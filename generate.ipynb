      " - While LSTNet is a novel method, it does rely on the local shape descriptor transformation idea, which is from Ling-Xiao Lu (2022). The connection to Ling-Xiao Lu (2022) could be clarified a bit more.\n",

However, one point of confusion is that the author's claim that their method outperforms all existing 3D correspondential methods seems to not be supported well.

      "1. In section 2.1 [2], the authors claim that the proposed framework can be trained with the Siamese Moment Matching loss, since it is rotation-free. However, in table 1, all of the prior correspondence estimation methods have been trained on Siamese Moment Matching loss, and thus the statement seems incorrect. Can the authors clarify this?\n",
      "2. In section 2.2, can the authors explain a bit more about why the loss in Table 1 is rotation (and translation) invariant in the context of LSTNet?  \n",

      "It is also very helpful if the authors can provide more details around their decoder training pipeline, for example the loss and how you get the correspondence in the decoder network. This could be a little bit more elaborate than in section 2.3 and in section 2.4 (see my minor comments)\n",

However, in table 1, all of the prior correspondence estimation methods have been trained on Siamese Moment Matching loss, and thus the statement seems incorrect. Can the authors clarify this? It looks like the loss in Table 1 could cause issues with LSTNet's rotation-free loss function that you claim.\n",
      "2. Would the authors clarify what the method can do when the point cloud data is not aligned in terms of global shape? Is this a limitation to the method? This is one possible area that can be improved. Is alignment only considered during the training phase?\n",
      "3. In section 2.3, could the authors briefly explain what \"corresponding points\" mean? It seems like they are the actual points that can be used for inference after training. It would be useful if they can quantify what is a \"corresponding point\", for example some distance distance thresholds or the point label in some way.\n",
      "4. In section 3.1 [3], is it not also true that given a matching pair of initial points, the global transformation parameters (rotation and translation) to transform the second point to be aligned with the first one would be needed. This makes it hard to achieve the goal of \"SO(3) invariant correspondences\". \n",
      "5. In section 5.2 [4], could the authors clarify what \"SO(3) consistent\" means? How does this align with SO(3) invariant correspondences and why is it critical?\n",

The authors proposed learning a local shape transform that can be applied element-wise to the input point cloud.

      "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a cornerstone in modern natural language processing, with their utility expanding to various applications and languages. However, the fine-tuning of multilingual LLMs, particularly for low-resource languages, is fraught with challenges steming from data-sharing restrictions (the physical border) and from the inherent linguistic differences (the linguistic border). These barriers hinder users of various languages, especially those in low-resource regions, from fully benefiting from the advantages of LLMs.\n",

Even under computational constraints, our method not only bolsters data efficiency but also facilitates mutual enhancements across languages, particularly benefiting low-resource ones. Compared to traditional local crosslingual transfer tuning methods, our approach achieves a 6.9\\% higher accuracy, reduces the training parameters by over 99\\%, and demonstrates stronger cross-lingual generalization.

I believe that it is more intuitive to use the quadratic function as $Q(p_i) = \\omega_i^{(N)} L(m; \\theta) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\omega_i^{(i)} L(p_i; \\theta)$. With this formulation, we can further study the global/local contributions of fine-tuning to each language model and user. I see that the authors have shown that the local contribution can be improved by the prompt distance. However, I think that the global contribution (parameter $Q$ of prompts) still needs studying.\n",
      "- In Section 4, I don’t see how the authors justify the hypothesis, i.e., the prompt diversity is proportional to the performance improvement of language models.\n",
      "- Section 6.1: this is not my area/topic, but in a general sense, it is interesting to see how the authors use model size, prompt diversity, and cross-lingual generalization to compare their method to the original. However, without further discussing how much the contribution is for each of these components, it is difficult to evaluate their technical contribution. I think the authors need to work on this by comparing the contribution of each one of these components to the result (in terms of both technical and empirical merits).\n",
      "- In Table 1, how did the authors obtain the number of prompts per language? is there a threshold to decide whether a prompt belongs to a language model?\n",

In addition, this paper mentions several works for transfer model by prompt tuning, such as LPM, DT, DPP-LTM.  Moreover, this paper mentions TPT, LLMF, and LLM.

This benchmark can thus be used to evaluate generalization performance of existing architectures and study their strengths and limitations in multimodal reasoning tasks. The results show that models that use cross-attention mechanisms between input domains perform better in some forms of generalization, but none are capable of productive compositional generalization, which is the most challenging problem of the benchmark. The authors therefore suggest that more research is needed to investigate the limitations of existing architectures and explore alternative approaches to achieving productive composition.\n",

What are the advantages of using this pre-trained model in the proposed method? Instead of focusing on these issues, the author uses an extensive number of pre-trained models, with most of the proposed models consisting of one-shot image-text learning. Furthermore, the proposed model has not been evaluated and can lead to overfitting in the pre-training process. \n",
