However, there are some serious problems with this paper: \n\nthe motivation and the related works. The argument that the lack of a relationship structure between multivariate variables needs to be addressed is inaccurate. There are several related works to study the variable relationships of multivariate time series forecasting, such as MTGNN [1], stemGNN [2], etc. It is a well-studied problem. I don\u2019t understand why the authors don\u2019t cite these important and famous related works and discuss the differences.  For the third motivation, there are several Linear complexity models such as N-BEATS [3]. The authors ignore this related work either. It is not appropriate. \n\nThe experiments are not convincing. By default, we don\u2019t consider variable relationships in benchmarks including ETT, Exchange or Weather coming from Informer and Autoformer. This makes the experimental results not fair when comparing with transformer-based forecasting models. The variable relationships (like graph structures) are always considered in another benchmark shown in MTGNN [1]. Also, some important baselines are missing, such as MTGNN [1], StemGNN [2]. All these points make the results less convincing. \n\n[1] Wu, Zonghan, et al. \"Connecting the dots: Multivariate time series forecasting with graph neural networks.\" Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery & data mining. 2020. \n\n[2] Cao, Defu, et al. \"Spectral temporal graph neural network for multivariate time-series forecasting.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 33 (2020): 17766-17778. \n\n[3] Oreshkin, Boris N., et al. \"N-BEATS: Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1905.10437 (2019).

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a graph and GCN based method for long-term time series forecasting. The method aims to deal with three challenges: 1. modeling relationship between variables, 2. modeling local dynamic changes, 3. improving efficiency. The method constructs three graph views from the input time series, and extracts features from the constructed graphs using GCNs. The features were used for prediction.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n1. Modeling correlation between variables in multivariate time series forecasting is important.\n2. The proposed investigates several ways of constructing relationships between variables.\n3. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed method is effective of modeling multivariate time series to some extent.\n\nWeakness\n1. Modeling multivariate time series by graphs and GNN has been studied before in multiple works (e.g., Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time-series Forecasting. In NeurIPS, 2020). The novelty of this paper is limited.\n2. The proposed method is straightforward, by constructing correlation graphs form multivariate time series in a feature engineering manner. The choices of the three graph views may be subjective.\n3. The method design is incremental upon several existing methods. Some design intuitions are unclear. For example, it is unclear on why to use GCN in Eq 6, 12, and 14 to process features. It seems to encourage smoothing in neighborhood, but the paper doesn't elaborate if how could this smoothing be important. Similarly, the differential operation in Eq 9, the linear layers in Eq 8, 12, and 14 are unclear.\n4. The method simplifies the normalization of adjacency matrices in Eq 7. There is no theoretical support for this simplification. The reason for the simplification is to reduce complexity. A complexity analysis should be provided to support Eq 7. Intuitively, because D matrix is diagonal. The complexity may not change much by skipping it.\n5. The Fig 1 seems inconsistent with the method description in Section 3. The input to dimension graph generator should be the output of the GCN on cross graph generator, and the input to the time graph generator should be the output of the GCN on the dimension graph generator. The Fig 1 does not reflect this sequential structure.\n6. It is not clear using the same method in Eq 11 and Eq 13, why the graph constructed in Eq 13 is a time graph.\n7. The training loss and training process of the proposed method are not clear. Some constraint to encourage the diversity of the multi-head attention could be included in the training loss.\n8. In the experiments, no graph based baseline methods were compared. Some of them should be included to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method. It is better to include confidence intervals in the tables in the experiments to demonstrate the statistical difference between different methods.\n",
