I couldn't find these proofs are given in the Appendix either. \n\nSome intuition about the definition of Gap-dependent observation thershold would be nice to have, similar to the baseline m value borrowed from Lattimore.  \n\nPlease add some causal graphs with candidate action sets for which admissable sequences or adjustment sets exist with latent confounders.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors study the problem of causal bandits with (arbitrary) combinatorial action spaces in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget pure exploration (simple regret) settings.  The causal graph is assumed to be known and all variables are binary valued.  The authors consider two cases.  For the first, the causal model is parameterized, with which parameters for most actions can be estimated from observational data and the rest are estimated using interventions.  The algorithm is based on the LUCB algorithm.  For the second (more general) case, the causal model is not parameterized and hidden nodes are available; the proposed algorithm overall has a similar structure as in the first case.   The authors also show that the sample complexity of the latter algorithm is nearly minimax optimal.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Major strengths\n\n1. The authors showed that for a particular parametric class of models (BGLM with bounded derivatives), since the difficulty of estimating the conditional mean of Y can be characterized by graph properties in such a way that actions can be separated into \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201chard\u201d actions, an LUCB style algorithm can be employed that significantly improves the sample complexity.\n\n2. The authors also generalize that strategy for the more general case with hidden nodes and for which the conditional distributions are not parameterized, and show the sample complexity of that algorithm is nearly minimax optimal.\n\n### Minor strengths\n\n1. The authors propose a fixed-budget pure exploration algorithm and analyze its regret (in supplementary material).\n\n2. The authors include some toy experiments for their methods (in supplementary material).  \n\n### Major weaknesses\n1. The storage and per-round computational complexities can be exponential in $n$ even for parameterized setting with the BGLM model.  Separate statistics are maintained for each action (eg Alg. 1 line 2) and updated (eg Alg. 1 line 11).  The action set is allowed to be an arbitrary subset of the powerset of $X$.  \n\n### Minor weaknesses\n1. The assumptions for the BGLM model used are quite strong \u2013 $\\theta$ parameters are non-negative, $f_X$ monotone, so that for any subset of nodes, it is immediate that the best intervention is to set all variables in that subset to value of 1.  Even for the slightly more general BGLM model without the same restrictions on \\theta or $f_X$ (but with bounded derivatives), it seems non-trivial to modify Algorithm 1 short of treating each realization as a separate action, growing the action set (and consequently storage complexity and per-round computational complexities) exponentially.  \n\n2. The readability could be improved by modifying notation or adding more verbal descriptors reminding the reader what notations refer to, especially those used sparingly -- eg $P_{S,Y}$ used to specify nodes along paths but P already used for probabilities; \\sigma introduced on page 5 for expected values and used once in Lemma 2 but already have \\mu notation for that.  The pseudocode of Alg 1 and 3 are heavy with notation and equations \u2013 the precise formulas could be discussed in the main text and referenced (or simplified).\n\n3. The storage and per-round computational complexities of the methods were not formally discussed in the main sections.\n\n\n\n### Questions \n1. Pg 3 Can you clarify what the sentence \u201cTo represent the native probability, \u2026\u201d means\n\n2. Pg 3 Can you clarify why in the BLGM model the probability mass functions are random?  The X\u2019s would be random even without the $e_X$ term.  More concerning to me is that you have an additive random term, but you are assuming that the sum is constrained in [0,1] to be a valid probability mass.  To me at least, that seems to induce a strange constraint of f_X and $e_X$ since if the terms are independent, then both need to be bounded.  If $e_X$ is bounded, then it is sub-Gaussian.\n\n3. Pg 4 \u201cWe assume that Xi\u2019s are Bernoulli random variables when we do not intervene any variables\u201d \u2013 What does that assumption mean?  They would have marginal Bernoulli distributions since they are binary valued, but they would have joint dependence.  \n\n",
