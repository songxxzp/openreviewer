            "summary_of_the_paper": "Entropy-regularized optimal transport is very popular today, but it leads to fully-dense transport plans. To address this problem, this work proposes a new approach for OT with explicit cardinality constraints on the transportation plan. Despite the non-convexity of the cardinality constraints, the work shows that the corresponding dual or semi-dual problems are tractable and can be solved with first-order gradient methods. This method can be treated as a middle ground between unregularized OT (case k=1) and quadratically-regularized OT( k is big enough). The smoothness of the objectives increases as k increases, giving rise to a trade-off between convergence speed and sparsity of the optimal plan.\n\nThe contributions are\n1. presents a dual and semi-dual framework for OT with general nonconvex regularization. The framework is applied to obtain a tractable lower bound to solve an OT formulation with cardinality constraints on the transportation plan. \n2. shows this framework is formally equivalent to using squared k-support norm regularization in the primal, this model is the middle point between the unregularized OT and the quadratically-regularized OT.\n3.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Optimal transport (OT) distances (a.k.a. Wasserstein's distances) are a powerful computational tool to compare probability distributions and they play an increasingly preponderant role in machine learning, statistics, and computer vision. Since computing OT distances involves a linear program, which takes super-cubic time in the data size, its large-scale applications have mainly been hampered by its high computational cost. A classical and popular approach to tackling this problem consists in adding an entropic regularization that can be solved using Sinkhorn iterations. Comparing to the (unregularized) OT that produces a sparse transport plan, the entropic penalty blurs the OT solution, namely, it entails a dense transport plan being undesirable for interpretability. Towards realizing a sparse solution, Blondel et al. 2018 (ICML) proposed to substitute the entropy penalty with the squared-$2$norm.\n\nIn this spirit of obtaining a sparse OT, this paper proposes a novel approach by working on a nonconvex penalty with control of the sparsity. In other words, the authors define the $k$-cardinality constraint penalty that controls the cardinality of non-zeros elements in each column of the transport plan. The idea is quite \"nice\" and seems interesting for many applications involving OT metrics. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strength ###\n- To the best of my knowledge, working with nonconvex regularization on OT problems is not well-known. This paper investigates the $k$-cardinality constraint, that forces each column to get at most $k$ non-zeros elements, avoids the spreading of masses in the OT solution. I really appreciate the finite analytic results about the relations between the primal, dual, and semi-dual forms of the objective functions.\n- The approach is strongly supported by theoretical findings. \n- As the OT community is a big fan of acronyms, so I can suggest the following acronym for this paper **Top-$k$-OT**.\n- Extensive numerical experiments are conducted on sparse mixture experts with good performances and on supply-demand transportation spherical data.\n\nI have a single question: what is the computational complexity of **Top-$k$ OT**?  One can complete Table 2 by adding time for the proposed algorithm. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. All the proofs are complete. \n- Code is not available, but I think reproducibility could be guaranteed since the authors detail the setting of each experiment. \n",

Specifically, based on the well known quadratic regularized optimal transport, the paper further constrains the cardinality of non-zeros entries of each column of the optimal plan. The problem of optimal transport with constrained sparsity is well motivated from expert assignment problem, and based on weak duality of the proposed optimization problem, efficient algorithm is proposed, with experiments provided.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper has the following strengths:\n1. The paper answers, in some sense, the question of how to make optimal transport plan more sparse, especially with proposition 3 where the paper introduces the k-support norm, which is of general interest and is a more principled way to enforce sparsity.\n2. The most notable result in the reviewer's opinion, is that it reveals the relations between the k-support norm regularization, and the sparsity of the OT plan. Though the strong duality does not hold, the sparsity constraint is still nicely carried from the original primal problem into the dual solution.\n3. The paper provides pretty strong application motivation of the sparsity-constrained optimal transport, e.g. the sparse mixture of experts.\n\nSome weaknesses:\n1. Though the paper claim it proposed a 'constrained' problem, it does not solve the primal constrained problem exactly. In fact, the paper finds feasible solution(s) to the original problem through minimax principle, but no approximate optimality is provided. It would be more natural if some tightness result between primal and dual formulations can be provided, as for the current paper the 'constraint' point of view is more of a heuristic formulation rather than a problem solved in the paper. (Maybe considering the tightness between $\\ell_2$ and $\\Psi$ can lead to it.)\n2. The paper claimed that the proposed formulation has increased smoothness when the constraint is looser, but the reviewer didn't find a concrete characterization of the increase of smoothness except for a figure illustrating this phenomenon. This point would be more valid and clear if some concrete measurement of smoothness can be added, and even a formal proof of such increase of smoothness.\n\nMinor comment: the paper claimed in [section 3][computation] that the entropic formulation is not smooth, which is unclear to the reviewer, since it is well known that the dual of entropic OT is sum of exponentiation of dual potentials which is very smooth, and the whole quantity is even smooth in marginals, see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08683.pdf , https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.07427.pdf .",
