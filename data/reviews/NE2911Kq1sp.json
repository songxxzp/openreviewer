CktGNN is a generation of the nested GNN structure to DAGs. The paper also presents a circuit benchmark dataset OCB with open-source code for automated circuit design methods evaluation.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The benchmark dataset has an empirical contribution to the field.\n2. CktGNN is empirically proven to achieve SOTA performance.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The discussion on the decoder (circuit design/generation) is too little.\n2. The method is an incremental development upon the nested GNN.\n3. The figures are hard to read due to the font size.\n4. The ability to design circuits automatically is not evaluated adequately in the experiments.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Novelty:\nCktGNN almost adopts the same structure as nested GNN, while only altering the outer GNN to DAG learning. Also, in the section discussing the method, a significant part of the content is about nested GNN, 1-WL algorithm, and VAE, making me feel that the novel part is limited.\n\nClarity:\nMost of the paper is quite clear. The description and the purpose of Theorem 3.2 might require more revision.\n\nReproducibility:\nThe code is available in the supplementary material.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The benchmark dataset provided has an unneglectable contribution to the field. However, the method itself doesn't offer much novelty. It's barely an application of the nested GNN.",

The expressiveness of the architecture is analysed showing that the method is more expressive than standard MPGNNs and a new dataset is proposed on which the method and related work are evaluated.\n\nContributions:\n\n1. domain knowledge dependent subgraph extraction for DAGs to extend NGNN\n2. expressivty analysis\n3. dataset + generation codes\n4. empirical evaluation",

The relation and impact of these should maybe be discussed, and if there is time, and ablation over the sensitivity towards ordering choice (e.g.  setting o(C)>o(R))  would strengthen the paper\n- either I missed them or the experimental details (optimiser choice, number of seeds etc) are missing and should be added, although they are in the supplementary code",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is clearly written (all important concepts are conveyed clearly), the evaluation needs more details (see weaknesses) and the overall quality is acceptable. Novelty might be argued against as it is an extension of an existing work,but I think the method found is non-obvious and properly analysed, with the dataset being a cherry on top.\n\n\nthere is also a typo in sectoin 3.3 \"trasnformed\" ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall this is a fine paper.
