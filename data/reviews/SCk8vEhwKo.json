Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of proposed attribute reconstruction framework.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n-- The attribute reconstruction problem in heterogeneous information networks is important. The topic of this paper is relative.\n\n-- The proposed method is effective in some extent, which is proved by many experiments.\n\n-- The method is introduced clearly and the paper is easy to follow.\n\nWeakness:\n\n-- The main contribution is a little incremental. In one hand, the framework is based on existing techniques. In the other hand, this paper does not provide any novel theoretical insights on this issue. \n\n-- In my opinion, the experiments are not quite sufficient in following two perspectives. 1) The defective attributes are not covered in the experiments. One of the main contributions is to jointly tackle missing and defective attributes. The adopted datasets naturally have missing attributes, but there are no evidences that the attributes of these datasets are defective. It's better to change the original attributes randomly or exploit some simple adversarial attacks on attributes to make the original attributes defective. 2) There could be more downstream tasks other than node classification. Attribute reconstruction is widely used in many scenarios e.g. anomaly detection, unsupervised or self supervised learning. It's better to show that the proposed ARHGA framework could support different downstream tasks to prove the effectiveness of ARHGA.\n\n-- Some typos and small writing problems, e.g. the mapping $\\phi$ in Equation (3) is not explained in the paper.",

The main idea of the paper is to subsample the graph and augment the attributes. The attributes were filled in using topological embeddings (based on random walk 2 vec on meta-paths) and a one-hope attention mechanism. \n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The idea of dealing with missing/corrupted attributes in heterogeneous graphs is appealing. The authors proposed a method to tackle the problem by leveraging techniques like subgraph random sampling, graph embedding/attentions, and dual losses (supervised/consistency) is sound. \n\nHowever, I do notice a similar method, HGNN-AC (WWW 21'). HGNN-AC is also cited in this work but not really thoroughly compared and discussed. Moreover, there is another similar method, (He et al., 2022). Both methods were only briefly mentioned in section 2. The only key difference that the author pointed out is they only complete missing attributes but do not fix defective attributes. Notably, both HGNN-AC and He et al., use almost an identical approach: random drop attributes, use topology embedding + attention, and dual losses (prediction loss + completion loss). The experiments also identically follow. \n\n1) The authors need to better explain the novelty of this work and how it compares to HGNN-AC. \n2) For experiments, only node classification was shown. Are there other possible tasks we can try? \n3) The experiments are solely based on dropping attributes, how about attributes corruption/defective attributes? \n4) How are \"defective attributes\" defined? Are there side effects of trying to update the attributes?\n5) Could we also do a comparison with He et al., 2022 work? I understand it is unsupervised but the results in table 3 from He's work looks similar to ARHGA. ",
