            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the problem of solving combinatorial optimization problems using reinforcement learning enhanced with bisimulation quotients, where the main idea is to reduce the search space by identifying states with identical paths in MDP. In particular, new models are designed for TSP and CVRP. The proposed methods are supplemented with experimental studies\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\nThe overall idea is reasonable: capturing symmetries in the system is expected to reduce the required training efforts and thereby facilitate good generalization. Most of the sections are well-written (module the technical part), and the studied problem is well-motivated. The presented experimental results suggest that the proposed method is promising.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- W1: The presentation of this paper lacks mathematical rigor, which makes its technical contribution less clear. \n  - Is $T$ a set of steps or a set of sequences of steps? Is $T^*$ a closure of $T$? Some notations on pages 2 and 3 are inconsistent.\n  - It would be better to formally define the concepts of being finalized, the new space $\\hat{S}$.\n  - Since the process is deterministic, should there be only one expansion?\n  - I am a little confused by the context around Proposition 1, especially by the claim that MDP is equivalent to solving the CO problem. The proof seems to show that MDP can simulate general Turing machines subsuming CO algorithms, which is well-known.\n  - The mapping $\\Theta$ introduced in Section 3 is desired but computationally hard to obtain in general. In addition, its role in the proposed model (Sec 4) is not very clear.\n\n- W2: Another major concern is that the designed model, as the main contribution, was described in a very abstract manner, and it is not clear how the ideas in the previous sections can be realized. Therefore, the novelty of this paper is not clear. The concrete contribution of this paper is entirely in the first paragraph of Section 4, but there are almost no technical details. As such, it seems that the proposed method can be obtained from the existing methods with very slight modifications. \n\n- W3: The paper could support reproducibility by including the source code. \n",

The paper only considers such mapping for two routing problems and it is not clear if such mappings would naturally exist for many other (particularly non-routing) combinatorial problems and whether they will prove useful in such problems.\n* The long theoretical discussion on general combinatorial optimization using MDP and bisimulation-quotienting seems somewhat disconnected from the actual neural approach. While it does seem to inspire such approach, the proposed neural approach could stand on its own as a new way of handling symmetries in routing problems. In particular, unlike the MDP framework built around rewards, the neural approach is trained using imitation.\n* The approach requires optimal solutions for training. Such optimal solutions are typically intractable to compute beyond certain problem size. This is an important difference from approaches like Kool et al. (2021) based on reinforcement learning that do not rely on ground-truth optimal solutions.\n\nMinor question: does \"AM bs1024\" indicate a beam search with beam width of 1024?",

However, the formulation seems specific for the TSP and CVRP. Thus, it would be more convincing if the authors could explain how the proposed formulation applies to other CO problems, such as mixed-integer linear programs. \n* The details about introducing the bisimulation quotienting into their proposed transformer-based model are unclear.

Then, the idea of bisimulation quotienting is introduced and how it is used to map TSP-MDP into path-TSP-MDP is discussed (in Section 3, with CVRP). With such formulation, a simple policy network that uses a Transformer (with slight modifications, e.g., removing PE) and is suitable for path-TSP-MDP (and its CVRP version) is proposed (Section 4), where the scalability of the model was empirically proven in a variety of experiments (Section 6).

The algorithm\u2019s applicability to non-Euclidean, non-symmetric COs is unclear.\n- High computational complexity since pure Transformer is used. It was shown that using efficient Transformer techniques makes generalization performance poor.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "### Clarity\n- Maths and notations seem correct, but more detailed descriptions will make readers understand better. Since I was not familiar with bisimulation and bisimilarity, I had to spend a lot of time to understand those concepts although I believe authors try their best to describe those concepts.\n  - e.g., in Section 3, it is mentioned that \u201cbisimilarity is equivalently defined as the largest bisimulation (the union of all bisimulations)\u201d but I couldn\u2019t fully understand what this means. \n  - In Figure 1, $\\equiv_{\\Phi}$ is used without definition.\n  - When the step space is defined in Section 2, $\\mathcal{T}^*$ is mentioned without definition.\n- In Section 4, \u201chence removing the need for a separate decoder\u201d; I guess this was stated since there\u2019s no need to use autogressive decoder, but I believe FF network after Transformer encoding can be regarded as a decoder. The same question for Section 4, Summary; authors state \u201cour model does not have a decoder\u201d.\n- In Section 4, \u201cNote that (optimal) solutions are not directly in the form of trajectories\u201d: can you please elaborate what it means?\n- In Section 4, Complexity, it would be better to describe how O(N^3) was derived, why standard encoder-decoder spend O(t^2) in more detail. \n### Quality\n- I think most of contents are well-written. \n- The results show the impressive empirical performance.\n- In Section C, authors use efficient Transformer (HyperMixer) to reduce the complexity but show that this harms the generalizability. Can you please elaborate why HyperMixer results in poor generalization? If this is simply because of using Layer Norm and not using ReZero, are there any alternatives other than HyperMixer? \n- At some point, it was unclear to me why training on small instances generalizes well to larger instances. For example, let\u2019s consider generalization for TSP 1000 when we have a trained model on TSP 100. From the very beginning of evaluation to the point where less than 100 nodes remain, I believe it\u2019s not possible to see any path-TSP states which were used to train the model.
