The main idea of the proposed method is simple but effective.\n\nHowever, there are several weaknesses:\n- Overall, the novelty of this paper is limited. The method proposed in this paper seems a combination of existing works, which mainly builds on the work of Mac Aodha et al. (2019) and Cole et al. (2021). Furthermore, the discussion of the main idea and the structure of the proposed method is too brief. I suggest the author discuss the main contributions of this paper and highlight the innovation compared with existing works, and describe the proposed framework more structurally.\n- The analysis of the experimental results is somewhat weak. It is mentioned in Section 2 that the authors will attempt to answer the question about what training loss is most effective, but in the section of experiments, this topic has not been discussed in depth, since no loss is best across all tasks according to the experimental results, it\u2019s better to discuss about why this happened, and analyze which types of tasks the different loss are applicable to? Furthermore, the authors conduct several variants to highlight the importance of the deeper location encoder in terms of learning an effective representation of space, however, the proposed method is only compared with the \u201csingle layer\u201d case, and it is not convincing enough to support the claim, and why the authors choose the network with four residual layers for location encoder?\n",

Traditional models need presence-absence data for training and are unable to take advantage of large-scale data. In contrast, with several scalable loss functions, the method in this paper can use large-scale presence-only data for the SDM problem. The paper also proposes 4 benchmark evaluation tasks to measure different aspects of the SDM problem and presents the experimental result conducted on these tasks to test the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n",

Firstly, there are some typos and grammar errors in this paper, e.g., line 4 of Section 1: to understanding -> to understand, line 2 of the 2nd paragraph of Section 2: decision tress -> decision trees, line 4 of Section 4.6: explicitly attempted -> explicitly attempt. Secondly, the description of the method is hard to understand. The paper needs to add illustrations for the proposed loss function, highlight the innovative contribution, explain and justify these loss functions in detail.\nThe technical novelty of this paper is not sufficient. The method in this paper only adopts the framework in \"Elijah Cole, Oisin Mac Aodha, Titouan Lorieul, Pietro Perona, Dan Morris, and Nebojsa Jojic. Multi-label learning from single positive labels. In CVPR, 2021.\" to define the loss functions, and use some classic neural network architecture to train the vector representation of space.\nThe experiment result is not convincing since the paper only evaluates the performance of the methods proposed in this paper and their variants on some self-collected datasets. The author needs to make comparisons to state of the art alternative methods and test the effectiveness of the proposed method on some widely recognized benchmarks in the species distribution modeling research domain.\nThe analysis of the experiment result is insufficient. The author only demonstrates the result, e.g., the \u201cbest\u201d loss depends on the task, and method rankings may not generalize across domains. The paper does not explain these results in detail.\n",

Does the time of the data overlaps with the training data? Is it ok if it does?\n7. Table 1. Geo Prior column. Is it in comparison to the model trained on images only? This should be specified\n8.
