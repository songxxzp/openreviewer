            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper addresses the problem of sample efficiency in RL by proposing a new episodic control approach. Episodic control consists of maintaining a table-like structure that can easily be accessed to return values associated with states/state-action pairs. The paper proposes NECSA, which introduces several novelties with respect to existing episodic control methods:\n\n1. It discretizes the state space and uses (1-, 2- and 3-state) tuples of discretized states as indices to the episodic memory (an _abstract state_);\n\n2. Each abstract state/state-action pair is mapped to a _score_, which is the average return of all episodes in which such abstract state appears;\n\n3. Scores are used as intrinsic rewards that complement the environment's original reward.\n\nThe proposed approach is shown empirically to outperform competing approaches in several continuous control benchmark problems.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strong points:**\n\nThe problem addressed in the paper - sample efficiency in reinforcement learning - is a relevant problem in reinforcement learning. The proposed approach follows several recent works on the topic of episodic control and -- to my knowledge -- is novel. The paper also strikes me as technically sound.\n\n**Weak points:**\n\nOverall, the writing of the paper could be improved for clarity. Mainly, I felt that Section 4 often went on to discuss some element that was not yet introduced, or was introduced only briefly, which made the presentation at times difficult to follow. \n\nAdditionally, the motivation for several choices in the proposed approach is not always evident. Examples include considering multi-step patterns, using scores, rather than returns, or using the scores as intrinsic rewards, rather than improving the policy evaluation. \n\n**Questions for authors**\n* The proposed approach strikes me as very similar to _reward shaping_. Specifically, the proposed intrinsic reward mechanism reminds me of potential-based reward shaping, where the scores actually play the role of potential function (and actually provide estimates of the value function). Is this the case? If so, can this relation to reward shaping explain the improved performance observed by the method?\n\n* Although the appendix provides some added discussion regarding the impact of discretization, how much does the discretization impact the performance of the algorithm? It seems to me that, if the discretization is too coarse, the performance of the proposed method will be significantly impacted. On the other hand, for large-dimensional problems, it seems to me that a fine discretization may render the proposed approach infeasible, due to the curse of dimensionality. In Section 5 the paper mentions the use of random projections in the Humanoid-v3 scenario, but I believe that more discussion on this aspect is necessary.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "**Clarity**\n\nAs mentioned above, although the paper is well-organized and the presentation does not have major flaws, I believe it could still be improved for clarity.\n\n**Quality**\n\nI believe that the quality of the paper, as a whole, is good. The paper is well organized and the presentation strikes me as technically sound.\n\n**Novelty**\n\nAlthough I am not too familiar with episodic control approaches, as far as I know, the proposed approach is novel. However, I would like to understand better the relationship between the proposed approach and reward shaping.\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\nI believe that the paper is reproducible.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel neural episodic-control based approach with state abstraction, named NECSA. The authors motivate their methods by utilizing latent information from historical behaviors, which has been overlooked by prior work. Specifically, this paper proposes a more comprehensive episodic memory, which consists of state abstraction, multi-step analysis of pattern transitions as well as a novel state measurement metric (reward confidence scores). The proposed algorithm is simple and clear. First, NECSA adopts grid-based state abstraction, tokenizing each state dimension, which achieves efficient state clustering. Second, it extracts patter transitions by sliding a N-step window on each trace and updates reward confidence scores for each patter transition into episodic memory. Third, the episodic memory is used to reform intrinsic reward during policy optimization, to encourage the policy to visit states that lead to highly-rewarded trajectories. Experiments on MuJoCo continuous control tasks demonstrate that the proposed approach works well and outperforms state-of-the-art parameteric methods and non-parameterized episodic-control based baselines. Extensive experiments are conducted for ablation study and hyper-parameter sensitivity. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n+ The proposed approach is technically sound, novel, scalable and works well across a wide range of continuous control tasks compared with state-of-the-art RL baselines.\n+ The idea of building a more comprehensive episodic memory is interesting and differs from existing episodic-memory based approaches, which may benefit the research in related communities.\n+ The authors demonstrate a full experimental analysis for the approach, revealing the main contributions, which makes the whole methods more convincing.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- NECSA seems a little bit sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. For instance, the optimal value of \\epsilon differs across tasks (e.g., 0.2 for Walker2d-v3, 0.1 for Hopper-v3).\n- The method so far has been limited to small steps of transition patterns (m=3).\n- NECSA was not evaluated on discrete domains such as Atari games (which is the most popular benchmark for most of episodic control based work).",

Related work is fully survey. The authors discuss about both limitation and advantages of NECSA.\n\nThe results are significant, and the writing quality is good. The proposed approach is novel. The authors report most of hyper-paremeter settings and open-source code. I believe this approach can be reproduced.\n\n\nTypos:\n1. Section 2.1, concrete action space -> continuous action space\n2.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\nThe contributions are clearly stated and suitable experiments are proposed to validate the paper claims.\n\nBoth the grid abstraction and multi-step analysis are interesting ideas that seem to work well in the explored context.\n\nThe method performs well on a variety of Mujoco tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe notations and overall math of the paper could really be improved (for instance using \\pi(\\cdot | s), s_{t + 1}, r(s, a), etc), though I do not think this is a major issue for the comprehension in the current state of the paper.\n\nThe code and data (unless I am wrong) are not available at the specified URL.\n\nThe grid definition is ad-hoc to state spaces with a relatively limited number of components (though it works for Humanoid). Do you have ideas to extend it to synthetic/natural images for instance? This would make the method applicable to other environments (e.g. DMControl, Atari, etc).\n\nI would advocate for a short description of how the gaussian random projections work in 4.1. This is an important component of the method whose details are currently missing.\n\nI would also like the paper to have a small explanation of how actions are handled when using state-action pairs for grid abstraction.\n\nDid you try different intrinsic rewards? While it appears natural to reward state-action pairs proportionally to how much their average return is superior to the average over all state-action-pairs, it might be interesting to use an advantage approximation as reward instead: the approximate advantage could be $\\c(s_t, a_t) - \\mathbb{E}_{a \\sim \\pi}[c(s_t, a)]$ for instance. This would connect the method with Advantage Learning methods (Baird, 1995).\n\nIn Table 1, it is stated that \u201cthe best average returns\u201d are reported. Does that mean that only the average return of the best seed is reported? If so, I recommend to report the average over seeds instead (and standard deviation).   \n\nThe impact of the paper would be greater with DMControl experiments included (but that requires an extension to the grid abstraction).\n",

            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is well-written, and makes for an enjoyable read. Contributions are backed by relevant experiments. The method is conceptually simple and elegant.\nThough, as I mentioned in my comments, the lack of extension of the grid abstraction to images limits the relevance of the ideas presented, due to the nature of benchmarks in Deep RL. Also, most of the notations could be reworked (see comments).\n\nI am borderline recommending for acceptance since I like the paper and its ideas but I really think that the mentioned extension would really improve its potential impact.\n",
