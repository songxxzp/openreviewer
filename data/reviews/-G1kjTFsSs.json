The author proposed the Async-KernelUCB algorithm with $\\tilde O(\\sqrt(T))$ regret and only $O(N^2)$ communication complexity. In addition, both the Synthetic and real-world experiments show that Async-KernelUCB outperforms other algorithms, which supports the efficiency of the Async-KernelUCB algorithm.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1. The author provided the first analyses of asynchronous kernelized contextual bandits and proposed a novel algorithm, Async-KernelUCB, with a theoretical guarantee.\n\n2. Both the Synthetic and real-world experiments show that Async-KernelUCB outperforms other algorithms, which supports the efficiency of the Async-KernelUCB algorithm.\n\n3. Compared with previous studies on kernelized contextual bandits, the Async-KernelUCB algorithm further solves the problem of different dictionary copies in an asynchronous environment, providing enough technique novelty.\n\nWeakness:\n\nIn section 3.2, the author mentions that Nystrom approximation can help reduce computation and communication costs. However, it is better if the author directly indicates the computation complexity for equations (1) and (2) to show how Nystrom approximation improves efficiency.",

Unfortunately, due to the time limitation, I do not have enough time to check the proof in the appendix. Thus I choose a low confidence level.",

One key among the algorithm design is that the communication threshold ensures that little rewards are not involved in the calculation and the communication cost is saved.\n1. In Section 4.3, the author(s) clarifies that the key challenge --- to achieve low regret and low communication cost --- is overcome with a dictionary.\n1. Experiment results look reasonable.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Is there a matching lower bound?",
