The proposal can achieve similar performance as state-of-the-art baselines, while can find helpful logic patterns under some restricted scenario which no previous work can find.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strength\n\n- This method proposes a diiferentiable logic rule method on knowledge graph which can deal with time range related rules which has no previous works.\n\n## Weakness\n\nA lot of notations and explanations need to be refined for clarity.\n\n-  In section 4, why call the first kind Markovian? I think Markovian refers to the case that current state is only determined by previous state. However, in your case, current random walk step is not determined by previous random walk step, instead, it is determined by a given relation type and given starting time which never changes in a random walk.\n- Isn't Eq (6) wrong? In the left side, v is subscripted by length, while in the right side, v is subscripted by node identity.\n- You should specify the dimension of each variable and function for Eq (8-13). It is very hard for me to understand the process there.\n- What is $h_{0, l}$ in Eq (8)? Simply 0 as common RNN?\n- Why this random walk embedding  Eq (8-12) only cares the context relation $r_h$, and ignores relations in the random walk?\n- Can you provide the exact computation for all four temporal feature modeling? The definition is too vague for me to confidently understand.\n- I do not see the usage of recurrence and duration in Eq (14-17).\n- In section 5, it says that you will use all possible pathes between two nodes for both training and inference. So there is no \"random\" walk. Isn't this very costy?\n\nEmpirical result is not satisfying.\n\n- On only two datasets, TILP does not show clearly better performance than TimePlex. Given the fact that this method is not incremental (does not need to store full history of temporal graph), this performance is not impressive.\n- Although this paper shows TILP has the potential in restricted scenario, I am not sure if those hypothesis is interesting in tKG field or has no previous works, since I am unfamiliar with this field.\n- It is unclear why TLogic works extremely worse since time range logics can be expressed by timestamp logics, thus I will expect similar performance.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The clarity is bad for me, but may due to the lack of background.\nQuality is fine.\nThe method and studying scenario is novel, however I am not sure if those scenarios are interesting due to the lack of background.",

However, the empirical gain is limited compare with existing baselines.
