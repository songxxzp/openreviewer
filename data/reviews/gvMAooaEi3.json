For example, the issue raised in the intro does not seem to exist in the CTDE framework (not a game setting). \n- What are the forms of (1) and (2) when there are multiple agents? So are (3)-(7). Right now everything is done with n=2. \n- Following the above comment, it appears that most of the derivation and most experiments are done for a 2-user case (or two coordinating agents with others). While the reviewer understands the tractability of this case, it seems a bit limited that even in the experiments only two agents are considered. \n- Where is the projection step in the algorithms? Also, what is the complexity for doing so? \n- The presentation is a bit confusing. In Fig. 2,  LA-MADDPG and LOLA-MADDPG are both marked as \u201cours\u201d. But in Table 3, only HR-MADDPG has this label. From the text, it seems that the paper applies the ideas to LA-MADDPG and LOLA-MADDPG. Please clarify. \n- It would be useful to highlight the key difference between the proposed algorithms and MADDPG. Right now the novelty of the algorithm is not clear. \n- Minor: \u201cbetween the agents\u201d should be \u201camong the agents\u201d",
