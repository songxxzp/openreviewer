            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents GoBigger, a platform for studying cooperative and competitive behavior at large scale. The game is inspired by Agar. Even if the design of an environment like that described in the paper might be valuable for the community, it is difficult to identify clear technical contributions in this work. The authors tested the platform using implementations of algorithms, namely DQN and PPO for single-agent algorithms and QMIX, MAPPO, COMA and WMIX for multi-agent environments. The authors showed the results of a comparative analysis of the algorithms but the results appear rather standard and not particularly insightful. It is also worth noting that the implementation of the system itself appears to be rather standard in terms of design and implementation choices.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n+ The authors have developed a platform that might be beneficial for the community at large.\n\nWeaknesses\n- It is difficult to identify a clear novel technical contribution in this work. For sure, the reviewer commends the fact that the authors made a new environment available to the research community. \n- The authors do not clarify and discuss the types of studies that are enabled by this platform. Which questions will the community be able to answer through it? What are the limitations of the platform? What are the specific novel insights that a researcher can derive from adopting this testbed/environment?\n- The goal of the evaluation presented in this work should be clarified. In fact, this appears as a paper presenting a platform, but most of the paper is devoted to the analysis of existing algorithms used for playing the game supported by the environment. The authors should perhaps rethink the scope and the focus of the paper. At the moment, unfortunately it does not appear sufficiently focussed.\n- The authors say that the main contribution is the study of collaborations inside a team and across teams (and competition). This is not clearly discussed in the paper in my opinion. I would also argue that other environments allow for this type for analysis - for example the Hide and Seek game is performed by teams and not by single agents (it is an environment where the agents collaborate and compete at the same time).\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The contribution of this work is limited in terms of novelty and originality. \n\nThe authors provide limited information in terms of design and implementation of the algorithms used in the implementation. For this reason, the reproducibility of this work is somehow limited.\n\nThere are limited details about the implementation of the platforms. The information related to the selection of the hyperparameters of the algorithms is also somehow limited.\n\nMinor issues include the readability of the plots (see for example Figure 3), which should be improved. At the moment, it is very hard to judge the performance results presented in the figures.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this work makes a contribution to the research community in terms of the platform itself, but its novelty is somehow limited both in terms of the design and implementation of the environment itself and the evaluation of the algorithms presented in the paper. In general, it is difficult to understand the specific insights that it is possible to obtain from adopting it compared to other existing environments.",

However, why extending a two-team multi-agent simulation to a multi-team simulation is challenging?\n\n- The scenario of the simulation is relatively simple.

Other than the multi-player Agar game, what do real-world applications share characteristics similar to this simulation?\n\n- While experiments generally show that this simulator can be used to evaluate multiple RL and MARL methods, how do the experiments demonstrate this simulator is better than the previous MARL simulators?\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a novel multi-agent RL environment which extends existing game Agar with multiple teams, thereby enabling M x N style games. A single agent in the game manages up to 16 growing cloned balls, which need to be increased in size to gain more rewards. The resulting action space has a discrete- (type of action - move, eject, split) and continuous component (direction of movement). The approach is evaluated for the different configurations of the environment for both single agent as well as multi-agent RL algorithms. The results show the tendency for cooperation. Lastly, the authors also conduct an ablation study.",

The claim should be better explained / backed up with further analyses. If there is a theoretical point to be made, it would fit nicely in the motivation and related work, but pointers to empirical results (showing sufficiently more coordination for the new environment) would be helpful as well.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: The paper is written sufficiently clear. The game dynamics are well-introduced and the configuration options are understandable. The appendix also includes more practical examples of using the environment.\nQuality: The proposed environment is a sensible multi-agent and multi-team game. It builds on an established game and enables to study coordination and competition. \nNovelty: At this point, the novelty compared to Neural MMO is not completely clear given the points I made in the other sections. It should be better argued in the paper why and how coordination is better.\nReproducibility:  The empirical results are documented sufficiently well and since the authors open-source their code, the results can be reproduced.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The proposed environment is interesting. In essence, the game enables the study of cooperation and competion between multiple teams, and has a well-defined logic and resulting game complexity. The comparison to other environments is quite clear. The paper provides a well-structured oview of the main competitors and builds its case on enabling more than two teams to compete and enabling the better study of cooperation. To this end, it is difficult for me to see if the claim about lack of cooperation for main competitor Neural MMO is evident. Is it that Neural MMO is to easy to drive coordination? Or maybe the other extreme, is the logic so difficult to allow for complex behaviour with current algorithms?  The conducted evaluation for the proposed environment shows that teams are coordinating to win and not merely try to fight individual opponents by themselves, which shows that coordination is essential for winning. Is this a strategy evolving over time or occuring rather fast? To sum up, I see that the environment has its merits, but am not (yet) conviced of the novelty.",
