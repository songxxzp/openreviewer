            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper considers domain generalization person re-identification without demographics (DGWD-ReID), which is more difficult than cross-domain person ReID (CD-ReID) and DG-ReID but closer to the real-world scenario because the domain and camera labels are not always available for privacy problem. Innovatively, in order to deal with the uncertainty of domain distribution, the author improved distributionally robust optimization(DRO) by reformulating the minimax optimization as an important sampling problem and named it Unit-DRO. Moreover, the author introduced a multi-step solution and a weighted queue to further improve its performance. The multi-step solution can determine a hyper-parameter adaptively by the training step and the weighted queue can help to estimate the weights better and solve the problem that \u201cstochastic mini-batch training\u201d causes. Sufficient experiments demonstrate that the approach is even better than most approaches with demographics.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n(1) Demographics information is not used, and the problem studied is more realistic;\n(2) The author innovatively puts forward the Unit-DRO and it is simple and efficient;\n(3) The author makes an in-depth analysis of the shortcomings of the Unit-DRO and proposes a multi-step solution and a weighted queue to get better performance;\n(4) The experimental results are better than other CD-ReID and DG-ReID methods in the absence of demographics.\n(5) Mathematical analysis and ablation studies are sufficient.\n\nWeaknesses: \n(1) There is a lack of a framework diagram that can visually demonstrate the method proposed;\n(2) Partial experimental results are quite worse than the state-of-the-art, like \u201cSource Market1501 & Target Market 1501\u201d;\n(3) Some of the figures or tables are not clearly illustrated, like the horizontal axis of each chart in Figure4;\n(4) Lack of detailed analysis of the ReID task itself and the adaptability of the proposed method to the ReID task.\n",

These strengths can convince me to accept the paper. However, the paper still needs some improvement in some respects. Firstly, the author should analyze in more detail the adaptability of its approach to the ReID task. Secondly, the author would better present their method more visually with an overall framework.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a more general setting for person re-identification, i.e., domain generalizable person re-identification without demographics (DGWD-ReID). Based on the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method for addressing the underlying uncertainty of domain distribution, it proposes a variant of DRO, named Unit-DRO, specifically for DGWD-ReID. Experimental results show the better performance of the proposed method compared to other baselines. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros: \n(1)\tThe use of DRO for DGWD-ReID is technically sound. \n(2)\tModified from the existing KL-DRO, the proposed Unit-DRO seems to work well for DGWD-ReID.\n(3)\tThe extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nCons:\n(1) This paper claims a more general setting, i.e., DGWD-ReID. However, it's more of an easy-to-use approach, using only subject ID labels in DG-ReID. It can indeed be considered an improvement, but not a setting that is only suitable for real-world scenarios. Only the domain label and camera ID label don't seem to reveal so much location and environment information, which might be easier to know from the image background itself. Also, compared to the domain and camera ID, annotating subject ID seems to be much more expensive. \n\n(2) This paper largely criticizes the demographic information (e.g., domain labels, camera IDs) used in existing DG-ReID methods. Even if the mentioned concerns (e.g., mainly privacy concerns) are true, we can also redefine demographic information without involving privacy concern. For example, we can apply clustering on all training sources, and assign the domain labels to different cluster centers (e.g., natural background or structured background). Training and the test evaluation might benefit if such obtained demographic information is also involved.\n\n(3) As mentioned in the \u201cBaseline Algorithm\u201d of Section 3, similar to MetaBIN, the proposed method uses a mixture of batch normalization and instance normalization with learnable parameters. However, as discussed in MetaBIN, direct Batch-Instance Normalization may not generalize successfully on a given unseen target domain, so they use a meta-learning pipeline. How does the proposed method solve the problem without a meta-learning pipeline? Some discussion is necessary.\n\n(4) As for the ablation study in Table 7, all of them are for different Unit-DRO components. How about the baseline without Unit-DRO and the baseline with KL-DRO (as Unit-DRO is modified from KL-DRO)?\n\n(5) Some methods or labels in Table 5 and 6 are not defined. For example, in Table 5, what are A-IN, IBN, A-SN, IN stand for? In Table 6, what are the domains \u201cP\u201d, \u201cA\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cS\u201d, \u201cV\u201d and \u201cL\u201d? Besides, in Table 3, there are two MetaBINs. What is the difference?\n\n(6) Minor points: in the abstract, \u201cunweighted\u201d might be \u201cup-weighted\u201d.\n",

In Line 7 of Algo. 1, does the model trained with Unit-DRO only use the cross-entropy loss function? Since in the last paragraph of Sec. 3, both cross-entropy and triplet losses are used as the baseline. \n2.  Ablation studies in Tab. 7 are a little simple. It is unable to show a clear advantage of the proposed component by comparing results from two or three lines. Besides, how to select the optimal values for $\\tau^{*}$ and |M|. I think they are either important or sensitive to the results.  As mentioned in Sec. 4.1, the scheme of multi-step $\\tau$ seems complicated.  And in Tab. 7, it just simply compares the results with two options of M\n3. In Tab. 3, there are two lines reporting the results of the same methods but with different numerical values\n",
