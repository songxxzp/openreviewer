The differential privacy guarantee, in a graph context, would imply that a difference of one graph element would not be noticeable to an adversary under noise addition. However, this guarantee says nothing about the ability to derive large-scale graph properties, which could threaten the privacy of individual indeed. Past research has shown [CIKM 2012] that most graph measures can be recovered under noise addition, and that it is hard to even obscure the length of a path in a graph structure. This paper appears to be incognizant of such concerns, as well as of the limitations of differential privacy when it comes to sharing correlated structural idea. Thus, it is not clear what consequences the proposal local differentially privacy algorithms have in effect. A discussion of these concerns is due.",

It is weird that one can claim the privacy of the GNN training algorithm without involving the GNN in the analysis.\n\n2) The lemma and theorem are essentially stated without proof. Either they are incorrect or they are direct applications of existing results. In either case, there is little novel technical contribution.\n\n3) The clarity can be improved. Below are some concrete cases that are unclear in writing.\n\n- Section 4.1.3 states that \"We use the randomized response as the randomization mechanism\". The \"randomized response\" method should be explained with citations. \n- Algorithm 1 states that randomization will be applied to edges to the neighborhood of each node plus lambda nodes. But section 4.1.3 states that randomization will be applied to every edge. \n- Lambda is defined as an integer in Algorithm 1 indicating a number of nodes. In section 4.4, there is a phrase \"lambda percentage of nodes\", which is confusing.\n\n4) Typos.\n\n- Page 5. \"... is too less, ...\" -> is too small\n- Page 5 and Algorithm 1. A_v not defined.
