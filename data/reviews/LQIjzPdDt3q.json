The main contribution of the paper is to show that under a data distribution with good coverage, we can enable sample-efficient online RL. The paper introduces a new notation, called coverability which is weaker than the concentrability coefficient in offline RL and shows that it is enough for sample-efficient online RL. In addition, the paper also shows (1) several weaker notions of coverage which are sufficient for of\ufb02ine RL, but insufficient for online RL; (2) existing complexity measures for online RL such as Bellman rank and Bellman-Eluder dimension are insufficient for sample-efficient online RL. \n\n",

A very recent result under review of ICLR 2023 [1] shows that under the Concentrability assumption as Definition 1 (similar to the coverability assumption as the paper proposed), it is enough to achieve an \"optimal\" offline RL, without any interaction with the environment. These results seem correct to me. Then, \n - If we can access offline data and assume that offline data has good coverage as stated in Definition 2 (lower bound of Concentrability assumption), so do we really need the online RL?\n - If we really still need the online RL, then it seems that the coverability condition on offline data that the paper proposed is not enough weak to keep a sample-efficient online RL.    \n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=ZsvWb6mJnMv&referrer=%5BReviewer%20Console%5D(%2Fgroup%3Fid%3DICLR.cc%2F2023%2FConference%2FReviewers%23assigned-papers)",

The authors compare their notion with existing notations for both online and offline RL, which addresses the necessity and novelty of their findings. The example of block MDP is also a good point, which shows how the authors' findings can actually result in a sharper sample complexity, compared with previous works. \n\nWeakness:\n\n1. Part of the technical contribution is limited, since the algorithm and some of the analysis are directly copied from existing works. However, it shouldn't be considered as a big problem since the paper itself is mainly focused on the analysis instead of the algorithm design, and the paper does show its own novelty in the regret analysis. \n",
