            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposed to incorporate Coulomb potential, London dispersion potential and Pauli repulsion potential in the input features of deep learning models, in order to deal with the long range interactions in PBC systems like crystal materials. It is proved that the proposed model outperforms SOTA in two material datasets: The Materials Project and JARVIS. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: the motivation and idea of the paper is awesome. Traditional neural networks for molecular property prediction usually use local information as atom features, which limits the description for long-range interactions. However, unlike short range interactions which involves complicated electronic structure, the formula of long-range interactions are usually easy. So incorporate fix-formula is a promising solution for long-range interactions.\n\nWeakness: The paper has a fatal mathematical error, which invalidate the computation of Coulomb part. The error occurs in Appendix C.1. In formula (31), it is ... e^{-|Lk+v|t}, but in formula (32), it is miswrote as ... e^{-t|Lk+v|^2}. In appendix C.2, C.3 and C.4, it is e^{-t|Lk+v|^2} everywhere. This error is fatal because if we change e^{-t|Lk+v|^2} back to the correct e^{-t|Lk+v|}, the Poisson summation (39) does not hold, so the summation of Fourier term (40) also does not hold. In fact, if the authors did not make the mistake, the analytic continuation of infinite summation of Coulomb potentials should be diverged, similarly to the fact that Riemann zeta function diverges at s=1.",

Also, it is not clear to what extent this is just application of a known result/method, or if this is a novel mathematical result. In case there is something substantially new in the methods, this should be in the main paper in my opinion. I did not carefully check the derivations in the appendix.\n\nI expected to see comparison with other GNN approaches where the cutoff was varied, to be able to more directly understand the importance of the infinite summation. It is not clear from the paper (but from the references) what the cutoff was set to in e.g. the SchNet comparison (5\u00c5 i think)\n\nEDIT: (after reading FZse's review) Since the electrostatic (Coulomb) potential is summed infinitely for each (charged) atom, does that not mean that these individual sums in general will diverge, even though the system is electrically neutral? \n",

With the computations of complete interatomic potentials, the representation learning is performed through message passing neural networks. Evaluation experiments are also performed on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks, showing the proposed method leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable computational costs.",

The comparisons in efficiency between the proposed method and direct DFT calculations was not made. Similarly, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method compared with the machine learning potentials using the constructed vectors as crystal structure input.",

It has two main innovations in the field of crystal material modeling using graph neutral networks. It is the first time that the interatomic potentials are directly as edge features and it is the first time to models the complete set of potentials among all atoms though there are some approximations.\n\nConsidering the detailed description was given in the paper, the proposed method is reproducible, but it is still complicated in practice.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper proposed a novel graph deep learning method, PotNet, which can improve the performance of the graph neural networks potentials in the field of crystal material modeling with certain computational costs. However, compared with the existing method, the gain of the proposed method in accuracy is not remarkable with the time costs of about 4 times. It is better to illuminate the specific application situations where the proposed method has more pronounced effect or further improve the algorithms to achieve faster implementation.",
