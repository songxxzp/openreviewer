Instead, the authors state that the operator norm, which indicates how much the filter affects the output during operation, is a good\ncriterion and can be obtained through SVD.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- The paper is written clearly and easy to understand.\n\nWeaknesses\n-  As claimed in the paper, in order to judge the influence of the filter only from the maximally stretched direction point of view and ignore all other directions, it seems the largest singular value in SVD should be much larger than other singular values. That is, in Figure 1, \uc5d0\uc11c Y=FX=(\u03c3_1 u_1 w_1^T )X+(\u03c3_2 u_2 w_2^T )X\u2248(\u03c3_1 u_1 w_1^T )X seems to hold, but there is no explanation for this.\n- This paper proposes a passive filter pruning method, but there is no explanation or comparison about the advantages compared to the active method.\n- In the image classification experiment, the MNIST dataset and the VGG16 model alone are insufficient to guarantee the performance of the proposed method.\n- In Figure 6, the criteria for determining the pruned layers are not specified, and I am not sure what the meaning of comparing only some layers is pruned.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- This paper is clear and easy to understand because figure(s) summarizes the contents of the paper well.\n- This paper used SVD for passive filter pruning without dataset intervention.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a weight-based pruning criterion that considers the contribution of the filters in yielding outputs. The importance score is computed using the SVD on the flattened filters and their rank-1 approximation. The experiments are conducted on vanilla convolutional neural networks without residual connections.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- The proposed method that computes the contribution of filters in producing output is intuitive.\n- The experiments for audio-scene classification, which have been less explored in pruning papers, look interesting.  \n- Figures 1\u20134 are very helpful for understanding the proposed method; especially, Figure 2 clearly describes the differences between the norm-based filter pruning and the proposed method.\n- The ideas in the paper are sufficiently simple for people to build on.\n\nWeakness\n- The experimental validation is very weak. For visual classification, the authors performed VGG-on-MNIST experiments solely, which cannot fully support the superiority and applicability of the proposed method. In contrast, recent works (e.g., Molchanov [2019]., Lin [2020], Sui [2021]) always include the experiments with ResNets on ImageNet as well as CIFAR to show the merits of their methods. I would highly recommend the authors to add empirical support on ImageNet and CIFAR with various architectures including ResNets. In particular, how can the proposed method be applied/extended for residual blocks?\n- Furthermore, the baselines seem very weak: only the comparison to L1-norm and geometric median pruning (which are classical methods nowadays) was conducted. It would be helpful to include additional recent baselines (e.g., L1 Slimming (Liu et al., 2017), Polarization Regularization (Zhuang et al., 2020), Deep Hoyer (Yang et al., 2019)) to demonstrate the superiority of this work. \n- I was not able to identify a clear superiority of the proposed method over the baselines, especially in the VGG-MNIST experiments. In addition, in the DCASE21-DCASE-20 case in Figure 7(b), the results of the operator norm method and those of the GM-based one look very similar at the pruning ratio of 25% and 50%; I think the performance drop at the large pruning ratio (75%, 90%) may be unacceptable and thus the comparison at these ratios may be useless.\n- As the authors describe the merits of structured pruning over unstructured pruning include actual inference speedup, it would be good to measure the latency on high-end and/or edge GPUs.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Some pruning methods (Lin et al., 2020; Yeom et al., 2021) apply SVD to features maps to measure the amount of information, but this paper does to weights. It would be helpful to compare these feasure-based and weight-based pruning criteria and discuss pros and cons.\n    - Lin et al., HRank: Filter Pruning using High-Rank Feature Map, CVPR'20 \n    - Yeom et al., Toward Compact Deep Neural Networks via Energy-Aware Pruning, arXiv'21\n- The paper is well written and easy to understand.\n- I think the empirical validation is too weak and additional experiments with ResNets on large-scale vision datasets are necessary.\n- typo: 6p, unrpuned networks at p = 25% -> unpruned\n",
