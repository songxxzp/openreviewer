This new loss function helps capture the shape of time-series sequences. The authors tested the effectiveness of the new loss function on multiple datasets and models.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The authors have done a thorough literature review on the SOTA methods, models, and metrics on time series forecasting.\n2. The authors also have experimental results to compare the proposed loss function and the other two metrics with 4 SOTA models on 5 datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. 'The output Y_hat should have similar temporal dynamics with Y.'\nThis is a strong assumption without much justification. It will be helpful to elaborate on why temporal dynamics are important and give examples of how they benefit time series forecasting in reality.\n2. The definition of temporal dynamics, and distortion is quite fuzzy. It is necessary to give mathematical definitions for these two concepts.\n3. The authors criticized that DILATE handles time scaling with DTW and phase shifting with TDI but did not explain the link between DILATE and the new loss function. It will be good to have a separate section to clearly explain the relationship between DILATE and TILDE-Q. Is it beneficial to merge these metrics into one?\n4. The Fourier transform is one of the classical ways to analyze time series data and the authors used the Fourier coefficients for phase shifting. However, it is not clear how to define dominant frequency.\n6. Ablation study is not complete.\nIt is not clear how the authors tuned hyperparameters alpha and gamma to generate results in Tables 1-4 which is critical to justify the effectiveness of the new metric. Thoroughly tuning these parameters can help get better results than roughly tuning compared loss functions like DILATE. It is encouraging that the authors showed some results of tuning alpha in the Appendix but still no result w.r.t. gamma is available.",

The paper starts with formal definitions of common time-series distortions and then designs 3 loss components that are invariant to 3 types of distortion. The experiment results suggest that the new loss function is model-agnostic. It can improve the accuracy of different existing time-series models, even on common existing metrics such as MSE or DTW.\n\n",

It provides a systematic study of different time-series distortions and builds up invariant loss components from there.\n  - The paper is well-presented, with clear notations and figures. The appendix is also very useful with detailed experiment setup and qualitative results.\n  - The new loss function yields significant accuracy improvements across different time-series models on various datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n  - The paper does not study the loss components' weights $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$. How sensitive are those hyper-params? What happens if we change them, qualitatively and quantitively?\n  - TILDE-Q itself is not invariant to any of the amplitude shifting, phase shifting, and uniform amplification distortions.\n  - Maybe it is worth studying what happens if we add MSE to TILDE-Q loss.\n  - The paper claims that \"time-series forecasting models should aim to both accurately forecast the value for each time-step and the prediction should have similar shapes as those in original time-series\". This is not necessarily true. In practice, time-series forecasts deliver value by allowing future planning. Therefore, the cost of a specific error or distortion in the forecast depends strongly on the kind of planning we use the forecast for.",
