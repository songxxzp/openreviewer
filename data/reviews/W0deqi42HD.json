            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper tackles the problem of the estimation of the effect of a treatment with specific reference to the problem of comparing different treatments on given outcomes. The author/s describe/s a framework obtained by combining transformer-based pre-training with fine-tuning by calling it CURE, which is specifically designed for observational data. In particular, the CURE framework is first trained on unlabled data with the aim to obtain a contextual representation of patients, then a fine-tuning step exploits the few available labeled data for comparing the effect of two treatments on a given outcome of interest. The main contributions of the paper, in my understanding, are the sequential encoding devoted to represent longitudinal patient data, an embedding that the paper states to incorporates both structure and time. A second contribution is represened by a set of numerical experiments, togheter with their associated results that, according to what the author/s state/s also share the interesting property of data scalability.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- the problem tackled is a relevant and urgent one\n- results of numerical experiments seems to witness the proposed approach compares favourably to state of the art methods\n- the idea of pre-training using unlabled data is useful, even if in a general context it is not new.\n\nWeaknesses\n- the issue of missing data is not taken into account, while this is a major one in the case where observational data are taken into account in the health care domain\n- some aspects about the assumptions and type of issues that are taken into account are not clear, i.e., I read \"The model trained for one particular problem or data may fail to generalize to other scenarios.\", what do you precisely mean by generalization? interval validity, external validity ?\n- the assumption of positivity is a strong one and I wonder whether it can hold in the practical domain presented by the paper, at least I would like to have seen in the results that the author/s take into account and discuss on this aspect.\n- at page 4 when defining x it is not clear which comorbidities are taken into account, those at the beginning of the longitudinal sample or those that have developed through time?\n- the assumption that all covariates are confounders or potential confounders is weak and averaging with respect to all covariates, expecially post-treatment covariates is a very bas practice that can greatly affect the performance to compare causal effect of different treatments.\n- formula (2) seems to implicitly assume independence between token, type, visit and physical, I think more comments are needed here to justify\n- m at the end of page 5 seems to indicate a different quantity tha what presented in previous pages, this make hard to understand the paper.\n- I miss the concept of \"causal treatment\", I know about treatment and causal effect of a treatment but I ignore what a \"causal treatment\" is, would you be that kind to explain?\n- apparently the paper states to be in the conditions to compute counterfactual, this is theoretically impossible unless you provide a theoretical proof of what you state. It is clear I could have missinterpreted what you wrote and if this is the case simply reply by clarifying that you did not intended to say that you can compute counterfactuals with your model. Eventually you can estimate counterfactural, provided a set of assumptions and that you show how this goal is achieved fro a theoretical point of view.\n- how to manage the fact that the study population is different from the target population? I think the paper must comment on this fundamental issue\n- the results are not discussed in a clear manner and thus not potential justitification or explanation are given to help the interested reader to appreciate the paper\n- I read \"interaction among input covariates\" but I miss what you mean by this, correlation? any other type of association? However, they are not enough to explain anything about the causal story behind the data\n- in formula (3) with respect to the fucntion f, you use the argument x while few lines before you used the argument e, thus I'm truly puzzled beacause x and e are defined as different quantities in a previous part of the paper.",

            "summary_of_the_review": "I found the paper to be not easy to read and how it is presented does not make it easy to appreciate the main contributions of the paper itself. The proposed framework, namely CURE, is definitely new, or at least I'm not aware of any other similar framework that has been presented in the specialized literature. However, the paper lacks in clarity and the presented case study has criticalities in terms of the fact that health care data suffer from missingness and several biases, while apparently the paper does not discuss in detail these fundamenatl aspects of the consider domain. Furthermore, also the notation is difficult to follow and in some cases it seem to be a mismatch, e.g. the argument of function f in formula (3). However, results of numerical experiments witness in favour of CURE when compared to state of the art approaches.",

On the one hand, I do not think the proposed method is particularly novel and I think the paper is missing a major chunk of literature on clinical risk prediction. On the other hand, I was very impressed by the experimental setup and comparison to real clinical trials, which I found very thoughtfully done. As this is a machine learning conference and I think the machine learning portion of the paper is lacking, I recommend a marginal rejection.\n\nMajor comments:\n1. Many, many papers have been written about clinical risk prediction using EHR data, including several that explicitly consider how to encode temporal information (e.g., Che et al. (2018)). I do not think the authors can make the claim that they have developed \"a new patient data encoding method to encode structured observational patient data and incorporate covariate type and time into patient embeddings.\" without reviewing this literature.\n\n2. I do not consider Section 3.1 to be a scientific contribution. These are the preprocessing steps that every EHR-based study must perform and I do not see anything particularly unique about the proposed steps. Please correct me if I have missed something.\n\n3. Notation in Section 2, specifically $y_1(x) - y_0(x)$ is not precisely defined.\n\n4. It is good that the authors mention causal identifiability assumptions in Section 2, but these assumptions cannot be made universally. Rather, for each causal analysis, the authors need to consider the various sources of confounding and censoring and make an argument that there are sufficient observed variables to account for potential biases. No such argument is made for the cases considered. \n\n5. In Section 5.2: 20 bootstrap samples is not enough to reliably estimate 95% confidence intervals. I recommend at least 100, but more would be better. Additionally, there are several ways estimate CIs from bootstrap samples. What method was used here?",
