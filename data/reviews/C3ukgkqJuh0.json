Instead of large amount of object-level supervision, the author formulate the instance segmentation as graph partitioning and predict the edge weights driven by the reward from object shape, position and size. Experiments on toy and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods with a good set of priors. \nOverall the proposed algorithm provides a new view regarding prior knowledge embedding, which enable well trained model with less annotated labels.

When dealing with limited samples, the reinforcement learning plays a key role and the author take the advantage of it.\n\n+The experiments is interesing and complete. They are conducted on both synthic and real images. \n\nWeakness:\n\n-The reason for utilizing the superpixel as the prior is not well explained. \n-The estimation to computatial cost and inference speed (e.g., FLOPs, FPS) are not presented in the experiments. \n\n-Comparisons to standard instance segmentation are missing. Although the algorithm has the advantage in limited samples, it doesn't provide enough avidence to demonstrate the compatitive scores when the training samples are adquated\n\n-Experiments on real dataset is too simple to indicates the potential ability. Authors should provide the results on more complicated medical images.",

See the weakness above. \nThere lack extensive experiments on public instance segmentation benchmark datasets,\nThe novelty is limited due to lacking the comparisons on more complicated medical dataset. \nThe experiments can hardly reproduced because the lacking of detials on superpixel graphs, which is the determine factor to the algorithm.  \n",

It follows the standard RL framework and take the object shape, position and size as the prior. By assigning the reward for each actor, the optimal instance score is obtained. \nOverall the paper is well origanized but the experiments are not adquate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

However, it is a little weird to add reinforcement learning here. Additionally, the authors claim that there is no state transition.
