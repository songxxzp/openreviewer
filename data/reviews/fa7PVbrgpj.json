And it illustrates the possible malicious byzantine attacks that prior works cannot handle. Their protocol is clearly presented.\n\nWeakness:\n- The intuition behind the construction is not well presented. Especially the reward/penalize part. \n- A big portion of technical novelty may go to the flip-score proposed by Sharma et al. (2021).\n- They assume that their way of using flip-score should trim out the anomalies. This does not look straight to me. Neither does the later convergence analysis. It deserves a better explanation or formal proof.\n\nOther thing:\n- Running title says for ICLR 2022.",

This paper proposes P2PRISM, a novel secure aggregation protocol for Byzantine-tolerant P2PL.\n3. Theoretical analysis for the convergence of P2PRISM is provided.\n4. Empirical results show the the proposed method outperforms the basline\n\nWeakness:\n1. I would recommend using larger CV datasets such as cifar-10 instead of mnist, but it is not a bug issue.\n2. The general idea of using using local updates for validation and Byzantine tolerance is actually not that novel. For example, the following 2 papers (zeno/zeno++ for short):\nXie, C., Koyejo, O., & Gupta, I. (2019). Zeno: Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent with Suspicion-based Fault-tolerance. ICML. https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/xie19b.html\nXie, C., Koyejo, O., & Gupta, I. (2020). Zeno++: Robust Fully Asynchronous SGD. ICML.  https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/xie20c.html\nEspecially for zeno++, it uses the inner-product between the update on the validation server and the candidate update to calculate a score for Byzantine tolerance, which sounds very similar to the general idea of P2PRISM, though the formula of the scores are different.\nAlthough zeno/zeno++ are originally for centralized learning, I think it's trivial to apply them to P2PL. Basically you just need to treat each worker as a server that uses the local training data to compute the validation score for zeno/zeno++.\nI think that zeno/zeno++ should be a better baseline compared to trimmed mean, since zeno/zeno++ are the techniques closet to P2PRISM.\nI highly recommend to at least give a detailed discussion about zeno/zeno++ in this paper. Experiments using modified zeno/zeno++ in P2PL as the baselines are also recommended.",
