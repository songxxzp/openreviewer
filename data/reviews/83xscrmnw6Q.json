            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors formulate the task of new drug recommendation as a few-shot learning task and propose a framework to solve it. They first utilize the drug ontology to learn the drug representation. Then they represent each patient as a set of phenotype vectors. Given a new drug, they make recommendations by measuring the similarity between representations of query patients and corresponding prototypes. They further introduce a knowledge-guided negative sampling strategy to eliminate false-negative effect.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1.\tProposing a new and meaningful task of new drug recommendation.\n2.\tModeling the task as a few-shot classification problem which is reasonable. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The application scenario is not clear. The designed experiment to answer the following question: given a new drug, which patient would take it? While in clinical application, it's hard to recommend a set of proper drugs for a specific patient -- it may take too much time to check all drugs one by one as the proposed model only take one drug as input.\n\n2. It's not clear that, considering EDGE lacks patients' history and the few-shot learning setting, can EDGE perform well on \"old\" drugs compared with baselines such SafeDrug? If not, how to merge this new drug rec model with traditional \"old\" drug rec model to obtain a complete drug list is also a problem.\n\n3. \"Analysis on False Negatives\" in sec. 4.3 seems not reasonable, as there exist lots of drug-drug interaction and drug-disease interaction. Adjusting the metrics according to MEDI without considering DDI doesn't make sense.\n\n4. The proposed solution is composed four existing modules, which lowers the technical novelty of the work. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: Some details about model design and experiment setting are not clear enough, making the paper less clear. E.g., why only one negative sample is enough in prototypical network? How drug recommendation model in baselines are trained and fine-tuned? It's also suggested to provide more data statistical information to make the model design and experiment result easier to be understood, e.g., how many diseases and procedures a patient has on average?\n\nQuality: This paper reads well. The proposed model is reasonable and the experiments are designed properly to demonstrate the effectiveness of EDGE to recommend new drugs. Ablation study is conducted to evaluate the contribution of each component.\n\nNovelty: This paper proposes a new task, while the proposed method is not novel enough. The encoding module 'Ontology-enhanced drug representation' and 'bi-GRU' have been proposed in previous work about drug recommendation as mentioned in the paper, and prototypical network has also been applied in recommendation systems [Sankar et.al., 2021].\n\nReproducibility: The proposed EDGE is reproduced as the model and data process method is clear. While the setting of baselines needs to be detailed as mentioned above.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes the use of few-shot learning together with the use of medical ontologies under the prototypical network architecture for new drug recommendation. The use of few-shot learning and ontologies is motivated by the fact that data related to new drugs is limited. Several tricks are suggested, including the use of ontological representation computed using Clinical-Bert and ontology, phenotype representation based on CCS, allowing the phenotype-based representation to be drug-dependent, as well as using ontology to obtain negative samples for training the prototypical network for handling the false-negative drug issue. They tried to compare with a number of benchmark methods and reported improvement on accuracy for new drug recommendation.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ The problem formulation is clearly presented in general. \n+ The use of ontological approach to deal with the cases with a small dataset is a reasonable one. Also the way they make use of the ontology is proper and reasonable. E.g., using the knowledge for the negative sampling to handle the false-negative cases is a smart one.\n+ Introducing the phenotypes can support interpretability of the model inferred as presented in the paper.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- While the problem seems interesting, it is not clear if the proposition of recommending new drugs based on only the support of a few patient record is a valid one or not. From the safety perspective, should drug be more carefully evaluated before it should be recommended? This seems to make it different from other recommendation tasks. This issue is not much discussed in the paper. This weakens the motivation of the problem and then the importance of the proposed techniques.\n- The main novelty is more on the way of integrating existing methods, and less on fundamental ones.\n- Only diagnosis and procedures are extracted to define the phenotypes. Works on computational phenotyping often include lab tests results. Should they be included as well? If not, what are the reasons? Related consideration is not presented in the paper.\n- Regarding presentation, the organization is generally ok and the writing can be further improved. For example, while I agree that the adoption of phenotype-based representation is good, related justification is not clearly presented. A bit more details regarding how to extract phenotypes from CCS will be useful.",

It just demonstrated better performance by using bi-directional GRG from the experiment.\n\nW2: The proposed model does not consider patients' historical EHR data.
