Previous work many focus on limited settings (i.e., p<1), while this paper proposes a universal mechanism which works for any symmetric norms with low space complexity. This idea for coordinate parathion to my knowledge is novel and very interesting. \n\nI have a hard time reading this paper. I think the following advices may be helpful:\n\n1.\tA more clear and detailed definition of the streaming model. Currently, it is not very clear to the readers what the exact streaming model is. The authors only mentioned the model with one sentence (\u201cThe simplest streaming model is perhaps the insertion-only model,\u2026\u201d). Is this the only model the authors study, or the model can be more general? \n\n2.\tThe preliminary should be put before Section 2, since many definitions of Section 3 are used in Section 2. \n\n3.\tIt would be great if the authors can add a related work section to compare with other work (especially smith et al., 2020, wang et al., 2021, blocki et al., 2012) and illustrate the differences. \n\n4.\t\u201cWe emphasize that prior to our work, there is no algorithm that can handle private symmetric norm estimation\u201dI am not sure if it is an overclaim, since previous can handle the cases when p<1.\n",
