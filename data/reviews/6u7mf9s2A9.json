            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes two training schemas for fostering interpretability in Geometric Deep Learning by considering two properties: the relevance of a point presence and the relevance of a point location. A backbone classifier network is trained in an adversarial way where an Interpreter modifies the input data with a given amount of point-wise noise (either by removing points or perturbing their position). Then, the classifier module tries to improve the score by removing the noise while the Interpreter attempts to redistribute the amount of noise. In the end, the noise should be located at non-relevant points, while important points are kept unchanged. The method is tested across four different datasets from physic and chemistry, outperforming baselines in most cases.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "STRENGHT\n=========\nS1) NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE: While similar principles have been proposed in the past to study neural network interpretability (on graphs: Miao et al. 2022; on images: \"U-noise: Learnable Noise Masks For Interpretable Image Segmentation\", Koker et al., 2021), I am not aware of similar approaches in the field of 3D point clouds. The formulation looks straightforward and applicable also in contexts outside the datasets proposed in the paper. Improving interpretability in Geometric Deep learning is an active research field, and I believe the proposed methods might have a relevant impact.\n\nS2) EXPERIMENTS: The two approaches are carefully tested with different backbones networks on several datasets, and also provide ablation and explanations of hyperparameter choices. \n\nWEAKNESSES\n========\nW1) LIMITATIONS AND DISCUSSION: The paper does not offer an overview of methods limitations, nor discussion or visualization of the achieved interoperability for the different tasks. Some sentences are spread across the text, pointing to how to exploit the covariance matrix to obtain fine-grained geometric patterns, but without showing examples. Clarify the interpretability analysis and clearly stating the outcomes could strengthen the paper message.\n\nW2) GEOMETRICAL DIVERSITY OF THE DATASETS: The proposed datasets present similar characteristics. The number of points for each sample is similar (between 15 and 340), with a similar proportion of importance points (between 20% and 30% of the entire point cloud) and the same number of classes (2 for all the datasets). It is also not clear if the different datasets face different points distribution (i.e., the density of the point clouds). I would suggest testing on data from different domains, coming from Computer Vision and Graphics (e.g., LiDAR, body scans, ShapeNet rigid objects), and also providing a measure about the density of the points w.r.t. the occupied space. \n\n\nMINOR\n=======\nM1) Can LBI-Bernoulli and LBI-Gaussian be trained together? Does it introduce instability in training? I think that if no technical limitations exist, it would be an interesting validation.\nM2) I think the methods can potentially work also on other domains (e.g., images, graphs), up to a minor reformulation of the two strategies. Is it correct? In that case, it might be mentioned as possible future work.",

Although the proposed methods, namely LRI-Bernoulli and LRI-Gaussian, are technically sound, it is hard to tell the technical contributions compared with existing works. For instance, PointMark, BernMask (GNNExplainer), GradGeo (DeepLIFT) are intensionally selected for comparison. How are they related to the proposed methods? What are the key differences/improvements from the proposed methods and previous mask-based methods (e.g., PointMark)? \n\n- Computation overhead. Constructing KNN graphs is very time-consuming. The proposed LRI-Gaussian has to perform graph reconstruction after each round of perturbations. However, there is no discussion about computational cost either analytically or empirically.\n\n- Missing ablation study. Without ablation studies, it is hard to tell whether the prediction and interpretation gains result from more parameters and additional computations.\nThe authors claim that existing interpretation methods cannot handle irregular geometric data. However, there is limited evidence to show that the proposed methods can handle it. \nThe authors claim that most existing methods can only provide either the existence or location importance. However, is this really a significant problem? \nCan the proposed LRI-Bernoulli and LRI-Gaussian work together? \n\nMinor Issues:\n- The structures of g and f is unclear, how the f take points and 3D spatial coordinates to make predictions? \n- How is the $| \\Sigma_v|$ is used to rank the location importance?\n- How the eigenvectors of $| \\Sigma_v|$ is calculated?\n",

It is interesting to study using interpretable learning mechanisms for point cloud data, especially for proteins that often consist of hundreds of amino acids.\n2.

The paper is not well-organized, and also is not easy to read.  I would suggest moving the dataset introduction part to a later section, and could better prepare a full system overview to better illustrate how the full system work. \n2. According to Table 1, all 4 datasets seem to be not large-scale, and each dataset only has 2 classes.  I am not sure if that is sufficient for a classification benchmark.  The number of points in each sample seems to be not large either (i.e., the largest is 339.8), which should be much less than a normal visual point cloud scan (e.g., at least 1024 in ModelNet40).
