In addition, since it is based on stochastic methods for which guarantees have been given for other applications, this is a clear lack. Questions include: \nWhat type of sampling distributions are used, and can these be modified during search to improve the returned function?\n",

(3): the claim \"It has been demonstrated that the MCTS agent continuously gains knowledge\" needs a reference.\n\nNeed a more precise definition of  Recovery rate (Table 1). It is well understood that the recovered equations typically contain many more terms than the target equations, and this needs to be shown in the definition and results. Do you mean \"regeneration of the precise equation with no additional terms\"?\n\nA key missing factor in the paper (Algorithm 1) is the specification of the regularization terms.
