            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper tackles the problem of point cloud triangulation. The authors introduce a deep neural network to detect circumcenters from point patches, and then they extract triangles dual to the detected circumcenters to form a primiteive mesh. The proposed method can reconstruct meshes within a couple of seconds, and poses no restriction on the surface topology. Evaluation in terms of quality, efficiency, and robustness has been carried out on 4 prominent datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n+ The formulation of the problem as circumcenter detection sounds novel in deep learning based point cloud triangulation.\n+ The formulation of the problem as circumcenter detection is technically sound.\n+ The proposed method does not require exhaustive enumeration of traingle combinations or local surface parameterization, which are computationally expensive procedures.\n+ The proposed method does not require any surface normal information, which are typically not available for a point cloud.\n+ The proposed method is a single-stage pipeline and has high efficiency compared to exsiting two-stage pipelines.\n+ The proposed method has achieved SOTA results in term of quality in the ABC dataset and MGN dataset, and highly competitive results in the FAUST dataset.\n+ The proposed method has achieved SOTA results in term of efficieny among deep learning based methods.\n+ The proposed method is robust to noisy and non-unifrom data.\n+ The proposed method works for both water-tight and open meshes.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The anchor based detection approach is not novel but borrowed from existing object detection networks. Novelty is limited in this technical aspect.\n- There is no evaluation on the effect of K (in KNN patch composition) and s (in detecting multiple circumcenters in a single anchor cell).",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Overall, this paper is clearly written and easy to follow. The idea of reformulating the point cloud trianguation problem into a circumcenter detection problem in a deep learning setting is original. The quantitative and qualitative results reported in the paper are both convincing and promising. There are also sufficient details included in the paper to reproduce the results.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a method for point cloud triangulation by creating local per-point triangulations and then post-processing these local triangulations into a global point cloud triangulation. The first step is performed using a graph neural network and it is the main contribution of the paper. Specifically, the paper proposes to predict the presence and the location of the circumcenters of the triangles around each point using a graph neural network. The paper further proposes to discretize the space around each point into predefined anchor cell and predict the circumcenters inside these anchor cells.   ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n* The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n* The paper proposes a novel method to predict local per-point triangulation of a point cloud with a graph neural network.\n\nWeaknesses\n* The proposed deep learning method only predicts local per-point triangulation (1-ring neighborhood). Even this steps does not provide any guarantees of the validity or quality of the local triangulation - e.g. can the triangles overlaps? Some experiments and metrics need to be added to illustrate and validate this step.\n* The main weakness of the proposed method is the fact that it does not discuss in any detail how these per-point triangulations are post-processed into a valid (e.g. non-overlapping triangles) and useable (e.g. for rendering) triangulation of the whole point cloud. Since nothing in the network design constraints neighboring points to have consistent triangulations after the inference, the postprocessing step seems to be essential to fix the inconsistencies. The paper also does not provide any metrics and almost no visualizations to illustrate the validity and useability of the reconstructed meshes. In addition, it is mentioned in the paper that a C implementation of the postprocessing is provided, however it does not appear in the attached code submission. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is mostly clearly written and easy to follow. Most of the detail necessary to reproduce the paper seems to appear in the main text or the supplementary material. The attached code includes the network implementation and validation code - however it does not include the code for training the network, or the code for post-processing the network output (local per-point triangulations) into a global triangulation.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "* The attached code does not include the code for training the model, or for post-processing the network output (local per-point triangulations) into a global triangulation.\n\n* Not all parameter choices are explained - e.g. how is M chosen (Sec. 3.1).\n\n* In section 3.1 and Figure 4: what constraints the network to produce valid local triangulations? E.g. that the triangles in this 1-ring neighborhood of a point are non-overlapping. Provide some quantitative experiments.\n\n* I suggest to move Eq. (7) and the preceding sentence starting with \"The proposed network detects each circumcenter\" to section 3.2, to explain how anchors are used to predict circumcenters. Also, use \u201chat\u201d above \"g\"s in Eq. (7) to specify that these are offsets from predicted circumcenters, not from the ground truth ones.\n\n* At the end of Section 3.5, the paper states \"Since the primitive mesh is produced regardless of topological constraint, we apply post-processing to make it edge-manifold and fill the small holes. For convenience, we provide C implementations with Python interface for the post-processing.\" This post-processing seems like a very important part of the proposed method. Since nothing constraints neighboring points to have consistent triangulations after the inference, the postprocessing step is essential to fix the inconsistencies and to produce consistent and useable point cloud triangulation. For such an important step, the two line explanation which does not contain any detail about the method is not sufficient. Also, as stated above, the code linked to the submission does not include the postprocessing code.\n\n* Evaluation criteria: Elaborate on why CD1, CD2, F1 are the right metrics here. E.g. what exactly does Chamfer distance measure here and how it is related to the quality of the triangulation. Add an evaluation metric measuring the quality of the constructed meshes in terms of how well they approximate 2D surfaces.\n\n* Figure 5:\n    * (a) Add visualization of a small parts of the mesh showing the quality of the triangulation. Render the resulting mesh to show the triangulation quality visually.\n    * (d) The triangulation seems to contain holes for non-uniformly sampled point cloud, contradicting the statement in the caption that the method is robust to variations in the point cloud density.\n    * The caption is very lengthy and can be improved by moving come explanations to the main text.\n\n",
