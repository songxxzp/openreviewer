Gallery features typically use a more expensive feature extractor, whereas the query features are extracted with a more lightweight feature extractor to increase the speed during inference. The authors first compute the ranked list using the gallery features, and  add a consistency loss term such that the same ordering will be preserved when using the query features. Two solutions are proposed for preserving the ranked list ordering between different sets of features. The experiments are thorough and show that the proposed method brings improvements.",

The rank preserving framework allows feature compatibility and order consistency between a query model and a gallery model simultaneously.

An evaluation of the proposed framework on 4 public datasets showed that that this framework outperforms significantly some state of the art methods.\n",

The proposed framework doesn't require a labeled dataset and optimizes directly the consistency of rank order between the query model and the gallery model.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The method addresses the problem of asymmetric image retrieval, in which different models are deployed for query and gallery - usally for computation efficiency reasons - and that consists on aligning their embedding spaces. The authors argue that current approaches, which try to enforce the consitency of features between models, are too limiting since this is too strict for lightweight query models with low capacity. To address this issue, instead of forcing the query model to produce the same representations as the gallery, the authors relax this problem and propose to optimize instead the consitency of the rank order. For this, they propose two methods that aim to achieve this rank consistency between two rank orders.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is well written and the method very well motivated by presenting a possible limitation of current methods (enforcing consistency of feature spaces) and proposing a direct solution to this problem by optimizing the consistency of the rank order instead, which by itself I think it is a very good idea. Then, figures and the explanation of their framework and methods are also very clear. Finally, experiments are extensive and includes a very useful ablation analysis.\n\nThere is however something that I would have liked to see in the paper, which is a deeper insight of the differences between the two methods for rank preserving proposed. For example, both methods are on par when using Sfm120K as training set but when using GLv2, MSP significantly outperforms ROP: why does this happen? Is there any scenario where one would choose ROP over MSP? It would have been interesting to see a deeper comparison between both methods.\n\nA couple of typos I spotted:\n- Page 3, last paragraph: we aims to learn -> we aim to learn\n- Page 4, first paragraph: images are token -> images are taken\n",

The method is also explained very clearly and it should be relativerly easy to reproduce, experiments incldued. Regarding the paper's contribution, I also think that their approach to solving this problem is novel.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Even though I think that a deeper analysis comparing the methods proposed would have made the paper more well-rounded, it is already a very strong paper with a very strong contribution presented with a very clear motivation. Other than this weakness just mentioned, the experimental analysis is also quite extensive. Taking all this into account, I would recommend this for its acceptance.",

Then, the asymmetric similarity scores are calculated using the features of the images from the ranking list and the features of the query image from the lightweight model. Finally, to ensure that the original ranking is preserved, two different techniques are proposed: Rank Order Preservation and Monotonic Similarity Preservation. The first technique optimizes the consistency of rank, while the second uses a learnable function to map the similarity scores of both models.",
