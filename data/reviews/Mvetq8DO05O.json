            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper introduces a new family of probability distributions on SO(3) called Rotation Laplace distributions. The literature has established how a matrix Fisher distribution on SO(3) approximates a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian distribution on the tangent space $T_{\\mathbf{R}_0}SO(3)$, where $\\mathbf{R}_0$ is the mode rotation of the distribution. Using exactly the same way, the paper shows how a Rotation Laplace distribution approximates a zero-mean multivariate Laplace distribution on the tangent space at the mode rotation.\n\nThe paper does not stop there. As each matrix Fisher distribution on SO(3) has an equivalent Bingham distribution on the unit quaternion space, a family of Quaternion Laplace distributions is introduced, members of which, proved in the same way, are equivalent to Rotation Laplace distributions.\n\nJust like matrix Fisher distributions, the proposed distributions suffer from having no analytical form for the normalization factor. In the paper, the authors relied on quantising SO(3) using Hopf fibration and pre-computing or approximating the normalization factor and their first-order derivatives at quantised points, in the same way as state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nExperiments on the ModelNet10-SO3 dataset and the Pascal3D+ dataset show results favouring the proposed distributions, over existing distributions on and representations of rotation matrices, in the problem of robust rotation regression.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strength\n\nThe motivation of the paper is clear. The results convincingly support the motivation. In Euclidean spaces, Laplace distributions, while less studied, have proven to be more robust than Gaussian distributions.  This paper leverages that idea from Euclidean spaces to SO(3). In this context, I find figure 2 very useful and straight to the point.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe section 4.3 that describes dense discrete approximation of the normalizing factor needs further elaborating. For example, given that this part is key for forward and backward passes, it would be critical to know how many points have been used to quantise SO(3) via the Hopf fibration. What kind of speed-accuracy tradeoff have you experienced? Obviously, if we go to rotation spaces higher than 3D, this quantisation approach is unlikely to work.\n\nGiven that the contribution is a distribution family, a rather general concept, it would be good to have applications other than just robust rotation regression.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The derivation of the Rotation Laplace distributions is somewhat straightforward, but clear, precise and original. One minor point is at the equation above (2), when you consider the 3D Laplace distribution. The density functions needs a clarification as to why it has collapsed into the fraction on the right hand side, as not many people are familiar with the modified Bessel function of the second kind. Another is that in definition 2 of section 4.1, the authors refer to the normalization factor as a constant F, when it actually depends on $\\Sigma$.\n\nI would encourage the authors to cite a classical paper about multivariate Laplace distribution rather than an evolving, unofficial Wikipedia page, one of which can be: \n\nKozubowski, Tomasz J.; Podgorski, Krzysztof; Rychlik, Igor (2010). \"Multivariate Generalize Laplace Distributions and Related Random Fields\" (PDF). University of Gothenburg. Retrieved 2017-05-28.\n\nOther than the missing pieces in section 4.3, I think the remaining materials are enough for proper reproduction of the results.",
