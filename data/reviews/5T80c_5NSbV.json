The combination of multiparameter persistency with persistent homology allows to catch complex features inside the data. The multiparameter is then crucial to deal with data with more than one dimension.\n2. The representation is robust (using geometric and stable parameters) so usable in context where noise may be important.\n3. There is an analysis of both the approximation quality of the feature and the convergence toward a complete representation of the data.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\nSuch framework have several weakness,\n1. High dimensional data are still an issue with such framework.\n2. The scope of such methods is unclear and should be discuss. ",

Both main ingredient exist, but some part rely on recent results.

The authors provide proof for their theorem (which I did not check for correctness).\n\n- The run time of the algorithm seems faster when compared to the run time of the used baseline algorithms as shown in Table 2.\n\n- The algorithm shows more than 10 % improvement on accuracy, when compared to MPL and Ripley. (However, more baseline algorithms could also be used there for a better judgment).\n\n\nWeaknesses: \n- The idea of using multiple parameters for geometric modeling and for filtering is not new, and there are other multiparameter based solutions exist in the literature. The authors can do a better taxonomy of those works from the literature by including them in their work and in their experiments (for example, the authors should also include the following 3 works as they also are highly related to this work: (i) O. Chapelle, V. Vapnik, O. Bousquet, and S. Mukherjee, \"Choosing multiple parameters for support vector machines\", Machine learning, 46(1-3):131\u2013159, 2002; and (ii) Ozer, S. (2018), \"Similarity domains machine for scale-invariant and sparse shape modeling\", IEEE Transactions on Image Processing, 28(2), 534-545; (iii) Witkin, Andrew P. \"Scale-space filtering.\" In Readings in Computer Vision, pp. 329-332. Morgan Kaufmann, 1987)\n\n- The paper uses heavy Math based representation, which is hard to follow. Furthermore, the proposed \"algorithm\" is not clear to understand. The structure of this paper could be improved by focusing the flow of the paper to explain the steps of the proposed approach first. Currently the proposed algorithm is given as Appendix and it is not citing the any particular equation from the main text. That could be simplified. \n\n- Experimental results show marjinal improvement on toy datasets and the approach is compared to k-NN classifier along with 3 additional random algorithms in Table 3.  The baseline algorithms seem limited. For classification, the authors could use many classification algorithms, when their performance metric is accuracy. \n\nIn Table 3, the caption states that \"classification results for time series\". It is not well explained how the time series problem is considered as a geometry based multi-scale classification problem there. That could be clarified.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: The paper is hard to read due to the heavy math and almost lack of words (I could not had time to read most of the presented Math to check their correctness). The paper should properly balance both math and text. At the beginning of this paper, the authors state that they present an approach for shape modeling, but then, they show some basic results on toy datasets selected from UCR. That does not make a well structured and a complete story to me. The authors can focus on matching the beginning of the paper (their initial motivation) and their presented approach with its results.\n\nQuality: It seems there is some novelty here but the way it is presented, makes it harder to value its significance. The experimental results seem basic, and the reported improved results seem marginal. None of those shows any significance. While there are many multiparametric algorithms out there, the authors choose to compare their technique to more basic approaches.\n\nNovelty: As I stated above, it seems that this paper has some novelty but the main ideas also seem to be borrowed from scale-space theory and from geometry based multi-parameter computing concepts. Both concepts are studied in the literature (see some sample works from the literature above). Consequently, the novelty of this work and its motivation could be emphasized in a more clear way. \n\nReproducibility: I am not sure how well the presented results could be replicated without the code. Seems like there are many handpicked parameters that are not fully described in Algorithm 1. The authors claim to release their code upon acceptance, however.\n\n\n",

The used ideas could be found in the literature. As such, the motivation and the novelty of this paper remains unclear to me.

For the real-world data, more basic comparisons with 1-parameter persistent homology as well as other relevant methods should be included.  \n    - The advantage over the existing multiparameter methods is not sufficiently explained, although it is somehow discussed.  One of the advantages should be stability.  In comparison with Carriere & Blumberg (2022),  the authors just cite Botnan & Lesnick (2018) without details.  As an important contribution, the reason for having stability, unlike the others, should be explained more clearly and demonstrated with some basic numerical examples.  \n- The significance of the theoretical analysis in Section 4.1 is unclear.  \n    - As discussed in the paper, the dependence of constant $\\delta$ is not clear enough.  While the authors say that the empirical results do not show bad behavior by choice of \\delta, more detailed discussions are necessary about whether this dependence on $\\delta$ appears as an artifact by the theoretical derivation or an inevitable factor by the method. \n    - In the upper bound (8), the bandwidth parameter $h$ remains constant, and the bound involves a constant factor.  Can we say that the first term $1/\\sqrt{n}$ is the convergence rate?  \n- Some parts of the paper are tough to understand for standard readers in the machine learning field.  Some examples are:\n    - In the last paragraph of page 3, \"indecomposable\" module is undefined. \n    - In Figure 1, it is not clearly explained what is depicted in the middle and right figures.  More explanations are needed. \n- The paper may not be easy to read for most researchers in the machine learning field.   While I understand the difficulty of explaining persistent homology to non-experts, the authors could demonstrate better the importance of the problem to be solved in this paper.
