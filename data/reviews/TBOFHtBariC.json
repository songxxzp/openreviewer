            "summary_of_the_paper": "This study focuses on the morphological symmetries in dynamical systems; for example, a bipedal robot is symmetric to the reflection. When applying data-driven method to such systems, the function is desired to have corresponding symmetries. To this end, this study uses the method proposed in ICML,2021 to build symmetric neural networks.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n\nThe problem setting is clear, and the proposal is a nice application of Finzi et al., ICML, 2021.\n\n**Weakness**\n\nNovelty and significance appear to be limited. Several studies have already investigated the symmetries in dynamical systems.\nEspecially, Finzi et al., ICML, 2021, on which the proposed method is based, already examined dynamical systems symmetric to continuous groups such as $O(2)$. Discrete symmetries have also examined in the references in Finzi et al., ICML, 2021. It is not clear what main difficulties were and how the proposed method resolved.\n\nThe morphological discrete symmetries in robots have also examined in Finzi et al., \"Residual Pathway Priors for Soft Equivariance Constraints\", NeurIPS, 2021, which is not cited in the present manuscript.\n\nAlso, the differences from previous studies (especially, Weissenbacher et al., 2022) are still unclear. Please introduce Limitations in the Appendix in more detail.\n\n\nIn Section3, the definition and expression about the velocity contain several abuses of notions. $TQ$ is often used to represent a tangent bundle (the space of the pair of position and velocity). $T_qQ$ is the notion for a tangent space (the space of the velocity) at point $q\\in Q$. The map $\\dot g$ accepts $q$ as an argument, but if so, its domain should be $Q$, not $TQ$. Nothing can map a tangent vector $\\dot q$ independently from the position $q$. The map should be the pushforward by $g$ at the position $q$ and can be denoted by (but not limited to) $g^*_q$.\n\n",

DBS can not be applicable to many dynamics, which is mentioned also in \"Imitating reflections of space requires symmetric rigid bodies and/or modularity\"\n3. DBS requires significant domain knowledge (when and how to mimic the original symmetry). there is no general principle how to calculate it in an arbitrary dynamics. it is not unique, as there can be multiple reconfigurations mimicking the original symmetry. \n4. the experiments are limited to supervised learning, even though the author method in the text uncontrollable and consolable trajectories, which alluded there would be application to control problems. \n\n\n\n\n\nsmall comments:\ntypos: \"Kinematic three\",\" an angle $\\theta$ unfeasible\".
