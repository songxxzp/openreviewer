Rather than proposing a GNN that can learn link heuristics, the authors simply embed the results of link heuristics and leverage them for link prediction by concatenating with representations produced by GNNs.\n\n- Insufficient explanation of the proposed method. The author mentioned that embeddings of each heuristic method (SPD, CN, and RA) are fed into ComHG as inputs, but there is no specific explanation of how each method is embedded.\n\n- The performance of GNN only in the ablation study (Fig 5.) and the performance of baselines using only GNNs (e.g., GCN, GraphSAGE, JKNet, GAT) are inconsistent.

            "summary_of_the_review": "I elaborate the strengths and weaknesses here:\n\nStrengths\n+ The background setting is established well for the importance of Link Prediction and its wide applications.  The authors have performed experiments on large datasets (typically Order of millions in nodes) and they have showcased empirically the comparative performance of their proposed methods w.r.t GNN based Link heuristic methods (like SOTA - SEAL), GNN based methods (SOTA - GraphSage).\n+ The ablation study at the end of the effect of link heuristics and GNN modules in the proposed method is well investigated and clearly shows how sparsity of the graph effects each of the components contribution. The authors provide a strong reasoning behind this phenomenon and its empirically showcased.\n+ Model complexity wise the author theoretically shows how their proposed method has less complexity than SOTA SEAL method.\n\n\nWeakness:\n\n-  Missing important baselines https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04375, https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08974\n\n- The question raised in the introduction part is valid but the authors do not clearly convey what methods like SEAL fail to capture which traditional link based heuristics capture. That information could setup a more strong motivational setting for the rest of the paper to follow . Why is it important to capture link based heuristics ? Does it show significant improvement than GNNs which fail to capture such info. If so any empirical reference or short writing as to why it is so. \n\n- The author mentions that through experimental results they are able to show the gap why link based heuristics are important for LP. It would have been nice to showcase the gap also theoretically. In link heuristics only a few classical methods are mentioned while other important link based heuristics like simrank / simrank* and it's variations are not mentioned. \n\n- The generalization into the set structure is a bit unconvincing like in typical simrank computations which takes into account recursiveness of its computation for all its neighbours. The fixed one hop is only assumed. Also the definition for setop nullifies there. \n\n- Proposition I. states that GNNs doent take into account the attenetion for a particular node or pairwise. However, models like GAT have been proposed to take that into account. What if GNNs that take into account edge reperesnetations like NBFNet ( although here it's mentioned for only node level representationsl) then do we require such heuristics any more ? What if we had hybrid of NBFNet edge emebeddings along with traditional node representation based GNNs. Does that solve the problem? Did the authors perform experiments on those? \n\n- Proposition I  is not convincing.  Do the authors share any examples where the pooling information over elements in one set don't contribute? A pooling information over a set of neighborhoods of a particular node will also have the inherent pooling information of the individual neighborhood nodes via message passing. Does that information. Not similar in essence to link Prediction tasks. If not can it theoretically be shown or via suitable examples. \n\n- Proposition II also lacks the same mathematical rigour and explanation as to why combine operation doesn't capture the same info as compared to a set intersection. \n\n- Proposition III is well explained via an example. However we can use weighted attentetion or weighted mean in the pooling strategy or other pooling strategies can also be used to countereffect the loss in information. Only SEAL GNN based LP was analysed. But not any other GNN based LP. For the propositions to hold it needs to be shown for all GNN based LPs and should be mathematically motivated as to which information gets missed if we have a clever pooling strategy. Also empirical results should be cited in those propositions stating whether SEAL based LP performs poorly for certain examples. \n\n- Does combHGs heuristic embedding not lose information since it basically a concatenation of node embeddings and as per previous propositions it should lose some information. The node embeddings might change later on due to the GNN pooling. It's not clear. \n\n- As per table 2 if GNN based LP produces better than traditional LPs then it contradicts the proposition that GN based LP fail to capture those heuristics which is a fundamental notion of this paper ( why such heuristics are important).\n\n- I think Hits are not so crucial metric in the context of LP, it does not capture the recall. MAP is better.\n",
