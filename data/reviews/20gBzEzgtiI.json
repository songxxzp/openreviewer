The authors introduced some assumptions on the model/policy Lipschitz continuty and established the Lipschitz continuty property of (optimal) value functions in HiP-MDPs. In Sec. 4 & 5, they derived the upper bound when transferring the optimal policy in learned Lipschitz model and pretrained Lipschitz optimal joint policy, repsectively. Finally, in Sec. 6, they conducted some evaluation experiments to verify the theoretical finding.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strength\n\nThe Lipschitz continuty assumptions about the model/policy are reasonable, from theoretical perspective. It's also good to see the theoretical results are verified by empirical evaluation in Sec. 6.\n\n### Weakness\n\nSince the experiment part is just some evaluation about the theoretical results, instead of proposing some novel and effective empirical algorithms inspired from theory, I would believe the novelty of theory part is what to be evaluated the most.\n\nHowever, it seems to me the theory part is not significant enough, and the results, although somewhat new, are kind of trivial and not surprising. Theoretical results about value difference bounds w.r.t. Lipschitz constants had been established in previous works (e.g. [1]), and the authors main contributions seems just analyzed the extended setting called HiP-MDPs, where the model/reward functions will take an additional ``hidden parameter'' $\\theta$ as input which capturing the variation across different models. I found the techniques are similar and there is not much novelty.\n\nBesides, the theory also has some restriction in practice. Although similar assumptions occurs in previous papers, the requirement that $\\gamma$ times (combination of) Lipschitz constants is less than 1 occurs in almost all the main theorems (seems because of the $1-\\gamma K$ occurs in the denominator). However, in practice, it is hard to verify whether such condition holds, or give any prediction about what will happen if such conditions do not hold. I think the authors should provide at least some examples about when such assumptions can be true in practice.\n\n\n[1] DeepMDP: Learning Continuous Latent Space Models for Representation Learning.

The main contribution of this paper is the theoretical analysis on the regret upper bounds of model and policy transfer algorithms, as well as multi-step prediction error. These bounds are proven to be tight in linear deterministic settings. The theoretical analysis in this paper provides insights on the performance of model/policy transfer algorithms and its connection with Lipschitz constants.\n",

Thus, it provides practical perspectives on choosing between model or policy transfer methods. For example, policy transfer is likely to outperform model transfer in the sense of robustness when the differences between actions are small. On the other hand, model transfer is likely to outperform policy transfer in terms of robustness when the different between neighboring states are small. Empirical results further validates the theoretical findings.\n\nThe main weaknesses of this work are listed as follows:\n- It is unclear how the analysis presented in this work is related with previous theories. In many places the authors have mentioned that their results share similarity with some of the previous results, for example Theorem 3.1 is a generalization of theorems in a bunch of papers, similar paradigm of the algorithm framework has been widely used in complex continuous control tasks. The authors emphasis the major significance of their work, but it seems that it fails to provide a more detailed comparison on how much it improves upon previous results on HiP-MDPs.\n- There is little intuition on how the results are derived, a brief outline of proof on at least one of the main theorems would help readers to better understand the technical novelty of this work.",
