            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a method, called transcendental idealism of planner (TIP), to evaluate the end-to-end performance of a perception model in terms of how it affects AV planning. The authors formulate the planning of an autonomous vehicle as an expected utility maximization (EUM) problem. They further show that the objective function can be represented as an inner product between the world state description and the utility function in a Hilbert space, from which they derive the TIP metric.\n\nThe authors compared their proposed TIP metric against the traditional perception metrics, including NDS and PKL, on both synthetic and real datasets. They had the human labelers label the scenarios where the two metrics disagree, and the result shows that their TIP metric better captures the severity of perception errors.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "--- Strengths\n\n- Evaluating the end-to-end perception performance in terms how it affects AV planning has significant practical value. The proposed method is shown to better capture the severity of perception errors compared to the existing methods.\n\n- The paper also provides theoretical reasoning for their proposed method in addition to the empirical results.\n\n\n--- Weaknesses\n\n- It is not clear whether this metric is generic to different planner architectures.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new method to evaluate the perception results in autonomous vehicles based on its influences on the following planning module. With theoretical guarantees, the impact of the perception error can be decomposed into two orthogonal complements that are planning-critical and planning-invariant. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed evaluation method.\n\n\n\n----\n_Post-rebuttal_:\nThanks for the response.\nIt is glad to see the detail of Q1 and the updated contents in RS.\nFor Q2 and Q3, the authors have provided more explanations and discussions while admitting what is (and is not) included in the current work, which is OK to the reviewer.\nTherefore, the reviewer keeps the original positive score (6).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "###### Pros\n- The topic of evaluating perceptions from the planning perspective is new and in great demand.\n- The proposed method is well theoretically supported, and its implementation is not complicated.\n- Adequate comparisons and case studies to other evaluation methods are provided, which fully demonstrate the proposed method's merits.\n\n###### Cons\n- It seems that the definition of the utility function is critical for this evaluation. The authors could discuss more how the choice and the computation of utility functions affect the usage of this evaluation method.\n- This method assumes the action set is finite, which may not be satisfied by all planners.\n- The definition in Eq. (13) takes the maximum reduction considering all actions. This is the worst-case analysis and is essential for AV, but would it be too conservative (so that the evaluation results may be too far from that of the final chosen action) in practice?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- The writing is fluent. The contents are relatively difficult to follow for people unfamiliar with related works.\n- There is no released code, but enough implementation and design details are provided.\n\n###### Misc.\n- Most figures (especially Fig.1 and Fig. 2) are not black&white-friendly.\n- The footnote on page 5 should be on page 4.\n- On page 2, for the sentence \"or even negative in many common cases\", Fig. 1 should show at least one example with negative correlations.\n- While Section 2 claims the proposed evaluation only works for model-based planning methods rather than data-driven ones, it would be more accurate to say it works for module-based planning rather than end-to-end ones.",

This is an important topic and starts to receive increasing attention in recent years, yet still underexplored. Specifically, the paper proposes to formulate the expected utility maximization objective as an Hilbert inner product between the world state and the utility function. \n\nThe proposed approach is evaluated using synthetic and real data. Results show that the proposed method demonstrates higher sensitivity to perception noise, compared to PKL and NDS. \n",

Results show that the proposed method has higher sensitivity in detecting perception noise, compared to PKL and NDS.\n\nWeakness:\n1. It is unclear to me how different methods\u2019 scores are calibrated. Therefore, the proposed method might be just analyzed in the scale it is designed for. Moreover, should we calibrate the same scoring system across different evaluation scenarios? For the proposed TIP, what does a score evaluated from scenario A indicate when compared to a lower score evaluated from scenario B? \n2. The proposed TIP is for evaluating perception quality but the paper only shows results of added perception noise to one particular detector. I would like to see how TIP evaluates and compares different object detectors. \n3. As shown in Figure 4, the proposed TIP does not yield a monotonic score with respect to the distance. Will this cause confusion in practice? \n4. The paper fails to compare with SDE (Deng et al) quantitatively. \n",
