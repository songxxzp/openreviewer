            "summary_of_the_paper": "The manuscript describes a Transformer-based neural network aimed at predicting the energies and the forces of molecules. The network is trained on the prediction of the energy of ~130,000 small molecules. The loss includes the square deviation between the ground truth energy and the predicted energy, and also terms aimed at ensuring that the \"experimental\" structures are stable.  The energy estimator includes, beside the transformer, a  two-body energy, eq 5. The model predicts the energy with an accuracy which is marginally worse than that of other approaches, but it allows recovering the correct structure in geometry optimizations started from perturbed configurations.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1) the idea of training  a network using a BERT-style censoring of the position of some atoms is, to my knowledge, original.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1) the challenge in the field is reproducing the forces (and the energies) along a *reaction pathway*, namely for sequences of configurations connecting two different molecular species, or two different configurations of the same molecule. The forces along these pathways are typically very high, and determine the chemistry of the system.  The test set used in this work is therefore mostly of academic interest: the forcefield developed in this work is good for reproducing the geometry of the molecules, but worse than other approaches in reproducing the energy difference between molecules. No relevant \"activated\" geometry is included in the test set. \n2) the idea of fitting the forces, and not only the energy, dates back to the 90ties (see wiki, \"force matching\") and is  used almost ubiquitously also in NN training (see, for example, https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00913 eq 9). The fact that by adding a penalty on the value of the forces allows recovering the correct  geometry is correct, but trivial, since the configurations explored in these optimization are very similar to the global minimum. The relevant result would be reproducing the forces along a reaction pathway (see point 1).\n3) The idea of adding explicitly LJ or Coulomb interactions in a NN is also not new, but, more importantly, adding these terms for isolated and very small molecules is not chemically justified. In fact these terms are typically added to describe liquid environments (see for example https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20427-2 ), where different molecules interact by non-bonded interactions.

Some of the directions which are explored , for example the BERT-style masking loss, are interesting and could bring to important advances.",

Also, all experiments are conducted on the same dataset for one task. It is questionable how such learned representations can be used for other datasets/tasks.\n2. The ablation study is not clear.

Compared to other baseline models, their full model preforms much better on force prediction, while the energy MAE is slightly lagging behind the state-of-the art MXMNet model. When applying to the structure optimization task, the full model outperforms the other base line models, which demonstrates that the physical-driven model captures the basic physical information instead of simply over-optimizing on the energy estimation. Besides, inspired by the Masked Language Modeling, the authors proposed Masked Atomic Modeling to help the model to discover chemical restrictions.",

I'm interested to know why the result in Table 1 shows that the force prediction is more accurate yet the energy prediction is not. I wonder if the LJP model gives too much constraint on the energy prediction and affects performance. \n2. The experiments are not complete enough: \n  - Only performance on QM9 is shown, which is ok since its the standard benchmark in this field. Other datasets (e.g. OC20 ) could also be used as QM9 is often criticized for its non-equilibrium structures of molecules. \n  - Strong baselines are missing.
