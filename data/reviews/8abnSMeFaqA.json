The proposed algorithm can be intuitively seen as an extension of the standard GDA algorithm where the update of each player has an additional term that makes use of second-order information. In particular, it seems like a natural extension of the FTR algorithm of [Wang, Zhang, Ba, ICLR 2019]. Having read the appendix, my main concern has to do with the technical novelty and challenges behind the main result. My concerns focus specifically on two aspects: (i) the algorithm is heavily similar to the FTR algorithm of [WZB '19] and (ii) the technical challenges (provided Assumption 2) are mainly algebraic manipulations of the double-FTR dynamics.\n\nI would like to pose the following questions:\n\nQ1. Can the authors highlight the technical novelties and challenges behind the result? Adding a technical overview section in the main body would be helpful. \n\nQ2. Assumption 2 ensures that the updates in lines 2 and 3 of Algorithm 1 do not vanish. Is it possible to drop this assumption or relax it by extending the proposed algorithm?  \n\nQ3. Is it known whether second-order information is truly necessary in order to obtain a result like Theorem 1? As discussed in Section 2, standard GDA fails to converge even in zero-sum games. It would be beneficial to add a more extensive discussion regarding other first-order methods.\n\nIn general, I believe that the paper is nice and well-written. However, I think that the technical contribution of the paper is limited. Nevertheless, I am willing to increase my score after authors' rebuttal depending on the response.\n",

I will justify this with the comments that I present below.\n\n  1. If we assume that there exists a Differential Nash Equilibrium according to Definition 2.1 and we also assume Assumption 1 then, unless I am missing something, f is convex with respect to x and g is concave with respect to y everywhere.\n  Proof sketch: Let $z^* = (x^*, y^*)$ be a Differential Nash Equilibrium according to Definition 2.1. Assume also that there exist a point $z_0 = (x_0, y_0)$ such that $f$ is not convex with respect to $x$ at $z_0$. This means that $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(z_0)$ has a negative eigenvalue. Consider now the line segment $L$ that connects $z^*$ and $z_0$. We know that the eigenvalues of $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(z^*)$ are all positive and that $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(z)$ is a continuous function of $z$ according to Assumption 1. It is also well-known that the eigenvalues are continuous functions of the matrices. Hence, the minimum eigenvalue of $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(z)$ goes from positive at $z = z^*$ to negative at $z = z_0$ in a continuous way. Since $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(z)$ is symmetric all the eigenvalues are real and hence there should be a point $\\bar{z} \\in L$ such that the minimum eigenvalue of $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(\\bar{z})$ is zero which means that $\\nabla^2_{x x} f(\\bar{z})$ is not invertible which violates Assumption 1. Therefore, f is convex with respect to x and similarly g is concave with respect to y. Am I missing something here?\n  Given the above, it is not an achievement of the proposed algorithm that is it stable only around stationary points that are second-order Nash because only such stationary points exist. So the main motivation of the paper is not correct.\n\n  2. The achievement of the proposed algorithm though is that it is stable around all the simultaneous stationary points of f with respect to x and g with respect to y. This to my knowledge is a not trivial property even when we assume that f is convex with respect to x and g is concave with respect to y. The reason that this is interesting is that this is applied in a general-sum setting. Finding such simultaneous stationary points is as difficult as finding fixed points of any continuous map!\n  Proof sketch: Let $H : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a continuous map and let $f(x, y) = \\|x - H(y)\\|^2$ and $g(x, y) = - \\|x - y\\|^2$. Then it is easy to see that all the simultaneous stationary points of f with respect to x and g with respect to y, correspond exactly to the fixed points of $H$.\n  Finding fixed points of continuous maps is more general that finding solutions of general non-monotone variational inequalities, which is more general than multi-agent general-sum concave games which have a ton of applications in game theory and economics. So the fact that the proposed algorithm is locally asymptotically stable only on those points is an interesting property. Nevertheless, it should be compared to the known results from the variational inequalities community or the computation of fixed points community which is missing from the current version of the paper.",
