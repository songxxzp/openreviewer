I have the following concerns, but most are relatively minor and I recommend acceptance.\n\nAbstract:\n\n1. In partial compliance settings, treatment assignment (not compliance) is used as the IV for actual drug usage.\n\n2. I recommend being more specific \"asymptotically outperforms.\"\n\nSection 1:\n\n1. I recommend replacing the term \"Individual treatment effect\" with \"Conditional average treatment effect since \"individual treatment effect\" is used to mean something different in much of the causal inference literature.\n\n2. help in potentially --> helps in making potentially\n\n3. , --> .\n\n4. Race and gender are standard parts of intake forms and are both typically stored in medical records.\n\n5. \"Our framework...\": I found these two sentences hard to follow. I would focus on giving intuition here rather than jargon. For example, the meaning of \"multiply robust\" depends on the context. You should give intuition for what it is robust to why that is important.\n\n6. Registering for Medicaid should not be referred to as \"compliance\" even if the statistical model is the same as a partial compliance model. There is no mandate that someone needs to register if eligible. \n\n7. Assumption 2 is a *major* assumption that requires more discussion than it is given here. For example, if $U$ includes socioeconomic status, as suggested by the authors then this assumption implies that SES cannot moderate the treatment effect. \n\nSection 2:\n\n1. In Assumption 4: do these conditions need to hold everywhere on $\\mathcal{X}$ or is it sufficient for them to hold almost everywhere w.r.t. $P(X)$?\n\n2. Need to explicitly define $r_\\tau(n)$ or at least give intuition.\n\nSection 5:\n\n1. \"One explanation...\": I would refrain from making this hypothesis without including explicit citations to back up the underlying theoretical model.",

If $\\hat{\\mu}^Y_0$ refers to an estimator of $\\mu^Y_0$, $\\hat{\\mu}^Y_0$ should have some estimation error, and therefore it is impossible that $\\hat{\\mu}^Y_0= \\mu^Y_0$.

The authors, building on existing approaches, show what the convergence rate of MRIV is, and compare it to the Wald estimator. Subsequently, a TARnet-like architecture of a deep network (but with two distinct representations) is proposed in order to estimate the nuisance parameters (this can be plugged in to step one of the MRIV procedure).
