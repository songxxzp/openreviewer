The framework is based on an episodic finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) instead of the MDP with a discounted factor and infinite horizon. Under this framework, this paper proposes a Risk-Aware Upper Confidence Bound (RA-UCB) for performing value iteration under a coherent risk measure by applying non-linear function approximation. The theoretical results provide the regret upper bound guarantee of RA-UCB. To develop this bound, this paper decomposes the risk-aware RL policy\u2019s egret by the super-additivity property of coherent risk measures and assumes access to a weak simulator. Some empirical results are presented to empirically demonstrate the performance of this algorithm.",

To the best of the reviewer's knowledge, the RA-UCB algorithm is novel. The way it defines means and variances of action values is inspiring, especially after acknowledging their similarity with the Gaussian process regression and linear bandits problem, ** although more explanation about the insights is appreciated.**\n\n3. The framework for analyzing the regret of risk-aware RL policy can be scaled to coherent risk measures, as opposed to Fei et al. (2021) which used the entropic risk measure. The theoretical results are meaningful and important, which leads to the first sub-linear regret upper bound of the risk-aware RL policy with coherent risk measures.\n\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The algorithm assumes access to a weak simulator. Although this assumption is less influential compared to the ones in previous works, the algorithm becomes no longer model-free and how to alleviate the assumption will be an important direction.\n\n2. Many previous works have explored implementing risk-sensitive RL with non-linear function approximation. While the related works section covers most of them, it is still unclear whether the difference is significant.\n\n3. The empirical results are weak, but I won't argue for more since the main contribution is on the theory side.\n",

The proposed algorithm, RA-UCB, learns a RKHS representation for the Q-value function.  A key technical challenge is that a single sample does not suffice to form an estimate of the risk measure, so an assumption is used that a \u201cweak simulator\u201d which can sample the transition dynamics.  While the primary contribution is theoretical, small simulation demonstrate an implementation with CVaR as the risk measure.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "On this positive side I\u2019m appreciative of the overall agenda of risk-aware RL.  I agree that coherent risk measures in particular are interesting.  The idea of using a weak simulator to enable estimating them is nice.  So overall I am quite positive about the theoretical results.\n\nOn the negative side, the paper lacks a related work section.  I was left wondering about the relationship to work such as distributional RL.  While there is a related work section in the appendix, for the purposes of this review I am ignoring it as to do otherwise would be abusive of the page limits.  I do not believe this paper is complete without a proper discussion of related work.\n\nI found the clarity of presentation to be a notable negative.  I discuss this in more detail below, but I have a hard time digging out the insights behind the way the weak simulator is used from the presentation.  On a technical level, I am somewhat concerned about the form of the objective given by equation (2).  The justifications provided for it seem to center around technical convenience (e.g. guaranteeing the optimal policy is Markov).  But how does this form of the objective affect the \u201cmeaning\u201d of the risk measure chosen relative to the \u201cstatic\u201d version?  Finally, while a smaller issue for a paper whose contributions are largely theoretical, it is a bit disappointing that after a pitch about how prior work was specialized for CVaR but this approach was more general, all the experiments only used CVaR.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Overall I found the technical exposition quite dense and hard to follow.  While there were some references to the prior literature, I also found it hard to distinguish which parts of the analysis are novel.  For example, how much of the analysis of the first term in Theorem 1 is standard?  I found equations (6)-(8) quite hard to parse as limited intuition is given for the roles all the different pieces are playing.  \n\nSince the main story of the paper is around estimating the risk-aware update, the biggest issue of this type for me was around how this is actually done and how performance depends on the number of samples.  The latter is wrapped up in a function and presumably buried somewhere in the appendix.  Corollary 1 gives a sufficient number of sample only for one special case.  In the experiments I can\u2019t actually figure out how many samples were used!  The computational complexity part is confusing because it says the memory is O(N^2) where N is the number of samples (which is m earlier).  But then it says this is O(t^2) for episode t and I don\u2019t understand why the number of samples should vary with the episode number.  Looking at (6) I can see how I the memory used by K^t should scale with quadratically t, but the definitions just list an arbitrary number of samples m so I don\u2019t see where these are being scaled.  I don\u2019t even quite understand the details of how (7) actually makes use of the samples; I suspect it would help to unpack some of the definitions for the reader.\n\nIn a more minor note, while I have seen the form of regret in (5) used before, my sense is that it is at least somewhat unusual (though perhaps standard in a certain sub-literature and needs some references and discussion.",
