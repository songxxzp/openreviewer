            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes a new framework for higher-order link prediction. The paper creates hyperedges embedding (local information) and combines this information with clustering embedding (global information). Both pieces of information were supposed to be combined using an MLP for the final classification process.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The introduction is well-written and stated the main problem. The related work covers several points of topics and papers. The methodology of the experiment section is also strong. It has several baselines, different problems are considered, and an ablation study is applied to check the importance of each stage of the framework. However, there are several weaknesses that must be improved. \n\nThe most important issue is the clarity of the paper. The paper tries to be general, so different approaches can be considered. This can be observed with the use of functions such as AGG, \\Omega, and others. However, this generality loses the main focus of the paper, and the framework becomes complex (even though it is simple). So, in general, the three sections explaining the main framework must be improved. \n\nThe use of space can also be improved. For example, most of subsection 4.1 can be resumed in a single paragraph. Figure 2 can be explained in a single paragraph, and figure 1 from the appendix could be incorporated into the paper. You can also add the time complexity of the framework (a small part is mentioned in the appendix). This will make the paper stronger. \n\nAnother problem is reproducibility. Unfortunately, several details are omitted. From the use of the clustering algorithm, to all the hyperparameters used in the framework. \n\nMinor comments:\nFigure 1: it says project instead of paper. \nFigure 1 (\"right\" part): it says Prediect\nFigure 5: use a white background, increase the size of the font for the legend, and improve the caption mentioning that it is for a specific experiment.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is novel. It is a new framework that combines local and global characteristics for higher-order link prediction. With respect to quality, as with every framework, it is a combination of multiple methods. So, it seems fine, and no problem can be observed. However, there are important problems with respect to clarity and reproducibility.\n\nThe clarity must be improved before publication. Even though it seems a simple framework based on the figures, it is very complicated to understand the process. Unfortunately, this also affects the reproducibility of the paper (even though the codes are available). Just as an example, the clustering process is based on \"state-of-the-art hierarchical partitioning based clustering tools\", but the final algorithm is not mentioned in the paper. Similarly, the selection of the number of clusters is supposed to be based on equation 7, but again, it is difficult to figure out the selection given that almost no description is given. Similar problems can be observed in sections 3 and 5. \n\nThe previous problems also affect the reproducibility of the experiments. For example, no details are given about the MLP and the number of clusters for each problem. What is the clustering algorithm (hierarchical is just mentioned)? What are the characteristics of the MLP? How do you select the number of clusters?\n",

First, how important hyper-parameters are set like the number of iteration of message-passing k. Also it would be better to have an experiment on the sensitivity of the parameters. Second, for hyper-edge classification, what is the evaluation protocol e.g. how are the negative samples generated and what is positive to negative ratio etc. In Table 4, does HQ the same as HyperQuery. Also, what is the exact definition of the minimax operation and the bilinear operation used?\n2.Besides hyper-graph based approaches, the authors should compare the proposed method to graph-based methods as well. A neutral choice would be casting the problem as a graph classification problem by flattening all hyper-edges. Comparison to some simple heuristics like graph structure features like number of edges would also be very helpful. \n3.The authors mention the classification of hyperedge types. Seems no experiment is carried out in section 6? Also in section 6.2, why use 70% for test and only use 20% for training?\n",

Although the paper is mostly free from grammatical errors, the text and figures are confusing in many aspects. See my questions below.\n- Different elements of the proposed HyperQuery framework seem to be chosen and combined in ad-hoc manner that doesn't provide much insight into why they work.\n- Novelty of different elements in the HyperQuery framework is unclear. \n\nQuestions:\n1. What is Figure 2 supposed to show? On the left pane, I can't tell what the hyperedges are. What are the colored dashed lines supposed to show? Are these the hops in the random walk? What is the right pane supposed to show?\n2. What are the quantities \\#train, \\#valid, and \\#test referring to? They don't appear to map to either the number of entities or relations. Are these counts of hyperedges?\n3. I don't understand the evaluation in Section 6.1. What counts as a hit for hit\\@1 and hit\\@3? Is there a way to give partial credit if HyperQuery is given a query for a subset of entities that have a hyperedge? For example, if a hyperedge exists between $(e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4)$ but the query is for $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$, what is the correct answer, and how is it evaluated?\n\nTypos and minor issues:\n- Figure 1: Prediect -> Predict\n- Section 5.2, first line: varience -> variance\n- Placement of Figure 2 on page 3 seems odd. It is not referenced anywhere around that page, and not until Section 4.1 on page 5. Perhaps Figure 2 should be moved after Figure 3, which is referenced much earlier. Similarly, Figure 5 is in a strange location, showing up before Tables 2-4 despite not being referred to until afterwards.\n- Inconsistent use of the notation $\\mathcal{N}(\\cdot)$. $\\mathcal{N}(v_i)$ is stated to denote the neighborhood of node $v_i$ (incorrectly denoted as $N(v_i)$ in the Figure 3 caption). Then what is $\\mathcal{N}(e)$ for a hyperedge $e$? Is it a union of the neighborhoods for all nodes $v_i \\in e$?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity: Low. Unlike most papers that are poorly presented, this paper is mostly free of grammatical errors and typos, but the descriptions of key components in the text and figures are either missing details or unclear.\n- Quality: Medium. Proposed framework and experimental evaluation appear to be technically sound, but I can't say that with high confidence due to the poor presentation.\n- Novelty: Medium. There appear to be some novel components in the proposed HyperQuery framework, but the main novelty is in addressing the hyperedge prediction problem, where there is not much existing literature.\n- Reproducibility: Medium. Code is provided, although I did not examine it in detail. There are not enough details in the experiment descriptions and supplements for me to reproduce the experiments. I'm not even certain of how the evaluation is being conducted, as indicated by my questions above.\n",

Similarly, the figures look good, but I am not sure what several of them are supposed to show.\n\nI think there is a lot of potential in this paper but would not recommend it for publication at this time.
