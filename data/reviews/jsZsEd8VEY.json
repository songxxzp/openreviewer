            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper combines graph neural networks with point cloud information to improve the performance of the popular graph network simulators. Standard graph network simulators accumulate prediction errors, causing predicted dynamic states to drift over time. The key idea in this paper is using point cloud information whenever available to counteract such drift and error accumulation. The paper provides three experiments involving 2D and 3D deformable objects to evaluate the proposed approach.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**\nThe paper tackles a critical research problem: error accumulation from long-term prediction of graph neural simulators. Fusing sensor data into dynamic prediction is a reasonable strategy. The paper is also well-written and articulates its core idea clearly.\n\n**Weakness**\nRegarding the technical method:\nI think using point cloud to enhance dynamic prediction is a good direction to explore, but I feel the proposed method is not quite ready and the problem setup in this paper is a bit contrived: the point cloud data is generated from the ground truth mesh in a simulator and seems much denser than the mesh nodes (the DoFs in simulation). I would be much more excited if the paper could tackle noisy, sparse, partially observable point clouds (e.g., from meshes with self-occlusion) that are common in real-world 3D point clouds.\n\nOn a related note, I am trying to understand this paper from another perspective: Consider using the node positions from the ground-truth simulator as the point cloud input to this approach, i.e., once in a few frames, the method sees the ground-truth mesh node locations (are these exactly what we want the network to predict?) but without edge information. In this case, I am unsure whether predicting new states is still a challenging problem. Since the point cloud used in this paper seems denser, I guess the problem setup in the paper is even easier. Of course, the authors should feel free to correct me if I misunderstand something.\n\nRegarding the experiment:\n- The physics parameters used in the dataset are not very realistic (5000Pa Youngs modulus and {-0.9, 0, 0.49} Poisson\u2019s ratio). A few more physics parameters, e.g., the density of the material and the size of the object, seem missing.\n- Fig. 4: Could you show the side view of this scene, e.g., seeing the deformable object from its left?\n- Overlaying the point cloud data on the deformable object in Fig. 1 is nice and informative. Is there a similar figure for the other two examples?\n- It looks like the point cloud is typically denser than the mesh nodes (600 vs. 81 in B.1 and 850 vs. 361 in B.2), so I guess \u201cvoxel-subsample\u201d in the text describing the alpha-shape baseline means downsampling the point cloud to have similar node numbers as the mesh. Why not creating alpha shapes directly from the original point cloud?\n- Fig. 6 (b): Does k = 1 mean a point cloud is available in every time step?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "I think the paper is easy to follow with most of the low-level details properly left out in the supplemental materials.\n\nFig. 1 was a bit confusing when I read the paper for the first time, but most of it became understandable after reading the corresponding sections:\n- It is still unclear to me what solid and dashed lines in Fig. 1 attempt to imply, although it is not a very big deal.\n- Why is there an inference arrow pointing from GNN outputs back to \u201cState at Step t\u201d?\n\nThe technical method does not seem complicated to implement. Therefore, I think the paper is probably reproducible. It could be better if the authors could release the code.\n\nOne thing that is unclear to me is how the collisions between the rigid and soft bodies are handled in their experiments, and it would be nice if the supplemental materials could include more detailed descriptions about it.\n",

Both quantitive and qualitative results verify the effectiveness of these simple designs.\n\n\u201cOur method, however, omits this explicit representation in favor of a simple one-hot encoding of the type of input edge.\u201d. The authors should have provided an explanation of why they prefer the one-hot encoding.\n\nMore insights should have been brought into the paper when the authors make a comparison against the recurrent imputation model. It is suggested to provide some visualization of the simulation results between the recurrent imputation model and GGNS.\n\nIt remains unclear to the reviewer the influence of the simulated result on downstream applications in model predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning, which seems to be an obvious limitation to demonstrate the model\u2019s practical value.\n",
