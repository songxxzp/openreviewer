            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a normalizing flow-based autoencoder (AE-Flow) to address medical image anomaly detection.  The AE-Flow model contains three components, an encoder to extract features of the input images, a flow model to convert extracted feature vector to the specific feature space, which follows a standard normal distribution, and a decoder to reconstruct the image from normally distributed data. In the inference stage, a flow score and a reconstruction loss are combined into the final anomaly score. Its contribution to medical image anomaly detection is to adopt the normalizing flow-based method to supervise the model training deeply. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1. This paper adopts a normalizing flow for anomaly detection. The final anomaly score consists of a negative probability density of the normalized feature and reconstruction error, which supervises the model training at both image and pixel levels. \n2. Two different datasets (OCT and CT) are used to conduct some comparison experiments to evaluate the effectiveness.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. Direct anomaly detection is little help for medical image diagnosis.  It would be more meaningful to mark the abnormal areas, especially small lesions. \n2. It is a standard solution to combine auto-encoder with the normalizing flow for anomaly detection. \n3. It'd be better to explain why \u03b1 and \u03b2 values are sensitive for the final performance. If we can unify and fix \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters, it will greatly reduce the model training time and will be more available for users. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": " I think the biggest weakness behind this paper is the lack of novelty. There have been some papers to combine auto-encoder and normalizing flows, and this multi-task training is more common in anomaly detection. \n\nIn addition, when a reconstruction loss (such as MSE) is applied to the reconstruction module, overfitting may become a major problem. To my knowledge,  the network could learn an identify mapping more easily. \n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors present AE-FLOW, an autoencoder-based method for anomaly detection using normalizing flows in the latent space. Anomaly detection is an important problem in medical imaging, becuase in some domains, screening for abnormal diagnoses is critical. The authors propose using normalizing flows to learn an efficient and tractable distribution of medical images. An anomaly score is calculated using both the negative probability density and the negative reconstruction error. The encoder and decoder consist of conventional convolutional layers with downsampling and upsampling, respectively. The normalizing flow bottleneck consists of eight flow blocks. The model contains two major hyperparameters: one that interpolates between the flow and reconstruction losses and one that interpolates between the flow and reconstruction scores. The authors use two medical image dataset, OCT images and chest xrays. They were able to show that AE-FLOW outperforms other anomaly detection baselines on several metrics. An ablation study was performed that that demonstrated both the flow and reconstruction losses are important for overall performance. The authors show qualitative results using residual images generated from the original and reconstruction images. Abnormal images show much large residual values compared to normal images. ",

The authors do a good job presenting the results and show good performance over the other baselines; but I am still unsure as why the model is outperforming the others. \n\n2) If one is to use this model for inference on a new example, how would you select a threshold for the anomaly score? The authors seem to have selected an anomaly score based on the testing set F1 scores. For a better model evaluation, identifying an anomaly score using a validation set, then testing on a true held out testing set seems to be the best way to determine the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc. of AE-FLOW. This cross-validation experiment can be added to an appendix. \n\n3) The method applies in general for anomaly detection. Providing results in a non-medical dataset would strengthen the experimental results for AE-FLOW.  This could also be supplemental data. \n",
