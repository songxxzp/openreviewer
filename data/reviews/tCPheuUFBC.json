They developed a module that extract feature map by convolution with a stride that changes adaptively according to the changes of input features.\n\nThey apply the proposed module on many convolutional neural network models such as VGG, Alexnet, MobileNet, YOLOX-S and UNET. Simulation results are also provided to show the efficiency of the module.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The topic of this paper is very interesting and the main strength relies on its technical novelty, since the authors propose a module based on a dynamic stride for convolution operation. However, this paper lacks mathematical models that can help to understand difference between fixed and dynamic strides. \n\nWhen using a dynamic stride, it is not clear if the size of the model (number of parameters will change) or the speed (number of operations). Could you discuss also this question ?",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n * Learning strides by backpropagation is still an open question as previous work that address this task suffer from a significant increase in computation cost compared to standard strided convolutions.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* The paper needs a complete rewriting, see points below:\n  * The paper is very hard to read, with unfinished sentences, useless sentences (eg. the first paragraph of the introduction should just be removed) and many grammar and syntax errors. An example is the first paragraph of the Methods section which I just do not understand.\n  * The total absence of notations and model details only provides the reader with a vague and abstract idea of the method.\n  * Figures 2 and 3 take almost a page just to illustrate the basic mechanism of striding, which is a waste of space.\n  * Many typos such as \"comprision\" in Figure 4, \"Classification of network\" as a title Section 3.1.1.\n  * Paragraph 2.2 is just a rewriting of paragraph 2.1.5, with copy-pasted sentences (!)\n* The method in itself is very questionable. First, unless I missed it, the method seems to only mask the target feature map leaving zero entries, which means that regardless of the \"adaptive stride\" learned by the model, there is no actual striding applied and the spatial dimensions remain constant in the entire network. This is completely different from striding, which effectively downsamples an image such that kernels of upper layers process inputs at lower resolutions. Moreover, the method suffers from the same limitation of [DiffStride](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01653)  as it first needs to compute an unstrided convolution + a mask produced itself by a convnet, which is overall much more costly than a simple strided convolution. This observation coupled to the fact that the model does not actually downsample but rather keep the spatial dimensions constant along the network lets me think that this model is much slower than baselines.\n* Not comparing to DiffStride and claiming that \"the current academic research on the stride adaptation [...] is basically blank\", the absence of confidence intervals, the lack of details on the experimental setting and the absence of time/space complexity analysis makes it impossible to evaluate the method in the current state.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "it's very hard to find something positive to say about the paper in its current state.\nClarity is very bad (c.f. comments on writing above), novelty is impossible to evaluate since the model description is very vague and experiments are weak. The lack of details also makes the method unreproducible at the moment.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper needs to be rewritten entirely and better experiments realized (more details, more baselines) to convince the reader that the method is worth. I also would appreciate that authors explain how downsampling is actually performed, because otherwise the title and claims are misleading.",
