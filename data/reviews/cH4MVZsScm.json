            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \n\n+ Combining strengths of data-driven methods and control methods is attractive, especially for robotics applications such as controlling UAVs.\n\n+ The control approach is mathematically formulated and analyzed.\n\nWeakness:\n\n- It seems the argued novelty focuses on addressing out-of-distribution data. However, the paper simply uses a deep neural network (inspired by Shi et al. 2021) to model the unknown environment-dependent dynamics. Why is this neural network capable of modeling such an unknown dynamic during the execution time? How does this neural network model the environment? If the dynamics in the execution phase is unknown and different from the training phase, how to especially model or address this difference?\n\n- The integration of data-driven methods and control theories is simple. The proposed approach assumes the expectation of the prediction of the unknown dynamics remains the same for a perturbation of radius, and uses conventional control theories to analyze the bound. However, this assumption may not be true in the real-world scenario. Even if it is true, how to deal with the transition between areas that may have different perturbations.\n\n- What is the relationship between out-of-distribution data and perturbations? \n\n- When comparing with previous out-of-distribution generalization methods in related work, the paper argues previous methods suffers from \u201cneglecting the gap between the simulation experiments and reality\u201d. The proposed method is also not evaluated on a real system. It is not convincing that the proposed method can be applied to a real UAV.\n\n- The paper generally argues that it is difficult or impractical to model the environment-dependent dynamics. Then in the experiment, the paper uses the widely used Dryden model to simulate wind field. Given this Dryden model, why is it challenging to model the dynamics?\n",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**:\n\nThe problem is very relevant and the experimental results look very good.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\nThe paper follows Shi et al. (2021) very closely and does not always explain the terminology and choices. This makes the paper sometimes hard to read, as the theoretical contribution comes across as somewhat unmotivated and require large jumps in reasoning. The problem is compounded by some (in this reviewer's opinion) apparent errors in the math. More thoroughness and more explanation on the assumptions, used transformations and definitions would probably improve the paper a lot. \nThe reviewer would like the authors to explain the following:\n1. Is the defined ACE measure useful for OoD generalization? Note that $|| \\mathbb E[x_t^{(z)}] - x_t^d ||$ is zero for symmetric effects, e.g. wind blows equally often from left and right. A controller with ACE=0 can therefore still perform arbitrarily bad! Shi et al. (2021) seem to optimize $\\mathbb E[||x_t^{(z)} - x_t^d ||]$. Please compare the two definitions and state your reasoning for choosing one.\n2. Section 4.1 introduces an important *required* property; how does Th.1 prove this?\tAssuming the right-hand side of (eq.5) is $p$, how do you guarantee that $\\tilde h_{\\pi_0}(x_t^{(z)}) > p$?\n3. Theorem 1 uses the substitution $h_{\\pi_0}(x_t^{(z)} + \\delta)$ to $h_{\\pi_\\delta}(x_t^{(z)})$, where $\\pi_{\\delta}$ is defined as \"the distribution of $z + \\delta$\". How does the transformation $x_t^{(z)} + \\delta$ to $x_t^{(z+\\delta)}$ work? Don't these $\\delta$'s have different dimensionality?\n4. The current use of $\\tilde h$ is very unintuitive. Could you elaborate how one has to interpret $\\tilde h_{\\pi_0}(x_t^{(z)})$, in particular for the crucial (eq.8)?\n5. (eq.10) and (eq.11) seem to ignore $x_{t+1}^d$. To make sense in (eq.12), (eq.10) should have $x_{t+1}^d$ in the RHS bracket and the LHS of (eq.11) should be $x_{t+1}^{(z)} - x_{t+1}^d$.  Similarly, Corollary 2 seems to miss $x_{t+1}^d$ in the definition of $e_f$.\n6. The $p$ in (eq.12) is not defined, but combining the reviewers interpretation of (eq.8) and (eq.11) would mean $p$ is the rhs of (eq.8). Is this correct?\n7. How important is Corollary 2? Can you make an ablation with and without considering control misspecification? Also, where does $K_v$ come from?\n8. Algorithm 1 is not understandable without reading Shi et al. (2021).\tPlease augment the appendix with a self-contained description.\n9. Please indicate which experimental results are statistically significant. For example, in Table 1 only row 3 (and maybe 2) look as if OoD is significantly better than OMAC, whereas in Table 2 all **but** row 9 look significant. Just claiming \"is higher\" is not meaningful. \n",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The work deals with the very pertinent topic of OoD performance for learned dynamics\n- The theoretical bound shown, without the need for the restrictive eISS assumption is a notable contribution for nonlinear under-actuated systems.\n- The performance of the control protocol is impressive in simulation, not only against previous work but even with respect to omniscient ground truth controllers\n- Simulation work is of good quality, permitting clean comparison of baselines and a clear presentation of the results. \n\nWeaknesses:\nThe work is theoretically sound and relevant. The experimental setup however leaves some claims unexplained and many important questions unanswered.\n-  The authors claim in section 5.4 (quadrotor) that \"As the wind field in the testing environment is quite different from the training environment, our algorithm performs relatively better than the baseline and no-adapt.\" Apart from the poor grammatical phrasing, the only material in the paper that comes to support that claim is in appendix B.6.1 \"The wind comes from only one octant, so it differs\nfrom test environment in not only distribution but also direction. The models are trained in only one\nenvironment. Our OoD-Control model adapts well in testing even though the training material is\nquite little.\" Again neglecting the very poor wording of the last sentence, one fails to see how much OoD testing is really happening, i.e. how dissimilar the settings really are to the DNN.\n- An important study would include pushing the architecture to its limits with perturbations of increasingly different distributions and directions. The out of distribution capacities claimed in the very model name OoD-Control, are not significantly exhibited. \n- Along the same lines, a precise explanation of the data consumed to train the model is missing, \"quite little\" being an unacceptable unit of measure for a machine learning conference paper. This remark generalises to the entire training framework which remains very obscure: what model architecture is used? Of what size? What is the data pipeline setup? etc.\n- What about other control methods to fight the wind ? Why only benchmark against OMAC ? The authors claim \"most of the previously mentioned control\nmethods suffer from limitations. Imprecise system modeling and non-modeled environmental\ndisturbances may result in unacceptable performance or instability.\" It would be worth comparing the performance against state of the art robust control protocols for example to support this claim. \n- The authors fail to discuss any possibility of using this algorithm in the real world. The natural limitations of data collection via Monte Carlo methods make this method trainable in simulation. What about the simulation to reality gap? Have the authors considered training a OoD-Controller in simulation and attempting to measure its performance on real hardware? Any results in this direction would be of great value.\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The notation and wording is tedious to follow is some instances. For example, the wording \"prediction error\" of the unknown dynamics is (correctly) used to refer to $ \\epsilon = f(x^{(z)}_t , c) \u2212 \\hat{f}(x^{(z)}_t , \\hat{c}) $ (implicitly throughout the paper, explicitly page 6 lemma 2), in which case indeed \"the methodology provides the guaranteed upper bound for the prediction errors of the unknown dynamics\". \n\nHowever, on page 4 (beginning of section 4.1) \"prediction error\" is used to refer to $\\tilde{h}_{\\pi_0}(x^{(z)}_t)$ and now ($\\tilde{h}$ being monotonically decreasing) a \"lower bound of the prediction error maintains constant under unpredictable disturbance\". \n\nIn fact, the $\\tilde{h}_{\\pi_0}(x^{(z)}_t)$ shorthand is also used without explicit definition in this section. These might be small details but reduce the quality of presentation and thus reader appreciation of the core theoretical work behind the method.\n\nThe above mentioned example is not a singularity. The overall clarity of the paper, in terms of better wording and grammatical construction, could do with some improvement.",

This seems to offer improved expressiveness in learning simulated wind dynamics, and thus improved performance against earlier work. The authors' claim that the architecture achieves OoD generalisation remains however questionable, or to the least has not been explored to the fullest.
