            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studied the approximation error of neural networks in approximating a parametric p-Laplace equation with the homogeneous Neumann boundary condition. The main result (theorem 1) established an W^{1,p}-error bound for an approximate solution in terms of the energy difference and the minimum W^{1,p}-error of the underlying approximation function class. The authors also discussed how the error bound can be used to prove that neural networks can beat the curse of dimensionality when the exact solution of the PDE is sufficiently smooth or Barron. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: The error estimate in Theorem 1 seems to be new in the study of p-Laplace equation. The key ingredient of the analysis is a Cea type lemma which was proved for the case p=2 previously. The paper extends this to the general case that p\\geq 1.\n\nWeakness: The results obtained in the paper are all about the p-Laplacian equation alone and no new results were presented from the side of machine learning (or neural networks).  Hence to me the paper is more suitable for a journal publication in the field of numerical PDEs but not in a conference proceeding of machine learning.",

The main result of the paper, Theorem 1, shows that any function $v$ in a (very general) subset of function $\\widetilde{M}$ is such that $|\\nabla v - \\nabla u_\\star|_{L^p}$ can be upper bounded by a constant multiple of the sum of the energy gap $A = \\mathcal{E}(v) - \\text{inf}\\big(  \\mathcal{E}(v') : v' \\in \\widetilde{M} \\Big)$ and the quantity $B = \\text{inf}\\Big( |\\nabla v' - \\nabla u_\\star| : v' \\in \\widetilde{M} \\Big)$ related to the quality of the approximating subspace $\\widetilde{M}$.\n\nSince the quantity $B$ is quite well studied (i.e. approximation theory of neural network spaces), this shows that any algorithm that can minimise the energy functional leads to good approximation to the solution $u_\\star$.",
