            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper demonstrates that one can achieve state-of-the-art certified $l_2$-robustness using the existing method of denoised smoothing, by simply replacing the custom denoiser by an off-the-shelf diffusion model. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The method is technically very simple, and yet highly effective, which I view as a major strength. The result is significant because it is a \"scale is all you need\" type result for certified robustness, which has the potential to have a big impact on this subfield as a whole.\nThe authors also provide some additional experiments as ablations, which I believe to be valuable, i.e. showing that fine-tuning can help and demonstrating that a variety of noise levels improve the denoisers over more restricted noise levels.\nThe authors compare to many baselines which is good.\n\nHowever, one point of criticism is that the authors do not actually provide any results on full diffusion as opposed to one-shot denoising. They provide convincing intuitive explanations of why one would expect that one-shot denoising is better suited for this task, but the examples they provide might be quite cherry-picked. I suspect that the reason why they do not provide numbers for comparison is that, as they admit, it is far too expensive to run this many steps on every single forward pass (of which many thousands are needed for randomized smoothing). I think the authors need to either a) include numbers for full diffusion (preferred option) or b) weaken their language in Section 3 where they claim in the paragraph on \"High accuracy\" that \"Section 5 experimentally validates this hypothesis.\"\n\nAnother minor criticism is about the misleading title. I understand that this title is good for calling attention to this paper but I find \"for free\" to be very misleading, given that of course the accuracy vs. (certified) robustness tradeoff still persists and, crucially, that each verified sample still takes orders of magnitude more resources than a single prediction. A less snappy, though more accurate title would be much better.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is written very clearly. The only thing I believe should be clarified better is the latency description in Section 4 (\"is 1.5 seconds per image on an A100 GPU at a batch size of 32\"). Presumably, this is not the time it takes to verify an image but just to classify it so make this crystal-clear to all readers.\nI have no negative comments about quality, novelty or reproducibility.",

If there are performance gains compared to unperturbed images, then this result will show the improvement is due to the fact that denoised images are more robust to Gaussian perturbations than clean images.",

The main idea is to use a denoiser after introducing noise for robustness certification and well-trained diffusion models can work well as denoisers. The noise introduced by the diffusion models can be used seen as the smoothing process and single-step denoising is then applied. Their main contribution is extending the denoising-based certification model to using a diffusion model. They take advantage of the recent advances in diffusion models and greatly improve the quality of denoising and certification. The experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR both show significant improvement in certification accuracy.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \n- An elegant solution to a challenging problem. The intuition and method are both relatively simple, yet highly effective. Although it is not so novel as the idea of using a denoiser is already proposed, using a diffusion model is novel, and pre-trained diffusion models significantly improve denoising accuracy. \n- The one-step denoising is well-thought-of. It reduces computation costs by a great deal. Yet I'm curious why the certification accuracy is worse when the denoising result is more accurate.\n\nWeakness:\n- I hope to see more details on the hyperparameters for the diffusion process, including the noise scale during diffusion \\alpha_t, and the number of diffusion steps chosen during smoothing as it is related to the smoothing level. \n- I would like to see details on the backbone model for baseline models, as using ViT VS. ResNet could be very different in terms of clean accuracy on ImageNet.",
