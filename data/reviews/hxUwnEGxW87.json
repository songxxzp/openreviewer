Specifically, the authors prove upper and lower bounds on DP estimation of PrivBayes, a marginal-based Bayesian network synthetic data generation method. More specifically, the authors prove upper-bounds on the total variation and L2 distance between the estimated distribution and the true distribution under the assumption that the raw data is generated from a graph with causal edges and bounded number of parent nodes for each node. The authors also show utility upper bounds, as well as total variation lower bounds.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- The paper tackles an interesting problem, synthetic data generation under differential privacy\n- The paper is clearly written and relatively straightforward to follow\n- The bounds provide an interesting picture on the dependency to various factors (size of training data n, dimension d, 'breadth' of the model k, budget epsilon, etc.)\n\nWeaknesses\n- the upper bound seems rather loose. For example, theorem 4.1 depends exponentially on k. If we plug n=40k, d=40 and epsilon=10 which are generarous estimates, we get 12 d^2/(n*epsilon) ~ 0.05 so with k=3 the bounds becomes vacuous (and that's without looking at the log factor). ",

There is an aside claim that it can be generalized to any categorical data with finite support, but this extension is not clear from the paper. Also, it does not seem that the main steps would extend easily without considerable problems related to scaling of the computations. It is not clear to me whether the BN is estimated from the data, or is considered known. If it is estimated from the data, is the estimation algorithm differentially private? \n",

For typical values of k, d and n the values seem\nto be way larger than 1 and not entirely useful?\n\n   (ii) Experiments showing the tightness of the lower and upper bounds on real-world datasets would have been helpful in understanding the strengths and limitations of the theory. \n",
