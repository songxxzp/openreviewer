            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to learn general-purpose location embeddings which are useful for downstream geospatial prediction tasks. The idea is to learn this representation by binning geographic entity occurrence data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and applying a convolutional autoencoder with a special custom decoder head. The binning and convolution are done on a hexagonal grid. The proposed method (GeoVeX) is compared against two competing approaches to geospatial representation learning (Hex2Vec and Space2Vec) on two datasets. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strengths\n* Learning geospatial representations that generalize to many downstream tasks is an interesting and worthwhile goal. \n* The idea of autoencoding OSM data is a reasonable approach to geospatial representation learning.\n* The proposed ZIP head is novel to the best of my knowledge. \n\n# Weaknesses\n* A key claim of the paper is that it produces \"the first geospatial vectors trained on worldwide open data\" - this does not seem to be true as written. For instance, [mac2019presence] learns embeddings for each location on earth from freely available data from iNaturalist. See also [sheehan2019predicting], which represents locations using embeddings of nearby geo-located Wikipedia articles. \n* A key claim of the paper is that the proposed method learns \"task-agnostic global geospatial vectors.\" Are they task agnostic? It is not obvious to me that using OSM data makes it \"task agnostic\" automatically, since OSM contains a limited set of categories with a particular focus on certain land use / land cover categories. More broadly, if the claim is that the proposed method learns significantly more general features than prior methods, it would probably make sense to demonstrate this on more than two datasets. \n* A key claim of that paper is that it is \"the first use of hexagonal convolutions within autoencoder architectures.\" First, I would like to be convinced that this is significant by itself. Can't hexagonal convolutions can be used with any convolutional architecture? Is there a reason we wouldn't expect it to work for autoencoders? Second, it seems like [hahner2022mesh] may have done this first - please comment and clarify. \n* It's a bit tricky to interpret the results in Table 1 and Table 2 without more context. The magnitude of the performance differences between the methods seems small, and the ranking of methods seems to depend on the metric. Given this, it may be important to report average results across a few training runs (both the representation learning and the GBM) to determine whether we are observing robust performance differences or random fluctuations.\n* GeoVeX several components, including the use of hexagonal spatial units, the ZIP head, and special terms in the loss function, none of which are characterized with an ablation study. The relative importance of these components is therefore unclear. \n\nMinor comments:\n* The paper claims that a linear probe does not work well in this context because GBM does better than the linear probe when combined with the baseline features. But isn't this what we'd expect if the baseline features are not very good? We would expect linear regression to work better with more powerful features. \n* Why are GeoVeX features always combined with task-specific features (Figure 1)? Why not evaluate the utility of the features on their own for downstream tasks? \n* In the related work section, the paper notes that Space2Vec \"uses trigonometric functions with different frequencies to model a given position in space... However, the embeddings are not learnt based on the nearby geographical entities...\" - note that [mac2019presence] does both of those things, where the geographic entities are species observations. \n\n@inproceedings{sheehan2019predicting,\n  title={Predicting economic development using geolocated wikipedia articles},\n  author={Sheehan, Evan and Meng, Chenlin and Tan, Matthew and Uzkent, Burak and Jean, Neal and Burke, Marshall and Lobell, David and Ermon, Stefano},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 25th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery \\& data mining},\n  pages={2698--2706},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{mac2019presence,\n  title={Presence-only geographical priors for fine-grained image classification},\n  author={Mac Aodha, Oisin and Cole, Elijah and Perona, Pietro},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision},\n  pages={9596--9606},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{hahner2022mesh,\n  title={Mesh Convolutional Autoencoder for Semi-Regular Meshes of Different Sizes},\n  author={Hahner, Sara and Garcke, Jochen},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision},\n  pages={885--894},\n  year={2022}\n}",
