The proposed approach is based on machine learning techniques, and novel training approach introduced by the authors. The authors show that the proposed method provides performance close to that of the successive cancellation list decoder.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is very well written, and the proposed training method seems to be novel, although I am not an expert in machine learning.\n\nThe main problem with the paper is that it lacks proper complexity comparison with state-of-the-art decoding techniques for polar codes, and throughput results presented in Table 1 are quite disappointing. In particular, this table implies that the authors obtained decoder throughput for (32,16) code 13008 b/s for SCL(L=4) and 533333 b/s for CRISP.  However, it was shown in  [L2019] that SCL decoder with larger list size L=8 for much longer code (128,64) provides single-threaded throughput more that 3.5 Mb/s.  The discussion after Table 1 suggests, that the obtained results correspond to a multi-threaded implementation, so actual throughput gap is even worse.\n\nPlease observe that the SCL decoder is not the best one in terms of throughput.  Much more efficient decoding algorithms are known, e.g. FastSCL, sequential and trellis-based decoding algorithms [A2019,T2018,T2020]. The authors do not provide performance and complexity comparison with these techniques.  Lack of comparison with sequential decoders is particularly disappointing, since the authors themselves introduced a sequential-type decoder.  \n\nThe authors use throughput of a software decoder as a complexity benchmark. This approach is quite unreliable and difficult to interpret, since it depends on software engineering skills and hardware platform features.  The reviewer suggests to use the number of arithmetic operations performed by the decoder as a benchmark. This would enable comparison with other published results.\n\nThe authors use non-standard notation (k,n) to denote the parameters of polar codes. The standard coding theory notation is (n,k), where n is code length and k is code dimension.\n\n[L2019] L\u00e9onardon, M., Cassagne, A., Leroux, C. et al.

To me, the main strength is showing a method of decoding which has some intuition behind it. That is, the decoding is done sequentially, like in SC decoding of polar codes. Another strength is that the authors seem to have found a complexity/error rate point that other algorithms cannot match.
