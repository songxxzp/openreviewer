            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method that learns a set of policies that can cover all modalities of the demonstration dataset. The proposed method first models the state distribution of the demonstrations using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In this paper, a trajectory is represented with indices of the top $d_z$ mixture components that best describe state distributions of the trajectory. Then, this paper searches for policies that best represent each of the trajectory representations using an evolutionary algorithm, which randomly samples policies, rollouts the policies, encodes resulting trajectories into trajectory representations, stores the best policy for each trajectory representation, and iterates this process. Since each trajectory representation holds a policy that generates the corresponding trajectory, this method can achieve a set of policies that generate multi-modal trajectories. The experiments show that the proposed method can generate bimodal trajectories. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths\n\n* This paper tackles an important problem of learning policies that perform multi-modal behaviors.\n\n* The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can acquire policies that correspond to diverse behaviors.\n\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* The proposed method uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to approximate the state distribution. This may work on a small state space but would not scale to a high-dimensional state space, which is more practical. Moreover, this does not entail temporal information of the trajectory, which can limit its applicability to complex behaviors (e.g. loop).\n\n* There are some alternative approaches to achieve multi-modal behaviors without need for the simulator and task reward [a,b]. Discussion about comparisons to [a,b] would be great.\n\n* The tested environments and tasks are very simple -- 2D path planning with bimodal trajectories.\n\n* The experiments tested on datasets with only two modes. It would be great to verify the proposed method with more modes.\n\n* Instead of comparing with vanilla VAE, a comparison to VQ-VAE or VAE with a discrete latent space could be more appropriate since a quantized embedding in the proposed method can be the main source of generating multi-modal trajectories.\n\n* The paper claims that the proposed projection function provides the interpretable encoding value. However, the encodings shown in the paper are interpretable mainly because the experiments are done in 2D path planning. The proposed encoding will not be interpretable with the high-dimensional observations.\n\n* The proposed method assumes access to a simulator and a task reward, which limits its scalability to many applications.\n\n\n\n\n[a] Shafiullah et al.

Maybe a not suitable space can cause an undesirable outcome. The authors can make this part clearer. \n3. For a Post-hoc solution search (Fig. 10), a set of trajectories close to the demonstration are obtained, but the relative extent is not discussed. A comparison between similar methods can make your contributions outstanding.\n4. The authors proposed a method to find a potential solution from demonstrations. However, the authors should elaborate the application values. For example, learning from demonstrations in auto-driving technologies usually serves for human-like driving or driving safety. However, the treatment proposed in this study seemingly discusses a new approach without telling us what its meaning is. Following the descriptions of this study, the advantage is to find a solution through learning from demonstrations, but there have been many ways that can complete this.

In the problem formulation, the reward function needs to be parameterized in the preferences that the expert demonstrations are looking to encode. Eq.3 objective of matching state-visitation frequency under different preferences of the expert has also been well-studied in discrete spaces. Moreover, ,ean and mode seeking LfD is well-known in literature.\n\n- In continuous spaces, the hidden markov model/hidden semi-markov model is better suited to encode the temporal sequence in the state observations, as compared to the GMM (see [1]). Subsequently, Viterbi decoding can be used for generating diverse demonstrations.\n\n- There are no comparisons with other behavior cloning approaches to establish the merits of the approach.
