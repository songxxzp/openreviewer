            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose the DMITRI framework to generate dynamic embeddings for multi-entity interactions with timestamps. A multi-entity interaction involves potentially many types of entities, e.g. traffic type, severity, latitude, and longitude, and consists of a timestamped observation for those entities, such as the number of traffic accidents under those conditions at different times. The DMITRI framework uses an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model to learn embedding trajectories for each entity of each type. The authors consider both a diffusion process across multi-partite graphs, representing interactions between different types, and a reaction process for the individual entities. They demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy on 3 real datasets compared to a large number of existing methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- Proposed DMITRI framework generates dynamic embeddings for entities in continuous, rather than discrete time, unlike most existing dynamic tensor factorization approaches.\n- Use of neural ODEs to generate embeddings for multi-entity interactions appears to be novel.\n- Comparisons to a wide range of competing methods yields impressive predictive accuracy on 3 real datasets.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Minimal interpretations of the learned embedding trajectories. Beyond predicted observations, an additional output of DMITRI is the continuous-time embedding trajectories. The authors don't provide many interpretations of the trajectories, with only an example in Section 6.3.\n- No empirical results on computation time. The authors state that their approach is limited to a small number of entities due to the multi-partite graph approach for the diffusion process. I would have liked to see some experiments (perhaps in the supplementary material) comparing wall clock time to competing methods.\n\nQuestion:\n1. On page 4, you state that there are $K(K+1)/2$ adjacency matrices $\\mathbf{W}^{k,k'}$. Why $K(K+1)/2$ rather than $K(K-1)$? It appears that we can't have edges within the same type $k$, so no diagonal, and that there is no symmetry between $\\mathbf{W}^{k,k'}$ and $\\mathbf{W}^{k',k}$.\n\nTypo:\n- Page 6, second last paragraph: Unifrom\\[0,5\\] -> Uniform\\[0,5\\]",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity: High. I did have any problems understanding the paper.\n- Quality: High. The proposed DMITRI framework appears technically sound along with the experiments.\n- Novelty: High. I have not previously seen neural ODEs used to model multi-entity interactions. Additionally, continuous-time models in this area are rare yet potentially more powerful than discrete-time models.\n- Reproducibility: Low. No code is provided, and the experiments use sampled subsets of larger data sets, e.g. 10K interactions from the Server Room data. Without knowing how the 10K interactions were selected, it would be difficult to reproduce results.",
