[One feasible solution..., above section 3].\nAuthors say that it is suboptimal to divide the proposed task into two subtasks : 1) the nearest frame retrieval and 2) local registration.  However, authors still follow this pipeline by first performing KNN submap retrieval and then do local registration.\nThe difference could be authors use an attention-based context aggregation module to extract better global features.\nAccording to the above analysis, I would expect the following three experiments:\n1) Substitute the proposed submap retrieval [Sec.3.3] with a state-of-the-art nearest frame retrieval method [e.g., https://github.com/jac99/MinkLoc3Dv2], and keep the remaining modules to test the proposed method;\n2) Use a state-of-the-art nearest frame retrieval method for state-of-the-art methods to find a local submap for a query, and then test the performance of state-of-the-art methods;\n3) Use the proposed submap retrieval [Sec.3.3]  for baseline methods to find a local submap for a query, and then test the performance of state-of-the-art methods;\n\nThe above three experiments (ablations) can help readers get a clear picture of the proposed method and identifying what is actually working.\n\n2.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new point cloud registration method considering an unbalanced pair of point clouds. The main assumption is that one of them contains much fewer points than the other and represents only a part of the scene in interest. There are several spatial levels as well as the corresponding matching modules in the proposed method. The points are downsampled to super points, which are then again grouped into several submaps. The point and super-point features are calculated by a KPConv-based network, and they are aggregated using attention to calculate those for submaps. These features are used in a hierarchical matching process comprised of submap matching, super point matching, and finally point matching. An additional RANSAC procedure is applied to the point correspondences to refine the results. Experiments show that the proposed method beats the existing methods by a large margin for a new dataset created considering the particular problem setting proposed in the paper, and it is competitive for existing datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The main motivation of the paper, unbalanced point cloud pairs, is a plausible problem setting that can be important for practical scenarios. Although many corners of the proposed method are inspired by existing techniques in the literature, they are combined in a way that the above problem can be solved effectively. The proposed method provides good performance in the experiment which is also a good point.\n\nHowever, I also think that the proposed method has a limitation in its design. It seems that Y (the query) is assumed to be almost a subset of X. Unlike X, Y has only a single submap, which is matched with various submaps of X, as if we are searching for a part of X that corresponds to Y. However, a more general situation is when X and Y are only partially overlapped, and a large part of Y is also absent in X. Of course, I see that the authors are considering unmatched super points for both directions in (6), but I still somewhat doubt the choice of having a single submap for Y. It seems that this design simplifies the problem too much. I'd like to hear the authors' justification regarding this part.\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "One of the main issues I have with the paper is that the writing can be improved. Many parts are hard to follow or missing important details:\n- For example, How is S_i determined exactly? Here, v is learnable, and yet the intersection between different submaps is constrained to be 0.5. How is this exactly achieved?\n- In Appendix, the calculation of compatibility coherence is only briefly explained. Here, it says that the coherence is calculated by multiplying the compatibility matrix, but multiplying it with what?\n- In Section 3.3., global features are calculated based on generalized mean pooling. Does this mean that F'_{x'_j}(k) is positive?\n\nThe proposed method is designed with many different small components, but the details are not 100% clearly explained in the paper. Therefore, I believe more information (such as the source code) is needed to reproduce the results.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper proposes an important problem that often arises in practical scenarios, and achieves good performance in the experiment. However, I also have a doubt about its method design (regarding the treatment of Y). Moreover, many important details are missing or confusingly described in the paper.\n\n[After rebuttal] I'm satisfied with the answers regarding my original concerns. However, I agree with g5jK regarding the fairness of the experiments, which is a non-negligible concern. Accordingly, I decrease my score to 5.",

The proposed UPPNet mainly consists of three modules: submap matching, super-point matching, and point matching. The submap matching module aims to retrieval the most similar set of target points from the global 3D map for the source local scan. For the source local scan and the retrieved target point cloud, the super-point matching and point matching modules are progressively performed to achieve pair-wise registration.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "#Strenths#\nThis paper is well written and easy to follow.\n#Weakness#\nThe major faults of this paper lie in the experiment part, which can be summarized as:\n(1)\tThe starting point of this paper is inappropriate. Since this work considers the registration between a local 3D scan and a global 3D map, this experimental setup actually lies in the category of relocalization. However, no experiment is provided to compare the proposed UPPNet with existing relocalization methods.\n(2)\tThe authors conduct extensive experiments to compare the proposed UPPNet with the pair-wise registration methods. However, the experimental setup in this paper is unfair and different from the original setting of pair-wise registration. Pair-wise registration is mainly used to align a captured 3D scan with another 3D scan instead of the reconstructed 3D map.\n(3)\tThe authors mention the limitations of the paradigm of retrieval-to-registration in related work. However, there are no specific experiments to demonstration these claims. In fact, the proposed UPPNet is an end-to-end implementation of this paradigm and does not really addressed these limitations.\n\nAdditional comparative experiments are expected to demonstrate the motivation of this work, such as:\n(1) Compare the registration performance of the proposed UPPNet with relocalization methods (such as DH3D [1]) rather than pair-wise registration methods.\n(2) Conduct extensive experiments to compare the proposed UPPNet with the state-of-the-art combinations of retrieval-then-registration (such as MinkLoc3D + Geotransformer[2]).\n\nIn addition, in the implementation details in Appendix, the authors claim that the voxel size is set to 1m. I have two questions about this:\n(1) Is this setting also the same on the indoor 3DMatch/3DLoMatch dataset? On the indoor dataset, only the registrations with RMSE < 0.2m are considered for the calculation of Registration Recall. If the voxel size is set to 1m, I think it is difficult to achieve such a high RR in Table 1.\n(2) In original pair-wise registration papers, the values of voxel sizes on 3DMatch and KITTI are 0.03m and 0.3m, respectively. According to the visualization results, this setting is reasonable. But in this paper, in order to reduce memory consumption and improve computation efficiency, the voxel size is set to 1m, which not only loses a lot of geometric information, but also is extremely unfair to the pair-wise registration methods.\n\n[1] Du J, Wang R, Cremers D.
