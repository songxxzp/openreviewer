            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a new learning-based heuristic, named NeuroCROSS, to solve several routing problems. Unlike the previously learned intra-operations like 2-opt and swap, the proposed NeuroCROSS is an inter-operation between two routes, which requires different learning task formulation and neural network design. The proposed method utilizes a supervised learning formulation to predict the best cost-decrement based on two starting nodes and thus reduce the complexity. Several numerical experiments are conducted, and the proposed method outperforms meta-heuristic baselines and neural baselines.  \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n- The proposed NeuroCROSS is reasonable to reduce the complexity of CE operation.\n- The experimental results show the proposed method has favorable performance on both medium-sized and large-sized instances and can be generalized to similar problems.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- There has been many works trying to learn heurisitcs (using reinforcement learning or supervised learning) for combinatorial optimization. This work is just another piece of standard implemention, using supervised learning. Indeed I did not find any new insight. \n\n- The design to search two starting nodes by prediction is too heuristic. There are four nodes to search in the CE operation, but the reason why to select the two starting nodes for prediction is not well-explained. \n\n- The generalization performance on different instance-generation distributions is not validated in the paper. The customer nodes of all the training and testing instances are generated by uniform distribution. The authors should verify the generalization performance on other distributions such as explosion, implosion, and so on [1].\n\n[1] Jiang Y, Wu Y, Cao Z, et al.

The idea of connection (estimating the value function of the heuristic) is interesting on its own. \n\nWeakness:\n\nNCE is only evaluated on a single configuration in Table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Since NCE is much more expensive than Greedy/Greedy+TSP, it would be interesting to see the entire compute cost vs. gap curve for both these baselines and the proposed NCE method. \n\nEvaluation is only on synthetic datasets, which limits our understanding on how the method would perform in real-world problems.",

Authors follow a principled methodology, and evaluates across a good range of problems & baselines.\n\nNovelty: The idea of approximating a value/cost function in a heuristic with a neural network model is not particularly new, but the particular idea of splitting the decision to two pieces (choose one ends of the route first, and then choose the other ends exactly) is new; this strategy would generalize to other meta-heuristics.\n\n(Question 1: could we choose (a1, b2) instead of (a1, b1)? Question 2: could we reduce the compute time from O(n^2) to O(n) by choosing one end of one route at a time?)\n\nReproducibility: Authors mostly use synthetic data.
