            "summary_of_the_paper": "The manuscript proposes to tackle the imbalanced class distribution in semi-supervised learning. Motivated by the overfit on minority class, the author introduce a game model with three players, namely discrimintor D, generator G and Predictor C. In the training, being different with normal GAN pipeline, a new game between D and C is also introduced. Then, extensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate the superior results.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The three-players game for GAN seems to be new, as far as I am concerned.\n2. The manuscript has closed form, in which the motivation, proposal and demonstration are all mentioned, despite that some of them are not clarified.\n\nWeakness(Issues):\n1. The motivation is confusing. What is the relationship between the paper with disease? The introduction is filled with rare disease detection, but the conducted datasets are all related to text. I think the authors didn' t get how to write an acdemic paper.\n2. The reason for introducing the predictor C is missed. As shown in introduction, the manuscript is to tackle the unbalancedly distributed class, then, how the C tackles the issue? Why maximizing distance between C with D faciliates the training on rare class?\n3. How the G in the manuscript tackles the bias generation of normal G in GAN? Why the G in this paper wouldn' t be influenced by class bias?\n4. The draft is not qualified. The figures and typesetting need to be further improved.\n5. The necessary analysis in experiments are missed. For example, the demonstration for adopted datasets. What' s the real ratio of positive samples in the dataset? \n6. The conclusion is weak. The author focus on comparing with GAN. Despite that GAN is actually the most related work to the manuscript, the motivation is on addressing unbalanced class in semi-supervised learning. There lacks elaboration on that point.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The Clarity and Quality are very poor, see Weakness. As for the novelty, since the proposed three-players in a Game seems to be novel, it can be concluded as a contribution. In the light of Reproducibility, the manuscript is totally designed based on empirical intuition, but  I didn' t find code or traing log, so I cannot judge it.",

Adversarially trained classifier.\n- It is unclear why the discriminator needs to maximize the distance between the predictions from D and C.\n- Would be good to clarify the motivations of this loss.\n- Also, why is the adversarially trained classifier useful for correct predictions on the unlabeled data?\n- How to extract data from the unlabeled data using C?\n\n3. Paper writing\n- The paper writing can be significantly improved. Many details are missing.\n- So, at the end, the authors use D? or C?\n- How to train the model with extracted minorities from unlabeled data?\n\n4. Other data domain\n- Based on the description, the proposed method (PGASL) can be applicable to any type of data.\n- In that point of view, it would be good to have other results with other data domains in addition to text data. (Such as tabular data like fraud detection)\n- As the authors mentioned, a rare disease dataset would be one of the possible datasets.\n\n5. Generative models for generating minority samples\n- If the number of minority samples are limited, how can we train the reasonable generative model that can generate those minority samples?\n\n6. Experiments\n- It would be interesting if the authors show the performance with different values of \\rho (labeled: unlabeled data ratios).\n- TSNE results seem somewhat confused. Some purble samples are actually out of distribution space.\n\n7. Etc.\n- Any insights that a larger dropout ratio on C is better?\n- Typo in l^*_{un} equation. No equal sign",
