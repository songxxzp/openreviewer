            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n---\n\nTime series forecasting is a crucial problem across many application domains \u2013 with many datasets exhibiting level-trend-seasonality relationships in general. The development of models which can capture these relationships better would be very impactful for said applications.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n---\n\nHowever, I do have several key concerns with the paper:\n\n1. The paper does adopt some seemingly non-standard terms, which can be confusing with similar terms in general time series forecasting/representation learning literature.\n\n     a.\tIrregularity \u2013 the paper frequently describes residuals as \u201cthe irregularity\u201d, without defining the term concretely or citing its source. Easily confused with modelling irregularly sampled time series \u2013 e.g. ICML 2022\u2019s Modelling Irregular Time Series with Continuous Recurrent Units.\n\n     b.\tReflection \u2013 appears to be used synonymously with \u201cmodel\u201d, and could be confused with concepts in vector transformations (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(mathematics)).\n\n2. I am not sure I fully understand the motivations behind the architecture\n\n     a.\tEven if we were to understand \u201cirregularity\u201d as \u201cresidual\u201d, the underlying model itself appears to be feeding in the inputs as-is \u2013 without any residualisation with respect to level-trend-seasonal components as implied by the summary.\n\n     b.\tThe analogy of the IRN as a non-linear Fourier transform appears to breakdown when actual non-time inputs are used (i.e. x_input) \u2013 i.e. feeding a exogenous input into a sine wave would not necessarily make it a periodic basis function unless it is monotonic.\n\n     c.\tThe description of the Fourier transform is also slightly unclear in equation 3\n\n          i. Assuming $t_{a\\~b}$ is a single point in time -- as implied by \u201cWhen the irregularity \u2026 is observed at moment $t_{a\\~b}$\u201d \u2013 $min(t_{a\\~b})$ becomes unmeaningful as it would simply equal $t_{a~b}$. If it represents a sequence, then sin(\u2026) becomes non-meaningful.\n\n     d. The parallels when we move into input space in equation 6 also require further explanation:\n\n         i. Does dim(x^{input}) have to match dim(x^{irregular})? What if we only have a single input?\n\n         ii. \u201cThrough this transformation, x^{irregular} is converted from time dependent to data dependent.\u201d, but x^{input} does not appear to be a time index of any sort? Otherwise does dim d=1?\n\n     e. How is the IRB used to generate multi-step forecasts in the table?\n\n     f. How is hyperparameter optimisation performed for the model and benchmarks \u2013 details of which are crucial for reproducibility.\n\n3. Unclear problem formulation \u2013 while the paper seemingly implies that the problem being tackled is for improving multi-horizon forecasts for datasets with strong level/trend/seasonal relationships, the precise problem is never fully defined. This makes it difficult to determine the appropriateness of the proposed benchmarks \u2013 many of which come from long-term time series forecasting (e.g. LogTran/Reformer/Pyraformer/Autoformer). Even with the simpler models \u2013 e.g. LSTM/GRU/VAR-MLP etc \u2013 how were they applied for multi-horizon forecasts?\n\n     i. Assuming the paper is tackling models for enhanced level/trend/seasonality modelling \u2013 many existing papers do exist in the area that should be compared against (e.g ESRNN, Deep factors for forecasting etc) alongside simple econometric ETS models.\n\n     ii. Assuming the paper is tackling models which used frequency-domain-based representations to improve time series forecasting, it should be compared against models such at the FEDformer for consistency.\n",
