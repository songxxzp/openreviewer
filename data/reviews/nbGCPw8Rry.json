Specifically, a spare biological pathway-informed embedding network (Han et al., 2018; Elmarakeby et al., 2021) is used to deal with genomic data to reveal meaningful biological interpretations. To capture modality-specific information, the authors used bilinear pooling (Yu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2022), which provides richer representations than linear models. For multi-modal fusion, the idea from ARGF (Mai et al., 2020) is borrowed to assign attentions to identify the importance of cross-modal representations. On six cancer datasets from TCGA, PONET achieves performance improves over previous multi-modal survival prediction methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "$Strengths$:\n\nOverall, the descriptions of proposed PONET are clear and easy to understand. Lots of implementation details are included, making the proposed method easy to understand and improving the reproducibility. Pathway-based analysis is an interesting and promising direction for improving both predictive performance and biological interpretability. Besides, I appreciate the efforts made in visualizing the co-attention results.\n\n$Weaknesses$:\n\n1. The novelty is limited from perspectives of ideas and techniques. Multi-modal survival analysis is not a new idea (Mobadersany et al., 2018; Cheerla & Gevaert, 2019; Wang et al., 2020). Biological pathway-informed network has been used in similar problems (Han et al., 2018; Elmarakeby et al., 2021). The idea of attention-based multi-modal fusion methodology is borrowed from ARGF (Mai et al., 2020). The limited technical novelty is also reflected in Table 1. Comparing PONET with PONET-OH, we can draw a conclusion that the performance advantages of PONET mainly orginate from the incorporation of the pathway architecture. However, the pathway architecture has been used in similar problems (Han et al., 2018; Elmarakeby et al., 2021), and the authors did not mention the technical differences between their implementation and previous versions (Han et al., 2018; Elmarakeby et al., 2021), both of which weaken the technical contributions of PONET. Besides, I think the implementation details  of the sparse pathway network should be clarified in the main text instead of the appendix considering it is one of the core contributions. \n\n2. Phrases like \"Unimodal Fusion\" and \"Trimodal Fusion\" are misleading and may exaggerate the contributions of this paper. \"Unimodal Fusion\" actually is equivalent to a feature embedding process, where the factorized multi-modal bilinear pooling (Yu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2022) is used to produce rich representations. Since it contains no interactions among different modalities, the use of \"Fusion\" is incorrect and misleading. A more appropriate name should be like \"Unimodal Embedding\". A similar problem also exists in \"Trimodal Fusion\", where the authors only apply the bimodal fusion strategy again. Personally, I recommend merging sec. 4.3 Bimodal Fusion and sec. 4.4 Trimodal Fusion into a single section as their operations are almost the same.\n\n3. Experimental results are not sufficient. Since this paper heavily borrows the idea (i.e., hierarchical and attentional fusion) from ARGF (Mai et al., 2020) for multi-modal fusion, it is necessary to compare PONET with ARGF in the experiment section. However, I do not see any results of ARGF in the submission.  Besides, as shown in Table 2, bimodal and trimodal fusion are very useful. However, PONET only contains on bimodal fusion layer and one trimodal fusion layer. So, how about stacking more fusion layers? Also, the implementation details of single-fusion methods are not clarified, making the ablation results less convincing.\n\nMinor points.\n\n1. Notations of dimensions. For clarification, $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ should be $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times 1}$. $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ should be $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times 1}$.\n\n2. In sec. 4.1, $m_1$, $m_2$ $\\in (p, c, g)$ should be $m_1$, $m_2$ $\\in$ {$p, c, g$}.\n\n3. In sec. 4.3, \"If two information vectors are close to each other, then little complementary information lies between them and their information has been well explored in the unimodal fusion.\" The use of \"close\" is inaccurate, how do you define the closeness between vectors? In addition, the unimodal fusion never explores the complementary information between two modalities' vectors regardless of their  similarity. Thus, the above statement should be rephrases.\n\n4. All formulas need to be numbered.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "$Clarity\\ and\\ Quality$:\n\nSome phrases (names of modules) and statements need to modified. Overall, the paper writing is good and the contents are easy to understands. Few typos exist in the draft.\n\n$Novelty$:\n\nMy major concern lies in the novelty. In my view, this paper neither proposes a novel pipeline for multi-modal survival prediction nor develops new modules for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, biological pathway-informed network has been used in similar problems (Han et al., 2018; Elmarakeby et al., 2021). The idea of hierarchical multi-modal fusion is borrowed from ARGF (Mai et al., 2020). \n\n$Reproducibility$:\n\nLots of implementation details are provided. It is possible to reproduce the proposed method based on textual descriptions.\n\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Deep Biological Pathway Informed Pathology-Genomic Multimodal Survival Prediction\n\nThe manuscript proposes a multi-model data integration method for survival prediction. The method, called PONET, integrates gene expressions, pathology image features and copy number and mutation data using the multi-model low-rank bilinear pooling (MLB, implemented by SumPooling) which is a variant of the bilinear models.  Specifically, PONET extends the previous work HFBSurv [Li et al., 2022] to include the trimodal fusion (combining two bimodal fusion outputs) and the pathway structures for hidden layers. The experimental results show that the proposed methods work better for survival prediction in several cancer types in TCGA cohort. In addition, the methods provide biological interpretations (e.g., gene-pathway associations or image-pathway associations using co-attention visualization) \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n1. PONET shows the supervisor prediction performance over the base-line methods, including the Kronecker product-based fusion methods and the MLB-based method. In addition, the proposed methods, which are based on the MLB, have lower complexities compared to the Kronecker product-based fusion methods\n2. The methods provide biological interpretations which would be useful to identify new biomarkers markers from data. \n\nWeakness\n1. I did not see significant improvement in methodology when comparing the proposed methods to HFBsurv [Li et al., 2022]. It seems that all the main components (the way to fuse multi modalities, attention mechanism, and even all the main equations) are directly borrowed from the previous work.\n2. It is a little bit hard to understand the meanings of several points. I think that the paper needs to be revised. \nFor example, \n2-a) about the equation in the top of page 3, regarding the attention, requires the form of the attention. I don\u2019t think this is the standard attention module which is based on queries, keys and values.\n2-b) In the section 5.2 (comparison with Baselines), \u201cAll versions of PONET outperform Pathomic Fusion by ~\u201c. The authors listed two main reasons, but it seems that they need more explanations. For the reason 1, it sounds reasonable that the proposed methods, based on the MLB (low rank), are less computational completed than Pathomic. However, it is not clear why the MLB-based-methods are necessarily outperforms the Kronecker-product-based methods. For the reason 2, are the authors trying to compare both feature extraction methods, VIT and GCN? \n3. In the section 5.3, could the authors give more explanations about why discretization of Survival time can lead better performance for certain cancer types.\n4. Regarding Figure 3-b. It is not clear how co-attention visualization was done. I thought that it could be done by postprocessing the outputs of the trained PONET. However, the appendix just includes a reference method. Could the author elaborate this process in the manuscript? \n5. Figure 1 and the experiments. What kind of the pathway database is used to model the PONET pathway structure? I can see how the layer H1 (genes) and H2 (pathways) are structured (the pathway database indicates the member genes of each pathway), but don\u2019t understand how to build the layers H3 and H4. These kinds of information should be included in the text. \n6. I think the manuscript needs a careful proofreading. Some minor types grammatic errors. For example, in Page 3, \u201cUnlike our proposed PONET can\u201d might be \u201cwhich\u201c was missing here?\n",
