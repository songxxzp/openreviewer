Specifically, an adaptive graph Transformer is first designed to learn the cross-channel relationships in MTS. To model the stochasticity, a channel embedding guided probabilistic generative module is further proposed. Lastly, the authors propose an autoencoding inference scheme that combines prediction and reconstruction loss for better representation learning. Experiments on the time series forecasting and anomaly detection task demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

The experiments verify the effectiveness of the method.\n\nCons:\n1. I suggest that the author should further clarify the first contribution (i.e., the G-Trans module). Since incorporating relationship learning between different time series have actually been explored by many works in the field of spatial-temporal forecasting. What\u2019s the difference in the proposed G-Trans ? \n2. The term \u201cdynamic\u201d is mentioned many times in the paper, with no clear explanation. For example, in related works, \u201cHowever, these methods are still all non-dynamic or RNN based models, limiting their power in capturing complex relationships across long-distance time steps\u201d\n3. The authors claim that \u201cVG-Trans is able to get the robust representation of MTS\u201d. How to prove it?\n4. In Figure 2(c), the authors use Graph Convolution network to replace the first Feed Forward Network, by stating that GCN can better capture the diverse relationship than FFN. If so, why not use GCN to replace all FFN in Transformer? Will the result get better by doing so?\n",

The proposed approach performs better in anomaly detection and time series forecasting tasks compared to some baselines.\n\nWeaknesses: \n\n--Some claims and motivations lack theoretical support or explanation.

It is a natural idea to use graph structure in time series, and many works have tried, such as \n[1] Graph neural network-based anomaly detection in multivariate time series, in: Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021.\n[2] MST-GAT: A multimodal spatial\u2013temporal graph attention network for time series anomaly detection. Information Fusion 2023.\nJust changing RNN to Transformer is not inspiring.\n\n--The motivation for using probabilistic modeling and variational inference is also unclear, and no experimental results have shown the existence of stochasticity and the advantage of elimination it. \n\n--The experimental comparison is still superficial, and only focuses on whether the performance is improved, without in-depth analysis and experimental verification of the claimed assumptions about the advantage of modeling channel relationship and modeling stochasticity.",
