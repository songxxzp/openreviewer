Why not use an existing benchmark like PHYRE/TOOLS if the focus is on proposing a new planning framework? Are event trees not applicable to PHYRE/TOOLS benchmarks? If not, then perhaps the proposed approach is too tailored to the proposed benchmark.\n2. Could we apply a standard planner like CEM on event-trees?\n3. Very little information about the forward model is provided. Can event-based world models be learned directly from pixels similarly to how we learn latent-variable temporal generative models e.g. RSSM [1]?\n\n[1] Hafner, Danijar et al. \u201cLearning Latent Dynamics for Planning from Pixels.\u201d",

            "summary_of_the_review": "The general idea of an event-based world model and the idea of planning in it is very interesting. But I feel that the paper is taking too many steps simultaneously and thus making it difficult to strongly claim any one contribution. For instance, it is hard to judge the value of event trees if the evaluation is done on a new benchmark also proposed in the same paper. Similarly, it is hard to judge the value of event trees if the planning is done by a newly proposed planning algorithm rather than some standard and well-known planner.",

Specifically, they propose a relatively simple simulation environment as a testbed for this problem - an agent observes a physical world with several moving and static objects and then manipulates the direction and speed of the purple ball to satisfy the complex set of constraints given by the instruction. They define the problem as a supervised learning setup, and then propose a method that uses tree search for modeling the forward process and employs machine learning to learn to search effectively in the exponential space. They present the superior performance of their method compared to several baseline models. They also provide various ablation studies and a human evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Although I am not an expert on this problem of modeling cascading process, this paper is generally well-written and understandable to me. The following reviews are from the perspective of a person with general machine learning background.\n\nStrengths:\n1. This paper provides a precise formulation of the cascading process and the problem setup of making interventions in such systems.\n2. They provide a testbed for this problem. Despite being simulated, it's a decent setup that people can follow and study the problem in a controlled and plausible way.\n3. The method they proposed looks reasonable to me. They also compare with a bunch of baselines, some of which were proposed recently. So, the comparison looks convincing.\n4. Regarding the experiments, they provide relatively comprehensive ablation studies and demonstration cases, which I think verifies their claims.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The scope of the cascading process can be very large, while the paper only focuses on a relatively simple simulation environment. It would be better to avoid overclaiming in the title or introduction.\n2.  Although using the simulation environment is a reasonable setup right now, it's unclear how the studies in this toy setup can generalize to real-world scenarios. It might worth discussing at the end of the paper.",
