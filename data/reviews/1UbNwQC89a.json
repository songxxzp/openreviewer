By using the GAN-Inversion, the author achieves better results on non-mask image inpainting scenarios, which help the classical image inpainting problems overcome a challenging obstacle. \n2. I know that for image inpainting problems, the guys always overfit their module some specified scenarios, and show very promising results on some test data with similar properties. Yeh etal is just like this. I am not sure whether this method is still in this way. If they still solve this problem in this manner and show poor generalization ability to other scenarios, I donot think the GAN-Inversion is a big plus. \n3. To relive my concern, please provide more details in the rebuttal about the details of training data, for example, if you want to get the result on CELEBA dataset, do you need to use similar data to train your network for the generative image prior?\n4. Is it ok to show more results beyond current established dataset? \n5. Is it ok to provide more details about Figure 2? From the figure, this work still relies on some kinds of mask to achieve the results, though this mask is not explicitly obtained. However, considering the examples in this figure, where the mask is with significant differences to its surrounding regions, it may not be very difficult to estimate such a mask. \n6.

Similar ideas can also be found in paper [1], while the authors of that inpainting paper proposed to jointly optimize the mask and reconstruction loss during training.  \n- It would be interesting to study whether we can learn the regional GAN-inversion by matching partial generated images with the ground truth. For example, whether we can optimize the inversion network to only extract the foreground objects or salient objects. It may be an interesting extension of this work. \n- Finetunning the generator may be not that practical for real applications. \n\n[1] Zeng, Yu, et al. \"High-resolution image inpainting with iterative confidence feedback and guided upsampling.\" European conference on computer vision.

Or the problems are not about the synthetic dataset, but the synthetic data (center block / random pixel missing) in this paper is not that realistic and diverse to reveal the advantages of the proposed method.\n- The evaluation is poor, especially for the mask-free inpainting tasks. Baselines are weak, and the metrics are not advanced to demonstrate the visual quality. For GAN-based generation, at least LPIPS/FID should also be reported. \n- More interesting topics like partial GAN-inversion should be explored to prove the robustness. ",

This paper presents two theorems for robust RGI that provides the theoretical foundation for the optimization formulation of the proposed algorithm.\n3. Experimental results by applying the proposed RGI and R-RGI methods to two application problems on some public datasets are shown with promising results.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The proposed RGI or R-RGI methods require to solve the large optimization problems during the inference. There is no discussion on the computational cost involved in solving the large optimization problems during the inference. It could be very computationally infeasible for practical application.\n\n2. Another limitation with the GAN inversion approach is that it requires a large number of normal images to train a GAN model for the specific task. In many cases, there are not enough numbers of normal images for training the GAN models. In their experiments on image inpainting, the datasets used in the experiments are CelebA, Standard cars, and LSUN bedroom all contain very large numbers of images for the GAN model training. But for MVTec and BTAD datasets, the numbers of training images are not a lot. There is no discussion on the numbers of images used in the model training for the implementation on anomaly detection experiments. There should be more discussion on the issue of training data requirement for the proposed method.\n\n3. The experiments on pixel-wise anomaly detection are only performed on their synthetic defect dataset based on BTAD dataset. The experimental evaluation is not sufficient to demonstrate the proposed RGI or R-RGI achieve SOTA performance for anomaly detection. They should perform experiments with the standard protocol on the commonly used datasets, such as MVTec and BTAD datasets and include experimental comparison with some recent SOTA methods.\n\n4. The discussion in section 3.3 claims the proposed RGI method is connected to robust statistics and the loss function in eq. 3 can be simplified by using the robust error function, which avoids introducing M in the loss function. However, there is no justification of this claim. If this is the case, is the resulting optimization problem also simpler to solve? ",
