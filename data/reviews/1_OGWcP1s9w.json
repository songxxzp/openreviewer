Graphair consists of three major components: (1) automated graph augmentation, (2) adversarial training, (3) contrastive training. Experiments are conducted to show that the proposed framework achieves a better fairness-accuracy trade-off compared to the baseline methods.",

The proposed method achieves SOTA performance.\n\n4. The overall presentation is good.\n\n\n[Weakness]\n\nI have no significant concerns about the paper. However, I believe the experiment section can be improved.\n\n1. Some details of experiments are missing. E,g., which model is used for the classifier?\n\n\n2. The baselines can be strengthened by including SOTA method for fairness-aware graph learning, i.e., FairGNN [Dai & Wang, 2021].\nAlthough FairGNN directly uses the class label in its training, I believe it can still be compared with the proposed method.\nAlso, I think that investigating the benefits of augmentation in cases where only a small portion of sensitive attributes is available (as done in [Dai & Wang, 2021]) can better support the significance of the proposed method.\n",

The adoption of adversarial training for fairness property is also interesting (but for this part I'm not sure if similar things have appeared in other literatures or not). \n\nThe proofs of the two theorems are somewhat standard to me. This is not bad because I didn't see the claim on theoretical innovations. For experiments, the datasets used are relatively small. Maybe additional results on larger synthetic data will also be interesting together with discussions on the scalability of the proposed method.",

Graphair is designed to automatically discover fairness-aware augmentations from input graphs in order to circumvent sensitive information while preserving other informative features. Adversarial learning and contrastive learning are adopted to achieve fairness and informativeness simultaneously in the augmented graphs. Empirical results indicate that Graphair outperforms several recent baselines on node classification tasks in terms of fairness-accuracy trade-off performance.",

The method proposed in the paper does not require some strong assumptions or definitions about the properties that fair graph data should have, while most existing methods rely on these assumptions which may vary significantly in different scenarios.\n\n2. According to the experiments, the method achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art methods on node classification tasks on three datasets while significantly improves the fairness, and outperforms several baselines on the fairness-accuracy trade-off performance.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. There are only limited results on how the method affects the graph topology. Apart from the case study presented in the appendix, more experimental results are expected on the comparison of changes in graph structure after the augmentations.\n\n2. (This limitation has been addressed in the appendix. It would be better to also mention this in the main part.) Because Graphair has a space complexity of O(n^2) in the full-batch setting, it is expensive to train Graphair on large graph datasets, mini-batch is required to reduce space complexity.\n",

As for originality, the paper includes necessary related works and how the proposed method is different from these recent works.\nThere are only minor issues in the presentation of results:\n1. In Figure 8: it is a bit difficult to distinguish the color of original edges (black) and additional edges (green).\n2. In Equations (3) and (4): Bernoulli distribution takes a single probability as the parameter, it would be better to express how to get A' and Z' in an elementwise form (e.g., $A'_{ij} =$).\n",

The empirical results are not convincing enough. If no public datasets are available, maybe the authors can consider evaluate on some larger scale synthetic datasets. This would also help showing the scalability of the proposed method, especially considering the current datasets are pretty small with 60k nodes max. \n\nw2.
