Can you explain the procedure with rigorous mathematical formuals if necessary? Also, why the Table 1 implies that AT focuses on low-frequency region? The robust model performs best for the highest bandwidth\n- In Table 1, how is the last column evaluated by the learned model?\n- The empirical results are not significant.\n- The experimental setup for Tabel 3 is not well explained.\n- WA can be applied to other adversarial algorithms. Thus, comparing the performance AT+FR/WA with other competitors is not fair. For fair comparison, WA should be applied to others.\n- It seems that the result of AWP [2] in Table 3 is not reliable. The original paper reports the robust accuracy against AA is about 56. The 2% degration of performance in AutoAttack is largely significant. Can you explain about it?\n- There is not enough explanation for model selection in the evalution setting.\n- In eqn (2), what is the exact form of \\mathcal{L}_{ce}? Does it depends on  f_1, f_2 or other f?\n- In eqn (2), how can you find  in the regularization term? Is PGD in AT [1]? What is target model for finding \\delta, f_1, f_2 or other model?\n- In eqn (2), what \\mathcal{F}(f_1(x)) means? It seems the outputs of FFT in logits. I'm confused what it means to apply FFT to logits. My understanding is that FFT is applied to data.\n- The frequency regularization is not limited AT [1]. It can be extended to other algorithm such as TRADES. Can you present the results for other algorithms?\n- I'm confused about what the L-model is.

Thus, it is not necessary to provide toy examples for this point, i.e., Section 3.2 could be largely reduce.\n- some researchers think that it is better to use more flexible model for AT, since essentially we have two distributions to fit. In this point of view, it is better to enhance the flexibility, not to restrict it by regularization. Maybe for small model, regularization helps but for large model it becomes useless. I would like to know the opinion of the authors and if there are additional experiments on large model, it will be great. \n- AT is actually a trade-off between natural and adversarial samples.
