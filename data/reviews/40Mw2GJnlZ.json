This is achieved by conducting a Fourier analysis of strong boundary condition PINNs where a specific boundary condition is used. The result is that multiplying the neural network with the boundary function should enable a faster and more accurate learning of the coefficients. The findings are tested on small synthetic datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\nThe paper identifies one specific problem of PINNs (capturing high-frequency information) via Fourier analysis on strong BC PINNs, which is quite neat.  \n\nWeaknesses:\nAll the experiments are rather toy-like, and thus it is hard to judge how well the proposed method works. I would like to see at least one temporal PDE, and also some standard PDE problems to test if the approach is still valid there are harms the PINN performance on any other problem besides the toy problems. Which f(x) is needed to get the true solutions outlined in the paper?\nPINNs are known for having problems with high-frequency information, there is tons of work on that. Would it be possible to put that into better perspective, both method-wise and comparison-wise? I doubt that RFF PINNs are the only competitors here?\nI am missing details on the training behavior of the FourierPINNs, again hard to judge if notorious problems in PINN training can be alleviated by this approach or if they get worse.\nOne claim of the paper is that FourierPINNs achieve a \u201cfaster and more accurate learning of coefficients of higher frequencies\u201d, yet there is nothing in the experiment section which supports the \u201cfaster\u201d claim.\nAgain experiments, I would have liked to see experiments for multiple inputs.\n",

By modeling\nthe solution as an neural network plus the linear combination of a set of dense\nFourier bases, authors developed Fourier PINNs. Finally, authors evaluated Fourier\nPINNs in several benchmark PDEs with high-frequency and multi-frequency solutions\nand solutions that couple high-frequency components with plain functions. In\nall the cases, Fourier PINNs consistently achieve good solution errors.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Both strong boundary condition PINNs and Fourier PINNs achieve good errors in numerical experiments and provide new ideas for solving PDEs with high-frequency and multifrequency\nsolutions. While the author's approaches are interesting, there are some weaknesses should be pointed out.\n1. The main idea of strong boundary condition PINNs is to construct the solution with\n$$\n\\widetilde{u}_{\\theta}(x)=B(x)\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}(x),\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_{\\theta}(x)$ is a neural network parameterized by $\\theta$, and $B|_{\\partial\\Omega}=0$. This approach use be used in penalty-free neural network (PFNN), see Shen and Yang 2021. \n2. Furthermore, PFNN extended this approach to complex geometries and nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions.\n As we all known, $\\{\\cos(\\pi nx)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ (or $\\{1\\}\\cup\\{\\sin(\\pi nx)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$) is an orthogonal basis of $L^{2}(0,1)$, which means that any function in $L^{2}(0,1)$ can be written as a liner combination of $\\{\\cos(\\pi nx)\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ (or $\\{1\\}\\cup\\{\\sin(\\pi nx)\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$). The authors should interpret the motivation of using the NN basis in (10) or (11).\n3.  Removing the linear combination of NN basis in (10) or (11) yields the spectral methods. In fact, we only need to solve a least square problem in spectral methods, but need to solve non-convex optimization problems many times in Fourier PINNs. I recommend the authors to explain the advantages of Fourier PINNs comparing with the spectral methods.\n\nRef:\nHailong Sheng and Chao Yang.

There exists plenty of room to improve the quality of the paper at this point, and as such the manuscript should not be published in the present form.\n",
