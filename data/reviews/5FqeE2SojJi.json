            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposed a data augmentation method PASTA for syn2real generalization. Based on the finding that real images exhibit larger high frequency variances than synthetic ones, PASTA perturbs the high frequency bands of the amplitude spectrum of the synthetic images. In doing so, the high frequency variance is larger while the semantic content is preserved. This augmentation scheme is applicable to different tasks. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. Simple approach but rather effective compared with some more complex methods.\n2. The effectiveness is showed across different tasks, e.g., semantic segmentation, object detection.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Frequency domain augmentation is an existing augmentation strategy, see listed papers below. It is also reviewed in the related work of this paper. However, there generally miss direct comparison with data augmentation schemes, especially those which are also based on spectrum perturbation. In the paper, the authors mainly compared with one and reported the number in the text for a single task. This is far from sufficient.\n2. The perturbation design is rather hand-crafted. It's also sensitive to hyperparameters such as alpha, k, and beta(also mentioned in the limitations). Therefore, without comprehensive comparisons with prior work on frequency domain augmentation, PASTA is not a convincing new solution.\n3. The scheme is more effective in SemSeg, whereas the performance in object detection is not convincing. \n4. There are multiple questionable places in the experiment part:\n- In Tab. 1-d), it is strange why a larger backbone would cause worse performance. \n- For SemSeg in Tab 1, it is also unclear why the authors did not choose the best performing method WildNet as the baseline and apply PASTA with it for a better generalization performance. \n- The in-distribution performance is not provided in Table 1. \n- From Table 2, PASTA (obviously)  hurts the ID performance. Is this always the case and any explanation for this?\n\nPapers related to frequency domain augmentation:\n- Amplitude-Phase Recombination: Rethinking Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks in Frequency Domain\n- Frequency Spectrum Augmentation Consistency for Domain Adaptive Object Detection\n- Domain Generalization via Frequency-domain-based Feature Disentanglement and Interaction\n- Amplitude Spectrum Transformation for Open Compound Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation\n- A Fourier-based Framework for Domain Generalization\n\n",

Here, an augmented image is generated by perturbing the synthesized image, wherein the perturbed signal is selected from a normal distribution having a large standard deviation in proportion to a high frequency band. This perturbation is applied to the amplitude signals after transforming synthetic image to the frequency domain using FFT and retransformed after the perturbation. This method was developed based on the observation that the high-frequency signal variations in the synthesized image are relatively smaller than in the real image. Using these naive augmentation methods has been effective in significantly improving accuracy in various tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and object recognition.",

The proposed method first derives power and phase components from a given source image and adds random jitters onto only power components for generating a pseudo-real image. A variance of random jitters increases as a spatial frequency increases, which indicates that high-frequency components are perturbed more than low-frequency components. Although the proposed method is simple, it outperforms baselines and several possible competitors in synthetic-to-real domain generalization.",

Technically solid methods for filling the gap between synthetic and real images will draw attention from a broad range of researchers and engineers.\n\nS2. The proposed method is simple but effective, which will be good news for practitioners interested in large-scale model training with a few training examples.
