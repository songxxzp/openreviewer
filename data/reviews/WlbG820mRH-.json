            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the formal output reachability verification of message passing neural networks (MPNN). The paper claims that the verification is impossible if for general graphs (unbounded size, nontrivial degree and node labels). But the verification is possible if there is a bound on the degree of the graph. \n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- This paper has theoretical results showing the impossibility of generally verifying MPNN, and a theoretical construction showing the possibility of verifying MPNN when the degree of the graph is bounded. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The problem considered in this paper has little importance and the results are not useful in practice. For verification in practice, we not only want decidability, but also computationally feasibility. NP-hardness of verifying NN is known. Therefore, considering the decidability of verification for graphs with unbounded size and degrees is not important, as computational complexity would play a more important role for larger graphs, which limits complete verification. Decidability is minor here, which is not the major factor hindering formal verification. \n- In practice, it is reasonable and acceptable for verification to only support specifications with some constraints, such as the size and degree of the graphs. While Theorem 1 says the impossibility of general verification, it would not fundamentally limit verification in practice. \n- The contribution of Theorem 2 is not significant. It only proves the possibility of verification when the degree is bounded, without proposing a computationally feasible algorithm (the construction seems to have an exponential complexity and thus it does not automatically imply a computationally feasible algorithm). On regular NNs, there already exist many concrete algorithms for formal verification. Then the contribution here is relatively insignificant. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The presentation is good and the work is original for the particular problem it is studying, to my best knowledge. But the problem seems to be minor and the conclusions are not practically useful for now. Reproducibility is not applicable for this purely theoretical paper.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This work has theoretical merits on showing the impossibility of general GNN verification. But the problem is minor. The \u201cfundamental limit\u201d is not a critical limit in practice and is not the critical factor hindering the development of formal verifiers, for two reasons: 1) computational complexity plays a more important role given the NP-hardness of NN verification; 2) constraints can be added on graphs in practice, which makes the verification possible. The second point corresponds to Theorem 2 in the paper, but the paper does not provide a concrete and computationally feasible algorithm while only proving the possibility of verification, and thus the contribution is not significant. \n\nUpdates: \n\nI am recommending a rejection because I think the contributions in this paper are insufficient, not because this is purely a theory paper. As I have said, NP-hardness in verification is known and is already fundamentally limiting the verification [1, 2]. Especially on verification for graphs with unbounded degree/size, NP-hardness is a stronger limit that can hinder exact verification in practice for unbounded cases. That\u2019s also partly why I said verification for the unbounded case is not important as we have already known NP-hardness on verification so I would not pursue generalizing verification to the unbounded case in practice. Therefore, for now, the limit revealed by Theorem 1 (decidability) is not an important limit compared to NP-hardness done by previous works and the contribution is minor. However, it could potentially become more significant if the paper can prove that the verification is not NP-hard in the special case for MPNN considered in this paper, to eliminate the limit revealed in previous works so that decidability could really be interesting and important. Theorem 2 only showing the possibility without a computationally feasible method is not making a sufficient contribution either.\n\nActually the failure to support that decidability is \"worse than NP-hard\" ([unconvincingly claimed by the authors](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WlbG820mRH-&noteId=LXeVO_iFIJ)) poses a significant weakness of this paper. This paper provides no evidence to support such a claim. Without it, given the existing works on NP-hardness [1 2], showing the undecidability is insufficient to support the significance of this work. See [my previous thread](https://openreview.net/forum?id=WlbG820mRH-&noteId=u3TrgCTLzp) on why I disagree decidability is worse than NP-hard.\n\nThe authors refuse to compare with existing works on regular NN, by saying this paper works on GNN but not regular NN. GNN is an extension of regular NN. There are works about NP-hardness of verification on regular NN and this paper needs to show that why their results don't apply to this paper in a formal way, e.g., by proving that the verification in their case is not NP-hard, which is missing in this paper and I am not sure if it is actually possible to prove that. The authors are responsible for ensuring their claims are sufficiently supported. \n\nOverall, there is a significant lack of evidence supporting the significance of the work.

The proof rely on the fact that due to the way MPNN work (each node can only process information that is most $\\texttt{GNN depth}$ nodes away, then if a graph satisfy a feasibility problem, there must a tree that satisfy it as well. Due to the assumption of bounded degrees, only a finite amount of those trees can exist, so it's possible to enumerate them, and to perform verification independently on each tree using traditional verification technique.",
