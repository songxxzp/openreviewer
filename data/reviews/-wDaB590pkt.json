The definition of domains is not clear. Why does biomedical KG not contain oncological information? Is the oncological domain defined by the 12 selected journal? How are these journals selected?\n2. The related work section lacks descriptions of methods that tackle the same task (learning a finer-grained KG from an existing coarse KG);\n3. The method section is lengthy (pages 3-7) and a little bit hard to follow. The authors should consider simplifying the notations or descriptions;\n4. Most importantly, the evaluation is not valid: (1) the main comparison should be made with other work that tackles similar tasks, not just variants of different biomedical PLMs; (2) the manual evaluation consists of only 50 samples and 1 physician. This is far from enough; (3) the authors should prove and show that the proposed model can discover new knowledge in oncology. Specific case studies must be provided.",

The authors leverage distant supervision to automatically label entities and triples from a find-grained domain based on a coarse domain. In specific, they first use distant supervision to annotate part of training corpus and train the NER and RE models. Then, the well-trained model will be applied on the left corpus to discover new entities and relations, where the high-confident ones will be used for further automate annotation. The experiments show improvements on the constructed test set. The presentation is mostly clear and easy to follow. However, there are several major issues that weaken the novelty.",

The novelty of the paper is limited, leaving the key challenges unsolved. For example, 1) how to ensure the newly discovered entities and relations are fine-grained, out of the given corse domain does not mean fine-grained. 2) How to avoid the error propagation during iterative training? 3) How to label the fine-grained types for newly discovered entities and relations?\n\n2. The evaluation is not convincing. First, it lacks strong baseline. What if using distant supervision to annotate all corpus and applying the trained model on test set directly? Second, the improvements are marginal. Especially, in ablation study, the improvements from each component are very limited, what is the significance test results? ",
