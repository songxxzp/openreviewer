            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a method for learning human locomotion policies from human motion data using an off-the-shelf differentiable physics simulator (DPS). Specifically, the method uses the Brax simulator (Freeman et al., 2021) to enable gradient computation of the forward dynamics. A simple joint and angle-based motion matching loss is used to supervise the training. To further improve the stability of training, the paper proposes a technique called demonstration replay, which resets the rollout state to the reference state when it deviates too much. Experiments on human locomotions and acrobatics show the method converges faster than RL-based methods while achieving similar motion quality.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:**\n\n- The method achieves faster convergence by using a differentiable physics simulator compared to RL-based approaches.\n- The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow.\n\n**Weakness:**\n\n- The novelty of the paper is limited. The idea of using a differentiable physics simulator to model human motions has been explored in prior work [1, 2] and in more complex settings, human pose estimation, navigation, path following, etc. There is no new method proposed in this paper besides using a differentiable physics simulator. The demonstration replay seems like an incremental technical contribution, and its benefit is not very significant given the mean pose error stays the same thus traditional approaches perform similarly over the whole motion.\n- From Table 1, we can see that DeepMimic actually outperforms the proposed method in at least 6 motions (Back-Flip, Dance, Run, etc.) where in some cases DeepMimic actually beats the method a lot (0.038 vs 0.070 for Dance), so this method overall has only slightly better performance than an RL-based approach like DeepMimic. Even though the proposed method learns faster due to the use of simulation, achieving better motion quality consistently in the end is more important for motion imitation.\n- From the visualization on the website, the \u201cjog\u201d motion produced by this method seems to be rather unnatural with the character limping, this does not happen for DeepMimic or AMP. There is also some foot sliding in the \u201croll\u201d motion. Are the artifacts caused by the use of a differentiable physics simulator, which might not enforce the contact constraints as well?\n\n[1] G\u00e4rtner, Erik, et al. \"Differentiable Dynamics for Articulated 3d Human Motion Reconstruction.\"\u00a0CVPR. 2022.\n\n[2] Won, Jungdam, Deepak Gopinath, and Jessica Hodgins. \"Physics-based character controllers using conditional VAEs.\"\u00a0SIGGRAPH 2022.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity & Quality: The paper is generally clear and easy to follow. The accompanying visualization through the interactive website is very helpful.\n- Novelty: As I said above, the paper lacks novelty since prior work [1, 2] has already explored applying a differentiable physics simulator to model human motions in much more complex settings. Technical innovation is also incremental.\n- Reproducibility: I believe the paper can be reproduced relatively easily for people familiar with motion and control.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper shows improved efficiency of motion imitation with a differentiable physics simulator. However, the motion quality improvement is not huge, and the paper didn\u2019t enable learning new motions that RL-based methods can\u2019t. A main concern is also the paper\u2019s lack of novelty. Therefore, I lean towards reject at this point.\n\n--- update ---\nAfter the rebuttal, I'm slightly more positive about this paper. I don't mind seeing the paper accepted. I still think the motion quality needs to be improved (e.g., obvious foot sliding). It is possible the lower quality is due to DPS's approximation of contact to enable differentiability, and it could be an inherent limitation of using DPS.",

With DPS and its gradients, the authors convert a policy learning problem to a much easier state matching problem. Instead of running an entire simulation during training, this paper proposes a Demonstration Replay mechanism to mitigate error accumulation. The Demonstration Replay replaces a simulation frame with the ground truth demonstration if its error is beyond a threshold. \n\nThe authors show that the proposed DiffMimic outperforms previous RL-based motion mimicking methods in terms of sample efficiency.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\nI think the biggest strength of this paper is that it presents a new direction toward motion mimicking problems. Compared to the previous reinforcement learning methods, the gradients from DPS can provide more information to the learning process and thus improve the sample efficiency. \n\nAnother strength is that the proposed approach can achieve reasonably good results (as shown in the supplementary video) for rather complex and dynamic motions. This method can also use constantly lower sampling numbers during the training than Deepmimic.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nOne of my concerns is the generalizability of this method. Since the dynamics and implementation details of the DPS might not be exactly the same as the original demonstration, it is not fully investigated how would the learned policy perform in the original simulation environment. \n\nMoreover, the authors mentioned relaxation in their DPS environment, \u201cThe joint limits of the character are relaxed to allow smoother gradient propagation.\u201d I wonder whether the measurement is performed in the same environment as the other comparison methods. How much difference this modification would bring to the learning task?\n",

For example, there is one missing citation in Section 2, paragraph 1, line 7. Moreover, curve plots (Figures 4 and 7) look kind of messy, and hard to distinguish the difference between methods. It might help if the authors could run multiple experiments with different random seeds to smooth the curve and draw the standard deviation with a shaded area.\n\nNovelty\n\nThe demonstration reply technique is simple but effective. Using DPS for motion mimicking is interesting. There is a concurrent work, ILD, as mentioned. It would be better, but probably not necessary since, to compare with it.\n\nReproducibility\n\nGiven that the authors promise to release the code and the method is not too complicated, I think the reproducibility should be fine.\n",
