            "strength_and_weaknesses": "*The paper visibly exceeds the allowed margins by a significant amount, so it is not clear whether it can proceed with the review process. Unfortunately, due to understandable fairness reasons, I believe there is a chance that the paper might need to be rejected; I will let the area chairs deliberate on that. In what follows, I will focus on the content of the paper under the assumption that the paper will be allowed, hoping that even if the paper is rejected the authors will still find the comments useful.*\n\n---\n\nOverall, I have a borderline opinion of the paper, more positive than negative. I didn't find any of the results especially surprising, but I find the paper well organized, and the bundling of topic well executed, with only a few reasons to be unhappy.\n\n1. What I find the most prominent weakness of the paper is the setting of strongly monotone games, which I find pretty restrictive, though of course I would be happy to be proven wrong by the authors. In particular, I'd be interested in knowing games of interest with more than two players that satisfy strong monotonicity. All the examples considered by the authors seem to have two players.\n\n2. (Adding more to point 1). I might be being silly, but the important conditions on $m$ in Theorem 1 and Theorem 4 require that the ratio $m/L$ be $m/L > O(1)\\sqrt{N-1}$. The reason why I find this a bit surprising is that $L$ is a Lipschitz constant on the gradients of the losses (fundamentally an **upper** bound on the variation), and $m$ is a strong convexity modulus for the gradients of the losses (fundamentally a **lower** bound on the variation). Hence, at least on some intuitive level one would imagine that usually $m/L < 1$, yet the conditions in the theorem require $m/L \\ge \\sqrt{N-1} \\ge 1$ for $N \\ge 2$. Maybe this is what the authors were trying to get at with Remark 1, but unless I'm missing something, this to me further reduces the applicability and appeal of the results in the paper in a way that Remark 1 was maybe too shy to clearly point out. Please let me know if I missed anything.\n\n3. Another area where the paper might have easily been improved was in giving high probability bounds rather than only in-expectation (I imagine that that would follow easily from concentration inequalities, but please let me know if I missed something).\n\n4. I found the description of the bandit setting, so focused on whether players are comfortable or willing to reveal actions, a bit unusual. I think perhaps the motivation for the bandit setting would have been better found in whether or not the players know their payoff matrix, or whether instead they need to learn that as well.\n\nOverall, my biggest reservations lie around my points 1 and 2 above; if those were resolved, my score for the paper would easily increase.\n\nNits / Typos:\n- At the end of page 3, there is a double comma \",,\"",

It is interesting to identify classes of games for which algorithms of a certain type will always converge to a Nash equilibrium. However, the m-strongly monotone games are a special type of convex game, in which all loss functions for each agent are convex. This seems to be a strong assumption on the game: for these games, only one Nash equilibrium exists. \n- The experimental analysis of the convergence of various algorithms on specific examples of Cournot games and retail pricing games is nice to see. The authors show that when their assumptions are not satisfied, some of the algorithms may cycle and never converge.\n\n# Weaknesses\n- Strong assumptions needed on the loss functions. In addition to m-strongly monotone, convex loss functions, Assumption 1 & 2 on Lipschitz continuity are needed. However, the authors identify specific applications in which these assumptions do hold, including Cournot games and retail pricing games.\n- Theorem 1 appears to be the main result of the paper. However, there is very little discussion of the Theorem or its proof in the main text. Much space is devoted to the gradient descent algorithms.\n- It would be nice if the authors identified specific algorithms, already extant in the literature, that fall into their framework but were not known to converge to Nash equilbrium. However, I did not see any discussion of this kind of result. Such algorithms would show the utility of the analysis.",

Additionally, the case of Gradient Ascent in Strongly-monotone games seems in my humble opinion, trivial generalization of convergence rate of GD in strongly convex minimization. Similarly, best response dynamics are trivially-expectedly well fitted in the convergence rate, since ExtraGradient and Optimistic methods aim exactly to approximate the implicit best-response problem. Therefore, the main contribution, besides the connection of no-regret and convergence, only zero-order should be mentioned as a novel part.\n\nAdditionally, after some investigation in the recent literature, I noticed the existence of a hardness result \n(The Computational Complexity of Multi-player Concave Games and Kakutani Fixed Points\nAuthors: Christos H. Papadimitriou, Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis, Manolis Zampetakis) which provides a PPAD-ness completeness for a specific class of strongly concave games with 2 players. It would be interesting the authors to include a short paragraph to explain why their algorithm can not resolve in polynomial case the underlying hard case. \n\n\nFinally, an extra comment, which should be better adjusted as a term, is the usage of the word (online class of games). In the analysis, the players learn about the game via their oracles access in an online way. However, the underlying game remains the same as the time-steps are going forward, Therefore, the characterization ''online'' belongs to the dynamics with which the single game is endowed rather than the underlying game.",
