            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies learning with graphs under the covariate shift assumption. The predictor is decomposed into two functions; one is the feature extractor of the graph, f, and the other is the discriminator, g. The generalization performance of the predictor h(G)=g(f(G)) for a graph G is governed by the Lipschitz constant of f and g. Through analysis of the theoretical properties of the feature extractor defined on the set of graphs, the authors proposed two regularization methods; spectral smoothness(SS) for the node transfer and maximum frequency response(MFR) for the link transfer. The theoretical findings well explain numerical results for link prediction and node classification. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n- In the paper, the transfer learning on the graph is roughly categorized into node transfer and link transfer. For each setting of the transfer learning, an appropriate regularization for the feature extractor is presented. An important insight provided by this paper is to recognize two types of information transformations on the graph. For each type, a reasonable regularization is proposed. \n\nWeaknesses\n- Only a single-layer architecture is used as the feature extractor f(G). Extension to multi-layer networks may be rather straightforward, though computational cost becomes high. A brief comment on such an extension can be beneficial for readers.\n- The categorization of node transfer and link transfer is interesting and important. Usually, we may not have sufficient prior knowledge of the scenario. Is it possible to determine which scenario occurs in practice? Which kind of information is beneficial to identify which scenario occurs?\n",

After a theoretical analysis, very close to the existing results in non-graph settings, the authors focus only on one term which drives the Lipschitz property of GNN (acting as a feature extractor) on graphs. Their methodological work then amounts to add a regularization over the graph spectrum based on spectral smoothness and/or maximum frequency response of the graph filter inside the GNN. Some numerical experiments on two types of datasets (Protein-Protein Interactions and Topic classification of articles) to study the possible performance of the method.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1- the idea of adapting  [Redko et al., 2017]  to graphs is relevant ;\n\n2- the obtained theoretical result (Corollary 1 and the two Lemmas of 4.1) appear to be sound.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1- the theoretical  results are obtained in a straightfoward re-purposing of the aforementioned works ; they don't look wrong, but not that original in lights of existing works.\n\n2- the reach of this results is limited because, as soon as it is obtained, the authors limit themselves to the $C_f$ Lipschitz constant and the proposed method appear then to be only a slight improvement on existing architectures ;\n\n3- the proposed regularizations, SSReg or MFRReg have an impact which is almost minor in Tables 1 and 2 ; and again in Tables 3 and 4 when comparing to GNN with DA-W ;\n\n4- most of the really novel content is of experimental nature (in Section 5) and the observations reported in 5.1 and 5.2 appear to be quite fragile: i) I am not convinced by the paragraph \"Hypotheses\" in 5.1 on the two tasks on PPI and I think that more experimental validations should be sought for before concluding that ; and ii) the discussion under \"Results\" in 5.1 is not fully convincing about the impact of DA. Ifw we follow the metrics in term of ranks proposed by the authors, methods with DA-W appear to perform better in Tables 1 and 2 than without. Looking at specific instances is toio much cherry-picking of results that seem to saturate (the improvement by the proposed method is often on the third digit in percentage)\n\n5- the article leverages many \"big\" models (Transformes, GNN with many layers) yet there is no major study about the computation power / time / expense incurred when doing this study (the only reported times are in Tables 13 and 14 in SI); The obtained marginal improvements should be discussed and put in balance with the increased computational costs. For instance, is the less than 5% increase in performance w.r.t. GraphCL  useful ?
