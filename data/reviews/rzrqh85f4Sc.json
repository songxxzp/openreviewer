            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel approach named FedOV which generates diverse outliers and introduces them as an additional unknown class in local training to address the label skew issue in one-shot Federated Learning (FL). Concretely, it proposes novel outlier generation approaches by corrupting the original features and further develops adversarial learning to enhance the outliers based on open-set recognition.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n\n- This paper points out that the voting-based FL approaches are either directly used as a final model for predictions or distilled as a single model, thus failing to produce high-quality federated learning models.\n\n- This paper may be the first time to propose open-set voting in FL by introducing the \u201cunknown\u201d class, which significantly improves the accuracy compared to traditional close-set voting in FL.\n- This paper proposes two techniques (i.e., data destruction and adversarial outlier enhancement) for generating diverse \u201cunknown\u201d outliers without requirement on the number of classes of the training data.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strength\n\n- The problem studied in this paper is interesting and valuable. Specifically, label skews is an essential issue that exists in one-shot federated learning and is urgent to be solved.\n- This paper provides some novel perspectives. Applying Open-Set Recognition (OSR) into FL to introduce an unknown class to improve the voting is a novel view for overcoming label skews in one-shot FL.\n- This paper conducts extensive experiments and demonstrates the advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art LDL methods, which can effectively reflect the performance of the algorithm.\n- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, which is easy to follow.\n- The code is provided in the attachment for reproduction.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- In section 1, the author mentioned, \"For example, in an extreme case where each client only has one label (e.g., face recognition), all clients predict the input as its own label and the voting result is meaningless\". This case is a typical situation studied in this paper. However, there exist some works handling this case that are not mentioned in this paper, such as [1]. I think it is necessary to discuss and compare the proposed algorithm with these methods.\n\n- In Table 3, one can notice that the performance of Distilled FedOV is worse than FedDF. The authors should analyze the reason for this phenomenon.\n\n[1] Yu, Felix, et al. \"Federated learning with only positive labels.\" *International Conference on Machine Learning*. 2020.",
