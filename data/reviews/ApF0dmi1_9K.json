The key idea is to use an eikonal equation for modeling a wave propgation of arrival time, which probably corresponds to the shortest path from the origin (and the target) to each arbitrary continuous points using a wave propgation. The model is composed of three subnetworks: (1) C-space encoder, (2) workspace encoder, and (2) time field generator. The C-space and workspace encoders encode the general goal configuration and robot configuration. Using these representations, the time field generator conducts biddirectional (both direction from the start and the target) motion planning and updates the configurations via propagation of each step, without expert data.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strengths\n\n- As far as I understand, the latent embedding of the configuration-space, that is processed with a nerual network, is novel. I believe this work contibutes to general stuides of motion planning and representation learning.\n- The overall methodology is sound, and there are some experiments that support the authors\u2019 claim.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n- Even though I think using a physics-insipred differential equation in a model is a good idea, but I think current version of manuscript the paper does not fully cover the reasoning behind introducing an eikonal equation in the motion planing domain. The authors are encouage to elaborate on the motivation of the equation for solving the navigation problem and fundamental benefits of using them over other planning methods for continous spaces.\n- In the article, it is not clear whether introducing a space encoder f(q) enables a finer planning results theoretically; likewise, I have an impression that the encoding method for the C-space seems to be not carefully designed to solve this specific problem.\n- In experiments, the performance of NTFileds (Figs. 4 & 6)  is not stellar. The authors are encouraged to put effort on validating their methodology qualitatively in a real-world problem.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "### Clarity & Reproducibility\n\n- This paper is well written, and it is possible to reproduce this work using the detailed description.\n\n### Quality\n\n- The paper included plenty of information on a physics-informed neural motion planner. The equations and materials are appropriately placed and easy to follow. Solving the problems of robot motion planning can be a good contribution for ICLR.\n\n### Novelty\n\n- Currently, I am not completely certain about the novelty of this work since there might be other continous time motion planning models.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Strengths:\n- A novel technical approach formulation based on physics-informed learning for motion planning. This perspective is interesting.\n- Empirically better field generation quality and faster planning time in execution given random start and goal configurations.\n\n### Weaknesses:\n- Experimental comparisons are weak. In my opinion, it can be much improved in several ways. See more details below. \n- Expensive training time as shown in Table 3 of the Appendix. Though the data generation is fast, training takes on the magnitude of hours. In this case, given the budget of hours, FMM or IEF3D might not be computationally intractable, so more comparisons are needed.\n- Not clear if the learned time field can generalize to different scenes (as IEF does). Do we need to retrain from scratch (for hours) when the underlying scene/layout changes?\n- No explicit discussions on limitations and failure cases - this is very important for a fair understanding of the paper.\n\n### Experimental comparison issues:\n- It would be better to show qualitative comparisons on field generation on more examples (only 2 currently) or present quantitative metrics to support the claim that NTFields generate correct time fields.\n- Lack of environment variations in the cluttered 3D environments - what would happen for different layouts? Also, the performance metrics \u201clength\u201d and \u201csafe margin\u201d seem somewhat contradicting to me, so not sure what the preference is here and if the proposed approach can control the trade-off.\n- As mentioned above, FMM and IEF3D should be included in the comparison on the 4-DOF and 6-DOF manipulation examples, as the training time for NTFields takes 15+ hours. It\u2019s necessary to see under the same generation+training time budget, how good FMM and IEF3D can achieve (the grid resolution does not need to be very high if they are indeed intractable, say it takes hundreds or more hours to generate the data).\n\n### Questions:\n- Does the bi-directional gradient-following approach always converge to a single path? Have you seen any cases where following the gradient will get stuck in a local plateau?\n- Regarding the training details in Appendix D, how are the hyper-parameters of l_0 and l_1 chosen for different examples, or how to adjust them in a generalizable way?\n- The nonlinear symmetric operator seems to help a little when looking at Figure 3. However, it is not clear how necessary it is for more examples and if it introduces extra training overheads.\n\n--------------------------------------\n### Post-rebuttal update:\nThe authors addressed most of my concerns described above, except for some major limitations of the method.",
