            "summary_of_the_paper": "To tackle long-horizon tasks such as rearrangement, a practical solution is to decompose it into subtasks and complete them sequentially. Each subtask can be solved by designing or learning a skill. However, there exist compounding errors in skill chaining. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes manipulation skills with mobility, which allow the base to move when the manipulation is undertaken, and devise a region-goal navigation reward for mobile manipulation as navigation is the transition between two manipulations. To evaluate the proposed method, this paper conducts experiments on 3 long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in the Home Assistant Benchmark, showing superior performance compared to the baselines.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The paper is logically clear in describing the method and experiment. The figures and video are vivid to show the key ideas.\n2. The motivation and idea (try to allow the base to move when the manipulation is undertaken) are flexible and interesting. Three principles to formulate subtasks (achievability, composability, reusability) are reasonable.\n3. The experiment results show that the proposed 3M model has improved performance in terms of long-horizon tasks.\n\nWeakness:\n1. The experiment settings could be explained in more details, such as cross-configuration and cross-layout in Figure 3, 5 and 7. The current version only simply introduces these concepts in Sec 5.1. It would be more clear if the authors could provide more detailed introduction.\n2. The experiment metric is only limited to the success rate. Is it possible to evaluate with more metrics like [1]?\n3. The paper simply removes the angular term in navigation reward without illustration or experimental evidence.\n[1]\tWeihs, Luca, Matt Deitke, Aniruddha Kembhavi and Roozbeh Mottaghi. \u201cVisual Room Rearrangement.\u201d 2021 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) (2021): 5918-5927.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper is working on object rearrangement. Comparing to prior work, the proposed method replaces the static manipulation skill with a mobile manipulation skill, which remedies the situation where the navigation target position makes manipulation infeasible due to physical constraints. A region-goal navigation reward is modified based on point-goal navigation reward to train the navigation skill. Experiments on 3 mobile manipulation tasks in HAB show that the proposed modifications can lead to a higher success rate than baselines in most testing settings.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Rearrangement can be hard when considering partial observability and various physical constraints. The modular approach makes solving each sub-task easier, while posing challenges to the overall feasibility. The proposed changes in this paper are intuitive and are trying to address such challenges. The reward is carefully designed. The ablations in the experiments are helpful and show clear comparison for each change made. \n\nQuestions / Weakness\n- There are many hard-coded biases injected. For example, the radius selected around the target position for mobile manipulation. How sensitive is the policy to the selection of these values? From the appendix it seems the radius affects the performance a lot. \n- 4.1: \u2018Finally, a feasible position is sampled from the candidates with rejection and noise.\u2019 What is the rejection based on?\n- \u2018In the S(L)+P experiment, we simply replace the initial states of stationary manipulation skills with those of mobile ones. \u2018 What percentage of initial states are not within the reachable workspace of the robot arm? If doing a simple check that uses IK to determine whether it\u2019s reachable by the robot, would there still be a large performance drop?\n- In Fig. 3, M+P is performing much worse than M3. What is the reason for that? As the mobile manipulation should be able to resolve the infeasibility caused by point-goal navigation. Is it more difficult for the mobile manipulation policy to work on a different layout?\n- Committing to a specific task plan without checking the intermediate physical constraints is the reason why static manipulation is failing. The current assumption is that the downstream subtask is always feasible and the subgoal is always achievable. If there are some other constraints, for example, if a re-grasp is needed (i.e. pick-place is not feasible but needs pick-place-pick-place), the subtask will still fail, which has the same underlying problem as static manipulation not able to solve the task because of collision or kinematic constraint. The proposed changes can improve the one on reachability. How would the current framework solve this type of problem in general?\n",

The point that the navigation map is not given and it's heavily partially observable, was not clear until I get to Section 5.1\nThe evaluation is clear and the ablations are helpful for understanding the source of performance gain.\nComparing to previous work on this problem, the changes are a bit limited, where the overall framework is the same, but with an update in skill definition.",

The addressed topic is an emerging one in the domain of embodied AI. The work mainly aims to tackle the issue of inaccurate terminal positions of the navigation skill. To mitigate the errors of positions (e.g., not satisfying some kinematic constraints), the new solution adopt a region-goal navigation reward, instead of point-goal reward in existing methods. The idea has been validated on ReplicaCAS and Habitat simulator. The experimental results are positive. ",

By using region-goal navigation award, the model has higher tolerance for the errors caused in the stage of navigation. \n- The writing is good. I have no complaints about the writing.\n\nWeakness:\n- The experiments are superficially treated. It is crucial for the readers to understand which key designs brought the performance elevation. Although two ablation studies (w.r.t. initial states or collision penalty) are provided, the proof is mainly based on comparing the success rates of different settings or methods. No further in-depth analysis is given.\n- The technical contribution is quite limited. The modification to conventional pipelines is the inclusion of region-goal (rather than point-goal) reward. Though it is proved to be effectiveness by various experiments, one can hardly claim this represents some significant contribution. ",

Normally one can re-implement the base code and achieve roughly some performance of the same level as reported in the paper. There seem no hidden trick in the model. Overall I would regard the re-implementation is non-trivial but achievable. ",

I have several concerns regarding the current version that makes me hesitate to recommend acceptance.\n\nThe technical significance of the proposed method should be clarified. For example, Section 4.2 only briefly describe the proposed region-goal navigation reward, without much convincing explanation of the key choices (such as \"remove the angular term\" since \"find that the success reward is sufficient to encourage correct orientation\"). This makes the draft somewhat more like a technical report. The corresponding experiments faithful report the success rates, from which the main claims are drawn. A few qualitative examples (e.g., Figure 4) are provided for better illustration. However, in-depth analysis is still missing. I would strongly suggest to make the sections of introduce, related work and preliminary knowledge more concise, leaving more space for more quantitative studies and ablation studies.",
