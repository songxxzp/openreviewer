However, this work can be further improved in the following aspects:\n\n- Fig. 1 is supposed to be a vector graph.\n- I have concerns about the impact of this paper. This work studies the method to track and control COVID, which does not use any ML or DL methods. Therefore, it may only bring limited insight or impact to the ML community. On the other hand, though a new compartmental model has been proposed, similar epidemic models have also been developed in recent studies. Meanwhile, this work does not provide any observations or suggestions which are not obvious or counterintuitive, which may also bring limited insights to the policymakers.\n- The form of Table 1 should be revised to meet the requirement of the conference.\n- It would be better to have some discussions after each theorem.\n- In equation 3, commas are missing in the first two equations.\n",

Finally, a limited set of experiments suggests the model can model some of the dynamics involved in one small dataset.",

The technical quality would be significantly improved by demonstrating the generalizability of  the model using a data-driven approach. Such an evaluation may also help improve the novelty, in the sense that it could help show the benefit of the stochasticity.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Novelty\n\nThe novelty of the proposed approach seems rather limited. In particular, while previous approaches had not considered stochasticity in modeling transitions, the population partitions were already characterized. Further, standard techniques are used to derive the update equations and prove the desirable qualities of the model. While the derivations appear quite technical to a non-expert such as myself, they appear to largely be based on standard methods.\n\nQuality\n\nIn terms of technical quality, I did not verify the derivations in detail, but they appear correct. \n\nI did not find the experimental results to be convincing. As mentioned above, they do not make clear to what extent the method and results generalize. First, the evaluation is limited to a relatively short period of time at a single location. Thus, it is not clear if the model would generalize to other locations which may have, for example, different immigration patterns or different masking policies.\n\nSecond, the predictive ability of the model is not assessed. So we do not know to what extent the model would work within the same location at different points in time, such as in winter, when the behavior patterns of individuals may change.\n\nThird, the proposed approach misses the beginning of the spike in the time and location on which it was tested. Presumably, this would be the most important trend to pick up since it would suggest some change in policy would be needed.\n\nClarity\n\nThe writing has a number of small typos. While I do not believe they affect understanding of the paper, they do become distracting. The paper would benefit from another round of editing.\n\nThe references are not consistently formatted.\n\nAs a small clarification for the beginning, MERS is the result of a merbecovirus, not a sarbecovirus; they are all betacoronaviruses, though.\n\nThe notation in the paper is quite heavy, but the authors do a reasonable job of explaining the intuition behind the parapers. I also appreciate that they found space for a notation table.\n\nReproducibility\n\nAs far as I could tell, no code or synthetic datasets were provided. Nevertheless, I believe similar results could be obtained based on the equations given in the paper.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I believe the limited methodological contributions and lack of experimental evidence of generalizability will limit the impact of this work.
