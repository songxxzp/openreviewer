On three commonly used datasets and a soon-to-be open-sourced dataset, the proposed model demonstrated clear improvement compared to several baselines. ",

To validate the proposed GraphVCI method, the authors run experiments on several publicly available datasets, which I consider the main experiments are thorough. Besides, the codes are supplemented in the submission, this can help or guide interested readers to reproduce the results. \n\nWeakness: I think the ablation studies such as excluding the counterfactual-related losses and features should be performed in the paper,\nthis can disentangle the contributions that come from different network components. Second, I don't know why the predicted distributional shift presented in Figure 5 matches the true shift, and I feel that they look quite different from each other. Could the authors explain this to me? In the end, the authors introduced 'the causal relation diagram' in Figure 1. I think it would be important to compare it with the standard causal graph definition such as the structural causal model (SCM). ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors aim to tackle the problem of predicting the effect on gene expression of cellular perturbations such as gene knock-out. The authors build upon Variational Causal Inference (Wu et al 2022b). VCI takes as input a set of features X, given treatment T (e,g, drug treatment or knockout of a particular gene) and outcome Y (RNA-seq following treatment). It aims to predict, for some alternative treatment T', the corresponding outcome Y'. The authors extend VCI by additionally taking as input a gene regulatory network (GCN). The authors evaluate the method by holding out several perturbations for a particular cell type and using their method to predict the held-out values. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Overall, the paper is strong. The text and figures are understandable. The results have significance both in terms of methodology and application. The experimental results are good.\n\nNovelty is moderate because most of the paper is an extension of (Wu et al 2022b). However, the addition of the GCN to VCI is novel.\n\nThere is no description of how the authors go from experimental RNA-seq data to values of X and Y, including in Appendix C, which explains some other parts of the experiments. In particular, I couldn't figure out what X is for their experiments. I think they followed (Lotfollahi et al 2021a) in this, but it was hard to figure out what the authors of this paper did even when examining Lotfollahi et al 2021a. My best guess is that X is a discrete indicator of cell type.\n\nThe setup is rather specific to the application to RNA-seq because it requires that each individual has an information-rich outcome. It doesn't seem obvious that the same setup would work in a setting such as clinical drug response, where each individual has information-rich features but simple outcomes (e.g. symptoms resolved or not resolved). \n\nIt is unclear whether the revised GCN produced by the method of Sec 2.3 is improved according to the desirable criteria for GCNs. There are many existing methods for producing GCNs, so it would be helpful to argue if this improvement method is a better approach for producing a GCN in general, or if it is a preprocessing step useful only for input to a NN method like this.

The method is aided by an additional method for updating the connections of the GRN prior to model training.

While some of the results show clear superiority over existing methods, there are overlapping error bars in Table 1, and Figure 5 seems not to show what is claimed.
