Inputs are encoded into temporal sequences of exponentially-decaying spikes that then determine the temporal evolution of weight variables associated with the inputs. Clustering is then performed to determine the hierarchical structure encoded in the weights.  The authors show that their method outperforms other hierarchical methods when used on imbalanced or dynamically changing hierarchies.  To the reviewer's knowledge, this work represents a novel method of dynamically learning and inferring hierarchical structure in a bottom-up manner from sequential data.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\nThe authors provide a novel, yet simple dynamical method that infers the hierarchical structure of dynamical inputs well. The results appear to improve upon current methods and may provide insight into how biological neural networks perform similar analyses on incoming data streams.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe manuscript would benefit from a clearer explanation of the method and from the example inputs that were used being made explicit (please see below for more details).",

I found the input encoding difficult to parse.  This could be improved with a clearer explanation and by using Figure 2a to clarify the relevant variables ($x_i, S_t, s_{i,t}, n, k ,\\tau, ...$)\n\n2.  The authors refer to the $\\sigma$ space of their method (e.g., Fig 2c), but I was unable to find this defined anywhere in the manuscript. What is it, and what determines its dimensionality?\n\n3. $k$ is given as a hyperparameter and set to 5 for most of the analyses, but it is unclear why this value is used.  What happens if different values of $k$ are used? Is there a way to infer what the value of $k$ should be?\n\n4. The 2nd term of the inactive portion of Eq. 3 has a divisor of $d^2$ rather than $d$ like the other terms have.  Is there a reason for this asymmetry to be introduced?  What happens if $|d|$ is used instead, e.g.?\n\n5. What are the input sequences used for the results shown in Figs 4-7?  While having this provided in code will be useful, the manuscript's readability would be enhanced by including this information.\n\n6.

A related dynamical equation has also been studied in the design of gene circuits [Ref 1].\n\n- Baseline\n\nThe authors only use word2vec (2013) to serve as one representation of learning, when several methods, such as GloVe, FastText, BERT, are actually much more widely adapted baselines in the representation learning community. \n\nThe authors studied simulated data, karate club network, and bottlenose dolphin social network data in the real-world and evaluated its mutual information scores. \n\n**References**\n\n1.

In fact, it sets up a foundation for a new paradigm in machine learning solely based on self-organization from dynamical equations, namely Self-Organizing Dynamical Equations, which are inherently accurate and adaptive.\").
