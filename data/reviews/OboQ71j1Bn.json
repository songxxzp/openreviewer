            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to compose energy-based diffusion models for compositional generation. The authors first point out the deviation between sampling from the composed score function and sampling from the composed diffusion model. To this end, MCMC samplers are adopted in the sampling procedure to improve the composition generation of diffusion models, and with proper energy-based parameterizations, Metropolis corrections may be incorporated into the sampling process. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes the composition of diffusion models in different ways and on different data.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. This paper has a good motivation. For diffusion models, compositionality can be an important property for many applications. For example, in the experimental results, the proposed method has shown good performance in the compositional scene generation and text-to-image generation.\n2. This paper clearly explains the problems of diffusion models in compositional generation, and uses MCMC samplers which may incorporate Metropolis corrections by energy-based parameterized diffusion models. The effectiveness of the sampling procedure is validated in the experiments.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The novelty of the paper seems limited. All the building blocks of the proposed method are referred to existing works, including the composition operations in Section 3, MCMC samplers in Section 4.1 and energy-based parameterization in 4.2. \n2. The organization of the paper can be improved. Preliminary knowledge (including introduction to diffusion models in Section 2 and introduction to composition operations in Section 3) span more than three pages. In contrast, the main technical part is too short to elaborate the method.   \n3. Although the paper points out the deviation between sampling from the composed score function and sampling from the composed diffusion model; however, this gap is not demonstrated on all tasks/datasets in the experiments.\n4. In the abstract, it says \u201cexplore alternative ways to condition, modify, and reuse diffusion models\u201d and \u201cwe investigate why certain types of composition fail using current techniques and present a number of solutions\u201d; however it seems that there are no corresponding content in the main body of the paper, do I miss something or is it overstated in the abstract?\n\nSome comments:\n- Figure 3 lacks some necessary explanations, for example, what do the boxes with different colors indicate? \n- In Table 2 and Table 3, are EBM and Energy the same model?\n- Some good experimental results of text-to-image are shown in Figure 5. Some failure cases of this task can also be shown and discussed.",

One of the fundamental limitations of the current text to image models is the inability to compose several relationships, hence this problem is an important one to address. The paper takes a principled approach for this problem by considering an energy minimization perspective. They come up with good sampling algorithms that seem to improve over baseline.\n\nWeakness:\nOne of the main weaknesses I see is the similarity between this paper and [1]. This paper addresses the exact same problem and they take an energy minimization perspective. This paper considers both product distributions and negations.  They use MCMC as well. The authors in this paper cite this work, but they don't mention the similarities and differences between this work. I find this very concerning. I think the difference lies in the samplers used. This paper uses HMC which [1] doesn't. But I'm still unable to assess how this is better than [1].\n\nWith respect to experimental validation, the authors show that using HMC improves over other baseline samplers. But, it would have been nice to include comparison with other papers like what [1] did. In fact, [1] had a table for CLEVR dataset. It would have been nice if the authors showed the comparison with that.\n\n[1] Liu et al., \"Compositional Visual Generation with Composable Diffusion Models\", ECCV 2022",
