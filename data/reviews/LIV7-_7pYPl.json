            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper explores the task of dexterous manipulation with human demonstrations. The paper introduces an interesting set of simulated benchmarking tasks, along with a baseline approach to solve these. The benchmark builds on prior work (Plasticinelab), using a simulated shadow robot hand. The proposed baseline relies on human demonstrations captured using a leap motion controller, and mapped to shadow hand using an ik solver. An implicit representation of the scene (observed in point cloud form) is learned using a point cloud encoder decoder model. this representation is then combined with actions, and a sequence of these mapped into another latent space, a dynamics model is learned using this representation, and used for goal-based planning.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\nThe proposed set of benchmarks is interesting, and the results appear to show that the proposed approach performs well at these.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe biggest concern I have here is that the description of the proposed approach is rather unclear, and I struggled to follow section 2.4. It is not at all clear to be how the different components in the model connect, and how the baseline approach is trained or used at run-time. It would be helpful to provide a figure illustrating this, and to standardise notation to align with Fig 2. Notation needs a lot of care, for example Locc is seemingly also referred to L(g,h) on page 4, and this makes it hard to keep up with and follow much of the method. I appreciate that some of this is in the appendix, but feel section 2.4 could do with a bit of a rewrite in service of the reader, as at present the complexity here limits reproducibility and does not do the method justice.\n\n\nMinor points:\n\nPar 2: \"...consider the problem of deformable object manipulation with the Shadow Dexterous hand.\" please rephrase to a *simulated* shadow dexterous hand.\n\nThe paper repeatedly claims to provide the first dexterous manipulation benchmark for deformable objects (to the best of the authors knowledge), but learning based approaches have been widely used in robotics literature, along with many deformable manipulation tasks (rope, cables, cloth folding). Plasticinelab, which this work builds on, requires the manipulation of deformable objects. Is the definition of dexterous manipulation used here specifically down to the use of a multi-fingered hand?\n\nCan you provide additional detail about the environments? Eg. actions (are these joint torques?) and point clouds (are these rendered with respect to the camera view point? do they factor in occlusions) etc.\n\nSection 2.3 \"Given a novel deformable shape, how do we solve it...\" Rephrase - I don't think you can solve a shape.\n\nSection 3.3: \"We illustrate that pure EMD might not be a good measure for soft bodies with large topological variations Feydy (2020)\" - I don't see an illustration of this. If EMD is not a good metric, shouldn't the benchmark report alternatives too?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper could do with some improvement of clarity, particularly around the method for this to be reproducible. I would recommend a bit of a rewrite for clarity, particularly focusing on notation, and explaining the method (perhaps rethinking what is in the appendix and what isn't). This also applies to the abstract, which doesn't really convey the approach very clearly.\n\nThe paper proposes an interesting set of deformable object manipulation tasks and a method of learning these, which could be useful for others to build on and test their algorithms. The method itself does not seem to be particularly novel.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper introduces an interesting benchmark for goal oriented dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, alongside a latent learning-based planning approach. The explanation of the latter needs to be improved.\n\n---- Post rebuttal updates ----\n\nI think the authors have added sufficient clarity and addressed most of my concerns, hence am raising my score.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper tackles the task of dexterous manipulation of deformable objects and introduces a pipeline involving gathering human demonstrations, learning representations for the scene and the demonstrations, and augmenting novel data samples via a differentiable simulator. The proposed pipeline, DexDeform, starts with a small set of demonstrations to learn scene representations and skill abstractions, a dynamics model, and an initial policy. It then iteratively runs training and exploration stages where a gradient-based trajectory optimization is applied via a differentiable simulator to augment available samples. The paper presents evaluations on a variety of tasks, including soft object folding, wrapping, and flipping with a single or dual Shadow hand. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1- The paper is well-motivated. The concerns raised at the beginning are later addressed.\u00a0\n\n2- The optimization objective in Eq. 1 leverages the implicit scene representation, nicely overcoming the challenges of modeling soft objects.\n\n3- Few demonstrations are enough to initialize the models, and it is straightforward to gather them by using the proposed teleoperation setup.\n\n---\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1- What is the design choice behind using a non-dynamic skill abstraction network? I think a temporal variant with a learnable prior would be more useful and allow for sampling of the next latent sample z. A sampled latent trajectory could be used in the exploration phase instead of augmenting the targets and running optimization in the observation space.\n\n2- It is not clear if the prior of the skill abstraction network is used. I assume the latent skill samples in Eq. 1 are randomly initialized from the standard Gaussian prior. Could the authors clarify this?\n\n3- I think the evaluations could be fairer. The baseline models take the input from the scene in point cloud representation. The implicit scene representation learned by the ConvONet and the scene embeddings learned by the VAE are trained in isolation by using standard training objectives. I believe the baseline models could use the same latent embeddings as the proposed method.\n\n4- This is in line with my previous comment. The baselines and how they are implemented seem rather straightforward. A goal-conditioned policy (see [1*] for grasping rigid objects as an example) could be well suited for the tasks introduced in this paper. The goals could be represented by latent scene embeddings. This is not a weakness per se, but a suggestion. I think stronger baselines would improve the quality of the submission.\n\n[1*] Christen, Sammy, et al. \"D-Grasp: Physically Plausible Dynamic Grasp Synthesis for Hand-Object Interactions.\"\u00a0Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.",

The skill abstraction is defined by a fixed temporal interval. Finally, the planned action sequence is refined by gradient descent since the simulator is differentiable.

It\u2019s easy to read and understand the main message of the paper. The figures are also nice and well-designed.\n\nWeakness:\n1) Since I consider this paper as an engineering effort to build a practical system, I\u2019m worried about if the results can be easily transferred to the real world. Specifically, this paper assumes perfect point clouds both for input and goals. However, it is unlikely to obtain perfect point cloud observations in the real world due to sensor noise. It is also hard for the user to specify point clouds as the end state.\n2) The authors does not promise code release.
