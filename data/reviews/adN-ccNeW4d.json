Overall, it is interesting but the explanation itself seems to be not based on the ground truth of neuroscience thus appears to be a bit post-hoc given the establishment of ADAM and RMSProp. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \nThe idea of explaining the gradient update from neuroscience view is interesting. \n\nWeakness:\n1. In terms of equation (6) and (7), it seems to be a very deliberate operation to split the concentration and gradient into both positive and negative parts here. What do you refer to by the $m^+$ and $m^-$ here? The high flux or low concentrations of $Ca^{2+}$? Why can you assume that it is depending on the \"gradient\" with a linear relation? For me, there lacks some evidence here to support the reasoning procedure beyond assumption. For example, ref [1] gives the dynamics equation for LTP/LTD. \n\n2. The model for RMSProp has the same issue as above. Rewrite the existing updating rule into a flow is not convincing as you can associate the parameter values with high arbitrariness. I expect that there should be some intermediate process that explains why it takes the specific parameters. \n\n\nRef:\n[1] https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.132651299",

This paper contributes to this field and provides a hypothesis for experimental neuroscience to explore. \n- Bio-adam is an interesting and novel algorithm. \n- The paper is well written and clear. \n\nWeaknesses\n- The main contribution of this work is to present a biologically motivated implementation of adam (there are no computational advantages proposed). However, in my view the biological connections are undeveloped, and only loosely motivated by neurobiology. As a result I find this work\u2019s contributions limited.   \n- I do not find gradient transport and the weight symmetry learning rule particularly biologically plausible, and as such do not find this aspect of the work that convincing. First, there is little to no evidence for 1 to 1 forward backward connections in the brain being a general principle. Second, backward synapses would need to be able to communicate signed errors, which they cannot, or alternatively there should be two sets of backward synapses for each sign. Third, in my understanding axonal signaling is not equipped to signal with the time resolution that would be required. \n- There is no advantage of bio-adam shown over a more simple update such as sgd+momentum, which would most likely be simpler for biological systems to approximate. \n",
