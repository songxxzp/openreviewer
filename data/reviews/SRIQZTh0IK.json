            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes Analogical Networks, a method for segmenting 3D parts of objects which excel in the few-shot setting. Specifically, the method retrieves examples from a memory bank closest to the query object, then assigns correspondences between parts of the query object and those of the examples. The approach outperforms existing 3D object segmentation and meta-learning methods for few-shot 3D part segmentation. Additionally, the paper shows that part correspondences for novel classes emerge from training without part specific labels.  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Overall the proposed approach is interesting and, to my knowledge, novel. The problem of few-shot segmentation is decently motivated given that dense annotations are time consuming to obtain at scale. \n\n2. The ablations are well thought out and provide interesting empirical insights such as how parametric methods compare to a memory-based approach for 3D object parsing. \n\n3. The within-instance pretraining using point cloud augmentation is a clever solution to the non-differentiable aspect of the retrieval mechanism. \n\n4. The method outperforms 3D-DETR and Prototypical Networks for 3D part segmentation. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The baselines compared against seem relatively weak. 3D-DETR is designed for detecting whole objects and Prototypical Networks are not designed for 3D object detection. It would be informative to compare against baselines meant for 3D part segmentation such as PartNet[1] and PriorNet[2] or explain why these methods are not suitable for comparison.\n\n2. Qualitative results are only shown for the base classes. Given that the goal is few-shot transfer, it would be better to see qualitative results for the few-shot classes (washer, fridge, bed, table). \n\n3. Discussion of 3D object detection in the related works would be helpful to situate the work in context. The paper states that works thus far have used separate networks to parse each semantic category, but does not explain or show experimental results to demonstrate why this approach is worse. \n\n4. The motivation for part segmentation given in the abstract is dubious. The paper states, \"Fine-grain visual parsing is necessary for ... action recognition\". However, most state-of-the-art action recognition methods work directly from pixels and do not parse objects into fine-grain parts. \n\n[1] Yu, Fenggen, et al. \"Partnet: A recursive part decomposition network for fine-grained and hierarchical shape segmentation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019.\n\n[2] Wang, Xiaogang, et al. \"Learning fine-grained segmentation of 3d shapes without part labels.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2021.\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity:\n1. For the emergent part-correspondences experiment it appears that 3D-DETR is comparable in performance to Analogical Networks at 1-shot and 5-shot, but significantly lower at many-shot. The trend is the opposite for the part segmentation experiment. I\u2019m wondering why this is the case, considering the claim that Analogical Networks are better in the few-shot data regime. \n\n2. It is unclear which experiments address which questions posed at the beginning of the experiments section. For example, the question \u201cHow much the performance of Analogical Networks varies with different retrieval mechanisms?\u201d is only answered by looking through the appendix. \n\n3. In the section for within-instance pretraining, how the encoder is trained is not well explained. The text states the encoder is pretrained using the within-instance correspondences, but figure 2 (which is meant to illustrate the pretraining) only shows the modulator. As I understand it, the encoder is not directly optimized for the retrieval objective, and gradients are propagated through the modulator to the encoder from the part correspondence objective. However, this is not clear from the figure or text. \n\nReproducibility:\nCode snippets are provided in the appendix.\n\nFor novelty see strengths and weaknesses.\n",

Overall casting the problem of parsing 3D objects as analogical correspondence is a novel and interesting idea. However, the paper does not compare with other 3D part segmentation methods or clearly place their approach in the context of part segmentation papers. Additionally, the insights in the experiments section are difficult to follow. The empirical questions posed at the beginning of the section are interesting, however it is not clear where each one is explicitly answered. With improved clarity in the experiments section and more complete comparison to existing work I would be happy to improve my score.",
