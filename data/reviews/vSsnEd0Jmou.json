            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an open-source framework to be used to allocate scarce resources to a pool of recipient.  The application example presented in the paper is allocation of organs to recipients, an application area where optimizing the allocation is extremely important.  The framework is meant to be used to explore dynamic policies for the allocation. The system used discrete time settings for the simulation, modeling arrival times for resources and for recipients and generating outcome predictions.  The framework, which learns from past data, is designed to be modular and customizable. An important aspect is the ability to do counterfactual reasoning and provide for each pair resource-recipient the potential outcome. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: the problem addressed is an important problem, not just for the application studies but for other potential areas of applications.  The framework proposed has multiple properties, like modularity and customizability. Modularity allows to connect it with external applications, custinmizability enables the users to decide what they need. Counterfactual inference is used to make predictions. The software is open source.\nWeaknesses: there is no indication that the proposed framework has been discussed with potential users, to guarantee it provides a valuable solution for the intended users. It is still up to the practioners to decide how to configure the system, what analysis to do, etc.  If the framework has to become usable by a variety of practioners, much more guidance would be needed for specific cases. This is not difficult and does not need to be done immediately.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposed a simulation environment for evaluating scarce resource (e.g., Kidney, Liver) allocation policy. The proposed allocation simulator (AllSim) is modular, learnable and customizable. The simulator provides functionality for generating resource and recipient distribution, allocating resources, and evaluating performance of the allocation. It allows practitioners to properly tune different knobs of the simulator to match their practical needs. The paper also demonstrates the performance of different components experimentally.  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Scarce resource allocation (e.g., Kidney/Liver matching) is an extremely important and challenging problem that requires online planning. While there has been significant effort in AI and OR communities to find optimal online matching of demand and supplies of these scarce resources, we absolutely need an accurate simulation environment for evaluation of different decisions. The proposed simulator can be used for counterfactual evaluation of policies learned by offline RL methods from a batch dataset. The simulator provides end-to-end functionalities from generating demand and supply of resources, allocating resources and evaluating a policy by supporting counterfactual inference. Having said that, I have some reservations regarding the technical novelties of the paper. There have been efforts for generating simulation environments for kidney or liver matching or transplantation (e.g., SimUNet: https://unos.org/solutions/simunet/). Does the simulator generalize to different settings of organ matching with simple tunable knobs? Moreover, tuning these knobs could be challenging for the practitioners as the outcome might depend on a variety of indicators for individual patients. I think it would be great if the authors can perform a human evaluation study and report statistics in terms of how much value the actual practitioners see in this simulator. If it does not pass the bar of practitioner\u2019s expectation, then the counterfactual evaluation in the simulator might not be of practical use. On the other hand, I was expecting some guidance on how to tune the knobs of the simulator, especially for accelerating research progress in this domain. ",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is generally written well and easy to follow. The motivations, key components of the simulator and their usage are explained clearly. The authors shared the source code of the simulator, so it can be easily reproduced. Related works are exhaustive and covered relevant papers in different settings. My only concern remains with the technical novelties and practical deployment of the simulator in the real-world as mentioned earlier. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper proposed a novel simulator with end-to-end functionalities for evaluating a scarce resource allocation policy, especially in medical domain setting. An accurate simulator would be hugely effective for research progress in the medical domain as well as offline RL space. I appreciate the specific functionalities of resource allocation and counterfactual inference, and their detailed explanation in experimental results. Moreover, the simulator could be easily reproduced as the source codes are shared. Having said that, I still have some reservations regarding the technical/methodological contributions, e.g., how well it generalizes to different organ settings and how much finetuning is required are not clear to me, and its practical adoption, e.g., I expected an human evaluation on how satisfied the practitioners are with the simulator, or how much effort the practitioners need to finetune all the knobs, or even if it is feasible to properly tune all the knobs to generate accurate behavior or outcomes of a patient health?
