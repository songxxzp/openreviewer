            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper concerns anomaly detection. In particular, it considers the fact that the definition of an \"anomaly\" depends on the use case. The goal is to flag \"real anomalies\" (unusual variation in features we care about) while ignoring \"pseudo-anomalies\" (unusual variation in nuisance features). Nuisance features are labeled in each image. The paper names this setting \"negative attribute guided anomaly detection\" (NAGAD). The paper benchmarks a four baseline methods on NAGAD (3 pre-existing datasets). They also provide their own method, inspired by the domain-supervised disentanglement literature. The new approach has a few components:\n* ImageNet-pretraining for the image encoder.\n* A SimCLR-style contrastive loss applied independently on each collection of images with the same value for the nuisance factor.  This is meant to eliminate information about nuisance factors.\n* A reconstruction loss applied to the output of an image generator. The generator takes as input (i) the representation and (ii) the value of the nuisance variable. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strengths\n* Anomaly detection is an interesting and important problem.\n* The paper is generally well-written.\n* The idea that it is more reasonable to specify nuisance factors a priori than it is to specify the features where you expect anomalies makes a lot of sense from a practical point of view, so the NAGAD problem setting seems well-motivated. The metrics used for benchmarking also seem sensible. \n* The experiments are reasonably thorough, with a good number of recent methods tested across several datasets. \n\n# Weaknesses\n* When we consider Table 7 alongside Table 2, it's not obvious that the proposed method is a significant improvement. The proposed method is within the margin of error of a competitor for AD-Score, worse than a competitor for PA-Score (this is true for 2/3 datasets), and better than the competitors for RA-Score. Note that we don't have error bars for other datasets, only for the How should we understand these results?  \n* There is no ablation study for the components of the proposed method. \n* These seem to be toy datasets. If NAGAD is meant to be a well-motivated practical problem, shouldn't there be more challenging real-world datasets where this problem shows up? Section 7 mentions this point, but dismisses it on the grounds that the current methods would not do well. Even if current methods wouldn't work great, it seems worthwhile to ground the study of NAGAD in realistic data. \nOn the topic of practicality, there are a few points relevant to real-world uses that are not addressed:\n* The paper asserts that the (more realistic) case of multiple attributes can be handled \"very naturally\" - I would like a more detailed explanation. \n* The paper assumes that nuisance factors are categorical. Is this a significant limitation or is there an easy way around it? \n* The paper assumes that nuisance factors are always identified correctly - what if the user is wrong about a feature being a nuisance factor? \n* If the user does not enumerate every possible nuisance factor, do they pay a price because the representation is forced to preserve everything else (including all unspecified nuisance factors)?\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "# Clarity & Quality\n* Some of the writing could be made clearer. For instance, I found the paragraph that begins \"This objective encourages the encoder to map...\" to be confusing due to the \"hand-wavey\" mathematical statements. I would either reference [Wang & Isola 2020] and leave the details to them, or be more precise about the statements and why they matter to the reader. Also, $F$ seems to never be used again. \n* I was surprised by how ineffective all methods seem to be at achieving invariance (Table 8). Particularly for Edges2Shoes! It doesn't really seem appropriate for any method here to claim to \"learn a representation that is invariant to nuisance factors\" if these are the empirical results. Am I reading this incorrectly? Please offer some insight. \n\n# Novelty\n* To the best of my knowledge the proposed approach and the NAGAD setting are both novel. \n\n# Reproducibility\n* Are baseline numbers copied and pasted or were they re-trained for the purposes of this paper? \n* Are all methods using the same backbone? \n* What was the protocol for hyperparameter tuning? Was it different for the proposed method and the baselines? ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall I like this paper and I enjoyed reading it, but I have some questions about the details that I would like to see addressed. There also seems to be a notable disconnect between the stated real-world motivation for the paper and the work in the paper (which is focused on a simplified case with toy problems). Regardless, I find the paper to be valuable and interesting and I would ultimately like to see it accepted if these issues can be resolved. ",

The proposed method focuses on a setting where the user can define one or more nuisance attributes such that the algorithm should ignore the impact of nuisance attributes when identifying anomalies. This is done by first learning a representation of the data that does not consider the nuisance attribute using a contrastive disentanglement algorithm. The second step is to find anomalies by using a nearest neighbor strategy on the representation data. Results are shown on benchmark data sets and the method is shown to outperform other strategies for detecting anomalies which do not consider the nuisance attribute.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n+ The paper formulates a novel anomaly detection problem which might have potential applications when dealing with visual data.\n+ The idea of using the knowledge of nuisance attributes and incorporating it in the representation phase is based on past idea, but using it for anomaly detection is novel.\n+ The experimental analysis is interesting.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The approach is meant for a particular type of data sets, for example, images, where the analysis is done on the observations (images) while the nuisance attributes are part of the environmental conditions in which the data was recorded. The nuisance attributes are not encoded in the data as independent features,  otherwise one could just remove them from the analysis. However, the title and abstract does not make that clear. I would request authors to clarify that. Or, if they believe that the method is applicable in other settings (straight tabular data), then they should include discussions about why this would be better than simply removing the attribute.\n\n- The authors distinguish their methods from past work as this - \"Our approach differs from previous approaches to this problem. Previous approaches require knowl- edge of an attribute that should be used to identify the anomalies. Out of distribution detection assumes that anomalies belong to a novel class, outside the fixed set of labelled classes. The weakly supervised setting assumes future anomalies will be similar to a few labelled anomalous samples available during training.\" There are no references here so it is hard to know which approaches are they referring to. Also, I do not think traditional anomaly detection methods require knowledge of attributes to identify anomalies. They possibly require normally labeled data (and maybe some labeled anomalies). Could the authors clarify on this?\n\n- The authors have not talked much about the real world scenarios where this problem formulation might be applicable.\n\n- The level of innovation in the method is limited, given that the method builds on past work on contrastive disentanglement. \n\nSome minor comments:\n- What is an operator? It was unclear in the abstract if the authors are referring to a human operator or a mathematical operator.\n- Is there a citation for this statement - \"A major source for such biases is the presence of additional, nuisance factors.\"?\n- I did not understand the example: \"For example, assume all buses in the training data were captured in a certain pose since they were driving in a bus lane. It is likely that a bus driving lawfully in a regular lane will be viewed from a different angle than the buses in the normal data. Thus, it will be regarded as an anomaly by current standards.\" Are you saying that it is possible that a bus driving lawfully in a regular lane might be viewed from a different angle? I am not well-versed with this domain (and I am guessing many readers won't be as well), so I would request the authors to clarify this.\n- I was confused by this example: \"For example, an encoder guided to be invariant to driving lane, would be trained to contrast images of females against other images of females, but not against images of males (and vice versa).\" Why are we suddenly talking about females and males in the driving context?",
