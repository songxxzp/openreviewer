To be specific, the author decomposes the receiver-to-receiver RIR prediction into two parts: inverse-RIR and forward RIR, which is a very interesting design.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The paper solves the RIR prediction in a novel view: modeling the sound field with some positions with acoustic information, which is somewhat a interpolation method. Receiver-to-receiver sound field modeling requires no knowledge about the source and can support more complex scene.\n2. The author decomposes the receiver-to-receiver RIR prediction into two parts: inverse-RIR and forward RIR, which is a very interesting design and has physical intuition.\n3. The experiments are convincing and adequate, consisting of several datasets with different source number. The ablation verifies the effectiveness of each proposed technique.\n\nWeakness:\n1. Since the impulse response is the response of an impulse, it is a time-delay function (i.e., the impulse response assumes the impulse is emitted at the time 0, and the receiver gets the signal at positive (delay) timestamp). When we predict the waveform for a new position p_new, we convolve the waveform of a known position p_known with two IRs (inverse-RIR and forward RIR). In this case, the waveform will be further delayed, which means the method cannot handle the case that p_new is closer to the source than p_known. Maybe there are some tricks on applying the convolution?\n2. In the section 3.4 (second paragraph), it seems that some subscripts are wrong (e.g., t^inv_d < t^inv_d < t^inv_l), which makes the physical constraint hard to understand. Can you state it more clearly?\n3. Although the space limitation can be a reason, I think it is necessary for a paper to have a conclusion.\n4. Just a question, will the dataset used in the paper be released to make the future work on this direction easier?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "In any given acoustic enclosure or a room, the sound produced at a certain location undergoes multiple reflections and travels a certain distance before arriving at a receiver kept elsewhere in the room. Because of this, the sound recived at a distant receiver is not the same as the sound at the source. One of the major problems in room acoustics is estimating the sound at a receiver at a known location given the original sound and the location of the sound sources under a specified room geometry. Typical signal processing methods employ ray tracing or wave tracing methods to account for reflections and under the linear time-invariant (LTI) model of a room, the impulse response between a source and a receiver with known locations (RIR) is estimated. The signal at the reciver would then be a simple convolution of the impulse response with the original source of sound. \n\nRecently, several authors have proposed using deep learning for estimating the RIR. The main drawback of such approaches is the need for a large labelled training set which maps source and receiver location to a specific RIR and this network would be trained specifically for a given enclosure. Different enclosures would need different networks. \n\nIn this work the authors propose to estimate the RIR between any two random locations based on sampling the room with up to 500 locations using a robot which would move to each location and record the audio along with receiver location. The authors propose to use this data to compute RIR between two receiver locations, instead of computing RIRs between a source and receiver using an MLP and a curious set of design choices. The paper is not very well written and needs effort to understand.  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Interesting idea to estimate Receiver to receiver Impulse response. \n\nWeakness:\n1. The overall design simply does not make sense. Irrespective of the reverberation properties of the enclosure the authors propose to estimate RIRs of length 257 samples corresponding to 16 kHz sampling rate. This amounts to an RIR of duration less then 20ms. Typical residential rooms would have reverberation time (RT60) - measured as the time taken for sound to reduce to 60 db from its original value after the sound source has stopped. Thus longer RIRs are needed to even characterize such room attributes. The choice of using the same MLP to predict RIR of 2 other virtual distances which twice and thrice farther apart is also not well justified and is presented with a hand wavy argument - simulating ray tracing method (ISM). It is not at all clear how the authors are calling whatever the network is estimating as RIR as there is no evaluation comparing this to actual RIR. \n2. Essentially this approach is mapping a location in space to an RIR using an MLP. This is an multi-valued function and as such admits multiple RIRs for the same location based on the source location which is ignored in this work. \n3. It is assumed that the robot would move to each location and capture the exact same audio each time. It is assumed that is easy for the robot to record its location. This obviously means the source of sound is being precisely controlled to start and stop and required times to make sure the robot records when it is stationary. This problem setup does not make any practical sense. It is hard to imagine a case where  it is hard to also jot down the source location. With a known source location the estimation would be so much well defined. \n4. I also believe with the limited sound source chosen for evaluation (7 clips in simulation and probably only 2 in real data) the network is simply memorizing and generalization is not well studied at all. From the appendix it is clear that the training and test locations, although different are roughly in the same neighborhood. \n5. The overall presentation is rather confusing with terms like \"inverse-RIR\" and \"Forward RIR\" and it feels like these terms are set arbitrarily and is rather confusing. \n",

The potential issues with this method include (1) this may not be a good way for dealing with early reflections and late reverberations; (2) how to choose these gain parameters in a practical scenario. In practice, the sound reflections from room surfaces can be from multiple directions. How can the gain parameters approximate these reflections or various time delays? Is there a principled way of choosing the gain parameters and are the two parameters a reasonable choice?\nThe authors showed the MSE and TF-MSE results, which can somewhat show how good is the performance of the compared methods, but may not be fully reflecting the truth. In the RIR shown in the paper, the early reflections seem to follow the direct sound immediately. I am expecting some time delays between the direct sound and early reflections, and also the early reflections are often more sparse than the late reflections. This does not seem to be case for the simulated RIR or the real room RIR. Not sure why the authors did not plot the ground truth RIR in the test case (considering the fact that they do have the ground truth RIRs that were used for computing the MSE). Showing both the estimated RIR and the ground truth can provide useful information on how good is the RIR learned by the network.     ",
