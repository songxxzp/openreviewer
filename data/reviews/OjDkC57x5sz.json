Showing that the heat dissipation process is a Gaussian diffusion one in the frequency domain. Based on this insight, the authors propose the \u201cblurring diffusion model\u201d, which explicitly defines latent variables of the intermediate diffusion steps in the frequency space. Experiments show comparable results with the DDPM and improved ones compared with IHDM. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The major contribution, to the best of my understanding, lies in the analysis of IHDM drawing its connection to denoising diffusion in frequency space, as well as the proposed latent variable model. Another interesting insight is that other deterministic transformations may be also applicable for destroying the signal. \nHowever, I\u2019m not completely sure about the significance of the contribution, especially in comparison with Rissanen et al. 2022. Perhaps I missed something important but it would be great if the authors could highlight the technical improvement / difference. \nI\u2019m not sure if the experimental result is convincing enough either. Checking the Ho et al. 2020, I realized that their simple loss already yielded an FID of 3.17 on CIFAR10, which is exactly the same as the reported performance of the blurring diffusion model. \n",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "*Strengths:*\n\n1. This is an interesting paper that bridges the gap between inverse heat dissipation (recently proposed by Rissanen et al.) and denoising models. The novelty lies in formulating the (de)blurring model as a Gaussian diffusion process with non-isotropic noise. This formulation is novel and complements the work by Rissanen.\n\n2. The experiments are brief, but demonstrate the strengths of the proposed approach. The visual quality of the generated samples (as well as FID scores) is impressive---especially if compared to that given by vanilla IHDM.\n\n3. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow. \n\n*Weaknesses:*\n\n4. The paper builds directly on Rissanen et al. (2022) for the deblurring part and Song's and Ho's work on denoising. The paper is written almost more as a technical note or technical comment on these existing works than an actual full paper. This, however, makes it easy to position the paper and follow the idea. \n\n5. The paper focuses largely on technical details, and it would have benefited from expanding on discussion points (e.g., the regularisation effect briefly covered in Sec. 6 and 7). Points on the lack of 'guarantees of convergence to the data distribution' (Sec. 1) appear vague and could be either expanded, removed, or rephrased. Additional discussion on the role of the neural network architecture and its role would have been interesting.\n\n6. Even if the presentation itself is clear, it appears slightly sloppy in parts, or written in haste. I would the authors to carefully go through the paper and fix in-text citations to read well.",

In pixel space, it has been shown that epsilon formulation is better. It would be a good ablation to show this holds in the frequency domain as well.\n2.
