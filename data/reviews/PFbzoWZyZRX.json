In Section 2: \"Inspired by these works, we incorporate the concept of calibration spike time into the conversion pipeline to bridge the gap between ANNs and SNNs.\" This sentence is too vague. The differences between the related works and the proposed work should be properly discussed in detail.\n3. All the figures are too small (in particular the legends). It is recommended to increase their size to make them readable.\n4. The description of the proposed method in Section 4 looks too vague and hard to follow. It is recommended to use algorithms, schemes, examples to ease the discussion. (To save space, the content of Section 3 can be moved to the appendix.)\n5.

Thus they propose an optimization method to reduce the offset spike by shifting up or down the initial membrane potential. Overall they achieve SOTA accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets with fewer time steps.",

The proposed framework is supported by theoretical analysis.\n\n4. The proposed method achieves SOTA performance in ANN2SNN conversion and comparable performance as BPTT with less computational cost.\n\nWeakness:\n1. All figures are too small to follow.\n\n2. The proposed method needs to take extra steps to acquire the remaining membrane potential, which decides the lower bound of the time steps.\n\n3. The paper lacks ablation experiments to show that the proposed shifting strategy is optimal.\n\nMore questions:\n\n1. The definition of offset spike (equation 8) lacks explanation. The authors should claim that they follow the QCFS framework with $\\lambda=\\theta$. Otherwise, it can not represent the gap between ANN and SNN output.\n\n2. It is interesting to see that the proposed method has an iterative property to reduce conversion error. However, why are the Ratio and MSE in Table 3 not zero after multiple iterations?\n\n3. Please add the ablation experiments to show that the proposed shifting strategy is optimal. The authors should compare it with other initialization strategies.\n\n4. The proposed method needs to take extra steps to acquire the remaining membrane potential. Can you comment on the implementation on Neuromorphic chips?\n\n5. I think figure 1 is under the condition of $T=L$. Am I right? How to rectify the firing rates of neurons in Figure 1c-d?\n\n6. Please clarify the value of L and T in Figure 3.",

Also, it would be better to provide a comprehensive comparison that incorporates this part with other conversion methods.\n\nThe key observation of using offset spikes for reducing conversion errors is derived from the QCFS function and IF model.
