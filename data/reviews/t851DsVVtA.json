Concretely, the authors consider three factors affecting the multimodal classification performance including the number of labeled training samples, the fitness of the conditional dependency structures to represent the true joint distribution, and the complexity of the discrimination task, where the $\\chi ^2-divergence$ is utilized to estimate the fitness of the conditional dependency structures. \nThe authors consider a model to learn the linear combination of the general dependency structure and conditional dependency structure estimators and propose an explicit analytical solution to get the optimal combination coefficient.\nThe authors not only show some theoretical analysis for designing the efficient multimodal algorithm but also provide experiment results to show the effectiveness of this algorithm.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n+ This paper writes well and explains the formulations and analytical results clearly.\n+ The authors first analyze the discrete scenarios and conclude some theoretical understanding for model designing with the formulation of optimal combination coefficient, then extend to the continuous scenarios to propose an autonomous updated coefficient on dependency structures algorithm by exploiting parametric models.\n+ The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- This work suggests models learn the linear combination of general dependency structure and conditional dependency structure estimators, which is a strong assumption, especially in multimodal scenarios, for example, in audio-visual scenarios, whatever the label is, it usually contains high temporal consistency between vision and sound.\n- The experiments only provide small-sale results, it cannot prove the conclusion useful for the large-scale dataset.\n- This paper point out three factors affecting the multimodal classification performance, but the results only demonstrate the results with different training samples sizes, however, in different datasets, the intrinsic sample structures are various, and the estimated $\\chi ^2-divergence$ in different datasets should also be provided to prove the algorithm.\n- The coefficient is estimated with training samples, however, the name of loss to estimate is $L_{test}$, which may be ambiguous.",

The introduction section is hard to follow in general. For instance, the introduction starts with the issue of insufficient training samples in multimodal learning. It is unclear how this can logically motivate the proposed optimal combination coefficients study.\n\n- Missing key background information. Eq 2 defines the combination coefficients alpha.

This makes the problem definition ungrounded and hard to follow.\n\n- Unclear key technical details. When calculating referenced x^2-divergence, how to obtain the ground-truth distribution P?\n\n- Experimental issues. All experiments are limited to two modalities.
