            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents a method to estimate 3D rotations of an object from images using classical physics. The paper is focused on predicting  satellite rotations. It uses Hamiltonian representation of rotational motion. With this representation, motion trajectory is differentiable everywhere. This is not true for rotation parametrisation using exponential or quaternion maps as the inverses may be discontinuous. The paper provides a 3D dataset of uniform and non-uniform cube and prism to train the method.\nThe method uses a set of sequential images to estimate rotation and angular velocities. It encodes images to low-dimensional space representing rotations (learnt during training phase) which are used to estimate angular velocity and predicts next image using Hamiltonian dynamics.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The use of hamiltonian dynamics is novel to the context of rotation estimation and trajectory prediction of satellites.\n2. A dataset has been proposed in order to learn 3D dynamics through images.\n3. The experiments show convincing results.\n\nWeakness:\n1. No evaluation on real data.\n2. In figure 4, it seems that the rotation estimation starts well and drifts away quickly. The rotation trajectory prediction is very off while the image prediction is quite decent. Do the images in fugure 3 (upto t=50) represent a small portion of the trajectory show on figure 4. More details are needed.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "I think that the writing is sufficiently comprehensible except in few sections. The main concepts are made quite clear. The limitations and failure cases have been discussed and the future works have been correctly identified. The authors will release the code upon acceptance to make the method reproducible. The main contribution is novel in the context of satellite trajectory estimation.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is definitely interesting. My only concern is the lack of evaluation on real data and the inability of method to deal with non-uniform data. \n\nAfter reading the rebuttal and discussion with other reviewers, I have changed my opinion (a bit unfavorably). Here are the main concerns:\n\n1. The experimentation is highly limited. The discussion on handling non-linear mass distribution is non-existent. The authors provide some explanation in the rebuttal but a lot questions remain. Given that the setup is difficult, perhaps the authors could explore non-linearity a bit more. For example, how does the method behave when the mass is non-uniform in a way that the centre of mass deviates strongly with respect to object centre. This discussion could have helped to understand the practical limitations of the method better. Plus, the authors must experiment with more data. Right now, the datasets are limited to a cube and a prism.\n\n2. There were some gaps in writing. The figure 2 in initial draft, which shows the trajectory to drift apart drastically, was later on removed. It is unclear to the readers how the registration works if the estimation of trajectory is so wrong. It is not clear whether the authors are performing a global alignment to fit into the projection. Perhaps the authors should have clarified.\n\nOverall, the paper has an important contribution over sota but the technical novelty is limited. Without a strong experimental evaluation, it was difficult to have an undoubted positive opinion.",

I struggle to understand why the predicted $S^{2}\\times S^{2}$ parameterisation of SO(3) is so different from the ground truth. In this setting there is a lot of prior knowledge used in the algorithm, namely we know that the system is a freely rotating rigid body. Therefore, as you emphasise, \"learning dynamics\" boils down to making good predictions. In figure 3 I observe seemingly good predictions that I can't really conciliate with figure 4, where trajectories clearly differ. Section 6.2 does not provide sufficient explanation for why this is the case.\n\nBecause of the freedom os assigning an inertial frame Eq. (4) (and the corresponding Lie-Poisson) and (2) are independent. It is not very clear why you need the latter system of equations? Technically you could perform predictions using only the quaternion equations. Is it only because you want to enforce energy conservation?
