            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to learn the dynamics of simple systems from visual observation. The proposed method is based on the detection of 2D keypoints in the image in an unsupervised way and the learning of the dynamics in its Lagrangian form. Prior knowledge of the structure of the problem is necessary.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "In my opinion, the novelty of the proposed method is extremely limited. I list below a several papers (sometimes absent from the cited references) comparable to the work presented:\n\n- [1] introduces a very similar framework for unsupervised 2D keypoint detection. The presented model is a simplification in that visual information is no longer extracted from a source image, but simply learned as a fixed latent vector. The model is therefore unlikely to generalize to basic changes in the scene, such as the background color.\n\n- [2] is an extension of [1] presenting a keypoint detection model for control. Their manipulation task is quite similar to those used in paper, although in my opinion more complex. This reference is missing from the paper, and yet seems very relevant.\n\n- [3] offers a different keypoint-based approach in a realistic environment for controlling a 3D robot arm. It seems to me that the method is comparable with this reference (also missing from the citations), and address a much more complex problem.\n\n- [4] and [5] also propose to learn the dynamics of complex systems from the discovery of unsupervised 2D keypoints. However, these two papers use a much more challenging counterfactual context, and address 3D problems.\n\nMore generally, the paper is quite difficult to read, section 2 and 3, as well as figures 3 and 4 can in my opinion be re-worked to make understanding easier. Deep understanding of [1], [2] and cited works on Deep Lagrangian models feel absolutely necessary to fully understand the proposition. I list below  several remarks concerning the method:\n\n- The use of strong and demanding prior knowledge on the geometry of the problem seems to be a very strong assumption. Adding its constraints unsurprisingly improves overall performance, as a big part of the dynamic is manually encoded into the network. However, I wonder how precise these constraints need to be. It would have been interesting to show that the use of partial or slightly erroneous constraints made it possible to maintain good performance.\n\n- The authors detail in equation 11 the formula used to estimate the speed of keypoints by finite difference. The authors have chosen to use a forward Euler diagram, in other words, the speed (i) already contains the information of the position at the instant (i+1)! This effect fades when the prediction is made over a longer horizon, but it is a fairly significant design flaw.\n\n- The scenarios chosen to evaluate the model seem terribly simple to me regarding the tasks that SOTA address with this type of keypoints-based model (see references given above). These are simulated 2D problems, with relatively simple dynamics, with very simple visual output (no occlusion, constant background, fixed geometry, etc.)\n\n- It would have been interesting to study in more detail the behavior of detected keypoints. I wonder for example (1) what is the contribution of the BCE on the heatmaps, (2) what is the impact of the increase/reduction of the number of keypoints (3) Is the application of \"transformation of the $D_4$ dihedral group\" to $z$ useful in practice? It also seems to me that given the constraints on the keypoints, the learned dynamics should be very close to the physical equations, but this is not discussed in the paper.\n\n[1] Jakab, T., Gupta, A., Bilen, H., & Vedaldi, A.

The keypoint extractor extracts cartesian coordinates on the individual bodies. The consecutive dynamics model utilizes the key points to learn the constrained dynamics of these bodies. In addition, the proposed algorithm enforces Lagrangian dynamics on each body. In contrast to prior work, this paper uses a keypoint extractor while the other approaches utilized a VAE. Within the experiments, the authors show that the proposed algorithm can learn a good dynamics model.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Dear authors, greeting from your Neurips reviewers. Please keep in mind that the review community for this topic is not soo big. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that you get the same reviewers. This paper deeply frustrates me, as this paper is soo close to the finish line but it seems like you cannot push it over the finish line. You had 2 months and 4 good reviews to adapt the paper. Some of the NEURIPS reviews might be a bit harsh on the baselines but overall fair, positive, and constructive. However, you decided to do very little and resubmit mostly the same paper. Yes, you cut a few equations, added a baseline (that nobody asked for), and reported VPT for no-actuation, under-actuated, and fully actuated. However, you failed to add a qualitative comparison of the prediction. You could easily plot the trajectories in phase space, which would enable a qualitative comparison, and plot the constraint violation of the key points. Another fun idea would have been to infer the constraints from the key points which should be straightforward (when the key points are good) compared to hard-coding the constraints. I still find the approach of learning dynamics from pixels but simultaneously requiring the knowledge of the kinematic chain a weird combination. Looking at the videos in the `extra_predictions` does not increase my confidence in the methods. The time horizons are very short and it often fails horribly for the under-actuated and un-actuated versions. \n\nI would urge the reviewers to go back to the NEURIPS reviews and see how the paper could be improved. To refresh your mind, this is the NEURIPS Meta reviews which provide a good summary and positiveness of the different reviewers. Unfortunately, the meta reviewer was a bit too confident as the work was not `substantially improved` but resubmitted with minor changes. \n\n> While all reviewers agree with the novelty and interestingness of this research direction, in its current form, my assessment is that it would make a good workshop paper proposing a 1st step into the direction of learning Lagrangian dynamics from images. The results are still in early stages, e.g. experiments using the simplest DM_control environments (even requiring modifications from the authors on friction to make it work). As uztn noted, \u201cthe system is built from parts that are well-described in the prior work, as described by the authors. The resulting system will not work outside of simple 2D, fully observable systems, and the generations produced are of comparable or lower quality than generations of dynamic systems both in and outside of the physically-inspired dynamics modeling community.\u201d\n>\n> I also agree with reviewer sEpU that a comparison to video-prediction models (or image-based \u201cworld models\u201d) is not outside the scope, since people will want to know where the approach stands compared with traditional methods (even at lower performance). As the reviewer mentioned, experiments which enable the comparison to other methods such as control / video-prediction, which are not necessarily Lagrangian-based or are Lagrangian based but do not learn from images (to answer questions like \"how much does the use of the Lagrangian improve the video-prediction/control performance\" or \"how large is the performance drop by learning from images instead states directly\") will be tremendously useful to achieve high impact within the broader ML research community.\n> \n> I look forward to seeing the authors improve the work, as we all agree that the direction is novel and I\u2019m confident that the work will be substantially improved going forward.\n",
