The authors have obtained the threshold parameter to analyze the model equilibria and its stability. They also analyzed a model for hepatitis B virus transmission with optimal control. Some developed algorithms and numerical simulations were carried out  to validate the theoretical results.",

To me, it seems to be more appropriate for a journal in mathematical biology or ...\n\n2) On page 2, Theorem 1:\n- $H_3$ is not correct (its last row is incorrect)\n- $H_n$ should be written in a more general form, please see the following references:\n\n[1] S\u00fcli, E., Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. Lecture note, University of Oxford, (2013).\n\n[2] F. R. Gantmacher, L. B. Joel, Applications of the Theory of Matrices, Courier Corporation, (2005).\n\n3) The graph presented in Figure 1 is not well explained, and so the modeling of the system (4)-(5) is unclear. \n\n4) In Section 4, the authors have referred to Lyapunov function theory to investigate the global dynamics/stability of the model. However, if I understood correctly, this method is not explicitly employed in this paper (and the stability analysis has been performed using\nlinearization and Hurwitz criteria). Hence, the authors should make explicit the use of Lyapunov function theory in their work.\n\n5) On page5, Theorem 2 is **incorrect**. The mentioned condition on $R_0$ is not sufficient for asymptotically stability. The proof of Theorem is not correct either. If  $R_0 < 1$  and $a_3,a_4 >0$ , then all the determinants of the Hurwitz matrices cannot necessarily be positive. For instance, under the mentioned conditions, $H_2$ does not always have a positive determinant.\n\n",

To show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm, both theoretical support and empirical evaluations are provided. However, this work can be further improved in the following aspects:\n\n\u2022 According to the authors, the motivation of this paper is to study the strategies to forecast and control hepatitis B virus transmission. However, based on the data from CDC and WHO, Hepatitis B is not a major threat to us now. Compared to COVID, its transmission rate is not that high, and it is a vaccine-preventable disease. I am not sure if the study for control hepatitis B virus transmission at this point is essential or necessary.\n\n[1] https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b.htm\n[2] https://www.who.int/health-topics/hepatitis#tab=tab_1\n\n\u2022 I have concerns for the novelty of the proposed model and algorithm. Compartmental epidemics models have been well developed. Besides classical SIS or SIR model, there already be some works which divided infectious stages to two separate stages, also the stability of such models have been studied [3] [4]. Compare to these work, I didn\u2019t see much novelty or improvement form this paper. In my opinion, it may be able to bring limited insights to the optimization and epidemics community.\n\n[3] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12923.pdf\n[4] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3590621\n\n\u2022 Figure 1 is not vector graph, it should be updated.\n\u2022 The writing of this work can be further polished. There exists a lot of grammar issues.\n\u2022 This paper is not well-organized. Some of the sections are not consistent with the other part. For example, in Section 2.2, it is not clear why this principle is needed in the whole framework. Also, this section is not stated clearly, where the dynamical from and why there will an optimal problem were not clear. Besides, there exist a lot of long paragraphs which are not easy to follow. For instance, the two paragraphs in introduction, and the two paragraphs in numerical simulation. \n\u2022 In the numerical simulations, how these parameter values are chosen is not clear.\n\u2022 The format of Table 1 should be updated to meet the requirement of the conference.\n",
