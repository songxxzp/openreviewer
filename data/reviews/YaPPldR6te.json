            "summary_of_the_paper": "The problem tackled is that of the decay in performance of BCI systems over time. The article presents an analysis of an electrocorticography data set (n=6) used for brain-computer interface, and in particular discusses the importance of the different features used by a predictive model built with machine learning techniques.\nFour different models are put to the test and the one exhibiting highest prediction rates is further analyses to decode the importance of the different features.\nAlthough ML is popular for BCI applications, I agree with the statement that for the specific case of boosting longitudinal stability of the BCI its application is novel.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\n+ The problem studied is clear and remains open and the study proposed in this draft is a clear contribution to the field.\n+ The introduction is entertaining and of adequate depth, the literature review is extensive and its use throughout the article is excellent, the methodology is solid, the results are clear, the discussion (embedded within the results) is interesting, and the article has high nomological validity.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nNot many\u2026\n+ Absence of inferential statistics, and even the descriptive statistics is incomplete. For example, the standard deviations of the different statistics are not described, the statistical power analysis is not described, etc.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "This is certainly one of the strengths of the paper. Except for a couple of aspects that I would like to ask for more detail, but certainly this paper scores high on all; clarity, quality, novelty, and reproducibility. Regarding that couple of aspects:\n+ Why is the 6th rat considered useful for \u201cexternal validity\u201d yet there Is no evidence or explanation that this rat would be statistically different from the first 5, and certainly the surgery date is not a factor affecting the neural responses of the rodent, is it? If the rat is then statistically similar to the others (besides the natural inter-subject variability for which the other rats may be as different for all that I understand) then there is no reason to accept the 6th subject as useful for claiming external validity and it might be better to use it to increase the internal validity.\n+ 1000 replication for 95% statistical power seems pretty large even for small effect sizes. No further details of the power analysis is given. Can the authors indicate how was this calculated? Is perhaps the study overpowered?\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "+ Without an analysis of error propagation it is difficult to anticipate how far in the long term would the predictive power of the model hold within useful boundaries.\n+ There appears to be no measure of the degradation of the performance of the xML pipelines as the prediction horizon is further away.\n+ Cross-correlated variables were removed. Were corrections considered (as opposed to simply dropping) e.g. statistical whitening, Bayesian multivariate decoupling, ARIMA models with a cross-variate feed, etc?\n+ The explanatory approach methods taken here (SHAP and decision paths) is actually very insightful and in principle is generic, hence it could be translated to other BCI modalities; e.g. EEG based, fNIRS based, etc. What adaptations would be suggested to do so?\n+ Although the translation to humans is identified as one of the limitations of the study, I can see how rather than a limitation of this study that makes up for a different study altogether. In this sense, my question is a bit more humble, regardless of the length of the BCI intervention, and focusing strictly on the predictive horizon of the model (currently shown at 15 weeks for the rats), is it likely to be at least equally long in humans? Even if it is only for 15 weeks, that remains a quite reasonable horizon in humans, but unfortunately, with a much more complex nervous system, I reckon the decay of the performance of the predictive models might suffer more heavily?.\n\n\nMinor details\n+ Figures looks grainy on my end (although readable). Not sure whether this is only on my side, but just in case it does not cost much to double check.\n+ AI and ML are closely related but not the same. The authors seem to use explainable machine learning and explainable artificial intelligence interchangeably. If this is intentional, I\u2019m fine with it. If not, why not stick to only one of them? Subjectively I would say this paper in particular is closer to xML rather than xAI but I wouldn\u2019t argue with other perceptions.\n+ Some of the things explaining the figures are in the main text. Of course, every author has its style and I do not want to interfere. But if there is no strong preference, may I suggest to move such parts to the figure caption to make the images self-contained?\n\n",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The collected data is very interesting and useful for the proposed task (predicting dead channels and explaining what factors influence dead channels). The analysis is sound and well-conducted. \n\nHowever, I think that the claims made in the paper are a little too strong. \n\nThe claim, in the abstract, that \"Predicting whether a channel will have sortable units across time would mitigate this issue and increase the utility of these devices by reducing uncertainty, yet to-date, no such methods exist\" is not true. This has been done (see for example Spike sorting pipeline for the International Brain Laboratory, IBL, 2022), with a method predicting bad channels in Neuropixels probes based on similarity with neighboring channels. I agree that this is different from the work in this paper but it would be worth explaining the difference a little better. \n\nAlso, I think it would be straightforward to extend the author's analysis to high-density probe recordings where dead channels can be detected, to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction. \n\nI would have liked to see a schematic of the experiments, showing a diagram of the probe (it is hard to know what the probe looks like from the text), and also explain the features that are input to the model in more depth. I couldn't understand if the authors use all the spikes info, and how they calculate SNR, amplitude or magnitude for the channels. \n\nThe novelty of the approach is that the model predicts dead channels using features like Subject/time post implantation, that have a high SHAP value. However, lots of additional features could have been used and the selection of features seems bit arbitrary. Why use channel's amplitude and SNR? Having a model that solely predicts the dead channels using info that is not contained in the signal would be much more impressive and informative. Moreover, I think it should be easy to get higher accuracy when using signal info. \n\nFinally, it seems to me that \"time post-implantation\" is obviously important to predict dead channels, as well as \"Subject\" and it does not really inform us about the reason why a channel dies (i.e. Subject could mean many different things - such as a problem when implanting the probe or else), which make the conclusions a little less informative. \n\n\n\n",
