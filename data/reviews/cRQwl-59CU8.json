            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a unified information extraction (UIE) framework based on the token pair classification idea. The UIE solution allows modeling all types of IE tasks such as NER, RE and EE with just one unified model. Also the authors propose a Plusformer on top of the token-pair feature matrix for better feature learning. They show their method advances better efficacy and efficiency. The proposal of UIE simplified with a token pair scheme is technically sound, and also the experiments are solid. However, I'm afraid this paper may suffer from some key flaws, with respect to the topic of UIE, which I list bellow.\n\n\n1. Overall, this paper made limited contributions.\n\na. Token pair classification, aka., table filling/grid tagging, is one of the most typical and long-standing task modeling schemes for the information extraction jobs in NLP community.\nAlso, the paper claims to advance with unifying all IE tasks, yet the idea of token pair classification has been well explored in NER [2], RE [1] and EE [3].\nThus this paper leverages such a method for UIE, which in the perspective of technique, contributes less.\n\nb. The proposed Plusformer is simply the combination of CNN layer with axis-aware addition. The module is designed for modeling the local interaction. However as far as I know, this will fall short on modeling some of the long-range dependences between elements for especially the RE/EE tasks [5].\n\n\n\n2. Problematic/unconvincing motivations\n\na. The authors indicate the issues of the existing works: \"However, these models are either complex to be designed or time-consuming to decode\", which could be problematic. For example, generative seq2seq methods are very easy and straightforward, while graph-based methods enjoy high running efficiency due to high parallel architecture.\n\nb. The motivation and designing detail of the use of token pair in this paper is essentially the same as the recent work [2], while the authors seem to skip [2] without acknowledging it, which is unacceptable.\n\nc. Suspicious unified IE. I don't feel that the task modeling should be called as unified information extraction, since it seems different task types (NER/RE/EE) come with one specific task formalization. [4] models all different IE tasks with just one real single unified formulation under a well-designed structured extraction language/expression.\n\nAnd also the paper writing or technique description is not clear, e.g.,\n1) Y [s, e, t] = Y [e, s, t] , what does the [*] mean?\n2) how to solve the issue of overlapping elements in NER/RE/EE with your formulization?\n3) the task formulization lacks necessary examples for certain IE tasks.\n\n\n3. Another potential problem in the technique method part: one of the key reasons to propose UIE in IE community lies in the capability of knowledge transfer, i.e., pre-training once and transferring everywhere, to naturally support few-shot learning for downstream IE task. But the UIE in this paper seems to fail to well support this advantage; they more likely perform unified IE task modeling, and nothing more. This would limit the real merit of UIE.\n\n\n4. As an extension of token pair based IE method, this work didn't survey the existing works for this line, e.g., differences.\nAlso some critical existing works are overlooked [1,2,3].\n\n\n\n[1] Modeling Joint Entity and Relation Extraction with Table Representation.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": " - In the abstract, it is a stretch to claim to unify all IE tasks as there are only 4 tasks in the experiment setting.\n\n - Using the start and end token of the span as a representation is common practice for information extraction and relation extraction.\n\n - It is not clear why the CNN is limited to kernel size 3.\n\n - In Table 4, it is not clear what is the difference between UTC-IE without \u201caxis-aware\u201d and CNN-IE which does not have PlusAttention.\n",

It would be better if the authors could provide some visualization examples on axis-aware attention and location interaction attention. The authors could also provide qualitative examples of how this new attention mechanism helps with performance.\n* In equation (4), it is unclear the concatenation of Z_h and Z_v is along which axis.\n* In Section 4.3, the author mentioned that \u201cthe performance of UTC-IE_single is from trigger/argument F1 of EE\u201d; however, the trig. (and arg. F1) score for UTC-IE_single on ERE-EN in Table 2 is 57.01 (and 48.29), while the trig. (and arg. F1) score for UTC-IE on ERE-EN in Table 1 is 60.20 (and 52.51).
