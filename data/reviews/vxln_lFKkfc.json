            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors study the problem of estimating treatment effect heterogeneity when the subgroup indicators are unknown (e.g. sick versus healthy). In particular, the researcher knows that treatment effect heterogeneity only depends on the latent subgroup indicators, which are functions of observed covariates, but does not know how many subgroups there are and which subgroup each individual belongs to. The goal is to recover the correct number of subgroups, the effect for each subgroup, and to assign each individual to the correct subgroup. The authors propose an algorithm based on clustering and prove that it asymptotically achieves these three goals under seven assumptions.",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity\n\n*The algorithm intuition is very clear\n\n*Why is equation (2) about ATT instead of ATE? Relatedly, in the algorithm, isn\u2019t the average of ITEs the ATE rather than the ATT? This was confusing\n\n*The discussion of the difference between ATT and EFF used diction that is atypical in causal inference. A more typical discussion would say that under the stated identifying assumptions, ATT and EFF do not coincide. \u201crendering ATT useless\u201d is a bit of a jarring expression.\n\n*Some statements are too loose. \u201cIf unbiased counterfactual estimation is not possible, then any form of causal effect analysis is doomed.\u201d Do the authors mean selection bias? Regularization bias? Either way, causal analysis is not doomed\u2014there are entire literatures about how to correct for both biases. Please clarify which bias is being considered and fix the language.\n\n*A figure would be helpful to visualize the different steps of the algorithm. \n\n*I found this sentence to be confusing: \u201cthe counterfactual estimates use a predictor learned from the independent control population\u201d. Is that the untreated subpopulation? Something else? Please clarify\n\nQuality\n\n*I crudely checked the results, but they seem rigorous\n\n*I was surprised that the results did not appeal to smoothness of h or compactness of X_c. Is this not required for inverting h?\n\n*A6 seems to be a strong assumption. Please discuss or formally sketch why this assumption is plausible. It would be nice to comment further on how the curse of dimensionality appears in A6. e^d N_{impure}<\u2026 seems to be the constraint. Is that correct?\n\n*Overall, the strongest assumption seems to be that the treatment effect heterogeneity only depends on C, an integer, and the analyst knows this fact. This is formally stated in A2, but the introduction somehow didn\u2019t convey this point forcefully enough.\n\nNovelty\n\n*The authors introduce the language of effect and side effect, but the overall goal is closely tied to a known problem that goes by several names: sorted group average treatment effect, classification analysis, and endogenous stratification analysis. I would like the authors to compare their problem statement with the problem statement of sorted group average treatment effect in Chernozhukov-Demirer-Duflo-Fernandez Val (2018). This reference also provides a thorough discussion of related works that are relevant for this submission and worth citing.\n\n*While the problem is related to existing problems, the solution seems to me to be innovative and interesting.",

Therefore, \u201csome (often most) treated subjects are healthy (p.2)\u201d, and this greatly confounds the estimation of ATT. This paper provides asymptotically consistent algorithm for accurately estimating the treatment effect, and demonstrate its value numerically with synthetic data.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "- A stronger justification of the practical significance of non-targeted trials could be greatly beneficial. In particular, although self-selection is indeed a well-known in e.g. natural experiments on digital platforms, it is a bit difficult for me to image self-selection problem would occur in clinical trials, where experimental units are recruited through a careful and rigorous process where doctors are usually involved. Therefore, perhaps a concrete clinical situation should be carefully elaborated, or relevant literature should be cited in the paper to substantiate the importance of this somewhat non-canonical situation. It is also important to show the situation of non-targeted trial is sufficiently common, so that any new method being developed for this situation is worth much attention.\n- The algorithm in Section 2 looks like a algorithm for estimating heterogeneous treatment effect, but HTE is fundamentally different from the clinical sick/healthy subjects setting because usually it is pretty clear whether a patient is sick or healthy.\n- The algorithm is a combination of cluster analysis and off-the-shelf estimation of individual ITE. Both methods are well known, so synthetic analysis could\u2019ve taken less proportion because it is unlikely that the two methods would go wrong, especially the simulation setting is simplistic with dimension 2. On the other hand, real data analysis is necessary in order to evidence the value of the algorithm in application.",
