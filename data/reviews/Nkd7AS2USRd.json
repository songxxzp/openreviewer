I.e. when tracking the diffusion process through time does it recapitulate a folding process? I understand that the angle parametrization is closer to the native process, but that doesn't necessarily mean them model will learn to follow this process when denoising (clashes etc.) \n- Could the authors elaborate on why to use ESM-IF1 over alternatives such as ProteinMPNN, and why to generate exactly 8 sequences?",

Therefore, it's hard to compare how much better this model does compared to previous works. My suggestion is to produce a set of comprehensive samples, and compare them to other techniques that way.\n- Many metrics selected are claims about overall statistics, not individual proteins. The few samples shown are underwelming\n- The scTM score provided is underwhelming as well, having most scores significantly lower than 0.5. For well generated proteins, I would expect >0.8 to be reasonable. RMSD might be a more interpretable metric to display also - for which we're looking for sub 3 A self consistency.\n- The model seems unable to generate beta sheets, which require the model to better understand the global structure of the protein.\n- Why does the generated samples not show any secondary structure through pymol?

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "### Clarity\nThe paper is clearly written and structured. Mathematical notation follows standards in the field. Figures are well designed. \n\n### Novelty\n\nThe paper introduces a novel representation of proteins in terms of torsional angles and a diffusion process on it. The paper introduces a new problem and task: to generate new foldable protein structures.  As such, these novelties clearly lie within the application area which limits the relevance and significance for the broader ML field. \n\nQ: Can the authors include more references to representations of protein structures? There might be ones that suggest a similar representation. \n\n### Quality\n\n\nA) Lack of baselines and compared methods. The authors only present a single method and architecture that performs the generative modeling on the proposed representation. However, there are baseline methods that should be compared, e.g. just training a transformer or LSTM in autoregressive (AR) mode to predict the next angles (in other words: using AR models instead of diffusion models). A naive baseline (\u201cBM\u201d) should be the following: sampling one protein structure from the training set and putting minimal amount of noise on the angles. Or some simple baseline that just used empirical distributions of the angles and samples from it. Furthermore, the authors mention several other methods that generate foldable protein structures (Section 2.1): those should definitely be compared against the proposed method.\n\nB) The proposed metric is insufficient because it can easily be tricked with a simple method. The baseline method BM, suggested above, should be good at all proposed metrics: Figure 2-4, and also with respect to developability and scTM score. Thus,  the presented metrics can only be used for a sanity check if the model has learned something useful. A similar problem with evaluation occurs in generating images and this is a fundamental problem of evaluating generative models in continuous spaces or how to assess the amount of novelty. In computer vision, there is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), with variants for audio and video, and for small molecules the Frechet ChemNet Distance (FCD) that is used to assess unconditional generation. I believe that there is no way around a similar approach to come up with a metric for this task. \nThe authors should improve the metrics and demonstrate that naive methods cannot reach high performance values on these metrics. \n\nC) Lack of repetitions, confidence intervals, and error bars. It appears that all metrics, figures, and tables show the result of a single run of the method. Therefore, these might arise just by chance and another run could produce a completely different picture. The authors should perform re-runs for their proposed method and all baselines and compared methods. \n\n### Reproducibility\nThe authors have uploaded code as supplementary data, which should make the work well reproducible \n\n### Minor Comments\n- Concerning the statement of designability of the generated structures, it is mentioned that a similar approach as Trippe et al. (2022) was used for evaluation, but Alphafold (Jumper et al., 2021) instead Omegafold (Wu et al., 2022) was used. \n- For benchmarking purposes it is preferable to use the same scheme as the method to compare with.\n- For Figure 3 it states that the lines are artefacts of null values, there is no discussion why they look shifted for the generated structures, regarding angle phi.\n- Comparison between Omegafold (Wu et al., 2022) and Alphafold (Jumper et al., 2021), to have a better benchmark to former works.\n\n\n### References\n[1] Heusel, M., Ramsauer, H., Unterthiner, T., Nessler, B., Klambauer, G., & Hochreiter, S.

By considering each residue to be its own reference frame, it describes protein backbone structure as a series of consecutive angles capturing the relative orientation of the constituent amino acid residues instead of Cartesian atom coordinates. A vanilla transformer is used to build a diffusion model to generate new protein structures by denoising from a random, unfolded state towards a stable folded structure. Some experiments indicate resulting model generates lifelike protein, better-respecting protein chirality.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "1. This paper proposes a simplified framing of protein backbones . Unlike viewing a protein backbone of amino acids as a cloud of 3D coordinates, authors view it as a sequence of six internal, consecutive angles. The independence of reference frame of each residue leads to no need to use an equivariant neural network. No matter how the protein is rotated or shifted, the angle of the next residue given the current residue never changes.\n2. As mentioned before, no requirements of the use of equivariant networks leads to the possibility of using simple transformer as the backbone architecture, thus the model directly generates structures without relying on additional methods for refinement. Generated backbones exhibit greater designability compared to prior works that use equivariance assumptions.\n3. It presents a suite of validations to quantitatively demonstrate that unconditional sampling from proposed model directly generates realistic protein backbones \u2013 from recapitulating the natural distribution of protein inter-residue angles, to producing overall structures with appropriate arrangements of multiple structural building block motifs.\n4. Abundant numerical experiments are supplied to demonstrate that generated backbones contain reasonable structural motifs and they are designable.\n\n**Questions:**\n1. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been shown via solid experiments. The potential advantages can be known from an explanation of the paper, but there seems to be less compared with other models in terms of performance and prediction results, could you please provide more valid evidence?\n2. Although formulating a protein as a series of angles enables to use simpler models without equivariance mechanisms, this framing allows accumulated errors to significantly alter the overall structure of a generated structure. Could you further analyze the impact of this cumulative error compared to other noise errors based on Cartesian coordinate systems on the prediction results? Does additional refinement similar to the original approach help improve reliability?\n3. The generated structures are still simple compared to natural proteins which typically have several hundred residues and it is of static structures. Could you please further explain the possibility and operability of the proposed model in terms of further extensions?\n\n",
