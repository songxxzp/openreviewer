However, this does not seem to be a realistic scenario, and I fail to see what conclusion is drawn from this experiment. Can you clarify why it's reasonable to assume the covariance matrices to be orthogonal?\n2) There is no theoretical comparison to prior methods in terms empirical or population risk.

The goal of DP is not to have zero risk, but rather to have a bounded risk.\n- In Definition 2.4: there is a broken reference, and $\\Phi$ is not defined.\n- The captions for Tables 1-2 seems to be reversed.\n- Regarding the experiments: Section 4.1 assumes that $X$ is uniform in (0, 1), but the analysis of Sections 2-3 assumes a Gaussian design matrix.
