However, in practice, this might not be the case, since the model of language might not be perfectly known. Hence, for most practical scenarios this approach might not provide perfectly secure steganography.  \n(-) While the results in Figure 2 are close to zero, they are not exactly zero. Does this mean that perfect security is not obtained as claimed?  \n(-) The authors evaluated the security of their approach empirically, however, it is not clear if this method can withstand modern steganalysis methods [A, B, C, D], or human evaluation.   \n\n[A] Modern Text Hiding, Text Steganalysis, and Applications: A Comparative Analysis; Entropy. 2019  \n[B] Linguistic Steganalysis With Graph Neural Networks; IEEE Signal Processing Letters. 2021  \n[C] A fast and efficient text steganalysis method; IEEE Signal Processing Letters. 2019  \n[D] Exploiting language model for efficient linguistic steganalysis; ICASSP 2022  \n",
