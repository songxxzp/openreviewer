Theoretical analysis is provided.\n                  3. Empirical results showed outperformed performance. \n\nWeaknesses: 1. I think the current version takes too much space on the theoretical analysis while ignoring the model itself. Figure 2 is not clear to me. \n                      2. For the Merfish data experiment, what's the reason to downsample the gene number from 4000 to 1000? In real situations, the gene number can be millions. If the proposed method can not deal with high-dimensional features, then the scalability will be an issue. \n                      3. What's the criteria for GEASS to select 9 genes in Merfish data?

Experiment results show superior performance on both synthetic and real data, further validating the effectiveness of the model.\n \nWeakness: First of all, in section 3.2, the author mentioned that \u201cGEASS provides both outputs of active features and embeddings produced by causally interacting features. In this paper, we emphasize the use of the former as the latter embedding output may be complex and nonlinear, potentially requiring additional architectures to maximize its interpretability.\u201d The statement is confusing as it did not specify where the \u201cembeddings produced by causally interacting features\u201d were obtained: whether they were from the stochastic gates, or the MLPs indicated in Fig. 2? Further, there are no explanations for the design and purpose of the MLPs in Fig. 2.  Also, the term \u201cSTG layer\u201d in Fig. 2 has never been mentioned throughout the manuscript.
