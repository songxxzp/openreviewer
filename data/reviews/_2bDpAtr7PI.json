            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper describes a novel SO(3) equivariant architecture for pose prediction of objects from 2D images. The neural network takes image features from an image encoder and maps it to a sphere, which is followed by an $S^2$ convolution and one or more $SO(3)$ convolutions. Both these layers are equivariant to $SO(3)$ transformations. An important feature is that the output of the neural network is a distribution on the $SO(3)$ pose manifold. This feature is important in the case where the objects have symmetries and the pose can be known only up to that symmetry. Experiments on multiple pose prediction datasets show improved performance over baselines as well as the ability to produce distributions that show understanding of object symmetries.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1. The proposed architecture and loss function -- I2S -- are simple and intuitive. \n\n2. The paper is well-written with good illustrations and visualizations of results for important cases that show the usefulness of the I2S and that I2S works predictably for some known objects, which is important.\n\n3. Experiments on multiple datasets show that I2S indeed outperforms all the baselines considered almost always.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. Novelty of the method: Given that both $SO(3)$-equivariant convolutions as well as pose prediction by predicting distributions over $SO(3)$ are existing ideas, I am not sure that the architecture in this paper is novel enough.\n\n2. Comparison with Murphy (2021): Experiments on SYMSOL indicate that Murphy (2021) outperforms I2S when the entire dataset is available. However, I2S performs better in a few-shot setting. I think the authors should try to clarify why exactly mapping to the sphere and then the SO(3) is important, this seems to be the main difference from Murphy (2021), which is not clear in the current version of the paper. \n\n3. Experimental results should have error bars and statistical significance values.\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, I think the paper studies an important problem in computer vision, and proposes a simple and effective architecture, which takes into account symmetries in the objects for pose prediction. I do think some of the experimental results and novelty of the paper have to be explained and done better. I am inclining towards acceptance.\n\nUPDATE AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE:\n\nI appreciate that the authors have responded too all my comments. I think the paper is in good shape to be accepted although architectural novelty is limited. It does show how to use existing spherical and SO(3) convolutional layers for an important problem and shows some improvements in performance. I am increasing my rating based on the authors' response to my comments and those of the other reviewers. ",

This is done by first mapping the image features onto a sphere using orthographic projection, and then a learned filter is applied to transform the signal onto SO(3). Finally, SO(3) group convolution is performed to produce the distribution over the 3D rotation space. Thanks to the SO(3) equivariant group convolution operation, the pose estimation distribution can be modeled well in the results. The method is evaluated on several image-based orientation estimation results and the proposed method is reported to outperform prior methods and other baselines, especially in a low data regime. ",

The paper aims to solve an interesting and challenging problem: estimating 3-D pose from 2-D images, which has broad applications in 3-D computer vision and 3-D imaging.\n\nWeaknesses and questions:\n\n1. Although the writing is in general ok, there are some missing details in the implementation. I encourage authors to provide a more detailed description of each layer and operations in the proposed neural network. For example, the authors did not clarify how exactly equation (2) is implemented in the Fourier space of SO(3).\n\n2. The idea of this work is not sufficiently motivated. I can see the advantages of learning the distribution of SO(3) can mitigate the issue of symmetry. However, it remains unclear how the S2 convolution and the operations shown in Figure 2 are essential to the success of the proposed method. More explainations and experiments are expected to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module of the proposed network.\n\n3. The idea of this work is not novel. It seems to me that proposed method is a combination of ideas from previous works such as group convolution,  Fourier expansion on SO(3) and etc. Learning distribution on SO(3) to break symmetry is also not a new idea, see [1].\n\n4. The proposed method is not the only work that predicts rotations from 2-D images, so there are some missing references. See [2] that uses each 2-D image to predict the pose of protein molecule for 3-D reconstruction. I also encourage the authors to have some discussions that compare this work with your method, since they are able to obtain reliable pose estimates from 2-D images using a simple neural network.\n\n[1] Synchronizing Probability Measures on Rotations via Optimal Transport.\n\n[2] CryoAI: Amortized Inference of Poses for Ab Initio Reconstruction of 3D Molecular Volumes from Real Cryo-EM Images",
