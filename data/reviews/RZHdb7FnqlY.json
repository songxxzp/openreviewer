They prove that existing of-the-shelf deepfake detectors trained on GAN-generated images generalize badly to DM-generated deepfakes, while they can be effectively adapted to DM domain through fine-tuning. The authors further analyze the differences between the fake images generated by GAN and DM in the frequency domain, showing that DM-generated images exhibit unique characteristics.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1.  High-fidelity fake images generated by recent diffusion models have become a new threat in deepfake area. This paper presents a pioneer, systematic examination of this scenario with well-designed experiments.\n2.  The authors provide several interesting observations from two different views: 1) the feasibility of detecting DM deepfakes using existing methods and 2) the characteristics of DM-generated images in frequency domain. These observations prove that DM deepfakes are more challenging to detect and have quite unique characteristics compared to GAN deepfakes, which brings useful insights to both deepfake detection and DM-based generation community.\n3. The paper is overall well-written. All experiment details are presented clearly in the manuscript and supplementary materials with elaborate analysis.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nMost of the main experiments are relatively simple and trivial. More in-depth analysis could be done to obtain richer and more complete conclusions. Specifically, I have the following suggestions:\n\n1. In section 5.2, the authors make an interesting observation that detectors trained on DM-generated images can generalize better to GAN deepfakes than vice versa. They thus hypothesize that this is because detecting DM deepfakes is a more challenging task. Although the hypothesis seems to be supported by frequency domain analysis, a more intuitive interpretation might be achieved by further analysis on the feature space, e.g., a comparison between distributions of DM/GAN-generated features extracted by DM-trained detectors and GAN-trained detectors.\n\n2. In section 6.2, the authors compare the effectiveness of detecting DM and GAN deepfakes in frequency domain using a simple logistic regression approach. However, some existing deepfake detection works absorb frequency info in a more 'soft' way, e.g. [1]. These frequency-aware deepfake methods' performance on DM deepfakes could also be examined. Will they perform better or worse on DM deepfakes than GAN deepfakes? Will the conclusion made in section 5.1 and 5.2 keep the same?\n\n3. Most existing deepfake datasets (FF++, DFDC, DF1.0, etc.) mainly deal with forgery on human faces, which is an important and meaningful deepfake scenario. However in this paper, most conclusions are made on the LSUN bedroom dataset. The only face-relevant result (FFHQ) is presented in supplementary materials, but from Figure 18(e) we can observe a totally different pattern that contradicts the authors ' conclusion on high-frequency. Unique patterns of FFHQ can also be seen in Figure 16-17. I therefore suggest that the human face deepfake generated by DM should be discussed separately, and its uniqueness should be explained.\n\n4. Since the training and inference of diffusion models are highly related to noise, the effect of perturbations widely used in deepfake datasets (Gaussian noise, blurring, compression, etc.) on DM deepfake detection might also be interesting to look at.\n\n\nReference\n\n[1] Luo, Yuchen, et al. \"Generalizing face forgery detection with high-frequency features.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2021.",
