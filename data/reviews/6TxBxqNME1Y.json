The paper conducts careful experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1.

ProtDiff is for protein generation in 3D, which is similar to previous EDM model for molecule generation. SMCDiff is a new proposed conditional sampling method. Experiments are well designed and sound, showing the model can generate reasonable and realistic structures.\n\nQuestions:\n1. I think from the description of SMCDiff sampling, it is a general sampling algorithm that is not only for proteins. Then, whether you can also show the effectiveness of SMCDiff sampling for general data? I understand running experiments for large-scale images costs too much time, but maybe you can test it on some synthetic data?\n2. Besides, since this is a conditional generation task, I'm a little confused why you only define the problem as an \"inpainting\" problem instead of a conditional generation problem. In other words, for this conditional generation task, you actually don't need to learn the joint distribution and just do conditional sampling. Maybe I misunderstand the available dataset or your tackled scenario, but in my mind in the learning procedure, you can also just learn a conditional model, which may make more sense.\n3.

This paper proposes an interesting technique for generating scaffolds conditional on motifs. First, a 3D diffusion model of protein structures is fit. Then, conditional 'inpainting' is performed to sample the 3D configuration of the scaffold given the motif using a particle filtering technique. Then, an fixed structure -> sequence model from prior work is used to produce a protein sequence. Given the accuracy of AlphaFold, the overall system can be evaluated without performing prohibitively expensive wet-lab experiments: simply check whether the AlphaFold-predicted structure of the output sequence contains the desired motif.

However, I worry that that target audience won't read this paper because it is quite focused on proteins. If the paper was more methods oriented 'hey, we have a generic SMC method for diffusion models\u2026\", it could perhaps have higher impact.\n\nThe experiments are careful and well-thought out, but mostly focus on a couple of small-scale case studies. I don't quite understand why the analysis of the conditional sampling (aka motif scaffolding) couldn't be done at a larger scale (see below). This will hurt the impact of this paper.\n",

I also appreciate that it is frank about the shortcomings of the current experiments, etc. \n\nThe paper brings together disparate ML ideas (diffusion models, sequential Monte Carlo, protein design) in an elegant way. \n\nImplementation for the paper's method is non-trivial (e.g., SMC is annoying to implement).

However, there are clear concerns around the experiments, as they mostly focus on a couple of specific case studies and there are clear shortcomings of the current method (e.g. ability to capture chirality). Below are some questions mostly to clarify why more comprehensive experiments would be challenging.\n\n=Scale of experiments=\nI don't fully understand why sec 5.2 is only on a couple of example proteins. What is the limiting factor? Is it that we don't know good motifs to scaffold? That other natural targets for scaffolding have protein sequences that are too long? Were you compute bound? \n\n=Length of proteins=\nI understand that scalability was a key concern, and thus you trained on sequences of length < 128. Was this a computational or modeling issue? Do you have to actually model every single amino acid in order to capture the gist of the 3d structure? I wonder if the diffusion model could be defined over a coarser-grained version of the structure.\n\n=Types of motifs=\nFig 2a doesn't seem that challenging of a motif. Is it just a single helix? Is the motif consecutive in the primary sequence? For enzymes, for example, I'd imagine that the motif (the active site) would correspond to non-consecutive residues.\n\n=Reliance on ProteinMPNN=\nSurely there are realizable structures that ProteinMPNN can't produce a sequence for. It would be good to know if this is a bottleneck in your system. Do you know what the self-consistency rate of ProteinMPNN is in general? What fraction of PDB structures are such that structure -> sequence -> predicted_structure has high similarity between structure and predicted_structure?\n\n=Minor comments=\nIt would be helpful in the intro to provide a bit more rationale for why prior work only considered 20 residues. It was hard for me to understand why the current work doesn't scale.\n\n\"A protein\u2019s structure is a function of its sequence, so we may write x(s).\" You should acknowledge at some point in the paper that the notion of a single static structure for a sequence is fraught.\n\nI appreciate the negative result at the bottom of page 7!\n",

Particularly, the conditional sampling is implemented as a particle filtering algorithm, where scaffolds that are more consistent with the motif are prioritized. Authors demonstrate that the proposed method generated valid scaffolds for the given motif, as verified by AlphaFold2\u2019s predicted structures. Experiments on unconditional sampling indicate that this model captures the underlying distribution of protein backbones.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n1. The formulation of motif-scaffolding problem as a conditional sampling process is novel, and authors propose a single diffusion model that can be used for both unconditional and conditional sampling to realize such motif-based scaffold design.\n2. The re-weighting scheme in the particle filtering algorithm is based on the likelihood assessment of the diffusion model, which can better guide the conditional sampling process towards the promising direction.\n3. Clear discussion on the modeling and data limitation of the proposed method.\n\nCons:\n1. During the training of ProtDiff, the diffusion model of protein backbones, 3D coordinates are represented in nanometers, rather than Angstrom, so that the spatial scale is similar to an isotropic Gaussian with unit variance. I am not sure whether such scaling is sufficient to ensure that x^{T} at the last step is indistinguishable with an isotropic Gaussian, which is one of the fundamental assumptions in DDPM.\n2. In Section 4.2, authors state that the proposed SMCDiff can provide arbitrary accuracy for conditional sampling, as guaranteed by Proposition 4.1. However, such proposition is based on the assumption that p_theta **exactly** matches the forward diffusion process, which might be too strong and even unrealistic.\n3. In Section 5.1, authors mention that when prediction protein structure with AF2, no multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is used. However, as shown in several single-sequence PLM-based protein structure prediction papers, AF2 w/o MSA input works inferior to such PLM-based structure prediction, possible due to the gap between training and inference inputs. Authors may need to consider feed MSA into AF2 for more reliable predictions, or directly use PLM-based methods (e.g., ESM-Fold, OmegaFold and HelixFold-Single) for in silico evaluation.\n4. In Section 6, authors state that only using 3D backbone coordinates as inputs to ProtDiff is the main cause that ProtDiff is reflection symmetric and may generate left-handed helices. However, I think the EGCL-based network architecture may also be one of root causes (even the biggest one), since EGCL only takes pairwise distance as spatial information, which is reflection invariant. In other words, ProtDiff cannot distinguish one structure and its mirrored counterpart by design, and this won\u2019t be resolved even full-atom 3D coordinates are taken as inputs.",
