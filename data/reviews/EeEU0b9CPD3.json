            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper approaches the problem of learning fluid dynamics with a neural network. To do this, the paper proposes combining a NeRF with the dynamics network to do joint training. The fluid is represented on a grid (the Eulerian way) as volume and velocity. First, the fluid is advected and gravity applied via the standard fluid equations. Next, the fluid is fed into a 3D ConvNet to compute the pressure projection. Finally, the scene is rendered with a NeRF, which takes the volume of fluid at a given location as an additional input. The results show that the joint system is able to accurately model fluid dynamics and render realistic images of the fluid.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The biggest strength of this paper is that the proposed methodology is able to learn fluid dynamics from videos alone! Recent work has shown how this can be done for static scenes and even small amounts of movement, but fluids are high dimensional and have quite complicated dynamics. It is remarkable that this is able to be done, and done well according to the results, from only video data. What this paper is missing is a video attachment, which I suspect would get the results across much better than the static images. An additional strength of this paper is both the analysis of the pressure ConvNet in isolation of the NeRF (by using the GT fluid state, which is available because this is all in sim), and the comparison to T-NeRF and D-NeRF.\n\nThe paper does have a few areas for improvement, however. First of all, the separation of responsibilities between the advection method used and the learned pressure projection is unclear. This makes it hard to assess what the network is learning. Is it a hard task? Or is the advection algorithm doing most of the heavy lifting? This can be fixed by 1) putting a summary of the advection algorithm in the methodology section, and 2) putting a detailed mathematical description of the algorithm in the appendix. Second, the apparent train/test data is fairly simplistic. Most of it appears to be fluid in a cube enclosure, with the main variation being the starting configuration. Note the \u201capparent.\u201d The figures in the paper show only these settings. If there are more complex settings, it is not obvious. This can be fixed by either featuring already existing complex settings in figures, or by adding such settings to the datasets. Finally, the biggest baselines to the proposed methodology are buried in the appendix (A.4). These are the main alternatives to what the paper proposes, their comparisons should be featured prominently in the results section (if space is an issue, the details of the comparison can remain in the appendix).\n\nAlso, one additional comment: The data used in this paper is all sim data. Given that the methodology only requires video, why not try it on a real world dataset? I think those results would be very interesting.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "While there exist some other papers that propose solutions to similar problems, the solution proposed by this paper is quite novel. However, this paper has some major clarity issues.\n\nFirst of all, there are significant grammatical errors in the paper. For example, section 4.1 sentence 5 reads \u201cWe generate two versions datasets\u2026\u201d Section 4.2 sentence 5 reads in part \u201c...to unseen data \u2026 due to that our method does learn fluid dynamics\u2026\u201d A thorough proofreading pass will be necessary before publication.\n\nSecond, it would be difficult to reproduce this paper because the methodology isn\u2019t explained in enough detail. For example, the advection process only cites another paper, but doesn\u2019t say how this paper implements it. Furthermore, section 3.3 says that the volume field is advected based on the velocity field, but doesn\u2019t describe how that is done. Given that section 3.1 paragraph 3 makes it sound as if the use of a volume field is unique to this paper, knowing how it is updated is critical to reproducibility. \n\nFinally, the figures in the paper are difficult to understand. For example, Figure 1 doesn\u2019t make sense. There are 2 advection boxes on the volume field path and 1 on the velocity field path. Are they doing the same thing? Presumably not, but that\u2019s not clear. Also, the velocity field is an input to the advection box between V_t and V_{t+1}, but not an input to the advection box between V_{t-1} and V_t? Also, the gradient flow seems to show the gradients going straight from the NeRF to the pressure ConvNet when they actually pass back through the advection step. Furthermore, Figures 2, 3 (left), and 9 have alternating rows GT and Ours. Presumably each pair of rows are just more examples, but the way they\u2019re presented makes the reader think they are different methods being compared. It would make the figures more clear if the GT-Ours comparison rows could somehow be grouped, e.g., put a line between rows that aren\u2019t the same scene.\n",

It is unclear how the generalization and test-time inference is done. In evaluation, it is emphasized that the proposed method is trained on training set only and directly used on test set, while other methods need test-time optimization. But I don't see an inference module in the architecture. It seems like the approach needs a conditional NeRF and two volumes for velocity/occupancy. How are these components inferred given a test-time video without any optimization?\n- How is the joint training done? Does it train on separate frames, or train on the last frame only?\n- How is the pre-training for NeRF done? It seems that the NeRF needs volume as input, and if it is trained on first several frames, then how can it be trained \"without any groundtruth fluid dynamics\"?\n- How to generate the velocity field for training and testing? Since it is claimed that the model is trained without dynamics, I assume it is randomly initialized at the very beginning of training/testing each scene instance, and it gets evolved across time?\n- Since the proposed model already has an explicit representation of the fluid, why does it need a NeRF for rendering instead of directly rendering the volume? Is resolution the main concern?\n- It is slightly confusing that in Figure 3 the GT frames have a different color for BG/FG compared to the results (also this happens for later figures), while the PSNR in Table 2 looks high. Is it an issue with visualization in figures?\n- Please use \\citep{} for references.",

The volume in the simulator is fed as an additional input to the volumetric renderer, enabling supervising dynamics with videos directly.

It provides the framework with the ability to generalize across different scenes. This approach is effective and will inspire future work.\n- Learning fluid dynamics will be of practical relevance.\n- I like the explanation of the Lagrangian v.s. Eulerian representation. The baseline comparison is convincing. Eulerian representation is easier for implementing a fluid simulator and is very natural to combine with NERF.\n\nWeakness\n\n- It seems that the method requires an initial volume field for pretraining the NERF so that it can start the simulator. Will this limit the application in the real world? After all, obtaining ground truth volume in the real world is very hard. Can the volume be estimated through NERF directly?\n- Though Eulerian representation simplifies the fluid simulator, it's a costly representation compared with particles (for training), and one has to predefine the volume's resolution and size. What if we combine the Langrangian and Eulerian views as in MPM?\n- The lack of real-world experiments kind of weakens the experiment.
