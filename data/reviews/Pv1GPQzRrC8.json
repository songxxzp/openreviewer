            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to use diffusion models to imitate human behaviors. To make text-to-image model suitable for observation-to-action prediction, the authors introduce several modifications, including designing different architectures (MLP with embedding + skip connection, and  Transformer-based), removing Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), and developing reliable sampling schemes. Experiments of task execution in a kitchen environment and playing CSGO show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n----\n_After rebuttal_: The authors have moderately answered the questions and provided additional experiments. Besides, it seems that no critical issues were raised by other reviewers. Given the above, the reviewer would keep the original score (8).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "###### Pros\n- This paper provides (as far as the reviewer knows) one of the first detailed and substantially improved research on applying diffusion models to imitation human demonstrations.\n- The toy experiments and discussions with the arcade claw game (with the figures) provide clear comparisons and convincing motivations.\n- The proposed modifications to standard diffusion models are reasonable and shown to be suitable for sequential environments.\n- The experiments of the kitchen environment with complex joint action space are convincing.\n\n###### Cons\n- The authors compared several methods (i.e., MLP, MLP Sieve, and Transformer), but these are more like ablated models. To demonstrate the superiority of diffusion models for observation-to-action modeling, comparisons to other generative models like GAN and flow models are helpful. Other state-of-the-art methods, like parrot [1] using realNVP for imitation, could also be considered.\n- CSGO experiment is catchy but less convincing than the rest. The results for \"16 x timesteps\" and \"32 x timesteps\" metrics indicate all compared methods are far from satisfactory. More analyses and more baselines should be given for Table 3.\n- Metrics like training time, evaluation time, or GPU consumption during training could better demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n- Does CFG not work due to the lack of data? Compared to text-to-image tasks with massive data, the observation-to-action task only has 566 trajectories with 25 task sequences. The conditions and reasons for CFG not working should be discussed rather than simply declaring that CFG is unsuitable for these tasks.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- This paper is well written.\n- Using diffusion models for imitation learning is new, and the proposed method is shown to be effective.\n- Open-source code is promised.\n\n\n###### Minor questions\n- In Alg. 3, are some lines of $x_0$ missing?\n- Diffusion-X is shown to be effective. It would be great to know the intuition behind its design.\n- Does the \"observation history\" mentioned in this paper contain \"o, t, a\" or only the \"o\"?\n\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes to use diffusion models to model human behavior imitation policies learned with behavior cloning. The motivation is that human behaviors can be complex and multi-modal, and simple Gaussian or categorical policies are unable to capture the underlying multi-modal distributions. The paper utilizes DDPM as the diffusion process and proposes simple architectures to denoise the action distribution. A stable sampling scheme is also proposed to avoid bad actions. Experiments are performed on robot control tasks and first-person shooting games, which demonstrate that the method outperforms the baseline action distribution models across various metrics and achieves better coverage of demonstrations. The paper also discussed and showed through experiments that classifier-free guidance is not suitable for modeling the policy, since it may blend in actions from unrelated states.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:**\n\n- The motivation for using diffusion models for imitation learning is illustrated well with the toy task, where the limitation of standard action models is clear.\n- The proposed sampling methods are effective in improving task completion. The paper also shows that classifier-free guidance is harmful to policy modeling, both through experiments and didactic examples.\n- Experiments are performed on semi-realistic environments such as simulated robotic control and photorealistic video games, which clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Metrics are also comprehensive, evaluating both the quality and coverage of the produced actions.\n\n**Weakness:**\n\n- The paper listed the network architecture as the first contribution, but it\u2019s similar to prior work on diffusion models in essence and appears incremental.\n- It would be great to visualize the learned diffusion policies and demonstrate different modes of action produced by the policy (for robotic control and CSGO), which seems to be the main purpose of using diffusion models.\n- Some notations are confusing, especially the use of $t$ since it normally denotes the RL timesteps. I would recommend using another symbol for the diffusion process.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Besides some notation issues, the paper is mostly well-written and easy to follow.\n- The paper has good conceptual novelty as it proposes to model the policy with diffusion models to capture multi-modal behaviors. The technical novelty is not huge for the network architecture.\n- The authors promise to open source the code, which should make reproducing the work relatively easy.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I appreciate the idea of using diffusion models for imitation learning since they can capture multi-modal behaviors better. The technical novelty is not huge, but the experiments are extensive and the method can serve as a good baseline for diffusion-based imitation learning. I\u2019m leaning toward acceptance at this point.",

The experiments are technically sound and employing diffusion models for imitations learning shows promising results. ",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is very well-written and easy to follow. The paper introduces and adapts diffusion models to behavioral cloning for a range of simulated environments. Employing diffusion models for observation-to-action imitation learning along with the proposed adaptations can be considered novel. Enough details are provided to reproduce the discussed method. \n\nDetailed comments: \n- It is not clear what is shown in Figure 3. What do the columns represent?\n- In the Second paragraph in Section 3.4 the text refers to 'human demonstrations'. As stated above, it is not clear what these are and how they were captured. A discussion about the details of the used datasets would be helpful. \n- In Figure 4 examples of 'Diffusion-X' and 'Diffusion-KDE' are shown. The text referring to the figure in Section 3.4 also discusses 'Diffusion BC'. I would appreciate a visualization of 'Diffusion BC'.\n- For the robotic control and counter strike experiments it would beneficial to more carefully report the inference time of the diffusion model. Section 4.2. mentions that a 'run rate of around 10Hz' was measured, however, a more detailed analysis would provide additional insights, also for future methods that may want to compare to the proposed approach. This is supposed to be in addition to the task runtime provided in Table 5. \n- What exactly is shown in the right plots in Figure 7? What is a certain point in the rollout?\n- It is not clear what is discussed in Appendix Section E. More details should be provided for this section. \n",

The paper is very well written, the experiments are sound, and the problem the proposed method addressees is important. Using diffusion models for behavioral cloning is an interesting and new direction and the paper also has the potential to stimulate future work in this direction. \n\nHowever, there is also a number of shortcomings that I would like to see addressed prior to acceptance. For one, I am missing a comparison to other generative approaches as baselines. I was somewhat surprised that no other learning-based approach was used as a baseline for the arcade claw game experiment. What is the reason for that? Second, for the claw experiment the paper fails to provide a discussion on how human demonstrations where captured and what exactly the action space is. The appendix states that samples were drawn from the true p(a|o). So here no human demonstrations where used at all? \n\nGiven the paper only discusses environments with rather constraint action spaces, I find that the title 'Imitating Human Behaviour' is quite misleading and should be changed (e.g. to 'Imitating Human Demonstrations'). That the method is able to imitate human behavior arguably is a too strong statement that should be toned down throughout the paper (e.g. in Section 5). \n",
