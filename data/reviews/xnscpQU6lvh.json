            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper first identifies problems of SyncMap in Continual General Chunking Problem (CGCP) with long-term instability and poor performances given the asymmetric number of updates of nodes. To solve these issues, a variant of SyncMap, Symmetrical SyncMap is proposed using a symmetric selection of nodes, and a generalized memory window to avoid suffering from the uneven updates from positive/negative feedback loops, and helps the system have more updates from the positive feedback loop, respectively. The authors also show comparisons in 12 imbalanced CGCPs with various difficulties, indicating the proposed method surpasses or ties with other unsupervised SOTA baselines. The authors also verify the performance in real-world scenarios.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n\n- The paper is clearly written and well organized, the formulation of the problem is good, figures and descriptions help in understanding CGCP and SyncMap.\n- The idea of introducing even node updating is intuitive and interesting (also effective in results).\n- Competitive performance to SOTA methods, especially to vanilla SyncMap, and the results are even 1 in most cases.\n- Real-world scenarios evaluation helps understanding of the method, settings and formulations are clear.\n\nCons:\n\n- CGCP is a newly formulated problem, while few comparison methods are evaluated on this issue. Though this paper has listed some conventional and SOTA methods, there is still some space for comparison.\n- The author mentioned, \u201cAs opposed to the original SyncMap that suffers from the uneven updates \u2026\u201d in the Intro, and \u201cthe dynamic\u2019s update is more influenced by negative feedback loop,\u201d in Limitations of SyncMap. Though the motivation is intuitive that unbalanced negative samples may bring extra catastrophic information to the training phase, there do exist situations when there are more positive samples, and in that way, maybe even sampling strategy is no good as uneven does.\n- This novel method is composed of two parts compared to the vanilla SyncMap: symmetrical activation and memory window. I\u2019m concerned that if the authors have evaluated the effect of each of these two components, i.e., does one of the components bring a big boost, or is it the combination of these two that helps much? The integration of both demands further explanation. \n\nMinor:\n\n- Extra \u201c)\u201d in Training Dynamic, page 4.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an improvement over the sync-map algorithm for imbalanced continual general chunking problems (CGCPs). The problem is effectively clustering on sequential data. The original sync-map samples positive pairs and negative nodes (any number), pull together positive pairs, and push apart negative nodes. The improvement is to only sample the same number of negative nodes. In addition, in order to find these negative pairs, the authors propose stochastic selection and memory window.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods over previous methods like Modularity Max, MRIL, and Word2vec.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The proposed method is well inspired by brain activity. It identifies the limitation of the previous syncmap algorithm and improves the algorithm with better sampling. It also proposes sampling tricks such as memory windows.\n2. The empirical advantage of the proposed method is strong. It outperforms previous methods.\n3. The balancing trick and memory window idea can be useful for other domains, e.g., contrastive learning. Hence, this paper may have an impact to out-of-domain topics.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. All the experiments are conducted in a relatively small scale, including both model size and data size. It is questionable how fast this algorithm can converge. As a non-deep-learning algorithm, it is recommended to discuss convergence speed and overall computation/memory complexity. \n2. In addition, the discussion over 'Symmetrical SyncMap depicts the global graph structure while preserving the topology of local communities' seems not well supported. This further limits the scope that the proposed algorithm can apply to.",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength \n\nThe paper studies an interesting problem and its proposed method seems to be working well in multiple synthetic and real-world settings. \n\nWeakness\n\nThe technical contribution seems incremental. It turns a hard-code value of SyncMao into a hyperparameter and forces the positive set and negative set to be equally large. Both seem very minor tweak on the original SyncMap method. \n\nMoreover, they use a stochastic way to match the size of positive and negative sets, which introduces extra noise. I am concerned with it since the goal of this work is to make the original SyncMap method more stable. Although the experiments have shown that their method is better than original SyncMap, I would still like to see a more in-depth stability analysis that discusses why introducing this new noise is not an issue. \n\nThe technical definitions for fixed chunks and prob chunks are a little strange to me. It seems that all chunks are probabilistic but some of them have no branching structures inside them so the internal transition probability is always 1. \n\nI am also concerned with their evaluation. \nFrom my understanding of this problem setting, I think stochastic block model seems a natural baseline method. Actually, the authors used SBMs to synthesize some of their experiments. Then why not use SBM to learn this community structure? \n\nAnother reasonable baseline is to learn a markov model whose transition probability matrix is strongly regularized: it is sparse; it forms local high-prob structure. Why don't the authors consider baseline methods of this style? \n\nWriting needs improvements. \n\nThe technical part of the paper is not very self-contained. E.g., it is not clear how the positive set and negative set (or even eqn-2,3,4 in general) are related to the later stage of clustering. The clustering phase is introduced by simply citing DBSCAN without specifying how it works in this particular technical setting. \n\nThere are typos and errors. E.g., \"positive (7) nodes and negative (2) nodes\" is not consistent with the figure. \n\n",
