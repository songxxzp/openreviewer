            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a framework to learn Riemannian manifold representation using harmonic message passing. To this end, the authors (1) pre-process molecules (or macromolecules like proteins) as a surface function using triangulation, (2) decompose the surface function into components with LB eigenfunctions and coefficients, and (3) perform spectral message passing between the component-wise features. Importantly, the proposed harmonic message passing is motivated by the interpretation of heat diffusion as a message passing between surface regions (LB eigenfunctions and coefficient) with different temperatures (eigenvalues). The proposed methodology is applied for molecular property prediction, binding site prediction, and rigid docking simulation. The empirical results are promising and competitive with respect to the recently proposed molecular representation learning algorithms. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength. \n\nThis paper proposes a novel molecular representation learning framework inspired by molecular surface representation and harmonic analysis. To my knowledge, various geometric deep learning works have focused on message passing between mesh vertices rather than the surface regions (LB eigenfunctions). If my knowledge is correct, I believe this work to be quite significant. \n\nI also appreciate how the experiments are done on both molecules & proteins with various tasks (molecular property prediction, binding site prediction, rigid docking simulation). This makes the empirical benefit of the proposed method convincing.\n\nThe proposed method looks quite scalable, so I think this method might be potentially useful in large-scale scenario where computation time is important.\n\nWeakness. \n\nIn the experiments, it is not clear whether if the complexity of preprocessing molecular surface is considered. I find this confusing since the EquiDock authors mentioned how they avoided molecular surface preprocessing due to high complexity. \n\nThe experimental results for molecular property prediction is not exactly state-of-the-art, but I think this is fine given novelty of the work. Nevertheless, I suggest comparing with more recent works like \"Geometric and physical quantities improve e(3) equivariant message passing, ICLR 2022\" for molecular property prediction (QM9) for completeness of the paper.\n\nI think clarity the description of harmonic message passing could be improved. For example, the input and the output of harmonic message passing is expressed as a function. However, to my understanding, the features being actually updated correspond to different coefficients for the LB eigenfunctions. I think the matrix representation of the function operator (Fig 3) should be described in the text. Also, the symbols in Fig 3 has no corresponding explanation, e.g., what is $\\Phi$? \n\nThe authors claim this method to be scalable to large scale molecules and proteins. However, although the logic is convincing, the authors do not design any experiements to support this fact. When HMP is compared to Equidock in term of preprocessing + inference time, is it faster?\n\n(minor) I find that the experimental setting differs from Equidock. Could you explain the reasoning behind this?\n\n\n",

However, empirical evaluation is could be improved to enough to support this fact. \n\nNovelty: I am aware of existing works on spectral graph convolution between point cloud, graph, and mesh representation of molecules/proteins. However, The idea of harmonic message passing between LB eigenfunctions is very new to me. If this is truly novel, I believe the novelty of this work is very strong.\n",

It is well-known that molecular surface representation captures very different information compared with GNNs. The HMR also uses surface geometry features and chemical features which are not present in the GNN baselines. It is not surprising that HMR can outperform the GNN based EquiDock baseline due to the additional information. I think comparing it with another protein-surface representation baseline like MaSIF [Gainza et al., Nature Methods 17.2 (2020): 184-192.] or Multi-Scale Protein Representation [Somnath et al., NeurIPS 2021] is needed to demonstrate the usefulness of this new molecular surface representation approach.\n- In Table 2, the runtime of the HMR approach is not reported. The key advantage of EquiDock is its significantly faster inference compared conventional docking software. The surface construction might be slow for the HMR method. How does the inference time compare with EquiDock, Attract, and Hdock?\n",

Although the authors claim that \u201cmolecular surface displays chemical and geometric patterns which fingerprint a protein\u2019s mode of interactions with other biomolecules\u201d, some analysis or empirical results are needed to justify the claim and make the proposed surface representation more convincing. Moreover, I agree that the surface may be important for binding problems to some degree, but the claim \u201cthis possibly explains the success of predicting these properties using only molecular surface information, since the surface is approximately an isosurface of the molecular electron density field\u201d is not convincing enough and may need additional justifications.\n\n(-) Current experimental results are not convincing enough to show the significance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
