            "summary_of_the_paper": "The presented paper aims to introduce a method for the robust sim-to-real transfer to address the domain gap between synthetically generated data and real data. The goal of the method is to support training a model with synthetic data so as to generalize to real data. The proposed method -- called 3DNEL -- uses neural embeddings to predict 2D-3D correspondences from RGB and depth images. 3DNEL is used as part of a multi-stage inverse graphics pipeline that is tested on a 6D pose prediction task.  \n",

Several aspects of the method need to be described more clearly. To provide a few examples: \n\n- What is meant by latent 3D scene? \n- Section 3.2 refers to embeddings Q^t, while ' the key model an input 3D model coordinate into an embedding'. What is the difference between these embeddings? As is this is not clear. \n- In Section 3.3. what is meant by 'the learned neural embedding share used to define a likelihood that computes the probability of an RGB-D image given a hypothesized latent 3D scene'? Why hypothesized latent 3D scene?\n- The motivation Section 3.3 is difficult to follow and should be described more clearly. Why are the semantic segmentation maps observed? How exactly is the object coordinate array defined?\n- How exactly is the 'latent point cloud generated'? Why is it latent?\n- What is meant by 'additionally have a uniform distribution on the bounded region as an outlier component'? What is meant by 'outlier component'?\n- Why is the 'normalization constant' well defined? Why is there a finite number of RGB images? \n- Table 1: Why are the results only reported for 5 runs? Wouldn't it make sense to validate on a larger number?\n- Figure 4: What is the arrow on the x-axis supposed to indicate? \n- I would suggest to provide runtime/inference runtime performance measures. This would especially be interesting for the MCMC + ICP experiment discussed in Section 5.3. \n\nAs is, not enough information is provided to allow for reproducing the proposed method. ",

However, it its current form I cannot recommend accepting this work.

The method section needs to be rewritten carefully and more details need to be provided. \n- While the method seems to be sound for the setup defined in the paper, it is not clear how it could be used for other tasks or setups. \n- Compared to SurfEMB the technical contribution appears somewhat marginal.",

The method is purely trained on synthetic images and evaluated on real data showing significant improvements to the baseline method by evaluating multiple hypothesis and refining them using MCMC.",

An ablation for the impact of the different methods Voting, ICP and Random Walk would help to evaluate their impact on the final result.\n\nIt seems that at the moment the proposed method leverages the knowledge of how many objects are present in the scene to create the initial proposals, which is a hugh advantage over other methods that do not have this assumption. While it seems like the assumption could be relaxed, it is unclear if the method remains stable in this case.\n\nIn 3.3 the authors write \"ICP proposals iterate over all objects and use ICP to align each object\u2019s 3D model to the observed 3D point cloud with the point cloud from all the other objects masked out,\", however it is unclear how they can mask out all other objects if they only have semantic masks and not instance masks. While using synthetic data learning instance masks would probably not pose a larger problem than predicting SufEmbeddings, it is unclear how these masks are generated at the moment.\n\n\nCorrections:\nIn 3.1 the dimensions of Q should probably be HxWxE instead of HxWx3",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The joined probabilistic formulation for RGB and depth is novel and interesting.\nWhile the basis is a mix of 3dp3 and SurfEMB, bringing them together is a novel idea and the proposal generation seems also different to existing ideas.",
