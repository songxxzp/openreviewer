Though the author conducted the extensive experiment but that does not exactly prove the same thing. \n\nFrankly, I do agree in some cases, the subgraph would definitely preserve the information of original graph like in figure 2 of the paper. But for most of the cases, subgraph would be very different than the original graph. Thus it is very hard to do the matching/alignment. And make it difficult to evaluate this paper. Overall, I do not think this result is valid given the empirical observation.

One relevant and nice idea is not to consider not only full graph alignment, but also subgraph alignments even in the non-isomorphic case. The authors show that the notion of functional map correspondance can be translated to graphs as looking at mixed eigenmaps connecting eigenvectors of the two considered domains (graphs). Then some empirical results follow. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\n1- as mentioned above, the idea of using map correspondence is nice, and some insghts gained on the alignment between a graph and subgraphs (even non-isomorphic ones) are interesting. This does not appear to have be commented much.\n\n2- the conceptual simplicity of the proposed method is interesting, meaning that the writing of eq. (4) appears almost like a method in itself.\n\nWeaknesses :\n\n1- The writing of the article is wrong for me : i) All the discussions in sections 1 and 2 are, for me, off for a scientific article. Some constatations in 1 are forced without actual any fact to support that (e.g. \"has been largely overlooked\" ; \"common misconception\" ? it could be mere lack of interest due to more relevant things to do) ; Section 2 is way too long to discusse node-to-node correspondence and functional correspondence while there is only scarce comparisons to these state-of-the-art methods in the text (only in Table 1, which is not that conclusive, see underneath)\n\n2- On the other side: the interesting parts of the paper are mostlty in the Appendices.: A.1, A.3, A.4, most of B. This is disturbing to read comments in the main text that are not always useful (details in Section 2), founded (in 1), or with enough details to understand (all of Section 4 where there is no equation describing the proposed method). In the current state of presentation, I don't think this article is suited to the audience of the conference (interested in understading the proposed method and not only in looking at results and discussions).      \n\n3- the mentioned insight about alignment between a graph and subgraphs is not that surprising for people working witgh Graph Laplacians. Hence, the presentation of the results related to that should be dowtoned a bit.\n\n4- the results in 5.3, about node-to-node correspondence, are somehow disappointing (especially w.r.t. the high hopes and stakes puty forward by the authors in Sec 1 to 4): on the task, REGAL performs way better; the proposed method is significantly further away from Ground Truth. \n\n5- I didn't find any point of  comparisons for results in 5.1 and 5.2. No SOTA to compare to ?\n\n\n",

The paper provides convincing empirical evidence that a correspondence between the functional maps (defined by the eigenvectors) may exist between graphs and their sub-graphs even when the sub-graphs are localized. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. **Related Work** : The comparison with existing works in the literature is critically lacking. There exists a rich literature on domain adaptation and meta learning where the contributions involve learning linear mapping to align data from two domains. \n\n      *a.

While the observation that the eigenvectors of a partial graph and the complete graph may correlate is not trivial, the experiments provide no concrete insight into how and why such correlation may exist. For instance, can you meaningfully quantify the similarity between the subgraph and graph sufficient for the correlation pattern in Fig. 2 to emerge? Are the datasets used in Fig. 6  and Fig. 8 low rank? \n\n3. The paper focuses on learning only linear mappings whereas there seem to be no technical challenges to learn non-linear mappings between the functional maps. \n\n",
