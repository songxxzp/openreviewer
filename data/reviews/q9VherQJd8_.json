            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors present a novel approach for identifying which small molecules will be recognized by different mammalian olfactory receptors. While similar approaches have been presented previously, this study introduces a novel combination of neural network architectures to model the protein-ligand interaction, relying on the learned representation of protein sequences in the ProtBERT language model paired with a graph neural network representation of the small molecule with an attention mechanism to learn non-bonded interactions. They show that this architecture is able to outperform pre-existing techniques at predicting interactions within a newly collected database of 46,450 odorant-OR pairs and dissect how different variations on the network leaving out aspects of the model lead to worse performance at these benchmarks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This work represents an important step toward models that can reliably predict protein-ligand interactions, focused on the very interesting case of odorant receptors and small molecules. The architecture presented is one that is original and sophisticated, and in Section 5.1 the authors make a convincing case that its choices are not arbitrary. While it is not the first paper to use AI to predict olfactory recognition, previous studies have used much simpler models that rely on SMILES encodings of small molecules; I think especially that the attention mechanism learned over the molecular graphs to learn nonbonded interactions strikes me as an important methodological innovation in this study. \n\nThe \u201cGeneralization\u201d section of the manuscript is very important, and the authors perform a number of important statistical tests: notably to not only perform random train/test splits of receptors and molecules but also to cluster them, such that members of the test set are relatively different from the training set. Their models perform quite poorly in these situations, and the authors are honest about this case. I personally find it to be a strength of the paper that they did this test, although it obviously opens the door to future improvements of the model. \n\nThe dataset generated of over 45,000 OR-olfactant pairs is also a strength of this paper and will serve as an invaluable reference for future researchers in the field.\n\nBroadly, I feel that the model is stronger at modeling small molecule space than protein space, especially as the protein sequence representation relies entirely on the pretrained [CLS] tokens of ProtBERT. I would personally recommend trying a few variations on this, although I wouldn\u2019t say that they are required because I understand that they can be computationally intensive and challenging to add into such an already large model; I would recommend this as a direction of future research (which the authors also note!) \n\nI also think that some technical parts of the paper are somewhat unclear and could use slightly more description. For example, several aspects of their architecture are not well explained; the message passing neural networks (Q-MPNN and KV-MPNN) are never mentioned in the main text - are these the \u201ctwo separate identical GNNs for queries and keys/values\u201d mentioned? If, so that should be made clear, along with what the \u201cQ\u201d and \u201cKV\u201d mean. The meaning of \u201cX_old\u201d, \u201cX_new\u201d and \u201cE\u201d in Figure 1 are also not described. I can guess as to their meaning, but it would be better for it to be clearly stated in the legend. Explaining this terminology will also make the \u201cablations\u201d section more clear, although there are also a few architectures introduced first in that section (e.g. GAT) that could be introduced slightly more clearly and justified in their use.\n\nIn Section 6, the precise definition of \u201ccombinatorial code\u201d for each odorant is also somewhat unclear - I am guessing that they mean that they are the predicted recognition of the odorant by each of the 385 human ORs in the model presented earlier, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, while they are very mathematically precise about how their clustering score is defined, I initially didn\u2019t understand what actual data they were analyzing.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The overall quality of the work is generally high: the data set collected is large and the model architecture is sophisticated, showing considerable thought.\n\nThe clarity of the question being asked is good but some of the methodological details are lacking in clarity; see description above.\n\nThe paper approaches a question that has been asked by a range of recent papers, but uses a novel architecture (albeit one that has similarities to architectures used for other similar problems in chemistry); I personally felt that especially the key usage of attention to model non-bonded interactions was quite original. The approach of relating their predictions to olfactory perception - while building on existing models of olfactory perception - was also quite original to the best of my knowledge.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "This paper is overall an impressive piece of work and I think that it would be a valuable addition to ICLR. The architecture used in particular is quite novel and an important increase in sophistication and predictive power over other architectures used in the field, although some elements of its design and testing could be made somewhat more clear in the paper. Especially if these aspects are stated more explicitly in the paper, I would strongly recommend this paper for acceptance.\n",
