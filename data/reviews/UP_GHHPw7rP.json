            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The result is sharp and improves upon the best-known results so far. However, I think the current writing hurt the quality of the paper a lot. Before recommending to accept, I think the following aspects need to be handled properly.\n1. What's the point of Section 4? According to my understanding, it behaves worse than the algorithm introduced later in the next section, and also the algorithmic form looks very standard, if not totally the same as Jin et al. (2021c). Actually, I think the algorithmic idea here has already been covered in that paper. If I have misunderstood anything, please correct me by explicitly adding some discussion on this difference. \n2. Regarding Section 5, it seems to me the main technical contribution is to remove the additional (implicit) assumption in Yin et al. (2022). Am I understanding this correctly? If so I think this is something the authors may want to emphasize earlier in the paper. Actually, it would be very helpful to add a table comparing the result in all the related work in offline RL with linear function approximation.\n3. The authors may also want to highlight some of the technical contributions of this paper, and make a sharp distinction between the existing techniques and the ones you proposed (or improved). For example, I think the advantage decomposition has already been used by Jin et al. (2021c). As a classic technique, the authors may even want to put this into the preliminaries section and only keep the very original part in the remaining sections. This not only helps the readers to place the current paper in the whole literature but also makes it easier to evaluate the value of the paper.",

In such a setting, the controller is given a trace of execution of the MDP with a fixed exploration policies. The controller uses this trace to compute a near-optimal policy. The objective of this paper is to provide an algorithm with provable regret guarantee. The authors study both the classical MDP setting and the two-player zero-sum Markov games.\n\nFor MDP, such an algorithm already exists in the literature but the authors of the current paper argue that their analysis do not hold. The authors therefore propose a new algorithm that fixes the bugs.  This algorithm is the adapted to the two player zero-sum Markov game.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper proposes to correct an existing algorithm for offline MDP.  This seems a valid contribution if the result holds. I must admit, however, that I found the paper very hard to read, with lots of technical details and notations. This might be because I am not that familiar with the previous paper but I also think that it is because the paper wants to present too many results. Hence, it is not really self-contained and the results are barely commented or described.\n\nFor instance, the authors choose to add an extension to two-player zero-sum Markov games. I do not think that this brings new insight nor original ideas compared to the MDP case but that takes an extra 2 pages. As a result, there is no related work in the paper, and no real comment or explanation around the results.\n\nSince this paper is mostly a theoretical paper that aims at correcting a bug in a previous analysis, I think that this analysis should be made clear. In the current version, I cannot be sure that the authors are also overlooking some steps of the proofs.\n",
