            "summary_of_the_paper": "Variational quantum circuits constitute a main class of quantum algorithm on current noisy, intermediate scale quantum devices (NISQ). This paper studies approximating the result of VQCs by classical algorithms. Specifically, for VQCs with Hamiltonian encoding, this paper demonstrates how to use random Fourier features (RFF) to sample a few frequencies, build an equivalent low-dimensional kernel, and then solve by linear ridge regression (LRR) and kernel ridge regression (KRR).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "From my perspective, the topic of simulating quantum computing by classical computing is in general interesting. In particular, considering that quantum computing devices will stay at the status of NISQ for a while, research about whether they can be simulated by classical devices are in general interesting. This submission to ICLR 2023 falls into this category, and it provides both theoretical and experimental results. In addition, the codes are open-source with an anonymous package provided.\n\nNevertheless, after reading through the paper, I have concerns from a few aspects:\n\n1. First and foremost, I\u2019m not sure if this paper provides enough evidence for simulating VQCs on classical computers efficiently in general. In particular, I\u2019m worried about both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, RFF with distinct sampling and RFF with tree sampling. They both diagonalize the Hamiltonians of the VQC\u2019s encoding gates, but I don\u2019t think it is doable in general \u2013 the Hamiltonian matrix scales exponentially with the number of qubits, i.e., a VQC on 50 qubits will in general have Hamiltonians of dimension 2^50 * 2^50. Diagonalization of such matrices is simply intractable on classical computers. In addition, the algorithms run LRR or KRR, but regression can also be slow in general. In all, I feel that the authors should give significantly more explanation about why their proposed algorithms are actually efficient on classical computers. In theory, Theorem 1 in Section 3.4 is a sample complexity result and does not investigate time complexity. In practice, the experiments are only conducted for Hamiltonians with 3 qubits or so. Either more evidence from theory or practice that the proposed algorithms have good time cost will be very helpful.\n\n2. The technical novelty of this work needs to be better explained. On the one hand, this paper follows the paper Schuld (2021) heavily, which had proposed the idea of applying kernel methods to machine learning problems. The authors may want to further explain how this work departs from Schuld (2021). It seems that using random Fourier features is a main consideration different from Schuld (2021), but this goes to my concern on the other hand: it omits very important results on quantum-inspired classical algorithms based on random Fourier features, namely Yamasaki et al. https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/9ddb9dd5d8aee9a76bf217a2a3c54833-Abstract.html at NeurIPS 2020 and Yamasaki and Sonoda https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09028.pdf. These two papers have studied the ideas of using classical sampling-based methods under random features to solving quantum machine learning problems. A very detailed comparison is very necessary from my perspective.\n\n3. Minor suggestions and typos in the paper:\n\n- Introduction:\n- - At many places, the references shall be listed with brackets, for instance in Page 1, Abbas et al. (2021); Cong et al. (2019); Huang et al. (2021) -> (Abbas et al. 2021; Cong et al. 2019; Huang et al. 2021). This should be applied in general for references as descriptions and not being the subject/object in a sentence.\n\n- - There\u2019s a sentence: \u201cWhen it comes to trainability, it has been shown that these exponential spaces are in fact drawbacks McClean et al. (2018)\u201d. This is the famous barren plateau paper. I personally found this a bit inappropriate because the main of having barren plateau is not having exponential-size space, but more like the stochasticity in many ansatzes for parametrized quantum circuits has variance decrease exponentially in the number of qubits. I guess the reasoning here needs to be more careful.\n\n- Page 2, bottom: The other gates are called trainable -> Other gates are trainable.\nfigure 2 -> Figure 2 (and many other similar places)\n\n- Page 3, Eq.11 -> Eq. (11)\n\n- Page 3, A scaled version of Pauli encoding exist, where the Pauli are -> A scaled version of the encoding exists, where the Paulis are\n\n- Page 6: It would be helpful to explain the intuition of Theorem 1, especially how this is proved.\n\n- Page 13: How do we get Eq. (6) and (7), i.e., the eigenvalues have those forms? More discussions about the linear algebra behind will be preferred.\n\n- Page 18: There is a broken link at Appendix F. Also a few other typos: section 3.4 -> Section 3.4, (Eq.5) -> Eq. (5).",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper questions the benefits of variational quantum circuits (VQC) for machine learning by demonstrating simple classical algorithms for approximating them. Specifically, VQC can be thought of as a multidimensional fourier series and so makes it a natural target for approximation via Random Fourier Features (RFF). The paper details three sampling strategies to sample frequencies for constructing random features to approximate a given VQC, as well as providing theoretical bounds on the approximation error. Under some assumptions RFF can efficiently approximate VQC as commonly implemented. The methods are tested on both synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate their effectiveness. The theoretical results also leave open the possibility of how VQC could still be beneficial for machine learning.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* Clearly introducing the main concepts of VQC for ML, as well as RFF, making the paper accessible to a broad audience.\n* Very convincing arguments for the limitations of current VQC approaches, while outlining where future effort should be focused. Quantum advantage is a topic of high interest, and specifically quantum advantage for ML. Any work that helps shed light on when quantum-based approaches can and cannot help is of great significance.\n\nWeaknesses:\n* From a practical perspective, it is difficult to tell (for a non-expert in the field) how representative the experiments are. Could it be that there are factors of scale that are limited due to availability of current quantum accelerators that might change the empirical results -- not unlike the case of neural networks showing their true potential once sufficient data and compute became available? How dependent is the analysis and empirical results on current hardware and the regime tested?\n* The last two experiments are a bit confusing. Are you fitting the RFF to match the training data or to approximate the given VQC? If the former, then what do we learn from these experiments as opposed to any other classical ML technique? If the latter, then how come the test loss is better for RFF when it is trained to match the VQC?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: The paper, method, and results are clearly presented. The only issue is some lack of clarity in the last two experiments, where it is not clear how the RFF are used and what did we learn from them.\n\nQuality: While I am not an expert in quantum accelerators, as far as I can tell the methods and theoretical claims appear to be correct.\n\nNovelty: The paper is very novel, and could have a significant impact on quantum ML approaches.\n\nReproducibility: Code for reproducing the results was provided, though I did not look into it or try to run it. Theoretical results appear to be correct.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Based on the importance of finding when or if quantum accelerators can achieve quantum advantage for ML, I believe this paper should be accepted. The paper clearly lays out the logic and theoretical analysis for attacking the current methods for quantum acceleration of ML, while also pointing the path forward.
