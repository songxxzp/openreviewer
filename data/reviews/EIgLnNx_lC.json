            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper argues that existing doubly robust (DR) estimators usually have a large variance, a large bias, and poor generalization ability given inaccurate error imputation. The paper proposes a novel estimator, called targeted doubly robust (TDR), to simultaneously reduce the bias and variance of existing DR estimators. The paper demonstrates that the imputed errors by the TDR estimator satisfy two important properties called validity and preservation in Theorem 1 and shows that the TDR estimator preserves the desired property of double robustness in Theorem 2. The paper further proposes a semi-parametric collaborative learning approach (TDR-CL) whose key idea is to decompose imputed errors into parametric term and a non-parametric correction term. The paper conducts semi-synthetic experiments to demonstrate that the proposed TDR estimator achieves the lowest absolute relative error among four baseline estimators (Naive, EIB, IPS, and DR) under six rating missing scenarios (ONE, THREE, FIVE, Rotate, SKEW, and CRS). The paper also conducts experiments on two real-world datasets (COAT and YAHOO) and the experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches under MSE, AUC, NDCG@5, and NDCG@10.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "S1: The idea of applying targeted learning techniques to effectively reduce the bias and variance of existing DR estimators is novel. The paper provides theoretical results showing that the imputed errors obtained with the proposed TDR estimator satisfy two desired properties (validity and preservation) and the proposed TDR estimator has the desired property of being doubly robust.\n\nS2: The paper conducts pretty extensive semi-synthetic experiments and real-world experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed TDR estimator and TDR-CL approach, respectively. In the semi-synthetic experiments, the paper simulates a total of six different rating missing scenarios and compares the proposed TDR estimator against four baseline estimators under these diverse scenarios. In the real-world experiments, the paper uses two real-world datasets, compares against a wide range of baseline approaches (IPS, SNIPS, CVIB, DR, DR-JL, etc.), applies the proposed TDR-CL approach to two representative DR approach (DR-JL and MRDR), and computes various evaluation metrics (MSE, AUC, NDCG@5, NDCG@10). The extensive experimental results make the argument that the proposed estimator and approach are more effective than existing approaches much convincing.\n\nW1: In Section PRELIMINARIES, it is not clear why a prediction error is defined as an expectation of the real prediction error given features. It is important to add more explanations and clarifications here.\n\nW2: It would be better if the paper can move the descriptions of the six rating missing scenarios, ONE, THREE, FIVE, Rotate, SKEW, and CRS, from the Appendix to the main text.",

The variance of DR, while being lower than variance of Inverse Propensity Score (IPS), is higher than variance of Error Imputation Based (EIB) method. The objective is to come up with an estimator with the best of the two worlds: DR and EIB.\n\nBy rewriting DR estimator as a sum of the EIB estimator and a correction term, they model the error imputation by any arbitrary function (without any assumptions) so that the correction loss is equal to zero to ensure the lowest variance of EIB but smaller bias than EIB (Theorem 1). \n\nTDR benefits from all other advantages of EIB: boundedness and robustness to small properties. The authors show TDR does not increase the bias compared to DR. Theorem 2 proves its double robustness. \n\nThe authors finally show how TDR is used in a collaborative-filtering-based recommender system. \n",

Definitions of the concepts are recalled in the appendix.\n\nThe theoretical contributions of the paper are significant and are supported by extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets (best performances are obtained by TDR estimator and its variants). \n\nWeaknesses:\n\nThe section on \u201csemi-parametric collaborative learning\u201d might be a little bit dense.\n\nIt might be worth also to recall briefly the differences between the competing methods used for comparison in the Section \u201cReal-World Experiments\u201d.\n\nIt would be finally helpful for the reader to give a little bit more details on targeted learning and the link with the proposed estimator.\n\nWhich stopping criteria and number of steps do you suggest for Algorithm 1 in practice?\n\nMinor (typos):\n-p.4: \u201cSpecifically, It\u201d",

The authors correctly credit van der Laan and Rose for developing TDR estimators, but they do not relate the multi-step algorithm in Sec. 4.1 on TDR with previous work by van der Laan and Rose. Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 in Sec 4.1 appear to be new, but the reader is not explicitly made aware of this fact.\n\n2. The authors ignore temporal variability in recommender systems and assume that features $x_{ui} $ for a user-item pair are static rather than temporally varying.\nRecurrent Recommender Networks, WSDM 2017, shows that this assumption often does not hold for real world recommender systems.\n\n3. The presentation of the material could be improved. For instance, the columns \"Without extrapolation\" and \"Boundedness\" in Table 1 are not explained in the paper and one needs to refer to appendices, whereas the symbol \\eta in eq (4) changes to \\epsilon when we reach Algorithm 1 and its description.
