In particular, they consider the degree-corrected block model (DCBM) where each node belongs to one of K communities and has a degree parameter. Then, the edges are generated between nodes according to the degree parameter of the two nodes and community connection probability.  The problem is given the label of a subset of nodes, to find the label of the remaining nodes. They propose two new algorithms Anglemin and Anglemin+ for this problem. They provide a misclassification error bound for their algorithm and show their algorithm is nearly optimal by comparing it with the information-theoretical lower bound. Finally, their experimental results show their algorithms achieve smaller classification errors than the unsupervised method.",

The problem can be easily solved by existing algorithms with slight modification. For example, we can run the community detection algorithm again on the whole network. If we are only allowed to apply local refinement on the network to reduce computational complexity, the following steps will also work. \n\n(i) Apply prototypical refinement, e.g., Algorithm 2 of Gao et al. (2018), with known labels, then we can assign labels to nodes in $\\mathcal U$.\n\n(ii) Now we have labels for all nodes. we update the labels for every node by applying the same refinement procedure with initial labels for all node. \n\nNote that the reason we update the labels in step (ii) is to use the information in $A_{\\mathcal U\\mathcal U}$. The method in Gao et al. (2018) may not be applied to non-assortative block models, but it is not hard to replace their procedure by a local likelihood ratio classifier. \n\n2. The authors propose a method based on the cosine distance. This classifier may be equivalent to likelihood ratio classifier. If this is the case, it should achieve the information theoretical lower bound, but the authors fail to show this in Lemma 2. It is claimed in the paper that \"we bound the total variation distance by the Hellinger distance (the total variation distance is hard to analyze directly)\". It can be shown that the exponent of total variation distance and Hellinger distance are the same up to a $1+o(1)$ factor. See [1] for details. If the connectivity matrix is more general, you can use Chernoff information to bound the total variation distance. See Section 11 of [2] for more details. \n\n[1] Zhang, Anderson Y., and Harrison H.

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- It is my understanding that when references are not included as part of the sentence, it should be (Ji et al. (2022)) rather than Ji et al. (2022). However, the citation format seems to be mixed throughout the paper, such as in the first paragraph of the introduction. I encourage the authors to fix the misused reference formats.\n\n- In the third paragraph of the introduction, two real-world examples are given to motivate the research question. Maybe add some references to support the first example just like Ji et al. (2022) supports the second example.\n\n- I have major reservations about the experiments on real-world networks.\n\n1) Is it a fair comparison between this model and GCN, when your setting excludes node attributes while GCN specifically focuses on propagating messages based on node attributes? Although three measures are adopted to add synthetic node attributes to do GCN (i: all 1 vectors, ii: random attributes, iii: adjacency vectors), I am not sure whether these are standard practices to use GNNs on networks with no node attributes. Propagating messages with all-1 vectors seems to be resulting in over-smoothing. Using adjacency vectors as node features means that the feature transformation linear layers' size changes with respect to the number of nodes in a network, which is not an inductive setting and could heavily overfit due to too my parameters. If these statements are true, then the consistently low performance of GCNs in Table 1 could be a result of the undesirable experiment setting, not necessarily indicating the proposed approach's superiority over GCN. Setting aside whether it's fair to compare non-attribute approaches with GCN, I would encourage the author to check out standard practices to add synthetic node attributes in GNN research.\n\n2) Since (a) the authors acknowledged that the proposed approach could be extended to handle attributed graphs (remark 4 in Section 2.2), (b) GCNs rely on meaningful node attributes, and (c) an increasing amount of real-world networks have nodes with clear attributes or semantic information, I wonder if it might be better and fairer to evaluate on the datasets used in [1] and/or other large-scale real-world networks [2,3].\n\n3) Let's assume that the current setup, adding synthetic features to GCN as a baseline, is fair. In that way, there seem to be more advanced semi-supervised community detection approaches based on better GNNs and node attributes [1,4,5,6]. The authors are encouraged to compare with them, or at least discuss them in the related work.\n\n- The authors stated that \"we do not think that our work has any potential negative influence\" and I would like to propose one. In the third paragraph of the introduction, the authors gave an application case of how to determine the community belongings of social media users with the help of a small fraction of nodes with known community labels. Similarly, the proposed approach could be manipulated by malicious and authoritarian actors to identify dissenters on social media with \"dissenter\" as a community. If the authors agree, I would suggest expanding the discussion in the ethics statement.\n\n[1] Jin, Di, et al. \"Graph convolutional networks meet markov random fields: Semi-supervised community detection in attribute networks.\" Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence.
