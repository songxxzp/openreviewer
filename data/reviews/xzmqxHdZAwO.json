            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on unsupervised visual anomaly detection in a changeover-based few-shot learning setting. It is a fundamental problem since the changeover scenario requires an anomaly detection model to localize the anomalies in a few samples. Unlike previous meta-learning settings, the authors propose a native few-shot setting, i.e., the training dataset at most contains eight normal samples, to simulate the changeover-based situation. The authors first introduce the data augmentation methods into PatchCore , which can significantly surpass the sota models, like RegAD. Then they unlock the deep insight from Aug+PatchCore and propose a novel model, GraphCore. The motivation of GraphCore is to utilize the rotation-invariant feature representation for each patch and replace ResNet with a GCN model. The authors evaluate their methods on multiple datasets and obtain a high performance of GraphCore in the changeover-based few-shot setting. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n\n+ The authors introduce one simple but effective method, Aug+PatchCore, which is well-suited for real-world challenges and provides valuable insight into the problems. The written logic is evident and easy to follow. I like the writing style of this paper and read it with great interest. \n+ The authors propose an excellent problem setup to address fundamental challenges from a changeover-based setting. Previously, few-shot anomaly detection often adopts meta-learning settings, ignoring fast converagence in industrial manufacturing. Fig.1 is easy to follow. Moreover, the assumptions are reasonable.\n+ The motivation is apparent and reasonable, where they find that the rotation-invariant features primarily increase the anomalies detection abilities. The authors utilize the isometric transformation property of GCN and propose a new feature extraction model, GraphCore. In addition, I believe that the introduction of GCN into anomaly detection for the first time is quite innovative.\n+ The experiments are sufficient to support their conclusions.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\n+ Though the numerical results are convincing, I think the authors had better visualize the normal samples in their training dataset, especially in the few-shot setting. I suppose that the quality of normal samples or features predominantly affects the result in one-shot or two-shot setting. So they need to show us which normal samples for training. \n+  I encourage more data augmentation methods to sufficiently support their insights, not just for rotation augmentation. I think there is a need to explain why GraphCore could enhance the performance of other classes, like grid, bottle and even hazelnut. I suggest more data augmentation methods, e.g., flipping, translation or even scaling, should be conducted to prove the advantages of GraphCore. I think my suggestions could make this paper more substantial.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "This paper is well-written and easy to understand overall. Regarding reproducibility, I think the author should provide source codes and give more visualizations of the training samples in the few-shot setting.

            "summary_of_the_review": "This is a vital paper, and I recommend it for acceptance. It addresses changeover-based few-shot anomaly detection problems in a practical manner. The authors propose a novel GraphCore model to extract visual isometric features. The extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of visual isometric features. However, the paper lacks the visualization of the training samples under one-shot and two-shot settings.  In total,  I would love to see GNN be more adapted to visual anomaly detection method, which boosts merging CV community with GNN community.\n",

In this way, a small number of images can provide sufficient features for anomaly detection, reducing the size of memory bank.\n+ The experiments are extensive. The paper compares the proposed method with a variety of representative methods on multiple datasets in terms with different shot numbers.
