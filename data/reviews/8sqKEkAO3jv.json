The fruitful experimental results prove the advantage of the proposed paradigm.",

The summary and definition are interesting and impressive. Following the modeling rule and interesting analysis, this work demonstrates that introducing the image prior into global modeling will promote the development of customized global modeling image restoration paradigm. \n+ Sufficient experiments and good performance: This paper conducts extensive experiments on many mainstream low-level tasks. The extensive experiments suggest that the proposed paradigm achieves the competitive performance with fewer computational resources. \n+ The paper writing is clear and easy to follow.\n\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n+ The implementation details are confused. For image tasks of image de-hazing/de-raining/enhancement, the proposed paradigm can be directly applied to them as shown in Figure 3. However, in terms of guided image super-resolution with two modalities, the proposed paradigm seems to be modified but the details are not clearly described. \n+ Although the proposed paradigm is verified on several image restoration tasks and achieves good quantitative scores under many IQA metrics, it would be better that the visual results are presented.  The reviewer understands the limited space in the main paper. The visual results could be presented in the supplementary material. \n",

It follows the popular transformer-like backbone but replaces the non-local attention module with Fourier-transform-based operations. The core idea is to leverage the global property of the Fourier space, i.e., manipulating local areas within Fourier space would affect the global spatial data, as a drop-in replacement for the global feature extraction mechanism typically empowered by computation-intensive attention operations. The experiments on multiple image restoration tasks (enhancement, draining, dehazing, pan-sharpening) collectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against the selected methods in terms of restoration quality and computation efficiency. \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "[Pros]\n- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow\n- Extensive experiments on multiple image restoration tasks looks sound\n\n[Cons]\n- The idea of utilizing Fourier transform as a global modeling tool is not new. There are many works that incorporated Fourier transform in the network design but the authors didn't mention (and compare). A closely related competitor is the Fast Fourier Convolution operation proposed in [A], which  explores an efficient ensemble of local and non-local receptive fields in a single unit. This operation is further utilized in image inpainting [B], demonstrating excellent capability to fill large missing areas via global reasoning. Thus, the novelty of the proposed method is quite limited. \n- One of the key insight driving this paper is erroneous. The authors claimed \"Fourier transform is capable of disentangling image degrada-\ntion and content component\", this is unfortunately wrong. The examples shown in Figure.1 is misleading. In fact, the Fourier phase component represents the major \"appearance\" of a image, so swaping the phase component of two images swaps the contents of these two images (You could simply verify this through swaping the phases of two irrelevant images). Consequently, the author's argument \"Fourier transform is capable of disentangling image degradation and content component and the degradation mainly lies in the amplitude component\" is suspicious and not justified. \n- The experimental comparisons against SoTA are not well executed. The authors didn't make \"apple to apple\" comparisons between the proposed Fourier-based operation and other global modeling operations (e.g., various attention modules). SoTA image restoration methods [C,D] that heavily explore global reasoning are also not compared.\n\n[A] Fast Fourier Convolution, NeurIPS 2020  \n[B] Resolution-robust Large Mask Inpainting with Fourier Convolutions, WACV 2022  \n[C] Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration, CVPR 2022  \n[D] MAXIM: Multi-Axis MLP for Image Processing, CVPR 2022  ",
