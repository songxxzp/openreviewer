Based on two weaknesses of HSVA (trains model with local structure and loses some high-dimensional structure information), the authors propose a Topology-guided sampling strategy and a Topology Alignment Module. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. This paper is well-organized and well-written, which is easy to read.\n2. The idea of topology alignment is novel, but it is only reflected in sampling data, where the relations among data are not modeled, which is a bit trivial. \n\nWeakness:\n1. Figure 1 is difficult to understand. What are the lines in figure 1 (a-c) represent? What does \u20180-dim\u2019 represent?\n2. The framework is too completed. It contains 4 autoencoders, which seems an ensemble of the proposed approach and CADA-VAE. There are too many losses in the framework. Is it efficient to learn?\n3. The representations in the formulation are inconsistent.\n(a)Is \u2018x\u2019 in Eq 2 \u2018x_max\u2019?\n(b)Are \u2018Z_v\u2019 in Eq 9 and \u2018z_x\u2019 in Eq 11 the same? \u2018z_x\u2019 is not mentioned in the paper.\n4. All the compared methods are before 2022 and the performance is not good compared with the recent 2022 papers. \n5. The proposed method is an incremental work based on HSVA, why not use the same baseline with HSVA. It is difficult to judge whether the improvement is made by the proposed TAD or an ensemble of CADA-VAE.\n6. No qualitative analysis is made to show why preserving the global structure is good. What does it benefit? Is it good to generate more effective features? However, no feature visualization is conducted.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "1. The framework is clear and some formulations may be inconsistent.\n2. The novelty may lie in the sampling of training examples and using the Persistent Homology to measure the difference between feature space and latent space.\n3. The framework is too complicated, which is an ensemble of 4 autoencoders. Though each part is clear, the training may be difficult.",

Given AE TP and CA are counting, visual-semantic reconstruction, topologic alignment, and distributional alignment, why the effects of the three hyperparameters are so consistent? It usually needs to find a balance between complementary objective functions.
