            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper makes two contributions: First, it presents a large-scale 2D fluid simulation dataset called EAGLE. The dataset consists of 2D scenes with (dynamically changing) rigid boundaries and Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) fluids. Second, it proposes a neural network model (mesh transformer) for solving fluid problems and compares its performance with popular neural network simulators (MeshGraphNet, etc).",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The proposal of a large-scale fluid simulation dataset is very timely. I believe having a high-quality dataset will foster relevant research in the learning community.\n\nOn the other hand, part of me feels this dataset is still premature. It is probably better than many existing fluid simulation datasets in previous papers, but I think it could have been more polished.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "There are quite a few things unclear to me in the simulation dataset:\n- Are there any reasons behind the choice of simulating RANS instead of the original Navier-Stokes equations in the dataset?\n- It looks like the drone and the fluid are one-way coupled instead of two-way coupled: the drone provides boundary conditions to the fluid\u2019s motion, but the fluid does not affect the drone\u2019s motion (there are no velocity or pressure terms in Eqn. 8). If the fluid has no influence on the drone, I feel the MPC control is a bit redundant and a kinematic drone should suffice.\n- I am not sure I get how the drone\u2019s mesh serves as the boundary condition of the fluid area. It looks like its bounding box is used. Could you elaborate on the velocity/pressure boundary conditions around the bounding boxes? I was expecting some inlet/outlet flow velocity to be set at where the propellers are, but I didn\u2019t find details about it.\n- I don\u2019t quite understand the task definition at the end of Sec. 3. Do the node positions x_i change over time? It looks like the fluid area is remeshed at every frame if I am not mistaken.\n\nI initially thought the proposed dataset simulated two-way coupled Navier-Stokes fluids and a dynamic, controllable UAV when reading the main text and was quite excited. It would be good if the paper could clarify the setting upfront in Sec. 3.\n\nRegarding the network model, it looks like the velocity and pressure fields are predicted purely based on the original mesh at the current time followed by resampled to the new mesh if I am not mistaken. This seems questionable to me because I think the correct velocity and pressure field at the next time step will be determined by both the current and new mesh.\n\nReproducibility: I guess this largely depends on what will be included in the released dataset. Replicating the full simulation results using Ansys is probably intractable for people with limited access to computational resources, but I still suggest the dataset include configurations of the scenes in Ansys if possible.\n\nOther comments:\n- Is EAGLE an acronym?\n- The baselines are confusing: the beginning of Sec. 5 refers MeshGraphNet and Cylinder-Flow to Li et al. 2019, but I don\u2019t think that paper means either of them. By MeshGraphNet the paper probably means Pfaff et al. [2021].\n- I appreciate that the paper frankly talked about failure cases and poor results (Scalar flow) in the experiments.\n",

Although different shapes of the boundary affect how the mesh is constructed and how they are clustered, it seems that the model still generalizes well.\n2.

Missing reference: Takahashi, Tetsuya, et al. \"Differentiable fluids with solid coupling for learning and control.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. Vol. 35. No. 7. 2021.\n2. I wonder how this can be applied to 3D cases. Since the 2D task only there is already 270Gb data, it is probably not practical to prepare a good amount of data for the model to converge and generalize. Also, dealing with tetrahedra instead of triangles may introduce unknown challenges. Please add more insights regarding the extension to 3D in the conclusion section.\n3. How does the mesh resolution affect the training/test accuracy? If the training and test images are of different resolutions, will the model perform better or worse? It would be great to see such comparisons in the experiments.\n",

First, the dataset only contains 2D data, whose usefulness is suspicious due to the diffusion of fluid. I wonder if the authors can provide more insights on how they are useful in real engineering.\n- Several previous datasets are working in CFD, e.g., http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/. How is the proposed dataset compared to theirs?\n- The only variation in the dataset is the geometry.
