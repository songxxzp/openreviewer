Given the rich content of the paper, the reviewer believe additional work needs to be done to make the story easier to follow. The reviewer has several suggestions:\n\n1. There are several places in the paper that a term is described first and the definition is given several sections later in the paper, which brings difficulty for the reader to follow.\n2. The reviewer thinks it would be useful to first introduce the intuitions behind the algorithms and then present the algorithm. This is particularly the case for algorithm 2.\n3. In section 4.2, the reviewer feel a little bit lost since the outliers are introduced in the paper. The discussion of outlier removal is not very closely related to the existence of outliers. Given the space limit of the paper, it would be clearer to focus only on one topic and brings other issues in the appendix or the discussion section.\n\nMajor concerns:\n1. The reviewer has several questions in terms of algorithm 2 that needs further clarification.\n- The quantization of $C^{(l)}$ is performed dimension-wise, can the authors be more specific on how step 4 is performed? \n- There is a well known label switching issue under clustering, in step 5 to sum up $q^{(l)}$ at the server, will there be any issue if the label is switched? The reviewer believes switching label at the first place will lead to different $q^{(l)}$ at the first place and hence $q$, this could potentially be a severe issue for clustering.\n\n2. For removing adversarial points, will the cost be necessarily smaller than refitting the model? This is not discussed as the magnitude of $\\epsilon_2$ and $s_{\\text{min}}$ is not specified in the main paper.\n\nMinor issues:\n\n1. Could the author ellaborate more on the difference between $\\phi_f$ and $\\phi_{c}$? The value of these two terms are equal when $C=C_s$, are there any particular reason to define two terms?\n\n2. Can the authors ellaborate more on the role of the hyperparameters $\\alpha$ and $p$ in the proposed method?",

The extensive theoretical analyses are derived to validate the performance guarantees of the proposed method.\n\n3. The algorithm is evaluated on a number of datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for machine unlearning.\n\nWeakness:\n1.\tAccording to algorithms 1 and 4, the unlearning process requires the help of removal set XR. This requirement is naturally fulfilled in the context of centralized unlearning but may not be available. In such case, the retraining in line 3 in algorithm 4 will always be required and significantly increase the complexity.\n2.\tThe unlearning strategy in this paper relies heavily on the k-means++ algorithm, which approximates the k-means problem proposed in 2007. The paper exploits the nature of k-means++ initialization with no technical improvement, making the novelty and contribution questionable.\n3.\tLine 2 in algorithm 1 implies that the centroid set C can remain the same if the removal point is not inside the centroid set C without further restrictions. This is very questionable when a certain number of biased data points are removed within a single request. In the unlearning experiment setting, the unlearning requests are carried out with one data point per client at each round of unlearning, which is insufficient to evaluate the performance of the proposed unlearning method.
