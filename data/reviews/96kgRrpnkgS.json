The proposed framework uses the hyperbolic space to better represent complex multi-modal relationships. The topic model is also utilized. The proposed Chimera method is plug and play. Experiments verify its effectiveness when combine with existing multi-modal representation learning framework.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n+ This paper combines the topic model, hyperbolic space and Euclidean space to better model the complex relationships between modalities.\n+ The proposed Chimera method is plug-and-play. Diverse experiments are provided, validating that it can benefit the existing pre-trained models.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The authors claim that the hyperbolic space can better learn the complex cross-modal association. However, there is lacking strong evidence to support it. In table 4, the results of w HL (hyperbolic space) do not consistently outperform its w/o HL (hyperbolic space) counterpart. In addition, experiments only include the module effectiveness of HL. If using attention module in the Euclidean space replaces HL, could similar results be achieved?\n- In the introduction section, it states that Chimera has theoretical contribution to learn more semantic and complex relationships over modalities. However, it seems that the method section only provides the statement of the proposed framework, and the theoretical support does not well proved. \n- The ablation studies about the hyper-parameters are missing. Does the selection of hyper-parameters affect the model performance a lot?\n- This paper focuses on multi-modal representation learning, but the experiments only contain vision + language dataset.\n",

The paper provides enough experiment details for reproducibility\n3. The novelty of this paper is limited. For technical novelty, this proposed framework is combination of existing techniques (topic model, hyperbolic space, transformer, contrastive learning, ranking loss). Also, there is not enough technical support for such combination. For empirical novelty, the experiments are not inadequate and diverse enough. Only two V+L datasets are used. The downstream task only focuses on image-text matching.\n",
