The norm of the weight matrix in the proposed model is bounded to ensure the generalization error bound, the paper proves this theoretically. The experimental section in the paper shows that the generalization performance depends on the number of attention heads, the number of neighbors at each given node, the upper bound of weights norm, the number of hidden layers, the upper bound of inputs norm, and the number of labeled nodes. Their empirical results match the theoretical expectations (this is shown in figure 1).\n",

So one would expect to see the performance of the proposed method on multivariate time series and compare the performance to other methods. Yet the paper has no empirical experiments showing the performance of forecasting tasks. This makes me question the capabilities of the proposed GAT when compared to other neural methods for practical forecasting applications.",

The paper shows that this can be done by bounding the weight matrix.\n\nReproducibility -- Good:\nThe paper provided the code to replicate the experiments in section 6 showing that the theoretical bounds match the empirical error generated by the model.

            "summary_of_the_review": "The main weakness of the paper is that it has no empirical experiments comparing the performance of GAT to other networks. While I appreciate the theoretical guarantees multivariate time series forecasting is a very practical topic and convincing the AI community to use a method must come with some strong empirical results. Proving error bounds is great but it is not enough, unfortunately. If the authors would like to provide this paper as a purely theoretical paper the title and area should have been different so more theoretical reviewers could have been assigned.\nIf the paper had strong empirical results I would have happily accepted the paper.",

The theoretical analyses are based on upper bounding empirical Rademacher complexity of the class of functions represented by the graph attention network. The derived generalization bounds depend on the norm of weight matrices, the number of neighbors, the number of attention heads, and the number of layers. The theoretical claims are further validated by empirical results.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper attempts to provide a theoretical foundation to an important problem: the use of graph attention networks for multivariate time series forecasting. Using graphical information to capture correlations among variables in multivariate time series forecasting has gained a lot of interests recently. Although various GNN-based methods have been proposed and are shown to deliver state-of-the-art empirical performance, there is few rigorous study on the generalization error of these methods. Therefore the subject studied in this paper is very interesting. In addition, the paper is nicely written. The overall presentation is clear and easy to follow. The authors also carry out empirical experiments to validate all theoretical claims.\n\nHowever, on the other side, I have a few concerns/questions regarding the practical relevance of the theoretical setting in this work to multivariate time series forecasting.\n\n- Typically in multivariate time series forecasting, we do not have access to future C-step-away values of any series. This comes from the fact that in forecasting we never know what is going to happen in the future. However, in this paper, the authors assume that we are given the true future C-step-away values for a subset of time series. This assumption seems to be counter-intuitive and not very realistic. Can the authors comment on the assumption?\n\n- The authors assume that each node in the graph has the same degree. Moreover, in Theorem 1 the authors claim that \"we consider the most general formulation, which allows every node to attend on every other node\". I think that requiring each node to have the same degree, e.g., requiring that every node to attend to every other node, is in fact a limitation rather than being general. The general setting should be without assuming anything about the structure of the graph, or at least without assuming that the graph is degree-regular or complete. I think the authors should make it clear in the text about the limitations imposed by the assumptions.\n\n- In general, I feel like the setting in this paper, i.e, problem formulation in section 2.1 and the graph structure in section 2.2, is not really the typical setting for time series forecasting. It feels more like graph-based semi-supervised regression. For example, I couldn't find any characteristics in the problem setting that are special to time series forecasting. Moreover, I think that, in general, semi-supervised setting in more typical for classification rater than forecasting. Please correct me if I am wrong.\n\n- Because of the above points, I think that there is a gap between what the paper claims to solve and what the paper actually solves. It might be more appropriate if the paper has been framed as providing generalization bound for graph attention network on semi-supervised regression tasks.\n\nFinally, a minor question about the experiments: How did you construct the graph for the stock pricing dataset when you vary the node degrees? Is it kNN graph?",

However, in that case, the authors should clearly mention the scope of the paper upfront. The current introduction sounds as if they were boasting better forecasting accuracies.
