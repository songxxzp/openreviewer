            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on the problem of multi-person 3D motion forecasting. The proposed framework uses a dual-level transformer-based generative model, encoding the local (per person) and global (multi-person) motion histories to decode each individual future body motion. The framework has been comprehensively evaluated on different datasets such as CMU-Mocap, 3DPW and MuPoTS-3D and also a benchmark, SoMoF, and demonstrates its superior performance against SOTA frameworks.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1- The idea and motivation are clear and the submission is well presented, 2- a comprehensive literature review with relevant literature and research topics is covered 3- extensive experiments on different dataset and one related benchmark is provided, 4- the method achieved SOTA results on these datasets \n\nWeakness:\n\n1-considering most generative models are well studied in multi agent trajectory forecasting, the paper\u2019s technical contribution is yet relatively limited compared to the literature (though the problem here is not identical and the overall framework is yet different)\n\n 2- a better qualitative visualisation of results would be helpful for better understanding of the framework behaviour ",

Considering these aspects, I support the paper to be accepted in this venue. However I have some minor comments\n\n1-  on the presentation of qualitative results: it can barely understand anything from Figs 3-5. The Errors and the good results could be highlighted. The figures are also too small to distinguish anything meaningful. \n\n2- I am not sure if I found out how did the predicted samples from generative models are evaluated during inference? I think eventually one sample from a distribution should represent the final output and this should be decided independently from evaluating them against ground truth. Do you calculate the mode of the generated samples? If so how?\n\n3-  while the model is compared with most recent conference papers published on SoMoF benchmark, it would be great if the authors can comment on other published frameworks (eg workshop ones) which use very simple and non-transformer based frameworks with superior results. For comparison purpose, It would best if the authors make their results on SoMoF leaderboard published . ",

It is difficult to have an idea on how the model can perform in terms of mm of error.\nI suggest to use metrics like MPJPE or MAE to better understand the quantitative performances of the model.\n- improving models with social aspect of the human movement can be really effective for the model performances. I would like to see an ablative study on how this model can improve performances compared to standard  single person forecasting models.\nMy doubt about this system is that performances compared to sota single person forecasting models would be lower, on standard datasets that offer even multi person poses (CMU panoptic, 3DPW).",

The method is clearly introduced and the experiments are sufficient and convincing.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**:  \n1. In the proposed method, why are the latent codes of the social interactions defined as the same? What's the insight here? In my opinion, the interactions are also dynamically changing during the observations, which is also pointed in [1,2]. Some explanations should be included here. In addition, why consider social interactions on a global level? How about the local social interactions?\n\n2. In Sec. 3.1, Local-Level Modeling, $N$ different intents $z_{i}$ are extracted to generate independent future movements. Does $N$ represent the total number of people in one sequence or one batch or the whole dataset? I presume it is the number of people in one sequence or batch, then $N$ must vary in different sequences or batches. How to deal with this situation? More details should be included here.\n\n\n3.
