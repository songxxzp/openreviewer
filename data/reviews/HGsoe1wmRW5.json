            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper aims to address the problem of generating 3D molecules for a specific protein binding site by integrating both the autoregressive and diffusion generative processes. Specifically, this paper proposes a model FragDiff, which generates 3D molecules fragment-by-fragment auto-regressively. In each time step, the model generates a fragment around the pocket by an E(3)-equivariant diffusion generative model, predicting the atom types, atom coordinates, and the chemical bonds of the fragment. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. My most concerning part is the experience section and the performance of the proposed method.\n    - There are many metrics for the ligand itself (pocket-free, unconditional), and mostly for the fragments. It is quite confusing as the paper aims to propose a method for protein-specific generation, in which the binding affinity is the most important metric. \n    - The selected baselines in the paper are mostly optimized for the binding position/affinity. It is not fair to compare with them in these metrics, especially the proposed method in the paper is optimized for the ring/fragment generation.\n    - To compare these ligand-based metrics, it is better to use the ligand-base baseline models. \n2. The Vina score from Figure 5 seems poor. I agree that the Vina is not accurate for the binding affinity assessment, but it is a reference. Besides, authors said \"the distributions of FragDiff was similar to the test set.\", while the distribution of Pocket2Mol is more close to the test set in Vina. And I don't believe close to test-set is better. In short, the current experimental results cannot prove the proposed method is better than previous work in binding affinity assessment. \n3. What is \"Vina rmsd\" ?\n4. The inference efficiency. Since the autoregressive model and diffusion model are not efficient during inference, can the authors compare the generation efficiency of the method proposed in this paper with that of other models?\n5. Is the proposed a from-scratch protein-target based generation? From Sec. 3.4.1, it seems the training is based on fragment masking, and part of the molecule is retaining. Is part of the molecule is used when performing protein-target based generation?\n6. The training is still based on a fragment vocabulary. Did the authors check whether the generative fragments are in the vocabulary or not?\n7. The details of \"dummy element type\" is not provided. How do you define the dummy atoms during training?\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: Although the paper is well written, the design of the experiments looks confused, as many ligand-based (unconditional generation) metrics are used, while the proposed model is structure-based generation. \n\nQuality: The paper and the proposed method itself sound good.\n\nNovelty: Incremental, as diffusion models, fragment-based generation, and protein-target based generation are popular recently. \n\nReproducibility: Most details are provided, but some are not clear, refer to the main review. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this paper looks not ready for now. As a protein-target-based generative model, its experiment did not focus on protein-ligand binding position/affinity, but focused on ligand-based generation (pocket-free). So I recommend rejecting the paper.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "FragDiff is a new diffusion model that generates compounds for a given binding pocket. The generation is a mix of autoregressive modeling and diffusion that creates molecular fragments. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks are used to embed molecular graph information. At each diffusion step, the atom types and bond types are represented with discrete distributions and atom coordinates are represented with a continuous distribution. To select the attachment point for the new fragment, a focal predictor is trained. Additionally, a molecule discriminator is trained and used for filtering unrealistic compounds after generation. FragDiff is compared against several recent generative models in terms of structure similarity to the reference set, QED, SA, and Vina scores.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The notation used to explain the model is clear and easy to follow.\n- The architectural choices are reasonable, e.g. defining the diffusion of atom types and bond types using a discrete distribution and coordinates with a Gaussian distribution, the use of E(3)-equivariant networks.\n- The model equivariance is proven.\n- A filtering method based on a discriminator network is prepared and proven to improve the quality of generated compounds.\n- The results show that FragDiff can generate realistic 3D structures, at least as well as other recent pocket-based generative models.\n- The example of compound generation in Figure 6 shows that the model produces reasonable fragments.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- In the abstract, it is argued that current autoregressive models generate one atom at each step. This is certainly not true for all the current models, e.g. see [1, 2]. In the second paper, the fragments are generated using VQ-VAE.\n- The statement that \u201cthe world\u2019s first drug designed by AI\u201d was recently proposed is exaggerated given the following criticism about the structural similarity to the existing compounds. Also, \u201cdrug candidate\u201d would be a better word choice.\n- The motivation about using diffusion models to generate fragments is unclear for more. What do we gain exactly?\n- For the molecule discriminator, it is said that fake counterparts of molecules are created by adding noise. What kind of noise is added to the molecules? The discriminator training could be described in more detail.\n- I am wondering if the filtering procedure based on the discriminator is not too heavy. How many compounds on average are filtered? Could this post-processing method improve the results of other generative models in the benchmark? \n- I am confused about the guidance ablation. What was the goal of implementing this ablation study? Were other weights of the pocket-specific and pocket-free models tested as well?\n- Some figures are illegible. More specifically, Figure 2 compares the statistics of the generated compounds against the training set, but the columns corresponding to each model are very narrow and difficult to compare with the baseline. It would be far more clear if each model distribution was compared against the training set on a separate plot, or, for the sake of paper length, the baseline distribution could be marked at least in a different way (e.g. a line) to make the other bars wider and easier to distinguish.\n- In Figure 2, there are zeros in the row corresponding to the training set.

The model description is rather clear, but there are a few typos across the text, and some figures are illegible. Some architectural choices could be motivated better. Also, I am not fully convinced by the paper motivation as fragment-based models already exist in the literature. Why do we need diffusion models to achieve that?\n\n**Quality.** The conducted experiments show many different aspects of the model, which is compared against a reasonable set of recent generative models. The paper contains a good proportion of both quantitative and qualitative results.\n\n**Novelty.** The use of diffusion models to generate fragments is a new concept that is executed well in the paper.\n\n**Reproducibility.** The implementation is not available.
