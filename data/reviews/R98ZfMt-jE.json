            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors of this work propose a fast algorithm for the computation of the discrete multi-marginal optimal transport problem (MMOT). The algorithm is derived from the dual form of the problem and has an explicit form for the gradient w.r.t. the objective. This makes it much faster than automatic differentiation. The algorithm is applied to fairness problems and image translation, demonstrating its effectiveness in both domains.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The authors should improve the writing of the paper. The overall logic is not smooth. In section 4.1, by using terminologies like \u201cforward\u201d, \u201cbackward\u201d, \u201cinner loop\u201d, \u201couter loop\u201d, the authors already assumed the readers know how the proposed tool is combined with NN, which can actually have many different forms. The definition of this combination is instead introduced in Section 4.2. In Section 4.2, the authors failed to clearly explain why the histograms are needed (although this can be vaguely inferred from some other literature). There are also some minor issues, such as the misusage of \\citep and \\citet in line 15 of introduction and line 5 of page 3.\n\nI am confused about the contribution of the work. Please correct me if I misunderstand anything: On the theoretical side, the authors prove the second half of Theorem 4.3, i.e., derive the gradient of the objective, which is essentially just the gradient of an LP problem. On the methodology side, the authors apply the derived gradient directly to the backward pass, which is a well-known trick to speed up the computation for problems where there are optimization problems in the forward pass. On the application side, the authors apply the proposed method to fairness, invariant representations, and image translation, where none of the applications are newly set-up. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is not as good as Li (2014) and Xie (2017). \n\n\n",

This would make the work more solid and complete. ",

The approach applies to cases with Monge cost, which while a special case, the authors argue is relatively general. A generalized earth-mover distance is introduced, which is linear in the dimensions and bins in theory, and show that in practice can lead to orders of magnitude speed up relative to existing methods. Empirical results are demonstrated in fairness cases as well as image translation. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths: \n- OT is a method of increasing importance in the machine learning literature. \n- Multi marginal OT is potentially important but hampered by significant computational costs that scale poorly with additional dimensions. \n- The theory clearly demonstrates the computational opportunity, which is nicely confirmed experimentally. \n- The empirical demonstrations show that the approach can be deployed on interesting problems. \n\nWeaknesses: \n- I did not find any particularly notable weaknesses of the paper. While the setting is clearly a restriction of the broader MMOT problem, the authors convincingly argue that it is not as much a restriction as one might think, and the computational gains are significant and worthy of the compromise.
