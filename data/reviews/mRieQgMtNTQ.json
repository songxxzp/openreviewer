            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposed denoising diffusion probabilistic model for image restoration. They specially applied null-space projection at every iteration to target variable x and used A^T y as range spaced values. By considering only null-space contents in reverse process, they achieved realistic images with data consistency. They demonstrated several image restoration applications: super-resolution, inpainting, colorization",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "They introduced null-space decomposition during reverse process in DDPM which helps to pursue robust data consistency and realistic image reconstruction. The detailed descriptions toward it are given in Algorithmic tables and associated illustration. It's easy to understand. Their supported results in Figure 3 and 4 are quite good qualities. The results seem to be beyond the bar of quality in ICLR.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit afraid that the result seems to be far from original contents, which brings fake information such as figure 3 at 32x super-resolution on CelebA. It looks like a posterior sample not like a reconstruction results. In my opinion, 32x SR results can not be called as reconstruction, it's a synthetic image. DDNM provides 32x32 pixels out of 1pixel, and it's hard to avoid referring contents from synthetic textures of training manifold. Therefore, especially for face datasets, I couldn't accept it as recovered result. It is closer to synthesizing images irrelevant with ground-truth. Thus, I recommend the authors to provide residual images and ground-truth images  in super resolution example and other examples, too.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "In method section, authors provided clear description about their claims on Null space refining and summarized well in pseudo codes at Algorithm1 & 2. Except ablation study on effectiveness of Null space projection lacks. Comparisons with DDRM may be different from such ablation studies.\n\nThe quality of results is fine when we review result table 1 and supplementaries. However, I have some doubts on comparison with other supervised learning methods. Basically, their model, DDNM, is also necessary to see ground-truth set for training a generative model, so it would be similar situation with supervised learning setup: train on ground-truth set and then inference on unseen testset. Thus, it may be important to see comparisons with supervised learning baselines in result tables (currently, this paper is compared only with DDPM-based generative models.\n\nIn the perspective of novelty, this paper reminds me following paper,\nSong, Yang, et al. \"Solving inverse problems in medical imaging with score-based generative models.\" ICLR (2022).\nThis paper also introduced SDE for inverse problems and they use very much similar steps for sampling. Major difference from this work is the existence of null space projection of target x in reverse process. I'm convinced of the superiority of this manuscript upon the mentioned paper.\n\nThe paper contains detailed pseudo codes enough to be implemented, however, there is no actual source code and information for neural network's architectures.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In general, this paper is well written and supported by remarkable results. The idea using null space component for residual components in reverse process in DDPM seems to be interesting. However, their approach is similar with the paper from ICLR 2022(above). Unless I see the performance difference with the ICLR 2022 paper or proper explanation of distinguishable points, I would be a doubt on effectiveness of null space projection. \n\nAlso, I have a concern that reconstructions from severe conditions go beyond image restoration and become closer to arbitrary image synthesizing. To avoid such concerns, the results from supervised learning need to be demonstrated together.",
