In the proposed method, the authors regard the salient region proposed by DNN explainability methods such as CAM as a selected hypothesis. Since the hypothesis proposed by the model is not independent of the data, instead of classical inference with selection bias, the authors proposed to use selective inference where the inference is conditioned on a selected event. The authors also demonstrated the validity of the method through numerical and real datasets. \n\nThe main contributions of this work:\n\n1. The authors employed the selective inference framework to compute a p-value to quantify the reliability of a salient region proposed by a saliency model to overcome the selective bias problem. \n\n2. The authors also claimed to have provided a Keras-based implementation to efficiently and flexibly conduct conditional SI for salient regions for a wide class of CNNs.\n\n3. The authors conducted experiments on both synthetic and brain image datasets and claimed the proposed method is able to control the false positive rate (FPR) and has potential to be applied to practical applications. \n",

The authors claimed to have implemented the proposed method in an efficient way and provided the code for reproducibility.\n\n5. The experiments provided also supported the claims made by the authors regarding the validity and applicability of the proposed method on practical problems. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1.

On the line after equation (12), it is claimed that the variable Z is normally distributed, which is an important assumption for subsequent derivations to calculate the p-value. It could be further explained why it is normally distributed. \n\n3. The authors claimed that their Keras implementation of Auto-Conditioning is efficient, but provides no asymptotic analysis of the computational complexity of their algorithm. This is important when applying this method to practical applications. \n\n4. When using the brain image dataset in the experiment, does it matter which image is selected as the reference for the proposed method to work? What is the effect of selecting different reference images? \n\n5. The authors performed experiments using a synthetic dataset and a real brain image datasets, and compared the False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate of the proposed method and some other methods for the synthetic dataset.

The current description does not fully disclose this paper's contribution. Please clarify.\n\n\n### B2. Justification for the test statistic in Eq. (4). The test statistic is defined as\n> $\nT(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{X}^{\\text{ref}}) = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{M}_{X}} |X_i - X_i^{\\text{ref}}|\n$\n\nThis is pixel-wise comparison of the elements within the salient region.

What is the practical application for performing a two-sample test when the test-outcome depends on the provided reference?

The paper states that for piecewise linear network\n> This is also true for the saliency map function $\\mathcal{A}_i(\\mathbf{X})$.\n\nI believe this statement is inaccurate, it depends on which saliency method is used. \n\nAdditionally, is this assumption true in practice? Typically, saliency methods are applied to classifier networks which contain softmax non-linearities for CNNs; similar issues with, the recently popular, transformer achirectures. \n\nHence, the title \u201cDeep learning-driven\u201d salient region seems to be a bit of an overstatement.\n\n\n### B5.
