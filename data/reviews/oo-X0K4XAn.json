            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes to learn an energy-based conditional generative model from trajectories of multiple particles. Specifically, the model (i) uses a graph neural network to encode partial trajectories into typed relations (each type is equivalently seen as a constraint) and then (ii) uses such information to define an energy score function by summing all the energy contributions of each relation. A standard gradient-based procedure for energy-based models is used to sample the full trajectory given the extracted relations, thus acting as a decoding process. The proposed model is learnt by maximising the conditional log-likelihood.\n\nFrom a conceptual point of view, the work differs from related approaches, including the neural relational inference (NRI), in the sense that it tackles the same problem of NRI using an energy-based formulation instead of a VAE one. From a computational point of view, the work replaces the explicit decoder in NRI with a sampling procedure (involving the use of second-order derivatives). From a task point of view, the energy-based formulation enables to tackle some challenges currently out of reach for NRI, including the OOD detection and the conditional generation of additional user-defined constraints (e.g. constraints defined as differentiable functions on the trajectories) introduced at test time.\n\nExperiments are conducted on 2 toy datasets, namely springs and charged particles, and 2 real datasets, including NBA SportVU and JPL Horizons.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strengths**\n- The paper is well-written. I enjoyed reading it.\n- The idea of learning an energy-based model in the dynamics setting is to my knowledge new. Maybe you can also consider some recent related work [1].\n- The proposed solution enables to tackle new challenges for the toy cases (OOD and conditional generation with user-defined constraints) and therefore has a good potential.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n- Several experimental comparisons against NCI are missing and should be included (see below for further details).\n- Code is not available.\n\nRegarding the first weakness:\n- Experiments (general) Computationally speaking, it is not clear how the proposed model compares against NRI. Specifically, while NRI uses an autoregressive model for the decoding process, NCI uses a gradient-based procedure for sampling, which requires the computation of second-order derivatives during training. How are these derivatives handled during training? And can you provide a discussion and perhaps a quantitative comparison both for training and inference with NRI?\n- Experiments (general). The proposed model is in essence a conditional generative model. How does the model generalise to predictions at future time steps larger than the ones seen during training? As far as I understand, the model can be iteratively applied by setting the initial state of the sampling process to the last generated portion of the trajectory, thus enabling to see further in the future. Is this correct? If so, why not comparing on this task against NRI?\n- Experiments (general). How does the model generalise to a different number of objects seen during training?\n- Experiments (toy) on traditional generation and edge classification tasks. In Table 1, NCI seems to achieve similar performance to NRI. In which sense is the model outperforming NRI, can you elaborate more on that? Additionally, I found a bit confusing the experiments on edge classification, as NCI is clearly inferior to NRI. What is the message here?\n- Experiments (real) why there is no comparison with NRI?\n\nRegarding the second weakness:\n\nAre you planning to integrally release the code?\n\nSome minor comments/curiosities:\n- The maximization of the conditional log-likelihood requires to minimize the energy score for training data while maximising it for generated data. Why this second optimisation term is not used in all the experiments, but only for OOD detection (as mentioned in the Appendix A)?\n- In Table 1, please add the lower bound baseline with known graph.\n- Can you think of other real cases other than the NBA dataset where additional constraints can be specified?\n- Last paragraph in the introduction: decompositionS of interactions is disentagleMENT -> decomposition of interactions is disentangled.\n\n[1] ModLaNets: Learning Generalisable Dynamics via Modularity and Physical Inductive Bias (ICML 2022)",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "**CLARITY**\n\nThe paper is well written.\n\n**QUALITY**\n\nOverall, the technical part of the paper is reasonable and complete. The experimental evaluation can be strengthened by adding additional comparisons with NRI (as mentioned above).\n\n**NOVELTY**\n\nThe idea of solving the considered problem by using an energy-based model is new and original. In particular, the work contributes to extend previous results on the composable properties of energy-based models (which have been previously observed for unconditional generative tasks) to the relational dynamic setting.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "------- POST REBUTTAL -------------\n\nThe answers in the rebuttal partially address my concerns. Doubts still remain on the nature of the method and the experimental methodology (both in terms of predictive performance and computational cost).\n\nThe proposed model learns a conditional distribution $p(x|x_{partial})$, where $x$ and $x_{partial}$ are the full and partial trajectories, respectively. The definition in Section 4.3 Eq. (3) is not appropriate. The model is not conditioned on the constraints, which are learnt and not given, but it is conditioned on the partial trajectories. This is not only a minor technical issue, but it has also an important practical consequence. In fact, the model is, in all effect, autoregressive and the experiments should take into account this fact.\nMy original concern about the comparisons with neural relational inference (NRI) still remain after the rebuttal. In both old and new experiments, NRI outperforms the proposed method in terms of predictive performance for step 1 (both on toy and real data, see for example \"General comments 2/2 part. 2.2\"). However, when considering larger future steps predictions, namely 10 and 20 (for real), the phenomenon is inverted. This sheds some lights on the unfair methodology used in the comparisons. The proposed method has been trained to deal with predictions (up to 20 steps) contrarily to NRI, which deal with them in an autoregressive way. Therefore, the authors should consider the same conditions for comparisons and treat their model as an autoregressive one.\n\nAdditionally, the analysis in terms of computation for the proposed approach provided in the rebuttal is not informative. The authors have shown an empirical comparison against NRI by considering fixed values of batch size and trajectory length. What does it happen when increasing the number of particles, their feature dimensionality or the trajectory length? I expect that the computation of second-order derivatives (required by the training/decoding component) becomes quickly intractable in these cases, whereas NRI is still able to handle them. However, such analysis is still elusive and missing.\n\nOverall, I think that the idea of using an energy-based model is nice as enabling to handle new tasks, including OOD detection and dealing with new constraints at test time. However, I feel that the experimental analysis is still not complete and the main claims are not well supported (see e.g. in the abstract \"achieving more consistent long-rollouts than existing\napproaches\"). Consequently, I decrease my score.",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n - The paper addresses an important problem in an interesting way, based on a clear motivation.\n - The method is sensible and clearly presented.\n - The quantitative empirical results are convincing and support the authors' claims.\n - The method's capabilities are thoroughly explored through additional experiments.\n\nWeaknesses:\n - The novelty of the paper is put into question by a concurrent work (see below).\n - The qualitative results seem to generally match the claims in the text, but are somewhat hard to read from static images. It would be useful if the authors would provide video comparisons of the predicted trajectories.\n - The claim of long-term stability of the rollouts could be explored further, beyond the 20 timesteps measured in Table 1. While due to the chaotic nature of the systems considered, it cannot be expected that predicted trajectories exactly match ground truth beyond this point, long term stability may still be evaluated. For instance, by providing long video sequences, or by measuring the degree to which physical conservation laws hold (as in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.02425.pdf Fig. 5).\n\n\n",

As discussed above, clarity of the qualitative results could be improved by providing videos. The appendix includes a detailed description of implementation details, which should suffice to reproduce the work. No code has been submitted, however.\n\nThe paper's proposed method appears novel, except for significant overlaps with a concurrent work (Rubanova et al., ICML 2022). The latter also proposes predicting trajectories by optimizing their adherence to a set of learned constraints. The main difference appears to be that the constraint function in Rubanova et al. is learned globally, whereas in the present work, their are inferred by an encoder network. This allows taking latent differences between interactions into account (e.g., charge polarity of particles). Additionally, the focus of the empirical evaluation is slightly different, with this paper putting a greater emphasis on disentanglement.\n\n\nQuestions and minor comments:\n - The attraction figure (Fig. 7) suggests that the particles' trajectories are printed starting with dark, opaque dots, which get increasingly lighter and more transparent as time passes. Intuitively, I would have expected the opposite direction. It might be useful to make this arrow of time more clear, at least in the few experiments in which it matters.\n - Is each predicted trajectory initialized entirely from noise, or is the known partial trajectory utilized?\n - How can the baseline models observe the randomized latent properties of the trajectories, such as the presence of springs or charge polarity? E.g., interaction networks by default only take a small number of prior observations into account, which might not be enough to infer interaction modes. Isn't this an unfair disadvantage?",
