            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose a Windowed Feature Importance in Time\n(WinIT) method for explaining time series predictions. They have also investigated the evaluation approaches with different complementary masking strategies. Experiments have been conducted to show the proposed approach performs well in synthetics and real-world data sets.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "S1: The paper proposes a method for solving the challenges in explaining time series predictions. \n\nS2: The paper is well structured and easy to follow.\n\nS3: Experiments are comprehensive.\n\n\nW1: The proposed method looks incremental. The measure of feature importance at a time step follows the measure of Tonekaboni et al. (2020) by extending it to prediction difference and Jensen Shannon divergence.\n\nW2: The algorithm needs more justifications. The reason for the average over a window of size N is unclear to me. The window size N introduces another parameter to tune. Also, the definition of $i(S)^b_a$ needs more justifications. \u201cWe formulate the importance in Eq. 1 as a difference due to the time series nature of the data\u201d is not clear enough to explain the intuition. Figure 1b has not been explained in the text. What does exactly $i(S)^b_a$ mean? Is a large (or small) value of $i(S)^b_a$ preferred? Without these explanations, Figure 2 is not easy to understand.  Furthermore, the predictions of time series with the information being masked should be presented. It is confusing that the predictions in all three cases (a) (b) and (c) are the same (the right hand sides before and after the minus symbol '-'). I wonder why $i(S)^b_a$s are different in the three cases when the predictions before and after masking are the same. \n\nW3: The example of Figure 1 is too simple to show teh usefulness of the proposed method.  In Figure 1,  Y is determined by a single signal. Many time series predictions are determined by patterns (multiple signals). There needs an example to show that the proposed importance measure can handle pattern signals to convince readers that EinIt is useful for real world applications.\n\nW4: In Figure 4, the AUC drops and Prediction changes are quite inconsistent. Can authors provide some explanations?\n",

It provides an importance score for each feature in a multivariate time series according to explainability, considering the dependencies of features between time steps and variation in feature importance over time. The method considers differences between consecutive time points and measures importance over multiple time steps to quantify temporal variation in importance. The novelty is in combining these two aspects in the importance score. Analyses on synthetic and real data sets are used to demonstrate advantages and consistency compared to currently available alternatives and assess model evaluation.",
