The first is to balance representations by minimizing group distance and maximizing individual propensity confusion (i.e., PDIG). The second is to use both pre-balancing and post-balancing representations for outcome prediction (i.e., PPBR). ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength: \n\nThe proposed method is supported by two bounds of the expected estimation error of heterogeneous treatment effects. The first bound of treatment effect estimation error uses the Wasserstein distance between treated and control groups. The second bound of treatment effect estimation error uses H-divergence as a measure of propensity confusion.\n\nWeakness:\n\nThe connection between the two components (PDIG and PPBR) could have been better elaborated. For example, how is PDIG helpful for PPBR? Furthermore, it would be nice to provide an example of why it is important to account for pre-balancing representations for outcome prediction. A simple numerical example could be useful to understand intuition. \n",
