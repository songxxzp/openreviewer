Exploiting a context-invariant contrastive learning and a mutual information minimization-based disentangling to disentangle the factors, and providing an explainable results about the different factors.\nC3.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an intrinsic-extrinsic disentangled model named IEDR for recommendation. The idea is that user-related (or item-related) features are intrinsic factors that don't change with time, while contextual features are extrinsic factors that change with time.\n\nThus they aim to get the intrinsic factors by maximizing the agreement between the encoded representation of the same user under different contexts, and minimizing the agreement between the encoded representation of the same context with different users. This is done by optimizing an InfoNCE loss in the contrastive learning module.\n\nBesides, they also try to disentangle extrinsic factors by minimizing the mutual information between the extrinsic factors and the above-generated intrinsic factors.\n\nExperiments are conducted on two public datasets to conclude the superior performance of IEDR in contrast to other CTR prediction models.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "S1. Overall, the paper is well-organized and well-written. The main idea is clearly illustrated and the figures are quite helpful for understanding the proposed IEDR method.\n\nS2. They conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets, including performance comparison, ablation study, visualization, and case study. The main comparison results are promising and the other results meet their expectations.\n\n---\nW1. The main concern is about the motivation of the proposed method. The paper claims that intrinsic factors are user-related (or item-related) factors that don't change with context, while extrinsic factors are contextual features that don't change with user or item. \n\nThen it is straightforward to just use user-related and item-related features as intrinsic factors, and use contextual features as extrinsic factors. It doesn't bring any benefit to getting the intrinsic factors by extracting context-free factors from the input of both contextual features and user (item) features. Thus the method seems to be superfluous as it is trying to seek an inferior answer with the best answer in mind.\n\nI have noticed the clarification of preventing the trivial solution in Appendix C. But I don't think it is a trivial solution to map user features to intrinsic factors and to map contextual features to extrinsic factors, because they are just the right answer according to both the motivation and the proposed method.\n\nW2.  Although the paper conducted experiments on two public datasets, the used datasets are both very small datasets with less than one million samples, which hurts the convincing of the comparison results. It is strongly suggested to add results on benchmark CTR prediction datasets like Avazu or Taobao.",

The authors explain that Taobao and Avazu datasets are not suitable for the scenario because they only span less than two weeks. But there are some other available benchmark datasets like Movielens-20M with timestamp features that span decades. My suggestion is that at least the main comparison result should also be provided for the two Amazon datasets in addition to Frappe and Yelp.\n\nDue to the above points, I would like to raise my score to marginally above the acceptance threshold.",
