            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper considers a 3D geometric GNN, and develops a novel message passing scheme considering the directional effects from an external field or from a set of particles unreachable in a graph. If we place a molecule in an electric field, we need to take it into account when calculating the potential energies of the molecule. The developed scheme is a perfect fit to the cases, for example, (A) a geometric graph in R^3 with edge connections by distance cutoff, where long-range interactions beyond the cutoff are ignored during message passing, and (B) QM/MM situations where we consider a set of particles in quantum mechanics (QM), but other particles treated in molecular mechanics (MM). The idea for this is to prepare a state tensor (anisotropic state) M_i^k for each node i, and used in message passing. M_i^k is defined by linear combinations of basis, i.e., the tensor product of order k of the unit vector from node_i to a neighbor j, where coefficients are learned by neural nets. This corresponds to multipole expansions of an angle-dependent function on R^3, which is often used in computational chemistry (monopoles, bipoles, dipoles, ...). The paper also provides case studies of water dimer cases (interactions between 2 H2O molecules) and water cluster (a set of many water molecules) as well as QM9 benchmarking with geometric graphs with an edge cutoff of 5 angstrom. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "[Strength]\n\n- The proposed scheme of Anisotropic Message Passing (AMP) is an interesting and natural scheme to consider any directional effects from an external field or any long-range effects from a set of particles unreachable in the graph used for message passing. When we use any 3D geometric GNN, message passing is often done within cutoff ranges rather than complete graph having edges between all pairs of nodes for efficient computation. But this ignores long-range interactions between atoms or particles. Not only this is suitable to considering the interactions to an external field such as QM/MM or multi-molecules cases, but also suitable for a single molecule case if we use distance-based edge cutoff (as demonstrated in QM9 cases of 4.4).\n\n- The idea to introduce anisotropy is based on multipole expansions with respect to introduced \"internal anisotropic states\", which sounds convincing and neat. It would be well motivated when we consider such directional/angular effects in computational chemistry. The use of series expansion sounds well suited because, similarly to Taylor series, the first term has a good approximation of the original function, and higher-order terms are correction terms to represent deviations of the approximation due to the k-order directional effects (we can control the approximation precision by setting the order k). Also, the use of such anisotropic states in message passing corresponds to multipole-multipole interactions that are also well discussed in the computational chemistry literature as cited.\n\n- The paper comes with three nice case-study demonstrations: (i) 2 of water molecules (water dimers), (ii) QM/MM calculations of 6-20 water molecules (water cluster), (iii) five molecules of varying size solvated in water (a realistic QM/MM system example from B\u00f6selt et al. 2021), (iv) QM9 dataset with edge cutoff of 5 angstrom.\n\n\n[Weaknesses]\n\n- As we can see in Figure 2 (water dimer cases), if we have a complete graph (edges are formed between all nodes), then we don't need to use this AMP and just use standard message passing. So I felt that one of big values of this paper would be practical efficiency. Given that we often apply distance cutoff for geometric message passing, this point is also appealing, but the paper can have any discussions and concrete results on how inefficient if we consider a complete graph for message passing.\n\n- \"directional interactions\" in the title was easy to get, but \"long-range interactions\" in the title were unclear to me at first glance. When we use a 3D geometric GNN such as SchNet and DimeNet (unlike 2D non-geometric GNNs), we can apply message passing to all pairs of nodes in theory. We don't necessarily need to apply distance cutoff to edges if the practical efficiency is OK (in the case of small molecules?). It would be nice to have descriptions on this to make clear this point.\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper implicitly assumes several computational chemistry ideas (which were not easy to follow for me, an outsider), but well written in total. The paper covers relevant literature about ML potentials and ML for the simulation of QM/MM systems. They also provide the code base, and the idea is clean and simple. Thus the paper's results and conclusions would be reproducible. I don't know much about the related literature on ML potentials / ML+simulation / Physics-/Chemistry-informed ML published in non-ML venues (such as chemistry or chemoinfo journals), but as far as I know, the idea of this paper is novel.\n\nI think I understood the point of the last sentence on Page 3 \"Albeit possible, they do not necessarily carry physical meaning.\" But further investigations and clarifications on this point would be a promising research topic. It was very interesting to me that the main idea of this paper comes from standard techniques (multipole expansions) in computational chemistry, but it is just prepared through learning parameters, and indeed, \"they do not necessarily carry physical meaning\" (Nevertheless, it worked apparently)\n\nThree minor comments/questions on details:\n\n- p.3, \"r_^0_{ij} = 1\" below eq(2) should be \"R_^0_{ij} = 1\"...?\n\n- p.4 eq (8), a_{ij} in the first equation should be \"u_{ij}\"...?\n\n- AMP(k) can be worse than AMP(k+1) because increasing k means increasing the number of model parameters (and might make the learning harder)...?

            "summary_of_the_review": "Basically, I liked the paper. In order to consider the effects from an external field (directional interactions) or those from unreachable nodes (long-range interactions), this paper develops a novel message passing scheme called Anisotropic message passing. The directional or long-range contributions are formulated by a multipole series expansion with learnable coefficients. The use of series expansion is also a good fit for me. Then the entire long-range or directional effects are modeled via message passing with multipole-multipole interactions as the proposed Anisotropic Message Passing (AMP) scheme of order k. Also, the empirical evaluations with four nice use cases are very convincing.\n",

For the experiment about water dimers, the seems to be no difference between the curves when k=1 and k=2 in Figure 2A. However, the authors mention that \"the learning task seems to be more challenging for the AMP(1) compared to the AMP(2) model, indicated by marginally larger errors\", which is misleading. Moreover, the authors claim that Dimenet and PaiNN \"seem to fail to describe this quadrupole-quadrupole interaction\" without having convincing experimental results. Lastly, the authors use the wrong name (\"Dime\") when referring to DimeNet.\n4. For the experiment about QM/MM systems, the comparison to the previous models is unclear. For example, Table 2 and 3 only show the results of the proposed model without having the results of other models. \n5. For the experiment on QM9 dataset, I'm feeling that this experiment is not very suitable to be shown here, since QM9 is mainly for the prediction of scalar molecular properties. I would suggest using MD17, which is a commonly used benchmark dataset that includes MD trajectories of small organic molecules. The goal is to predict energies and forces, which is more suitable for the proposed model.\n6.
