In particular, these modules are defined as \"consciousness-aware\" in an analogy to actions that a \"consciousness-aware\" human being do. However, we can not say that this system  possess awareness, nor phenomenal consciousness, just because of that. Hence, the title of the paper is misleading. It is a good paper but several terms must be changed. I would talk about attention or access consciousness but not awareness. ",

            "summary_of_the_review": "The main issue of this paper is their use of the words consciousness and awareness. Consciousness is a property that we cannot assign freely to machines without accepting lots of assumptions that can not be validated with the scientific method like multiple realizability and functionalism. Those can be reviewed in a philosophy of mind manual or even studied from a neuroscientific point of view. Even, Roger Penrose provides strong arguments against the emergence of consciousness in machines. Why is this algorithm in particular conscious, or aware, about itself? If it would, it need to catch qualia, and this assumption does not hold for a simple information processing algorithm such as the one present here. One thing is to talk about attention layers, which is valid, and another is just putting the title \"Consciousness-aware multi-agent reinforcement learning\". I can not accept the paper and need to recommend a strong reject, although technically is not that bad, just because of this. This seems to be a great multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm from an engineering perspective but it is not aware of itself. Please review the literature about philosophy of mind to learn more about this. We can hardly assume that this algorithm would simulate features about access-consciousness, but not awareness which is the same as phenomenal consciousness. Consequently, the title can not include \"consciousness\" nor the name of the modules. \n\nOutside of the discussion about consciousness:\n\nMultiple terms such as varying partial observability vs slight partial observability need to be better defined. \nI find a lack of cohesion between multiple parts of the paper, sections are written in a very straight-forward style. They need to be better introduced. \n\"Consciousness-learning\" does not make sense. \nThe related work section deliberately ignores work on consciousness, which is OK if the paper does not talk about consciousness.\nIt would be interesting to describe an example of observation function.\nFormalize the concept of dynamic team. \n\"mulit\" -> multi\nThe experiment section is repeated just with 6 different seeds. I recommend to repeat it using 25 different seeds or more to make the results  statistically more solid. ",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper describes a solution for improving performance in multi-agent reinforcement learning. The term \"consciousness\" in this work essentially refers to attention based mechanisms and to the fact that the authors adopt and approach that resides in the idea of dividing the general problem into sub-parts in order to tackle it. The work is evaluated by means of a series of experiments with testbeds, namely an apple picking task with obstacles, a resource collection task, a traffic junction navigation task and the StarCraft environment. \n\nThe paper is evaluated using a variety of tasks and this is definitely commendable. However, the evaluation does not show the actual contributions of the three key components/mechanism of the proposed solution, namely the entity dividing module, the consciousness enhancement for the local agent and the consciousness replacement.\n\nThe main contribution of the work is essentially in putting together a series of existing mechanisms in order to achieve better performance in the tasks under consideration. \n\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper considers the difficult problem of coordination of teams of agents for the execution of a complex task. The main mechanism used by the authors is the \"classic\" divide-and-conquer strategy. The goal is to deal with the problem of \"attention distraction\" in partially observed environments.\n\nThe use of term \"consciousness-aware\" is probably out of place, since the mapping to the concept of consciousness is actually very weak. Moreover, \"consciousness\" itself is about awareness, so the use of the term \"consciousness-aware\" might also be questionable. Some expressions should be really removed from the text such as \"...CAMA empowers agents with purposeful consciousness\". However, the reviewer believes that this is not the most important concern related to this work. One of the major weakness of this work is the fact that it looks like a composition of existing \"components\", which has somehow renamed and adapted. This would be fine, but the actual need for each of them is not supported by sufficient evidence.\n\nThe design of the different components is not completely new. They are essentially mechanisms that are mapped to existing work  in the area, which are correctly cited by the authors. \n\nA key problem that is essentially not tackled in a general way is the decomposition of the general problem into subproblems. The presentation of these mechanisms is very high level in the paper. It is difficult to understand how this is performed in general (and I would say also in the environments considered by the authors).\n\nThe authors present some theoretical results about the \"consciousness replenishment mechanism by local coach\", but they appear rather disjoint from the main text. It is not completely clear why they are relevant for this work. In particular, the relevance of Theorem 4.1 to this specific work is not apparent. In fact, the theorem considers a property of a system of 3 random variables. How is this mapped to the situations and environments under consideration?\n\nThe reviewer would like to suggest the authors to improve their evaluation by showing the actual contributions of the different mechanisms separately (and in composition) from the point of view of the actual performance obtained in the system. Ideally, a discussion about the generalizability of the approach would really contribute to make this work stronger.\n\n",

However, it is very difficult to understand how the different mechanisms used in the paper are put together. The choice of the values of the different parameters is also not completely justified, except for some of them. In general, the paper appears hard to reproduce.\n\nThe reviewer has also concerns in relation to the originality of this work, since it appears as a composition of a series of different mechanisms that have been studied in the literature before. There is value in studying how to integrate different mechanisms, but in my opinion, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence for showing the contributions of each of them. The theoretical results presented in the work appear as somehow disjoint from the rest of the paper.",

This is not a problem per se, but the design choices and the actual evidence supporting the need for these components is not satisfactory. The evaluation is not satisfactory since it does not really show the contributions in terms of performance of the different mechanisms. The theoretical foundations of this work are also not completely convincing. The authors include some theoretical results that are not key for the actual contribution of this work.

I would recommend that the authors tone this down.\n* The \"consciousness replenishment module\" is conceptually similar to the coach in COPA [1], though it is presented as a novel contribution with significant exposition dedicated to it. It should be described more in relation to the existing work to emphasize what the differences are.\n* Figure 3 is averaging attention across time steps and (presumably) attention heads, so it would be expected to be dispersed over the whole set of agents and entities (since many varying interactions may happen over the course of an episode). If one were to plot attention at a single time step from a single head and it still looked this dispersed, it would be a more effective argument for what the authors are describing. The reason it looks less dispersed in the SR=3 case is likely that agents spend many time steps in this setting only being able to observe themselves.\n* A thorough ablation study is needed to understand the significance of each component. For example, the loss functions that are unique to each module could be ablated.\n\n# Questions\n* From Figure 2, it seems like the entities in the complement of the selected mask are still used in computing the agent utilities, so why are they described as \"out-of-sight-range\"?\n\n[1] Liu, Bo, et al. \"Coach-player multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic team composition.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
