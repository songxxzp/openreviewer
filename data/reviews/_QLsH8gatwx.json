            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors introduce Simplicial Hopfield Networks \u2014 an architecture that extends the original Hopfield Network by allowing setwise connections in addition to pairwise connections between all neurons in the network. This reformulation allows higher memory capacity and performance and significantly increases the memory capacity of the traditional Hopfield Network.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "******************Strengths******************\n\n- (+ +) The idea of treating Hopfield Networks as simplicial complexes is enticing and indeed novel.\n- (+) The experimental results are minimal and simple, but still convincing. The memory capacity of a Hopfield Net, in the binary case, is noticeably improved by including higher degree connections.\n\n********************Weaknesses********************\n\n- (- -) The experimental results are minimal and simple. Only K=1 and K=2 simplices are considered (see below). In particular, the continuous case chooses only one \u201csimplicial model\u201d and applies it on MNIST, CIFAR, and Tiny ImageNet while comparing different similarity metrics. Comments:\n    - It would be useful to see behavior across simplicial models in the continuous case. In particular, perhaps, simplicial networks of higher order than just 2.\n    - Figure 2 describing these results is laid out such that it is very difficult to compare the baseline to the proposed model\u2026 This is fine, but perhaps a corresponding table like Table 2 for recall on the different datasets for one of the distance metrics would be preferable.\n- (-) The re-formulation of the Hopfield Network using simplices is convenient for mathematical proofs, but practically it can be computationally prohibitive to consider all the subsets that higher degree simplicial complexes create. This is shown by the experiments which exclusively considered pairwise and K=2 degree complexes. To sell the practical application of this idea, I encourage the authors to include experiments with higher order simplicial complexes, or to reconsider use of the hypergraph formulations as discussed in the Appendix.\n- (-) I found Figure 1 completely unhelpful in understanding the paper. 1B has no meaning to me, only that the weight distributions \u201clook\u201d the same at different simplices (there\u2019s not even a y-axis). 1C is not sufficiently explained and is equally meaningless to me.\n\n**Additional comments**\n\n- (-) Please revise the statement \u201cRamsauer et al. (2021) extended modern Hopfield networks to allow neurons to take continuous values \u2013 where previously they took only binary values\u201d. Ramsauer et al. claimed to have allowed Hopfield networks to take continuous states, but in fact continuous Hopfield networks were introduced by [Hopfield himself in 1984](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.81.10.3088). We want to correct this incorrect claim as much as possible in papers moving forward.\n- (-) There is no mention of code to be released for reproducibility.\n- (-) Notation in equation (5) is strange. Why input \u201c$\\ldots \\Xi^T S \\ldots$\u201d to the logsumexp when the RHS uses \u201c$\\ldots \\xi_\\sigma^\\mu S_\\sigma \\ldots$\u201d?\n- (-) Where does $M^2$ come from in equation (6)? This is seemingly copied directly from Ramsauer et al. and not defined here.\n\n**Questions**\n\n- The original HN uses a dot product, which is clearly a similarity measure where more similar inputs have a higher value. However, taking the Manhattan or Euclidean distance is a **********difference********** measure where more similar inputs have a smaller value. Is the inverse of the euclidean distance taken in the experiments? Please describe this for reproducibility.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes to add set-wise connections to pair-wise connections in the Hopfield networks. The main contribution of the paper is the claim that adding such connection improves the memory storage properties of these networks. Interesting biological mechanisms of building many-body synapses are also mentioned.   ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper connects many interesting ideas, such as Hopfield networks, simplicial complexes, many-body synapses in biology, etc. These are great topics, and it is nice to see them discussed in the paper. However, I am struggling understanding the core mathematical definitions of the proposed model. Specifically, \n\n1. I do not understand the definition and notations of the model (equation 1). Could the authors please write down (possibly in the appendix) the complete expression for the energy function in some toy model example (say 2 memory patterns, upto 3-simplex connections). I want to see the complete expression for the energy function written in terms of $S_i$ and $\\xi^\\mu_i$. \n\n2. Is the energy function (equation 1) a sum of the energy functions of Krotov & Hopfield 2016 with say 3-neuron connections, 2-neuron connections, 1-neuron connections? If so, are the weights of those connections independent of each other for 3-, 2- and 1- body interactions? In the model of Krotov & Hopfield, once the patterns $\\xi^\\mu_i$ are fixed (consider a power model for simplicity with n=3), the connectivity - symmetric tensor of the 3rd rank $w_{ijk}$ - is completely determined. This tensor has $N(N-1)(N-2)/6$ elements in it, but those elements are not independent. Are the authors proposing to declare some of the elements of this tensor to be zero, so that only those terms present in the simplicial complex are non-zero?  \n\n3. Also, I don\u2019t fully understand the definitions of the models considered in Table 1. For the conventional 2-body Hopfield network if the number of patterns is odd, then the connectivity matrix $w_{ij}$ has all non-zero entries. There is not any flexibility to delete any entries in it. How can the authors decrease the number of parameters from $N(N-1)/2$ to $0.75N(N-1)/2$? Which elements of the matrix $w_{ij}$ are deleted? Similarly, how do authors add 3-body connections? \n\nAdditionally, I do not understand the histograms in Figure 1B. If the memories in the Hopfield network are binary ($\\pm 1$) patterns and there are P of those, the elements of the weight matrix belong to the range $-P$ to $+P$ and are all integers. How do the authors get numbers smaller than 1 on the x-axis? Also, these three histograms look very similar to me. Is this what the authors are trying to illustrate by showing them? I somehow could not find a clear conclusion from these histograms in the text. \n \nContinuous modern Hopfield networks were introduced in Krotov & Hopfield 2016, not in Ramsauer et al. 2021. Ramsauer et al. 2021 generalized the model of Krotov and Hopfield (which used any rapidly growing neuron-wise activation function, e.g. power function) to the case of softmax activation function, and made the connection with transformers. However, the theoretical framework for continuous modern Hopfield networks has already been introduced in Krotov & Hopfield 2016, see for example equation (10) there, and numerical experiments with MNIST (all use continuous variables). \n\nWhile I greatly appreciate that the authors discuss legitimate biophysical mechanisms for building set-wise connections in the brain (Appendix A1), these set-wise connections can also be built from simple pair-wise connections by introducing additional hidden neurons, see for example https://openreview.net/forum?id=X4y_10OX-hX. This possibility should at least be mentioned somewhere in the paper. Even if one does not use more rarely discussed biophysical mechanisms mentioned by the authors in Appendix A1, there is nothing unbiological (except for shared weights) in many-body set-wise connections. \n\nTypo: the constant factor $T$ should be replaced by $1/T$ in equation (7). \n\nA small suggestions to the authors for making their formulas more compact (equations 5, 6): $\\frac{1}{T^{-1}} = T$. Also, the last two terms in equation (6) are just constants, thus can be dropped.\n\nThe notation $\\dot{S}$ in equations 2, 4, etc., is somewhat confusing, since it is often used for denoting the time derivative. While here, the authors use it for denoting the updated state of the network. I suggest that the authors either replace it by something else, or add a note the first time it appears in the paper about its meaning. \n",
