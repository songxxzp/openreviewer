            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes GraphVF, a novel method for generating 3D ligand molecules that can bind to specific target proteins. GraphVF adopts junction tree based scaffold encoding and SE(3)-invariant geometry encoding during training, and a variational flow framework to sequentially generate ligands atom-by-atom. GraphVF achieves good performance in ligand generation and drug property targeted generation tasks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n(+) This is the work that first considers generating molecules with good drug properties in ligand generation, which is very meaningful and useful for practical applications.\n\n(+) The effectiveness of the proposed GraphVF method is demonstrated by good performance in various experiments.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n(-) (major) The paper does not clearly motivate and explain the novelty contribution of GraphVF. The design of the generation process in GraphVF (use flow models to atom-by-atom generate ligands, generate 3D positions by distances, angles, and torsion angles) largely follows the existing method GraphBP [1]. To me, the only novelty contribution is to additionally encode ligand scaffolds with junction-tree based encoders. However, it is not clear why this scaffold encoding is used and important, since the ligand generation process does not include any junction-tree generation. It is strongly recommended to add detailed discussion to clarify the difference between GraphVF and GraphBP, and the importance of using scaffold encoding.\n\n(-) (major) It is not clear why a variational-inference-style flow model is used. As described in section 4.3 and figure 3, during training, the flow models output latent variables subjected to the Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_R,\\Sigma_R)$, but in loss function (equation 14-16) the latent distribution is optimized to be close to the standard Gaussian distribution, and the generation process with flow models also sample from the standard Gaussian distribution. Then what is the advantage of this method over directly modeling the outputted latent variables as the standard Gaussian distribution during training? Is it specially designed for controlled generation targeted at good drug properties? It is better to provide more detailed explanation or clarification.\n\n(-) (major) At each generation step of GraphVF, the bonds between the new atom and previously generated atoms are generated. However, prior 3D molecule generation methods (e.g., EDM [2] and GraphBP) do not explicitly generate bonds, but infer bonds from the generated 3D conformations, and they evaluate the bond valency validity. Hence, why GraphVF does not follow this setting? Do the generated bonds match those inferred from 3D conformations? And if possible, could authors report the bond valency validity in experiments?\n\n(-) (minor) Tables and figures in the paper do not follow some frequently used style habits in academic papers. It is better to make Figure 1, 2, 3 at the top of the page like Figure 4, make caption of Table 2 before the table, and use three-line (with \\toprule and \\bottomrule at the beginning and end of the table) for Table 2, 3, 4.\n\n(-) (minor) The description about EDM in the first paragraph of section 2 is incorrect. EDM generates 3D molecular conformations from scratch, not from 2D structures.\n\n(-) (minor) In section 3.2, use $b_i^{lig}\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{i-1}$ instead of $|b_i^{lig}|=i-1$ to represent an integer vector.\n\n[1] Liu, Meng, et al. \"Generating 3D Molecules for Target Protein Binding.\"\u00a0International Conference on Machine Learning.
