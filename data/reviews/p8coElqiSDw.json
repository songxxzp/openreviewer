This empirical study is well-motivated, the experiments are presented in a nice and descriptive manner, and this dataset can help other researchers and designers to design more robust models. \n\n-= S2 =- The paper is very well-written and provide a nice background on various adversarial attacks that can be leveled against a model. Additionally, the results are presented in an easy to understand manner. \n\n-= S3 =- The three use cases presented for this dataset are also well-motivated and evaluated. \n\n-= S4 =- Toward the end of the paper, the authors provide a set of empirical analyses on what aspects of the network are highly influential on robustness. These observations can help future researchers and designers of network. \n\n-= W1 =- The paper can benefit from providing more descriptive captions to the figures. It will be nice if the figures can be read in a standalone manner i.e., they explain what the results are. \n\n-= W2 =- The paper can benefit from discussing the results a little bit more. For instance, it is not clear what we observe in Figure 5 leads to high diversity of sensitivity to different kinds of corruptions. \n\n-= W3 =- The paper can benefit from explaining the experimental setup more explicitly, how many times do they repeat their experiments? What machines do they use? What are the hyperparmeters? etc. ",
