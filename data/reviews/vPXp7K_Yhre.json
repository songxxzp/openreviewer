            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies zero-sum polymatrix games where there are several kinds of delayed feedbacks. One such type is random delay, and another type is fixed delay. The paper gives new analyses for single-timescale and two-timescale OMWU proving last iterate convergence for the former and finite-time convergence for the latter.\n\nThe main conttribution is to systematically study the impact of having delays, when each player plays according to the entropy-regularized OMWU. Formally, for the case of synchronous updates single-timescale OMWU needs 1/epsilon iterations to reach an epsilon-Nash, and they extend it to the asynchronous setting with required number of iterations 1/epsilon^2. Furthermore, this requires several mild assumptions on the delays (roughly the delays are not completely adversarial, but are random). Moreover, if delays are constant and known, the authors obtain a 1/\\epsilong guarantee to \\epsilon Nash by adopting two-timescale OMWU. ",

The algorithms have been used before, which is both good and bad. Good because the algorithms are natural, bad in terms of the novelty. In some sense, the paper's main message is that delays can be handled and nothing goes too wrong with them, even using prior algorithms. My main concern has to do with the technical aspects of the paper: I am not too convinced that this is not an incremental set of results, given the extensive analyses for the setting without the delays.

The main algorithm is called OMWU (optimistic multiplicative weight updates) and comes in two variants: single-timescale and two-timescale. The analysis shows that single-timescale OMWU converges linearly if feedback is instantaneous or delays come from a distribution that vanishes exponentially. two-timescale OMWU achieves last-iterate eps-Nash convergence and average-iterate eps-QRE convergence when there are bounded adversarial delays. Convergence rates are generally linear.",

On the other hand, the experiments seem to be on synthetic data that is created to meet the hypotheses of the theorem, rather than being experiments on real data.\n\nWeaknesses:\n(1) I feel the introduction and motivation of the paper could have been written better. While I don't directly work in this field, I am conversant in it, yet I was not able to identify *exactly* why this problem is of interest (beyond it being a, generally speaking, \"natural question\"). Even starting at the second sentence \"While conventional wisdom leans towards the paradigm of centralized learning,\" I did not understand what this 'conventional wisdom' was or where it was coming from.\n\n(2) The main technical body of the paper is mostly a listing of theorems. I did not find any proofs or intuitions about how the theorems are proved; and I do not know how technically difficult or interesting the theorems are. On the positive side, sometimes these theorems are followed by some examples of scenarios that meet the hypotheses of the theorems. However, at the end of the paper, I am not entirely sure where these results are relevant and whether they are difficult to obtain. (Once again, I don't work specifically in this area, but I have some familiarity with the general area of TML+economics and computation and these flavors of results.)\n",

It is unclear from the paper, whether the two-timescale algorithm is novel. I am not familiar enough with the area to extrapolate.\n\nEDIT: After further discussion with the committee, author responses, my own study etc., I am more convinced of the novelty of the results in this paper. I am increasing my rating of this paper to above the acceptance threshold.\n\nI felt that the motivation of the introduction and motivation of the paper could have been more clearly presented. The introduction talked about the general importance of understanding games, iteration dynamics, and asynchronicty, but I'm not sure why this *particular* problem is of interest.\n\n",
