This paper thinks the FSS feature extractor deserves exploration and observe the heterogeneity (i.e., the intra-class diversity in the raw images) as a critical challenge hindering the intra-class feature compactness. In this paper, aothors propose Multi-level Heterogeneity Suppressing (MuHS), which utilizes novel cross sample attention, cross-region interaction and masked image segmentation to suppress the heterogeneity from three levels.\n",

Experimental results confirm that MuHS is compatible to multiple FSS heads and achieves new state of the art using a simple linear classification head.\n\nWeaknesses\uff1a\nInstead of designing a special classification header based on such a powerful feature extractor, a simple linear classification header is used.\n",

The improvement is a bit incremental, although I do acknowledge the contribution of three components to few-shot segmentation. The main contribution is the application of some tricks in the few-shot segmentation task, which is an empirical advancement and the theoretical novelty is limited.\n2. Although the paper has provided extensive evaluations over different metrics and datasets, some details of the experiment setup and results are not fairly convincing. For example, the setting of ablation studies is not appropriate, because an ablation study typically refers to removing some \u201cfeature\u201d of the model or algorithm, and seeing how that affects performance. The results of ablation studies are not enough to validate the efficiency of the proposed components. ",
