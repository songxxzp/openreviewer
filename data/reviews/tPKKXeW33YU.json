However, in practice, such ideal reconstruction is rarely happens especially for sparse input setting. The proposed method is evaluated using only synthetic data which also raise a concern about the robustness of the proposed method when it is applied to real world scenarios. How does the proposed method avoid overfitting when the training and testing are both under ideal configurations? The proposed method is only compared with kNN and MLP which are very simple baseline methods.

WiNeRT is a hybrid heuristic/learned ray tracer that replaces some heuristic ray tracing functionality, especially the Ray-Surface Interaction with a neural network. The authors claim that this is the first wireless neural ray tracer and in addition to simulating ray-tracing results, it will allow solving inverse problems via differentiating through the model. The paper experimentally validates the accuracy of the model against simple baselines and shows initial results on inverse problem of localization.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n\u2014-------------------\n\nThe paper has many strengths and is tackling an important problem. For the sake of time  I am only writing about weaknesses in this review, since those are the ones that should be actioned upon.\n\nWeaknesses (and questions) (W)\n\n\u2014--------------------------------------------\n\nW: The method is a hybrid method that utilizes both typical ray tracing and neural ray marching features. It would be good if the authors could write more precisely which parts of the algorithm are same/similar as normal full ray-tracing and which parts contain learned functions. As far as I understand the main learned part is the Ray-Surface Interaction, and it would be important to describe how this is normally done to understand what the neural surrogate is approximating.\n\nW: Give more details on the end-to-end model, e.g., in an appendix for reproducibility. As it stands it might be difficult to re-implement or improve the current method.\n\nW: The authors should describe more clearly what are the target use cases for the system. It seems to be that the system requires training data from the same/similar environment from an existing ray tracer, so what would be the biggest reasons for using the neural surrogate since an existing ray tracing simulation is anyway needed?\n\nW: The main reason (in addition to inverting) of using a neural surrogate is to improve the inference time simulation speed and computational complexity. As far as I can see this discussion is missing from the paper and it would be very important to discuss it.\n\nW: (See above). If the computational complexity is not reduced much, then the main benefit of the model is the invertibility, which is briefly discussed in the localization experiment. How good is the localization result? It should be compared to other localization approaches in the same environment (without using the trained model). In addition, it would be important to discuss more use cases of the model inversion and more inversion experiments of the neural surrogate should be performed.\n\nW: The paper might find a relatively narrow audience in machine learning and might be even more suitable for publishing in the wireless domain. For ICLR, the authors should discuss which parts could be generalizable to other domains than wireless ray tracing.\n\nW: While there are extensive tests of generalization in the same space as in training (different Rx and Tx locations, etc.), the generalization to new spaces would be interesting to study further in addition to F\u2032 in Figure A3. It will be important to see also the failure cases where there is a big enough change in the environment in the test set, ie., how general ray tracing algorithm it has learned.\n\nW: The authors do not discuss non-linear effects of the channel, such as doppler shift or spread and how this could be modeled for highly mobile UEs.\n\nW: The baselines 1-NN and MLP should be described more carefully. Are they replacing the ray-marching part or the general processing. What parts of a normal ray-tracer are the baselines utilizing (different from the main model)\n\nW: How is diffraction handled in the model?\n\nW: How is penetration handled in the model?\n\nW: Regarding inverse problems, could the authors state which kinds of inverse problems would be solvable using the model and which would lie outside of the current model. For example, could one design changes in the environment geometry using the current model or is it currently restricted only to the trained geometry.\n",
