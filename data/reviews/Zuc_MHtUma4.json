            "summary_of_the_paper": "Authors propose a novel technique to compute weak optimal transport plan between two distributions, given in possibly two different spaces. Based on an earlier work of Gozlan et al, the computation of OT plan is formulated as a certain minimax task. The major issue that the paper addresses is that some saddle points of the latter task can correspond to fake plans. Existence of fake plans is proven theoretically and demonstrated on toy experiments.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "First, it looks like existence of fake plans is a result of some kind of degeneracy in the problem formulation\u00a0(like the multicollinearity problem in linear regression). Can it be tackled by some form of regularization? Interesting question was asked on page 6: \"Should we really care about solutions being fake?\" and noted that \"the map T may fluctuate between fake solutions rather than converge.\" The question is: does it fluctuate between fake solutions, or, in fact, it fluctuates as some convex combination of stochastic OT plans? The Proposition 2 hints that it could be the second case.\u00a0\nAnother issue is that existence of fake plans are demonstrated on toy experiments. A natural question is: are fake plans common when the technique is applied to real-world data, e.g. to unpaired image-to-image translation task?\n\nMinor comments:\nPage 1: (a) Celeba (female) \u2192 shoes  ->   (a) Celeba (female) \u2192 anime  \nPage 2:  fomulations ->  formulations  \nPage 8: under perform -> underperform",

The math is clear and appropriate. Proofs are thorough, complete, and in my checking correct.\n- The theoretical results are accompanied by detailed simulations. \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The claimed limitations of weak costs were not detailed as comprehensively as I would have liked. Specifically, how far off are the \"fake\" plans? Also, how bad is the instability? These seem like important points, given that they motivate the paper in the first place. \n- I found the exposition difficult. The introduction is quite short, has jargon that is not explained, and hence doesn't completely set up the problem. After reading the paper through, I appreciate the contribution but it think it would help to try to get more of the details earlier in the paper. \n- There are a large number of figures with image to image translation. I don't see what the unique contribution is for each. It seems like one would suffice in the main text. \n\nOther detailed comments\n- I didn't really understand what figure 1 was supposed to show. How would I know if the result is \"good\"? \n- Please define strong and weak transport costs in the introduction. What is the significance of the difference aside from the fact that people use them? \n- Please define fake solutions. It would be helpful to be specific here so readers understand the gravity of the situation. \n- Please define a weak kernel cost when one uses it the first time. \n- It is not clear why imagine to image translation is a good way of testing performance. \n- \"may be not an optimal stochastic map. In this paper, we show that for the \u03b3-weak quadratic cost (3) this may be problematic: the arg infT sets might contain fake\nsolutions T\" I don't quite understand whether this is the same point, i.e. it is problematic because it is not an optimal stochastic map, or whether there are other aspects that are problematic. If it is problematic because it is not an optimal stochastic map, and the fake solutions are of this type, it would help to use simpler language (fewer different names) and adopt a label more descriptive than \"fake solutions\". \n- I appreciated the inclusion of a derivation of (9) in the appendix. \n- \"Should we really care about solutions being fake?\" It would be great for the answer to this question to appear early in the paper. \n- It would be nice to have some sense of how bad fake solutions are. Are these truly pathological? (In the sense of being far from Q?) Also, can we demonstrate the stability issues more concretely? \n- I don't see the added value of having the example figures in the paper (beyond the first one). ",
