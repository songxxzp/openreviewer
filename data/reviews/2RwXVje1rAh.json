The main problem addressed in this paper is how to design a proper criterion for cost-efficient sample acquisition. In this work, the authors jointly investigate three novel criteria in the framework CRB for point cloud acquisition (label conciseness, feature representativeness and geometric balance) which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D bounding box labels. \n\nIn particular, (1)To alleviate the issues of label redundancy and class imbalance, the entropy of bounding box label predictions are used to pick top *K*1 point clouds. (2)Monte Carlo dropout and the hypothetical labels by averaging predictions from multiple stochastic forward passes are used for considering the impact of classification and regression objectives on gradients. (3) Finally, to maintain the *geometric balance* property, we minimize the KL divergence between the marginal distributions of point cloud density of each predicted bounding box. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper explores how activate learning can help reduce annotation costs in the field of object detection of 3D point clouds. Specifically, to achieve efficient active learning with limited fixed annotation budgets, three selection criteria termed CRB are proposed to learn better sample acquisition of the 3D boxes annotation. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical active learning scheme in active learning for 3D object detection.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "### Srength: \n- Activate learning in point cloud object detection is interesting and novel. I believe this paper can provide insights and inspiration to the related works in the 3D object detection area.\n\n- The theoretical analysis is sufficient and helpful to understand the method, and also provide support for the final performance validation.\n\n- The experiments are extensive and can validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\n\n### Weaknesses: \n- I would suggest the authors clearly clarify the major difference of the paper with existing works on object detection and point clouds processing. It seems that this paper is analyzed in an general optimized view, but it will be better if the author can explicitly illusrate the innovation and the fundamental difference with exisiting techniques.\n\n- For related work, I would suggest that the author add literature on 2D Detection and some of the latest works in 3D point cloud detectors. Just name a few: \n\n\t1. QBox: Partial Transfer Learning With Active Querying for Object Detection [2021, TNNLS]\n\t2. Towards Dynamic and Scalable Active Learning with Neural Architecture Adaption for Object Detection [2021, BMVC]: Add NAS into the AL loops.\n\t3. Entropy-based Active Learning for Object Detection with Progressive Diversity Constraint [2022, CVPR]\n\t4. Weakly Supervised Object Detection Based on Active Learning [2022, NPL]\n\t5. Active Learning Strategies for Weakly-Supervised Object Detection [2022]\n\t6. Label-Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation: An Active Learning Approach [2021, CVPR]\n\t7. ReDAL: Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation [2021, ICCV]\n\t8. Active Learning for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation via Spatial-Structural Diversity Reasoning [2022]\n\n- As for the experimental results in Table 1, it is a little bit counterintuitive: the proposed CRB with 1% labels can perform better than the general full-label training model. In my view, the active learning methods can achieve the performance very close to the full-label training model. The authors are suggested to explicitly clarify why the performance is even better than fully supervised model.\n\n-More experiments on various detectors (e.g., SECOND, PV-RCNN) are required to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria for general active 3D object detection. Additionally, indoor scenarios such as ScanNet should also be taken into consideration.",

The las thet part favors point clouds with similar object point density as of the labelled set. Empirical studies showed the proposed three components are mostly effective and out-perform existing active learning methods on some datasets.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n1. The authors gave a good summary of existing active learning methods for LiDAR object detection, which highlighted the significance and popularity of the problem under study.\n2. The authors developed an active-3D-det toolbox which could be quite helpful for setting fair and rigorous baselines for future researches.\n3. Experiments on KITTI showed promising results.\n\nCons:\n1. There are quite some factual errors in the method part of this work.\n    1. PointNet series did not encode free-point cloud into a 3D tensor. On the bottom of Page 2, \u201cMainstream 3D object detectors encode free-form point clouds P into a regular feature map x \u2208 R W \u00b7L\u00b7F directly (Qi et al., 2017) or by voxelization (Shi et al., 2020), with W, L, F representing width, length, and channels of the feature map.\u201d \n    2. Wrong assumptions about loss function. The authors assumed that \u201cThe loss functions for classification and regression are assumed to be Lipschitz continuous\u201d, but a simple binary cross entropy loss is not Lipschitz continuous for p in (0, beta]. Also I failed to connect the Lipschitz continuous of loss function with anything in Section 2.2.\n2. Section 2.2 is quite vague to me, I don\u2019t how Theorm 2.1 is connected to Eq 1 and what are Ps in Eq 1\n3. A uniform prior of target labels as assumed in Eq. 2 is too far from the observed reality in LiDAR object detection \n4. Stage 2 in section 2.3 is quite hard to understand. Each step in Eq. 7 seems too big a leap for me and proper discussion are not made in the text part.\n5. Only the KITTI experiments showed promising results. For the Waymo experiments in Figure 2, CRB is out-performed by LLAL and ENTROPY in the low data regime while almost on par with RAND baseline in the high data regime. I find there are implementations for other datasets like nuScenes and Lyft in the supplementary codes, which makes me wonder if the method generalizes well across different datasets.",
