            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. Strictly proper scoring rules are important for both training and evaluation in survival analysis. Due to the existence of censoring, strictly proper scoring rules are hard to find. The common training objectives are usually not strictly proper. The authors tackle this difficulty and propose four new extensions of existing objectives. \n\n2. The authors also propose another evaluation metric for calibration based on the KL-divergence between Kaplan-Meier estimator and the proposed estimation. \n\nWeakness:\n1. The authors propose four strictly proper scoring rules under the condition parameters w are correct. However, unless we know the true distribution. But the true distribution is never known. So the authors need to discuss how hard we can get w in practice. And if we cannot get the w correctly, is using wrongly estimated w based \"strictly proper scoring rule\" still better than using those non-strictly proper ones?\n\n2. In experiments, the authors only compare four new objectives. The authors have not compare with training with the non-proper version of the proposed algorithm. To make the things easier to compare with, the authors can use synthetic distributions, in which they can get the true distribution/true parameters w in the objectives, and the authors test the performance using the strictly proper scoring without estimation loss from w. The authors should also include some common training objectives, for example, likelihood during the comparison.\n\n3. The authors should consider some other common evaluation metrics, for example, concordance. Though concordance is not a proper scoring rule, but it has a practical meaning in survival analysis, i.e., the patient with high risk should be estimated with high risk. This is helpful when allocating medical resources. \n\n4. Closely related to the first point. Are the proposed objectives really helpful in training deep models? Deep models may not find the global optima in optimization. Finding good local optima is more important. So are \"strictly proper scoring rules\" really an important point? Will non-proper rule be better for optimization. The authors do not need to answer this in details. This is a hard topic.\n\n\nMinor:\n1. In introduction, bullet point Brier score, \"show that neither of them are not proper in terms of the theory of scoring rules.\" I think the authors may want only one negation here. maybe remove \"not\".\n2. I think when the authors define four new objectives, they probably need to define with the expectation. For example, the expectation of the Portnoy\u2019s estimator is strictly proper but not the estimator itself.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studies how to use proper scoring rules to solve the survival analysis problem, where we want to estimate the distribution F(t) of a random variable T using possibly censored data, which are samples of Z = min{T, C} and whether Z = T or C. While any proper scoring rule can be used as a loss function to train a model (e.g., a neural network) to estimate a distribution using uncensored data, to train on censored data the original proper scoring rule needs to be adapted. The authors adapt four proper scoring rules (Pinball, Logarithmic, Brier, and Ranked Probability Score), and theoretically prove that these adapted socring rules are proper, under the assumption that a parameter w (that depends on the distribution F(t)) is known.\n\nIn practice, however, the parameter w is unknown, so the authors use EM and CQRNN algorithms to choose w and train the model together. Experiments show that the adapted logarithmic scoring rule is the best.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "[Strength]\n\nSurvival analysis is definitely an important problem to study, and the use of proper scoring rules to solve this problem is also well motivated. The authors prove that the proper scoring rules adapted to the survival problem are proper under some condition. This is an interesting result.\n\n[Weakness]\n\nHowever, I can't really tell the novelty of this work. Just as the authors mention, many works like (Portnoy, 2003), (Pearce et al, 2022) already proposed to use proper scoring rules to solve the survival analysis problem. Although the authors claim to be the first to prove that Portnoy's estimator (which is adapted from Pinball loss) is proper, this conclusion is under the strong assumption that the parameter w (which depends on the unknown distribution F(t)) is known. Under this assumption, the conclusion that Portnoy's estimator (and other three adapted scores) is proper is not surprising. It seems to me that the most challenging part of using scoring rules to solve survival analysis is how to estimate the parameter w, instead of proving properness. The methods to estimate w in this paper, however, basically follow from previous works.\n\nThe relationship with previous works is unclear. Introduction says that Rindt et al (2022) show that variants of Brier score and ranked probability score are not proper, but the variants in this paper are claimed to be proper (if w is known). Are they different variants? Also, did Portnoy (2003) or Pearce et al (2022) already prove that Portnoy's estimator is proper if we know w?\n\n\n[Feedback, not weakness]\n\nIt might help to include some results in Appendix B (additional experiments) in the body, in particular, the comparison between the proper scoring rules in this paper and the custom loss functions in other state-of-the-art neural networks. One motivation for the authors to study properness of scoring rules in the survival analysis problem is because the scoring rules are used as loss functions in training neural networks, where properness is desired. So, the empirical comparison between proper scoring rules and other custom loss functions is worth including.",

Assumption 3.1: What is feature X? Does X affect the distribution of T? Namely, is the CDF of T still equal to F(t) after conditioning on X? (I think it is, according to your proof of Theorem 4.5). Also, does X affect the distribution of C? If X does not affect the distributions of T and C then why do you define X?\n  \n4.
