First, the paper designs and presents three benchmark domains to explore the limits of modern MARL algorithms in terms of their ability to handle environment heterogeneity and the need to actually cooperate (rather than independently acting to complete the team's task). Second, the paper develops a new algorithm for MARL specifically designed for heterogeneity and cooperation. The paper evaluates their approach against baseline methods in the new benchmark domains, presenting numerous, positive results.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n-This paper clearly states its contributions on Page 3 (and in the abstract).\n-Unlike many papers in MARL, this paper contributes not only an algorithm but also a set of MARL environments that push MARL algorithms' ability to handle environment heterogeneity and test the need of these algorithms to truly coordinate.\n-The domains presented (TeamTgoether, TeamSupport and KeyForTreasure) are intuitive and do, indeed, appear to require coordination (unlike some MARL domains). Though, it is important to note that these are not the only domains that *benefit* from coordination (e.g., Predator-Prey [1]). \n-The paper shows positive results for SAF vs. MAPPO and IPPO on the proposed benchmark environments while varying the degree of coordination (Figure 3) and heterogeneity (Figure 4).\n-The paper also provides generally positive (but somewhat mixed results) for out-of-distribution generalization (Figure 5).\n-The breadth and depth of the empirical results in this paper (not including the appendices) is impressive.\n\nWeaknesses:\n-The paper could be improved with a DEC-POMDP setup formalism to help explain the terminology/line-of-inquiry.\n-The description of the Stateful Active Facilitator (SAF) is relatively short. While more details are in the appendix, it would be helpful if pseudocode was provided (Algorithm 1) in the main paper. Figure 2 does not help much in describing the approach and could be removed to make room for a better illustration or more text-based details. Many approaches work by generating and integrating messages -- how does this approach really differ? The technical uniqueness is unclear here in the algorithmic formulation. The selection of predefined(?) policies appears unique, but details are missing about how these policies are enumerated and trained.\n-The paper is missing important baselines in the MARL literature, including [2], [3], [4], and [5]\n\n[1] Singh, A., Jain, T. and Sukhbaatar, S., 2018.

The authors are commended for developing a set of three new environments to test the efficacy of MARL algorithms along dimensions of heterogeneity and cooperation in terms of the environment. The authors are also commended for additionally developing a new MARL approach. However, doing both in one paper means that a significant amount of detail is left to appendices/supplementary detail. As such, it is difficult to fully understand the details of the technical approach. I would recommend either figuring out a way to move some of the ablation studies (and/or Figure 2) to the appendix and instead moving more details about the algorithm and its motivation/intuition and psuedocode to the main paper.\n\nThe novelty is clear in terms of a new set of domains, but the novelty w.r.t.

Why would different agents have different transition functions (designed as the change of action order)?

The designed environments seem to focus more on the coordination level while the designed algorithm (dynamically selects model) seems to focus on the hetergeneous property.\n- From the evaluation result, it seems the designed solution performs better for different hetergeneous environments, but has less improvement when the coordination level is higher.

If not, why? It has been shown in several studies that parameter sharing significantly improves the achieved returns of cooperative MARL with homogeneous agents.\n- The paper claims that one of its main contributions is HECOGrid, a suite of MARL environments. However, the authors have not included the source code of HECOGrid.\n- While state/observation heterogeneity is a feature currently missing from many MARL environments, I believe that agent heterogeneity is a more interesting and fundamental challenge (for the MARL community).\n- It seems like some IPPO results are missing from Figure 4.\n- Most of the experiments are performed for coordination level 1, which means that only a single agent is required to solve the task. That primarily shows that SAF does not \"enables agents to work efficiently in high-coordination and high-heterogeneity environments\". It seems that the main benefits of SAF come from the centralized computation of the value function. Can the authors elaborate more on why they believe that SAF outperforms the related baselines?\n- In Figure 6, what do KS, and KS-PP mean? Does KS mean SAF without PP? What is KS-PP? Is it just SAF? Or is it SAF without KS? If this is the case, how much is the contribution of KS to SAF?\n- I would expect to see more clarifications on why SAF is better compared to baselines.
