            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strength:\n- The paper proposes an interesting method to augment dataset, it achieave good performance compared with other augmentation method.\n- It demonstrated that EDA and BT methods are harmful  on CDN datasets.\n\n## Weakness:\n- It would be nice if the authors could basically check how many ratios of  wrong labels brought by the proposed DA and existing one, either using expert annotation  or automatic evaluation. This could be tested by using only a few examples.\n\n- There are no details about how many augmented examples used for baseline DA methods including EDA and BT. This should be carefully compared for a fair comparison.\n\n- Only a small-scaled Chinese dataset was used. It would be better if the authors could evidences their method across many datasets\n\n- The task is only for Chinese language, making it too narrow to fit ICLR.\n\n- The authors should detail the motivaiton to use EDA and BT as the baselines. Since there are many other  DA methods in NLP, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01852 \n\n\n\n\n## minor issue:\n- The font and the reference format seems wrong",

From my understanding, some of the DA methods are specific to Chinese language, right? If yes, this should be clearly stated. Otherwise English disease normalization dataset should be considered.\n\n- Do you think it is more challenging for Chinese language than English to deal with  disease normalization dataset?  If so, please illustrate a little bit morel,\n",

However, although this task is extensively studied, also in Chinese, the paper did not seem to properly acknowledge and appreciate this prior work. To illustrate, its first two sections (Introduction and Background) did not use peer-reviewed publications to support its argumentation (in total, one paper (arXiv preprint from 2019) was cited in the entire first section and none of the related literature was cited in the second section) and this problem of insufficient positioning of this paper in the prior work was also evident in the last section (Conclusion) of the paper; no discussion section or paragraph to position the contributions of this paper compared to the prior work was included here to close the study. Finally, the third section (Related Work) was hard to understand because the scope of the included studies was not communicated; I would have wanted to learn if, for example, the included papers were targeting or at least applicable to medical natural language processing in Chinese. Consequently, the novelty and clarity of the study - or minimally their clear and convincing argumentation - can be questioned.\n\nGiven the societal importance of medical natural language processing, I would have expected to see a broader impact statement in this paper. Also, although the CHIP-CDN - Chinese disease normalization dataset used in this study seems to have been collected and released before, the authors should have discussed relevant ethical considerations, minimally describing how the authors analyzed and evaluated that the dataset was created ethically and that their use of its for the purposes of this study was ethical.\n\nUnfortunately, the paper was formatted using an incorrect template; it did not look like ICLR 2023 papers and hence, should be desk rejected.

The authors have mentioned the work of Falis et al [2022] and Abdollahi et al [2021] for data augmentation using UMLS but have not compared their methodologies for data augmentation.\n3. The information regarding the NER tool are completely missing from the paper. On which data was the NER model from section 4.1 trained and what was its performance? Since the performance of the framework heavily depends on the model as well. \n4. Is there a validity study done to see if the axis rotation method would not create diseases which are not anatomically or medically correct or significant?\n5. Section 4.2 needs some more details regarding the training procedure. Were the experiments done using multiple seeds? If yes, could you please share the average and std for the results? \n6. Details in Section 5.2 are confusing. Para 2 of the section mentions accuracy as the evaluation metric but also mentions that F1-score was used for evaluation according to the previous work. Also, was macro or micro F1-score used for evaluation? \n7. Table 1 mentioned that the result is of devset accuracy. Are all the experiments performed on devset? And is the testset accuracy or F1-score not reported?\n\n-------------------------------------\nRecommendation to the authors\n-------------------------------------\nI believe that the work is important and necessary but I would also like to add that it would be much more suitable for a clinically oriented workshop or conference such as ML4H, MLHC, LOUHI, BioNLP or clinicalNLP. \n",
