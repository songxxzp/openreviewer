            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper introduces a new problem setting that learns the geometric eigen-lengths for robot fitting tasks. The authors build a benchmark for this task, propose two learning methods (learning directly from binary supervision and learning with geometric primitive), and test the methods with single-task and multi-task(transfer learning) settings.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "###### Pros\n- The idea of learning task-specific geometry lengths of the object and the environment is interesting.\n- This paper is written clearly, with the motivation and methodology easy to follow.\n- The authors build a comprehensive benchmark suite including 6 kinds of tasks, ~1200 object models from ShapeNet, the corresponding datasets, and evaluation metrics.\n- The findings of being able to learn length directly from binary supervision are interesting and impressive.\n\n###### Cons\n- To apply the eigen-length learning step to robot fitting or other robot manipulation problems, it seems that how to choose and define the geometric primitive and the creteria is essential to this problem. After that step, parameter learning is relatively easy. Therefore, whether the proposed problem setting and method are practical remains unclear. This method design is contrary to the goal of the paper, which aims to rely on the least human prior. \n- To predict geometric information, there are tons of ways, including traditional image processing methods like edge detection, deep learning methods over computer vision like 3D object detection[1], segmentation[2], 6 DoF pose estimation[3] and computer stereo vision system[4] with necessary pre-process and post-process operations. The proposed method for the robot fitting task is one of the extended applications of the geometric information prediction problem, and thus the novelty is limited.\n- There are no experimental comparisons to baselines. For example, other robot fitting methods (or simpler, binary-classification methods) that explicitly estimate or implicitly learn the geometric information should be compared; Comparisons of the low-dimensional eigen-length to the high-dimensional latent codes and structured representations discussed in the Introduction section should also be empirically verified.\n- The constraints of the problem setting, i.e., only translation (without rotation) of pre-aligned objects and environments is too strict to be feasible in practice.\n- For Table 2, should the proposed method be compared with other transfer learning methods instead of direct training without knowing the training tasks?\n\n\n###### Refs\n- [1] Zhou, Yin, and Oncel Tuzel. \"Voxelnet: End-to-end learning for point cloud based 3d object detection.\" Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2018.\n- [2] Wu, Bichen, et al. \"Squeezeseg: Convolutional neural nets with recurrent crf for real-time road-object segmentation from 3d lidar point cloud.\" 2018 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA).

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper explores an under-investigated problem, that of automatically discovering geometric quantities that indicate the potential success or failure of fitting tasks. These include passing an object through a tube-like container, putting an object in a drawer or a sphere, etc. The authors use the term eigen-lengths for these measurements and explore three approaches for learning them from data, with the help of some manual annotation in the form of specifying the number of relevant eigen-lengths. Several tasks accompanied with relevant data are defined and quantitative results are presented. (Presumably, the data and test suite will be released if the paper is accepted.)",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of this paper is difficult because the problem addressed is under-explored in the literature and the solutions presented here are not mature yet. This seems to be an interesting direction for research, but there are several shortcuts and limitations in the formulation. While this is partially understandable, I have doubts whether this is the right direction and whether extensions of this formulation are likely to be adopted by other researchers.\n\nStrengths\n\nThis is an interesting problem and a thought-provoking paper presenting a novel take on it.\n\nThe claim that the eigen-lengths are interpretable and universal is true, but also self-evident. Determining if an object fits in different objects depends on it dimensions. I do not consider this a major strength.\n\nThe concept of grounding, as defined in the paper, leads to improved performance. \n\nThe comparison of the direct, implicit and grounded methods is informative, but see below about my concerns on the representation.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe restriction of object motion to translation only appears reasonable for a first attempt at the proposed formulation, but reduces the search for \u201ceigen\u201d lengths to essentially the selection of relevant dimensions of the bounding box. Since both objects and containers/tubes are axis-aligned, the problem is greatly simplified and does not require the learning of affordances other than the concept of support surfaces in some cases. (It is not clear to me if points of contact are detected in the sphere fitting task, for example.)\n\nSuccess or failure of a given task is determined based on the existence of suitable final placement of the object in the environment. In some cases of interest, the existence of a feasible trajectory is also needed. An object may fit in a cabinet or drawer but there may be no way to put it in there.\n\nThe fact that the number of relevant eigen-lengths, S, has to be set manually is a limitation. \n\nThe chosen representation of the objects and environments requires further justification. PointNet descriptors are not well suited for capturing object properties such as dimensions. It seems that some other representation, possibly in the form of random projections, would be more effective.\n\nSection 6.1 is hard to connect to a practical scenario. (It is possible that I am missing something.)\n\nThe test set in Table 4 is dominated by jars. I do not see any reason to construct an imbalanced dataset for an unexplored problem.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The concepts are presented clearly, but sometimes at a level that is too abstract.\n\nFailure cases and limitations are discussed in the supplement.\n\nThe work is original, to the best of my knowledge.\nReproducing the methods based on the descriptions in the main text and supplement is not an easy task. The use of PointNets for classification and segmentation is briefly mentioned without many other details.\n\nMinor Comment: No publication venues are provided for both papers by Higgins et al. \n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "On one hand, accepting the paper may inspire other researchers to make progress on an interesting problem, surpassing the baseline algorithms presented here. On the other hand, some of the limitations listed above are serious. I recommend borderline accept for now to give the benefit of the doubt to the authors, but justification for the chosen representations, the use of PointNet, and the restriction to translation-only motion should be provided in the rebuttal. Section 6 should be explained more clearly.\n\n++++++++++++ Dec. 11 update ++++++++++++++++++\n\nAfter the discussion among the reviewers and area chair and the latest author responses, I am leaning towards recommending rejection. Even though the idea is interesting, I had undervalued the limitations, which outweigh the contributions. The handling of rotation in particular is unsatisfactory. According to the authors\u2019 latest response, rotations in rectangular environments cannot be handled. This is an important limitation. I also do not understand the value of rotating spheres or sphere-shaped environments when the representation is purely geometric. Moreover, the response on the ordering of eigen-lengths so that they correspond across the object and environment is unsatisfactory. I do not see how the network can learn that based on the loss function.",
