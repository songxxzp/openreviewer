            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper proposes an uncertainty & temporal distance-aware curriculum goal-generation method for various navigation tasks and a manipulation task. Uncertainty quantification is based on a Bayesian classifier obtained via conditional normalized maximum likelihood (Zhou & Levine, 2021; Li et al., 2021), which guides the curriculum into unexplored regions. The temporal distance is represented using a Wasserstein distance with a time-step metric (Durugkar et al., 2021b) to provide intrinsic reward and query the frontier of the explored region. The proposed method is compared against a variety of existing approaches. ",

These properties are empirically verified by experiments. \n* The method provides a novel bipartite-matching-based algorithm as an instantiation of the goal sampling process. \n* It is empirically demonstrated that the proposed method achieves better asymptotic performance and sample efficiency compared to prior methods. \n\nWeaknesses\n* On Spiral-Maze and Ant Locomotion environments, none of the baseline methods are able to have non-zero success rate. The paper does not offer an explanation what part of the proposed algorithm results in such performance discrepancy. Is the discrepancy caused by particular attributes of the environments, and are these attributes taken care of by specific components of the proposed method? A further ablation study of the method design on these environments would provide more intuition. \n\nClarification questions\n* In Figure 3, HGG has its final curriculum centered in a region which is far from the designed goal for U-Maze, while still having a good performance. Why is it the case? ",

The core idea is to find states at the frontier that are similar to the specified goals. The proposed method keeps track of exploration frontiers using a notion of temporal distance and computes state similarity using an estimated wasserstein distance. Experiments in simulated control tasks show the proposed method outperform baselines.\n\n",

The language used is not formal and at the same time not easy to understand with grammatical errors. \n-A lot of the technical details are missing from the main text and deferred to the appendix or reference work, which makes understanding the technical contents really difficult. For example, how did you make the CNML estimation tractable? How long or how much longer does the proposed method require compared with baseline methods? How much did the meta learning part help?\n-I also have a hard time understanding what the hyperparameter c represents (how does it adjust the preference?) and how bipartite matching actually applies here. A diagram/visual of different moving parts of the algorithm would be super helpful.\n-More explanation and analysis of the results could be very useful for understanding the performance of the proposed method. In figure5, it seems a lot of baseline data are missing in many task domains but it is unclear whether there is no data or the success rates are zeros for all of them?\n",

Some of the descriptions can be confusing and hard to access.\nThe presentation of both the method and results can also be improved.
