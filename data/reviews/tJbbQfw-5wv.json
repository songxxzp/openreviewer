However, the datasets currently used for evaluating the various models could have potential biases and issues. This paper identifies one such issues with these datasets and finds that mitigating the issue causes several SoTA models for heterophily to do poorly. The paper then goes ahead and creates new heterophilic datasets which have wider variety in terms of domains, sizes and heterophily. The paper shows that simple modifications of GAT architecture on these datasets work better than most of the SoTA models for heterophily.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "# Strengths:\n1. The paper is clearly written and easy to follow.\n2. The raised issue of duplicates is very interesting.\n3. The reported results significant gap in performance.\n4. The new datasets presented show wide variety in domain, size, heterophily and class balance.\n***\n# Weaknesses:\n1. There is no reported statistics on the filtered graphs. \n2. GPRGNN can be reduced to SGCN model [A]. Typically SGCN model is quite close in performance to GCN. Also, note that for homophilic datasets, GPRGNN results are on par with GCN. Additionally, GPRGNN was also evaluated on synthetic benchmarks built from stochastic block models which are not likely to have the duplicate issue. It showed good performance even on those. All of this suggests that GPRGNN model should be at least as competitive as GCN on any dataset. So, it is quite odd that GCN gets 40.70% on filtered squirrel whereas GPRGNN is at 33.57%. Similar issues are present in results reported for the new datasets. This makes the reported numbers less believable.\n3. The paper does not report whether there are duplicate issues in the new datasets.\n4. The wiki-cooc dataset already report pretty high numbers. Despite having low homophily, GCN numbers are already pretty high suggesting quite possibly strong node features. So, the value of the dataset is somewhat unclear. Same with minesweeper dataset.\n***\n# References:\n[A] Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks, Felix Wu, Tianyi Zhang, Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr., Christopher Fifty, Tao Yu, Kilian Q. Weinberger, ICML 2019.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is easy to follow, but there are several things that need clarification:\n1. How connected is the filtered graph? \n2. Do all the duplicate node also have the same label?\n3. What fraction of the duplicates are present in train, val and test? If you take the original graph and run any of the models, then split the test set into duplicate nodes and non-duplicate nodes, and measure performance independently, what is the performance split that you obtain? The paper claims memorization as the possible cause of degradation, it will be good to verify this. \n4. Is the filtered graph directed or undirected? If directed, is it converted into undirected graph before using in these models? These models cannot handle directed graphs and making the graph symmetric using $A + A^T$ helps.\n5. How is the train/val/test created for the filtered graph? Do you create a fresh train, val, test split or simply remove the duplicate nodes from the previous train, val, test split?\n6. Are all the baseline models tuned for filtered graph or the previous parameters are utilized for measure the filtered graph performance? These models have sensitivity to hyper-parameter tuning, thus it is important to understand.\n7. Are there duplicates in the new dataset? If yes, what fraction?\n8. The wiki-cooc and minesweeper dataset already reports pretty high numbers for baseline model like GCN. Is there any way to quantify value of these datasets. For example, an upper bound on performance that might be achieved on these datasets? That will help understand the value of these datasets. Same can be done even for other datasets for uniformity.\n\nIf the above questions are clarified and If the reported numbers are properly verified and double checked, then the paper shows a very interesting finding and proposes several new interesting datasets on which newer model that can address heterophily can be built. This will be of great help to community. ",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, the paper two important points:\n\n1. The current heterophilic datasets have issue of duplication. And that current research using these dataset is flawed because of it. However, the numbers reported for various models are not quite believable. And it would be worthwhile to double check and verify the correctness of these numbers. Also, some more analysis on whether duplicates are present in large proportions in train and test and not only in large proportions but possibly skewed proportions. Any other analysis, in addition, would be helpful. If all of this leads to the claim that memorization is truly the cause of drop in performance, then the numbers might be more believable.\n\n2. The paper presents 5 new datasets. However, for two of these datasets, the numbers for base models like GCN are already pretty high. So, the value of these datasets for heterophilic graph neural network research is unclear.\n\nBased on these, I am inclined to mark this paper as marginally below acceptance threshold.",
