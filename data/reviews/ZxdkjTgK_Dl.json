            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a novel model named BSTT for sleep staging. BSST integrates the transformer and Bayesian relation inference to simultaneously model spatial-temporal relations and effectively capture the spatial-temporal features of the brain. Bayesian relation inference, the core component of BBST, comes in two forms, Bayesian temporal relation inference and Bayesian spatial relation inference and is proposed to infer spatial-temporal relations of brain during sleep in the service of capturing spatial-temporal relations. Experimental results show that BSTT achieves the state-of-the-art in multiple sleep staging datasets.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "*Strength\n\n- The problem of modeling temporal and spatial relations in an interpretable way for sleep staging is well motivated and explained.\n\n- This paper introduces the Bayesian relational inference in detail in terms of graphics, figures and formulas. How data and output flow are explained in the Bayesian relational inference step by step.\n\n- This paper compares some recently proposed baselines, and obtains the results of SOTA on two datasets, and the accuracy is improved by two percentage points.\n\n- The ablation experiments were valuable in demonstrating the impact of the proposed methods.\n\n\n*Weaknesses\n\n- The authors should add a pipline diagram so that readers can understand the overall process.\n\n- In the problem definition of preliminaries, the input data only reflects temporal information and doesn't very reflect spatial information. The problem defined is more like a regular time series problem, which is difficult to directly contact with the spatial-temporal relations emphasized above.\n\n- Some components used in the paper aren't introduced or cited in detail, such as the multi-head spatial Bayesian relation inference component.\n",

This paper considers the Bayesian spatial-temporal transformer to classify the sleep stage. The authors proposed the Bayesian transformer module to be applied to capture the spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG. Experiments with the other algorithms were conducted, showing better performance. Also, visual analysis shows the relationship between channels or previous stages. The interpretation is reasonable in the area of the sleep study.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\nThe performance is better than other algorithms, and the experiment is conducted compared with various algorithms. Also, the usage of the Bayesian transformer is interesting. This paper is strong in the application aspects.     \n\nCons:\nIn algorithm aspects, there are many issues. At first, the authors used the Bayesian transformer module. Many people know the transformer model, but some readers cannot be familiar with Bayesian transformers. It is better to add a more comprehensive explanation for the Bayesian transformer and the motivation for using this module. Next, there are some theoretical statements in the paper and Appendix. However, the organization of these materials is not well presented. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity: \nThe motivation is not clearly stated in the Bayesian transformer usage. Spatial and temporal modeling are combined, requiring more detailed explanations because there can be other approaches to combine spatial and temporal modeling, such as simple concatenation. Also, the connection of the theorem to vae should be clarified more thoroughly. Minor question: On page 8, what does \u201cfive-time slices are in the sleep period\u201d mean?        \n\nQuality:\nThe organization of this paper can be improved, especially in the algorithm parts. Also, in Appendix, the proof seems strange. In page 15, $(1- \\lambda) < (1- n \\lambda)$ should be explained. More editing is required to improve the paper.   \n\nNovelty and reproducibility:\nSomewhat novel. It seems that this paper is an application paper. Bu the applications seem successful. In the algorithm aspect, the novelty is degraded. Also, it seems that reproducibility can be possible. More repetition is required to validate the algorithms.    \n",
