As the authors note, there have been many machine learning methods developed for predicting antimicrobial resistance. The authors must compare against these approaches. \n\nOther comments: \n\nAs far as I can see, the \"baseline\" is not described anywhere. I assume that they used the same rule-based baseline as (Moradigaravand, 2018) \n\nThe authors cite a handful of AMR prediction methods but many are missing. For example, a Google Scholar search for \"machine learning predict antimicrobial resistance\" returns several reviews and papers not cited or compared against.\n\n",

The authors did a good job in explaining the importance of the application they are working on.\n- Developing/improving data-driven predictors for healthcare application is aspirational and important.\n\n### Weakness\n- Although I think this is an important application, I feel that this paper lacks any machine learning novelty to fit this conference. The paper is based on a simple implementation of transformer and train the model with standard multi-task approach. \n- The paper misses a lot of experimental results. It would be nice to (i) compare the model with other pre-existing approaches (rather than a simple \u201cBaseline\u201d method). It would also be good to see results that justify the proposed design choices (eg, ablation studies that explain why the model was design the way it was).\n- Finally, the model does not provide any novel biological insight provided by the proposed model.
