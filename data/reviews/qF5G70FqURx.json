Further explanations should be given on the reason why the CSE policy trained with low-quality offline expert data can produce higher-quality designs if possible.\n3. Typo in Figure 1.\n",

This idea can reduce the search space and is applied to tackle the decoupling capacitance placement problem. Specifically, this paper has devised a neural network model to generate the sequential placement action based on the existing placement state. The proposed approach is empirically compared against reinforcement learning RL or imitation learning (IL) baselines. The proposed approach shows better efficiency than baselines.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The major challenge for solving such placement problems is the combinatorial explosion.  The idea of applying solution symmetricity is interesting and can potentially reduce the problem difficulty significantly.\n2. The writing of this paper is good and the presentation is clear.\n3. The considered problem is theoretically formulated as an MDP so that the similar idea might be easily applicable to other scenarios.\n\nWeaknesses: \n1. In the decap placement problem considered here, the order of placement of each decap is not important, which is assumed in this paper. Whether the CSE idea is still applicable somehow if the order of placement of each element matters?\n2. The evaluation of the efficiency of the proposed method is somewhat quite sparse, only comparison with the AM-IL baseline. With these inadequate evaluations, it's not very convincing that how the proposed approach is more efficient than other baselines.\n3. The novelty of this paper mainly lies in the symmetricity exploitation. The design choices of the recurrent neural architecture are quite similar to typical architectures for tackling such placement problems.",

The proposed method is sound and has potential to be applied in industrial scenarios.

Since hardware design is multi-level and sequential and performance simulation is costly, data-efficient offline learning with good generalization becomes critical. This paper applies CSE to train a DPP solver using a limited number of offline expert data. Expoert exploitation induces symmetricity during the limited learning process and self-exploitation induces symmetricicty during the consistency learning process with self-generated data. ",

The proposed method can be very useful for that particular problem, but the generalization is questionable unless it can be evaluated on other tasks or domains. \n\n- The proposed method is not novel as policy gradient based reinforce and self-supervised learning are not new.

The reviewer understands that there are prior works getting traction by applying old techniques to a new domain (computer systems, circuit design, etc.), but those works did a great job promoting a new field of applications so that more and more researchers can build work on top of theirs. \n\nin order to improve this work, consider:\n- Promoting the application in this paper and make sure more people in this community are aware of it and would love to work on methods to improve the state-of-the-arts. \n\n- Be clear which parts are novel and which parts are compilation of existing work. If the proposed method is novel, be very specific in the introduction and abstract. \n\n- Create more thorough evaluation with more benchmarks and stronger baselines.
