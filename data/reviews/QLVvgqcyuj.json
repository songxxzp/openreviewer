Taking advantage of time series data, the authors use an auxiliary noise-free time series signal that is related to the target signal and a co-teaching-based approach for training DAEs. The proposed model can leverage the relationship between the auxiliary and target signals and does not get affected by not having a weak SNR. They show the benefit of their approach by using a real-world problem setup, i.e. blood glucose forecasting and control.",

I would have appreciated if the authors would have elaborated more on the usage of the auxiliary noise-free time series in the structure of the network (in both steps).\n2.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose an unsupervised denoising method for situations in the high noise regime with side information. They frame the problem for time-series applications, though the proposed method appears general. Their method is a variant of the Noise2Noise method (Lehtinen et al 2018), which itself builds off of Denoising Auto-encoders (Vincent et al 2008). They propose using dual independently initialized auto encoders to find subsets of the training set with low error on one encoder but not the other, assigning the remaining , which mark \"easy\" or nearly correct examples. They then learn using only these samples.\n\nThey present computational results on a ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n* The overall co-teaching DAE idea is novel and interesting, in my opinion.  \n* Experimental results are fully fleshed out, in that the baselines and upper bounds show many of the experimental conditions/ablations that I desired to see, e.g. a supervised case, a clean data upper bound, etc..  \n\nWeaknesses:\n* My major theoretical concern are cases where the hardness of differing samples under (stationary) Gaussian noise is not uniform. If the data domain is biased toward easy denoising in specific regions and hard problems in others, then it seems that this dual DAE scheme will not reconstruct the relatively harder regions where both DAEs fail, excluding them from the training set. While it is reasonable to ascribe this high error to high noise, it is also reasonable to ascribe this to the x domain also; this confounding seems unavoidable with the presented co-teaching scheme.  \n* The entire framing of the timeseries data (in the title, section 1, etc.) seems superfluous, except for the fact that the timeseries are used as side channel data. Is the additional empirical performance due to the fact that the proposed method is the only noise2noise method that includes the side-data? I think applying the NAC baseline to an expected y output would be a good experiment to test this proposition. It's not clear to me either way, but the entire side-channel/time-series context makes the rest of the analysis more complicated in my opinion.  ",

While it can be understood somewhat after reading the text, overall it is a missed opportunity to give the procedure the co-teaching scheme graphically. Instead, it mostly serves as a separate textbox. Second, the presentation of the same content of the text is dense. This is understandable given careful reading, but it is the most dense portion of the text where it should be the most lucid.\n\nOverall, this seems like a novel application of co-teaching, and seems simple enough to reproduce with the explicit exception dependence on the time-series/side-channel data.",

As the authors state in their paper, their work mostly shows that approaches which had already been shown to work with image data can also be applied to time series data. The real-world application of the paper, although compelling, is also very limited and not really feasible. As the authors themselves explain in the paper, their approach only works to de-noise data retrospectively and cannot work for real-time de-noising as presented in the paper. \nThe method itself also makes a number of strong assumptions that further limits its potential applicability.
