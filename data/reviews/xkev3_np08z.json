Extensive theoretical analyses show that ExpressivE is fully expressive and is capable of capturing various inference patterns. Experiments demonstrate that ExpressivE achieves competitive performance.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strength\n1. The idea of using hyper-parallelograms to design a new KGE model seems novel and interesting to me.\n2. The proposed model has many good properties and the authors provide rigorous theoretical proof for them.\n3. The model performs well while using only half the parameters compared with the previous state-of-the-art methods.\n4. The authors did a good job of introducing the background and related work.\n5. This paper is clearly written and well organized.\n\n## Weakness \n1. **Abstract**  \n    The authors claim that ExpressivE can capture prominent *logical rules* jointly. However, the term *logical rules* never appears again in the main text. So what does this claim mean?\n2. **Motivation**  \n    The main motivation of this work is to capture general composition and the authors claim that the ability to capture it is vital for KGE models to reason over graphs. However, is there any evidence to support this claim? I admit that it'd be better if a model can capture general composition, but there may not exist a strong connection between this ability and the final KGC performance.\n3. **Method**  \n    3.1 What does the term $\\mathbf{w}_i$ in Equation (3) stand for?    \n    3.2 The authors list some key properties of ExpressivE on Page 7, while there lacks necessary support for them. For example, the authors may want to give some graphic examples to show the intuitive geometric interpretation. Experimental results for 1-n, n-1, and n-n relations should be provided to support the third properties.\n4. **Experiments**  \n    4.1 I am confused about the worse performance of Base ExpressivE compared with Functional ExpressivE on FB15k-237. Even if FB15k-237 does not contain many hierarchy patterns, I expect that the base version of ExpressivE performs no worse than the functional one, since the width can be learned to be zero. Otherwise, the proposed method can only perform well on knowledge graphs with some special properties, which will significantly limit its applicability.    \n    4.2 It'd be better conduct experiments to show that ExpressivE can indeed model general composition, since it is the main contribution of this work.\n5. **Reproducibility**    \n    The authors claim that they have included the supplementary material via a link in an OpenReview comment. However, I cannot find the link.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "## Clarity\nThis paper is clearly written and well organized. The authors provide a sufficient background introduction and thus the paper is easy to follow.\n\n## Quality\nMost of the claims are well supported by either rigorous proofs or experimental results, while some needs more clarification. (See Strength And Weaknesses) I do not check the theoretical proof in the Appendix but they look nice.\n\n## Novelty\nThe idea of using hyper-parallelograms to design a geometric KGE model is mainly inspired by BoxE, but the way to realize it seems novel to me.\n\n## Reproducibility\nDetailed experimental settings are provided for reproducibility. However, the codes are not uploaded as the authors claimed.\n",
