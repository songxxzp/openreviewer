I am not sure the assumption of  trend, seasonality, and local variation hold for all the datasets. There may be some datasets that don't have trends or seasonality and some datasets contain very unpredictable pattern\n2. I am not sure how this work can impute missing data by factorization. Could you explain more?\n3. The sentence \"but also scales well to large datasets on which existing deep learning based methods struggle.\" in abstract is misleading.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper tackles the problem of imputing missing values in multivariate time series. As opposed to existing methods which depend on learning a single entangled representation to impute missing values, this paper proposes a disentangled matrix factorization based approach that aims to capture trend, seasonality and local bias as independent factors. This allows the proposed methods to be interpretable as well as scalable. The experiments claim to show improvement over existing methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The paper is overall well written, well motivated, the problem and the solution both are very clearly articulated. \n- This is a problem worth solving well as multivariate time series data are present in crucial applications and almost always require imputation. (Health monitoring is perhaps the most critical and obvious application of this)\n- The experiments include comparisons with a wide variety of competing and baseline methods. \n- The solution results in interpretable factors and is scalable.\n\nWeakness:\n- There is quite a bit of redundancy in the writing. e.g. the point that disentangled representations are better than entangled representations is made unnecessarily too many times. e.g. the first 6 lines of first paragraph in section 4.1 are not really needed in my opinion as that has already been said thrice earlier.\n\n- I'd have loved to see more discussion of the interpretability/explainability aspect in the main paper, more than just a single case study in experiments section. If redundancy is removed there's plenty of room for discussion about this in the paper.\n\n- My biggest concern is the objective function involves a lot of hyperparameters. And while the authors did a good job (from reproducibility perspective) of writing out all hyperparameter choices it is very much unclear how: 1) those choices can actually be made in practice (the current explanation in the appendix is too vague) and 2) how sensitive are the empirical results to hyperparameter choices. This second point is especially crucial since wrong choices can conceivably wipe out whatever improvement is gained from this method. I will be willing to reconsider my rating if this particular issue is resolved.",

It focuses on two rarely studied directions -- explaining the temporal representations and using the disentangled temporal representations to improve imputation performance, which is still a challenging task in both classical and deep learning based methods.\n2) The paper is well written. Experiments are sufficient and comprehensive and can prove the reliability as well as the explainability of the proposed method.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1)  The proposed method is based on matrix decomposition and may not be novel enough for ICLR. Also, disentangled factors are pre-defined and hard coded in the model -- Trend, seasonality, and bias factors. In reality, however, the hidden temporal factors of time-series data may be unknown, might be more complex, and should be learned as well. The paper may have limitations if given high dimensional temporal data or if multivariate time-series have more complex inter-channel correlations and variations.\n2) The training is specific for individual time-series data. The structure of latent space is not regularized over dataset to guarantee generalizable disentanglement.",
