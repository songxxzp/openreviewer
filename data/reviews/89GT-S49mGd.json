            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper discusses a regularized family of Renyi divergences using a variational function form. For this family of divergences the paper discusses various properties relating to limits, interpolations, data processing inequality. Examples of the importance of using the new variational Renyi divergences is demonstrated through examples (and counterexamples). Finally, the paper ends with a discussion of numerical applications: a) the variance of the convex-conjugate Renyi divergence estimators are much lower than that of estimators designed using the Renyi-Donsker-Varadhan variational formula when risk sensitive terms are detrimental to the DV-Renyi estimators; b) proposed infimal-convolution divergences are more suitable in the detection of rare sub-populations for a particular dataset; c) the proposed infimal-convolution divergences can perform better than Wasserstein GAN on the CIFAR-10 dataset; and d) the proposed divergences provides improvement on the ROTMNIST dataset. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Overall the paper is nicely written and describes well Renyi divergence and its background, and provides a good description of the paper's main results. In particular, the paper provides an interesting development to the study of Renyi divergences by introducing a new family of regularized Renyi divergences. \n\nSome minor comments on the strengths of the paper are:\n1. The paper includes clear description of definitions and main results. The highlights of contributions on Page 2 were very helpful to understanding the paper.\n2. The paper addresses Renyi divergences, an interesting and important topic, and provides interesting development to available results. The variational formulations of the Renyi divergence and the corresponding regularizations using an IPM (i.e., (6)) are very interesting. \n3. The paper considers a variety of numerical experiments, demonstrating flexibility in applications. \n\nSome minor comments on the weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. In the first experiment (Section 6.1), it would be interesting to see if CC-Renyi also performs better than DV-Renyi when distributions are close. In the experiment shown the two Gaussians are chosen to be N(2,0.5) and N(0,1) respectively and relative variance and MSE numbers are quite extreme for DV-Renyi -- it would be interesting if CC-Renyi also improves upon DV-Renyi for scenarios where say the two Gaussians are N(0,1) and N(0.1,1), for example. \n2. The first section in Section 5 may benefit from some more explanation. \n3. It may be helpful to adjust some of the citation formatting to make the paper more readable. For example, in the very first sentence of the Introduction, the two citations are a bit confusing to the overall readability of the sentence.\n4. The details to the last experiment seem to be slightly lacking; it would be helpful to add some more description to the main text. ",

The paper introduces interesting new results for the important field of Renyi divergences, and is closely related to the scope of ICLR.\n3. Overall, no major issues were identified in the main text.

The author derives some properties of the new divergence and show its dual form for computation. \n3. They derive the limit formula of divergence and present some special case of the new divergence.\n4. Empirical results show that the new divergence is more stable the Renyi divergence when $\\alpha >1$. \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The derivations of mathematical results of the paper are quite straightforward from known results.\n2. It is not clear for me the popularity of using new divergence in reality when $\\alpha >1$. For $\\alpha <1$, I do not see any advantage to have new divergence.\n3. In the application on biological datasets, the best results are obtained when $\\alpha = \\infty$. It means that we do not need to care about other values of $\\alpha \\in (1,\\infty)$, then why do we need to define the new divergence. \n4. In the experiment with GAN, the proposed divergence is used to improve the performance of generative model. The results are shown through the FID scores. We need to choose a particular $\\alpha$ such that it obtains the lowest FID. In this case, is there any explanation of using the proposed divergence rather than searching something in a larger space will obtain a lower minimum.\n\n",
