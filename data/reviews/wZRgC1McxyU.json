In particular, this paper focus on the setting where the observed trajectories of particles are driven by the interacting forces between the particles as well as a global force field. The entanglement of global and local effects makes recently popularized equivariant networks inapplicable, since they fail to capture global information. To address this issue, this work proposes to disentangle local object interactions from external global field effects. Specifically, a neural field is used to approximate the latent field and the interactions between particles are modeled with equivariant graph networks operating in local coordinate frames. Experiments show that the proposed approach accurately discovers the underlying fields in several interesting application.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n\nWhile previous works focus on the discovery of the interacting force between particles from the observable trajectory of particles, this work takes a step further by considering the existence of an underlying global force field. This generalized setting cannot be captured by the equivariant networks as they fail to capture global information. By incorporating an additional neural field, the authors design a new model, Aether, which in principle is able to automatically learn the interacting force and global force separately, which hence disentangles these two forces.\n\nWeakness:\n\n1. The global field is assumed to be independent of the observed objectives, but this seems to be a strong assumption, e.g. when the blackhole is considered as the source of the global field, its position and velocity are also affected by the planets around it. Therefore, this assumption may not hold, especially in a large time interval.\n2. While authors do consider the setting of dynamic field, it is clear how the interacting force can be disentangled from this time-varying dynamic field. In the worst case scenario, all forces can be described by a dynamic field.",

This work proposes a novel notion of disentangled equivariance, and proposes a framework to successfully disentangle global field effects from local system interactions that are equivariant to translations and rotations.\n2. They are able to predict global field effects that are latent by observing the system dynamics using neural fields.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. The paper need more work to explain the motivation and their method. Most of the explanation for base concepts is referred to in related papers. \n2. The experimental setup is not clear. Again, an explanation of datasets and learning problem should have been provided, either in the main paper or if not, in the supplementary.\n3. The relationship between the notion of approximate equivariance and disentangled equivariance is unclear from their description. In section 3.3, they mention that the difference lies in the fact that approximate equivariance tries to combine global field and local field effects. But it seems from their model description in section 3.1 that they are doing the same thing (especially from eqs. 5-7). Hence, the novelty of their notion of disentangled equivariance is unclear.\n4. The experiments are also conducted on fairly limited settings (in two dimensional systems) and in scenarios where the underlying global fields remain fixed throughout the interaction. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of this work.\n5. The results are also difficult to interpret and require more details about what is the ideal result and how the method compares to the baselines. For eg., in Figure 7, it is unclear what the figures represent and why the predicted and ground-truth fields look so different.\n\nOther things that could improve the paper:\n\n1. A more detailed description of their experimental setup, and datasets used in the supplementary would be helpful to making the method and its impact more clear.\n2.
