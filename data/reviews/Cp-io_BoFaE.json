            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents FluidEngine and FluidLab. FluidEngine is a differentiable physics engine that can simulate rigid objects, deformable objects, liquids, and gasses by combining different methodologies together. FluidLab is a suite of MDP environments for evaluating the efficacy of different algorithms on physical manipulation tasks. The tasks in this paper are diverse (from latte pouring to HVAC control) and manipulate many different kinds of objects. The results show that algorithms that can take advantage of the gradients provided by the engine perform significantly better on the tasks than algorithms that can\u2019t. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This is a strong experimental paper. It presents a differentiable physics engine alongside a series of tasks to demonstrate its value. The engine combines many different techniques to allow it to simulate a variety of material types such as rigid objects, plastics, liquids, and gasses. It also can compute the gradients of the state of the simulation, making it valuable for gradient-based techniques. Furthermore, the paper adds to this a set of experimental tasks designed to show the value of a differentiable physics engine. The tasks span a wide variety, from latte art to ice cream to HVAC control. The results in the paper clearly show that the gradient-based techniques are better able to solve the tasks, and in some cases the gradient-free techniques can\u2019t solve them at all.\n\nThe biggest weakness of this paper is that it doesn\u2019t present any novel methodology. It\u2019s essentially an announcement of a new library (FluidEngine) and an empirical argument around why it\u2019s useful (FluidLab). I actually don\u2019t see this as much of a weakness, if at all. With the fast pace of research these days, there is a strong incentive to focus on novel methods and sacrifice all else. This means that things like infrastructure and datasets (everyone makes their own, the days of Imagenet are over) and repeatable experiments often get overlooked. The fact that this paper stops to focus on that is actually beneficial to the field, and can provide a good testbed for future algorithms developed in this area. It\u2019s worth a publication to bring this to the attention of a wider audience.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is clear and well written. While it is not novel in the algorithmic sense, it does add a new tool for researchers to use as well as a set of standardized experiments to compare against. Furthermore, because this paper both makes the engine and the experiments public (or will do so upon acceptance according to the paper), reproducibility is high. It should be easy for future researchers to download the code and rerun the experiments on their own.\n\nThere are a few minor things missing however. The paper doesn\u2019t mention what the size of each timestep is (e.g., 0.1s). There also isn\u2019t any mention of how fast the engine is for each of the tasks. Does it run in real time on a modern computer? Slower? Faster? Finally, several RL policies are trained on the tasks. It\u2019s never stated what the input is, although it is explicitly stated the input is not rendered images. If the state of the world is represented mostly as particles, it is unclear how those particles are input into the RL policies. This is non-trivial, and should be clarified.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this is a good paper. It presents a new differentiable physics engine and a set of standardized tasks to go with it. The results in the paper clearly show that the use of gradients vastly improves the performance of the policies. While this paper doesn\u2019t present a novel algorithm, its contribution as a platform and experimental paper make it a high quality publication.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper introduces FluidLab, a platform for simulating interactions of complex fluids and solid objects. The platform includes a fully-differentiable and GPU-accelerated physics engine (FluidEngine), as well as an OpenGL renderer. FluidEngine is used to evaluate a few existing algorithms in the context of the FluidLab task set -- a set of 10 complex fluid manipulation tasks modeled on real-world scenarios that the authors define and introduce in the paper. The experimental part of the paper compares model-free RL to trajectory optimization based on sampling and differentiable physics. Access to gradient information of the simulation is shown to significantly benefit trajectory optimization.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is built around FluidEngine, which is also one of its main strengths. It represents a significant aggregation of capabilities in a single simulator, with alternatives falling short in terms of supported types of matter, differentiability, and source code access. An additional advantage in this context is the usage of the OpenAI Gym API. \n\nA weak side of this work is the lack of information about the validation of the physics engine. The authors are using existing methods, but implement them from scratch. A physics engine is a complex piece of software, which can suffer from subtle bugs which are hard to notice outside of a rigorous evaluation in setups with known solutions.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper is clearly written, well-organized, and should be understandable by people without a background in physical simulations. It refers to prior works as necessary. The authors promise to release the code for the engine and the sample simulations, which should allow users to reproduce the results presented in the paper. The paper itself of course does not offer sufficient space to fully document a complex engineering artifact like FluidEngine. \n\nAdditional novelties introduced in the paper are the set of complex tasks forming FluidLab, and a couple of \ntechniques for making better use of gradients and stabilizing the optimization problem (soft contact model, starting with a restricted temporal region, cross-particle gradient sharing). \n\nQuestions/suggestions:\n* What are the limitations of the solver in terms of density ratios, Reynolds numbers, etc? Are there any concerns about numerical stability?\n* How is mass taken into account in the SDF representation?\n* The text mentions that the mesh provides boundary conditions for the fluid; is momentum transfer from the fluid to the mesh allowed as well, i.e. is the coupling bidirectional?\n* I found it surprising that gases are simulated as an *incompressible* fluid, when one of the basic properties of gases is their compressibility. Could you please clarify the methodological choices here?\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this appears to be a significant piece of work, introducing a very useful piece of software, and proposing a set of standard tasks which require more complex physical interactions than those typically used in similar setups. The authors correctly note that a lot of prior work in the field of fluid manipulation involves relatively simple scenarios. The paper represents a significant advance towards more complex settings.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper describes a differentiable simulator for a series of tasks tailored towards robotic interactions. The system is MPM-based, and presents a range of different tasks that focus on interactions with fluids, all the way from two-dimensional transport to 3D manipulations. The paper then reiterates on the argumentation from previous work that using directional information in the form of gradients outperforms model-free RL approaches. On the side, the paper also briefly discusses modifications of the simulation based gradient calculations.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper presents an interesting range of test cases, and fluid interactions are definitely and interesting and challenging task for learning methods. The test cases also exhibit a nice complexity, and the paper contains a good range of classic RL methods that are compared to the differentiable physics variant.\n\nA big question that I had while reading is also how this engine is positioned in the existing environment of differentiable simulators. For the MPM cases, the engine seems to build on Taichi, but doesnt make clear how it extends it. Taichi already provides gradients since DiffTaichi - so is it merely a selection of scenes for Taichi, or are there changes to the simulator? The paper is currently written to advertise the \"FluidEngine\" simulator. However, it does not argue why it wold make sense to choose this simulator over existing ones, i.e. Taichi for MPM, or Phiflow for single phase cases (a discussion of the latter seems to be missing). In order to claim this system as a contribution, I think it would be important to run comparisons to show what advantages are to be gained over alternatives such as Taichi, Phiflow etc.\n\nThe selection of test cases also seems somewhat arbitrary to me. Why is there such a large focus on latte art and ice cream? These cases make for nice visuals, but if the goal of the paper is to establish these scenes as a more widely used benchmark, this seems strange to me. The remaining 6 cases establish a wider range of different behavior, and look more meaningful to me. In general, I would recommend to add structure to the selection and ordering of the cases. Also it would be good to argue why these particular scenes are worth considering as test cases. I definitely found it strange to start with \"latte-art\" instead of basic settings than build up to more complex ones.\n\nA smaller note, but I would also caution against statements that the DP variants yield fundamentally better learned states than the RL variants. In the limit of infinite compute a well-tuned RL algorithm will eventually discover these as well. DP might get there much faster, but there's no reason RL should not discover these states at some point.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "As mentioned above, it is an interesting direction, but the advantages over existing simulators are left unclear in the current submission. A better motivation (and potential adjustment) of the test cases would also be a good idea.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "My main open question is that of advantages over existing simulators. Table 1 is not sufficient here: other differentiable fluid simulators like (Diff)Taichi, Phiflow and JAX-Fluids are already out there, so I don't understand why they're left out, and how the work distinguishes itself here. The RL comparisons are interesting, and the tweaks for proper convergence likewise. Here, I think the paper undersells a bit: there's likewise no effort to put this into context of existing works at ICLR, and as such they don't play a very prominent role. Thus, taken together from the current state of the submission, this looks like a paper below the acceptance threshold to me.\n\n---\n\nPost rebuttal: the authors have provided a nice update, together with the other assessments, I'd be happy to support accepting this paper.",
