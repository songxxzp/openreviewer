            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper explains that randomized smoothing is no longer sound in floating-point arithmetic. The paper then proposes a more solid approach to randomized smoothing when using floating-point precision that yields sound certificates for image classifiers. Since adversarial attacks are of critical importance for security-related applications, certified robustness is an important topic. These certificates need to hold in finite precision. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper identifies qualitatively new issues with randomized smoothing approach when using floating-point arithmetic. One expects potentially more issues when the numbers that appear in a classifier are large as this when floating point makes large absolute error in representing numbers. Since randomized rounding is used as a model for understanding the accumulation of errors in floating-point arithmetic when analyzing algorithms, I suspect that the issues that the paper is raising are quite minor in practice. \n\nThe sound randomized smoothing procedure in floating-point arithmetic results in negligible computational overheads in the image classification example, when compared to unsound certificates. \n\nA weakness of the paper is that the differences between the unsound practice and sound certificates are very small in the image classification example. Therefore, the manuscript has not demonstrated that caring about floating point arithmetic will make significant difference in practice.",

The finite precision of IEEE-754 floating point numbers causes the addition of noise not to work as mathematically expected. This leads to an overestimation of the robustness properties and unsound certificates. This is also showcased in a toy example.\nLastly, a solution based on discretized noise is proposed and evaluated.",

The paper also provides an efficient way to sample from the distribution making the approach practical.\n\nWeakness\n- Although not stated explicitly, the general belief is the safety guarantees of different data points are independent of one another. The single sampling framework needs to give a union bound over all points to ensure there are not too many failure cases.\n- The paper does not show the vulnerability of real-world networks to floating point errors.
