            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. The essential idea of the article is to select some best candidate nodes for graph mapping, thus leveraging inter-graph information. The author proposed a novel differential evolutionary algorithm to determine the most supportive candidates.\n2. The numerical outcomes are good, especially F1 score.\n3. The ablation test shows the differential evolutionary process is essential after selecting k informative nodes as candidates.\n\nWeakness:\n1. There are some confusing notations in Section 4.2.2. For inforamtive node selection, the author states the top k nodes most similar to normal graph, but only gives the similarity calculation between a node j and a graph G_i , with no clue how node score is aggregated (by summation?) (2) For candidate initialization, rigorously speaking, it should be $\\{0, 1\\}^{| C_i |}$ not $\\{0, 1\\}^{| C_p |\\}$; the parameter $p_s$ in Bernoulli distribution is unstated in the experiment setting. For updating a set of candidates, the subscript of diagonal matrix $I^t$ is supposed to range from 1 to p, according to the (1) Initialization. However, the author claims to select r1, r2, r3, r4, r5 from [1, $| C_i^t |$], where $| C_i^t |$ represents the size of candidate nodes. By the way, why the author chooses 5 candidates to mutate? There is no stated evidence to determine five. \n2. In Section 4.2.2., the author says that DE algorithm guaranteed convergence, however, metaheuristics such as DE do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. Some sufficient conditions must be verified before claiming (global) convergence. \n3. In Section 4.2.2., the evaluation score is suspected to be wrong. Because when true y = 1, the successful prediction with \\hat{y}=1 yields score as 0, while the failed prediction with \\hat{y}=0 has a score as 1. It is strange to see when true y = 0, the positive result (\\hat{y}=0) is scored as 1, wheras the score of negative prediction is equal to 2. The scores are inconsistent and biased, without much explanation.\n4. In the evaluation step, the author states to implement SVM on every mutation. Considering there are $p$ condidates and $et$ iterations, it will be very time-consuming and not scalable to large number of graphs.\n5. In the abstract, it was claimed that the paper aims to address the low interpretability of GNN. However, in the main context, it is not clear which characteristic of the proposed method can address the problem. And there is also no numerical result to support the claim.\n6. It seems that the baselines OCGIN and OCGTL are unsupervised methods. It is not clear how the authors perform them in comparison to the proposed semi-supervised method.\n7. It is not clear why the authors didn't use AUC as an evaluation metric. The F1 score, precision, and recall are not good enough for imbalanced classification and usually depend on a classification threshold.",

The focus of this paper is on detecting anomalies using graph-level classification. \nGraph-level anomaly detection is not a new problem. The authors claimed that previous literature has not addressed both intra-graph and  inter-graph relationships as being important features for finding anomalous graphs. \nThis paper clearly explained the issues with the previous methods and pointed to two important aspects lacking in previous solutions. First aspect had to do with not taking into consideration inter-graph relations when finding anomalous graphs. Previous methods focused primarily on intra-graph relations. The second aspect is the GNN's inherent lack of explainability.\nTo address both problems the authors introduced a pipeline that would link graphs (neighborhood nodes aggregated representations) with the most informative set of nodes (taken from all graphs). They would then transform the graphs into candidate feature space and find the best candidate set by applying differential evolution algorithm. The end stage of their pipeline involves running a classifier on graphs in candidate feature space. \nAs a result the authors claim to improve both explainability and model efficacy.",

We know that some methods are black boxes and others can be easily interpreted, but this leaves a lot of ground in between. It would be useful if interpretability could also be expressed more precisely.\n\nAlso, I would like to ask the authors about their for the future work. Is there there something in their current method they would like to improve upon?\n\nOn more question. Could the authors explain how the negative effect of the curse of dimensionality gets avoided during the informative node selection stage?\n",

Specifically, GmapAD encapsulate graph structures and node features into node representations and selects the best subset of informative nodes in all possible nodes in graphs for mapping graphs into the new feature space. Then normal and anormal graphs are mapped to deviating locations in the feature space and classified using machine learning techniques (e.g., SVM). Experiments conducted on 9 benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art GNN models and graph-level anomaly detection methods.\n",

(1), the author simply uses the average pooling as a graph pooling operation. But, If using attention-based pooling operations ([1], [2], [3]), I think the globally informative node selection is possible with GNN itself without additional candidate optimization. It would be good to have a comparison between GNNs with attention-based pooling and GNNs with candidate optimization.\n\n- I cannot agree with the author\u2019s statement \u201cMost importantly, simply reading out graph representations using its own nodes cannot capture the inter-graph information.\u201d.  Even though each graph has different nodes, since the features of nodes are in the same space, inter-graph information can be captured with graph representations from GNNs with a readout function.\n\n- The author stated that interpretability is an advantage of a framework that proposes interpretability, but there is no analysis of this. \n\n[1] Gao, Hongyang, and Shuiwang Ji. \"Graph u-nets.\" international conference on machine learning.
