            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a 3D human pose and shape estimation system that takes a RGB video as an input. Most of the previous works take pre-defined mean poses and shapes for the iterative feedback-based regression. On the other hand, the proposed system learns such prior poses and shapes through the self-attention mechanism. In addition, the proposed system models temporal information with separate joint-level tokens. Experimental results demonstrate powerful performance of the system.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n1. Learning the prior poses and shape in a data-driven way using self-attention is an interesting point. \n2. Strong performance on multiple benchmarks.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. Insufficient ablation studies.\nOne major contribution of this paper is that it learns prior poses and shapes through the self-attention mechanism. However, there is no direct comparison between 1) using fixed average poses and shapes (used in HMR) and 2) using learnable poses and shapes, while fixing all other components of the system. This ablation is necessary to show the effectiveness of the learned pose and shape priors.\n\n2. Lack of justification of the architecture.\nIn Fig. 2, there can be several variants. First, heads can additionally take image feature tokens instead of only taking prior tokens. Second, passing only image feature tokens (without prior tokens) to Transformer and passing prior tokens to the heads following iterative feedback-based methods (HMR and others). Basically, I can\u2019t get fundamental design philosophy of the current system that takes prior tokens and uses features only from prior tokens for the final output.\n\n3. Temporal modeling only with a single joint might be sub-optimal as the output rotations are relative rotation wrt. their parent joints. Hence, I think three joints, including child and parent joints, might perform better.\n",

Therefore, I'd like to keep my original score instead of raising it.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes an approach for the estimation of human body 3D pose and shape from monocular input (single image or video). The core idea is to use learnable independent tokens for the joint rotations, the camera parameters (the weak-perspective camera model is used) and the body shape, as expressed in the used SMPL model. This allows for an extension for the case of video, with the temporal information first captured per joint by the respective token, and then decoded by a suitable temporal transformer. This approach implicitly imposes temporal smoothness, yielding temporally consistent results with minimized (but not eliminated) jitter.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The manuscript clearly presents the core idea and provides intuitive justification on why the proposed approach is beneficial for the task at hand. The literature overview is comprehensive within the space limitations, the method description is clear, and the experimental results are extensive and convincing. Apart from a few syntax and grammar errors (and also the use of the word \"achieve\" instead of \"compute\", please fix this) this is a well-written paper overall.\n\nI don't have any major points of criticism, rather some thoughts for potential improvement: Recent advances in human pose estimation using transformers indicate that it is beneficial to use more queries than the total number of estimated keypoints (see eg Li et al. \"Pose Recognition With Cascade Transformers\" 2021 -- a good reference to add to the literature overview by the way, despite the fact that it only regresses 2D keypoints). It is not clear whether such an approach would also be beneficial with the proposed approach, or even possible. Please consider commenting on this, it is unclear to me whether it also makes sense to experiment on this.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "In my opinion the clarity of presentation is fine given the space constraints. To the best of my knowledge, the presented approach is novel for the task at hand. Transformer architectures have been applied before for the problem, but this specific approach allows for state-of-the-art results and temporal consistency. Similarly, independent tokens have been proposed before, but not in the given context. Furthermore, the use of these tokens allows for a straightforward temporal extension, which constitutes a novel contribution to the best of my knowledge. Lastly, reproducibility is not an issue here to the best of my understanding.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall I think that, despite the limited novelty, it is still a well presented idea that achieves state-of-the-art results in the problem that is worth accepting in ICLR.",
