For example, graph augmentation/enrichment is known in literature as well as metric learning based loss functions as well as the auto covariance based similarity matrix which has demonstrated excellent performance for link prediction based tasks.\n\n2) The approach felt pretty heuristic. In particular the approach is strongly dependent on a similarity metric/function and an associated threshold. The paper does not contain any discussion as to how to choose this similarity metric/function and the associated threshold in general. The authors themselves choose cosine similarity but does this work well in all scenarios. The current work requires more discussion in general. \n\n3) The current work should have included more baselines to compare against. \n\n4) The current work does not list any limitations and/or potential directions for improvement which would have significantly added to the value associated with the work. As mentioned earlier, the current work requires more discussion to be included in general. ",

For example: in Page 2 the authors claim existing approaches \"highly overestimate\" the ratio of positive pairs. I feels skeptical about this claim, as the negative pairs are randomly drawn rather than fixed. It is not clear to me why they are biased towards positive pairs. Similarly, I am not clear about why prior approaches need to construct a biased test dataset.\n- I in person believe there is a gap between the motivation and the model design. The only connection I can see is the objective Eq. (16) uses a full set of negative links, where prior approaches can do this as well.\n- Experimental results are not fully convincing. On several experiments (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed) the improvements seem marginal. The overall dataset sizes are small. It seems that the model is very sensitive to the parameter $\\eta$. More explanations are needed. Also, more head-to-head ablation studies are needed. For example, I am curious whether the graph structure learning component (Attributes+Topology) can be used with conventional training schemes.",
