How is the input observation represented (image or feature-based)? How many object categories? How large is the agent's vocabulary? How are the environment graph generated? It is thus difficult to comprehend the significance of solving this environment. \n* The plots are missing confidence intervals. Each experiments are not conducted multiple times with different random seeds. This seriously weakens the empirical claims.",

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "While this paper goes in a good direction by moving away from the Lewis game in the language emergence communication setting, it falls short as there is little scientific analysis. The authors mainly designed an artificial navigation task, handcrafted an observation space and reward, designed a neural network, trained it, and reported the results. Those results are not put into perspective with a detailed researched perspective. Indeed, the point of Emecom in ML is not to create artificial tasks for the sake of solving it, but to design tasks that could help understand how language evolves with a human intervention as possible (or being generic). \n\nI am listing here a few leads to improve the paper in the long run:\n - The introduction should frame the research problem into the past literature, ask a scientific question, and explain how the paper help answers it. Here, there is no citation; the VLM task is only said to be more natural (no reference to the embodiment, situated learning, or going beyond the signaling game)\n - The related work is extremely short. 18 citations in total for a paper about language emergence, and the navigation task is just inherently incomplete. On a positive note, the most relevant citations kajic/Kanilowska/DeVries are present\n- The paper is 7 pages long, and page 3 is barely empty\n- The model is designed to solve the task, e.g., the graph networks are specific to the observation space. I would recommend either picking a minimal architecture or reproducing the architecture that is classic in VLM. \n- having 4 losses in an RL task is generally a bad sign as it is a symptom of human intervention. cf The bitter lesson by Sutton\n - Results are not compared to any baselines (VAE vs your network is not really a baseline...), and simply reporting the success rate is not sufficient. Examples of suitable ablation include: the correlation between language and environment complexity. Qualitative experiments to translate language and change in the environment (e.g., how changing the graph impacts the language), what are the external constraints that shape language, reward ablation, etc.\n\nI would recommend the authors to re-work their paper and present it to a workshop to have further guidance. The initial idea is good, but the realization lacks scientific maturity.\n\n\n\n\n",
