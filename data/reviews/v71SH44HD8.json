            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper, the authors propose a new time series forecasting model for univariate high-frequency time series. There two major components/blocks of the model: one block contains ensemble of base predictors/LSTM for time series forecasting and the second spatial block is trained using contrastive learning to find the best base predictor or LSTM. The whole model works like the minimax framework. Experiments on online forecasting and zero-shot clustering show efficacy of the proposed method.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\nThe whole framework looks novel and incorporates recent advances in ML like contrastive learning for time series forecasting. \n\nWeakness\nMotivations and rationale behind the proposed model is not well explained. It is not very clear how these components interact and why all the components work in a synergetic way.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Clarity needs improvement to make the whole framework easy to follow and understand. \nNovelty looks pretty good. However, I only see empirical support and there are no theoretical guarantees. \nReproducibility is feasible with the submitted code.\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "1. Regarding contrastive loss, we know that it works fine for images. Here the motivation and rationale of employing the distance-weighted contrastive loss DWCL for univariate time series forecasting is not clear to me. How are similar and dissimilar pairs selected in the training process?\n2. What is the benefit of using a two-dimensional discrete state-space in the S-block? For the purpose of selecting the best base predictor, one-dimensional state-space should be enough. Also in the training of the S-block, cross-entropy loss function is used which actually works fine with the one-dimensional state-space.\n3. In Sec. 3.3, why does ensemble weight sharing help for time series forecasting? If we wanna a diverse ensemble which can cover a broader state-space, should we limit the use of ensemble weight sharing which may lead to the mode collapse (common challenge in GAN).\n4. The S-block actually reminds me the attention mechanism which can also be used to select the optimal state/predictor. It would be interesting to see discussion on comparison of S-block and attention. For example, what are the advantages of S-block over attention and gating in the temporal fusion transformer (TFT).\n5. In practice, individual LSTM has limited forecasting power compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms for time series forecasting. More analysis on how ensemble of LSTMs could achieve better prediction performance will help reader to understand the contribution and novelty of this work.\n6. Evaluations are limited and only done on two datasets which makes it less convincing. More experiments and comparisons with SOTA methods are encouraged",

In the proposed approach, two distinct components are simultaneously learned: a recurrent neural network ensemble that captures states in high-frequency time series, as well as a spatial block that is able to spatially resolve state changes based on the predictions generated by the other network.

The proposed method can be applied to time series in a variety of applications, as indicated in the abstract. Consequently, it would be beneficial if authors benchmarked the proposed technique against several real-world datasets.\n\nb) The performance of the proposed method should be compared with similar state-of-the-art approaches. That would be interesting to compare the proposed method with some recent studies in Transformers, Energy-Based approaches, and Reinforcement Learnings.\n\nc) The figures and tables in this paper are ambiguous. As an example, what are the metrics in Table 1 (mean column) and Table 2? Furthermore, Figure 2 is blurry and difficult to read.\n\nd) In this paper, the notations are confusing. In regular papers, scalers are denoted by small letters; vectors are defined with small letters (highlighted in bold), and matrices are denoted by capital letters using bold. In this paper, they are a lot of conflicts. It is so hard to trace what is a set, a matrix, or even a distribution.\n\nf) There are some minor linguistic and typo problems in this paper.\n",

Is the method clinically relevant given the low silhouette scores obtained? Could be interesting to visualize ECG forecasting.

I don\u2019 t understand what it means to predict 20 ECG samples (what is the sampling frequency? Given the typical ECG sampling frequency, 20 samples would correspond to less than 100ms, so I fail to understand the clinical usefulness of predicting such a short window of ECG samples\n2.\tThe description of the proposed method lacks clarity. I would suggest present the methodology of the technique in a more structure way, clearly explaining how he training process is performed.\n3.\tI fail to understand the contrastive learning approach of the method. Do the authors suggest that the spatial representation is time independent? Could the authors compare their approach to a BYOL approach?  On top of that, one of the characteristics of biomedical times-series lies in their non-stationarity nature which would imply that the assumption of stable spatial representation does not hold.
