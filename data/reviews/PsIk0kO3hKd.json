            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors of this submission proposed a deep non-stationary kernel (DNSK) modeling Spatio-Temporal Point Processes (STPP) for potentially non-stationary events in continuous time and space. \n\nThe authors focused on Hawkes process assuming that the influences from the past events are linearly additive and in turn modeled the conditional intensity function as $\\lambda(t, s) = \\mu + \\sum_{History} k(t, t', s, s')$, where $k(t, t', s, s')$ is named as the influence kernel function, which captures the spatio-temporal dependency. Specifically, DNSK assumes a factorized kernel along time and space directions, as well as potential event \"marks\" when they are available to handle potential computational challenges. Furthermore, by considering parametrization with \"displacement\", the authors claimed that DNSK achieves low-rank kernels for more efficiency. The log-barrier method is introduced to preserve non-negativity of the conditional intensity function, also maintaining model interpretability and computational efficiency. \n\nExperiments were performed comparing some existing methods: RMTPP, Neural Hawkes (NH), Transformer Hawkes process (THP), Parametric Hawkes process (PHP), Neural spectral marked point processes (NSMPP) with the proposed DNSK without log-barrier but with a non-negative softplus activation function (DNSK+Softplus). The results showed that the proposed method can indeed capture the non-stationarity and achieve good model recovery and event prediction performances.  ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Efficient modeling non-stationary spatio-temporal processes is challenging. The authors followed recent efforts, in particular Zhu et al. 2022, Zou et al. 2020, etc. to develop a \"displacement\"-parametrized neural network based kernels in a Hawkes process model to address the potential computational challenges. The empirical results demonstrated the efficacy of their proposed DNSK. \n\nClearer discussion besides the illustration in Figure 1 may be needed for clearer motivation and insights. For example, it may be necessary to discuss the pros and cons of factorized kernel assumptions and displacement-based parametrization. When introducing Figure 1, the authors may want to briefly mention the computational advantages and difference of the actual event prediction performance before and after using \"displacement\" on the kernels with the same rank. Although the figure did show that the displacement-based kernel matrix with rank 7 also has three peaks as the original kernel with rank 298, it may be necessary to provide numerical kernel performance measure. The authors may also want to discuss more about the reason for building up the kernels using linear combinations of MLP-based basis functions. As MLPs are assumed to have good approximation capability, is it still necessary to have the linear combination of these MLPs to make the kernel more complicated? \n\nThe authors may want to make there empirical performance comparison results more consistent to have all the results reported from all the selected baselines. For example, it may be interesting to explore on the effectiveness of log-likelihood because the potential mismatch of log-likelihood and MSE regarding the THP performance on 1D Data set 2 and 1D Data set 3. For the real-world data, instead of showing the performances of some baselines, the authors may want to present the results from all the applicable baselines. \n\n\n\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "DNSK appears as an extension of previous neural process models with \"displacement\"-based factorized neural kernels. Such an implementation does provide some performance improvement based on the reported experiments. \n\nOverall presentation is reasonable clear. The authors may want to consider further improve the presentation, for example, better justify the adopted kernels. There are also several language problems throughout the submission: for example. $B(s,\\Delta s)$ seems to be a ball set with the center $s$ and radius $\\Delta s$ but is not defined; symbol $f$ is used as transformation in page 3 but as pdf of the event in page 8;  and many others throughout the submission.

Empirical performance comparison results have shown the efficacy of the proposed DNSK methods. Better justification of the adopted kernels, in particular linear combination of MLP-based kernel bases, may be needed. More comprehensive empirical experimental results may need to be provided to confirm the benefits of DNSK compared to the previous similar efforts. \n\n====post-rebuttal====\n\nI truly appreciate the extensive efforts from the authors to address my questions.",
