            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper tackles the task of generalized class discovery where both labelled and unlabelled data can be encountered during inference. The authors proposed a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to solve this problem, which is built upon a known clustering method. The proposed approach is equipped with the capability of generating reliable pseudo labels as well as fast estimating unseen class numbers. The proposed method is evaluated on several popular benchmarks, which demonstrates promising results.",

For instance, why should samples linked by chains? Why should chains be connected under certain regulations? Why is it significant and necessary? These are just proposed but not well justified. \n",

Both clustering-based positive pair mining and supervised contrastive learning based on the selected pairs are not new techniques in the community.\n\n- The description of Sec.3.3 and Sec.3.4 is hard to understand.\n\n- The improvement over the original FINCH sometimes is limited. For example, in Table 5, when applying SNC on only unlabeled data, it should be mostly similar to FINCH with unlabeled data. However, the full method does not produce a clear improvement on the SNC with u-u.\n\n- The memory cost comparison between Cip and GCD should be provided in Table 3.\n\n\n",

It seems the key contribution is the SNC which can help generate pseudo labels. The authors claim that SNC is inspired by and similar to FINCH.
