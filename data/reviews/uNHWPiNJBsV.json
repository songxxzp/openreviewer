The proposed method includes a normalizing flow based context encoder, a NeRF scene function, and a VAE based renderer. By using a set of latent variables rather than one latent variable, the proposed method can make multiple different predictions for unobserved regions in novel view synthesis. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms baseline methods including MVC-NeRF and NeRF VAE.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "+ The idea of using the latent set representation is novel.\n\n+ The design of multiple latent variables makes it possible to make multiple different predictions in unobserved regions.\n\n+ LASER outperforms MVC-NeRF and NeRF VAE in experimental analysis. LASER produces a sharper result.\n\n- The experiments are done on synthetic data only, where the camera pose is accurate. However, in real cases, there is always error in camera poses. It would be good if the author could show the result on real data (like in the original NeRF paper) so that we could understand its robustness to pose errors.\n\n- The explanation on obtaining \"z\" for rendering is unclear. It would be good if mathematical equations are provided in Sec. 3.3 \"Querying the Latent Set\" so that the readers could better understand how \"z\" is computed and where the randomness comes from.\n\n- Although the results are better than baseline results, they are still blurry, e.g., in Fig. 3. It should be analyzed as limitations. However, the paper did not analyze the limitations of the proposed method.",

The differences are that the proposed methods use a set of latent vectors to encode the scenes instead of one and it incorporates multi-view geometry local features for better feature learning. It also applies normalizing flow to model conditional prior and conditional posterior. Experiments show that the method outperforms baselines on both reconstructions of observed views and predictions of unobserved novel views.",

According to the experiments, the latent set representation has a good scaling ability.\n- The proposed methods have a better performance in predicting unobserved views compared to NeRF-VAE.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The current City dataset is relatively simple. Can the method work on more complex scenes, such as multiple ShapeNet objects (like PixelNeRF) or real dataset?\n- I am concerned about the technical novelty of this paper. The idea of set latent scene representation is actually not a new thing, like Scene Representation Transformer, CVPR 2022. Moreover, aggregating multi-view local features is a standard technique in computer vision, and has been widely used in many existing works, including PixelNeRF, IBRNet etc. The proposed frameworks seem to be a combination of existing techniques in spite of the performance improvement. I am afraid the novelty is below the bar of ICLR.\n",

The proposed model is tested on synthetic city dataset and ShapeNet dataset, while having competitive performance with respect to recent methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**\n- Performance\n\nBy looking at the figures and tables of the manuscript, the work clearly outperforms NeRF-VAE [1], producing less blurry images from multiple views. However, I would like to ask the authors why SRT [2] was not used as a baseline.\n\n- Good experimental design\n\nI enjoyed showing that increasing the latent vector size of NeRF-VAE does not result in a good performance, thereby the design choice of this work is better. The ablations by showing with performance with/without either latent set and local features make the paper stronger.\n\n\n**Weaknesses**\n- Novelty\n\nMy main concern lies in the novelty of the work. The work seems to be a mixture of NeRF-VAE and SRT. Please see the novelty section below for details.\n\n\n- Intuition behind the set data structure for the scene latents\n\nAlthough it is clear from Table 1, that the scene latents increase the performance of the method, I would like to ask the authors the intuition behind the sets as the choice for the latent data structure. Other works such as Neural Sparse Voxel Fields [3] either have an explicit latent data structure, where the latent code explicitly encodes local information or alot of other generative modeling works show the controlability of latent code by interpolating them. I do not see either of the intuition behind the set representation nor other attributes of set-valued latent representation and would like to hear from the authors the reason for choosing particularly this data structure besides the performance.\n\n- Proposed model requires depth information\n\nAlthough the authors have reported the log-likelihood score of the method in the appendix without depth information, reporting all the scores in Table 1 without depth information will strengthen the paper.\n\n[1] Kosiorek et al.

Although the taking advantages of other methods does not necessarily reduce the novelty of the work, using the latent code of NeRF-VAE, thereby having multimodality and using set-representation latent code of SRT is straightforward with no huge novelty in the problem setting.\n\n- Quality\n\nThe experimental design of the paper is well, although some more ablation studies could help.\n\n- Reproducibility\n\nCode is not uploaded.
