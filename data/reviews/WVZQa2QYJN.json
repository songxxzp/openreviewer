            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The dataset is rich, containing information at several altitude levels, during 2 years, and with additional fields that are not always present in such datasets.\n- the comparison with other datasets is detailed, clear and very useful\n- a large number of state-of-the-art deep learning methods are compared on this dataset\n- a study on uncertainty estimation, performed by varying the seed of the learning phase, is performed\n\nWeaknesses:\n- from the table 1, it is not clear how this new dataset would make a difference, in particular, it looks to me that the fact that this dataset is coarse (the one with the smaller grid size yet on a large region) is probably very limiting for a task such as precipitation.\n- there are no methodological novelties\n- the uncertainty estimation is rather simple\n",

The release of such dataset is important, and it is good for the community to have access to it, but it can't be the main contribution of an ICLR paper.\nBoth codes and data are released, even if it is not possible to access it now (the url is hidden due to blind review)",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The paper is very clear and presents an interesting database and benchmark of different precipitation forecasting databases and deep learning forecast estimation models.
