For instance, in the preliminaries section, a potential outcome is never defined, $\\phi$ is not defined, the notation $\\phi(\\cdot | t)$ is not defined, Def. 2 and the notation do(t) independent of U are highly non standard and should be explained. Given this I don't understand the motivation section of the paper.\n- Assumptions 5 and 6 should be discussed in more detail. It is not clear how plausible they are. Especially, assumption 6 seems to directly contradict the causal graph in Fig. 1.\n- To my knowledge none of the semi-synthetic datasets incorporate a proxy structure in their data generating mechanisms. Are these changed to fit the setting in this paper. Do you loose performance when the correct thing to do is simply condition on observed covariates, i.e. if there are no unobserved confounders?\n\n**Suggestions** \n- One reference on ITE with continuous treatment could be added: Bellot, Alexis, Anish Dhir, and Giulia Prando. \"Generalization bounds and algorithms for estimating conditional average treatment effect of dosage.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14692 (2022).",

I think the paper would benefit from a more detailed discussion regarding how realistic this simplification is and in which cases it holds.\n- The paper makes many assumptions; while I believe that this is needed to be able to handle the setting of unobserved confounders, the papers should include a more detailed discussion about the implications of these assumptions and how realistic they are in practice. \n- It it unclear how learning the representation f(X) through contrastive learning helps with recovering the hidden confounders. In particular, why does strengthening the association between treatments T and covariates X helps to recover the unmeasured common cause U? I believe the authors should describe this in more detail, and if possible, develop theory to support this claim which I believe is crucial for the paper. \n- To approximate the treatment score $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbf{T} \\mid \\mathbf{U})$ the paper assumes it follows a Gaussian mixture model and uses a mixture density network to learn it. I believe that this assumption about the distribution of the treatments given the unobserved confounders should be more explicitly acknowledged and again discussed in which setting it is valid. \n\n",

This is done by based on combining contrastive regularizer to learn the proxy representation, and ranked weighting method to de-bias the treatment assignment mechanism estimation. The authors claims that the proposed method can avoid the deficiencies of existing methods that rely on correctly specified treatment assignment models and/or require strong prior of the unobserved confounder distribution. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**\n\n- The proposed method is new to the best of my knowledge. Under the proxy assumption, the paper proposes to combine contrastive learning of the proxies and the rank weight estimations of the propensity scores to estimate treatment effects.\n- The paper has relatively extensive set of baselines and plenty of tasks in the experimental analysis part. I also appreciate that the authors have detailed all synthetic functions in the appendix for reproducibility. \n\n**Weakness**\n- Missing important references and lacks clear motivation.  The problem setting of this paper is very closely related to (Yixin, 2021), which should definitely be mentioned and compared. I found it hard to be convinced by the author's argument that \"existing methods rely on correctly specified treatment assignment models and/or require strong prior of the unobserved confounder distribution\", since the identification results in (Wang, 2021) does not rely on any of these. Given those, the paper lacks key motivations for the Cr + Rw approach.\n\n- The claim that \"our method need no data distribution prior and outperforms others in performance\" is not very convincing. To some degree, the choice of similarity functions in the contrastive learning part already implicitly assumes certain prior preferences. Even assuming it's true that this method requires absolutely no prior, this comes at a cost of: 1), one needs to specify the similarity function as well; 2), the identifiability of both treatment effects and latent confounders become unclear. \n\n- Although the proposed method is new, I don't immediately see the key novelty of the paper. The contrastive learning is not a new method and has been used for learning latent representations for a long time; the rank weighting might have certain degree of novelty, however I don't see how this relates to the proxy causal learning setting. It looks more like a standalone estimator on this own and needs more theoretical analysis and experiment evaluation for justification.  \n- Lacks rigorous theoretical analysis. For example, the authors claim that \" learned representation E(X) refuse the information of $\\epsilon_1$ and maintain the information of $U$, which means we eliminate the error item...\", which is too heuristic and needs to be formally derived. Also, the paper lacks identifiability analysis for $U$ (or treatment effects). Without those analysis, Eq(11) that the authors proposes hardly qualifies as an \"identification\"; and simply dodging this issue by hand-waving \" The performance of using proxy to estimate ADRF depends on the degree of recovery of $U$\" is clearly unconvincing. \n\n**Minor issues**\n\n- In related works, the paper cited a bunch of methodologies and claims that the proposed method \"outperforms others in performance\". Unfortunately, many of those mentioned in this part are not used in experiments at all. The authors need to be careful on what their claims and avoid over-selling.\n\n- The writing of the paper is not very consistent. For some parts it is very clear and convincing, but for some other parts it is very confusing and I found it hard to understand what the authors are trying to do. I finally managed to understand most of it, but at the cost of reading it multiple times and making my own guess on a number of undefined terms and notations. \n\n\n**Reference**\n\nWang, Yixin, and David Blei. \"A proxy variable view of shared confounding.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
