That is, some existing learning-based solvers tried to embed problem instances by coordinates of points (to be visited by TSP for example), but the paper is investigating whether or not the coordinate-based embedding is poisonous for DL models.\n\nThe paper evaluated the concept numericaly based on the existing AM implementation. Using synthethic TSP data (with perturbations by rotations, translations (e.g., Afffine transformation), and distance scaling), the robustness and generalization ability is validated. Using real oline food delivery service system data, with metrics of KRC, LSD, and CR, distance-based embeddings show better results on test data.",

As it is based on the existing well-known learning-based solver (AM), the problem (on embeddings) is well introduced in the first part. The experimental evaluations are well explained and displayed clearly.\n\n- For the quality and originality of the work, I feel that the contribution is a bit weak, particularly for publishing the result in top-tier conferences. The experimental resutls on both synthetic TSP and food delivery data are interesting and meaningful, and I agreed with this that both question and the barrier example in Fig.1 are interesting for routing problems. However, the result on the synthetic data seems to be almost straightforward results. Using distance embedding is also a straightfoward way to embed two dimensional points. If some barrier can be observed, it is natural to embed their information as well (no only points). So, the importance and quality of the the experimental results, at least in the current form, seems to be limited in my opinion.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "Authors study how the inclusion of nodes' coordinates into deep learning-based routing models affects the performance and robustness of these models. They evaluate different methods of embedding coordinates on synthetic traveling salesman problem task and FPD (Food Pickup and Delivery? Authors don't seem to spell out the acronym) task. They empirically demonstrate that only providing distance information outperforms only providing coordinate information or both.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "While the featurization of input to DL-based routing models is known to make a substantial impact to model performance, the impact of coordinate embeddings has not been systematically studied. For example, Bogyrbayeva et al https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02369 (see Figure 6) did show that adding coordinate information makes a significant impact on model performance. Authors' systematic study provides clearer insight on the impact of coordinate information.\n\nAnother strength of the paper is that authors validate their approach on a realistic data from a large-scale production system. However, the data doesn't seem to be publicly available, which somewhat diminishes the value because others will not be able to validate the result.\n\nMy biggest concern is that it is unclear to which extent the problem raised by authors is specific to the particular experimental setting considered in this paper. Existing methods including Kool et al (which authors' implementation is based upon) does not use distance information. If authors' claim holds broadly, then they should be able to compare against Kool et al's approach on every benchmark task Kool et al considered, and demonstrate the comparative improvement. However, authors depart from the baseline paper's setting, and design a new setting that is in favor of their method: location of nodes are fixed to 10k points in training, and only at the test time they generalize to new locations. It is somewhat interesting to understand that models trained on fixed points do not generalize to new points, but if we knew the need for generalization to new points at the training time, we could've incorporated that into the creation of training instances. Similarly, if we knew the model needs rotation/translation/scaling invariance, we could've incorporated that into data augmentation step in training. Hence I am concerned authors are not showing the full picture: authors only experiment with non-standard settings which are in favor of their method. Data augmentation could've been an easy, standard remedy to the raised problem, which wasn't explored and thus significantly restricts how well authors' claim shall be generalized.\n\nAuthors seem to claim that coordinate information should be removed for routing tasks, but it is unclear to me. Distance information by itself cannot fully recover coordinate information, and thus there has to be class of routing problems which using distance information would outperform without? For example, if there are only a small number of nodes, then without the coordinate information the model will have difficulty identifying global distance structure of the graph? Clearer characterization of when one method will outperform another will be more insightful, rather than making a broad claim about the benefit of one method against another based on a particular favorable configuration.",

While this works does a more systematic study of the effect, I am not sure the presented work by itself is significant enough for ICLR. I am particularly concerned that relatively simple remedies to the problem (such as data augmentation or incorporating robustness requirements into training instance creation) were not explored, and also that authors only experiment with settings favorable to their proposed method. More systematic study of possible remedies and diverse experimental settings will strengthen the contribution of the paper.\n\nClarity: Main ideas of the paper was relatively easy to follow, but I had difficulties getting some details of the paper. For example, I don't think the supervision signal and the loss function for FPD model in Section 4.2 was discussed. Authors mention the goal is to imitate courier action, and cross-entropy loss could've been a straightforward choice of the loss, but these are worth mentioning. \n\nReproducibility: Synthetic data experiments would be easily reproduced, since authors build upon an existing open source project, and they promised to share results. Real data experiments shall not be reproduced, because they seem to be based on non-public data.",

They replace the input with two types: (1) the distance-based input and (2) the concatenation of the coordination input and distance-based input.
