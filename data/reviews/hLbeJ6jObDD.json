            "summary_of_the_paper": "In this paper the authors study collaborative exploration in kernel bandits. This problem is very general, and it generalizes a lot of works done in collaborative exploration. Due to the use of kernel, which allows non-linear structure of arms, it generalizes the works done on collaborative exploration in MAB and in linear bandits. Moreover, this work allows agents to collaborate on different tasks: the set of arms and the best arm are not necessary the same for each agent, as well as the features of arms.\nThe authors study the both exploration problems: fixed confidence and fixed budget. They propose and analyze an algorithm for each problem setting. They notably prove near optimal sample complexity and a near optimal number of communication rounds in the fixed confidence setting. Last but not least for the confidence setting, they provide a lower bound of the near optimal number of communication rounds that generalizes (Tao et al 2019) to structured rewards. Finally the same job is done for the fixed budget setting.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The studied problem is very general. The paper is technically sound. The analytical results are convincing.\n\nThe paper is quite difficult to read. This is largely due to the complexity of the studied problem. \nHowever, sometimes some notations are not well introduced. This complicates the task of the reader. For instance at the end of page 2 \\tilde{X} is the set of arms, while in page 3 X_v is also the set of arms for agent v. The reader learns at the end of page 3, what is the difference between \\tilde{X} and X, \\tilde{X} = Z x X, where Z is the task feature space\u2026\nIn Algorithm 1, the authors should emphasizes that t is not the standard time index, but the index of communication rounds. May be by simply writing line 3, for round r = 1,2,\u2026 do, could help the reader to understand the algorithm.\n\nThis paper has a lot of results, including some experiments, but only the analysis of fixed confidence exploration problem is in the main paper, without any experiment. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "On the novelty side, the paper generalizes some well-known problems. The idea of communication rounds is not new, but the authors add a specific and new kernelized estimator to reduce the dimension of sent messages. The communication lower bound for structured arms is new and general (it also holds at least for multi-armed bandits and linear bandits).",

Each agent may experience a varied environment (reward functions) because of the characteristics of kernel bandits.\n* Strong and comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided.\n\nWeaknesses\n* In contrast to CoPE, where the sample complexity is defined as the greatest number of samples used per agent, the purpose specified in this study is a little bit different. The sample complexity is defined in this study as the average number of samples across all agents, which makes the speed-up definition less strong than that in CoPE. Since the running duration is determined by the one running the longest, I believe the definition in CoPE is more reasonable practically.\n* It is better if the authors could put the experiment results in the main paper",

I am happy to raise my score if the author(s) could provide practical examples to motivate this goal.\n\nAfter rebuttal\n--------------------------\nThe author(s) have promised to include the discussions regarding the difference between the goal of this paper and that of CoPE, hence I would like to increase my score.",
