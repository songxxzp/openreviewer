The authors consider an iterative strategy for nodes changing features. An approximation learning algorithm is proposed to learn a robust classifier. The authors experiment on both synthetic 1d case and three real-world graph dataset.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n1. The authors study an interesting question to generalize the i.i.d assumption in strategic classification to graph neural networks.\n\nWeakness\n1. Several assumptions in the problem definition are too simplistic for practical usage. On the model side: (1) it assumes nodes can directly change its embedding instead of the features which is mostly not the case. (2) The assumption of linearity and only considering direct neighbors severely limits the expressibility of GNN. On the strategy side, though, assuming access to h is already a strong assumption. The access to features of all neighbors nodes is way too strong to be practical especially in multi-step updates. Also, the assumption that all nodes have the same incentive to move towards the same class is also limiting.\n2. The analysis framework of multi-step is not appropriate for the problem. It is much more natural to consider game-theoretical concepts like equilibrium. Several results from the analysis are straightforward. It would be very interesting to see results like convergence results to equilibrium etc. Also, the assumption to set gain as 2 if flipped is also arbitrary.\n3. The empirical evaluation uses different assumptions compared to previous model and analysis. Section 2 allows nodes to change features arbitrarily as long as it is smaller than the gain. However, Section 5.2 assumes a max distance which induces quite different behavior.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies strategic classification under graph neural networks. In the model of strategic user behavior, it is assumed that a user plays myopic best-response over a sequence of multiple update rounds. The myopic response mapping means that a user may move their reported features in the direction that best improves their classification outcome from the graph neural network model. Several results are then stated to demonstrate the basic properties of the myopic response model and the consequent dynamics.\n\nThen, the learning objective based on the myopic best response is optimized over multiple rounds. This optimization computes the approximately modified features after T rounds.\n\nEmpirical evaluation is provided to demonstrate different aspects of learning in the above setting. Several experiments are conducted on popular settings in the GNN literature, this includes the Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed datasets, trained with a simplified GCN architecture. The results show that by anticipating the strategic behavior of users in the GNN, the optimized graph neural network performs robustly against the naive baseline, which trains a GNN without accounting for any strategic behaviors.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper is generally well-written; the methods and the experiments are both clearly described. The experiments also provide clear evidence about the proposed method in the presence of strategic behaviors of users.\n\nOne question with the reported results (e.g., in table 1) is to what extent is the gap between robust and non-strategic performance necessary. Whereas for CiteSeer, there is only a 2% gap between the two settings; for Cora and PubMed, there are about 10% gap between the two settings. To what extent can we close the performance gap between the robust performance and the non-strategic performance?\n\nAnother question is to what extend do these results hold under architectural modifications\u2014e.g., suppose one changes the diffusion matrix in the GNN, would the same result still apply?",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "There is a github repo associated with the submission; so it is believable that the reported results can be reproduced by following the documentation there.\n\nStrategic classification is related to the study of game theory; in particular the proposed formulation of this work is very much inspired by an ITCS paper by Hardt et al. (2016). This paper follows the formulation of this paper and applies concepts such as myopic response in graph neural networks. From this perspective, this paper seems like a natural extension of Hard et al. (2016) to the context of GNNs.",

Then it incorporates such myopic behavior into an optimization procedure. Experiments verify the robustness of this optimization method. On the other hand, it remains unclear to what extend could one close the gap between robust and non-robust performance, and how general the reported result is (in the broader context of GNN literature).",

Specifically, they consider a linear graph-based classifier, which classifies each node in the graph based on the node embedding with a linear function. The node embedding of each node depends on the features of this node and also the features of its neighborhood. In the strategic classification setting, each user (node) can modify the features of this node to change the classification result. The strategic classification problem is to learn a linear graph-based classifier to minimize the misclassification loss under strategic behavior. \n\nThis paper shows that the inter-user dependency on the graph might be exploited by strategic users and cause a higher loss. They also propose a differential framework for strategically-robust learning of graph-based classifiers.  Their theoretical results and method are supported by experimental results.",

It seems properties in section 3.2 and the learning algorithm highly depend on that the classifier is linear. I understand that linear classifier is widely used in practice and more accessible as the first step toward this problem. \n2. At the beginning of section 3 and experiments, you normalize the weights such that the node embedding depends on one parameter $\\alpha$.

Users are assumed to make myopic decisions based on other users' previous behavior. The fact that one user's actions can impact predictions on other users introduces interesting dynamics on the collective behavior of users. Authors identify interesting properties of the dynamics with both mathematical analysis and numerical experiments. ",

It is realistic enough to motivate real-world scenarios like credit scoring for microlending. It is simple enough to allow interesting mathematical analysis and possible to be adapted for more complex problems. Authors made a good judgment balancing these considerations.\n\nBoth mathematical analysis and empirical analysis provide good insights into how GNN introduces dynamics to the collective behavior of users. On the other hand, neither mathematical analysis nor empirical analysis actually take the property of the graph into consideration. This is unfortunate, because for sure the characteristics of graphs would play a crucial role determining the dynamics. For example, if the graph is divided into components, no information shall propagate across components. Short-radius graphs would propagate changes faster than long-radius graphs. A central node (say, in terms of PageRank or other centrality metrics) would play a bigger role impacting the dynamics than peripheral nodes would. \n\nThe fact that users only make myopic decisions also make the problem less interesting. Users would not really take advantage of opportunities to \"collude\" with their neighbors. Given it is reasonable to assume users shall communicate their plans with their social network, the fact that this works stops at myopic model is disappointing.",
