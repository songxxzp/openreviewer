The extension to hedge against the misspecification of the mixture weights also supports that the framework is well-designed.\n4. The numerical experiments are convincing.\n\nWeakness:\nMy only comment is that some existing works should be cited:\n1. \"Distributionally robust multi-item newsvendor problems with multimodal demand distributions\" addresses a similar issue of uncertain mixture weights.\n2. \"Sharing the value-at-risk under distributional ambiguity\" also values the probability under distributional ambiguity around a reference Gaussian distribution.",

If I didn't understand wrongly, the baseline AR and Wachter has better ( smaller ) $\\ell_1$ cost than the proposed DiRRAc or Gaussian DiRRAc?

Future model shifts are modeled by considering all distributions close to the initial distribution, called the ambiguity set. The paper proposes a minimax problem where inner max is over the ambiguity set and min is over possible counterfactuals. By choosing Gelbrich distance, the optimization problem is shown to be solvable, and the paper proposes a Projected GD algorithm.

I am not sure if ROAR could have achieved similar M2 validity results with different \\Delta, but figure 3 seems to show DiRRAc consistently achieves lower cost recourses\n\n\n- DiRRAc is not the best performing method (in M2 validity) for non linear models, which are usually the ones deployed, since it relies on the local linear approximation \n- How can the initial distribution parameters be computed for classifiers which already exist? \n- How is \\rho_k determined? Ideally, we want to have a larger ball if we expect the model to change significantly. Is there a guideline for this?\n- How costly is the projection step?
