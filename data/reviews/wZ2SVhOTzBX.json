            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper explores conditioning on image annotation labelling style, to reduce aleatoric uncertainty relating to the segmentation of objects in medical images. In particular, the general problem of uncertainty estimation for segmentation assumes that the annotation is drawn from an unknown annotator distribution, p(a|x) where a represents the (unknown) annotator, and x is the image. The main contribution then is the proposal to also condition on (discrete) label style l, i.e. p(a|x,l), where the label style is known. This label conditioning is implemented into two segmentation models, the (conditioned) probabilistic U-Net (CPUN), and the conditioned stochastic segmentation network (CSSN), such that both models can condition their predictions on any label style used in training. Experiments on two datasets (ISIC, PhC-U373) suggest that such conditioning results in improved segmentation performance (as measured by IoU), whether compared to training using all available labels (regardless of label style, without conditioning), or using only annotations of the same label style (thus losing information possibly obtainable from the other label styles).\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n1. The proposed label style conditioning method allows information on annotation style to be exploited, in segmentation tasks. Moreover, as coarse segmentations are (possibly greatly) less time-consuming for human graders to produce, the method may greatly reduce human effort, for large performance gains.\n\n2. Two model architectures are implemented, and experiments are exhaustively performed over combinations of training and testing data subsets, each containing one or all label styles.\n\n3. The distribution of overestimations/uncertainties are well-illustrated in suitable figures.\n\nPossible Weaknesses/Considerations:\n\n4. A major practical consideration about the proposed method, is the requirement for the label style to be known. For the experiments studied in this work, the datasets have annotations in prior-defined styles (e.g. Figure 2), which are then separately evaluated on as subsets each containing annotations of a single style. It might firstly be informative to evaluate performance where the annotation style is not a priori known.\n\n5. Related to the above, coarse annotations (e.g. Label Styles 1 & 2 in Figure 2) appear to be automatically obtainable from detailed annotations (Label Style 0), using some basic image processing operations (e.g. dilation, then smoothing of the boundary). If so, this may suggest that the coarse annotations actually do not really provide any (significant) new information, and it is possible that with just the detailed annotations for each image, coarse annotations can be generated and used as the additional coarse annotations for the proposed conditional learning. This would however then fall into the (common) use of dynamic augmentation (e.g. minor rotation/scaling, elastic deformation etc.) preprocessing of the image & annotation labels, in training deep learning classification/segmentation models.\nGiven this, it might be appropriate to explore whether automatically-generated coarse segmentations are sufficient to replicate the performance gain currently observed with manually-annotated coarse segmentations. If so, this would further inform on the actual source of the performance gain, and further reduce human annotation burden.\n\n6. Still related to the above, while area bias (and possibly other bias) is observed (Section 5.1), it is not clear the extent to which such bias has been attempted to be mitigated, particularly using the validation data. It is mentioned in Section 4.1 that the datasets have 20% of image-annotation pairs reserved as validation data, but it is not clear how this validation data has been used. It might be expected for area (and other) bias to be mitigated, by optimizing hyperparameters such as the pixel threshold (apparently a default threshold of 0.5 is mentioned in Section 5.3) used to separate the object from the background. This might be clarified.\n\n7. The \u201cpixel-wise entropy\u201d referred to in Section 5.3 might be explicitly defined (possibly in the appendix), for completeness.\n\n8. Theoretically, the formulation p(a|x,l) appears to still place emphasis on annotator distribution, while it might be supposed that inter-annotator label differences would be insignificant compared to inter-style label differences. This might be discussed.\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The background and theory is generally clearly written and easy to follow. The primary proposal of conditioning on style labels may not be entirely novel, but remains well-motivated and executed. The implementation of the proposed conditioning involves adding the label style variable to defined inputs of previously-described models, which should be replicable. However, some clarifications might remain on the exact training and hyperparameter optimization procedure (if any).\n",
            "summary_of_the_review": "A label style conditioning is proposed and implemented in two previously-described deep neural network-based image segmentation models, which exhibits improved performance on two datasets compared to the same models without conditioning. However, some issues may remain with whether the comparisons are fully fair and whether apparent bias has been attempted to be mitigated with more conventional and common techniques, as detailed in the Strength and Weaknesses section.\n",
