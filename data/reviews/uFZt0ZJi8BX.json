The model first extracts global features from a partial input, then produces a coarse point cloud which is fed to several blocks in a sequential manner, each increasing the number of output points and modifying them. Overall, architecture heavily relies on the use of restricted local self-attention and multi-scale feature processing.\n\nArchitecture is evaluated on PCN and MVP datasets and compared to a large list of recent related models showing performance exceeding state of the art. Additionally, the authors provide several ablation studies, evaluating the performance of various model components; and compare their model in terms of memory footprint and computational efficiency.",

            "summary_of_the_review": "Given overall quality of the submission including detailed introduction of the model, extensive experiments with two benchmarks and various ablation studies, and the resulting state-of-the-art performance, I think this paper is a good candidate for acceptance, even if the novelty of the approach is limited.

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1) GANet achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PCN and MVP datasets.\n\nWeakness:\n1) Lack of clarity: \n\n1.1) In Section 3.1, the input to Local Edge Aggregator (LEA) is defined as P\u2019 (Nx3) and F\u2019 (NxD). While in Figure 2-left, the input becomes P (NxC) and F is missing. The symbols used in Figure-2 left and right are also inconsistent. \n\n1.2) In Section 3.1 Para. 1, \u201cwe use a different definition of edge\u201d, what is this definition?\n\n1.3) In Section 3.1, \u201cwe define K1, K2, K3 as 10, 20, N respectively\u201d, what is N?\n\n1.4) In Section 3.2, \u201cthe input of DPA is the point cloud Pi (Mx3)\u201d, then what are the input point features? \n\n1.5) Connection between Section 3.1 and 3.2 is missing. It is difficult for readers to understand the complete pipeline of the proposed method.\n\n1.6) Symbols are also inconsistent between Section 3.1 and 3.2. \n\n\n2) Lack of clear motivation:\n\n2.1) The paper claims \u201cPrior PointNet-based methods can hardly learn geometric information as they learn the global and local features from individual points\u201d (Section 3.1) and \u201cThey (prior methods) usually employ MLPs-based feature extractor to learn the features of input, which may fail to exploit the geometric and structural features of the input\u201d (Section 3.2) as the motivations of the proposed GANet. More in-depth analysis about the drawback of MLP-based feature extractor and the advantage of GANet is expected. Otherwise, the proposed method is not convincing. A simple quantitative comparison in Table 3 seems not enough.\n\n2.2) It\u2019s hard to find the relation between GANet and \u201cgraph-aware\u201d. In its core graph-based Local Edge Aggregator (LEA), the operations shown in Equations (1) & (2) seem no difference from MLP-based paradigm.\n\n\n3) Originality:\nThe core graph-based Local Edge Aggregator (LEA) is not novel. The paper does not clarify the definition of \u201cedge\u201d in this part, but:\n--> If the \u201cedge\u201d is defined in Euclidean space of raw points, there is no difference from PointConv [1].\n--> If the \u201cedge\u201d is defined in feature space, there is no difference from RandLA-Net [2].\n\n[1] W.
