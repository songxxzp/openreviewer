            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors argue that 1D time series data are composed of multiple intraperiod-variations and interperiod-variations. Since there is a limit to capturing these variations as 1D time series representation, the authors transform the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods so that the analysis can be performed in a 2D space. The proposed method can adaptively discover multi-periodicity and extract complex temporal changes from 2D tensors. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short-term prediction, long-term prediction, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength:\n1. The proposed method solves the bottleneck of representation capability in 1D space and enables simultaneous representation of intra-period and inter-period variation in 2D space. While 1D time series could only represent variations between temporally adjacent time points, the proposed method offers the possibility of representing variations of the same phase in different periods. As the result, the proposed method allows the 2D kernel to simultaneously handle changes in adjacent time and changes between adjacent periods.\n\n2. Good design for flexibility. The inception block can be replaced by any model of the type that uses a 2D kernel. In fact, the authors investigated its performance by replacing the inception block by other models such as ResNet and ResNeXt, etc. \n\n3. The proposed method provides SOTA performance in five main tasks in time-series data analysis. While the models of previous studies differ in their strengths in each task, the proposed method almost consistently performs the best.\n\n\nConcerns:\n1. What does the dimension \u201cC\u201d of time series data correspond to in this study?\n\n2. According to the appendix, the top-k was experimentally decided to be three (k=3). As far as I see the Fig.8, the performance was not so changed in the range between 1 and five. How carefully should the parameter k be decided? If a larger k is selected, is there any possibility to increase/decrease the performance?\n\n3. Small concern. I found a paper, which has already submitted in Arxiv. The contents of both papers are almost same except for author area: one is anonymized, the other shows the author list. I hope this doesn't violate the double blind rule.",

The inception block can be easily replaced by other existing models so that its flexibility is also high.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper focuses on modeling the temporal variations in the time series data. Specifically, based on the observation that there are often multiple periodicities in time series data, the paper proposes to divide a single multi-dimensional time series into several sets of smaller pieces of the time series, each with a different periodicity. Then, the inner-period variance and intra-period variance could be modeled together with a CNN backbone, like inception as used in this paper. Empirical evaluations are conducted with multiple datasets on forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection tasks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n\n- The idea of tackling the long-term dependency by utilizing the multiple periodicities in time series is reasonable and the use of FFT to extract the period from the frequency domain also makes sense.\n- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive and promising results are shown.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n- The periodicity in time series is an important assumption in this paper. Some time series data are not strictly periodic, but instead, they are composed of several repeating segments. In such cases, it is not clear if the proposed method still works.\n- It is not clear if the proposed model can be applied to a dataset containing multiple datasets but with different period lengths for each data sample. For example, the time series data for patients in hospitals.\n\n\nA minor detail: In the line before Eq. (1), \"Fast Fourier Transformer (FFT)\" should be \"Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\".",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "In terms of clarity, the paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The proposed model uses FFT to identify periodicity and uses 2D vision backbones like inception to model the temporal dependency. Although both techniques are not novel, the idea of combining them to better utilize the multiple periodicities in time series to improve downstream task performance is reasonable and well executed in this paper. The paper discussed the implementation details and hyperparameter settings in appendices, so I personally believe the paper should be reproducible given that the source codes will be released.",
