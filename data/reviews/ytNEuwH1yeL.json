            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors propose an approach for experiment design in context of qMRI studies. The new approach combines feature selection and the choice of tasks in an integrated solution, using a combination of two neural networks.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The approach is very well motivated for the qMRI application where the effect of different acquisition parameters is reflected in a different manner in each voxel\n- Works well in several experiments\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The method explicitly relies on densely sampled super-design and access to ground truth labels for 'the task driving the ED'. While the authors explain why we can satisfy these assumptions in the specific case of qMRI, I cannot identify other common scenarios where we would meet these criteria and the goal would be to find an 'economical design' for the same task. This severely limits the value of the work for general AI audiences\n- The paper is presented strongly from the perspective of the application (as it needs to be because the details rely on the assumptions that hold for this application) and would better fit a more specialised venue.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The paper presents a practical solution for designing qMRI, but unfortunately I do not see significant contributions for the AI literature in general. While the basic idea of simultaneously optimizing for the features and the experimental design is reasonable, the actual solution requires access to data that corresponds to essentially having already solved the problem. The authors explain well why this data can be obtained in the specific case of qMRI and the work is hence clearly publishable, but I do not think ICLR is the right venue for such a specialised application. The bare minimum would be to explain a few other examples where obtaining a super-design that densely covers the samples together with target labels that correspond to the same task is realistic and the actual goal is to obtain an economical design, and then re-write the paper using a more general terminology. I can think of some possible examples at least in inverse modelling, but the authors should be much more detailed in justifying the relevance of the problem formulation in general.\n\nThe other main problem is that the method description is very shallow. Section 3 takes less than a page, the paper has no formal description of the model but only explains it in Figure 1 (which cannot be understood in detail as some symbols are not even defined), and there are no justifications for any of the choices; the algorithm is simply explained to consist of an outer an inner loop, with no discussion on why it has to be done like this. In technical terms, the solution looks like a specific neural network architecture with fairly standard training algorithm.\n\nThe empirical experiments are good, but quite specialised for the application domain. They certainly warrant publishing the work in a suitable venue.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "A novel and potentially interesting model for setting the configuration of qMRI devices, but the paper does not feel like a good fit for ICLR since the method makes assumptions that are not easy to satisfy in general cases and the method presentation is not detailed enough.

It all depends on the overall objective, and if both ED and FS share the same objective, they should favor the same/similar set of features. And how are those properties distinct/different? \nWhile it is encouraging that JOFSTO is outperforming Lee at al. (2022) and Wojtas & Chen (2020) approaches, it is peculiar that random FS + DL is also outperforming them (Table 5.). Appears that somehow informed feature selection, during the network training, is actually hurting the performance. Can it be that some sort of overfitting is behind such results?\nAblation study (Table 6.) suggests that Recursive Feature Elimination is not bringing that much performance improvement. Is the RFE step necessary then?\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new method for \"experiment design (ED)\" by jointly performing feature selection and task optimization.\nThe performance of the proposed method, called JOFSTO, has been evaluated based on applications in Quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI), where the evaluation results show that JOFSTO outperforms other existing schemes/baselines under a number of scenarios.\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "OVERALL COMMENTS\n\nThe main strength of the work lies in the overall performance gain achieved by JOFSTO in qMRI applications - in terms of improved parameter estimation, enhanced reconstruction performance, and more accurate quantification of tissue microstructure.\nWhile the proposed method itself strongly builds on existing work - especially,  Wojtas & Chen (2020) that utilizes dual feature scoring and task prediction networks - and the underlying idea is relatively simple, the performance evaluation results show that it nevertheless has potential benefits in qMRI analysis.\n\nHowever, the literary and technical presentations in the paper leave much room for improvement.\nSeveral important details for understanding the proposed methodology are missing or unclear, and the authors often refer to examples without first explaining their relevance and some notations without providing a clear definition.\n\nFurthermore, the proposed work appears to be motivated by a very specific application (i.e., ED for qMRI acquisition parameter optimization), and it is unclear whether JOFSTO would be applicable to other experiment design problems beyond qMRI applications considered in this study.\n\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\n1. Considering that the proposed work is focused on a very specific application and problem setting, this should be more clearly reflected in the title and abstract.\n\n2. Experimental design is a widely studied topic across various disciplines, while the authors seem to be mostly focused on \"experiment design\" in qMRI applications.\nHowever, \"ED in qMRI\" seems to be quite different from what is typically referred to \"experimental design\" or \"optimal experiment design (OED)\" in various other fields, and this may potentially lead to confusion for readers.\nIt would be important to provide a more general treatment of the OED problem in the introduction or background and then zoom into this more specific ED problem in qMRI to avoid any confusion.\n\nHere are a few relevant references:\n\nLindley, Dennis Victor.

The authors mention certain problems/applications - seemingly not closely related to the current work - without providing any context. Some examples include:\n\"e.g. selecting protein expressions for classification\" (in the abstract)\n\"unlike for example protein-coding genes 10x Genomics (2022) or noisy two-moons data Scikit-Learn (2022)\" (page 1/2)\n\"genes 10x Genomics (2022) or noisy two-moons data Scikit-Learn (2022)\" (page 3)\n\" e.g. noisy two-moons dataset.\" (page 3)\nShould the authors want to keep these examples, their relevance should be first clearly explained.\n\n4. In Section 2 \"Related Work\", the cardinality C of the set A need to be clearly defined.\nFor example, later in the paper C is used to refer to measurements or number of channels, but it would be better to provide a clear yet general definition first and then give specific examples in the current setting (e.g., qMRI application)\n\n5. The subsampling strategy for selecting C out of \\bar{C} should be better explained. \nFor example, JOFSTO is said to \"progressively\" construct m_t to have C_t ones, but how is this precisely achieved?\nDoes each step t -> t+1 reduce the C_t by a fixed number? (e.g. removal of a single feature) Or can it be variable?\n\n6. Furthermore, it is not clear how the feature scores quantify the relative importance of the available features and rank them.\nThis is central to JOFSTO to improve ED performance, and this needs to be clearly elaborated.\nEspecially, clearly explanation is needed regarding how the task at hand informs this scoring process to make the joint feature selection and task optimization work.\n\n7. On page 2, it is ambiguous what the authors are referring to as \"circularity\" and how the proposed subsampling-task paradigm for ED avoid this issue.\nPlease clarify.\n\n8. While the authors mention \"studying the size and diversity of densely sampled data needed to ensure strong generalizable design\" as future work, there should be at least some empirical evaluations on the minimum C needed to attain a certain level of performance for the task at hand.\nLet's denote this C as C_min.\nIt would be meaningful to understand the performance of JOFSTO (and any under/overfitting of the optimized network models) when C (<C_min) is much smaller than needed or when C (>C_min) is unnecessarily large, at least empirically.\nBased on this, prescribing a general guideline for deciding the optimal value of C would be practically important.\n\n\n\n",
