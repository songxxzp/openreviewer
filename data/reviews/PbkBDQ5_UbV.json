In this setting, the dataset is generated by a state depending policy, while the learner can only get access to observation. Based on some additional assumptions about negative control, bridge functions and concentrability coefficient and etc, the authors proposed a minimax approach to estimate policy value and a pessimism algorithm called P3O to identify near-optimal policy with bounded sub-optimality gap.",

The authors introduced the ideas of their methods very clearly and make this paper easy to follow although mathematically heavy. Although using pessimism is not a surprising idea for offline learning in POMDP, there are still some novelty and interesting parts in this paper.\n\n### Weakness\n\nThis paper is limited to the setting with latent states.\n\nThe learning framework (i.e. solving the bridge function for policy value estimation and using pessimism for policy learning so that sub-opt gap can be bounded via coverge w.r.t. optimal policies) is not something new and well-studied in previous literatures (although in different settings, the techniques and ideas are similar). So I'm feeling the novelty is kind of just above the marginal level.\n\nAlgorithm seems not computationally efficient.",

Specifically, data generation policy (or behavioral policy) is assumed to access the latent states while the target policy cannot, and the dataset does not contain trajectories of latent states. Basic idea is to combine the notion of bridge functions first proposed for the off-policy evaluation in POMDPs (e.g., Uehara et al., 2021), and the pessimism principle for offline RL which has gained a lot of attention recently. \n\nIn general, offline RL is intractable in POMDPs. To make the problem tractable, the paper assumes that additional observations (Z and W) are supplied such that short snapshots of trajectories satisfy a certain rank sufficiency assumption (e.g., weak-observability, Liu et al., 2022), under which the existence of bridge functions is known to be guaranteed. Under such conditions, the authors develop a simple offline RL algorithm and provide a polynomial upper bound under some additional assumptions. \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "*Strength*\n\n- The paper tackles an important and challenging problem. Up to my best knowledge, this is the earliest kind of results that gives provable guarantees for offline RL in POMDPs. \n\n- The construction of confidence intervals around bridge functions, and analysis involving it, seems new. \n\n\n\n*Weakness*\n\n- Additional observations (Z and W) are somewhat non-standard and unjustified. Why couldn\u2019t them be just a part of observations from the beginning?\n\n- This paper mostly uses the notions and assumptions defined in previous works. While related works are properly cited, they are hard to parse in general and would have been nicer if the paper has its own interpretation and intuition. For instance, the dependency of \\epsilon_B^{1/4} in the final result seems quite arbitrary. It\u2019s not clear what it even means. \n\n- Related, coverage coefficient is defined in terms of $q_h^\\pi$. How this can be interpreted in tabular settings, or in fully observable setting (a.k.a. MDP)? Such explanations could be helpful for readers. \n\n- From a technical writing perspective, it is quite hard to follow. e.g., I cannot understand - how the construction of a confidence set is more challenging than standard problems? what is the intuition behind the construction and how do we expect it to give us polynomial bound? etc.",
