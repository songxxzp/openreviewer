The authors have chosen their problem well if the aim is to quickly produce something of practical use for drug discovery.  Linker design is a real task in the drug discovery process, it is constrained enough to do well, and existing ML models for the purpose have limitations that the new model addresses.\n\nWhy did the authors choose to train a conditional generator on fragmented molecules, rather than training a model to denoise entire molecules and treating conditional generation as an inpainting task?\n\nThe generated molecules in figure 2 look odd e.g. they contain 3, 4, and 7-member rings. Do you get better molecules after some simple post-filtering? Also in this figure, the bonds in the input fragments and true molecule do not look correct.\n\nIn table 1, please add the QED, SA and #rings scores for the ZINC, CASF and GEOM training data as well as the generated molecules.\n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper studied the problem of molecular linker generation, which aims to generate the linker given different individual fragments of a desired molecule/drug. Specifically, the work borrows the idea of the recent equivariant diffusion molecule generative model [1] into this specific \"molecular missing part\" generation problem. Experiments on several human-designed datasets show that the proposed method is competitive or better than existing methods.\n\n[1] Emiel Hoogeboom, V\u0131ctor Garcia Satorras, Clement Vignac, and Max Welling. Equivariant diffusion for molecule generation in 3d. In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 8867\u20138887. PMLR, 2022.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "[Strength]:\n\n1. The paper is well organized. The tackled linker generation scenario is clearly defined, and the method is easy to follow and understand.\n2. The author nicely provides the source code.\n3. The benchmark table's numerical results are superior to existing methods.\n\n[Weakness]\n\n1. Overall, the paper is not surprising to me. From the ML perspective, this work is an incremental adoption of the equivariant diffusion model in the context of linker design, without significant technical challenges.\n2. Besides, actually diffusion models itself has the capacity for \"inpainting\" missing parts. As shown in the original diffusion model paper [1], the diffusion model can naturally recover the missing patches of images. This further indicates this \"linker design\" is a natural and simple usage of existing diffusion models for molecule generation, making the technical contribution limited.\n3. I'm also a little doubtful about the experimental setup. From the domain-specific (biological or chemical) perspective, considering we already have several fragments and want to design the linker for them: why for the different disconnected fragments we can know their relative positions and even exact coordinates before generating the linker (as shown in Fig.1). I think for this linker design problem, we should take these fragments' positions as known, which, however, is even treated as rigid bodies in this paper.\n4. I'm also concerned about the \"reflection\" equivariance imposed on the proposed model. According to my knowledge, the energy of reflected biostructures should be different, which means they shouldn't have reflection symmetry. However, this is not the case for the proposed model.\n5. [minor point] Considering this is an application paper, actually I'm not sure whether the evaluation itself is sound. For the dataset part, the data is obtained by manually subtracting fragments from molecular structure datasets. This makes me feel like the benchmark itself is human-designed and far away from real-world challenges. I understand this setup may be already adopted in a few existing benchmarks, but this doesn't mean we can just follow them despite the limitation in existing benchmarks. Maybe better and more realistic benchmarks can also be introduced.\n\n[1] Ho, Jonathan, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel. \"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 6840-6851.",
