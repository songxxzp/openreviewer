Prior works address this by assigning different weight to different instances according to their importance. However, this has not been well extended to multi-class classification scenario, where the instance could be closed to the intersection of multiple class boundaries. In this work, larger weight is assigned to these examples and better suit for multi-class classification. However, the experiment does not demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Take the bottom block of Table 1 for example. When comparing WMMR with Ours+WMMR, we can see that the proposed method is almost the same as the prior work (some of them is even worse). This conclusion also holds both Cifar10 and Cifar100 dataset (Table 1 and Table 2). This conclude that the proposed method is not working. The author is suggested to provide more convincing results to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n(2).\tTable 3 shows completely different trend when \\tau increases from 2 to 4. For APGD-CE, the accuracy of Cifar10 improves when \\tau increases, while the accuracy of Cifar100 degrades when \\tau increases. This shows that the conclusion is inconsistent between 2 datasets.

What is the main difference between the proposed margin reweighting method and the baseline? Why do instances closer to the intersection of the decision boundaries require larger weight values? How does the instance close to the intersection of the decision boundaries with a large weight value improve robustness?\n\n-The experimental results are pessimistic. AA is currently the most reliable robustness evaluation method. The proposed method has no improvement in AA, but it has declined compared to baselines. Therefore, I am concerned that the method proposed in this paper has no substantial robustness improvement.\n\n-There are some vague statements, such as:\n\u201cAlthough GAIRAT achieves better robustness than standard AT, it is vulnerable against attacks other than PGD because it defines the importance in terms of the LPS.\u201d\nFirst, AA is currently the most reliable robustness evaluation method, and the robustness of GAIRAT is much lower than that of standard AT. Second, CE loss is invariant to shifts of the logits but not to rescaling [1,2]. Is the robustness of GAIRAT significantly reduced due to the amplitude of its scaling?

Especially, it is unclear why the suggested weight equation could be a better standard for instance reweighted adversarial training.\n- Based on the performance, I am not sure it is adequate to claim that the suggested weight equation helps to improve the robustness against AutoAttack. In ResNet18 and CIFAR10/CIFAR100, reweighting does not show any effectiveness. In larger architecture, the proposed method could not improve the previous margin based reweighting both in CIFAR10 and CIFAR100.\n- If the margin equation is the limitation to representing the multi-class margins, it seems better to use entropy as a standard.\n\n**Minor**\n- There is no explanation for M in equation 12.",

However, the paper explains their approach with a redundant equation for their simple approaches which weighs more on the incorrect rate based on the margin equation that is suggested in the previous works.\n\n**Quality:** The presentation of the paper seems fine. However, since the proposed approach could be adjusted in WMMR and MAIL, I hope the authors rearrange rows of table 1 and table 2 as follows which could show the performance gain more effectively. (Standard / WMMR / WMMR + Ours / MAIL / MAIL + Ours)\n\n**Novelty:** The idea and approach seem has a lack novelty. Since the previous works already suggest the main idea of instance-reweighting in adversarial training based on the margin, additional weights (incorrectness) on the previous equation seem highly related to me.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper has well reproducibility which elaborates well on the details.",
