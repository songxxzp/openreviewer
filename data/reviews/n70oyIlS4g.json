            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a large-scale product dataset containing a lot of object properties such as listing text, mass, price, product ratings, and 182 material classes. The detailed collecting and implementation processes are given. Besides, a human-in-the-loop annotation system is proposed to actively add new attributes to the objects of the dataset. Given this labeling system, the authors show interesting additional annotation processes to add new attributes and verify the annotation quality quantitatively.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pros:\n+ An extensive large-scale dataset that would be useful for many directions and studies.\n\n+ The data selection and annotation processes are described detailedly which would help the readers to use this dataset and enlarge it.\n\n+ Considering the \"materials that are not necessarily visible on the surface of an object, such as copper inside a wire\", this is very interesting and would be inspiring for future works.\n\nCons:\n- Lacking discussion about the object attribute datasets and methods (MIT-States, UT-Zap, etc.) though not all these works are related to products and are typically designed for common objects (but have some material attributes).\n\n- Lacking discussion about compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) which is very related to this work, especially for adding new attributes to objects (attribute-object compositions).\n\n- It would be better to give a detailed bias analysis of the dataset itself and the annotation process. Because the authors use a lot of automatically labeling methods adopting DNN models. Moreover, the effect of longtail distribution is another important factor to analyze for both training and downstream applications.\n\n- A list of data license and availability analysis?\n\n- Though the proposed smart labeling system makes sense, the whole method designs are mainly common practices.\n\n- It would be more solid to give a comprehensive analysis of the data quality verification as many labels are got not done manually (a clear ratio of pseudo labels).\n\n- Lacking enough details of the models and experiments such as hyperparameters: \n\nHowever, missing attributes can be accurately inferred from the available attributes: how accurate?\n\nWhen precision and positive rate are sufficiently high: how much?\n\n- \"Even though Product Type and Category are both semantic classifications of the objects, they have surprisingly little overlap. Preliminary experiments show that models trained to predict one don\u2019t benefit much from the inclusion of the other as an input\": why?\n\n- typo: we use uncertainty sampling(Lewis & Gale, 1994)\uff1a sampling (...)\n\n- fig 7: explain what attribute is being labeled.",

However, some details are missing, especially for the model illustration and experiments (hyperparameters, training, inference, etc.)\n\nQuality: Well.\n\nNovelty: a new and useful dataset that would be impactful for the community\n\nReproducibility: many details of the dataset construction process are given. However, more need to be confirmed and checked during use.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this work proposes a large-scale dataset that would be useful for future works. Besides, the labeling process makes sense and achieves reasonable quality as shown in the paper. However, a lot of details and explanations are missing to make this dataset paper more solid.
