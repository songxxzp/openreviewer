            "summary_of_the_paper": "The manuscript proposes a novel approach for OOD detection based on two branches. One branch operates on DFT coefficients and the other on pixels. The pixel branch combines A ResNet-18 backbone, a multi-SVDD [ghafoori20icdm] layer initialized with unit centers, and a normalizing flow. The frequency branch is directly evaluated by a normalizing flow. The authors argue that the pixel branch is suitable for detecting semantic OODs, while the frequency branch is suitable for texture OODs. \n\n",

Competitive performance with respect to approaches that train with class labels (Table C.1) on very small images.\n3. Initialization at the unit sphere and disentanglement loss appear to help (Table 6)\n\nWeaknesses\n\n1. \\lambda=1.0 wins in almost all conventional OOD experiments (Table 1). The exception is C10-LSUN*. However, this result does not repeat in Table C.1 where \\lambda=1 is better than \\lambda=0 in both C10-LSUN configurations. If \\lambda=1.0 always wins, then the contribution of the texture branch is unclear.\n2. Table 6 does not reveal \\lambda; it should be performed for all three values of \\lambda\n3. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 have shared and related classes (dog - wolf, cat - tiger etc); this is not a suitable pair for OOD detection.\n4. OOD detection on small images has been largely solved (Table C.1). Further work should evaluate on tougher benchmarks such as Species, SMIYC or FIshyscapes. \n5. The distinction between anomalies and OOD samples does not reflect the current usage in the community. For instance, UCSD anomaly detection dataset [a] contains OOD objects. A recent review explicitly states that anomalies, outliers and novelties are synonyms but distinguishes low-level and high-level anomalies [b].\n6.

The main difference is that [c] uses labels while the present approach appears to use a form of self-training.\n\nUnit centers appear related to [d].   \n\nDetecting semantic OOD samples with a convolutional model is not easy due to texture bias [e,f].

In fact most texture segmentation methods I am aware of don't use frequency based features.\n2) In principle if frequency components are indeed important for the OOD data, we should be able to learn it with a neural network.

Empirically, it seems to work well enough, but a more sophisticated set of features may improve performance. Does the process make use of an integral image to do the computation of rectangular sums? It's also not clear if the computation is being done on the base DFT or the power spectrum. The text for figure 4 implies it is the power spectrum.\n\nThe acronym SVDD does not seem to be defined in the text.\n\nThe balance of the two systems is evaluated at only lambda = {0, 0.5, and 1}.
