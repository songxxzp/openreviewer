            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper theoretically studies dynamic benchmarking. Given that static datasets raise various concerns when used as ML benchmarks, dynamic benchmarks are proposed by researchers. In this setting, the ML model is trained against the current dataset, while the next dataset will contain new data points chosen to challenge previously built models. The main question is whether one can design such dynamic benchmarks so that the model's performance will improve as more and more difficult instances are added to the dataset. The authors provide a theoretical model for this problem and prove some negative and positive results, which are presented in the next section.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper first introduces the natural and intuitive path dynamic benchmarking architecture and provides the following results: in the realizable setting under the proposed  sequential architecture, it is shown that the trained model will get $O(\\epsilon^2)$ error in 3 rounds and there is an $\\Omega(\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for any larger number of rounds. Namely, there is no provable benefit to dynamic data collection beyond 3 rounds in the path model. The authors also show some negative results when one has label noise.\n\nMoreover, since the above sequential model has provable limitations, it is asked whether there exist different ways to design dynamic benchmarking architectures. In particular, a \u201chierarchical\u201d model is proposed that achieves error $O(\\epsilon^3)$ when used with depth 2.\n\nI find this paper extremely interesting. I really enjoyed reading the paper and I believe that the result constitutes an important contribution to learning theory. At a technical level, the lower bound for the path dynamic model is very nice and perhaps surprising. The paper is clearly written and the problem and results are clearly organized.\n\nI would like to conclude with some questions for the authors: \n\nQ1. In Theorem 3.5, the statement says that there exists a sequence of classifiers that is consistent but whose weighted majority has high error. Is it possible to lower bound the probability of observing such a bad sequence?\n\nQ2. Is it possible to extend the negative result for any Boolean function (in particular, Boolean functions that could potentially satisfy a variant of Proposition 3.2)?\n",

For the model where data collection and model fitting alternate sequentially, the authors show the model performance improves initially but can stall after only three rounds for the commonly used path dynamic benchmarking. The authors propose a new model with a hierarchical dependency structure to circumvent this issue. The authors prove the proposed model enjoys a better theoretical guarantee than the former one, albeit with a significant increase in complexity. The empirical results support the theoretical analysis well.",

As mentioned in the introduction, the dynamic benchmark is proposed to address the limitation of the static benchmark. But, a clear definition of the static benchmark and the motivation to study it is not provided in the paper. The authors have provided some references, but I think it would be better to at least include some basic definitions to make the paper self-containedness.\n\n- About the ability of the annotator: this paper assumes that annotators can access the conditional density of the misclassified instance over the unknown underlying distribution $\\mathcal{D}$. When is this assumption satisfied? If $\\mathcal{D}$ is accessible, why do the annotators not just collect the data at once? It would be nice if the authors could provide some practical examples.\n\n- About the related work: I think It would be nice to provide some discussion on the difference between active learning since both work aim to improve the data collection efficiency to improve the model's performance on a fixed unknown distribution. \n\n- Is there any theoretical result for the general depth-$k$ structure? Can this hierarchical structure continuously improve performance with deeper layers or stall with a certain depth?\n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- Clarity: the paper is generally well-structured, but some parts are still unclear to me (please see the first point of weakness for more details).\n- Quality: the theorems seem correct.
