The analysis on different types of feedback relies on much knowledge about the congestion game. Basically, these types are strongly related to congestion games.

However, it is not obvious to me how easy is for such assumptions to be true in practice. More specifically, it would be nice to provide (even at an intuitive level) data collection strategies that will satisfy such assumptions. Unless I am missing some details, I think this would be a very nice addition to the paper.\n- No experiments are performed to illustrate the developed technique and how such bounds translate into practice.",

The major technical tool used in the paper is a meta-result (Theorem 1 in the paper) from Cui & Du (2022b), which reduces the problem to the one of designing a bonus function. The author proposes several coverage conditions on the exploration policy so that the meta algorithm from Cui & Du (2022b) learns the Nash equilibrium of the congestion game. Some coverage conditions are complemented with impossibility results to justify the imposing of such conditions.",

The authors examine 3 different models, one with access to the costs of individual facilities, one with access to agent level costs, and one with access to the sum of agents' costs. The required assumptions depend on the information encompassed in the dataset, and stronger assumptions are naturally required when less information is provided. \n",

This is a highly non-standard assumption in congestion games/game theory. Is this assumption necessary for these proofs or is there a workaround? \n2) Various parts of the paper need more clarification or/and notational precision. For example, what is $n$ in Assumption 2? Do we assume that the condition holds for some $n$ or all possible $n$? Of course, the following paragraph clarifies the issue, but the assumption is not self-explanatory.\n3) The lack of experimental results is disappointing. Although this work is theoretical, it should be relatively easy to add experimental results showing how close the theoretical bound is to the actual gap. \n4) Even in the toy examples provided, adding the actual scale of the required data would be very beneficial, even if just for clarity. For example, in Figure 1, what is the actual number of data required to determine this equilibrium?\n\n",
