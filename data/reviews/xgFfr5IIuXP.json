The approach is demonstrated on three data sets; two synthetic and one real-world. The approach is compared to step-wise models which first cluster and then order, as well as some additional method proposed by the authors which extend the set-to-sequence architecture. Performance is measured using V-measure and Kendall's rank correlation. \n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The proposed method builds on state-of-the art methods for reasoning over sets using neural architectures. \nHowever, the end result has quite a lot of machinery, as illustrated in Figure 2. This makes it unclear which components may or may not be important for overall performance. Some ablation experiments are warranted. Can some elements of the model be removed or replaced with trivial stand-ins? How would this effect performance?\n\nThe notion of previous clusters are mentioned a few times. Where do these come from? Are they the training data? Is this method iterative? There is some weakness in the explanation here. \n\nI have a hard time thinking of examples of the catalog problem. How common is it to need to order clusters? I did not follow the references in the first paragraph, which are cited as exemplars of application areas. Is it common to have supervision for the problems in these applications. This is a weakness in the presentation and extends into the demonstration data sets. A 2-dimensional mixture of Gaussians is a toy demonstration. The description of the procedurally generated catalog is vague and difficult to appreciate. What is the ground truth ordering? Is it the order with which each cluster is generated? Similarly, there appears to be no explicit statement of what constitutes a cluster or under what principle the clusters are ordered for the PROCAT experiment. I found it difficult to appreciate the goal of the ordering on PROCAT. ",

            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "I considered the proposed catalog problem since I did not know any method simultaneously obtains the clusters and rank the clusters without additional supervision. However, I doubt whether a solution to such a problem is useful in the real world because there usually exists more than one meaningful order among the groups. Without additional supervised information, the order obtained is likely to be arbitrary. For example, for the synthetic data as described in Figure 3, I am not sure why distance from the origin is a good criterion for ordering. Ordering based on either the horizontal or vertical axes also look meaningful. For the real-world dataset, as shown in Figure 5, it looks like the authors assume that the price of the items is chosen as the ground-truth quantity for the order (The authors might want to clarify what is the ground-truth ordering for this dataset ). However, it is also meaningful to items based on their weights, sizes, popularity, and expected revenues. Since more than one meaningful orders exist, I do not see how the proposed method can identify one that is useful in solving a real-world problem.\n\nThe clarity about the methods and the experiments might need to improve further. More details related to intra-set attention and multi-head self-attention block, as described in Equations (1) and (2), might need to be provided in the main text or supplementary. I do not understand Equation (3). A normal distribution is parameterized by the mean and variance. What does it mean when three quantities are provided? More detail about how Set Interdependence Transformer (SIT) is implemented should be provided. I do not understand the overall objective function of the proposed NOC method. Is the objective minimizing the reconstruction loss? The definitions for V-measure and Kendall's tau need to be provided. I would like to see the V-measure that quantifies the clustering quality when no ordering assumption is imposed. How is the ground-truth order obtained for the PROCAT dataset?\n",

In brief:\n\n1. The paper deals with a relatively \"niche\" topic, yet there is no proper problem statement section describing precisely the inputs, outputs, metrics and losses that characterise \"The Catalog Problem\".\n2. The paper heavily relies on prior work, but Section 3 only describes the key components at a high-level and with insufficient detail to clearly delineate this paper's contributions.\n\nTo this end, I strongly encourage the authors to rewrite the paper with a focus on clarity and accounting for the fact that, arguably, the paper deals with a problem that may not be familiar to many readers. In particular:\n\n+ The \"Catalog Problem\" should be mathematically defined without ambiguity. \n+ All model components should be detailed in the main manuscript in an entirely self-contained manner. It should be possible for readers not familiar with prior work to understand the proposed approach end-to-end.\n+ The authors should make clear exactly which model components are novel contributions and which originate from prior work.\n\n### Lack of motivation\n\nArguably, the paper's main contribution is to adapt prior work to a novel task, which the authors denote \"The Catalog Problem\". However, the manuscript does little to convince the reader that this is a relevant problem.\n\nTo this end, I suggest the authors to:\n+ Better motivate the need to not only cluster inputs, but also sort elements within each cluster.\n+ Provide convince examples that this is a problem where supervised datasets can be easily collected.\n+ Include more real-world examples and applications as part of the experiments.",

In spite of this, I do not believe the manuscript to be sufficiently convincing with respect to the relevance and importance of this problem.\n\nFinally, and perhaps less importantly, the manuscript's methodological contributions also appears to be limited, consisting of a novel application of existing components (c.f. Attentive Clustering Processes, Set Interdependence Transformers,  Enhanced Pointer Networks). However, this would be in my opinion only a minor problem if the authors provided sufficiently compelling evidence that this novel application is truly relevant for the field.",
