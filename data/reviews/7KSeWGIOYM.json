            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper presents a new method for trajectory forecasting. The proposed method consists of two ideas. (1) It introduces a new constraint such that (1a) predicted trajectories from consecutive inputs should not be different (temporal consistency) and (1b) the predicted trajectories should also be consistent regarding spatial transformations due to flipping and random noise (spatial consistency). (2) It further introduces a teacher-target constraint by enforcing multiple predictions from different training procedures to be consistent. Experimental results on the Argoverse dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "## Strong points\n- Overall, the paper is well written and easy to follow.\n- The motivation to introduce the proposed spatiotemporal constraints is valid, and the specific approach to realize that key idea seems straightforward and technically sound. As far as I have checked, introducing such spatiotemporal constraints for trajectory forecasting seems new.\n- The proposed method outperforms many recent methods on the Argoverse leaderboard. The ablation study further shows that each of the technical components in the proposed method contributes to the final forecasting performance.\n\n## Weak points\n- The paper could have become stronger if the method is evaluated on various datasets other than Argoverse, which involve not only vehicles but also pedestrians, together with more detailed analysis and discussions on how s time shift s should be determined. I think so because the appropriate setting of s can depend on video framerates and the frequency of sudden changes in motion. As s becomes larger or for a lower framerate videos, the temporal constraint could enforce inappropriate matching and may result in performance degradation as implied in Table 6. On the other hand, when s is too small or video framerates are too high, the temporal constraint will do little. It also remains unclear how well the proposed method works when trajectories involve many sudden changes of motion speeds and directions, like those of pedestrians. Currently we can learn from the paper only that s=1 worked the best for Argoverse, which is not very much informative considering the potential applications of the proposed method to other datasets.\n- The limitation and failure cases of the proposed method are not discussed, which I believe are crucial to judge the significance of the method. If the proposed method is applicable just for smooth vehicle trajectories recorded at a framerate within a certain narrow range, the proposed work could have a limited applicability and significance. If not, I think that this paper presents a nice contribution with a simple idea that works effectively for various situations. \n\n## Additional feedback\n- I would expect qualitative results to visualize not only the proposed method but also other baselines.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- **Clarity**: Overall the paper is written clearly, though the significance of contributions is not currently very much clear.\n- **Quality**: The quality is ok but not enough to me, due to some limited experimental evaluation.\n- **Novelty**: As far as I have checked, the proposed spatiotemporal constraint for trajectory forecasting seems to be a novel idea.\n- **Reproducibility**: Most implementation details are presented in the paper, although there is no guarantee that the presented results can be reproduced perfectly due to the absence of code submissions and random seed settings.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Currently I'm very neutral about this paper. It proposes a simple learning strategy involving several ideas, which performs really nice on the Argoverse leaderboard. However, it is not clear how applicable the proposed method is to a wide variety of situations, such as lower/higher framerate videos, or videos with other moving agents such as pedestrians. Limitations and failure cases are not discussed in detail, leaving it difficult to judge the significance of the proposed approach with the current manuscript.\n\n---\nPost-discussion comment: As my initial concerns above were resolved by the active discussion and paper revision with the authors, I would like to upgrade my score.

There are three different components proposed in the paper, namely, temporal consistency,\u00a0which aims to enforce the prediction model to output consistent results given two overlapping observations. Spatial consistency aims to enforce the refinement module to generate the same results given perturbation on the input. The teacher-target constraints allow us to distill a model from multiple teacher models with different initializations and the same architecture.\u00a0\n\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "\nStrength:\n\n1. The proposed method would only increase the training cost by a reasonable amount of training resources and does not make deployment more computationally expensive.\n\n2. The authors do a great job of demonstrating the framework's efficacy through an extensive comparison with the current state of the art.\n\n3. The framework is tested with existing approaches, making the result even more convincing.\u00a0\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n1. I am not sure whether it is a good idea to put different modules under the same umbrella, namely, self-consistency since the connection between components presented in the paper is loose. Each of them seems ad-hoc, thus, providing limited insights into the overall framework.\n\n2. The paper emphasizes too much on the result comparison, yet, misses important analysis. While there is a \u2018standard\u2019 component analysis tailored to understand \u2018how much' each component contributes to the final improvement, not much analysis is given to \u2018how\u2019 each component helps. For example, in section 3.2, the paper states \u2018Compared with data augmentation, it is the explicit regularization\u201d. It is easy for the reader to identify the difference here, but much harder for the reader to understand which one would be better and why it is better. I think the experiment part suffers from the issue most. The experiment results do not reveal much information about the design choice of the framework.\u00a0\n\n",

What is the criterion when choosing\u00a0spatial permutation function Z?\u00a0\u00a0It seems such a perturbation of the input shall not lead to a significant input change.\n2. How does spatial consistency distinguish itself from data augmentation?\n3. Why do we need a dedicated refinement module for spatial consistency?\u00a0\n4. Any evidence to show that the learned prediction would lead to more stable behaviors when coupled with down streams tasks like planning?\n5. Would the time consistency impose significantly more computation costs during training? To calculate time consistency, it seems the same trajectory would be trained multiple times.\n6. How should the teacher model be trained to ensure enough diversity?\n\nMinor points:\n1. By reading the introduction, it is not entirely clear to me what consistency refers to. It can be more explicit if a concrete example is included to illustrate the concept.\u00a0\n2. It is difficult for me to understand what is the notion of spatial consistency, in particular, what is the interpretation of consistency here.\n3.

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper introduces several consistency losses that help improve the performance of behavior prediction models. \n* The main innovation is the temporal consistency constraint, which enforces that predictions from adjacent time steps are similar. This is simple, but effective and -- to the best of my knowledge -- novel. \n* The spatial constraint is in effect a data augmentation technique -- enforcing robustness to small Gaussian noise to the input trajectories. I am not aware of this being commonly used, however, this is fairly straightforward, and the effect is pretty minor, compared to the temporal consistency constraint. As related work, ChauffeurNet (Bansal et al, 2019) also apply spatial perturbations, when they train a somewhat different type of model. \n* A model distillation technique is applied as an additional loss in the model, to improve the results. Model distillation for behavior prediction models is not novel per se. I am aware of at least one instance that is not cited:  \"Narrowing the Coordinate-frame Gap in Behavior Prediction Models: Distillation for Efficient and Accurate Scene-centric Motion Forecasting\" by DiJia Su and Bertrand Douillard and Rami Al-Rfou and Cheolho Park and Benjamin Sapp, ICRA 2022. \n\nThe losses above are applying to a TPCN architecture, augmented with a three-stage predictor head (goals -> trajectories -> trajectory refinement). The above is a fairly straightforward combination of existing architecture (TPCN) and model head ideas. ",

I assume these 10 models were used, along with K-means to provide 6 targets to train a student model? On the Argo and Waymo leaderboards, most results were obtained using an ensemble of models already. Did you use a single model for the leaderboards? More details here would be helpful. \n\nEq3 as written is not particularly clear. At this point, Z operation is not well defined -- what is Z^-1 for random noise?

My final rating depends on clarifying details around model ensembles: whether leaderboard submissions were one model, or many. If there were many models, how were those obtained -- were they all trained using the same teacher ensemble? More details and experimental results there would help. Also, doing ablation of the main idea -- temporal and spatial consistency loss -- on the Waymo Open Dataset, which has less input noise, would help as well. \n\n",
