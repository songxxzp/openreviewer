The authors provide a theoretical analysis for the convergence rate of the conditional distributions of the event data and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on common survival datasets.",

(2020) which needs to be cited. Those authors also report better results on METABRIC than Soden or NFM here. \n- The results in Table 1 have strongly overlapping confidence sets, casting doubts on the performance difference. Those might as well be explained by seed choice or hyperparameter tuning. Any claims on \"superior predictive performance\" should therefore be adjusted.

There are some odd phrases, see below. \n- The method is novel, however, not surprising as it seems mostly an extension of well-known classical survival techniques to the deep-learning setting and therefore relatively straightforward. The theoretical results seem non-trivial and strengthen the quality of the paper considerably. \n\n\nMinor:\n\n- Definition in equation (3) is the wrong way round, should be =: otherwise nonsensical. \n\n> Regression analysis of time-to-event data (Kalbfleisch & Prentice, 2002) has been the most important modeling tool for clinical studies \n\n\"most important\" is probably an exaggeration. \n\n> The key feature that differentiates time-to-event data from other types of data is that they are incompletely observed, [...]\n\nI would say \"often\" or \"usually\", but not necessarily.

The authors use a numerical integration to compute the integral in likelihood. What's the speed of this method compared to other approaches? Will it be very slow?\n3.
