            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors test the hypothesis of if memory-free navigation-based agents build maps of their environment. They use blind agents trained to perform PointNav, which are effectively operating in grid-world environments. They show very convincing and creative experiments controlling for the memory length of the agent, predicting occupancy maps, and probing the agent.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n- The paper is very well written and structured. It was a pleasure to read. I also appreciate the time that went into the figures and outline.\n- The experiments were well thought out and convincing. Both the probing experiments and occupancy map prediction experiments were very interesting and are convincing of the phenomenon of blind agents encoding maps.\n- It is surprising and impressive that blind agents are able to achieve 95% success rate on PointNav.\n- The question posed in this work is intellectually interesting and creative.\n- The experiments controlling for memory length are also great.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- **W1.** This paper presents a neat and interesting observation, and a set of experiments to test their hypothesis. However, the implications of this work don't seem very widespread or practically useful for future work. Suppose the hypothesis that model-free agents build maps without explicitly being trained to build them is true. Who cares? Will this change how you train embodied agents in the future?\n- **W2.** It's disappointing that the experiments with vision-based agents didn't work out. The hypothesis makes sense, but effectively, the experiments in this paper are on grid-world environments. It would have been nice to show the hypothesis holds with vision-based agents or in more complex tasks like rearrangement.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "The results seem like they should be fairly easy to reproduce, generally using existing datasets and packages that have been tested many times before. I appreciate the commitment to releasing the code.\n\nAs mentioned above, the work is very easy to follow along and understand and the hypothesis that this paper attempted to solve was very creative, novel, and enjoyable. There isn't a ton of work focused on similar emergent behaviors of embodied agents.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "I found the paper very enjoyable and really interesting to read. The work isn't going to be very practically useful and won't change much from a practitioner's perspective, but tests a creative hypothesis of if maps emerge from blind navigation-based agents, which appears to be true. Overall, I found the experiments were very well thought out and convincing, and think the paper is a clear accept.",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies the implicit emergence of mapping in simple recurrent blind agents. Removing the visual modality allows authors to reduce the possible strategies to reach the specified goal and to thus isolate the construction of an internal map. As mentioned in the paper, no technical novelty is proposed, but a study about an important and interesting question, i.e. whether simple recurrent agents can learn to implicitly map scenes, is studied. \n\nThe work presents many surprising findings, such as the strong performance of blind agents, the emergence of neurons specialised in collision detection, the impressive long horizon memory developed these agents, the quality of spatial maps decoded from the agents\u2019 hidden state, and finally the capacity to forget information that is not useful for the task at hand. Authors also show that if initialising the hidden state of an agent with the one from another agent that has finished an episode, the new episode navigates more efficiently between the starting and end points, in both directions.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths:\n1. Understanding the internal representation of scenes from neural agents is an important direction, both to make them more interpretable and to study the strategies that can be purely learnt from data.\n2. The context of the work is well defined, and the experiments are detailed and thorough.\n3. This paper presents many surprising findings (stated in paper summary) that are important for the Embodied AI community. \n\nWeaknesses:\n1. I am not convinced with the point made by authors in Section 5 about the ability to properly decode the occupancy maps even in unseen locations. This might suggest the decoding model rather learns some patterns about the average structure of occupancy maps. Results on this decoding task are still interesting, but maybe less strong. It would be interesting to quantify how biased towards some redundant structure in maps the decoding model is.\n2. It would be interesting to consider a comparison with a baseline that shares the same architecture as the blind agent, but composed of an additional explicit map with differentiable write and read operations. This could allow to compare the content of the maps with the ones decoded from the recurrent agent\u2019s hidden state, as well as task performance.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "Claims are clearly stated in the paper and well supported empirically. Experiments are detailed, allowing reproducibility. Previous work has already considered the emergence of mechanisms close to place cells in recurrent agents (Banino et al., Vector-based navigation using grid-like representations in artificial agents), but this work can still be considered as original from the direction of studying blind agents and the diverse experimental studies.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "Such empirical study is of high importance for the community. This paper provides many interesting and well supported insights. Allowing to better understand the underlying reasoning of simple recurrent agents can help develop better navigating agents in the future. I thus tend to recommend acceptance, but am still looking for answers from the authors to my remarks",

The paper is a thoroughly interesting investigation and includes experiments to understand (1) how well blind memory-full agents can navigate despite their significant limitations, (2) how memory can be transplanted to imbue another agent with the ability to navigate more effectively (using that experience), and (3) to decode the agents' memories into occupancy grids as a means of scrutinizing their implicit maps of their surroundings.\n",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The paper is incredibly well written and detailed and the experiments are thought provoking. The paper explores an interesting topic that should be interested to anyone---including both AI/ML scientists and also perhaps cognitive scientists---working in the space of navigation. Each experiment effectively answers its respective \"question\" and is accompanied with convincing visuals. While the paper does not introduce new \"techniques\" for navigation or training navigation agents, this should not be seen as a limitation of the work and the investigation and the analyses are valuable on their own. I have only a few comments and questions.\n\nI have some potential concerns about the results from Sec. 3 (Memory is used over long horizons). The agent is trained in such a way that the LSTM is expecting to receive all the previous observations from the start. As such, are the experiments providing out-of-distribution signals to the agent? Can the authors comment on the possibility of poor performance being a result of this shift in the nature of the data. Similarly, if the agent were retrained with a time-limited memory horizon (e.g., 100 or 500 steps), would we expect an increase in performance; new experiments are likely not necessary, though clarification on this point will be helpful.\n\nRelatedly, it would be helpful to have a separate curve (perhaps on the same plot) showing the success rate versus memory length in Fig. 2, as I believe this to be a key detail for understanding the performance with limited memory.\n\nSmaller questions and comments\n- The line in Sec. 2 \"but also that collisions-vs-not are linearly separable in this space\": I do not believe that this claim logically follows from the previous clause. It may be true, but seems disconnected.\n- The authors may also want to reference \"Learning Deployable Navigation Policies at Kilometer Scale from a Single Traversal\" by Bruce, et al 2018. The appendix of this paper tries to extract localization information from an agent's latent state, and may also be good to mention in the related work [I also believe another early paper in the VisDoom environment used a similar approach, but I am unable to find it.]\n- Introduction: I understand why it is included in the introduction but that \"memory\" is essential for strong performance is a fairly obvious conclusion even if the results in the respective section are more detailed. Consider rephrasing this question and answer to reflect the nuance of the effect under scrutiny.",

            "summary_of_the_review": "Overall, this is an excellent paper. I have only limited changes and suggestions for improvement. The investigation is detailed and thought provoking. The authors should strive to answer my question about the impact of memory on the agent's performance.\n",

This paper investigates a question \u201cis mapping an emergent phenomenon?\u201d In this work, the authors make their AI agent \u201cblind\u201d, which means that only egomotion sensor is present, making the agent having minimal perceptual system.

The strong performance by blind agents are explained by the role of memory, and the memory encodes the implicit maps about the environment. \n- In the section 2, the authors explain how the blind agents are becoming effective navigators (e.g. emergence of wall-following behavior and collision-detection neurons).
