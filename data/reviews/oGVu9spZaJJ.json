It provides an exact characterization of the complexity of each problem instance ${\\cal C}(f)$, which is related to the amount of information to distinguish instance $f$ from other instances with different optimal decisions. The paper designs a three step algorithm based on uniform sampling (to construct MLE of f), identification (to boost confidence in the estimate of f) and exploitation (to maximize reward), whose lengths are carefully adjusted, and proves an asymptotic regret of ${\\cal C}(f) \\log n$ recovering well-known instance-dependent regret bounds for bandits and improving upon instance-dependent regret bounds for reinforcement learning.

Based on what I have read, I would highly recommend this paper and give it a score of 8.\n\nIn this part, I will list some questions about some details in this paper.\n1. In the definition of $\\mathcal{C}(f,n)$, the authors mention the last constraint (4) makes sure $w_{\\pi}<\\infty$ even if the decision has no regret. Could the authors be more specific in explaining how $w_{\\pi}=\\infty$ if we remove constraint (4)?\n2. I'm a little confused with the instance complexity $\\mathcal{C}(f)$ and some other instance complexity in [1,2]. Could the authors give some comparisons in rebuttal?\n3. I understand this work provides a tight instance-optimal regret in the asymptotic regime. However, I'm more curious about how the technique used in this paper could inspire other future works. \n4. About the assumption that the optimal policy is unique. I'm thinking about a simple multi-arm bandit problem, where $\\mu_1=\\mu_2>\\mu_i$ for $i=3,...,n$. If the optimal policy is not unique, will the instance-optimality still hold? Or how will it fail?\n\nDue to my limited time, I will consider adding more questions in the rebuttal phase.\n\n[1]Koulik Khamaru, Eric Xia, Martin J Wainwright, and Michael I Jordan.

The paper also discusses the required covering arguments to extend the result to infinite hpyothesis classes\n\nOn the other hand, the algorithmic approach is the same as in Lattimore et al (2017). The algorithm is neither practical from a sample complexity perspective (exponential lower order terms, horizon dependent, not worst-case optimal); nor computationally feasible unless both the hypothesis space and decision set is small.
