It has high sample efficiency. It can also be learned from scratch using a few data (5-10 demonstrations). The EBM used MCMC-sample-based MLE to train.\n\nThey experiment EDF on 6-DoF robotic manipulation tasks (pick-and-place cups and etc.).

            "strength_and_weaknesses": "This paper proposes a data-efficient model that could learn end-to-end for robotic manipulation from visual demonstrations. Compared with previous SE(3) - equivariant models, the proposed method could learn from only a few demonstrations without pre-training. The authors have proposed an interesting solution to solve the sample efficiency problem, yet there are still concerns about the experiment part to demonstrate the proposed method. Please refer to the below comments for my questions about this paper.\n\nMethod:\n1. According to the paper, the major contribution is that the authors propose an EBM to model the descriptor field. However, the related content only takes a small part, and most materials in section 2 are about the description of SE(3)-equivalent. The author should emphasize more on the proposed contribution, while the less relevant concept and formulas could be left in citations.\n\n2. For the proposed EDF, there are related works about MCMC sampling [1][2] and relevant learning methods for point clouds, such as [3]. It is essential to introduce and compare these related works since the EDF is the major contribution in this paper.\n\nExcept for the proposed method, I also have some concerns about the experiments.\n\n1. The author has only shown the experiment in the task of mug hanging. However, as the author has mentioned about Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF), there are additional manipulation targets used in the simulated environment, i.e., bowl and bottle. Why not the author conduct these experiments to show the generalization of the proposed method?\n\n2. Although the author has claimed that the model could learn without prior segmentation from the background, the experiment is conducted in a very simple environment. This raises concerns if the EDFs (or IDFs) could perform as expected when the environment becomes complicated, such as introducing random distracting objects.\n\n3. Although the author has mentioned that NDF requires pre-training, it is self-supersized in an auto-encoding way that requires no expert labels. Therefore it is of great interest to see the comparison between NDF and the proposed method since both models could learn from a few demonstrations. This should be listed in the experiment section.\n\n4. In the first paragraph in section 6, the author should mention the computation architecture when mentioning the processing time. Additionally, since the author has claimed the learning efficiency of NDF, it is worthwhile to compare the time efficiency in the experiments.\n\n\nWriting:\n1. In the experiment section, the author mix uses different tenses in the experiment settings and descriptions (also found in other sections). \n2. In the last paragraph of section 3, Transporter networks ->  Transporter Networks\n3. Background related to EBM is missing in section 2.\n\n[1] Zhu, Song Chun, and David Mumford. \"Grade: Gibbs reaction and diffusion equations.\" Sixth International Conference on Computer Vision (IEEE Cat.

The major concern from me about the effectiveness of the proposed method is the experiment section, where the author mainly conducts the experiment in a simulation environment and merely in the pick&place task of a mug. Since the author has claimed no pre-segmented points cloud info is required in the proposed method, the author needs to show the generalization on different manipulation objects. Furthermore, in the compared methods, i.e., Transporter Networks (TN) or Neural Descriptor Fields (NDF), the authors conduct the experiments in multiple situations to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed methods, such as 10 different manipulation tasks in TN and real-world experiment in NDF. Please refer to the previous comments for my concerns.\n\n---Post Rebuttal----\n\nFirst, I'd like to move my rating from 3->5 due to the significant revision of the paper and the updated experiments. However, as I am not an expert in the field of robotics, I still have concerns about the experiment part. Although the author has updated the experiments with more objects, I am not sure about the meaning of the comparison result.

Specifically, it focuses on the same robotic manipulation task as previous work, Neural Descriptor Field. The authors derive an energy function based on the representation of the Lie group, which can be used to characterize the distance/discrepancy between SE(3) pose in the demonstration and the current state. By approximating the gradient of the function with sampling, the SE(3)-equivariance demonstration following problems are formulated as an energy minimization problem. Experiments on the object placement task show that the proposed method outperforms the modified-Transporter Network and Invariant Descriptor Fields method. \n",

It is an important technique for many 3D vision and robotics applications. Although the TransporterNetwork shows that such kind of network design is helpful for manipulation tasks, it still relies on the translational invariance of CNN but does not explore this problem in a more general SE(3) space and does not deal with the hard rotation part. The authors leverage the representation theory of third-order Lie groups to define the bi-equivariant energy using the probability distribution on SE(3). The formulated equivariant descriptor field can then be used in a key-query system, as previous NDF. I feel that the energy-based model in 4.2 makes much sense. But the implementation choice of using Dirac delta functions to shape the query density makes this design not so useful in many applications where continuous parameterization is more preferred.\n\nOne weakness of this paper is the gradient of EBM, which requires a special sampling strategy described in Section 5. It seems that this design makes the overall complexity of the method very high in applications and leads to a very long inference time. As the author discussed in the final section, this method cannot solve problems at the trajectory level. ",
