            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors present DISSECT, a method for estimating cell fraction and gene expression from bulk RNA sequencing data. The primary innovation in DISSECT is the introduction of a regularization term during training that encourages similar expression profiles between simulated bulk data (drawn from scRNA-seq data) and real bulk RNA-seq data. A multilayer perceptron is used to estimate cell-type proportions and an autoencoder is used to estimate cell-type specific gene expression profiles. The authors evaluate their method on several real bulk RNA-seq datasets of PBMCs.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "I believe the authors are pursuing a good research direction within the field of RNA-seq deconvolution, with the incorporation of a consistency loss into training, and this problem is important for biological studies, but this field has been studied extensively and to make a contribution to it, a more thorough investigation is needed. \n\nStrengths:\n- The problem of RNA-seq deconvolution is of great importance for many biological studies.\n- Adding a consistency loss is a good insight for addressing the issue of differing characteristics between scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq.\n- The authors are aware of other primary competing methods in the field of cell-type deconvolution.\n- The authors have clearly laid out the logic of their reasoning about the consistency loss and the math details are explained clearly and are easy to follow.\n- Overall, the paper is well-written.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- As mentioned, there has been extensive work toward solving the problem of deconvolution. The authors have only applied their method to datasets of PMBCs, and if I understand their training procedure correctly for cell-type estimation, only used the PBMC8k dataset as the single-cell reference (or did they use all 4 from Table 1?). Even so, these datasets are from one individual each (per the description in Table 1), thus the datasets are limited in their ability to capture possible person-to-person or technical variation. Thus, it could be that their advantage comes largely from this limitation. In comparison, MuSiC compared to several different tissue types and used scRNA-seq data of 10-20 individuals. To make a compelling case, the authors need to apply to more tissue types and use a more diverse set of reference single-cell datasets. (The authors include results for some other types of data in the Appendix, but need to provide quantitative comparisons and an explanation of the results.)\n- In particular, the authors should consider doing an evaluation that exactly compares to some of those reported in MuSiC or (Avila Cobos et al., 2020); this would give greater confidence that their evaluation matches what is reported in those works.\n- Furthermore, as was shown in the benchmarking study of (Avila Cobos et al., 2020), the normalization procedure can have dramatic effects on the results of deconvolution. The authors comment in the Appendix C.3 that their procedure is standard for Scaden, but given the potential dramatic impact, more reasoning should be provided for the other methods as well, especially in light of the analysis of (Avila Cobos et al., 2020).\n- The incorporation of the consistency regularization, while sensible and a good consideration, is not in itself a significant algorithmic advance, at least for the scope of ICLR.\n- There are other methods that are not referenced: Bisque (Jew et al., Nature Communications 2020) and DWLS (Tsoucas et al., Nature Communications 2019). The authors are correct that MuSiC and Cibersort are the main established methods, but still some reference should be made to these methods to distinguish theirs and a comparison against them would strengthen their work.",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "- As mentioned above, there is some ambiguity about how the cell-type estimation was performed. It is stated that the PBMC8k dataset was used as the single-cell reference dataset for deconvolving the bulk RNA-seq data in Table 1. This produced the results in Table 4. Were the other scRNA-seq datasets not used then for DISSECT or any other method to produce Table 4? Was this then the only dataset used for the MuSiC? Again, if so, this would be a disadvantage for MuSiC, since it is designed for multi-sample data.\n- The incorporation of the consistency regularization, while sensible and a good consideration, is not in itself a significant algorithmic advance. A more extensive evaluation would help overcome this weakness.\n- I do commend the authors on the clarity of their work and believe it has potential if further developed.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "The current state of the evaluation and its limitations, as mentioned above, are the primary weaknesses of the work in its current state.

DISSECT leveraged both the training data with ground-truth proportions and simulated data based on scRNA-seq reference. It can be seen as an augmentation strategy which mixes the training data with synthetic data or a regularization framework that solves the domain shift problem between the training domain and reference (scRNA-seq) domain. Authors completed extensive evaluations over a large collection of datasets and compared DISSECT with other competitive methods. Authors highlighted the superior performance of DISSECT and provided a possible extension on applying DISSECT on the spatial transcriptomic data which was a new application scenario.\u0000",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "The manuscript was well written and included major players in the field of celltype deconvolution to compare in the computational experiments. The shared code repository was helpful to better understand the algorithm. There are some experiment details that need to be clarified as follows.\n\nMajor Concerns\n\n1.\t(section 4.3.2) The experiments estimating celltype-specific gene expression was only conducted on the simulated bulk RNA-seq data. This is insufficient to evaluate how DISSECT behaves in practice. One possible source of verification data can be imaging-based spatial transcriptomics data [1], as authors have tried applying DISSECT on the spatial transcriptomic data.\n\n2.\t(section 3) Authors constructed the Linear MLPs removing the consistency loss which may be not a fair comparison. I am wondering how Linear MLPs would behave if the consistency loss was incorporated.\n\n3.\t(section 2.2.1) The first training phase was purely based on the simulated examples. I am curious to see what the performance of DISSECT is right after this simulation-based training phase. This can be seen as an ablation test to check how mixing the training data with training data helps improve the deconvolution performance.\n\n4.\tI didn\u2019t find descriptions on how the training/validation/test sets were split for each dataset. Could you elaborate on this?\n\nMinor Concerns\n\n1.\tScaden [2] included both SDY67 (called PBMC1) and Monaco (named PBMC2) for comparison in their manuscript. Their reported correlations were different compared to those reported in Table 3. I am wondering what could possibly lead to this difference.\n\n\n[1] Cable, Dylan M., et al. \"Cell type-specific inference of differential expression in spatial transcriptomics.\" Nature methods 19.9 (2022): 1076-1087.\n\n[2] Menden, Kevin, et al. \"Deep learning\u2013based cell composition analysis from tissue expression profiles.\" Science advances 6.30 (2020): eaba2619.\n",

Does not $S$ represent the expression profiles across cell types? \n\n- Section 2.1.2, Eq. 4 should be written as $x_i s_i$, not $s_i x_i$.\n\n- Is the number of cell types given to the model apriori? How does the deconvolution performance change in the absence of having the true number of cell types in the bulk RNA-seq data?\n\n- In Figure 1.a, I think the first \u201c+\u201d operation should be \u201c=\u201d.\n\n- Why do you use a variational approach to learn signature matrix? Why not just an MLP, similar to $X$ matrix estimation? Is there any plan to use the latent factors? \n\n- How many genes are profiled in datasets in Tables 1 & 2? Are you using the same subset of genes in Eq. 3?\n\n- I think reporting MSE (which is reported in the supplement) is more informative rather than reporting correlation between estimated variables and true ones.
