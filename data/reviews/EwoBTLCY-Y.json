            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors proposed to estimate optimal transport maps that are parameterized as neural networks.\nThe proposed method is established based on reformulating the Kantorovich dual problem as maxmin problem which optimizes for a stochastic transport map and a potential jointly. Then, the authors also introduce a cost metric that encourages the transport map to preserve the class information, when mapping two datasets with conditional labels. \nThe authors evaluated their proposed method on a few datasets, including toy synthetic data and real-world image datasets. The proposed method is shown to be effective. ",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "Pro:\n-This manuscript is pretty well-written and easy to follow. \n-The proposed method is well motivated as the authors comprehensively introduced different OT problem settings step by step.\n-The experimental results are well-organized. The authors provided both qualitative and quantitative results to evaluate their proposed method.\n\nCons and questions:\n-There might be some concerns regarding the novelty. The proposed objective, as well as algorithm 1 are similar to that in one of the cited works [Korotin 2022c]. Although in this paper, the authors computed a class-guided cost.\n-In equation (11) and Proposition 1. It seems that the stochastic map is asked to map one mixture towards another. However, how to define the correspondence of classes between different domains? What will happen if the number of classes is different between two datasets? This may break down to the optimal transport between two mixture distributions. \n",
            "clarity,_quality,_novelty_and_reproducibility": "This paper overall clearly demonstrated an approach to estimate optimal transport with neural networks. I would expect the authors to further elaborate on the contribution and distinguish this work from previous ones since the weak-Cost formulation and algorithm 1 are very similar to [Korotion 2022c]. The clarity is mostly good. \n",

            "summary_of_the_paper": "The authors first take a generalization to the strong and weak optimal transport problems by replacing the objective function from an expected cost wrt the transport plan to a general lower-semicontinuous functional. This formulation coincides with the regularized optimal transport, however, it is easier to adjust under different domains as one can directly design the functional rather than the additive regularizer.  It is shown that this problem admits a strong dual which is a max-min optimization problem, resembling the Kantorovich dual. The authors then show how to retrieve the optimal transportation plan from this dual, which coincides with the saddle points. By exploiting this result, they derive an NN-based solution algorithm, and afterward, they show how one can benefit from such a framework in a case where the underlying domain is concerned with having a \"cost\" representation that is beyond distances. They illustrate the performance of these methods over various numerical experiment settings.",
            "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength:** Firstly, I would like to thank the author for such a clear motivation, literature review, theoretical analysis, numerical experiments, implementation, and discussions. I am **not** an expert in OT, but I used it in my research a couple of times, and as far as I am concerned the paper looks like a great fit for the community.\n\n**Weaknesses:** \n*I list some minor weaknesses. I am going to stay active during the discussion period in case the authors update the document or have questions about my review.*\n\n***Minor Weaknesses/Questions***\n- Section 1 starts very 'quick'. What is \"unpaired restoration and style translation\", for example?\n- Section 2: In the beginning we have $\\mathcal{X} = \\mathcal{Y}$. Is this a typo?\n- For Wasserstein-1 and Wasserstein-2 terminologies in Section 2, the given citations are specifically recent NN-based papers. However, the terminology definition comes from much earlier if I am not wrong.\n- \"General OT\" (5) requires citations. It may look like this is a new definition.\n- Section 3.1: \"which alternative to (6)\" -> typo\n- Theorem 1: \"minimax\" -> maximin ? (The rest says maximin)\n- Question: Is (11) used in any other paper before? If not, Proposition 1 can be a theorem.\n- Section 6: \"as well as the trained networks\" -> \"along with\" is maybe better?\n- Section 3.3 looks shorter than it has to be, in my view. There is a huge relevant literature in Stochastic Programming, but here it is a little hard to relate. The proposed unbiased estimator comes without discussion. \n\n**UPDATE**\nAfter reading (Korotin et al., 2022c) I am less enthusiastic about this work. I like the paper, but in the presence of the other one, I think the setting taken here can be derived relatively easily. I would like to update my score to \"5\" instead of \"8\". ",

However, to give a high-level answer:\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is written very clearly. It is easy to follow. The theoretical contributions are clearly stated and the limitations are honestly discussed.\n\n**Quality:** The paper has high quality. The experiments, visualizations, and results are thorough. The proofs look correct to me.\n\n**Novelty:** The paper has novelty, and can guide the community toward a very modern adaptation of OT thanks to Section 4.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides all the source codes, and the main algorithm is very clear. I cannot foresee any issues with reproducibility. The limitations are also discussed.",
