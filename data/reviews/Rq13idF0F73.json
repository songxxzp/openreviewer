The authors propose a fragment-by-fragment sequential approach, which is summarized in the following steps:\n\n- substructure (or motif) vocabulary creation \n- context encoding (the context is initially just the binding site, then it's binding site + existing molecule)\n- focal motif selection (i.e. selecting the initial motif / the motif used to expand the existing molecule)\n- next motif prediction (i.e. selecting the motif to attach from the vocabulary\n- motif attachment and orientation\n- substructure refinement\n\nIn the experiments, the authors show that the model generates molecules with high binding affinity, sometimes even better than the reference, while also possessing high drug-likeness.

However, there are sections where I couldn't properly understand what has been done from the text alone. As for the writing style, some symbols are undefined, some occasional typos, and improper use of citations, but nothing of real concern. See below for details.\n\n**Quality**\n\nOverall, the work is medium-to-high quality. The modeling is fairly complicated, but I'd expect that since we are dealing with a very difficult task. The evaluation in particular is done with proper care (i.e. comparing to the baselines trained with the same data splits, which is not to be taken for granted in this field) and the results are convincing.\n\n**Novelty**\n\nThe work reuses known concepts and modeling tools and puts them together in an innovative manner (at least, to my knowledge).\n\n**Reproducibility**\n\nThe work is **not** reproducible. The code is not provided and the authors state that it will be released upon acceptance.",
            "summary_of_the_review": "In general, I find this paper a solid contribution, probably worthy of ICLR. The most disappointing part is that I cannot look at the code, which to me makes it irreproducible. \n\nBesides this, I have several questions I'd like the authors to answer, and some comments/suggestions/corrections.\nPlease acknowledge that I am not an expert in structure-based drug design (though I know the general problem and main approaches).\n\nIn no particular order:\n- What is the vocabulary size? Do 2D-isomorphic motifs with different geometry get encoded as two different \"words\" in the vocabulary?\n- You say that after pruning chemically invalid molecules and _merging isomorphic graphs_ you reduce the set of candidates attachments. How do you handle merging isomorphic graphs, considering that it can be computationally expensive in certain cases?\n- What are the valid, novel, and unique fractions of the molecules generated for the test set?\n- Can you show examples where the model fails to generate molecules that bind to a given target (as in Fig. 3)?\n- Why did you use QVina to evaluate the Vina scores, instead of more recent alternatives (GNina)? \n- You state that all the generated molecules were further refined with universal force fields before being fed to Vina. Did the molecules generated with the baselines get the same treatment?\n- Why did you use GIN as a scoring function for candidate attachments?\n- At times, the notation is confusing. For example, in Eq. 4), the $\\mathrm{MLP}$ function has two arguments, while in Eq. 9 it has three. I thought that would mean concatenation, but then when in the equation where you define the distance matrix (which by the way is not numbered) the $\\mathrm{MLP}^d$ uses $concat$ to describe a concatenated input. Please correct or explain.\n- you say that $\\boldsymbol{e}_{\\mathrm{RBF}}$ can be either a Gaussian function or a spherical Bessel function. Which is the actual used in this work?\n- you should use \\citep instead of \\cite for the citations.\n- there is a missing closing parenthesis in Eq. 10\n\nFinally, I think there are two citations that should be considered in Section 2 when you talk about motif-based generation.\n- Podda et al.

A motif vocabulary is constructed by extracting common molecular fragments (i.e., motif) in the dataset. At each generation step, a 3D graph neural network is first employed to encode the intermediate context information. Then, the model selects the focal motif, predicts the next motif type, and attaches the new motif. The bond lengths/angles can be quickly and accurately determined by cheminformatics tools. Finally, the molecular geometry is further adjusted according to the predicted rotation angle and the structure refinement. In their conducted experiments, results shows that their method is able to generate diverse drug-like molecules with good binding affinity to target proteins, is faster than most of the baseline methods at sampling new molecules and outperforms baselines by a large margin on generating valid molecules with realistic substructures.

It is possible that FLAG model just fits the structural distribution of the whole ligand library rather than the distribution conditioned on the specific target. \n2.\tThe authors do not illustrate key differences between this FLAG model and other fragment-based methods, such as \u201cFragment-Based Ligand Generation Guided By Geometric Deep Learning On Protein-Ligand Structure\u201d and \u201cScalable Fragment-Based 3D Molecular Design with Reinforcement Learning\u201d. Besides, the authors say, \u201cHowever, in these works, starting fragments are required and the motif vocabulary needs to be constructed by experts, limiting their practical applications.\u201d However, introducing experts\u2019 knowledge to generate drug-like molecules in order to avoid uncommon or toxic fragments is quite reasonable in drug design. This statement is invalidated.\n3.\tAs for the motif extraction step, there are some doubts when it comes to find all the rotatable bonds. Rotatable bonds are usually just single bonds in organic chemistry.
