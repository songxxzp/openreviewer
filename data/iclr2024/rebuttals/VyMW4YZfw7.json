Based on this posit, the authors propose a simplified one-layer GNN with a kernel. First, the adjacency matrix is applied with a low-rank singular value decomposition. Then, singular values are filtered by a kernel function. Finally, the kernel matrix is multiplied with a learnable parameter vector. By choosing different kernel function, the proposed GNN achieves great performance in semi-surpervised graph classification."

                    "value": "### Major:\n1. In sec. 1, the authors mention \"we simultaneously simplify and generalize previous spectral approaches to SSNC while maintaining or exceeding previous performance benchmarks.\" This seems the technique examed by this work. However, the details of simpliciation techniques and the pipeline are lacking, as the first paragraphs in sec. 3 are enough and systematic.\n2. Applying nonlinearity to the spectrum is not a new thing. Then, the difference or the particular interest of eveluations leveraging such technique seems unclear in this work.\n3. Despite of the paragraph under Eq.(2), the procedures and complexity of how the $K$ and $K\\alpha$ are computed are still unclear. Should we compute a kernel matrix $K$ first and compute its eigenvectors $\\alpha$? If so, it would take some computation especially in an iterative update scheme.\n4. In the paragraph **spectral truncation factor**, do we need to compute the SVD of $A$? What if the graph is really big?\n5. How is the hyperparamter of the SBF kernel tuned?\n6. In sec. 2, the authors mentioned \"consider a one layer linear GNN\", so is it consistent to the experiment in Sec. 3? If so, how about the multiple-layer case evaluations? As mentioned in bulltet 1, the reviewer would expect a clearer and more symtematic view on how the GNN is built and how the experiments are proceeded under which setups.\n7. The evaluated graphs are not large enough. The reviewer would wonder how the authors think or what the evaluation results would be for large-scale graphs. Does the low-rank simplification property still hold competence with complicated methods?\n \n\n### Minor:\n1. Please unify the notations of vectors, matrices, etc.\n2. For directed networs, the number of evaluated datasets is a bit too less.\n3. The results in Fig. 3 seem a common sense, as the less being truncated the more information being reserved. For different datasets, the reasonable percents of truncation vary a lot, which is reasonable for the tasks, but what would be the particular interest revealed in fig. 3 for this work? It seems unclear. By changing the kernels, the reviewer would expect different results (despite similar trend for some datasets).\n4. What would be the difference with the kernel spectral method, or is the kernel spectral method also applicable? In kernel specral method, the data matrix, e.g., the adjacency matrix $A$ is applied with weighted KPCA problem and conducts a (generalized) eigenvalue problem on the kernel matrix [1], or the adjacency matrix $A$ is applied with the asymmetrick kernel SVD techniques for performing the singular value decomposition.\n5. Either in sec.3 or somewhere, the reviewer would suggest to have an overall sketch on the roles and main purposes for each set of experiments in sec.3-5, which shall improve readability and present the readers from checking paragraphs and sections back and forth.\n6. For most of the cases evaluated, the performance gaps are still substantial.\n7. Can the efficiency be compared?\n\n\n[1] Alzate C., Suykens J. A.

The authors suggest using conventional techniques from nonparametric estimation in the spectral domain to improve GNN performance. *This original approach challenges the prevailing notion that complex GNN architectures are necessary for high performance.*\n\nQuality: The paper provides a thorough ablative study on the hyperparameters associated with GNN spectral filtering techniques. It investigates the impact of different propagation structures, spectral truncation factors, and kernel choices. The *experimental results demonstrate that the proposed simpler GNN models perform on par with or better than current state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for SSNC*. The study reflects a high quality of research methodology and experimental rigor.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-written and effectively presents its arguments, findings, and methodologies. The document snippets provide concise summaries that cover various aspects of the paper, such as the experiments conducted, evaluation conventions, and evaluation results. The organization of the document snippets allows for a clear understanding of the different sections and their content.\n\nSignificance: The paper\u2019s significance lies in its ability to simplify modeling considerations for GNNs while achieving state-of-the-art or near-state-of-the-art results. By highlighting the importance of spectral reshaping and modeling techniques, the paper suggests that GNN architectures can be streamlined without sacrificing performance. This has implications for the development of more interpretable GNN models and heuristics for SSNC problems. Additionally, the paper addresses recent shifts in evaluation conventions and provides insights into improving performance on SSNC benchmarks."

Did you conduct any sensitivity analysis on these choices?\n\n- Have you considered comparing your proposed approach with existing GNN architectures on a broader set of benchmark datasets to ensure the generality of your claims? The paper lacks an extensive experimental investigation on multiple benchmarks and algorithms with several ablation studies regarding the claim of the paper? Or rather a theoretical study of the phenomenon observed.\n\n- Could you elaborate on the limitations and assumptions of your method? Are there scenarios where your approach may not be as effective, and if so, what are they?\n\n- There are multiple typos in the paper. Could you please proofread?"
