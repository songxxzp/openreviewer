                    "value": "This paper proposes an optimization for efficient Winograd structure pruning to achieve higher parallelism and workload balance while maintaining good accuracy. It consists of two major optimizations: efficiently utilizing the computing units on GPUs by simultaneously pruning grouped weights and maintaining an equal pruning ratio between WC matrices to ensure that each GPU computing unit completes the same number of workloads. Compared to filter pruning and the vanilla Winograd algorithm, it achieves better accuracy or lower latency."

The pruning technique and proposed workload balancing optimization are incremental contributions. Recently, there have been numerous works on pruning that achieve impressive compression ratios [1], but it remains unclear how much benefit they surpass unstructured pruning (with a higher pruning rate). The third contribution is also straight-forward.\n\n[1] AutoCompress: An Automatic DNN Structured Pruning Framework for Ultra-High Compression Rates"

It would be extremely helpful if the authors could justify their contributions from these aspects:\n\n1. About its novelty: structured (and semi-structured) model pruning is a research hotspot with extensive research efforts and results. It would be helpful to further justify the difference (and novelty) of performing structured pruning on Winograd Conv from other operators.\n\n2. Fig. 7 shows that ABWSP cannot achieve the same accuracy as WWP with an identical pruning ratio. In other words, it sacrifices accuracy for latency performance gains. This is very similar to the accuracy and latency tradeoff on other operators. There exist many optimization techniques on GPUs for irregular/sparse tensor computations. It is somewhat unclear if the WWP implementation is fully optimized, particularly without the necessary implementation details in the current version of the paper. It would be extremely helpful to offer more details about its implementation, such as data storage format, any applied optimizations, etc.\n\n3. It would be helpful to provide a speedup ablation study on an individual Conv layer with varied configurations for performance understanding.\n\nMinor:\nPlease consider revising these minor issues:\n- Some important abbreviations (e.g., WSP, BWSP, FP) are used without explanations when they are introduced.\n- Font sizes in some important figures are too small (e.g., Fig. 7) to read."

From this argument, we can see FP outperforms WWP with hardware-efficient sparsity and no index computation. So why do we not use FP directly rather than proposing ABWSP to apply a hardware-efficient sparsity scheme in WC to reduce the overhead of index computation?\n3. Evaluation is not sufficient. Most of the evaluation focuses on the ResNet and VGG architectures. It will be better if more model architectures are evaluated, like EfficientNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet.\n4. Baselines are restricted. Only WWP and FP are considered as baselines, missing a lot of SOTA pruning works [1-9]. Also, the related WWP methods discussed in Section 3 should also be compared in the Evaluation.\n5.
