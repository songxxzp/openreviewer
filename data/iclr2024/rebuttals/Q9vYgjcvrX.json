                    "value": "This paper proposes *Sass*, a framework for instruction data generation using open-source models. The paper starts by exploring two main semi-supervised generation settings: generating responses for existing instructions (self-training) and generating instructions for responses (instruction generation). The authors found that the instruction-generation strategy is better. Based on this observation, this paper further proposes an instruction-filtering strategy and extract-then-generate strategy to ensure the alignment and diversity of instructions. With the constructed instruction-tuning data, experiments are conducted on LongForm and Alpaca Eval, both indicating better performance."

There are many existing works focusing on either generating instructions given responses or generating responses given instructions, as introduced in the related work section. However, the authors did not discuss the relatedness or differences compared with previous works, which makes it even harder to understand the contribution of this work. Also, this paper forgets an important baseline [1].\n- Although I like the preliminary study, the analysis in Section 3 is not sound and detailed enough. For example, why use more Dolly data leads to worse performance? Why Lima + Dolly together is even worse? How do you arrive at the conclusion that \"this phenomenon further confirms our hypotheses that it is easier to generate appropriate instructions for the given response.\"?\n- The experiments and evaluations are not so convincing. The proposed method *Sass* is just evaluated on two automatic evaluation benchmarks. It is necessary to have human evaluation and examine the quality of the generated instructions of multiple dimensions. Also, the performance is not that significant compared with previous baselines.\n-  The experiment details for results in Section 5 are missing. \n\n[1] Li, Xian, et al. \"Self-alignment with instruction backtranslation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.06259 (2023)."

It emphasizes the necessity of high-quality instruction data, which is challenging to obtain due to the high costs of human annotation. The paper explores utilizing open-source models to autonomously generate instruction data, as opposed to leveraging powerful closed-source models. It introduces semi-supervised instruction data generation strategies to enhance the performance of open-source models. The authors propose two techniques, namely instruction filtering and an extract-then-generate strategy, to augment the diversity and alignment of generated instructions. Through experiments on the LongForm benchmark and GPT-4 evaluation, the strategies demonstrate effectiveness. Interestingly, even weaker models self-generating data exhibit performance comparable to distillation from stronger models, showcasing potential for progress in generating quality instruction data without relying on closed-source models."

I suggest the authors run experiments on 13B and 33B models as well. Moreover, the authors should also try LLaMA-2-7B as their base model to fine-tune.\n\n3.

This alternative could obviate the need for extensive training of open models to perform tasks involving instruction generation or output generation. There's a need for comprehensive exploration of other potential methods for generating instruction-tuning data based on open models.\n\n**Novelty limitations**: It leaves me an impression that the paper are actually doing fundamentally very similar works such as instruction -> output (Instruction GPT-4) and output -> instruction (Dynosaur and Instruction Induction (Honovich et al., 2022)). But the models are simply changed from GPT-series models to open-source LLMs. It might be better to see if it is possible to invent a brand new paradigm for generating the instruction-tuning data instead of mainly adopting the previous formulations."

How do the generations from the model compare to GPT-4 like models? How do they differ? Are there types of tasks that the quality of the generations is better? \n\n**Discrepancies in the numbers reported from baseline papers.**\nThe average METEOR score reported by Koksal et. al. [a], the main baseline in the paper, is 24.8 (see Table 2 in [a]). But, in Table 1, this work reports 20.27 which is significantly lower than the baseline. Since the proposed work reports a METEOR score of 22.51, I\u2019d be curious to know the reason for the discrepancy. \n\n**Missing key implementation details.**\nSome of the details regarding the baselines are missing. LIMA [b] does not release their dataset to the public instead they mention the sources of the dataset. It would be great if the authors could provide more details regarding the approximations they made when creating the LIMA training dataset. Furthermore, [b] also trains their model with a different learning rate and uses linear decay. It isn\u2019t clear from the paper if the work has changed any of these hyperparameters. \n\n**Paper organization and writing is not clear.**\n- The preliminary study could be moved after the method section because several details from the method section are required to understand the preliminary study. Furthermore, Figure 1 could be improved by monotonically increasing the amount of augmented data. At the moment, the x-axis reads as follows Dolly 1000 -> Dolly 5000 -> Dolly 14K -> LIMA 1000 -> Dolly 14K + LIMA 1000). Finally, it is unclear why the work omits results on self-training with Dolly 1000 and Dolly 5000.\n\n- The paper introduces the term \u201corigin document\u201d when analyzing the extracted fragments without sufficient content/background. It would be helpful for the readers to standardize the terms throughout the paper. \n\n**Related work.**\nI\u2019d like to point out a few related and concurrent works that have not been included in the related work section:\n- Self-Alignment with Instruction Backtranslation. ArXiV 23.\n- Learning Instructions with Unlabeled Data for Zero-Shot Cross-Task Generalization. EMNLP 22. \n\n**Nit:**\n\nPage 2, paragraph 1: tight alignment -> alignment (because I\u2019m not sure what tight alignment means as opposed to loose alignment)\n\nDYNASAUR missing from Table 1. \n\n**References**\n\n[a] LongForm: Optimizing Instruction Tuning for Long Text Generation with Corpus Extraction.
