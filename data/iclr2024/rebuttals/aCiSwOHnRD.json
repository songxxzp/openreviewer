The authors propose to fine-tune the backbone network with two task heads, one of which uses dropout to mask random features. The produced logits from this head are then used as a supervision signal for the other head, called \"self-distill\". Experimental results show that this method can improve the final performance on various fine-tuning methods."

However, it is hard for me to understand why the introduced sparse-feature-based regularization helps. How does the sparsity of features affect generalization? It seems that the paper should discuss this more rigorously.\n- The paper studies the situation where limited downstream data are provided, and the training set only contains 200 samples. What would happen if the training set is increased? Is there any further explanation?"

                        "value": "We really appreciate your comments and reviewing. We supply some experiments for this response.\n\n**Q1. How do you choose hyperparameters?**\n\n**A1.** We have $\\lambda$ (the weight of $L_3$), $t$ (the distillation temperature coefficient) and $s$ (the sparsity of the binary mask). We choose the optimal hyperparameters by a grid search. The detailed configuration of each experiment is shown in our appendix. \n\n**Q2. The evaluation dataset is limited.**\n\n**A2.** We conduct experiments on more datasets with ResNet-18:\n\n|           | Caltech101 | CIFAR100 | FLowers | Oxford | SVHN  | DTD   |\n|-----------|------------|----------|---------|--------|-------|-------|\n| w/o SEFAR | 57.85      | 15.06    | 41.54   | 39.30  | 73.90 | 26.29 |\n| w/ SEFAR  | 59.09      | 16.57    | 42.82   | 41.47  | 76.62 | 29.15 |\n\nIn this table, SEFAR shows its consistent positive gain for the full fine-tuning method.\n\n**Q3. What if sparsity is set to 0 (figure 3a)**\n\n**A3.** When the sparsity is set to 0, on the EuroSAT dataset, the results with different distillation temperature coefficients are:\n\n| Method                  | Accuracy |\n|-------------------------|----------|\n| w/o SEFAR               | 83.55    |\n| w/ SEFAR, s=0, t = 1    | 83.52    |\n| w/ SEFAR, s=0, t = 2    | 84.61    |\n| w/ SEFAR, s=0, t = 5    | 84.46    |\n| w/ SEFAR, s=0, t = 10   | 84.07    |\n| w/ SEFAR, s=0.3, t = 10 | 86.05    |\n\nResults with s=0 are not as good as the result with s=0.3, which illustrates that the sparsity is important.\n\n**Q4. How does the sparsity of features affect generalization?**\n\n**A4.** Figure 3 (a) provides an initial insight into the impact of sparsity on linear probing. In our experiments, we conducted a grid search across values {0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9} to identify the optimal sparsity value. In the future, we may explore the detailed mechanism.\n\n**Q5. What would happen if the training set is increased?**\n\n**A5.** We conduct experiments with various training dataset sizes and the results are:\n|           | 20 images | 200 images | 500 images | 2000 images |\n|-----------|:---------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|\n| w/o SEFAR |   43.65   |    83.55   |    89.65   |    95.06    |\n|  w/ SEFAR |   48.03   |    86.05   |    90.87   |    95.26    |\n\nThe gain in performance with SEFAR becomes more pronounced as the number of training set images decreases. Additionally, as the number of training images increases, the additional generalization can be derived from the incremental data. Therefore, SEFAR is particularly suitable for use when fine-tuning with a limited number of images."

So the contribution is limited.**\n\n**A1.** Our main contribution is we discover that the sparse feature can be a good teacher in the self-distillation process. We theoretically and experimentally prove why it can work well.\n \n\n**Q2. The theoretical analysis (one-class case) with MSE loss is oversimplified.**\n\n**A2.** We think that one-class case + MSE Loss analysis is a common way, as shown in [1]. We also empirically confirmed that the results of MSE loss are consistent with the cross-entropy case in practice, which can be observed in Table 4 of our submitted script.\n\n**Q3. t is very strange that the t-SNE of each class in Fig.2c forms as disk. How to understand that ``randomly dropping some dimensions to generate sparse features may result in enhanced discriminative capabilities''? It seems interesting.** \n\n**A3.** We also consider this to be a fascinating phenomenon: when randomly masking certain features, the performance of feature clustering improves. In the future, we plan to conduct more experiments and theoretical exploration to understand the underlying reasons.\n\n**Q4. The organization of experiment section.**\n\n**A4.** We think it is a good suggestion and we may reorganize the paper by add a new section for theoretical analysis.\n\n**Q5.

Itself doesn\u2019t have any novelty. \nThe main difference here in my opinion is that the authors used a mask on the inputs of the additional head: I personally do not know papers with similar methods. However it is very unclear how the mask is generated (the maskgen algorithm mentioned): from the limited information that I can find in the paper, it seems that the mask is randomly generated, not learned or anything. In this sense, basically this method does a random dropout on a certain layer (i.e. the input of the additional head). It is not surprising that it can bring a regularization effect. The originality of this method seems weak to me. \nHowever, sometimes simple combination of existing methods may have a surprising effect, if the empirical study strongly supports it. Unfortunately as mentioned below in quality section, I don\u2019t think the empirical study is convincing enough. \n\nQuality\n\n- 4.2 ablation study: what about the impact of mask in additional head? I.e. If we have L1,L2,L3 and no mask (i.e. all feature used; or sparsity=0), what is the result? what about we have self-distillation and just apply dropout (on some layers or just all task heads)? Would we observe similar improvement as the proposed method?\n\nClarity\n\n- The maskgen algorithm is not properly described. Is it just randomly generates a mask with a given sparsity? How many sparsity parameters you tuned for the experiments given? (You mentioned that the sparsity has minimal impact on W2 in table 3. This is not what I would like to ask). My question is for major comparison table 1, for each row w/ SEFAR, how many sparsity parameters you have tuned? And what is their impact on the classification results (of W1)? An example is your figure 3(a). \n\nSignificance\n\nThe author claims that this paper targets to help finetuning problem with limited data. However I do not see any explanation or empirical study to support this.\n\n-\tDoes SEFAR helps less with finetuning problem with more data? Is there any reason theatrically? Or empirical evidence? \n\n-\tWhat is considered limited data? Why there is no related work or empirical study comparing with methods that also specifically address limited data finetuning methods?\n\nIt also claims that this method \u201csignificantly enhance the performance of any fine-tuning method\u201d. However, I see that the authors choose to compare with only several finetuning methods that are not claimed to be state-of-the-art (linear probing, L2-SP (Xuhong et al., 2018), DELTA (Li et al., 2019), and surgical fine-tuning (Lee et al., 2022)). To support such claim that the authors made, experiments with more recent SOTA methods, and on the datasets that those papers used are necessary.\n\n\n------------------\nafter seeing author's response:\nThank you authors for clarifying and adding additional ablation study that I asked. It does help improve the confidence level of the effectiveness of the proposed method on the given datasets. However my major concern on the significance section was not fully addressed. I still think the claims made (e.g. any finetuning method, limited data) are not supported. I keep my original score."

For the maskgen algorithm and the way to generating the sparse mask.**\n\n**A1.** In this paper, we clarify that the sparse mask is randomly generated, without any learning process. Specifically, we generate an all-one matrix with the same shape of the feature. Then we randomly select a ratio of elements and set them 0. The ratio is the sparsity mentioned as $\\lambda$.\n\n**Q2. If we have $L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$ and no mask (i.e. all feature used; or sparsity=0), what is the result.**\n\n**A2.** Here are the results on EuroSAT dataset:\n\n| Method                           | Accuracy |\n|----------------------------------|----------|\n| w/o SEFAR                        | 83.55    |\n| w/ SEFAR (sparsity s= 0, t=1)    | 83.52    |\n| w/ SEFAR (sparsity s= 0, t=2)    | 84.81    |\n| w/ SEFAR (sparsity s= 0, t=5)    | 84.56    |\n| w/ SEFAR (sparsity s= 0, t=10)   | 84.27    |\n| w/ SEFAR (sparsity s= 0.3, t=10) | 86.05    |\n\nWe also explore if L2 itself can work well on EuroSAT, the results are:\n\n| Backbone                     | Loss function        | Accuracy |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|----------|\n|                              | L1 only              | 83.55    |\n| ResNet-18                    | L2 only (DropOut)    | 85.10    |\n|                              | L1+L2+L3 (Our SEFAR) | 86.05    |\n|                              | L1 only              | 52.18    |\n| ViT-small (Full fine-tuning) | L2 only (DropOut)    | 53.87    |\n|                              | L1+L2+L3 (Our SEFAR) | 55.59    |\n\nAccording to this table, we can observe that although SEFAR seems to be a combination of DropOut and self-distillation in its implementation, the gains in terms of results are even greater, especially on ViT-small.\n\n**Q3.

More evaluation on language models and other larger CNN models**\n\n**A1.** Due to constraints in time and computational resources, we conducted experiments using VGG11, VGG11 (with BN), MobileNet v2, LoRA+ViT-B, and LoRA+ViT-L on the EuroSAT dataset. The results are as follows: \n\n\n| Backbone        | Method     | Accuracy |\n|-----------------|------------|----------|\n|                 | w/o SEFAR  | 72.86    |\n| VGG11           | w/ SEFAR   | 77.11    |\n|                 | $\\Delta$   | +4.25    |\n|                 | w/o SEFAR  | 84.03    |\n| VGG11 (with BN) | w/ SEFAR   | 85.58    |\n|                 | $ \\Delta$  | +1.55    |\n|                 | w/o SEFAR  | 86.19    |\n| MobileNet v2    | w/ SEFAR   | 87.74    |\n|                 | $ \\Delta$  | +1.55    |\n|                 | w/o SEFAR  | 88.54    |\n| LoRA+ViT-B      | w/ SEFAR   | 91.37    |\n|                 | $ \\Delta$  | +2.83    |\n|                 | w/o SEFAR  | 89.96    |\n| VGG11           | w/ SEFAR   | 92.76    |\n|                 | $ \\Delta $ | +2.80    |\n\nIt is obvious that SEFAR can work across different network families and scales.\n\n**Q2. Whether different masks can lead to different performance and how to choose a good mask. Can we optimize the masks during finetuning.**\n\n**A2.**  In our approach, we introduce a randomly generated binary mask, where the sparsity (i.e., the proportion of zeros) is the only variable that needs to be controlled. During the training process, the mask is randomly generated and does not need to be optimized.\n\n**Q3. T-SNE results show marginal improvement.**\n\n**A3.** In the T-SNE results, our primary focus is to highlight the differences in clustering outcomes between the original features and sparse features. Specifically, in scenarios with a limited number of training samples, sparse features exhibit superior clustering performance. Therefore, utilizing the classification results generated by sparse features as the teacher in self-distillation proves to be more advantageous."
