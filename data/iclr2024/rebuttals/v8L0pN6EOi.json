However, there are many other tasks such as essay writing and story generation where it can be hard to provide such feedback. Therefore, it is unclear if the method is generalizable.\n3.

We appreciate your points, especially that process-level reward for language models should be explored more fully across a variety of domains, but disagree on your overall assessment of our contribution.\n\nYou are correct that dense rewards are well studied in RL. However, the majority of LLM RL literature is still focused on sparse rewards. That our methods strongly improve on current baselines shows that reward shaping in this domain is understudied. We think it is important for performance and alignment of LLMs to investigate intermediate rewards further (hence our contribution of a large open-source dataset of dense human feedback).\n\nWe agree with your second point that these methods should be explored on more general distributions. However, the purpose of this paper is to present a clear, compelling argument that researchers should explore process-level feedback further. For this, it is better to start with domains that are easier to evaluate.\n\n\nTo the question: We explicitly argue in section 2.6 that our process-level labels are equivalent in cost to outcome-level labels (so under the same budget the step-level rewards are better), and figure 4 shows about how big a set of outcome-level labels would be needed to recover the performance of our process-level model."

                        "value": "We appreciate the feedback. We address your concerns below.\n\n1. We agree there is much more work to be done exploring process supervision in other domains, but we felt the math domain provided a clear and compelling testbed for our core insights. It is important for scientific arguments to be clear and compelling so that we can incrementally build strong foundations for future knowledge.\n\n2. The primary purpose of this work is to study how to train reliable reward models, which is an important problem in its own right. While we agree that there are interesting connections to RLHF that are worth investigating further, we leave that to future work.\n\n\nWe agree (and argue exactly in section 7.1) that a large enough outcome supervision dataset should recover the performance of our process reward model. I am not certain this is a weakness. We believe this is actually the core contribution of the paper: It is expensive to do RLHF because human feedback is expensive, so we show you can do RLHF more cheaply by collecting more dense labels from humans."

The authors conduct a detailed comparison of these two types of supervision for training reward models, using a more capable base model and significantly more human feedback.\n\nThe main contributions of the paper are\n  * demonstrating that process supervision can train more reliable reward models than outcome supervision, with their model solving 78.2% of problems from a representative subset of the MATH test set\n  * showing that active learning can lead to a 2.6\u00d7 improvement in the data efficiency of process supervision\n  * releasing their full process supervision dataset, PRM800K, to promote related research."

The authors did not have sufficient details for both models and data.  In the paper, the authors stated, \"The small-scale base models are similar in design to GPT-4, but they were pretrained with roughly 200 times less compute.\" However, the paper neither reveals the size of the small-scale base models nor the large-scale base models.  It is unclear whether the data gets the PRM to work or the scale of the model that gets it to work. I understand that work done at industry has its confidentiality rules to follow, but the authors can maybe conduct experiments on open models on their pretraining and fine-tuning datasets? Due to the reproducibility issue, I think this work would be a better fit for a blog post than a main conference paper.\n2. It is unclear whether PRM would work for other types of reasoning problems."

We think this review accurately identifies the contributions and limitations of our work.\n\nWe should absolutely continue exploring the generalization of our methods into other domains, but believe it is reasonable to begin with math. We hope our generalization results in Table 1 (into chemistry and physics in particular) give some initial evidence that this method generalizes.\n\nWe also appreciate the concerns around reproducibility. While we believe our small-scale results should be wholly reproducible on open-source models, it would have been more responsible of us to test that directly. The large-scale results are likely not replicable on any currently-available open-source models. This is an unfortunate limitation of the current state of the technology and a valid criticism. We still believe it\u2019s important that we report results at the frontiers of scale. We think this is a valid contribution to the literature, since our results suggest that process supervision enables more cost-efficient reward model training at all model sizes."
