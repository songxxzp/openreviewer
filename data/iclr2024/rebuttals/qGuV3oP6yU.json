As for the ProLLaMA, there is a mixture of OccuQuest and Tulu datasets in training phrase.\n2. There might be hallucinations in generated dataset which is not considered in this paper.\n3. The paper needs further analysis on whether there is mutual influence between occupations when the number of occupational categories increases significantly (over 1000 categories mentioned in the article) and after the samples are balanced.\n4. Mixing OccuQuest with other datasets may improve the model's performance on MMLU, GSM8K, HumanEval, etc. Further experiments are needed to analyze the correlation between them. It's also necessary to check whether there is a possibility of evaluation data leakage when collecting data through ChatGPT."

They also show that combining their training data with existing training data e.g., Tulu can lead to strong task performance. \n\nOverall, I don't think this paper provides sufficient novelties--generating instruction-output training data has been actively studied and synthetically creating occupation-guided prompt queries only does not provide enough technical contributions to ICLR--and discrepancies between original motivations (to train an LM to generate helpful responses to professional queries from practitioners in specific fields) and proposed method / final evaluation protocols.

                    "value": "### Soundness of prposed method and evaluations to enhance LM abilities in expert domains\n\nThe core motivation of this work is to enhance LMs' abilities of generating more helpful responses to professional domain queries. \n>  However, existing instruction-tuning datasets suffer from occupational bias: the majority of data relates to only a few occupations, which hampers the instruction-tuned LLMs to generate helpful responses to professional queries from practitioners in specific fields. To mitigate this issue and promote occupation-inclusive LLMs, we create an instruction-tuning dataset named OccuQuest\n\nI don't think the proposed method properly address this issue (unless careful human evaluation indicates that generated data is indeed high-quality) and the evaluation protocols are appropriate to assess the quality of model generations in those areas. \n\n**Proposed method** \nI don't agree that this approach, generating more training data from ChatGPT, can result in high-quality data to train reliable LMs in professional domains. Growing number of papers show that ChatGPT or GPT 0002/003 frequently hallucinate or fabricated responses to such professional queries or long-tail areas. Generating training data from ChatGPT for those professional queries can easily result in many factually incorrect responses, and smaller LMs trained on this distilled data can follow this trend. If the main focus of this work is to improve LM generation quality in such domains, I think the essential step is to conduct thorough expert analysis on generated queries, and check whether the queries are high-quality. \n\n**Evaluation protocols**\nThe main evaluations are soley based on GPT-4 or human preference-based evaluations on the OccuQuest test sets created by the same protocol as the training dataset, or Quora queries. It is not surprsing that the model trained on OccuQuest train sets can obtain stronger performance on the in-domain test set, and I don't think getting higher win-rate on those datasets indicate whether the model indeeds performs better. \n\nMoreover, the overall preference-based method may not be suitable for such usecases as (1) overall preference-based evaluations are often heavily influenced by superficial factors, and (2) human evaluators (or GPT-4) may not be fully reliable to assess the quality of generations in professional / expert domains. \n\n(1) Recent work including the Tulu paper shows that GPT-4-based evaluations are often biased toward the longer response, and may not reflect the true quality of generation. To assess the quality of responses, especially in professional domains as authors claimed in the paper, more careful and fine-grained evaluations should be done. \n\n(2) The human evaluations are also conducted by three annotators on 100 queries. Are the three annotators familiar with all of the domains of 26 occupations? If the annotators are not fully familiar with all target areas, the preference evaluation may not be reliable. \nFor instance, a recent ExpertQA paper (Malaviya et al., 2023) conducted fine-grained human evaluations from multiple aspects (e.g., evidence, responses, attribution, reliability of evidence) by hiring experts. [Xu et al. (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18201) also show that to evaluate the quality of long-form QA, human annotators need to have expertise in the area. \n\n**LImited technical ontributions or novelties** \n\nThis work shows interesting empirical findings and exploration, but I don't think formulating occupation-centric queries and generating more instruction-output data from a strong LM are sufficient contributions for ICLR."

Probably trying different configurations to avoid such overlap in Figure may help. Also Figure 6 occupation names are cut off and for some bars, I am not sure which occupation corresponds to the substring."
