We provide some examples of unsubstantiated claims:\n\n(Section 2.2) \u201cThis indirectly suggests that the model training is equivalent to training an encoder. However, we have not provided an explanation for these phenomenon. On one hand, we do not have the time to provide a comprehensive mathematical proof,\u201d\n(Section 2.4) \u201cIn the model initialization phase, all parameters are randomly initialized. At this point, regardless of the input received by the encoder, after undergoing multiple rounds of random parameter adjustment, they will almost all be mapped to similar representations.\u201d\n(Section 2.4) \u201cThe paper assumes default training using the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. If other optimization algorithms are used, there may be differences in the formulation processes, but it does not affect the conclusion.\u201d\n\n\nW2. The phenomena claimed to be elucidated in the paper are already well-known facts, rendering them trivial. We provide some examples:\n\n- The observation in Section 2.1, where distinct representations are formed based on classes, is a well-established fact.\n- The practice of employing the expectation of a representation as a decoder in Class Incremental Learning is a widely recognized approach. For more details, you can refer to the following paper. [Rebuffi, S. A., Kolesnikov, A., Sperl, G., & Lampert, C. H. (2017). icarl: Incremental classifier and representation learning. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 2001-2010)].\n\n\nW3. The explanation in the paper is difficult to comprehend.\n\n- The notations are confusing.\n- The provided explanations for the experimental results are insufficient.\n- Descriptions for the axes on the figures are absent."

We simply aim to convey that training is primarily to enable the encoder to acquire the ability to differentiate inputs.\n(2) This part does lack additional experiments, but it is indeed the case.\n(3) If other optimization algorithms are used here, it is true that it won't be as straightforward as in Section 2.4. However, the change will be more complex, but it still occurs along the memory trace. If forgetting occurs, similar representations will be generated, and if normal training takes place, dissimilar representations will be produced.\n\nResponse to Weak2: Thank you for your information.\n\nResponse to Weak3: Thank you for your feedback."

                    "value": "Overall, it seems that none of the results in the paper are particularly original, and it rather looks like that the authors are not aware of prior work in the field.\n\nThis is reflected by some mis-use of terminology (e.g., encoder/decoder) and by strong statements (e.g., \"One such problem that has remained inexplicable since the advent of neural networks is catastrophic forgetting\"; \"However, we do not fully understand how they accomplish this process, which is why they are often referred to as black boxes.\").\n\nLikewise, language is informal and imprecise (e.g., introduction, and then at many places in the text like \"To address this issue, we first introduce a definition here\"; \"Now, we have both good news and bad news. The good news is that we now have a clear understanding of how catastrophic forgetting occurs. The bad news is that it is intertwined with the concept of backpropagation\".\nThe way the article is written would be suitable for a blog post, but not for a formal scientific article.\n\nGeneral remarks:\n    - The split of any neural network in encoder/decoder parts seems mostly arbitrary and it does not add much to the paper.\n    - It seems that most of the results presented have been known in the field for a long time?\n\n    - Typos and general grammar issues, e.g., \"After pre-trained, we trained a new decoder using\", etc.\n    - Minor: fig. 4 use of accuracy may be a bit misleading, since only 10 samples are used (it is also not clear whether the full test set is used, or also only 10 compressed representations like for the training set). In this context, `accuracy' can only take 11 possible values."

                        "value": "Response to Weaks: \n\nThe term \"interleaved representations\" is inspired by Section 2.4. From the content of Section 2.4, we can understand that the numerical distribution of representations between different tasks will exhibit an interleaved pattern of highs and lows. The implementation details of the expectation of representation are mentioned in the final part of Section 2.1. \n\nPart of this is indeed missing in Section 2.2, as reflected in Figure 6. If we use the same dataset for testing in the experiments of Equation 3 as in the pre-training dataset, the accuracy curve will stay around 100%. This is why we claim that \"the parameters of the decoder converge to the expectation of the representation\"\n\nResponse to the question: Thank you for your feedback."

As the issue of catastrophic forgetting is well studied theoretically [1-8], even the issues of neural cross-talk across task is studied empirically [9-11]. Hence, I am not sure about the novelty of this work, as almost all concepts covered in this work have already been proven in prior works so what is the novelty?\n\nAdditionally, it looks like the current manuscript is borrowed from a thesis, as section 2.3 says, \u201cIn the previous chapter\u201d\u2014What is the chapter here?\n\nWhat are Conclusion One and Conclusion 2? Why are they not mentioned in the text? On page 3, the author talks about conclusion one? However it is not mentioned anywhere in the manuscript what the conclusion means.\n\nExperiment details are missing; nothing is mentioned to reproduce the results, no ablation study, and no discussion on hyper-parameter optimization.\n\nForgetting in these systems can also be understood by forgetting ratio, backward transfer, and forward transfer (for instance, look at gradient episodic memory paper).\n\nThe current draft is not ready to get published in conferences such as ICLR; it lacks structure, the related section is weak, the experimental section is weak.\n\nThere is a plethora of work that tries to explain the working of memory, representation and internal of NNs, I would advise looking into literature. \n\n\n1.\tDoan, T., Bennani, M.A., Mazoure, B., Rabusseau, G. and Alquier, P., 2021, March.

                        "value": "Response to Weak6: The dataset content is controlled by the parameter [task] here. For instance, [0] indicates only dataset 0, while [0,1,2] includes datasets 0, 1, and 2. Therefore, the use of SHUFFLE has no impact. When we specifically desire a certain dataset, it is controlled through [task].\n\nResponse to Question 1: We have provided an explanation of the relationship between representations, parameters, and catastrophic forgetting. Then we try to reproduce how catastrophic forgetting manifests in parameter changes during the training process. This is distinct from [1-11]. The contribution lies in a negative assessment, asserting that without altering the training method, it would be impossible to overcome  catastrophic forgetting at the cost of retraining, as referenced in Section 3, paragraph 3. Simultaneously, it suggests directions for improvement. To effectively overcome catastrophic forgetting at a reasonable cost, one must utilize the manifestation of historical memory trace in network parameters, aiming to achieve effects similar to those described in Section 2.4.\n\nResponse to Question 2: This is a writing issue and specifically refers to Sections 2.1 and 2.2.\n\nResponse to Question 3: This is a writing issue and actually refers to equation 2 and 3.\n\nResponse to Question 4: Regarding the experiments in Section 2.2, we have provided the source code. For Conclusion One, parameters can be freely adjusted, while for Conclusion Two, there is no training process involved as it is computed directly. As for the experiments in Section 3, we utilized a third-party visualization library, so the source code is not included. \n\nResponses to Questions 5-7: We aim to establish a simpler logical chain to illustrate how catastrophic forgetting specifically occurs in engineering."
