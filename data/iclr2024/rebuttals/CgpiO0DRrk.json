To tackle this issue, the authors proposed KDCdCEC, an adaptive knowledge-distillation based cross-domain collaborative edge caching framework to overcome the temporal drift and spatial drift in the caching data simultaneously. The authors fully analyzed and verified the data and experiments, but there is a high degree of redundancy in writing and poor sense of paragraph hierarchy."

In the formulation of the Problem, we consider that $C$ contents in the cache should be replaced each time, and in the most extreme case, $C$ new contents should be filled. Then, we carry out slot-wise transformation to decouple the stored content from the storage location, so that EBS with different capacities can be adapted. We acknowledge that relying only on the request number to extract features is a simplification, but the features extracted from the number of requests are straightforward and effective.\n\n#Response to weakness 2\n##The experiments on the traffic cost of different baselines can reflect the cost of data exchange, which can reflect their complexity to a certain extent (for example, although the Baseline only relying on content-level cooperation can achieve a relatively close cache hit rate to our proposed algorithm, However, it faces a traffic cost much higher than our algorithm), the hardware used for training and the training time have been supplementary explained in the architectures and training parameters in section 4.\n\n#Response to weakness 3\n##We added the further discussion section before conclusion (Section 6). \n\n#Response to weakness 4\n##We adopted your suggestion and the layout has been adjusted\n\n#Response to weakness 5\n##We adopted your suggestion and changed eq.(1) to a clearer form."

How the proposed model will change accordingly?\n  - For example, one big file needs to replace a few small files and thus the action will change (action will no longer be binary but rather will need to span a few entries in the action matrix and hence the action will be very hard (combinatorial problem) - which video files to evacuate in order to place the new big file)\n- Reward seems to be designed to only capture the local reward and no global term. How to ensure consensus in terms of convergence? No convergence analysis is provided.\n- Scalability and scaling the algorithm to cover the more general form of different file sizes and servers differences will make the state space and action space (NP Hard, comb. problem) very large and thus very complex to solve. \n- Each EBS serves a distinct region (no overlap, as per the paper) and optimizing each EBS individually should be sufficed in my opinion. How sharing among servers will help here?\n- How is the three defined temporal metrics related to video file arrival rate?. Why not adopting arrival rate instead since it is widely used and correlate/encapsulate at least two of these three metrics?"

Our focus is on how to enhance EBS collaboration on a strategy-level, so the size of the video is simplified, and our slot-wise design can be adjusted to almost all different EBS storage space.\n\n#Response to weakness 2\n##The number of requests in the past time windows is the core metric to evaluate popularity, as the input to the neural network. We follow the assumptions made in previous work and do not regard retrieval time (latency) and file size as the focus of this work.\n\n#Response to weakness 3\n##The goal of all EBS is to improve their own cache hit rate, and the global goal is also consistent with this. Because in our framework, there is no content-level cooperation between EBS, so each EBS does not need to consider what content is cached by other EBS, and only needs to search for caching strategies to refer from beneficial partners.\n\n#Response to weakness 4\n##This work makes a slot-wise design, and the method can be used for devices with different cache sizes. If the size of the video and the capacity of EBS are considered, an additional replacement algorithm needs to be designed for implementation, which is not the focus of this work\n\n#Response to weakness 5\n##Although the regions served by different EBS do not overlap, according to our data measurement results in Fig. 1(a), we find that the request volume of different regions is positively correlated with the cache hit rate when the same model is deployed. We believe that EBS with larger request volume has effective strategies to assist its cache replacement. Moreover, this strategy can assist the EBS devices with sparse requests to perform cache replacement better.\n\n#Response to weakness 6\n##The second metric is the average latency calculated with CHR, but it gives a more intuitive and significant representation of the latency experienced by the user. The communication overhead of the third metric is negatively correlated with CHR, and positively correlated with the number of information exchange between among EBSs and CDN when using different algorithms, which can comprehensively reflect the performance of the algorithm."

This paper conducted a measurement study and revealed that the primary factor influencing caching performance is the spatio-temporal diversities in request patterns. To tackle the issue of sparse requests in specific Edge Base Stations (EBSs), the paper proposes to use knowledge distillation to transfer knowledge from request-dense EBSs to request-sparse ones. To further account for the spatio-temporal drift in request distribution across EBSs, the paper designs an adaptive KD-based cross-domain collaborative edge caching framework, named KDCdCEC. The proposed framework consists of three major components: 1) a RL agent to make caching replacement decisions in each EBS; 2) a deep deterministic policy gradient-based algorithm to adaptively configure the reference weights for adaptive KD; 3) a content-aware request routing mechanism. Experiment results shows the effectiveness of KDCdCEC under a specific caching setting."

                    "value": "1. The problem statement or definition of collaborative edge caching in this paper lacks clarity and support.\n1) The paper assumes that the EBSs collaborate by sharing caching policies rather than cached content. This assumption gives rise to two problems. Firstly, considering that each EBS has limited cache storage, if they don't share cached content among themselves, every cache miss would necessitate content retrieval from remote CDN servers. Consequently, the potential benefits of collaborative edge caching are constrained since it doesn't significantly reduce backbone traffic. Secondly, the paper also highlights the spatial drift and diversity of request patterns in different EBS domains. This raises a question about the rationale behind advocating the sharing of caching policies among EBSs. For example, if one EBS serves requests with a LRU pattern, while another EBS caters to a LFU pattern, how would these two EBSs benefit from sharing caching policies when their request patterns differ?\n2) This paper studies a caching problem with a fixed number of video contents, which significantly deviates from real caching systems where the number of videos or objects varies over time. Furthermore, the paper assumes the CDN server have cached all the videos. However, considering the substantial number of videos (i.e., 2.887 million) mentioned in the evaluation section, this assumption might be overly stringent, as CDNs typically have relatively limited storage capacity.\n2. The presentation of the proposed framework in the paper lacks clarity, and certain claims about the techniques are not well substantiated.\n1) The paper claims that the RL agent is slot-wise and can adapt to EBSs with different storage sizes. However, it's noted that the action space of the RL agent is C \\times C, where C seems a fixed number across all EBSs throughout the paper (including the evaluation section). If C does indeed differ among EBSs, then during knowledge distillation, how do you handle the variable input state size, which is 2C \\times F?\n2) What is the content-aware request routing mechanism? I did not find any technique description about it.\n3) The paper uses the names and notations interchangeably, which leads to confusion regarding the number of neural networks within the proposed framework, their specific functions, and how they are trained, particularly in the case of the popularity network.\n4) What is the ration behind the design of the reward in Equation 1? As the reward is determined by consecutive cache misses to the same cache slot, if that cache slot stores a popular video, the delay of reward for the popular video is much longer than the delay of reward in the situation of storing an unpopular video at the slot. This further indicates that the training data (i..e, the transition tuple (s, a, \\tao, s\u2019)) can be potentially imbalanced. \n5) How does the reference weight agent adapt to dynamic partner lists? If two EBSs are no longer pattern, it seems the corresponding action network parameter in the reference weight agent should be zero. Then, how do you enforce this when training the reference weight agent?\n6) it is unclear how the proposed framework update reference partner list.\n7) The training location and process of the RL agents and neural networks are not detailed in the paper, and additional information is not provided. For example, what is the training convergence speed and time of the RL agents? What is the size of training data for different EBS domain. This is important as the edge server often has limited computation and storage resources. \n3. The paper's evaluation results are not sufficiently robust or convincing. What is the reason to choose a cache size of 32? The caching size should be related to the total active video content number. Besides, the proposed framework should be evaluated on various caching size setting.\n4.

As for the situation you mentioned that the request patterns of different regions are different, in the framework we designed, each EBS can adjust the appropriate cooperative partner according to the gain and loss of referring to the caching strategy of EBS in different regions.\n\n#Response to weakness 3\n##As we introduced in Section 3.1, we transform the problem into a slot-wise approach that can adapt to different cache sizes. According to our measurements, videos and their average requests show a long-tail distribution, and about 80% of video content has less than or equal to one request per day. Through simple filtering and screening, popular content can be stored in CDN to meet the requests of the vast majority of users, so as to effectively alleviate the storage pressure.\n\n#Response to weakness 5\n##During the formulation of the Problem, we consider replacing C contents in the cache each action, so the initial dimension of the state space is $C \\times F$. After we perform the slot-wise transformation, when cache misses, the features of the content in each slot are input into the popularity network for scoring, that is, the dimension of the network input vector is $1 \\times F$, and then the content with the lowest score is selected for replacement.\n\n#Response to weakness 6 and 7\n##Your suggestion has been adopted and the notation and description have been unified.\n\n#Response to weakness 8\n##We refined the presentation of the reward design section to reduce ambiguity. Delayed rewards in reinforcement learning refer to the situation where the consequence, or reward,  of an action is not immediately experienced but occurs after some delay.  In other words,  when an agent takes an action, it may not receive feedback or a reward immediately,  and there could be a temporal gap between the action and the corresponding outcome.  However, in the context of our problem, the RL Agent must have a corresponding reward after each action, and the problem of Delayed rewards may not exist here.\n\n#Response to weakness 9\n##The parameter of actor network of reference weight agent is the reference weight of EBS to each member in its partner list. The EBS not in partner list will not be referenced, and its reference weight will not be included in the actor network.
