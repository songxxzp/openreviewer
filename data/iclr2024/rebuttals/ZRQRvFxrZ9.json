This work might be more appropriate for application-oriented conferences such as WACV and ACMMM.\n2. The benchmark methods used in this study do not seem to represent the current SOTA on point cloud attacks. For example, ref. [1] [2] and likely there are more recently published works since then. A more thorough literature survey is needed.\n3. In any security systems, attack and defense are two sides of the same coin. I understand this paper is about attacks on point cloud. But without any discussion about the related attack detection problem on the defense side, I am worried about the scientific soundness.\n\n[1] Liu, Daizong, and Wei Hu. \"Imperceptible transfer attack and defense on 3d point cloud classification.\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence 45, no. 4 (2022): 4727-4746.\n[2] Tao, Yunbo, Daizong Liu, Pan Zhou, Yulai Xie, Wei Du, and Wei Hu. \"3DHacker: Spectrum-based Decision Boundary Generation for Hard-label 3D Point Cloud Attack.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 14340-14350. 2023."

                    "value": "Object detection using point clouds is essential for several fields, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. The voxel-based approach to represent 3D point clouds has been favored for its efficiency and effectiveness. However, there is a growing awareness of the susceptibility of deep learning models to adversarial attacks, and the robustness of voxel-based point cloud object detectors hasn't been thoroughly investigated. The current adversarial strategies against point cloud data typically entail creating phantom obstacles, erasing objects, or inducing false predictions. Although effective, these methods face three key challenges. Firstly, they are designed for manipulating point-based representations and are not suitable for voxel-based ones. Secondly, altering points across the entire scene leads to unnecessary and excessive perturbations. Thirdly, the assessments are mostly done on smaller datasets like KITTI, which don't necessarily extrapolate well to larger scales. To overcome these issues, the authors introduce a new gradient-based sparse voxel attack (GSVA) algorithm tailored for voxel-based 3D point cloud object detectors. They have developed two innovative frameworks: the re-voxelization-based voxel attack framework and the light voxel attack framework, which specifically target voxel-based representations rather than the original point data. The paper'ss extensive testing on larger-scale datasets, such as nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset, in addition to KITTI, showcases the strength of their sparse attack algorithm."
