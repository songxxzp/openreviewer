                    "value": "This paper proposes new classes of spanning trees named central spanning tree (CST) and branched central spanning tree (BCST) problems. CSTs can be considered as a continuous interpolation (with parameter $\\alpha$) of well-known minimum spanning trees (mST) ($\\alpha=0$) and the traditional minimum routing cost trees (MRCT) ($\\alpha=1$) where the sum of distances of all vertex pairs are minimized. BCST is the same as CST except that an additional branching point called Steiner point (SP) can be introduced, and it can be considered as a generalization of Steiner tree problem. This paper empirically reveals the robustness of CSTs against noise in graph data and theoretically investigates the possible topologies for BCSTs. Also, this paper proposes a heuristic algorithm for CST and BCST problem and empirically validated the optimality."

                    "value": "The introduced problems, CST and BCST problems, are currently less meaningful in both theoretical or practical senses than the existing problems. To introduce a new problem, it is desired that at least one of the following points are realized:\n\n(I) The newly introduced problem has a strength or offers a trade-off compared to the existing problems.\n(II) The newly introduced problem introduces a new better solution/insight on the existing problems.\n\nRegarding (I), it is empirically confirmed that the CST is robust against data perturbations, but the MRCT is also robust against data noise. So, I expected that the CST problem can be solved more easily than the MRCT problem. However, judging from the content, this is not the case: the CST is NP-hard for $\\alpha>0$ (Appendix C), and the performance of the proposed heuristics (mSTreg) has no clear correspondence to the $\\alpha$ value (Appendix N), meaning that the MRCT problem can be solved to the same extent as the CST/BCST problem. Therefore, I have found no significant advantage of the proposed CST/BCST problems over MRCT problem.\n\nRegarding (II), the heuristics for solving CST/MRCT problems is proposed (mSTreg) and it is applied to the existing problems, Steiner tree problem and MRCT problem. However, for Steiner tree problem, only instances such that the optimal solution is known are used as benchmarks. For MRCT problem, the proposed mSTreg falls short of the existing algorithm GRASP_PR. Although the authors claim that GRASP_PR is time-consuming because of heavy local search and it can be improved by using mSTreg for preprocessing, it is not verified through experiments. Therefore, currently the proposed heuristics, mSTreg, beats the existing methods only for the newly proposed CST/BCST problems.\n\nMinor comment:\nRegarding the final point, the computational time is also a key factor for the performance analysis of heuristic algorithms. I have read the per-iteration complexity and the time-measuring experiment in Appendix K, but I think at least a statement for computational time should be described on the main part of the problem. To the extent I understand, the per-iteration complexity is fairly small for graphs with 100 vertices and thus the proposed method runs much faster for the graphs used in the evaluation (Section 4.3). If the consumed time for the evaluation in Section 4.3 can be obtained and can be compared with the existing methods, they should be clearly stated."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out that our work is theoretically interesting. Next, we will address the concerns that were not covered in the main response.\n \n- **Advantages of CST over MRCT**: The consistent performance of mSTreg across diverse $\\alpha$ values stands out as a significant strength, aligning with our goal of creating a useful heuristic. Therefore, the point that the CST is as difficult to solve as the MRCT is secondary, as the CST has still valuable advantages over the MRCT. While MRCT's higher star-shape tendency enhances stability, it risks information loss, especially in higher dimensions, as depicted in Figure 12. The parameterized nature of $\\alpha$ in CST mitigates this, allowing for a tailored balance between robustness and data fidelity. This flexibility is particularly crucial in higher dimensions, where the CST's interpolation surpasses the limitations of MRCT. These observations underscore the superiority of the more general CST and its branched version, emphasizing their real-world applicability, specifically in higher dimensions. \n\n- **Increased number of iterations**: Adding more iterations to mSTreg may lower the tree cost. While our heuristic converges quickly, its inherent randomness permits additional exploration. As explained in Section 3, the same CST \"type\" topology can yield multiple full tree topologies. Consequently, when transforming the mST into a full tree topology, variations can emerge. Despite convergence, the randomness in this step may explore new topologies, further reducing the overall cost."

Thank you for pointing out this, and I will raise the score. However, it is still questionable that the CST/BCST problems can easily be solved than the MRCT problem; I think this is important since, judging from the main contents of this manuscript (without Appendix), the main focus of this manuscript is on the robustness of the spanning tree.\n\nRegarding the second point (II), thank you for conducting additional experiments that verify the performance of GRASP_PR initialized with the proposed mSTreg heuristics. I look the experimental results somewhat convincing, but it is still questionable that the long-time running results of GRASP_PR will be. In the additional experiments, the time limit is 5 minutes was set for the running time of GRASP_PR, and the results of GRASP_PR was worse than those of single mSTreg for many instances. Thus, I cannot imagine the results of GRASP_PR and GRASP_PR_mSTreg when more running time is given."

Rather, our argument centers on the observation that the parameterized CST/BCST exhibits more appealing properties than the MRCT. As a result, opting for the CST/BCST might be justified even if both are equally challenging to solve.\n\nRegarding the 5-minute time limit, we aimed to demonstrate that mSTreg can outperform the MRCT in terms of efficiency, while yielding satisfactory solutions. Notably, mSTreg, executed with just 20 iterations, produced a solution within seconds. In contrast, GRASP_PR did not consistently enhance this solution within the specified 5-minute timeframe. Extending the runtime of GRASP_PR would likely result in further improvements, as it would explore the solution space more extensively. It is important to emphasize that GRASP_PR, initialized with mSTreg, also adhered to the 5-minute time limit, surpassing the other two alternatives. This demonstrates the clear benefit of the combined approach and highlights how initializing with mSTreg can enhance GRASP_PR."

The main paper refers extensively to the appendices, which are 30 pages long. Some parts of the main paper are difficult to read without calling up the long version, particularly the optimization algorithm (section 4). Mention should also be made of the link with the minimum concave cost network flow problem, which helps to show that the problem is NP-hard: some elements are given in the main body, but the link can only be understood by carefully reading the appendix.\n\nThe main advantage of the proposed model is its robustness to noise. However, it is only compared with the minimum spanning tree (and the Steiner tree in the case where nodes can be added), which is known not to be robust to noise. However, competing algorithms are mentioned: some are even used as benchmarks to measure the accuracy of the heuristic. The paper's main motivation (robustness) should be more thoroughly documented.\n\nOn the same aspect, it would be relevant for the authors to cite and compare with the following papers:\n> Kasperski and Zielinski (TCS, 2010). On the approximability of robust spanning tree problems.\n\n> Bezrukov et al. (LNCS, 1996). On central spanning trees of a graph.\n\nThe parameter $\\alpha$ serves as a trade-off between noise robustness and data fidelity, but how do the authors choose it? For example, why was $\\alpha=0.8$ chosen for the simulations in Figure 2? The model may lose some of its interest if practitioners do not know how to select $\\alpha$ in their applications."

                        "value": "We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewer for their conscientious review.\n\n- **Presentation**: While we acknowledge the length of our Appendix, we believe it serves the purpose of providing comprehensive details for readers interested in a deeper understanding of our work. Our intention is to strike a balance between clarity in the main paper and the availability of detailed information in the Appendix. We contend that our manuscript does its best at conveying the most relevant information in the main part. Regarding the comprehension of our heuristic, we would value specific feedback on the aspects that may have been challenging, enabling us to make targeted improvements in the clarity of the section.\n\n- **Robustness discussion**: To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to delve into the robustness of the geometrical structure of a spanning tree in response to data perturbations, such as noise. We thank the reviewer for providing additional references. However, it's crucial to highlight that the robustness treated by these papers differs from ours. Bezrukov et al.'s paper, although related by name, focuses on computing a Frechet mean among all spanning trees of a graph using the symmetric difference of edge sets as a metric. The paper by Kasperski and Zielinski studies the mST with uncertain edge costs. Thus, they aim to find a tree whose cost is robust under different realizations of the edge costs. Thus, both papers neglect the geometrical stability of the tree. Consequently, our comparison only included the mST and the MRCT, as these are natural limits of our CST proposal. Note that, though the MRCT already existed previously in the literature, its robustness, as explained here, had not been mentioned before. Moreover, as discussed in  \"Advantages of CST over MRCT\"  (see response to H47r), the MRCT's robustness may cause an information loss in contrast to the parameterized CST. In light of this, we contend that our study effectively addresses the specific robustness considerations within our scope. Simultaneously, we acknowledge that our related work did not mention alternative robustness criteria, and we will amend this in the final version.\n\n- **Role of Steiner points (SPs)**: Indeed, your understanding of the SPs is right. Regarding the formulation of the optimization problem in (2), we posit that it is appropriately formulated. While (1) only minimizes over the set of spanning trees, (2) jointly minimizes both the trees and the SPs' positions, what from our perspective does not pose a conflict. (2) is equivalent to minimizing the SPs' positions given a fixed topology and subsequently selecting the topology that achieves the minimum cost. If there are specific aspects of (2) that are unclear or concerning, we would appreciate additional details to address them comprehensively. \n\n  Regarding the relevance of the Steiner points to model the structure, we acknowledge your valid point. Although SPs are not inherent to the original data, there are scenarios, where abstracting the data requires points that are not necessarily part of the raw data. For example, in many single-cell trajectory inference methods, it is common to define cluster centers (which are not part of the actual data) to describe the trajectory. Also in skeletonization the SPs become relevant as argued below in response \"CST and Skeleton\". We will emphasize these aspects in the final manuscript to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the applicability of the SPs.\n\n- **CST and Skeleton**: We exclusively utilized the BCST for skeletonization, primarily because it is often desired that the skeleton goes through the \"middle\" of the volume. The SPs in the BCST offer the flexibility to be situated in the volume's center, ensuring that the BCST skeleton traverses this central region. In contrast, the CST lacks this flexibility and would, at best, zigzag over surface points. Hence, the CST was not considered for this particular application.\n\n- **Case $\\alpha>1$**: Apart from the limit case detailed in Appendix D.1, we refrained from further exploration due to practical observations indicating an excessive star-shaped tree, even in low dimensions. For instance, the toy dataset in Figure 2 became a star tree for $\\alpha=1.15$. Regarding NP-hardness, it remains unproven in this regime as the strictly concavity argument applicable for $0<\\alpha\\leq1$ loses its validity. We hypothesize that in practice the problem might be generally easier to solve for higher $\\alpha$ values, especially considering that, for the BCST problem, the SPs tend to collapse into a single point."

The necessity of a new family of trees seems unconvincing.\n\nQ2. In Section 2, a single cell gene expression measurement example is provided.

Moreover, as mST cannot detect the trajectory bifurcation even on the original data, the example seems hard to support the superiority of proposed model regarding the robustness. \n\n\nQ3. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms are not well evaluated in the experiments. As mST can be computed efficiently in practice, it is unfair to propose a more complex tree model without considering the efficiency. It is better if the efficiency of the proposed algorithm could be compared with existing algorithms.\n\n\nQ4.

Next, we will address the concerns not covered in the main response.\n\n- **(Q2) CST on single cell data**: While CST may not fully capture the bifurcation, it does exhibit a discernible split, indicated by two wide edges. The fact that the mST is not able to detect the bifurcation, does not diminish the value of the robustness argument as the mST undergoes drastic changes post-perturbation, in contrast to the CST. This highlights the CST's superiority in terms of robustness, even if not optimal. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that BCST might be more suitable for such applications due to better trajectory representation and preservation. We remark, that this is not the only example we show; the Appendix illustrates another instance leading to the same conclusions.\n\n- **(Q4) Guarantees of the heuristic**: Currently, our heuristic lacks theoretical guarantees regarding the cost of the solutions it provides. However, through empirical evaluation, we have demonstrated that our heuristic consistently produces competitive solutions. It is worth noting that many algorithms employed for this class of problems rely on genetic algorithms or local search strategies, neither of which inherently provide any formal guarantee. While some algorithms may offer worst-case scenario bounds, they often struggle to scale effectively for large instance problems [1,2].\n\n[1] Ravelo et al., \"A PTAS for the metric case of the optimum weighted source\u2013destination communication spanning tree problem\", (2019).\n\n[2] Wu et al., \"Approximation algorithms for some optimum communication spanning tree problems\", (2000)."

This comes in the form of a parameterized framework where one weights the cost of an edge in the spanning tree according to its centrality in the spanning tree. The parameter (alpha) determines how strong this weighting is.\nThe motivating aspect that central spanning trees are more robust than spanning trees is supported by an empirical analysis.\nFor alpha=0 the problem coincides with the minimum spanning tree and for alpha=1 the problem coincides with the minimum routing cost tree.\nFor all alpha > 0 determining the minimum cost of a central spanning tree is NP-hard and hence the manuscript also includes a heuristic for it.\nAll these contributions are also extended to the setting in which non-terminal points are allowed in the tree (leading to analogues of the Steiner tree problem)."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out that our work is very natural and interesting.\n\n- **Section 2.1**: This section aimed to empirically assess the stability of the (B)CST against noise. We started with an initial sample, denoted as $P_0$, consisting of n=1000 points uniformly drawn from a rectangle. To investigate the impact of noise, we generated five perturbed samples $P_i$ by introducing zero-centered Gaussian noise, defined as $P_i = P_0 + \\Sigma_i$, where $i$ ranges from 1 to 5, and $\\Sigma_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1000\\times2}$ is a matrix with entries sampled independently from $\\mathcal{N}(0,0.005)$. Using the Frobenius norm $||\\cdot||_F$, we assessed robustness by comparing the shortest path distance matrices between trees computed by (B)CST at different $\\alpha$ values over original and perturbed samples. In other words, for each $i\\in {1,...,5}$, we computed the norm $||D_0^{\\alpha}-D_i^{\\alpha}||_F$, where $D_i^{\\alpha}$ is the shortest path distance matrix of the (B)CST applied to $P_i$ at a certain $\\alpha$ value. Figure 2a) presents the average Frobenius norm across $\\alpha$ along with the average total length of the trees. The plot illustrates a decrease in the Frobenius norm, indicating increased similarity and greater robustness to perturbations with rising $\\alpha$, albeit at the cost of longer edges. We hope this clarifies the experiment's setup.\n- **(B)CST for more general graphs**: The CST easily generalizes to non-complete Euclidean graphs by considering their spanning trees. Analogously, the BCST could be generalized by considering full topologies derivable from the non-complete graph spanning trees. Yet, our heuristic faces challenges in this extension, as the mST step might yield a spanning tree, which is not a subgraph of the original graph. Ensuring the topology's validity in each iteration is non-trivial and therefore is left for future work. Additionally, our work briefly explores extending the (B)CST to Riemannian manifolds, addressing in Appendix H.4 the degree four Steiner points infeasibility on 2-dimensional manifolds. We recognize the heuristic's potential extension to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds pending efficient computation of Steiner points. Notably, CST, unlike BCST, can be defined over weighted graphs withtout requiring embedding in a metric space. However, our heuristic is irrelevant in this context, as the relation with BCST cannot be exploited."

My question about extending central spanning trees to non-metric or non-clique graphs is answered to my satisfaction, and so is that about the setup in the toy data set. I am somewhat surprised that only one starting point set was chosen which I think could have been increased to a higher number for a more reliable interpretation of the experiment's outcome but as not too much focus is put on this experiment and more real-data pointsets are included, I do not see this as a major concern but something that could be improved in the future."

Of course the figures you make to show the influence of alpha make sense to depict for one specific $P_0$ but in terms of experimental setup one would want to exclude that the initial point set was just a lucky pick. The same applies to each distribution in Appendix A."
