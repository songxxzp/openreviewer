                    "value": "The paper introduces a method for sampling protein structures with desired dynamic properties. This method builds on prior work in protein structure diffusions and computational analysis of protein dynamics. The primary contribution is a novel loss function for dynamics guidance. This loss function using normal mode analysis (NMA) to extract target displacement vectors per residue and then uses a differentiable NMA implementation to guide sampling towards the structures with displacements close to the targets. The authors present 27 conditional samples, which display loss values considerably lower than unconditional samples and self-consistency numbers to suggest that the sampled structures are designable."

                    "value": "The methodological and experimental contributions are both relatively minor. \n\nMethodology:\n\nThe method combines classifier guidance on a Gaussian diffusion (Ho et al. 2020) with a NMA-derived loss function. Section 3.1 could be included in Section 2, as it is established and common to use a delta function centered at the denoiser's mean to perform guidance, and it is not unique to the paper. There also doesn't appear to be anything novel about the approach to NMA besides porting numpy code to pytorch. The contribution is the synthesis of NMA with classifier guidance, and the addition of a structure guidance term. \n\nExperimental:\n\nNovel methodology is not necessary for a significant contribution when a simple method can be convincingly shown to work well. This paper could be in this category, but I think the current results are fairly limited. Showing that guidance leads to lower loss values is more of a sanity check than a full result. Ideally the authors would demonstrate that the samples have the desired dynamics with a compelling independent evaluation. In this case, such an evaluation is obviously a challenging task, as it would require something like expensive molecular dynamics simulations or actual lab work, but establishing a compelling evaluation framework could be a very impactful contribution in itself. Likewise, it's a bit hard to know what scTM > 0.5 actually signifies, even though it has been used in prior work. Ultimately these structures would have to expressed as sequences. Are there compelling samples for those sequences such that these protein hinges could actually be created? It might be helpful to show that (1) the guidance method generalizes to the outcomes we really care about, not simply the proxy objective (2) there are high likelihood sequences that can (a) be expressed (b) have the desired dynamics."

I would strongly prefer if the dynamics of some other calibrated system could be shown in these plots, as the units and density are quite difficult to interpret.\n\nFigure 3 - I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to be looking for. What does a \u201cbad\u201d sample look like?\n\nThe filtering in section 5.1 is very ambiguous: \u201cAt the start, we filter out the \u2018low quality\u2019 samples whose mean chain distance is outside [3.75, 3.85]\u201d What fraction were filtered out? \u201cOccasionally the conditional sampling will \u2018blow up\u2019, which has been generally observed in many conditional diffusion models.\u201d What does \u2018blow up\u2019 mean?

The problem itself is novel and very interesting, but the solution is more or less the standard guidance framework with a new loss. Authors say that their approach could potentially be applied to other diffusion models, it would be nice to test at least a couple for this. Most validation is done by the same NMA loss that is used for guidance. So its unsurprising that guiding using a loss decreases it. So it would be nice to have more diverse validation metrics for the flexibility. Although admittedly I don't know what would be such better metrics. Maybe molecular dynamics literature has some suggestions?"

In [1] there is a proposed architecture to generate sets of eigenvectors for graph Laplacians from a given distribution. While its a slightly different problem to what you were talking about, that architecture could potentially be used to generate eigenvectors for symmetric matrices without re-training as long as the training distribution matches the test matrices you feed.\n\n[1] Martinkus, Karolis, et al. \"Spectre: Spectral conditioning helps to overcome the expressivity limits of one-shot graph generators.\"\n\n### After Rebuttal\nI read all the reviews and author answers.

The first point is in my view particularly important, because as it stands, it is difficult to read from the paper whether the method is generating: 1) protein sequence and structure, 2) protein backbone structure conditioned on sequence length, 3) protein structure conditioned on sequence, 4) protein backbone structure conditioned on nothing at all. It is to some extent possible to deduce these details from the conducted experiments, but I think this information should be stated more explicitly in the paper. Regarding technical details, these are more minor things that would make the paper easier to read. For details on both, see the questions below.\n\nRelated to the above, it would also benefit the paper if the authors briefly stated how they envision their approach to be useful in practice. If we have information about dynamics that we wish to impose on generated samples, we are presumably in a fairly constrained setting, where we wish to resample only parts of a protein. What are the advantages to conditioning a diffusion model on dynamics compared to for instance just using normal mode analysis (or coarse grained molecular dynamics) to generate a structural ensemble, and then use a model to predict amino acid identities conditioned on structure (i.e. some inverse folding model)?\n\nFinally, the empirical evaluation of the method could have been stronger. Some of the results are primarily based on qualitative comparisons by-eye, or otherwise restricted to very specific motions. Clarification is also needed for some of the experimental setup (see details below)."

                    "value": "Page 3, eq (4)\nAs far as I could see, z has not been introduced. Is this just a sample from a unit normal? Please clarify.\n\nPage 3, eq (6)\nIsn't there an \"x\" missing on the right hand side?\n\nPage 3. \"Related work on Diffusion Probabilistic Models in protein context.\"\nAt this stage in the paper, after the general background on diffusion models, I would have expected a section on the specific modelling tasks that you intend to solve in this paper. Instead, you jump directly to related work, mentioning e.g. amino acid point clouds, which have not been defined. One solution could be move the related work to appear later in the paper, and go direclty to \"3 Methods\", but even that section does not give a complete description of what you are modelling (it introduces y_D, but not what x is, and how the amino acid identities appear in the model). For intance, if x is purely backbone structure, does that include all backbone atoms, or only C_alphas?\n\nPage 3. \"K \u2208 R 3N\u00d73Nis interaction constants matrix\"\nWhat is an interaction constants matrix? Is it derived from a force field? (EDIT: I see you have some info on this later, but would be good to clarify this when first mentioning NMA).\n\nPage 4. \"generate a new protein\"\nWhat exactly do you mean by \"generating\" a protein. Are we talking about both sequence and structure, conditioned on sequence length?\n\nPage 4. eq (8)\nWhy is there no weighting factor (aka temperature) on the loss term? In other words, why would you expect this to be 1? \n\nPage 5, \"x_C_M \\in ... is the expected positions of conditioned residues at t=0 as sampling progresses\"\nThis sentence was confusing to me. Doesn't \"sampling progresses\" imply a \"t\" different from \"t=0\" (and at t=0, don't you know the position?). And in this case, shouldn\u2019t this expected position be subscripted with a time t?\n\nPage 6. \"mean chain distance\"\nThis is not clearly defined. From the reference value of 3.8, I assume this is the average CA-CA distance. Does this imply that you model the protein only at C_alpha resolution? If so, I would have expected this to be stated as part of the original model specification.\n\nPage 7. \"sample novel proteins using\"\nAgain, are you sampling both structure and sequence here?\n\nPage 7. \"For each sample, we obtain 8 ProteinMPNN generated sequences with ESMFold (Lin et al., 2022) design for each\"\nThis seems to suggest that \"generating proteins\" means only backbone coordinates, such that you need to fill in sequences using ProteinMPNN. But this sentence should probably be rewritten, since it is unclear what \"with ESMFold (Lin et al., 2022) design for each\" means. As far as I know ESMFold predicts structures, which is also consistent with the following sentences - but what does \"design\" then mean here? This should be clarified.\n\nPage 7. \"Occasionally the conditional sampling will \u2018blow up\u2019, which has been generally observed in many conditional diffusion models (Lou & Ermon, 2023)\"\nDoes the rate of blowing up depend on the \"guidance scale\" used during sampling?\n\nPage 7. \"Figure 3 shows a pair of conditional and unconditional samples for one of the strain targets (additional sampled pairs are in Appendix E)\"\nCouldn\u2019t this be quantified rather than verified through visual inspection on just a few targets?\n\n\n### Minor comments:\n\nPage 2, \"as well as we perform the visual inspection.\"\nSomething is wrong in this sentence. Rephrase.\n\nFigure 1, caption. \"Bottom row: corresponding proteins synthesised with Genie\"\nWhat does the word \u201ccorresponding\u201d imply? Are they conditioned on something similar?\n\nFigure 1, caption. \"Arrows are not to scale with respect to the entire protein\"\nPerhaps make this statement more precise by saying that arrows have been scaled up for increased visual clarity.\n\nPage 3, \"by the equivalence \u2207x...\"\nThis identify was not immediately apparent. I realize that it just requires a few steps , but for completeness it would be helpful if you could include the derivation of this in an appendix, or otherwise include a reference where this is done.\n\nPage 5. \"and expected displacements matrix v(x)\"\nI assume this means expected according to the NMA analysis, but perhaps state explicitly."
