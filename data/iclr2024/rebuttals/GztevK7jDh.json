The approximation in Eq. (3) further assumes that each agent can determines its own subtask based on its local observation, which is not rational since effective subtask assignment requires global knowledge.\n\n(d) The novelty in algorithm design is a little limited, by introducing a subtask learner in QMIX. The subtask learner design is based on VQ-VAE, and the hypernetwork idea has also been adopted in QMIX.\n\n(e) QMIX itself has some drawbacks as it assumes that the global Q-value grows monotonically with individual ones.

                        "value": "Thanks for your comments. LSVQ is a generic method that can be integrated with various MARL algorithms. As shown in Figure 2, the backbone MARL methods can be QMIX as well as Weighted QMIX, QPLEX, MAPPO, LICA, and so on. LSVQ introduces a subtask learner, which selects a subtask for the agent based on its observation. Then, LSVQ modifies the structure of the policy network, which additionally takes the agent's subtask as input to facilitate coordination. Under the setting of Dec-POMDP, LSVQ has to do subtask assignment with only individual observations available. Therefore, LSVQ maps the observation to latent space, and uses the latent vectors to reconstruct the true global state during training, which can be viewed as maximizing the mutual information $\\mathcal{I}(s;\\boldsymbol{z})$. In this way, the global information is injected into the latent vectors, and agents can infer the global state by selecting subtask $z_i$ based on its observation.\n\nQ1: Could you give more explanation on the statement from Section 1: \"Nevertheless, these approaches aim to build differentiated subtask representations but neglect the information that ought to be incorporated within the subtask?\n\nA1: We assert that a good subtask representation should be informative. This objective can be formalized as maximizing the mutual information $\\mathcal{I}(s;\\boldsymbol{z})$, which implies that the subtask representation can help to infer the global state. Only with the guide of global information can agents divide up the task and cooperate effectively. In previous works like LDSA, the subtask encoder is updated via complex loss function to make the representations of different subtasks distinguishable, but there is no global information included in to facilitate agents' coordination. This is where LSVQ makes improvements.\n\nQ2: It would be better to include discussion and comparisons with related works on multi-agent skill (a.k.a., option) discovery.\n\nA2: We briefly introduce some related subtask-based studies in Section 1. A more detailed related work section will be included in the future edition.\n\nQ3: Could you explain why $q(z|o_a)$ is designed to be deterministic rather than a distribution on all subtasks?\n\nA3: We calculate $q(z|o_a)$ deterministically because we adopt vector quantization to learn the subtask representations. The representations of $K$ subtasks are saved in a codebook with shape $K\\times D$ where $D$ is the dimension of representation. The observation $o_a$ is quantized to a $D$-dimensional vector, and the index of its nearest neighbor vector in the codebook corresponds to the selected subtask. This step of calculating the nearest neighbor makes $q(z|o_a)$ deterministic. Vector quantization offers many benefits. It guarantees distinguishable subtask representations, without the need for an additional loss function to control the discrepancy between them like other subtask-based methods do. It enables agents to select various subtasks in different stages and situations, as well as prevents the agent from frequently changing the selected subtasks in an episode, which could lead to unstable training.\n\nQ4: The results reported in the original paper of LDSA are clearly better than the ones shown in this paper, e.g. results on \"5m_6m\" and \"3s5z_3s6z\".\n\nA4: We tested LDSA with the official code released on Openreview. The difference is that in the original paper, the version of the StarCraftII game engine is 4.10. In our experiments, we use version 4.6.2 instead. Experiments in previous studies show that version 4.6.2 is more challenging, with a drop in algorithm performance observed in most scenarios. This is the reason for the discrepancy in the results of LDSA."

Empirically, the improvements brought by LSVQ are not significant, such as Fig. 7, Fig. 10, and Fig. 11. I would suggest involving more information for the sub-task decomposition and integrating LSVQ with multiple MARL algorithm to show the broad applicability and effectiveness of LSVQ. I would slightly improve my score."

A variational autoencoder variant is employed to reconstruct the global state from individual observations. The latent encoder vector is discretized via vector quantization before being used by the decoder for reconstruction. The learned latent vectors are used to generate individual policies for all agents belonging to a subtask, using hypernetworks. The approach, called Learn Subtask representations via Vector Quantization (LSVQ), can be integrated into any MARL framework. It is evaluated in a variety of settings in SMAC, particle environments, and Google Research Football and compared with state-of-the-art MARL approaches."

Wen et al., \"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is A Sequence Modeling Problem\", NeurIPS 2022\n\n**Soundness**\n\nIn contrast to stated in the paper, general Dec-POMDPs have **stochastic** observations [4,5] and are therefore sampled from a distribution instead of being projected via a deterministic function. The benchmark domains used in the paper are all special cases with deterministic observations (and even initial states) thus do not reflect the general characteristics of a general Dec-POMDP [5].\n\n[4] F. Oliehoek et al., \"A Concise Introduction to Decentralized POMDPs\", 2016\n\n[5] X. Lyu et al., \"A Deeper Understanding of State-Based Critics in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", AAAI 2022\n\nAccording to [4], the global state cannot be reconstructed from observations alone. However, in Dec-MDPs (a special case of Dec-POMDP), the reconstruction is possible. Thus, I am not sure about the general validity of the proposed approach.\n\n**Significance and Clarity**\n\nThe x-axes vary for different scenarios in Figures 3, 4, and 6 (either 2 million steps or 5 million), which is somewhat confusing. I wonder how the plots would look like, if the plots with only 2 million steps were run until 5 million steps as there could be a chance that the baselines outperform LSVQ in the long run.\n\nIn the maps `5m_vs_6m`, `MMM2`, and `27m_vs_30m`, QMIX performs worse than reported in the original introduction of the benchmark [7]. Furthermore, since the original SMAC authors consider SMAC to be outdated themselves [8], I suggest to evaluate on the newer SMACv2, which exhibits more stochasticity and better aligns with the general Dec-POMDP setting.\n\n[7] M. Samvelyan et al, \"The StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge\", AAMAS 2019\n\n[8] B. Ellis et al., \"SMACv2: An Improved Benchmark for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\", 2022\n\n**Minor**\n\n- Some plots only show red and green lines. This is bad for colorblind readers who cannot distinguish between those lines. I suggest to change one of these colors to blue."

This technique is independent of the structures of the observation encoder or the value mixing network. LSVQ can be easily integrated with other methods such as QPLEX [1] and MAAC [2] and make further improvements based on their advanced modules. Therefore, we mainly compare LSVQ with other subtask-based methods in Section 1. A detailed related work section will be included in the future edition.\n\nQ2: General Dec-POMDPs have\u00a0stochastic\u00a0observations [3,4] and are sampled from a distribution instead of being projected via a deterministic function. The benchmark domains used in the paper are all special cases with deterministic observations (and even initial states) thus do not reflect the general characteristics of a general Dec-POMDP [4]. According to [3], the global state cannot be reconstructed from observations alone. The reviewer is not sure about the general validity of the proposed approach.\n\nA2: Although the observation function $\\mathcal{O}$ can be stochastic, each agent would receive a sampled observation that could reflect the original distribution to a certain extent, and LSVQ can still work in such situations. Theoretically, the global state cannot be reconstructed perfectly from observations, but fortunately the global state is available during training. According to Figure 1, we assume the input of the subtask learner is the global state and consider the individual observations as vectors that have been processed by different channels. The global state is mapped into the latent space, then LSVQ attempts to reconstruct the global state based on the latents. The state reconstruction using latents is even harder than using observations alone, but as the quality of reconstruction improves with training, the latents become more informative as the mutual information $\\mathcal{I}(s;\\boldsymbol{z})$ increases. So the latents can serve as good subtask representations.\n\nQ3: The x-axes vary for different scenarios in Figures 3, 4, and 6, which is somewhat confusing. I wonder how the plots would look like, if the plots with only 2 million steps were run until 5 million steps as there could be a chance that the baselines outperform LSVQ in the long run.\n\nA3: For experiments on SMAC, most studies follow this setting: 5 million steps for the most difficult scenarios, and 2 million steps for others. For example, in *27m_vs_30m*, curves begin to rise at 500k steps, and 2 million steps are enough to predict the trends of the learning curves in practice. In *corridor*, curves rise from about 1.5 million steps, so 5 million steps is a proper setting. The learning curves would always stay the trend if the training continues.\n\nQ4: In the maps\u00a0*5m_vs_6m*,\u00a0*MMM2*, and\u00a0*27m_vs_30m*, QMIX performs worse than reported in [5]. The reviewer suggests to evaluate on the newer SMACv2 [6], which exhibits more stochasticity and better aligns with the general Dec-POMDP setting.\n\nA4: Results on SMACv2 will be available in the appendix in the future edition.\n\n[1] S.

                        "value": "Q1: The reviewer is concerned about the novelty of this paper. It seems that HSL shares the similar idea of this paper.\n\nA1: We have read the original paper of HSL and found that HSL is quite different from LSVQ but has a lot in common with other methods. HSL encodes the one-hot vector of skill-id $z_j$ to the latent representation space and introduces a learning objective to make the representations of different skill-ids distinguishable. This approach shares the same idea with LDSA [1], **with little global information in the representation**. The skill selecting process and the loss used to update the skill selector in HSL are also very similar to those in RODE [2]. The overall loss function includes several regularization terms, and **additional hyperparameters are needed for balancing the loss terms**. Instead, LSVQ integrates both the subtask encoding and subtask assignment into the VQ-VAE framework, which has a more solid theoretical foundation and naturally avoids generating identical representations for distinct subtasks. As described in Section 3.2 of our paper, the overall loss function is concise with few additional hyperparameters.\n\nQ2: The proposed method should be integrated into more advanced algorithms in MARL.\n\nA2: We integrated LSVQ with QMIX and MADDPG in our experiments to show the compatibility of LSVQ with both value decomposition methods and multi-agent actor-critic methods. There are two reasons for not using more advanced algorithms. First, as the baselines [1,2,3,4] use QMIX for value mixing, LSVQ keeps consistent with them for fairness. Second, the effectiveness of LSVQ is reflected in two aspects: whether it is superior to other subtask-based methods, and how much it improves the original algorithm (e.g., LSVQ-QMIX improves QMIX). Therefore, we think it is not necessary to integrate LSVQ with more advanced methods. But we agree that it would be better if we display the results of LSVQ-MAPPO instead of LSVQ-MADDPG in the ablation study.\n\nQ3: In the reviewer's opinion, the scale of the LSVQ-QMIX ought to be shrinked rather than enlarging the scale of QMIX for comparison.\n\nA3: We follow previous studies [1,3] which also enlarge the scale of QMIX for ablation studies. As shown in Figure 2(a) in our paper, the MLP, GRU, and the mixing network are exactly the same as those in QMIX. The design of the subtask learner follows the principle of simplicity, and further reduction of parameters can lead to insufficient network fitting capability. Therefore, we consider increasing the QMIX network for ablation to be reasonable.\n\nQ4: In Figure 10, the results of LSVQ-QMIX against other baselines on GRF scenarios are not satisfactory compared with LDSA. Reasons for performance degradation should be analyzed and provided.\n\nA4: Thank you for your careful reading of our paper. We apologize for not providing an analysis of this phenomenon. The most common reason is that different tasks require different capabilities of algorithms. For example, QMIX shows stable performances in many scenarios, but it fails in *corridor* which requires sufficient exploration. To remedy this, the exploration rate in QMIX needs to be increased [5]. The design of LDSA may be better suited to GRF scenarios, but it couldn't outperform LSVQ in overall performance. Further study on the GRF results would certainly help us to understand and improve LSVQ in greater depth.\n\nQ5: Subtask assignment is related to the overall situation as well as observation. For example, there exist two identical agents which can both do task A and task B. Under the settings of decentralization, the two agents will do the same task, while we want them to do these two tasks, respectively.\n\nA5: In our implementation, an agent's observation includes its agent-id, so the observations of two agents cannot be the same even if they are homogeneous. Follow the example in Q5, each agent can add its agent-id to its observation and the two agents can finally learn a joint policy to perform different subtasks based on their agent-ids. Therefore, two decentralized agents with identical external observations can still do different subtasks if necessary.\n\n[1] Yang, Mingyu, et al. \"Ldsa: Learning dynamic subtask assignment in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 1698-1710.\n\n[2] Wang, Tonghan, et al. \"Rode: Learning roles to decompose multi-agent tasks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.01523 (2020).\n\n[3] Wang, Tonghan, et al. \"Roma: Multi-agent reinforcement learning with emergent roles.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.08039 (2020).\n\n[4] Mahajan, Anuj, et al. \"Maven: Multi-agent variational exploration.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n\n[5] Rashid, Tabish, et al. \"Weighted qmix: Expanding monotonic value function factorisation for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning.\"\u00a0Advances in neural information processing systems\u00a033 (2020): 10199-10210."

                        "value": "Q1: Is it possible to study how entangled the latent representations and sub-tasks are? Do authors see a way in which disentanglement could help here?\n\nA1: This is an interesting perspective. We are not familiar with the area of disentanglement, so we took a brief look at it. The subtasks and representations are a one-to-one match, and it is more practical to study how entangled the latent representations and the global state are. In previous subtask-based methods [1,2], an additional regularization term is needed to make the representations of distinct subtasks distinguishable. Meanwhile, disentanglement helps to learn mutually independent subtask representations, which can replace the regularization term mentioned above and implicitly increase the discrepancy between representations with a more solid theoretical foundation. Existing disentanglement methods mainly focus on VAEs, and further study is required to combine disentanglement with VQ-VAE in our paper.\n\nQ2: How much tuning is needed and how difficult is it to find the right sub-task representation size for each method?\n\nA2: In our experiments, we found that LSVQ is very stable and insensitive to its hyperparameters. Theoretically, the number of subtasks $K$ corresponds to the number of distinct policies. A small $K$ would restrict the variety of the agents' behaviors, while a large $K$ leads to over-specialization of the strategy and unstable performances of agents. As shown in Appendix B.1, we set $K=8$ in all the scenarios across different environments and get promising results. Users can tune $K$ if necessary, but $K=8$ is a moderate choice and works well.\n\n[1] Yang, Mingyu, et al. \"Ldsa: Learning dynamic subtask assignment in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 1698-1710.\n\n[2] Liu, Yuntao, et al. \"Heterogeneous Skill Learning for Multi-agent Tasks.\"\u00a0Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems\u00a035 (2022): 37011-37023."
