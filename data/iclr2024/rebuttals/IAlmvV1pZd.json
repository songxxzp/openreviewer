The proposed algorithm, L-MBOP-E, is evaluated in comparison to two other model-based offline RL methods, MBOP and MOPP, on  several tasks from the D4RL and DMC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that L-MBOP-E outperforms other model-based offline planning methods."

Although the authors claim in the introduction that \"we advocate a low-dimensional latent representation for the state space, which can yield a higher accuracy dynamics model and in turn improve prediction quality and hence reduce the likelihood of compounding errors,\" there are no experimental results or relevant papers to support this view.\n\n2. In visual model-based RL, the latent world model has already been widely used. The latent model proposed by the author, apart from replacing Dreamer's RSSM with MLP, has no fundamental difference from Dreamer [1]. Moreover, Dreamer also supports experiments with state input. Thus, I believe that merely claiming the use of a latent model in offline RL lacks novelty.\n\n3. The biggest issue with this paper is that it does not explain how the extrinsic policy used for exploration is trained or what dataset is used. If it's merely learning a policy online in the same environment, this undoubtedly constitutes cheating in the offline setting. If a policy is learned from a different environment, how can one avoid the model error caused by the unseen actions selected by this policy during offline planning?\n\n4. The paper doesn't compare with model-based offline RL methods which also aim to solve inaccurate models and overly conservative, such as MOPO [2], MORel [3], COMBO [4], and CBOP [5]. \n\n\nReference:\n\n[1].

                    "value": "1. In the section \"Behavior Policy and Value Function Learning in the Latent Space,\" the authors did not use common methods like CQL [1] to train the critic. So, how does this critic avoid overestimation or underestimation for unseen state-action pairs?\n\n2. I am curious about the comparison with uncertain regularized planning methods. The paper does not mention this, but using a model/critic ensemble to guide exploration or to avoid high error areas during the rollout/planning process is already a standard practice [2] [3].\n\n3. The paper claims that the proposed latent model can be used for zero-shot adaptation, but PlaNet's world model can as well. Therefore, I strongly recommend that the authors add a comparison with PlaNet [4].\n\nReference:\n\n[1]. Conservative Q-Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning.

However, in general such an extrinsic policy could be hard to obtain in many realistic settings.\n\nThe usage of latent dynamics model is over-claimed as a novel contribution. The application of latent dynamics models shows significant gain in the experiments. However, given the related model-based RL works such as PlaNet, Dreamer (v1-v3), TDMPC, the learning objective of the latent dynamics model is not novel at all. \n\nA primary advantage of latent dynamics models is their ability to facilitate learning from high-dimensional pixel observations. The absence of visual offline reinforcement learning experiments in the current study is a notable omission, representing a significant constraint of the experimental framework. However, no visual offline RL experiments are conducted in the paper. This is a major limitation of the experiments. Furthermore, many other recent offline RL algorithms are not compared. (See Questions for details.)"

                    "value": "1. I don\u2019t get this sentence, which describes the difference between the proposed method and the prior latent dynamics model based approach \u201cDifferent from the above approaches, L-MBOP-E employs a state decoder, \u2026\u201d.  Why is the latent dynamics model objective claimed to be novel? Dreamer-v2/PlaNet also employs a state decoder, and it proposes a recurrent RSSM based dynamics model to deal with partial observability in the latent space. Neither the learning objective nor the architecture in this paper is novel.\n\n2. Why not jointly learn policy & value functions and latent dynamics models instead of relying on state decoder/reconstruction? The usage of a state decoder is in fact a big limitation here because this objective actually tries to model every dimension of the input without taking into account which dimensions are more important and which dimensions are not. This is exactly the value-equivalent principle in model-based RL [1,2], and part of the reason why TDMPC also learns a Q function on top of the embedding spaces, which can serve to shape the representation. So the latent representations learned in this approach could be highly suboptimal.\n3. Some recent offline RL algorithms such as [5][6][7][8] are ignored in the comparison.\n4. (**More important**) Empirical evaluations of offline visual RL should be conducted. [9][10][11] are all recent works on visual offline RL that should be compared and discussed in the paper.\n\nReferences:\n- [1] Grimm et al., The Value Equivalence Principle for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, NeurIPS 2020.\n- [2] Amir-Massoud Farahmand et al., Value-Aware Loss Function for Model-based Reinforcement Learning Amir-Massoud, AISTATS 2018\n- [5] Kostrikov et al.

Unfortunately, I find that the paper as written has significant issues in this regard:\n* While the motivation stated in the paper is that \u201cthe extrinsic policy can be a meta-learned policy or a policy learned from another similar RL task\u201d, the experiments do not explore either of these possibilities at all. Instead, \u201cFor convenience, the extrinsic policy is obtained as a variant by training a policy using SAC on the same task until it performs reasonably well as the BC policy.\u201d It is not clear why in practice one would have such a policy, nor how it would be similar to a meta-learned policy or a policy from another task, so the experiments do not reflect the intended use case of the proposed algorithm.\n* The use of Thompson sampling is not properly ablated. The authors show that Thompson sampling tends to prefer the stronger algorithm (which is not surprising), but the impact of this sampling bias on overall algorithm performance is not shown. A simple baseline would be to always sample $N/2$ rollouts from each policy, then apply the MPPI trajectory optimizer as before."

Did you experiment with anything like this?"
