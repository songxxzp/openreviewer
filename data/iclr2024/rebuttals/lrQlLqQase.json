                    "value": "The review will be contained to this section owing to the flow in which it was conducted.\n\n### Abstract\n\n- I think you are being a bit unfair to the research community with your first sentence; there is plenty of work which considers causal reasoning in time, it is a basic tenet of causality (see Hume). Or I may have misunderstood the claim. Please explain or re-write.\n\n### Introduction\n\n- \"If cause event A had not occurred, effect event B would not have occurred\" this sentence does not make grammatical sense.\n- \"However, these approaches can have severe limitations, especially when applied to dynamical systems\" - what are these limitations? Pearl has multiple works on dynamical plans, clearly then it is feasible to use his SCM for studying dynamics, hence please be more precise with your critique or shortcomings of his and Spirtes' approach.\n- \"Interventions are often infeasible in physical systems\" - why is that? There are plenty of works to the contrary.\n- \"Moreover, these approaches ignore the dynamics as well as the possibility of other interventions between events\" - but there's plenty of work in this area, see e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08784.pdf\n- \"Further, these frameworks assume knowledge of causal dependencies or structural information between various events in the system\" but that is the core assumption of causal inference (notwithstanding causal discovery) that the causal diagram is known and usually that causal sufficiency holds at that. How can that be a critique of causal modelling in a paper about: causal modelling? Again, please elucidate on what you mean in this context.\n- Very interesting third paragraph re: Salmon's work.\n- I do not follow, are you suggesting that the example 'smoking causes lung cancer' is a poorly understood cause-effect relationship? Or are you suggesting that there are other causes which are not modelled by that same model?\n- This seems like a contradiction wouldn't you agree: \"real-world experiments conducted on simulated data\". \n\n### Basics and problem formulation\n\n- \"Any dynamical system can be described from the state viewpoint\" this is categorically not true using Kalman's definition, for chaotic dynamics.\n- Your first paragraph is essentially a re-statement of Pearl's SCM.\n- What is a \"filtered probability space\" with emphasis on _filtered_?\n- \"More formally, under sufficient smoothness conditions\" - and what are these conditions?\n-  Why would limits (1) and (2) exist? Where do they come from? What is the reasoning? What's the deduction of their existence?\n- Under process-based causality, I feel that several references are amiss. Yes those axioms (I and II) are mostly true (though (i) appears not to be within the space of quantum dynamics but let's not go there) but they would do well to be referenced. Hume argued the temporal priority principle a couple of hundred years ago, so this is nothing new and hence should be placed within the literature. Where does (iii) come from?\n- You haven't specified what 'HP' stands for so 'HP settings' makes no sense.\n- \"central idea behind Lewis definition\" who is Lewis here? What's the reference to?\n- \"causes, by themselves, increase the probability of their effects\" that is nonsensical; are you arguing that if a cause exists then the effect _may_ happen?\n- \"as the role of intervention is to mechanically separate the impact of a variable from the collective impact\" what does that mean?\n- Typo: 'stochiastic process'\n- What is a \"sticky value\"?\n\n### Formal establishment of causation\n\n- The grammar is getting noticeably worse as the paper is progressing. Consider proof-reading it a few times before next revision. \n- So far I do not following the reasoning in this section, specifically though why would this be true \"This could prove useful in the context of causal discovery.\"?\n- Typo: \"Equation equation 10 shows\"\n- \"Wrongly identifying correlations as causal links is a core problem in formal reasoning\" I would argue that it is a core problem in all of science. \n- I suggest you pick anything but 'g-formula' as 'g-formula' is already a popular approach for estimating treatment or exposure effects from longitudinal data that are subject to time-varying confounding. Which is not what you are doing here and so because that name is already reserved it may be wise to select something more distinctive.\n\n### Experiments\n\n- \"Modeling dynamical systems as SCMs is computationally and memory intensive to a prohibitive degree, especially in systems with numerous variables\" this is not true and plenty of work do precisely this, here is a good review paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06208.pdf\n- I do not understand what we are looking at in figure 1. There is almost no explanation for what the axis metrics are, what the frames are, why they are chosen and what they are meant to represent. What is blue? What is red? How are we meant to understand the horizontal row of subplots for $g$? How is any of this explainable? Certainly you say that we do not need system equations and graphs for this method, but I am struggling to understand how this is at all more useful?\n- Finally I do not agree with this statement at all \"Consequently, existing methods are irrelevant for baseline comparisons\" - if they are truly inadequate, as you claim, for dynamical settings then empirically show us why and show us how much better this theory is in comparison. Right now, unfortunately, we have to take you at face value that this statement is in fact true even though, in this review alone, multiple sources have been provided which point to the contrary. I do not think this is a fair evaluation of this work, let alone other models of causation.\n- The captions for all the figures in this section are much much too short to describe the amount of detail that is happening not just in the whole figure but all the panels included therein. Regrettably the main text does a fairly poor job of providing the missing explanation as we ll."

Here, we address all the points. \n\n> I think you are being a bit unfair to the research community with your first sentence \u2026\n\nWe covered the literature on both static and dynamic settings in the Related Work section (we will update that section in light of new pointers). What we meant by the opening sentence is that causation in dynamical settings are far less attended to in the existing literature. If this still sounds unfair, we will update it to clarify. \n\n> \"If cause event A had not occurred, effect event B would not have occurred\" this sentence does not make grammatical sense.\n\nThis sentence is both correct and accurate. Indeed, you can see this repeatedly in various philosophical texts when talking about counterfactual analysis. See for example Paul\u2019s classic paper, 1st page right under \u201cLewis\u2019s Analysis\u201d (that\u2019s why we have placed this statement inside quotation marks): \n\nL. A. Paul, \u2018Problems with Late Preemption\u2019, Analysis, vol. 58, no. 1, pp. 48\u201353, 1998.\n\nTo help rectifying your mind, we italicise *cause event A*.\n\nThe reviewer can further refer to this work to better understand this fundamental philosophy of causation: Menzies, Peter and Helen Beebee, \"Counterfactual Theories of Causation\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2020 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = <https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2020/entries/causation-counterfactual/> \n\n> what are these limitations? Pearl has multiple works \u2026\n\nWe would like to point out that the next few sentences of the paragraph highlight these with references. However, we will further discuss here some of the major differences along with the shortcomings of the interventionist/manipulationist framework: \n\n1. Difficulty/impossibility of interventions in many dynamical settings: Unlike the interventions/manipulations approach to understand causation, we can make our conclusions from raw observational data without having to conduct interventions or worry about the kind of interventions, especially in complex systems. Further, interventions might not be possible in all physical systems, as we\u2019ll discuss in detail in the answer to the next question. \n\n2. Need to know causal graphs (a strong assumption) and scaling poorly with the number of variables. We discuss this in detail w.r.t the Atari example, in the response to another question of the reviewer.\n\n3. Confusion about time of happening an event: our definition of an event clears all the confusion around the time of happening of an event and provides the flexibility to study multiple events that share the same ruling variables and admit the same changes but occur at different points in time.  \n\n4. Other interventions between events: Instead of considering actions under a fixed policy, i.e., restricting the chain of events between $A$ and $B$, we examine if event $A$ causes $B$ under the most pessimistic version of such chains of events. Remark that adhering to a certain chain of actions can also be readily considered in our framework. \n\n5. These approaches ignore the dynamics as well as the possibility of other interventions between events (as explained later). \n\nIn order to get specific differences between our framework and the Halpern and Pearl framework for causation [Joseph Y Halpern and Judea Pearl. Causes and explanations: A structural-model approach. part ii: Explanations] please refer to the last section of Appendix C.3."

In contrast to previous work on continuous-time causality which aims to compute the effect of certain prespecified interventions (in SCM-type settings), the paper seeks to answer questions of the type \"Given an event B, can we say whether another event A was a cause of B?\". A central idea is the one of grit: If A is the cause of B, the corresponding grit (minimum probability of occurrence of B under all possible policies) should increase. Based on this intuition, the paper provides a rigorous definition of the cause of a given event, as well as the computational tools to verify this. Finally, the benefits of the proposed framework are shown in two experiments."

To the best of my knowledge, the paper is the first to propose a framework for \"reverse causality\" in a dynamic setting.\n- The paper is well-written and the main ideas are easy to grasp, even though the topic is quite abstract/conceptual.

I am not an expert in this area, but I think there are some existing works on this that are not mentioned in the paper, e.g., Gelman and Imbens (2013). I do not think that these approaches build upon a dynamic setting, but I still think that the paper would benefit from a section that relates these approaches.\n- Definition of cause/grit. I am wondering whether an event $A$ could be a cause of an event $B$ even though the expected grit of $B$ does not increase from before to after $A$. Imagine a medical setting, where a doctor prescribes treatment (event $A$), that only works in combination with another treatment (event $C$) to cure the patient (event ($B$). ($A$ -> $C$ -> $B$). Then $C$ would be a cause but $A$ would not be a cause because the grit would not increase from before to after $A$ (since the grit is the minimum probability of $B$ over all possible policies, also the one that does not administer $C$). However, intuitively both $A$ and $C$ should be causes. \n- No code is provided (this is minor as the contributions of the paper are mostly theoretical)"

Please do let us know if the explanations are clear and whether you have more questions. \n\n> The general problem setup reminds me of what some in the field call \"reverse causality\". \n\nThanks for the pointer, we would add the citation. This seems to be a short paper that suggests forward and reverse questions. While not providing any actual formulation (and computational framework), the view is interesting and must be acknowledged. \n\n> Definition of cause/grit (medical event A -> C -> B).\n\nIn your example, if $C$ happens (or can happen) with some non-zero probability, even unknown or non-stationary, then $A$ is a cause of $B$ and is also correctly captured by our theory [the grit indeed increases by $A$ as shown below]. On the other hand, if $C$ is chosen not to happen at all, then $B$ will never happen. In this case, $A$ will not be considered a cause because we violate condition C1 (in our definition of causation), where $A$ must happen before $B$ - here $B$ never happens! We note that in the lack of event $B$, there is no causal question. Put it a bit differently, $A$ is a cause of $B$ conditioned on $C$ being selected with non-zero probability (and this is exactly what our framework deduces). That is, grit is meaningful only if $B$ is not unlikely to happen. \n\nAs a side note, we have also observed this computationally in the Diabetes example. W.r.t. insulin intakes, we observed that **any** insulin intake shows an increase in expected grit -- even when it is insufficient to cause event $B$ by itself and at least another sufficiently large intake is required. This is precisely what is expected from the theoretical analysis. \n\n**Analysis:** First, please recall that the definition of causation asserts the **expected** change of grit must be positive from before to after $A$. Let $C$ happen with probability $p > 0$ and if it happens, the grit of $B$ increases by $\\alpha > 0$ (since $A$ has already happened). Then $\\mathbb{E}\\Delta\\Gamma_{B}(A) = p\\times\\alpha + (1-p) \\times 0 > 0 $. Hence, grit of $B$ cannot be the same from before to after $A$, and indeed **it increases**. Thus, $A$ is also a cause unless either $p$ or $\\alpha$ is zero. \n\n> Why is the notion of grit the correct way \n\nAs we discussed above, the notion of grit works fully inline with what is expected intuitively as a causal relationship (even when it looks counterintuitive at the first glance). The minimum probability provides the natural way of dealing with possible future actions, as it ensures that $A$ is named a cause of $B$ only if it is so under any (even pessimistic) future trajectory. Importantly, if there is no action, then it automatically retrieves the standard definition (that $A$ should increase *probability* of $B$, rather than *grit* of $B$). Moreover, if a fixed policy is chosen to follow, either in general or only after event $A$, our framework still works readily, as $V^*$ will automatically be replaced by $V^{\\pi}$. \n\n> No code is provided \n\nWe will release the complete code that reproduces all the results presented in the paper (and can easily be modified for other use-cases).\n \n> The notation of state $X(t)$ \u2026\n\nThis is a common way, which basically only sets time as the base argument (mostly to parallel the discrete-time format). It\u2019s being used in literature, see for example RL/DP papers in continuous time, such as this one: \n\nKim and Yang, \u2018Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Equations for Q-Learning in Continuous Time\u2019, in Conference on Learning for Dynamics and Control, 2020, vol. 120, pp. 739\u2013748.\n\n> notation $V^{\\pi}$\n\nWe fixed it; thanks for the pointer. $\\pi$ needs to be in the condition of expectation."

Please do let us know if these discussions are clear and satisfactory and whether you have more questions.\n \n> The reviewer find the paper very hard to read and understand.\n \nWe would like to highlight that this is a deeply interdisciplinary subject by nature and a certain level of complexity is unavoidable. This paper covers materials at the intersection of different communities (causality, systems control, reinforcement learning, and even philosophy). We tried to keep the presentation more formal and less descriptive with the hope that it helps the reader to follow the ideas in a precise manner, regardless of differences in community-related aspects. We indeed wrote several drafts of this work, and based on various internal feedback; the current version seems to be the most reliable as read by people with different backgrounds.\n\nWe, however, will do modifications before final submission to improve the presentation as much as possible.\n \n \n> Some of the assumptions are already well known in causality (\u201cCausality necessitates time\u201d. \u201c Cause happens before effect\u201d).\n \nWe are respectfully not sure why this point is set as a weakness?\n \nIn any case, we would like to emphasize that these are NOT our assumptions, rather these are basic axioms which are well-known and are true in any causal arguments. We simply place them at the forefront. We will modify the text to clarify this point.\n \n> The reliance of the proposed method on optimal value function corresponding to reward function seems a strong one.\n \nIt is a fair point but it is also the case for **any** method that uses neural nets or approximation techniques (and we add a statement to reflect on this in the paper). Nonetheless, what is important here is that, using optimal value functions, our framework provides a strong basis (with formal grounds) to design a learning problem and gives all the computational tools to establish causal links in dynamical systems -- something which did not exist before, at least not at this level of formal rigour and explicitness, while still practically applicable and useful. Then, in practice, the optimal values will be replaced with the *learned* ones from data. As with ANY learning problem, the results will be reliable to the extent of approximation errors; this is not a specific problem of our framework, rather is a generic issue.\n \nOf note, additional theoretical arguments can also be made here. For example, if the approximated value function is off by some maximum amount, then under certain assumptions, the degrade in validity of causal arguments will also be bounded (proof sketch: the bound over values will map to the same bound over grit, which will then be used in the decomposition lemma to bound the error in each component). Or, if the value of a certain policy is used in place of $V^{*}$, the causal arguments will be completely valid if that policy is followed after event $A$ (this result is immediate from the definition of value functions).\n \nWe would like to remark that presenting such results can go much beyond the scope of a single conference-paper.\n \n> will be interesting to investigate how the proposed method works as the function of number of variables.\n \nOur framework scales well to even huge state-spaces simply because it maps the problem into RL settings (and current deep RL methods can easily handle extremely large state-spaces). Even in the provided Atari problem, the state comprises 28224 variables (corresponding to the pixels of four consecutive game screens)! The T1 diabetes simulator, on the other hand, deals with 13 state variables and 2 action variables. This reflects the range of variables our proposed method can handle. \n\nIn a related context, as the base problem here is an RL problem (due to our Value Lemma), any value-based RL technique can be used, and the scalability will be inherited from the properties of the RL algorithm."

They extend Lewis [1979, 2000] notion of a cause as an event that precedes the effect event and increases the effect's probability relative to a counterfactual world where the cause did not occur. The extension to MDPs takes the min over all actions that lead to the event. Given this notion of causality, they show that the key quantities, grit (the minimum probability that an event occurs from a given state), and reachability (the analogous maximum probability), can be computed by solving an appropriately designed reinforcement learning problem. This makes the framework generically applicable which they demonstrate with experiments from Atari's Pong (with pixel-level observations), and a diabetes simulation."

And perhaps most importantly, it would help explain the need to map the estimation of grit and reachability as an RL problem. If it was up to me, I this paper in the reverse order of how it is currently written: first set up a problem from the experiments, then explain the key queries that you would like to answer from section 4, and then introduce how they can be answered by formulating this as an RL problem (section 3).\n\nMDP:\n - when the MDP is introduced, it is not clear how it relates to the system of interest - was only later that I realized that the MDP is used for estimation of grit and reachability, and not part of the definition of causality. \n\nMinor:\n - top of page 3: \"straight\" -> \"straightforward\"\n - \"In the HP settings of causation\" - what is HP here?"

However, the page limit does not allow for such a presentation, unless a significant portion is omitted. As this paper covers materials at the intersection of different core topics (causality, systems control, reinforcement learning, and even philosophy), we believe it would be required to cover them all and there is little room to shorten the paper. We tried to keep the presentation more formal and less descriptive/intuitive with the hope that it helps the reader to follow the ideas in a precise manner, rather than motivating at the forefront. We indeed wrote several drafts of this work, and based on various internal feedback; the current version seems to be the most reliable as read by people with different backgrounds. We, however, will do modifications before final submission to improve the presentation as much as possible. \n\n> what is HP\n\nIt stands for Halpern and Pearl. The explanatory sentence should unfortunately have been deleted in one of the last revisions. Will fix it.\n\n> MDP\n\nWe will add a clarification why MDP is defined (when it is introduced) to help address your point. \n\n> Does this framework need the ability to take actions (i.e. do we need an MDP), or is that just an estimation technique?\n\nOur framework does not *need* the ability to take actions, and you certainly can use this theory for a system with only states (no action).\n\nThe reason to use MDP is basically the other way round: a system/environment may *include* actions and the framework needs to be able to cover such cases as well; hence, MDP is needed in general. Moreover, as we discussed in the paper, an event may also be defined as taking an action (a change in an action variable) rather than a change in a state variable. Our theory covers such cases too, which is again why we need MDP in general.\n\n > I just observe a dynamical system but don't have the ability to take actions, I can't infer causality in this framework, right?\n \nYou definitely can. This case can happen if either there is no action in the system by nature, or a fixed policy is taking care of actions with no freedom (hence, there is effectively no action). In all state-only problems, you simply use $\\Gamma_{B}(X)$ and $V_{\\Gamma}(X)$ and the rest of the theory remains valid and intact."
