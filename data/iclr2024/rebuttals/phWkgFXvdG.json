It is a simple alternative to knowledge distillation and loss balance is also not new in the context of continual learning. \n(3) In the experimental section, I notice that YOLOX is used for the proposed method, but it is not the same as other competing methods, is it fair to compare in this way? \n(4) In the introduction section, it would be good to add some references when talking about the relevant methods."

The authors propose a novel approach to tackle this problem by focusing on effective Knowledge Selection Strategy (KSS) and Knowledge Transfer Strategy (KTS).  The paper introduces an image-level hybrid knowledge representation method, HKR, which combines instance-level soft knowledge (logits) and hard knowledge (one-hot predictions) to strike a balance between knowledge reliability and ambiguity. A task regularized distillation method, TRD, is presented as an effective knowledge transfer strategy. Extensive experiments on various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, the approach significantly reduces the mAP gap between incremental learning and joint learning, particularly in challenging scenarios."

In this sense, it may not be perceived as a highly novel contribution.\n3.

There is a disconnect between the paper's focus and the proposed solutions."

For example, equations 4 and 5 are almost identical. Why not merge them?"

Is it unfair to compare results on different detectors? The method designed in this paper to alleviate catastrophic forgetting is not specifically designed for YOLOX. Why is YOLOX chosen as the basic framework? In order to make a fair comparison, it is recommended to show the results on the same detector, such as reimplementing other methods on YOLOX.\n3. The description of Figure 1 is unclear, for example, whether w.o. and w/o are the same. There is no description of feature distillation in the article, but there are arrows in Figure 1, which brings a lot of confusion. And there is no description of NMS.\n4. Eq. 7 and 8 are the same, without the effect of balancing the learning process of new and old tasks as claimed in the paper. The last term in Eq. 10 is a regular L2 loss. So the implementation of \u201d task regularized\u201d distillation may require further explanation. In addition, can the author ablate the benefits brought by Loss_diff?"
