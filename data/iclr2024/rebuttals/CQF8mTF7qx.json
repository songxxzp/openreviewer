They investigate theoretically this gradient flow further for two-layer networks in which the second layer is fixed, and the derivative of the activation function is strictly positive and strictly convex; and for data points which are linearly independent and hence of cardinality not greater than their dimension.  There are two main results: first, that the first-order and global optima of the trace of the Hessian of the loss on the zero-loss manifold coincide, and are such that the projection of every first-layer weight vector in every such optimum onto the subspace spanned by the data points is a unique vector determined by the data, the network width, and the invertible activation function; and second, that gradient flow on the zero-loss manifold converges to such an optimum exponentially fast.  The theoretical results are supplemented by numerical experiments that explore weakening the assumption of data to allow cardinality greater than the dimension."

If that is the case, then this orthogonal subspace basically plays no role in the paper, so why not simply assume that $n = d$?  That would also make the optima in parameter space (in Theorem 2) unique?\n\nWhat would constitute interesting future work?

                        "value": "**The proof of section 4.3 is not well-written.** \n\nThank you for the feedback, indeed we shifted the proof overview of the second part of Theorem 3 after the overview of the first part. \n\n**$g$ and $\\gamma$ are not defined.** \n\nThank you for spotting this, the single line that includes the notation $g,\\gamma$ is indeed a typo based on our previous notation. We have corrected this in the new version. \n\n**Typos/No code provided.** \n\nWe apologize for the typos, we have fixed them in the new version. We have also submitted our code.\n\n\n**Q1: Where are the assumptions on the activations used?** \n\nThe first assumption is crucial in obtaining a closed-form for the stationary point of the trace of Hessian, hence it is used in the proof of Theorem 2. The second assumption (Assumption 3) arises naturally in showing the local g-convexity property of trace of Hessian at approximate stationary points, which we crucially use to obtain our convergence rate.\n\n**Q2: Why not consider $d=n$?** \n\nThe point mentioned by the reviewer is indeed correct, the subspace orthogonal to the data points plays no role and does not change during the optimization, hence the proof is similar to the case $d=n$. We preferred to present our result in this slightly more general setting because in applications of neural networks with high-dimensional data, it is often the case that $d > n$. Note that the subspace of the data span, even though it has a lower dimension than the ambient space, is still informative about the ultimate function that we are trying to learn.\n\n\n**Q3: No future directions provided.**\n\nThank you for your feedback, we added two ideas in the conclusion section about future directions that we think are interesting regarding our work. \n\n**Q4: How is this work related to \"Sharpness-Aware Minimization Leads to Low-Rank Features\"**\n\nIn the paper by writing down the update rule of SAM for a relu network, the authors unravel the local tendency of SAM to make the features sparser at each step. They further confirm this hypothesis empirically for deep relu networks and see that this sparsity also leads to low-rank features. In comparison, our work rigorously proves the low-rank property of the learned features by label noise SGD for a class of two-layer networks. Notably, our result can be generalized to 1-SAM as well by applying the results in Wen et al., 2023.\n\nGiven our changes and replies, we kindly ask the reviewer to increase her score."

Prior works have shown that label noise SGD and 1-SAM have an implicit bias towards flat minimizers (where flatness is quantified using trace of Hessian), but have not engaged with the question of what small Hessian trace implies about the network itself.  This paper has basically two main contributions.   First, they prove that for two-layer networks in a high-dimensional setting, under a certain assumption on the activation function, all of the flattest global minimizers admit a rank-1 feature matrix on the training dataset.  That is, all of the neurons are effectively identical as far as the training set is concerned.  This is a strong form of simplicity.  Second, they characterize the rate of convergence of label noise SGD to this set of flattest global minimizers."

The paper assumes that the data dimension is larger than the number of data points, which means that a linear regressor could fit the dataset perfectly.  This is an unrealistic assumption and it presumably makes a lot of the theory easier (e.g. I assume this assumption is what enables the authors to prove the global convergence of label noise SGD for narrow nets on arbitrary data from arbitrary initializations; barring this assumption on the data dimension, global convergence is ordinarily not provable even for vanilla gradient descent, let alone label noise SGD, right?).  On the positive side, the authors show _empirically_ that a version of the simplicity bias does seem to exist even for the practical low-dimensional setting.  I think it would be very interesting to characterize this simplicity bias in more detail, even if it cannot be accompanied by a global convergence proof.\n\n2.  The paper assumes that the third derivative of the activation function is strictly positive, which I believe rules out most real activation functions.  It would be interesting if the authors could discuss what kind of results could be established even in the absence of this strong assumption on the activation function.  From skimming the proofs, it seems that this assumption is needed in order to invert the second derivative of the activation function, but could we say anything interesting about an activation like tanh where the second derivative is not completely invertible but is invertible up to sign?"

                    "value": "- As discussed above, how far could you get without making the assumptions about (1) high data dimension and (2) third derivative positivity?  Let's say we didn't care about proving global convergence, or global convergence rate, and just cared about understanding the structure of the flattest global minimizers.\n\n- The conclusion says: \"we show that by initializing the neurons in the subspace of high-dimensional input data, all of the neurons converge into a single vector.\"  But, I can't find any part of the text that discusses either this special initialization, or the result that the neurons converge to a single vector.  By contrast, the main text proves that for _any_ initialization, all the neurons _agree entirely on the training dataset_, which is weaker than saying that all neurons are identical.  I think I do understand why the sentence in the conclusion follows from this: if the neurons are initialized within the span of the input data, then since they always move within the span of the input data, they must end up within the span of the input data; and there is only one possible set of weights that both lies within the span of the input data and matches the necessary targets, and this is a pseudoinverse.  But the paper did not discuss this explicitly.\n\n  - If you added weight decay, would it be true that for any initialization, all the neurons converge to a single vector?"

                    "value": "The results and the way the paper is articulated lacks clearness and some parts are largely overclaimed. Here is a list of potential improvement regarding these:\n\n- First, *it has to be clear that the authors consider* the Li et al. asymptotic flow for granted. They study it in a particular setting of the neural network with frozen outer layer and specific activation. Let me reming the authors that the result of Li et al is only asymptotic and the regime of label noise + step size + time scale that is described in this is not general at all. In other words, they should clarify this explicitly when stating their result (eg theorem 1).\n\n- Second, the authors claim that *for the ease of the exposition*, they set the second layer to one. If there is not clear proof of the fact that the result can be adapted from this, I do not believe it it an easy step to adapt their result to such a setup. Even though I do not expect things to change qualitatively.\n\n- Third, the Assumptions 1 and 3 on the activation function seems very restrtictive: relu, sigmoid or tanh, which are the popular ones do not seem to be covered.   \n\n- Finally, even though the Theorem 1 is informative, there is a need for more precision at this stage. To be concrete, there is  no clear definition of label noise SGD, no quantitative dependency on the step size and the noise of SGD\u2026 and for a fact: Li et al. result is asymptotic and non quantitative in essence.  Any quantitative and non-asymptotic result on this program is significantly difficult to obtain, see e.g.  **Label noise (stochastic) gradient descent implicitly solves the Lasso for quadratic parametrisation**, L. Pillaud-Vivien, et al. COLT 2022 on a specific prediction function.\n\nOn the simplicity bias and the label noise structure the authors might want to look at the following paper: **Sgd with large step sizes learns sparse features**.

Following the reviewer's suggestion, we also stressed in the main text before Theorem 1, that our theorem \" holds for sufficiently small learning rate.\"\n\n**Q2: The proof of the generalization to unequal second-layer weights is not clear.** \n\nOur analysis indeed extends to the case when the second layer weights are not all equal, as discussed in the proof of Theorem 2 (page 7 the paragraph \"This characterizes...\".) In such case, our simplicity bias will be slightly different, in the sense that the $\\phi''$ image of the feature matrix becomes rank one instead. \n\nWe apologize for the confusion. In the revision, we have removed the phrases \"for simplicity of presentation\" and \nhave moved the discussion about the case with general weights right after the proof of Theorem 2 at the bottom of page 7.\n\n**Q4: More details for Theorem 1.** \n\nWe explicitly noted in Theorem 1 that the result holds for any level of noise in label noise SGD. We further reminded the definition of label noise SGD to the reader right before stating Theorem 1.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the valuable references provided; indeed obtaining non-asymptotic results for label noise SGD is more demanding and we see it as an important future direction, even for more general networks. We have added the provided references to the paper.\n\n**Q5: Typos.**\n\nThank you for spotting the typos. We just want to point out that regarding your comment about page 3 typos there is probably a misunderstanding, the line \u201cthe first phase where the algorithm is far from stationary points trace of Hessian\u2026\u201d should be read as \u201cthe first phase where the algorithm is far from stationary points, trace of Hessian decreases slowly and...\u201d. We have added the comma after \u201cpoints\u201d to make that clear.\n\nGiven the changes we have made, we kindly ask the reviewer to increase her score."

This simplification unavoidably loses some important nature in neural network training.\n\n2.  The assumption of a larger input dimension than the number of samples deviates a lot from practical settings. In particular, such an assumption (together with the choice of activation) ensures the realizability of the model (i.e., zero minimal loss) regardless of the network width. However, in most practical settings, the input dimension is much smaller than the number of data samples, and the realizability is usually achieved by sufficient network width."
