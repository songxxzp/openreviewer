                    "value": "This work introduces a technique to self-train LLMs by leveraging their capabilities to (1) solve problems using multiple methods (code and text) and (2) translate solutions between methods. This multi-method self-training (MMST) solution is shown to improve human-rated performance for the BLOOM language model on both arithmetic tasks on which the method can be used to self-train, and on other tasks which benefit from the self-finetuned model's improved reasoning capabilities. In addition, the paper formulates 2 hypotheses on why this method works and finds that (1) MMST's improved performance is not solely linked to additional training examples, and (2) MMST benefits from leveraging methods that are anti-correlated."

One drawback of the current presentation of results is that they do not give a clear sense of how they compare to other self-improvement techniques that have published promising results on arithmetic tasks.\n\n* Originality: while a number of recent works have proposed techniques for models to self-improve, the proposed multi-domain technique and its leverage of translation capabilities across methods are a novel and relevant way to leverage the diversity of tasks LLMs can handle.\n\n* Significance: while the results look promising, their significance is hard to grasp without a clear head-to-head comparison with preexisting methods."

The paper focuses on arithmetic reasoning tasks with two methods: solving via chain of thought prompting and solving via writing code. Through extensive experiments, the authors demonstrate that multi-method self-training improves the trained model for math solving in both chain-of-thought and coding. Besides, the authors conduct ablation studies for two hypotheses: MMST works because of data quantity, and MMST works because of anti-correlation between methods. Moreover, they also observe improvements on out-of-domain tasks, generating solutions to strategy and commonsense questions."
