Especially, image resampling via bilinear or nearest interpolation might be not effective enough to eliminate adversarial perturbation.**\n\nThank you for the comments. We propose to leverage image resampling to enhance the adversarial robustness of DNNs against adversarial perturbations. To achieve this goal, we need to address two key questions: 1. how to construct the clean continuous scene based on the input adversarial example? 2. how to estimate the pixel shifting that can further eliminate the influence of adversarial perturbation effectively? **Our method can enhance adversarial robustness significanly since we properly address the two key questions:** First, we build the implicit continuous representation for the first question, which enables us to eliminate the adversarial perturbation while preserving or reconstructing clean details. The reconstruction methods based on bilinear and near interpolations do not have such a capability, thus is not effective to eliminate the adversarial perturbations. Second, we introduce SampleNet, which automatically generates pixel-wise shifts for resampling in response to different inputs, making the reconstructed image have similar semantic features with ground truth category.\n\nTo better understand our method, we clarify the effectiveness from two perspectives:\n\n### A. The effectiveness of implicit representation reconstruction\n\nIn this part, we employ four metrics to assess the reconstruction of the implicit representation: PSNR [1], SSIM [2], loss of low frequency and high frequency FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) [3], and LPIPS [4].\n\n1. PSNR: As shown in Table 4.1a, the PSNR value is higher for implicit representation reconstructed images (36.01) compared to adversarial images (32.1). This indicates that the reconstructed adversarial images have higher fidelity and less distortion compared to the clean images after reconstruction.\n2. SSIM: The SSIM value is higher for reconstructed adversarial images (0.9973) compared to adversarial images (0.9936). This suggests that the reconstructed adversarial images better preserve the structural details of the original images.\n3. FFT: Both FFT Low Loss and FFT High Loss are lower for reconstructed adversarial images compared to clean images. This implies that less information is lost in frequency domains during the reconstruction of adversarial images.\n4. LPIPS: The LPIPS value is significantly lower for reconstructed adversarial images (0.0169) compared to adversarial images (0.0771). This suggests that the reconstructed adversarial images are more perceptually similar to the original images compared to the adversarial images.\n\nOverall, the table suggests that the reconstructed versions of adversarial images tend to exhibit better quality and closer resemblance to the original images across multiple metrics. This also implies that the implicit representation does not sacrifice meaningful information in the raw image when eliminating adversarial perturbations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using implicit continuous representation to represent images within a continuous coordinate space.\nIn Bilinear and Nearest RECONS methods, they rely on the original pixel point as their starting point for representation, meaning they can still be affected by the adversarial patterns present in the adversarial images.\n\nTable 4.1a: Image quality results on CIFAR 10.\n\n|                        | Clean Images and Adversarial Images | Clean Images and Reconstructed Adversarial Images |\n| ---------------------- | :-----------------------------------:| :-------------------------------------------------: |\n| PSNR                   | 32.10                                | 36.01                                             |\n| SSIM                   | 0.9936                              | 0.9973                                            |\n| Low Frequency FFT Loss | 0.0626                              | 0.0506                                            |\n| High Frequency FFT Loss | 0.3636                              | 0.2489                                            |\n| LPIPS                  | 0.0771                              | 0.0169                                            |\n\n[1] Hore, Alain, and Djemel Ziou. \"Image quality metrics: PSNR vs. SSIM.\" 2010 20th international conference on pattern recognition.

Especially, image resampling via bilinear or nearest interpolation might be not effective enough to eliminate adversarial perturbation.**\n\n### B. The effectiveness of SampleNet\n\nWe introduce two additional perspectives to analyze our method and observe the following: First, SampleNet significantly diminishes semantic disparity, bringing reconstructed adversarial and clean representations into closer alignment. Second, SampleNet aligns the decision paths of reconstructed adversarial examples with those of clean examples.\n\nFirstly, we delve into analyzing the features to comprehend how the semantics of the images evolve and perform PCA to visualize the analysis. We randomly selected 100 images from one class and obtained the features of clean images (Clean), adversarial images (Adv), adversarial images after implicit reconstruction (RECONS(Adv)), and adversarial images after IRAD (IRAD(Adv)). We computed the mean in each dimension of the features of clean images to establish the central point of these clean features. Subsequently, we computed the Euclidean distance between the features of other images and the center of clean images. As shown in Table 4.1b, the average Euclidean distance of adversarial image features is significantly distant from clean image features. After the reconstruction of implicit representation, the adversarial image features become closer to the center of clean images' features. Following IRAD, the distance becomes even closer.\nThe PCA findings also illustrate a comparable phenomenon. As depicted in Figure 5 (Appendix A.8), clean adversarial images are notably distant from clean images. Following the reconstruction of implicit representation, there are fewer samples situated far from clean images. Moreover, significantly fewer images lie outside the clean distribution after employing IRAD.\nTherefore, this demonstrates that the shift map generated by SampleNet can notably reduce semantic disparity and bring adversarial and clean representations into closer alignment.\n\nTable 4.1b: The comparison of feature distances.\n\n| Comparison            | Euclidean Distance |\n| --------------------- | :------------------: |\n| Clean and Adv         | 2.91               |\n| Clean and RECONS(Adv) | 1.21               |\n| Clean and IRAD(Adv)   | 0.75               |\n\n\n\nSecondly, we follow the methodology of previous research to conduct decision rationale analysis through decision path analysis [5][6][7][8], aiming to understand the decision-making process following resampling. These studies highlight \"decision paths\" in neural networks, formed by critical nodes like highly contributive neurons at each layer. These paths reflect the network's semantic information flow for specific data sets. When decision paths of two data groups are similar, it indicates closely aligned decision rationales and semantics, revealing how the network interprets and identifies different data. Thus, we obtain the decision paths of Adv, RECONS(Adv), and IRAD(Adv), and calculate their cosine similarity with the decision path of clean images. As shown in Table 4.1c, after the reconstruction of implicit representation, the decision path becomes more similar. By using IRAD, the similarity (i.e. 0.9987) becomes even higher. These results demonstrate that after resampling, our method exhibits a closer alignment with the decision rationales and semantics observed in clean images.\n\nTable 4.1c: Decision path comparison.\n\n| Comparison            | Similarity |\n| --------------------- | :----------: |\n| Clean and Adv         | 0.5482     |\n| Clean and RECONS(Adv) | 0.9915     |\n| Clean and IRAD(Adv)   | 0.9987     |\n\nThese two experiments further highlight the effectiveness of our resampling technique in disrupting adversarial textures and mitigating adversarial attacks.\n\nWe have added the experimental results and analysis into our Appendix A.7 and Appendix A.8.\n\n[5] Khakzar, Ashkan, et al. \"Neural response interpretation through the lens of critical pathways.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2021.\n\n[6] Li, Tianlin, et al. \"Understanding adversarial robustness via critical attacking route.\" Information Sciences 547 (2021): 568-578.\n\n[7] Wang, Yulong, et al. \"Interpret neural networks by identifying critical data routing paths.\" proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2018.\n\n[8] Qiu, Yuxian, et al. \"Adversarial defense through network profiling based path extraction.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019."

As a result, in Table 5, IRAD cannot exhibit robustness when SampleNet is attacked simultaneously.**\n\nThank you for the comments. SampleNet could also be attacked when attackers have full knowledge of defense methods and models. We have discussed this in the original submission in Sec.6.1 with Table 5. Specifically, our initially designed IRAD exhibits vulnerability to white-box attacks while Diffpure exhibits strong robustness under such settings. However, DiffPure\u2019s high performance comes at the expense of significant computational resources. Therefore, we suggest a hybrid approach that capitalizes on the strengths of both DiffPure and IRAD. When we combined IRAD with DiffPure (See Sec. 5), our IRAD+DiffPure (t=20) method achieved comparable SA and RA with DiffPure, and it\u2019s about five times faster.\nWe also conduct experiments to explore the integration of IRAD with various steps of DiffPure in Table 4.2. The results show that the hybrid surpasses DiffPure (t=100) in terms of SA, RA, Avg., and time efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements.\n\nTable 4.2: Comparing different steps in the integration of IRAD and DiffPure.\n\n|                      | SA    | RA    | Avg.  | Cost (ms) |\n| -------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---------: |\n| DiffPure (t=100)            | 89.73 | 75.12 | 82.42 | 132.80     |\n| DISCO                | 89.25 | 0     | 44.63 | 0.38      |\n| IRAD                 | 91.70 | 0     | 45.85 | 0.68      |\n| DiffPure (t=20)      | 93.66 | 8.01  | 50.83 | 27.25     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=20) | 93.42 | 74.05 | 83.73 | 27.70     |\n| DiffPure (t=25)      | 93.55 | 18.28 | 55.92 | 31.93     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=25) | 91.42 | 77.71 | 84.57 | 32.41     |\n| DiffPure (t=30)      | 92.85 | 36.28 | 64.57 | 37.62     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=30) | 92.33 | 82.85 | 87.59 | 38.37     |\n| DiffPure (t=35)      | 93.50  | 48.75 | 71.13 | 44.18     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=35) | 89.14 | 84.57 | 86.86 | 44.86     |\n| DiffPure (t=40)      | 93.71 | 59.42 | 76.57 | 51.78     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=40) | 90.57 | 86.00    | 88.29 | 52.33     |\n\n**W3. In my opinion, such a resampling method cannot effectively defend against white-box attacks.

We have followed your advice and conducted experiments on the two most recent works [1][2], which include three attack methods (i.e., VmiFgsm, VniFgsm, and Admix). Our results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms DISCO when facing all three attacks. In comparison to DiffPure, IRAD exhibits notably superior SA and RA when subjected to the VmiFgsm and VniFgsm attacks. While DiffPure slightly surpasses IRAD in RA under the Admix attack, it is worth mentioning that the inference process of DiffPure is approximately 200 times slower than IRAD as shown in Table 5 in our manuscript.\n\nWe have added the experiments into our manuscripts (Appendix A.4) and the other attack the reviewer mentioned into the related work.\n\nTable 4.3a: WRN28-10 against VmiFgsm attack on CIFAR10.\n\n| Defense          | SA    | RA    | Avg.  |\n| ---------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |\n| No Defense       | 94.77 | 0     | 47.39 |\n| DISCO            | 89.24 | 50.51 | 69.88 |\n| DiffPure (t=100) | 89.21 | 85.55 | 87.38 |\n| IRAD             | 91.70  | 86.22 | 88.96 |\n\n\n\nTable 4.3b: WRN28-10 against VniFgsm attack on CIFAR10.\n\n| Defense          | SA    | RA    | Avg.  |\n| ---------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |\n| No Defense       | 94.77 | 0     | 47.39 |\n| DISCO            | 89.24 | 52.76 | 71.00    |\n| DiffPure (t=100) | 89.21 | 85.49 | 87.35 |\n| IRAD             | 91.70  | 87.65 | 89.68 |\n\nTable 4.3c: WRN28-10 against Admix attack on CIFAR10.\n\n| Defense          | SA    | RA    | Avg.  |\n| ---------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |\n| No Defense       | 94.77 | 3.82  | 49.30  |\n| DISCO            | 89.24 | 65.91 | 77.58 |\n| DiffPure (t=100) | 89.21 | 85.23 | 87.22 |\n| IRAD             | 91.70  | 82.39 | 87.05 |\n\n\n[1] Wang, Xiaosen, and Kun He. \"Enhancing the transferability of adversarial attacks through variance tuning.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2021.\n\n[2] Wang, Xiaosen, et al. \"Admix: Enhancing the transferability of adversarial attacks.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021."

We conduct evaluation on NRP [1] under the AutoAttack and BPDA attack. Compared with other defense methods, NRP is a purifier network that tries to minimize the perceptual feature difference between clean and Self Supervised Perturbations (SSP) generated adversary. As shown in their work, they use NRP trained on MS-COCO dataset to successfully defend ImageNet models.\n\nTable 4.4: Results of NRP under AutoAttack and BPDA.\n\n| Dataset  | Attack     | SA    | RA   | Avg.  |\n| -------- | ---------- | :-----: | :----: | :-----: |\n| cifar10  | AutoAttack | 92.89 | 3.82 | 46.58 |\n|          | BPDA       | 92.89 | 0.27 | 48.36 |\n| cifar100 | AutoAttack | 77.05 | 6.82 | 41.94 |\n|          | BPDA       | 77.05 | 0.59 | 38.82 |\n| Imagenet | AutoAttack | 72.52 | 20.40 | 46.46 |\n|          | BPDA       | 72.52 | 0.02 | 36.27 |\n\nOur analysis reveals that, in comparison with our method and other baseline approaches, the NRP demonstrates lower effectiveness, particularly in terms of its Robust Accuracy (RA) performance.

Central to their proposal is the \"Implicit Representation Driven Image Resampling (IRAD)\" methodology, which operates in two distinct phases: a) the creation of a continuous coordinate space, and b) the utilization of the newly proposed SampleNet. Unlike conventional heuristic sampling strategies, SampleNet is designed to predict pixel-wise shifts based on the embedding of the input image automatically. Moreover, in a pursuit of optimal performance and a marked increase in processing speed, the authors have integrated their method with DiffPure."

The updated results, along with the previous findings, are presented in Table 3.1. Due to the significant time and resource costs associated with implementing DiffPure, we perform the experiment on 300 randomly selected images from the test set. The findings indicate that IRAD consistently enhances DiffPure's performance across various steps. For example, with t=40, the combination of IRAD and DiffPure (t=40) notably increases the Robust Accuracy (RA) of DiffPure (t=40) from 59.42 to 86.00. Moreover, it surpasses DiffPure (t=100) in terms of SA, RA, Avg., and time efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements.\n\nWe have added the experimental results to Appendix A.5.\n\nTable 3.1 Comparing different steps in the integration of IRAD and DiffPure.\n\n|                      | SA    | RA    | Avg.  | Cost (ms) |\n| -------------------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :---------: |\n| DiffPure             | 89.73 | 75.12 | 82.42 | 132.80     |\n| DISCO                | 89.25 | 0     | 44.63 | 0.38      |\n| IRAD                 | 91.70 | 0     | 45.85 | 0.68      |\n| DiffPure (t=20)      | 93.66 | 8.01  | 50.83 | 27.25     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=20) | 93.42 | 74.05 | 83.73 | 27.70     |\n| DiffPure (t=25)      | 93.55 | 18.28 | 55.92 | 31.93     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=25) | 91.42 | 77.71 | 84.57 | 32.41     |\n| DiffPure (t=30)      | 92.85 | 36.28 | 64.57 | 37.62     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=30) | 92.33 | 82.85 | 87.59 | 38.37     |\n| DiffPure (t=35)      | 93.50  | 48.75 | 71.13 | 44.18     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=35) | 89.14 | 84.57 | 86.86 | 44.86     |\n| DiffPure (t=40)      | 93.71 | 59.42 | 76.57 | 51.78     |\n| IRAD+DiffPure (t=40) | 90.57 | 86.00    | 88.29 | 52.33     |"

                        "value": "## W1. Why the proposed method works?\n\n**I am having difficulty being convinced of why this approach works. The paper's objective is to construct an implicit representation for the input image and then reconstruct the clean image from this implicit representation, claiming that the reconstructed image would be free from any adversarial patterns. However, if we assume that the underlying implicit representation faithfully represents the input signal, it should also contain the adversarial patterns that present in the input signal. This contradicts the explanation for why the proposed method is effective.**\n\nThank you for the valuable comments. The reviewer might have misunderstood the idea and certain details of this work. To clarify, we will address the question from two aspects: the main idea and why the proposed method works.\n\n**The main idea:** We propose to leverage image resampling to enhance the adversarial robustness of DNNs against adversarial perturbations. To achieve this goal, we need to address two key questions: 1. how to construct the clean continuous scene based on the input adversarial example? 2. how to estimate the pixel shifting that can further eliminate the influence of adversarial perturbation effectively? *Our method achieves the objective of enhancing adversarial robustness since we properly address the two key questions.*\n\n**Why proposed method works:**\n\n1. \nWe address the first question properly by training a local implicit representation (i.e., Eq. (9) in Sec. 4.2) that can estimate the clean color of arbitrary given coordinates of a pixel. *Note that the implicit representation is not designed to faithfully represent the input signal but to eliminate adversarial perturbations and reconstruct the clean details.*\nTo achieve this, when given the coordinates of a pixel, we utilize an MLP to deduce the pixel's true color by considering the deep features of its neighboring pixels and their spatial distances. We train the MLP and the feature extraction model through the adversarial denoising task (refer to the discussion in Sec. 6.3 with Table 7).\nDuring the inference phase, the well-trained MLP can eliminate the adversarial noise while preserving the clean details. As illustrated in the visualization results (i.e., Figure 6-8) in the appendix, most of the adversarial perturbations are removed (for further explanations, please refer to the explanation section). \n\nTo further validate this, we add an image quality experiment. Specifically, we calculate the PSNR [1] and SSIM [2] between the clean image and adversarial image, the clean image and reconstructed adversarial image on CIFAR10 dataset, respectively. As shown in Table 2.1, the adversarial perturbations are significantly eliminated:\n(a) As shown in Table 2.1, after implicit representation reconstruction, the PSNR value increases from 32.1 to 36.01. This indicates that the reconstructed adversarial images have higher fidelity and less distortion compared to the clean images after reconstruction.\n(b) We have similar observations on the SSIM scores. This suggests that the reconstructed adversarial images better preserve the structural details of the original images.\n\n\nTable 2.1: Image quality results on CIFAR 10.\n\n|                        | Clean Images and Adversarial Images | Clean Images and Reconstructed Adversarial Images |\n| ---------------------- | :-----------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |\n| PSNR                   | 32.10                                | 36.01                                             |\n| SSIM                   | 0.9936                              | 0.9973     \n| LPIPS                  | 0.0771                              | 0.0169                                                         |\n| Low Frequency FFT Loss | 0.0626                              | 0.0506                                            |\n| High Frequency FFT Loss | 0.3636                              | 0.2489                                            |\n\n\n2. We address the second question properly by training a SampleNet that can predict the shifting that further breaks the influence of adversarial patterns and pushes the semantic features of the input image towards the category center.

However, this would imply a degradation in the image quality represented in the implicit model, as it suggests that the model cannot faithfully represent high-frequency signals. In either case, this highlights certain weaknesses in the proposed method**\n\nThank you for contributing a new perspective to understand our method. As previously discussed, one main reason for the effectiveness is that the implicit representation could effectively eliminate the adversarial perturbation while reconstructing clean details very well. While comprehending this process through the adjustment of low-frequency components and the elimination of high-frequency signals may not suffice to elucidate all the outcomes, we endeavor to provide an explanation, as it remains a constructive approach to enhance the clarity of the paper. In the frequency domain, our method is not to remove all high-frequency signals uniformly but to eliminate the high-frequency signals caused by adversarial perturbations and preserve the ones of clean/raw information.\n\nFor additional clarification, we extend the experiment in W1 to the frequency domain and employ two metrics to assess the reconstruction of the implicit representation: loss of low frequency and high frequency FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) [3], and LPIPS [4].\n\n1. FFT: Both FFT Low Loss and FFT High Loss are lower for reconstructed adversarial images compared to clean images. This implies that less information is lost in frequency domains during the reconstruction of adversarial images.\n\n2. LPIPS: The LPIPS value is significantly lower for reconstructed adversarial images (0.0169) compared to adversarial images (0.0771). This suggests that the reconstructed adversarial images are more perceptually similar to the original images compared to the adversarial images.\n\n\nOverall, Table 2.1 suggests that the reconstructed versions of adversarial images tend to exhibit better quality and closer resemblance to the original images across multiple metrics. This implies that the implicit representation does not sacrifice useful high-frequency information when eliminating adversarial perturbations. This demonstrates the effectiveness of using implicit continuous representation to represent images within a continuous coordinate space.\n\nWe have added the experimental results and analysis to Appendix A.7.\n\n[1] Hore, Alain, and Djemel Ziou. \"Image quality metrics: PSNR vs. SSIM.\" 2010 20th international conference on pattern recognition.

How about the performance of bilinear interpolation with SampletNet?**\n\nThank you for the helpful advice.\n\nWe conducted an ablation study to integrate various RECONS methods with SampleNet. It's important to note that SampleNet is an MLP that takes the features of pixel \\[i,j\\] and the coordinate values as input, predicting their shifting directly. Since the Nearest and Bilinear RECONS methods could not generate the pixel features as the implicit representations do, we directly utilize the encoder from the implicit representations for a fair comparison. The experimental results are shown in Table 1.1.\n\nTable 1.1: Comparing different reconstruction methods.\n\n| RECONS                  | SA    | RA    | Avg.  |\n| ----------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Nearest                 | 93.46 | 0.96  | 47.21 |\n| Bilinear                | 92.61 | 79.20  | 85.91 |\n| Implicit Representation | 91.70  | 89.72 | 90.71 |\n\n\nAs depicted in the table, despite having a high SA, Nearest RECONS lack the capability to defend against adversarial attacks. This limitation arises from its ability to acquire only the pixel values originally sampled from the images. The Bilinear RECONS exhibit superior RA in comparison to the Nearest RECONS and outperform basic image resampling methods under Bilinear RECONS showcased in Table 1 of the paper, highlighting the effectiveness of SampleNet. Compared to these two RECONS, the implicit representation RECONS achieves an even higher RA and Avg., demonstrating their superiority over these two RECONS. Overall, the data from the table suggests that Nearest and Bilinear RECONS are less effective than implicit representation-based methods when integrated with SampleNet.\n\nWe have added the discussion to our manuscript (Appendix A.6)."

                        "value": "**W2. The learned shift map contains explainable information, however, analysis of which is lacking. The only visualization shown in Fig 2 contains little information and a deeper analysis should be adopted.**\n\nThanks for the helpful suggestion.\n\nTo explain the effectiveness of the shift map, we here analyze and understand the changes in image semantics when the learned shift map is applied or not.  We approach this by examining the features in the middle layer and exploring the decision rationale behind image classification. This dual-perspective approach helps clarify the shift map's effectiveness.\n\nFirstly, we delve into analyzing the features to comprehend how the semantics of the images evolve and perform PCA to visualize the analysis. We randomly selected 100 images from one category and obtained the features of clean images (Clean), adversarial images (Adv), adversarial images after implicit reconstruction (RECONS(Adv)), and adversarial images after IRAD (IRAD(Adv)). We computed the mean in each dimension of the features of clean images to establish the central point of these clean features. Subsequently, we computed the Euclidean distance between the features of other images and the center of clean images. As shown in Table 1.2a, the average Euclidean distance of adversarial image features is significantly distant from clean image features. After the reconstruction of implicit representation, the adversarial image features become closer to the center of clean images' features. By utilizing IRAD, the distance becomes even closer.\nThe PCA findings also illustrate a comparable phenomenon. As depicted in Figure 5 (Appendix A.8), clean adversarial images are notably distant from clean images. After the reconstruction of implicit representation, there are fewer samples situated far from clean images. Moreover, significantly fewer images lie outside the clean distribution after employing IRAD.\nTherefore, this demonstrates that the shift map generated by SampleNet can notably reduce semantic disparity and bring adversarial and clean representations into closer alignment.\n\nTable 1.2a: The comparison of feature distances.\n\n| Comparison            | Euclidean Distance |\n| --------------------- | :------------------: |\n| Clean and Adv         | 2.91               |\n| Clean and RECONS(Adv) | 1.21               |\n| Clean and IRAD(Adv)   | 0.75               |\n\n\n\n\nSecondly, we follow the methodology of previous research to conduct decision rationale analysis through decision path analysis [1][2][3][4], aiming to understand the decision-making process following resampling. These studies highlight \"decision paths\" in neural networks, formed by critical nodes like highly contributive neurons at each layer. These paths reflect the network's semantic information flow for specific data sets. When the decision paths of two data groups are similar, it indicates closely aligned decision rationales and semantics, revealing how the network interprets and identifies different data. Thus, we obtain the decision paths of Adv, RECONS(Adv), and IRAD(Adv), and calculate their cosine similarity with the decision path of clean images. As shown in Table 1.2b, after the reconstruction of implicit representation, the decision path becomes more similar. By using IRAD, the similarity (i.e. 0.9987) becomes even higher. These results demonstrate that after resampling, our method exhibits a closer alignment with the decision rationales and semantics observed in clean images.\n\nTable 1.2b: The comparison of decision paths.\n\n| Comparison            | Similarity |\n| --------------------- | :----------: |\n| Clean and Adv         | 0.5482     |\n| Clean and RECONS(Adv) | 0.9915     |\n| Clean and IRAD(Adv)   | 0.9987     |\n\n\n\nThese two experiments further highlight the effectiveness of our resampling technique in disrupting adversarial textures and mitigating adversarial attacks. The tables of experimental results and the PCA result are included in the Appendix (A.8).\n\n[1] Khakzar, Ashkan, et al. \"Neural response interpretation through the lens of critical pathways.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2021.\n\n[2] Li, Tianlin, et al. \"Understanding adversarial robustness via critical attacking route.\" Information Sciences 547 (2021): 568-578.\n\n[3] Wang, Yulong, et al. \"Interpret neural networks by identifying critical data routing paths.\" proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2018.\n\n[4] Qiu, Yuxian, et al. \"Adversarial defense through network profiling based path extraction.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2019."

In fact, we include the running time cost comparison in Table 5 of our manuscript. The results show that DiffPure takes 132 ms per image, which is time-consuming. Our IRAD+DiffPure (t=20) method achieves comparable SA and RA with DiffPure, and it's about five times faster. It should also be noted that the running time cost statistics are consistent under other adversary scenarios.\n\n**Q1. Are there any severe distortions in the shift map?**\n\nThank you for your comments. We assess distortions from both visual and semantic perspectives.\n\nAs highlighted in the 'More Visualization Results' section of Appendix A.9, our visual examination reveals that the resampled images closely resemble the clean images, with no significant distortions due to the shift map.\n\nAdditionally, as detailed in our answer to W2, we investigate the impact of the shift map on the features in the middle layer and the decision-making process in image classification. Our findings demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs images without causing major semantic distortions. The details of these semantic evaluations are presented in Appendices A.7 and A.8."
