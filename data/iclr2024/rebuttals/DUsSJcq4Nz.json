To accomplish this, various strategies, such as warm-up regression and some formulas for variable range requirements, are incorporated. Through experimentation on three datasets, it is substantiated that the model not only outperforms its counterparts but also operates at a lower computational cost."

For instance, in the case of Figure 3 (see questions below). See Figure 2, the author even used variable names from the code, which makes reading this paper highly inconvenient.\n\n- I believe that the FFM-head may not always yield benefits across all types of heart diseases. Could the authors provide a theoretical analysis and summary about which kinds of heart diseases are best suited for this approach and which ones are not? Additionally, it would be valuable to investigate whether FMM exhibits particular advantages in scenarios where training data is limited, and whether the performance gains become insignificant when an ample training set is available.\n\n- There must be some DL models for anomaly detection that is not AE-based. It is important to compare with them and observe if we really need to use the FMM-head."

There are so many arrows, but it is hard to know their meaning.\n\n- How to implement \"Circular-to-Linear\" is not given.\n\n- It is not clear how to do anomaly detection by AE. Though authors said \"AEs are state-of-the-art models for anomaly detection (Chalapathy & Chawla, 2019). AEs are trained on normal data so that abnormal samples during test phases can straightforwardly be recognized.\" But it is still not clear for readers how this works. You may give something concrete (e.g., by equation), especially similar operations are exerted on your model.\n\n- Given that FMM is a recently introduced methodology, I am uncertain about its widespread acceptance within the medical community and whether subsequent research has substantiated its efficacy. This uncertainty also extends to the potential value of the FMM-HEAD."

While the general area of anomaly detection is broad and important, the method only explores AE setups. It is not clear how relevant and important this is since AEs are not the only way of ECG anomaly detection. There are also no indications as to how generalizable this solution is.\n\n- The paper claims that existing models \"do not consider the specific patterns of ECG leads and are unexplainable black boxes\". I would like to challenge both notions. First, it is completely possible that the ECG patterns and PQRST waveforms are implicitly learned by existing methods. There is no evidence that they are \"not considered\". It would be hard to imagine how prior works produce valid results without learning the waveforms. Second, the \"black box\" argument is not well-founded. There are many studies that have analyzed and interpreted the performance of other methods.\n\n- The writing can be improved by removing very simple notions such as Pearson's correlation (page 5) and other well-known concepts.\n\n- There seems to be a gap in the logic of the paper. The paper states \"The parameters obtained after the activation function are used to reconstruct an ECG time-series X\u02c6 for anomaly detection. We leverage this weak a priori knowledge drawn from the FMM formulation to better reconstruct the input ECG signal.\" How is this considered 'a priori knowledge'? and why is it 'weak'? How is this different from using a standard decoder in terms of reconstruction based extracted features of one form or another?\n\n- The experiment setup requires substantial improvements as only 5 AE-based methods are used. Are these the only methods that can be used for ECG anomaly detection? what about non-AE methods?"
