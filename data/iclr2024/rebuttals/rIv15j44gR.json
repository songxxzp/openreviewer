                    "value": "This paper formalizes the problem of estimating treatment effects with delayed responses. While most of the literature focuses on estimating treatment effects that occur immediately after treatment administration, the authors argue that it is more reasonable to assume that treatment effects occur after an unknown time delay. The authors demonstrate identifiability for delayed treatment effect estimates and delayed treatment effect times under extended assumptions. In addition, the authors propose an extension of counterfactual regression (CFR) to account for delayed treatment effects. To this end, they use an expectation maximization algorithm to combine estimates of delayed response time with the CFR and call this algorithm the delayed feedback counterfactual regression (CFR-DF). Finally, the authors validate their method on several synthetic and semisynthetic data sets."

                    "value": "- The method is fairly straightforward (and, to a large extent, similar to existing works).\n- The motivation of this work is unclear: Medical studies typically consider a sufficiently large time window for the treatment response to be observed, such that in all relevant datasets *the eventual outcome is known*. Hence, there is no need for a method that considers delayed response time, as this is simply a data preprocessing issue.\n- Therefore, it would be a much fairer comparison to train the baselines on the eventual outcomes. I doubt that CFR-DF outperforms baselines that are trained on correctly formatted data.\n- This work is, as pointed out in the RW section, related to censored HTE estimation under time-to-event data. The authors claim that the difference of their work is that they consider observable outcomes $Y^t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ that eventually have a positive outcome (\"conversion in uplift modeling\"), while the cited literature focuses on negative outcomes (such as death of a patient). However, I wonder how this makes any difference from a technical perspective, as this is purely interpretation of the user. Methodologically, this should not make any difference (e.g., whether $Y^t=1$ denotes death of a patient or a positive treatment outcome).\n- The assumptions are fairly strong. Especially, Monotonicity and Principal Ignorability are quite restrictive for identifiability. Further, time independence seems unrealistic to me. Here, the authors claim that observation times may not affect potential response times, which seems plausible. However, the effect could be the other way around. In the dynamic treatment literature, it is a known issue that observation time are, in reality, intertwined with the patient's health condition (known as \"informative sampling\").\n- There are methods available for long term outcome targeting where short term proxies are available (which is, admittedly, a slightly different setting). IMHO it would be fair to acknowledge this literature stream. I believe this scenario is more realistic in practice.\n- A few minor concerns: \n\ta. The authors use an exponential distribution to model the response time in their method, such that the integral over the response time (the one w.r.t. $u$) reduces to a simple exponential function. If a different model for the response time is used (e.g., the suggested non-parametric), I wonder how the integral can be solved and the algorithm trained with reasonable computational complexity.\n\tb. In the text before equation (2), I think it should be \"$T=t$\" and not \"$T=t>d$\". If we assume that $t>d$, then $P(\\tilde{Y}^t=0 \\mid X=x, W=w, Y=1) = 0)$. I don't think this is what the authors intended.\n\tc. What is the function class in the IPM?\n\td. Since the authors simulate the outcomes and response times on the AIDDS, JOBS and TWINS datasets, I would suggest to call these \"semi-synthetic\" instead of \"real-word\" datasets.\n\te. A few of the cited arXiv papers have already been published ((Nagpal et al., 2022), (Nie et al., 2021), (Alaa et al., 2017))."

                    "value": "- What is the relevance of the current work in practice? Given that medical algorithms are commonly not trained online, what is the relevance of the added time dimension when learning the method? With other words, why can't you remove the time dimension, use the eventual outcome (instead of the artificially simulated observed outcome), and use CFR instead of CFR-DF?\n- How does the method compare to traditional censoring approaches in the literature? In particular, why cannot a model from this literature stream be used, where \"survival time\" is interpreted as \"time until feedback is positve\"?\n- Could you clarify why time independence is a reasonable assumption?"

Much of sections 3 and 4 are already well established:\n\n*\tEquation (4) is the definition of a mixture cure model (see equation 1 in [1]).\n\n*\tSimilar EM algorithms are commonly used for these models, see for example [2] and [3].\n\n*\tIdentifiability results for similar cure models are well established, see [4] and [5].\n\nThe primary novelty appears to be the application of the CFR to cure models. This is potentially a valuable contribution but is not how the paper is currently framed. Furthermore, a significant amount of related work is omitted (see, for example, many of the references cited in [1])\n\n**Experiments**: The data generating process for the synthetic data closely matches the DGP for CFR-DF but none of the baseline comparison models, so superior performance is expected by construction. While useful as a confirmatory study for your implementation, the comparison to these models is misleading. Instead, comparison to models that assume delayed feedback, such as [6], [7], or a standard Cox PH or AFT linear cure model, would be more convincing of the efficacy of the proposed model.\n\n\nReferences:\n> [1] Mailis Amico, Ingrid Van Keilegom.

                    "value": "The paper proposes to estimate the heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) that are observed with delay. The potential response time is considered in the process of estimating HTE. Theoretical analyses show the identifiability and empirical results show improved performance against baseline methods for delayed effects."

                    "value": "- The paper is overall well written and I find it easy to follow the main idea and theoretical development.\n- The paper identifies a very important problem of delayed effect, which is not well addressed by existing studies.\n- The theoretical analysis looks sound and the identifiability is formally established, which provides some theoretical guarantee for the learning algorithm proposed.\n- The learning algorithm looks solid and is described in detail. The empirical experiments show improved results against baseline methods."

                    "value": "- The empirical evaluations include only relatively small datasets. Although they are useful for benchmarking, it would be better to see how the model scales to larger datasets with more variables.\n- The monotonicity assumption may hold for some applications, but not always. It would be great to see some analysis of the identifiability when this assumption does not hold.\n- Figure 3 in the supplemental materials provides important insights into the proposed architecture and it would make the presentation much clearer to move it to the main text."

However, Assumption 4 implies that the treatment considered would not be harmful to all individuals. Could the authors provide more clarification on this conflicting?"
