To ensure a fair comparison, we controlled for key factors like training code, optimization algorithm, and hardware across all experiments.

At least we need another data point: a direct comparison to the current best SOTA. From the figure 2, I believe that the comparison with SOTA will lead to much smaller reduction percentages.\n\n(2) A drawback in figure 2 is that it\u2019s hard to justify the advantage of the proposed READ method by just a single data point. Ideally, it\u2019d be helpful to have multiple data points for READ, under different energy/memory consumptions, in order to build a \u201cPareto curve\u201d. In this way, it\u2019d be much easier to tell whether READ advances the whole Pareto frontier.\n\n(3) In Table 1, it is unfair to only try the proposed method on the larger T5-large. You need to also try other methods + larger T5 in order to prove your points.\n\n(4) As the authors also mentioned in limitation section, it\u2019d be great to add evaluation on GPT-style models and corresponding downstream tasks.\n\n(5) To me, the overall proposed idea make sense but not very exciting. It seems more like an incremental work compared to existing methods (the RNN being the only main novelty)."

                    "value": "- I find the notion of recurrence in this paper somewhat tricky. Typically,  Recurrent neural networks process the input sequentially by taking one token as the input at a time and updating the hidden state. However, in this paper, recurrence does not occur in the sequence level. Instead, it occurs at the model layer level, which seems non-standard for me. I highly recommend the authors to clarify this to avoid confusions.\n\n- The scope of the method and experiment seems narrow. It only considers the encoder-decoder Transformers on a single natural language understanding benchmark. I believe the paper will be strengthened significantly by introducing more Transformer settings (e.g., decoder only) and/or more benchmark datasets (e.g., other NLP/vision tasks).\n\n- Training time is not reported in this experiment. I believe it is important to add this Information for a comprehensive comparison among different methods.\n\n- Currently the presentation of the paper is flawed. There are many formatting issues which impedes readability.\n  - In the abstract on OpenReview, Latex commands (`\\textbf`) are not deleted. $\\\\%$ is missing in the discussion of the reduction in memory consumption and GPU energy usage.\n  - The format of citation is bad in this paper. The authors should have used `\\citet` and `\\citep` appropriately.\n  - In the abstract, the first letter of \"Transformer\" is capitalized but in the main body of the paper it's not. The authors should make this consistent and I recommend to always capitalize the first letter of \"Transformer\".\n  - Missing references. \"Appendix ??\" and \"Table ??\" in Sec. 4.\n  - Bad notation. Eq. (4) uses $\\bar U$ to denote a cumulative sum. This can be misleading because people are more likely to interpret $\\bar U$ as an average.\n\n- Minor comments.\n  - Abstract. \"empirical evaluation of the GLUE benchmark\" $\\to$ \"empirical evaluation on the GLUE benchmark\".\n  - Page 4. \"the following equation systems gives\" $\\to$ \"the following equation system gives\"\n  - Page 4. \".\" is missing in the last sentence of the last paragraph."

                        "value": "### Notion of Recurrency\nWe believe that using the recurency at the model hidden state level is the key behind our method effectiveness. By operating at the model hidden state level, READ does not grow the number of trainable parameters as model sizes increase like other methods, lowering inference cost and fine-tune cost compared to other PEFT methods. The recurrence nature of RNN allows information to flow from one layer to the next, which is why READ outperforms other PETL methods. Last, our\nfine-tuning is transformer-free as only RNN and Feed-Forward Network (FNN) structures are used in READ and require no transformer or attention mechanism. \n\n### Scope of experiments and method\nWe appreciate the reviewer's suggestions on extending READ to more tasks. In response to the reviewer\u2019s valuable insights, we have extended our experimentation to include the MSCOCO dataset using T5-clip model. Notably, our findings remain consistent: READ consistently outperforms most PEFT baselines, while nearly matching the performance of the Adapter, with 68% reduction in training memory consumption. This is highlighted in the provided table below\n\n|               | Full  | Adapter | LoRA  | Prompt | BitFit | READ  |\n|---------------|-------|---------|-------|--------|--------|-------|\n| CIDEr         | 91.9  | 83.4    | 69.5  | 65.2   | 33.6   | 81.7  |\n| Train memory  | 21.20 | 13.38   | 8.16  | 8.39   | 15.77  | 3.88  |\n\n\n### Training Time\nTo provide a comprehensive understanding, we include an analysis below to show the mean and standard deviation for the sums of GPU energy, epochs to convergence, and training time across all GLUE tasks. While this analysis does reveal some variations in energy/time levels, they are not significantly substantial to alter the general trend, as READ continues to stand out as the most energy-efficient approach, with faster convergence than most baselines except for full-tuning. We believe this further supports the merits of our proposed method, and we will include this detailed analysis and clarification in our revised paper.\n\n|              | Full     | Adapter | LoRA   | Prompt | BitFit | LST     | READ  |\n|--------------|----------|---------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------|\n| Energy (kWh) | 12.52| 6.99 | 10.58| 6.45| 7.68| 10.59 | 2.06|\n| Time (mins)  | 472.74| 485.25| 409.41| 315.35| 291.89| 984.55| 155.11|\n\n### Normalization in Figure 1\nNormalized here means to the normalized energy consumption relative to full-tuning on GLUE tasks. With full tuning as 1.0 and the PEFT methods as a fraction of full tuning energy consumption."
