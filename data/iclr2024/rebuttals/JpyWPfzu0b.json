However, I think it is important to study the scaling results to check the effectiveness on a larger scale. Can the SigLIP still be so effective when using a larger vision encoder and language models? It would also be interesting to further scale down the model and see what would happen."

I think it would be nice to have an open-sourced version (would be better to use open-sourced data to pretrain) and will be easy to compare and use this model as a baseline. This model is small. If you can provide a fully reproducable version, I believe more folks from GPT-poor institutes would be motivated to follow.\n2) I understand this paper's setting is not a huge model with a very strong zero-shot ability like GPT-4V. However, I'm highly interested in what do authors think about the potential of using SigLIP as the vision encoder for real LLMs (maybe > 100B or so).\n3) Could you provide a detailed discussion about the difference between PaLI-3 and the previous versions? It would be better to have a table and show the differences directly."

We would like to note that we do not claim contrastively pretrained visual encoder is always superior to a classification-pretrained one for all purposes. Instead, we reported our observations on contrastively trained SigLIP that \u201cdespite SigLIP slightly underperforming on image classification, it performs much better on Visual Language tasks.\u201d (See our contribution #1) with a focus on the relative advantage of contrastively trained models on VL tasks, which we believe holds true for similarly trained models including OpenCLIP. That said, we agree with the reviewer that the comparison to OpenCLIP may provide a complementary datapoint for the community. We are working on setting up and performing such a comparison and are trying to add an additional baseline based on OpenCLIP before the final version of the draft.\n\n\n**[W2]**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that it is important to study the scaling laws to check the effectiveness on a larger scale. The result in Table 1 is about the scaling behavior, where we first tested SigLIP sizes B/16 and L/16, and the promising scaling behavior was exactly what drove us to push SigLIP to 2B (G/14) parameter scale used for PaLI-3.\n\n**[W3]**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Please see the two main points below. We will expand and add to the revised paper.\n- PaLI-3 used SigLIP pretrained ViT, while previous versions used the classification pretrained ones.\n- The training mixture of PaLI-3 is based on the learnings of PaLI-X, with a few key new components, including the further filtered and refined WebLI dataset, especially on the OCR data, and we curated and added web-scale document images in the training.\n\n**[Q1] Code release**\n\nWe are actively working on a potential open-sourcing of our model, however there are still aspects related to the open-sourcing effort that we are still figuring out.\n\n**[Q2] Using SigLIP for much larger LLMs**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Indeed, we are also very interested in the potential of SigLIP in large LLMs. We plan to explore this in the followup work with the potentially further scaled-up SigLIP variants.\n\n**[Q3] Difference between PaLI-3 and previous versions. Similar to W3**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Please see what we listed above, and we will expand and add to the revised paper"

Our comprehensive experiments show that **there is not a simple winner**: while the contrastively pretrained SigLIP models still lose to the discriminatively trained counterparts on visual classification tasks, SigLIP-based PaLI-3 shows superior performance on Vision-Language tasks. We believe that our experiments provide concrete data points and insights to the community beyond just intuitions.\n\n**[Regarding the second point from the reviewer]**\n\nIn this work, we made substantial improvements over the PaLI training recipe. Our contributions to the training mixture is generally applicable. Even in the reviewer\u2019s own hypothetical statements, \u201cActually incorporating these improvements could probably benefit any other model compared with the proposed one.\u201d, the reviewer acknowledged the significance of our training recipe. \n\nIt was very surprising to us as authors that such a compact model (at only 5B) was able to outperform a related but much larger-capacity model (PaLI-X at 55B) across so many tasks. One of the goals of this paper was to highlight what parts would be responsible for such a surprising result, and we consider that the research community would be equally interested in understanding it."

Specifically, the authors claim that because SigLIP shows better performance than the classification-pretrained visual encoder used by PaLI and PaLI-X, they conclude that a contrastively pretrained visual encoder is superior to a classification-pretrained one. However, it's worth noting that most of the accessible contrastively pretrained visual encoders for the vision and vision-language community are members of the OpenCLIP family. Have you ever attempted to utilize OpenCLIP as a vision encoder?\n- The results in Section 4 are per-benchmark finetuned. What's the performance of PaLI-3 without task-specific fine-tuning (zero-shot)? Is it possible to generate target answers with few-shot demonstrations by prompting (in-context learing)?\n- As mentioned in Section 3.2, during stage 0 of PaLI-3's training process, the contrastive visual encoder is pretrained with a 3B UL2 as a text encoder-decoder. Subsequently, the same 3B UL2 model is employed as the language model for PaLI-3. Is this consistency in using the same language model for both contrastive visual pre-training and generative vision-language pre-training crucial or not? Have any experiments been conducted on this?"

                        "value": "**[W1]**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We would like to note that we do not claim that \u201ccontrastively pretrained visual encoder is superior to a classification-pretrained one for all purposes\u201d. Instead, we reported our observations on contrastively trained SigLIP that \u201cdespite SigLIP slightly underperforming on image classification, it performs much better on Visual Language tasks.\u201d (See our contribution #1) with a focus on the relative advantage of contrastively trained models on VL tasks, which we believe holds true for similarly trained models including OpenCLIP.\n\nFor OpenCLIP, We have not tried it at the time of submission, since SigLIP is also open-source and significantly better across benchmarks. However, we agree this can be an interesting ablation, for which we have started to set up and are trying to add an additional baseline based on OpenCLIP before the final version of the draft.\n\n**[W2]**\n\nWe expect the zero-shot performance to be relatively poor, since there is no task aimed for this in the pre-training mixture, and hence the model cannot know \"the coco vocabulary\" from which it should generate. PaLI-3 is also not a chatbot, but rather a (compact) foundation model capable to be transferred to various tasks.\n\nMeanwhile, few-shot in-context ability is a good idea that we could and likely should add in the pre-training mixture, and would provide an in-between alternative between fine-tuning and zero-shot.\n\n**[W3]**\n\nThanks for the question, it highlights an unclarity in the write-up. The stage0 pre-training does not use a UL2 encoder-decoder. It is trained with a transformer encoder for the text with a similar size to ViT-L, following SigLIP (and like CLIP), which we then discard in the following stages. Thus, no such consistency in the language model is required. We will emphasize this aspect better in the paper\u2019s next version."
