For this purpose, they proposed a method, Prototypes-Injected Prompt (PIP), which introduces prototype injection, augmentation, and weighted Gaussian aggregation. By comparing this model with the baselines, they showed that the proposed model  outperforms existing methods by 14-33% in CIFAR100, MiniImageNet, and TinyImageNet datasets."

In order to make the contributions of the article clearer and easier to understand, the following issues need to be addressed:\n1. Based on Fig. 1, a concrete model diagram of the proposed prototypes-injected prompt (PIP) approach should be given in Section IV, incorporating the dual-prompt, prototype augmentation, and server weighted Gaussian aggregation modules.\n2. Although the experimental part of the article proves that the performance improvement of PIP is significant, we notice that PIP uses a different backbone than the comparison method, which is very unfair. It is recommended to compare under the same backbone.\n3. The readers will be more excited to see more local clients involved than fewer local clients involved. As we konw, in the practical application of FCIL, we always want to solve the problem for more clients. It is recommended to add and analyze the performance of the situation.\n4. The model was trained and tested only on smaller datasets. How does it perform on slightly larger datasets, such as ImageNet-R or DomainNet?\n5. In real-world FCIL problems, the number of clients and the training ratio of each client is unknown, so whether weighting by ratio is necessary. Also, in the ablation experiments, The weighted aggregation module improves the performance very limited and this module may increase the complexity of the model.\n6. Please add the experiments of PIP under three datasets at T=10. Also, the total number of classes for the three datasets in Fig2 is incorrectly labeled, The CIFAR100 and miniImageNet datasets each contain 100 classes. \n7. There are a lot of math symbols in the article, so check to make sure that a specific explanation is given for each symbol. For example, w_c2^tfor prototype augmentation in the proposed method, when lowercase w means.\n8. In the related work section, GLVC Dong et al. (2022) should be GLFC Dong et al. (2022). Please check carefully in the article for the same error."
