The proposed model consists of multiple customized self-attention blocks which compute the similarities between different samples and fuse them according to the similarities. In the final layer, the model is trained to minimize the KL-Divergence between the computed similarity matrix and the target similarity matrix based on classes of the sample."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "One of the major drawbacks of this paper is lack of necessary experiments, the existing experimental results are too few to validate effectiveness of TransFusion. In this paper, all the numerical results can be used for comparison are only included in the Table 3, where the authors compare the classification accuracy between ResNet18 models trained with SupCon and TransFusion on CIFAR-10. \n\nIn the current experiment designs, the authors add an one-layer TransFusion to ResNet-18 pre-trained on ImageNet-1K and fine-tune the model on CIFAR-10 dataset. Then they extract intermediate output from the ResNet as embeddings, which are used as the input of SVM or KNN for final classification.\n\nIn my opinion, the authors should at least provide the following experimental results:\n\n(1) Experimental results of models trained with TransFusion and more counterparts for comparison from scratch. \n\n(2) Experimental results on different datasets. For example, SupCon provides results (training from scratch) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K. It also provides results (fine-tuning) on 12 natural image datasets.\n\n(3) Experimental results of models trained with standard TransFusion. Since the authors have trained a 5-layer TransFusion model for the fashionMNIST dataset and 15-layer model for CIFAR10 dataset, I'm confusing why the authors only provide the t-sne visualization results without their classification accuracies. The existing classification results are obtained from the pre-trained ResNet-18 backbone with an one-layer TransFusion, which is different from the architecture of the TransFusion model shown in Figure 1.\n\n(4) Experimental results of models trained with TransFusion without SVM and KNN. Only providing classification results using traditional machine learning methods is not enough.\n\n(5) More ablation experiments. For example, the performance difference between TransFusion model using standard self-attention (between pixels) and proposed self-attention (between samples).\n\nThe other major drawback of TransFusion is the instability introduced by the self-attention mechanism between different samples. A TransFusion model consists of attention blocks which compute attention between different samples. It means that if we feed a batch of samples to a TransFusion model, the model may classify a sample into different classes if the other samples change. I'm worry about the effect of \"batch\" on performance of TransFusion. Such instability will make the design unpractical."

                    "value": "I'm wondering about the effect of \"batch\" on performance of TransFusion.\n\n(1) How the number of classes affects the performance of TransFusion model? When the number of classes gets larger, there will be much fewer samples in a batch which belong to the same class. Will the self-attention mechanism between samples still work under such condition? \n\n(2) How the batch size affects the inference speed of TransFusion model?\n\n(3) How the training batch size affects the performance of TransFusion model? \n\n(4) How the testing batch size affects the performance of TransFusion model? Speficially, if we set batch size to 1, will the performance of TransFusion model sharply decrease?\n\n(5) I'm also wondering the mean and variance of classification accuracies of TransFusion model with different random permutations of samples in a dataset."

The presentation of this paper could be improved. It is relatively difficult to read for the interpretation part of the method, and it is difficult for readers to efficiently obtain useful information from the article. The author should use as clear a figure and process expression as possible to make the specific content statement of the method clearer and provide more implementation details to improve the reproducibility of the paper.\n\n3). The author should show the effect of this method on more different types of datasets and more difficult datasets to show the robustness of the method in different scenarios and different problems. In my opinion, the experiments and comparisons provided by this article are insufficient. In particular, the effect of contrastive learning is usually more effective on large-scale datasets. However, all the experiments conducted in this paper are with very small datasets and small network architectures. In this case, the drawed conclusions might not be generalizable."
