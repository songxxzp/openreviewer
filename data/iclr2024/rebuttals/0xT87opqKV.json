                    "value": "Numerous recent works have proposed pre-trained large protein models based on either protein sequences or protein structures. This work proposes a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method called ProteinAdapter. Based on cross-attention blocks, ProteinAdapter merges representations from multiple levels, i.e., ESM1b representations based on 1D sequence and ESM-IF1 representations based on 3D structures. Additionally, the authors propose a multi-scale predictor on top of the ProteinAdapter to extract condensed final representations hierarchically. They claim that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in over 20 tasks under both single-task and multi-task settings."

While this is not the first hybrid approach to protein language models (ESM-GearNet proposed sequential pre-training of sequence and structures), it seems novel. If the proposed method is effective in terms of efficiency and performance, as the authors claimed, it will benefit a broad range of researchers working on various protein biology tasks."

                    "value": "- [Novelty] Utilizing cross-attention for multi-modal representations is a fairly common approach, particularly for vision-language models. It seems the paper did not discuss the relevant previous works properly.\n- [Introduction] The paper generally describes the ProteinAdapter as it takes the representations from ESM-1b and ESM-IF1 (e.g. in Intro). However, since a significant amount of experiments conducted on PEER do not utilize ESM-IF1, I think the paper is quite misleading.\n- [Related Work] I believe stating ESM-GearNet as non-parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is not appropriate. The focus of the work was more on the subsequent pretraining on protein structures from the AlphaFold Database, rather than fine-tuning for downstream tasks.\n- [Methods] The paper lacks explanations on ESM-1b and ESM-IF1 even though they are critical components throughout the manuscript. \n- [Training Setup] I\u2019m confused about which method the authors used to cope with the lack of structural information for the PEER benchmark. Can you confirm that the authors simply replaced the structural embedding with another layer of sequence embedding throughout the paper?\n- [Training Setup] What do you mean by \u201cwe only conducted multi-level performance tests on the Stability Prediction and Fold Classification tasks?\u201d What are the results in Table 2-4? It seems quite misleading.\n- [Sec 4.3 Multi-Task setting] How do you define which one is primary among multi-tasks? It seems the authors did not try to decrease the loss from supportive tasks by setting alpha less than 1. In my view, since the authors stated \"multi-task\", the model must be evaluated on multiple tasks rather than a single primary task.\n- [Table 2-3] It's unclear how much the proposed ProteinAdapter contributes to the performance improvement. For Table 2, can you provide a comparison with other ways to use representations from multiple layers? For Table 3, can you provide a comparison with the fine-tuning performance of ESM-IF1?\n- [Table 3] I thought the authors used embeddings from a different layer of ESM1b instead of structural embeddings. If so, interpreting results as \u201cIt can be observed that since\nour method has already made full use of the structural information, using structure prediction tasks as an auxiliary does not significantly improve the performance of the central task. However,\u201d does not seem like a logical explanation.\n- [Table 5] It does not seem like a fair comparison. Simply removing the adapter or predictor significantly decreases model capability (in terms of parameters). There should be more competitive baselines instead of off-the-shelf removals. For example, for the w/o multi-scale predictor, how about just removing the final merge operation?\n- [Baselines] How did the authors conduct baseline experiments in Table 2-5? If they, fine-tuned the entire pretrained model ESM-1b on downstream tasks, it would not be a common practice. Can you provide more baseline results by fine-tuning 1-2 dense layers on top of the frozen pretrained model?\n\nMinor comments\n- [Missing references] (1) In the Introduction section, references are missing for ESM-1b and ESM-IF1 in the IN. The references are provided later on. (2) In the Methods section, it seems references are needed for the statement \u201cdue to genetic differences, the scale of the same functional regions is often inconsistent across different species.\u201d"
