We addressed this in the manuscript and added respective references.\n\nAddressing the Weaknesses:\n\nWe see that we currently do not stress how the number of parameters is influenced by the addition of the resonator. We added a paragraph that is aimed to clarify this. Here we want to emphasize that the number of parameters of a RG-LSTM with 128 units is significantly smaller that an LSTM with 129 units. Because the addition of a single hidden neuron is typically negligible the change in behavior must lie in the added inductive bias. \n\nThe benefits seem to arise from an interplay of a 'periodic gating' that feed (and receives its gradient from) a stable 'rotating' memory. We added a derivation that essentially shows that the gradient flow within the resonator is stably maintained - it thus acts like an additional error carousel (cf. CEC in LSTMs). While this does not prove the extraction or learning of frequencies it gives some indication that this can be the case as the inductive bias of the resonator primes it towards periodically picking up information and adding it to the memory."

However a lot has happend since 2016. Attention based systems like transformers have since emerged as a popular alternative to RNNs for sequence modelling tasks, unfortunately this development is not discussed in the related work. In the vision domain Trainsformers are known to struggle on small data-sets (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/c81e155d85dae5430a8cee6f2242e82c-Paper.pdf).

QTDB stands for QT Database where QT is the waveform interval in ECGs. We added a remark in the manuscript. \n\nWe will provide respective seeds with publication of the code. But we do not agree with this argument: if the method is sufficiently stable, randomized trials (which can be replicated) that deliver reasonable performance are more convincing than choosing some well working seeds. Moreover, in contrast to the LSTM, the standard deviation for all random runs of the RG-RNN is extremely narrow.  \n\nWe agree that - even if unlikely - a few additional weights could in principle make a difference. While the number of parameters was higher for the RG-LSTM the difference is less pronounced than comparing the LSTM with an LSTM that has just a single additional hidden unit. To clarify we will report the number of parameters for LSTM and RG-LSTM. In addition we can retrain an LSTM with an additional hidden unit e.g. 129 for SMNIST. The performance impact of this will be negligible based on first evaluations.\n\nAddressing the Weaknesses:\n\nWe further extend on current sequence learning advances and especially on the connections to attention-based models and recent SSMs and LRU."

We would be happy to include respective results in the manuscript. However, we think that it does not really make sense to incorporate transformers. These two architectures are fundamentally different, whereas our research question was to study, what a resonating circuit adds to an RNN, or more specifically, to an LSTM (the latter is still frequently used as a sequence learning model). In fact we demonstrate an immense gain of convergence speed and stability just with an moderate architectural modification without the need for additional explicit regularization."

The resonator is defined based on the discrete time version of a `resonate-and-fire` neuron model and is of similar computational cost as the existing LSTM gates. The authors evaluate the performance of RG-RNN against LSTMs on four time-series dataset and demonstrate greatly improved training stability, convergence behavior and performance in almost all cases."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the value comments and suggestions. Please find our responses below.\n\nTo properly answer the reviewers first question we would need some more information of the type of experiment that was in mind. It would be possible to perform the experiment conducted for Figure 1, but it would be difficult to make any statements about the output because it is randomly initialized and untrained. It would in fact be interesting to evaluate the behavior of the RG-RNN in regression tasks (such as time-series forecasting), which is another line of research for us. Our intuition is, however, that the resonator functions primarily as a detector and does not necessarily facilitate the creation of oscillations.\n\nThe resonator-based gating mechanism can be applied to GRUs as well. We think that it would best be applied to the update gate since it regulates how the new inputs are combined with the current hidden state. This is definitely an interesting question and something we will look into - we made a respective comment in the paper. We would assume a similar effect to the network's convergence. But as there is no fundamental and consistent advantage of the GRU over LSTM (there is actually a tendency of the latter working slightly better), we expect the same results when comparing RG-GRUs and RG-LSTMs.\n\nWe see that the term 'static relevant information' is not accurate enough. The type of information that is retained by RNNs is more clearly described as ``transient'', it arises and/or disappears during the sequence.\n\nAddressing the weaknesses: \n\nWe see the demand for more results on another dataset and hence added an analysis of gait trials from sensor data provided on UCI. We agree that adding another data domain can emphasise the strengths as well as give clearer indication of weaknesses of the method."
