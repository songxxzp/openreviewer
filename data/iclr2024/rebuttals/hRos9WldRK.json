                    "value": "- The idea is not novel. To improve the bootstrapping loss, [A] proposes dynamic hard and soft bootstrapping losses by individually weighting each samples. The sample-wise weights mean that the sample whether or not belongs to clean labels. The clean samples rely on their ground-truth labels, while noisy ones let their loss being dominated by their class predict. To determine the weights, [A] use two-component Beta Mixture Model (BMM), and [B] use two-component GMM to fit the max-normalized loss. For meta learning methods, [C] uses learning to reweight techniques and [D] use meta-weight-net techniques to learn weights. As compared, the used techniques in this paper is not novel.\n[A] Arazo, E., Ortego, D., Albert, P., O\u2019Connor, N., McGuinness, K.: Unsupervised label noise modeling and loss correction. In ICML, 2020.\n[B] Li, J., Socher, R., Hoi, S.C.: Dividemix: Learning with noisy labels as semi-supervised learning. In ICLR, 2020.\n[C] Zhang, Z., Zhang, H., Arik, S.O., Lee, H., Pfister, T.: Distilling effective supervision from severe label noise. In CVPR, 2020.\n[D] Shu J, Yuan X, Meng D, et al. Cmw-net: Learning a class-aware sample weighting mapping for robust deep learning[J]. IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 2023.\n\n- Though this paper uses two group weights to bring more freedom to the bootstrapping loss, the motivation is not clear to readers. Though Fig.1(a) shows that original bootstrapping loss is sensitive to the reweighting parameter, it is also suitable for [A-D], since they also deal with such problem. Unfortunately, it is not clear why authors use such more general loss function. Page 3 says it \"treats all examples as equally important during training, which could easily cause overfitting for biased training data.\" This claim is very subjective, and there exist no evidence to support it. Page 4 says \"but rather conducts implicit relabeling during training by reweighting different loss terms\", which is not clear to readers. And I can not find why this bring benifits for the bootstrapping loss.\n\n- Page 4 says \"Note that this form is also similar to self-distillation\". I have checked the form therein. Its form is the convex combination weights in [A,B,C,D]. Thus the folowing claim is not convincing, since [C,D] also use validation set to learn weights in a meta-learning manner.\n\n\n- The display in Fig.4 can not demostrate the effectiveness of proposed method: the weights relationship of the last two columns is not reasonable. When the pseudo label is equal to the noisy label, they have identical weights. If do this, it can not bring benifits for learning, since the learned weights make it overfit the noisy data. This can not explain the effectiveness of proposed method."

L2B can potentially serve as a plug-in module for LNL methods. It would be beneficial to see additional results, especially when L2B is integrated with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, to further test the proposed method's effectiveness.\n\n3. The related work section appears dated. There's a noticeable lack of references from 2023, with most of the cited works being from before 2022 and only three from 2022. It raises the question of whether any recent work from 2023 might have similar ideas. The authors might undertake a more meticulous survey and comparison with the latest SOTA methodologies."

Would the performance see any improvements?\n\n3. The reviewer notes that within L2B, the weights assigned to the clean-label term seem to be the same as the weights for both the pseudo sample and label. Have the authors thought about using different weights for samples and labels? Adopting such a strategy might appear more rational."

While I imagine that performing an exact simplex projection using one of the algorithms for doing so would be slow (mainly because it must be done separately for each sample), have the authors tried other methods besides the softmax or the sigmoid? \n- In the current formulation that does not use the sigmoid or softmax, parameters are allowed to be zero. Is it common for either or both of them to be zero? Could this by why projecting to the interior of the simplex via softmax or sigmoid improves the stability of training? \n- It is not clear to me whether or not a validation set is required. It is mentioned in several places in the paper that a validation set is not required, however, in 3.1, \"In this work, we also assume that there is a small unbiased and clean validation set.\" Can the authors clarify this point?"
