                    "value": "This paper explores the effectiveness of various vision encoders in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). While current MLLM implementations often employ CLIP or its variants for visual understanding and predominantly extract features from the model's deep layers, there is a lack of in-depth analysis of these visual encoders. Through an extensive examination, the authors discover that the shallow layer features of CLIP are especially beneficial for detailed tasks like grounding and region comprehension. Intriguingly, the DINO model, which is not initially trained with text-image alignment, shows significant potential as a visual component in MLLMs. When supplemented with an MLP layer for alignment, DINO outperforms CLIP in tasks demanding finer perception. Based on these insights, the paper introduces a novel feature integration method called COMM, which combines the strengths of both CLIP and DINO via Multi-level features Merging, aiming to enhance the visual proficiency of MLLMs. Evaluations of COMM on multiple benchmarks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination, indicate its superior performance over current methods, highlighting its improved visual competency in MLLMs."

This exploration may give very useful insights into the studies of representation learning.\n3.\tIt also provides a comprehensive comparison of various candidate vision encoders that roughly cover the prominent pretraining strategies such as CLIP, DINO, MAE, and supervised pretraining (DEiT). The findings of MAE and DEiT\u2019s failure to adapt to multi-model tasks are interesting, if the experiments are correctly implemented."

                    "value": "1.\tMy major concern lies in the contributions of this work. The new approach COMM seems more like an ensembling strategy to directly combine CLIP and DINO\u2019s multi-stage visual features. The motivation demonstrated in the paper to introduce DINO features is not really convincing: despite the fact that DINO yields better localized features than CLIP, there exist a lot of simple solutions to overcome this problem such as re-organizing CLIP\u2019s self-attention [1] and learning additional adaptation layers [2]. How would the difference be between your method and such counterparts?\n2.\tAlso, merging multi-layer visual features in vision transformers does not necessarily make sense, because in such models there already exist residual connections between neighboring blocks which means features have already been merged to some extent. Will COMM still be robust if merging the features with an interval (e.g., layer 1, 3, 5, 7\u2026)? This ablation study should be included.\n3.\tThe experimental results do not seem very significant. If my understanding of your method is correct, you by default employ both CLIP and DINO for training and inference. However, your method demonstrates 0.3 lower avg. result than that with single DINO model in the \u201cREC\u201d task and obtains the same results in the absence of DINO in the \u201cPOPE\u201d task.\n4.\tA minor concern comes from the dependence of a well-pretrained DINO. I understand that MAE-like and supervised models cannot achieve the performance you expect, but there are also many contrastive learning-based pretraining models such as MoCo v3, BYOL, as well as iBOT which derives from DINO and shares similar features with it. Is DINO the optimal choice of your method? If so, you should explain why it significantly outperforms other models.\n5.\tMinor comments: overall, the writing of this paper should be improved. Some important details are hard to understand. For example, the authors say \u201cPrevious MLLMs usually utilize\u2026\u201d in the first sentence of Section 3. However, there is no clear reference to indicate which MLLMs did. Such expressions might make readers really confused.\n\n[1] Zhou, Chong, Chen Change Loy, and Bo Dai. \"Extract free dense labels from clip.\" ECCV, 2022.\n\n[2] Gao, Peng, et al. \"Clip-adapter: Better vision-language models with feature adapters.\" IJCV, 2023."

It is thus questionable if the higher performance comes from using high resolution images. The performance of the model trained with 224x224 images should also be provided for fair comparison.\n\n\n-\tThe evaluations in this paper is insufficient. A more thorough comparison in various tasks such as those in [1,2] and recent MLLM benchmarks [3,4] should be provided to comprehensively compare existing methods. Furthermore, the evaluation in LLaVa[5] should be provided to see how much the model is as good as GPT-4.\n\n\n\n-\tThe novelty of this work is limited. This paper claims itself to be the first work to study visual encoders for MLLM. However, existing work [6] has already provided similar investigations. On the other hand, the design of adapting multi-level CLIP features has also been proposed [7]. But the paper lacks discussion and comparison with these works.\n\n\n-\tThe authors provide experiments with a single type of LLM, i.e., Vicuna. It is questionable if the conclusion in this paper is generalizable to other LLMs. The authors should provide experiments with other LLMs such as Flant5-xxl and Llama to justify this. On the other hand, this proposed method is based on frozen visual encoders and only the adapter layers are tuned. How about the performance of jointly tuning the visual encoders? Can the low-level visual feature naturally merge in higher layers of the visual encoder by simply fine-tuning it? \n\n\n-\tSome points claimed in this paper requires further justification or explanation:\n\no\tThis work claims the CLIP visual encoder lacks pixel-level information such as colour and positions. Can the proposed method solve this issue? Experimental results on segmentation-based tasks may help to justify this.\n\no\tWhat are the value of the learned alphas and betas? Are feature in all layers useful for the model?\n\no\tAre all patch features from visual encoder fed into LLM? If yes, this may result in a significantly higher number of tokens than the text side, which leads to higher memory cost and slower inference speed than other methods [1], especially the images are of 336x336 resolution.\n\n\n\n> [1] Dai et al.

Do they all fail because of domain gap and limited zero-shot ability?\n\n2. This submission looks more like a technical blog than an academic paper. The discoveries are nothing amazing, which include\n1) DINOv2 has fine-grained visual information. This is totally expected.\n2) CLIP lacks fine-grained recognition capacity. Everyone knows this.\n3) MAE and DeiT should not be used as visual encoders. Of course, because they are neither trained with text-image pairs nor DINO-style supervision.\n\n3. The proposed structure is straightforward but, to be honest, trivial. The effect is inconsistent across tasks.

Evaluations are generally extensive enough. \n4. The findings are interesting, which could potentially motivate futural study on visual backbone."

                    "value": "1. In Figure 1, it is hard to say whether one has more semantic or low-level visual features. Since the deep layers in CLIP and shallow layers in DINO looks similar in visualization, I can also say they both share high level semantics.\n2. Equ.1 error appears. \n3. Does author needs a pretraining stage for multimodal connector, such as those in LLaVA and Mini-GPT4? In this paper seems like there is no such part. Is directly training LLMs more efficient/effective than conducting a pretraining stage first?"
