                    "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a new self-supervised method for medical time series. Their method, CHRONOS, aims to separate features with different temporal granularity explicitly. For that, they propose three objectives, static, short-term, and long-term dependency, using different projection heads between static and dynamic features. The authors also come up with a specific regularization scheme at training called \"selective optimization\" relying on masking the lowest quantile of features (or highest depending on the objective) in terms of similarity with the anchor when computing the objective. They evaluate their method on ECG data on tasks specifically relying on static or dynamic features."

                    "value": "Unfortunately, this work presents some major weaknesses which lead me to recommend for rejection. \n\n###  Grossly insufficient related work\nThe literature review effort of the field from the authors is extremely small. \nBetween their introduction and their related work, the authors **only cited four works**. However, the field of SSL for time series is much richer. To cite a few:\n- Franchesci et al. Unsupervised scalable representation learning for multivariate time series NeurIPS, 2019\n- Cheng et al. \"Subject-aware contrastive learning for biosignals\", 2020\n- Mohsenvand  et al. \"Contrastive representation learning for electroencephalogram classification\", Machine Learning for Health, 2020\n- Tonekaboni et al. \"Unsupervised representation learning for time series with temporal neighborhood coding\" ICLR 2020\n- Kiyasseh et al. \"Clocs: Contrastive learning of cardiac signals across space, time, and patients\" ICML, 2021\n- Yeche et al. \"Neighborhood contrastive learning applied to online patient monitoring\" ICML, 2021\n- Eldede et al.  \"Time-series representation learning via temporal and contextual contrasting\", IJCAI, 2021\n- Fan et al. \"Semi-supervised time series classification by temporal relation prediction\" ICASSP, 2021\n\n### Clarity in the method \n\n- The authors don't have a part where they introduce precise notations even though the authors use a lot of different notations. This contributes to making the reading quite complicated and leaves some parts of the method unclear to me.\n\n\n- In addition, the figures don't have descriptive captions. Typically, except for the colors, no description is given for the numerous components of Figure 1. Conversely, in Figures 2 and 3, no explanation is given regarding the coloring scheme.\n\n### Some missing experiments\n\n- The authors use a covariance loss borrowed from VICReg but do not provide ablation for that component. Hence it's impossible to know if performance improvement comes from the disentanglement of the dynamic and static features proposed by the authors or this additional regularization. \n- Similarly, the authors propose to use two projection spaces instead of one because of the adversarial nature of their objectives. Unfortunately, they do not provide an experiment justifying this choice over a unique space.\n- The authors introduce a window parameter for their short-term loss. They don't provide ablation for it."

The new version of the manuscript contains not only a broader view of related work, but also points out what challenges CHRONOS faces and makes it stand out from the rest.\n\n> Regarding the Clarity of the Method.\n\nIn the new version of the manuscript, the first paragraph in page 3, the Figure 1 should give a clearer view of the proposed method, in addition to the notations added bellow each equation should be enough for going throgh the paper.\n\nAn extended version of the captions for each figure has been incorporated to the final version of the manuscript.\n\n> Regarding the missing experiments\n\n1. The required ablation study as been included in the Section 5.\n2. We inherit the proposed configuration from DEBS study.\n3. We inherit the proposed configuration from DEBS study.\n\n>  Why report specificity and sensitivity and not AUROC directly? Using AUROC prevents the performance from being biased by potential miscalibration of a model.\n\nAt the time of evaluation we consider that the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity together demonstrate sufficient statistical value to compare different methods. \n\n> What is the meaning of the colored bars in Figures 2 and 3?\n\nThey represent the features that are included in the set of the most important features for the respective tasks. It is reflected now in the captions of each figure.\n\n> Why carry constants in your loss terms that will have no impact on gradient? \"1 + \" or \"1 -\"\n\nThe different loss terms consist of the Cosine Similarity between pairs of representations. This metric has values within a range of (-1, 1). These constants (1 + or 1 -) are added for keeping the loss values in a strictly positive range. It is a common practise when the Cosine Similarity is used.\n\n**We would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this rebuttal. We hope that the explanations given are sufficient to change your opinion of the work presented.**"

However, the proposed model only learns two types of representations, static and short-term. \n\n- The description of the proposed method lacks clarity.

For example, why two different records are used and why projection and prediction are compared while not both projections in Eq. (2). What are i and j in Eq. (3)? Hyperparameters? How were they determined?\n\n- It seems to me that the proposed set of loss functions is problematic, leading to representation that has no discriminative capability across recordings. Eq (2) and Eq (3) drive similarity only and Eq (5) only encourages difference in learned dynamic and static features. What really helping here may be the covariance loss function (Eq. (6)), which needs more explanation and deserves an ablation study.  \n\n- The empirical results are relatively weak across the board.

The authors described two distinct spaces...\n\n1. The name of the Dynamic space has been changed to short-term dynamic space in the new version of the manuscript. It should give more insights about the method.\n2. The inner product is not calculated between the projection in the two spaces but using the predictor of the student network instead. \tThis predictor can be seen as a bridge between the two spaces.\n3. We do not know what you mean by only learning two types of representations. \n- 3a  Although it has no projection of its own, Long-Term Dynamic Loss leads the model to represent such dynamics. This is calculated between the representation of two different inputs from two different records which are delayed one from the other with a sufficient temporal gap. This loss function is motivated precisely to drive the model to capture the Long Term Dynamics. \n- 3b If you mention it for the experiments developed in section 4.2, where we have not included any that directly concerns the long-term dynamics, we believe that the mere presence of the most important feature for AFib Classification, as part of the set of static features (Section 4.2) as long as the results in the comparison against the other SOTA methods is enough to assess that we are capturing the three natures, as detailed in the discussion of results on the same section.\n\n> The description of the proposed method lacks clarity. For example, what is the relationship between projector and predictor and that between teacher and student networks. The proposed architecture includes encoder(s), projectors, and predictor. What exactly the representation used in downstream prediction task is not clear.\n\nWhen the original manuscript was written, it was thought that referring to the fact that the framework presented in BYOL is used as a base was enough to understand these issues. However, due to this feedback a new paragraph has been added, (last paragraph in section 3.1.1) in which it is detailed that both teacher network and the teacher projectors are updated, using EMA from their respective student pairs. It has also been added that, as is common in SSL methods, the projector and predictor are discarded after the training process. The encoder output is used during the downstream tasks.\n\n> The loss functions are not clearly motivated, ...are compared while not both projections in Eq. (2). What are i and j in Eq. (3)? Hyperparameters? How were they determined?\n\n1. A more detailed description of the motivation of the different loss functions has been provided in the first paragraph of the page 3. This paragraph, in addition with the Figure 1, should provide more insights about the motivation of each Loss Function. The motivation of the L_LTD, which is one of the cores of this paper, is detailed in depth in Section 3.2.1\n\n2. The student network predictions are used instead the projectors in line with the BYOL framework. \n\n3. i and j is the time delay between the different inputs. A line has been added below the equation to reflect this. The three inputs are extracted in a two-minute window, in line with the DEBS modus operandi.\n\n>  It seems to me that the proposed set of loss functions is problematic, ... . Eq (2) and Eq (3) drive similarity only and Eq (5) only encourages .... What really helping ....\n\n1. The required Ablation Study has been incorporated to the new version of the manuscript (Section 5). The covariance loss function by itself does not drives the model to learn useful representations.\n\n2. As mentioned in Section 3.2.1, the Eq(5) (4 in the new version of the manuscripts), serves both for encouraging the two spaces for capturing different features, and at the same time, capturing the long-term dynamics, since it is calculated using representations from different recordings (As Illustrated in Figure 1). It enhances also differences between different recordings.\n\n3. A new paragraph has been added in the Ablation Study explaining that the incorporation of this loss metric between different records improve the performance on the downstream tasks. Additionaly, using it also as a Contrasting Factor between the projectors improve the performance of the whole system.\n\n> The empirical results are relatively weak...\n\nThere was an error in the STD given in the original manuscript for the MAE errors of the Age Regression task. They were 10x larger. We are very grateful that you brought this to our attention and it has been corrected in the original manuscript. We believe that in this way the results have statistical value.\n\n\n**We would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this rebuttal. We hope that the explanations given are sufficient to change your opinion of the work presented.**"

The authors tested their method on four tasks, including gender identification, age regression, AFib Classification, and the Physionet Challenge.

CHRONOS distinguishes itself by projecting data representations into two spaces and optimizing selective model units for each temporal aspect. The method has been evaluated on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal tasks such as arrhythmia detection, gender identification, and age estimation, showing it can surpass existing methods.\n\nKey concepts include the identification of unique static patterns as biometric identifiers, the volatility in short-term dynamics for immediate physiological changes, and the gradual change observed in long-term dynamics related to slow-evolving characteristics like age or cholesterol level. CHRONOS extends the DEBS approach by using three types of loss functions for distinct temporal representations and captures the evolution over significant time gaps, enhancing the ability to understand and utilize physiological signal patterns for diverse health-related analyses."

An expansion of the evaluation to standard baselines like UCR, or the FD-a and FD-b tasks used to evaluate TF-C, could help show the proposed generalization characteristics of this approach with more empirical validation.\n2/ There are a number of existing time-series specific transformer applications. FormerTime (Cheng, et. al., 2023), for example, also focuses on multi-scale time series dynamics for multivariate time series classification, albeit without self-supervised learning. The authors should consider evaluations against these time-series specific transformer models such as Formertime and Informer to see if their proposed method continues to add benefit or if simply updating the encoder they use could lead to improvements across all the tasks evaluated using standard self-supervised learning.\n3/ The figures with feature importance and overlap of features for the static and dynamic cases could benefit for my explication of which features were included (e.g. by including the feature name instead of its number).\n\nNits:\n1/ All the references are improperly included in the text.

                        "value": "First of all, we would like to thank you for taking the time to read the manuscript and write the revisions.\n\nWe would like to clarify the following with regard to the weaknesses mentioned above:\n\n> The authors frame the work as generalizing to other applications besides medical ECG however it seems most of the motivation for the design of CHRONOS is very grounded in the specifics of ECG datasets and the provided tasks with references to medical-specific features, model selection, and dataset characteristics. An expansion of the evaluation to standard baselines like UCR, or the FD-a and FD-b tasks used to evaluate TF-C, could help show the proposed generalization characteristics of this approach with more empirical validation.\n\nWe believe that there has been a potential confusion in the statement that CHRONOS may be generalizable to other types of time series data, especially for other types of physiological signals. This statement is motivated by the fact that all these signals share the three dynamics detailed in this study, and no technique (i.e., data augmentation) specific to ECG signals is used. This is why we are invited to think that a model can be optimized using CHRONOS to understand other types of data, using another dataset. However, we do not assure that the model optimized using ECG signals will be able to perform on other types of signals directly. We are sorry for the confusion and sections 6 has been modified to avoid this problem of understanding.\n\n> There are a number of existing time-series specific transformer applications. FormerTime (Cheng, et. al., 2023), for example, also focuses on multi-scale time series dynamics for multivariate time series classification, albeit without self-supervised learning. The authors should consider evaluations against these time-series specific transformer models such as Formertime and Informer to see if their proposed method continues to add benefit or if simply updating the encoder they use could lead to improvements across all the tasks evaluated using standard self-supervised learning.\n\nThis paper shows a new SSL method for optimizing a DL model. It means that what it is evaluated here is how SSL different methods make the same model to understand better a specific kind of data. SSL methods are evaluated on generic DL models, commonly using ResNet or ViT (as this paper). It can be supposed that the application of the presented method to a specific architecture tailored to a particular kind of data can lead to a better performance. However, the model architecture is not a topic for this paper.\n\n> The figures with feature importance and overlap of features for the static and dynamic cases could benefit for my explication of which features were included (e.g. by including the feature name instead of its number).\n\nThe features you refer to compose a vector of dimension 128, which is the output of the encoder (the model being optimized). There are no names to provide further insight into what they represent. That is why their position in this representation is used during this study.\n\n> All the references are improperly included in the text. I believe you should change from using citet to citep in most cases. References should include the author names in the sentence (e.g. \u201cAdditionally a SHAP Analysis as proposed by Lundberg & Lee (2017) is carried out\u201d) or by including the author names in the citation (e.g. \u201cAdditionally a SHAP Analysis (Lundberg & Lee, 2017)...\u201d). Please read the \u201cCitations in Text\u201d part of the provided LaTeX template for more information.\n\nWe agree on this point, the relevant changes have been made in the new version of the manuscript, which you can see since it has been uploaded.\n\n> About the questions you have asked, we have the following responses\n\n1. We would like to thank you for this point, as there was an error in Table 4 in the original manuscript. Obviously when L_LTD is not taken into account, the split ratio is 50/50 over the other two. Regarding the second point and increasing the L_LTD ratio, in this same table (last row) the experiment you request has been carried out, showing that it does not improve the proposed configuration.\n\n2. We have not considered this option, but our thinking is that it would confuse rather than help the optimization process.\n\n3. We use SHHS since it contains two records belonging to the same subject, and these records are delayed with a sufficient temporal gap (around 4 years) to let these long-term dynamics changes to appear. This makes this specific database special, and this is the reason that it has been the only database used during the optimization. This explanation has been added to the Appendix (See Appendix B)\n\n**We would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to read this rebuttal. We hope that the explanations given are sufficient to change your opinion of the work presented.**"

I appreciate the time given to correcting the errors in the original manuscript and updating to use correct formatting and presentation. I believe this has improved its readability somewhat and is more in line with the official submission guidelines.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the changes made to the manuscript, I will be maintaining my score due to the following:\n1. While I appreciate the clarification on what parts of the paper are original work vs included as a reference to the work on DEBS I believe this reduces the novelty and value added by this work. It would make sense to spend more time developing a method that can generalize to a broader array of applications and is not so constrained to the specific area of ECG and even only seems to work on the provided database.\n2. I agree with the points of reviewer DudA that the additional ablation study does not make a strong case for CHRONOS as a stand-alone method. I believe the work done in this paper can be helpful in highlighting some of the open questions in this area but requires additional development to be accepted."
