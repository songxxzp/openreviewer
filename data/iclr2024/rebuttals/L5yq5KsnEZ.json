Specifically, it's not evident how the concepts of 'bias amplification' and 'bias suppression' are factored into the design of the reweighting scheme.\n- While the paper did assess performance against various distillation methods, I believe it would be beneficial to include other reweighting algorithms as baselines for a more comprehensive comparison (e.g., to justify the choice of KDE and Supervised Contrastive Learning for distance computation)."

The distillation performance on biased datasets across all scenarios, ranging from No distillation to MTT, appears to be quite similar. The observed differences seem to be primarily driven by the performance on unbiased datasets. It appears that the term 'bias suppression' may be overstated or overclaimed in this context.

However, they only test this strategy by combining with mere two earlier arts including distribution and gradient matching methods, providing insufficient evidence to prove the generalization ability and thus limiting the reliability.  \n\nW2: The method proposed in this paper seems to excel only on very simple datasets with sufficiently significant biases (e.g., CMNIST and BG FMNIST). On more complex datasets that lack remarkable biases (e.g., Corrupted CIFAR-10), the performance appears to be modest. This raises concerns about the practicality and robustness of the proposed reweighting scheme.\n\nW3: The concerns raised in W2 lead me to question the necessity of addressing biases during the dataset distillation process. I posit that the performance ceiling of such reweighting mechanisms is inherently constrained by the number of unbiased samples in the original dataset. For instance, in simple datasets with strong biases, like CMNIST and BG FMNIST, distilled data can extract ample features from a limited pool of unbiased samples. However, for more intricate datasets where biases are not as pronounced, such as Corrupted CIFAR-10, it is unsurprising that this reweighting scheme falls short. This limitation stems from its inability to effectively harness the features present in biased samples. \n\nGiven this analysis, from my perspective, wouldn't a logical progression be to first create an unbiased dataset using methods like DFA or SelectMix, followed by dataset distillation?"

Will the proposed scheme also be effective for MTT?\n\nQ2: In your ablation study shown in Section 6, you tried to use SelectMix directly on the crafted synthetic dataset. Based on W3, I am curious about the performances if you first use SelectMix to construct an unbiased dataset and then synthesize the distilled dataset."
