In practice, the proposed algorithm is shown to achieve higher sample efficiency than DQN with $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration."

                        "value": "Thank you for allocating your time to prepare a response for our paper.\n\n**1.** *\u201dLack of explanation: Why would a higher TD error help exploration and speed up training in general? I don't see a clear connection between them. I believe that it is very important to explain the logic behind.\u201d*\n\nThe TD error is the loss function used in Q-learning i.e. the goal is to minimize the TD error over all state transitions. By focusing on state transitions where the TD error is higher, larger updates can be made to the Q-function, resulting in faster learning. To give an extreme example, if the TD error for a transition is zero, then the gradient of the loss is zero, and using that transition to make an update results in zero change to the Q-function (i.e. zero learning).\n\n**2.** *\u201dIn Section 4, $\\epsilon$ is chosen from [0.15,0.25]. In practice, a smaller $\\epsilon$ is usually used. How is the performance of the algorithms with smaller $\\epsilon$, such as [0.01,0.05]? How sensitive is MaxMin TD learning to compared to DQN?\u201c*\n\nWe now added a new section in the supplementary material regarding your question. The results demonstrate that MaxMin TD learning also performs substantially better with $\\epsilon= [0.01,0.05]$ as you suggested. Please see supplementary material.\n\n**3.** *\u201cHow large is $\\mathcal{D}(s)$, $\\delta$ and$\\eta$ in practice? Is $\\mathcal{D}(s)-2 \\delta -\\eta positive or negative in practice?\u201d*\n\nIn practice $\\mathcal{D}(s) - 2\\delta -\\eta$ is positive as demonstrated by our empirical results on the temporal difference error of MaxMin TD learning versus the $\\epsilon$-greedy in Figure 3 and Figure 6. In particular, the higher TD values for MaxMin TD learning demonstrate that this quantity is indeed positive in practice.\n\n\n**4.** *\u201cIn Section 3, it is claimed that, in the early phase of the training, in expectation over the random initialization $\\theta \\in \\Theta$, the TD error is higher when taking the minimum value action than that of a random action. However, this contradicts the experimental results shown in Figure 3, especially Figure 3(a).\u201c*\n\nPlease see Figure 6. Figure 6 reports results **across all** the games in the entire Atari benchmark. The results reported in Figure 6 indeed demonstrate that TD error is higher when taking the minimum value action than that of a random action.\n\n\n**5.** *\u201dIn Section 4, it is mentioned that the maximum achievable reward in 100 steps is 10. However, the learning curve in Figure 1 (b) is above 10 in the end. How do you get the data used in Figure 1?\u201d*\n\nThank you for pointing out the typo in the text. The maximum achievable reward in 100 steps is 11. This is due to the fact that the action that transitions the agent to state 3 can be used in state 1 to skip state 2. Thus, the optimal policy in fact can traverse the whole chain in 9 steps.\n\n**6.** *\u201dIn Definition 3.2 & 3.5: What is $\\hat{a}(s,\\theta)$?*\n\n$\\hat{a}(s,\\theta)$ is any arbitrary action chosen as a function of $s$ and $\\theta$. The notation emphasizes the fact that the action choice may depend on both $s$ the current state, and $\\theta$ the parameters of the Q-function. That is, we require that the conditions of the definitions hold no matter what action $\\hat{a}(s,\\theta)$ is chosen as a function of $s$ and $\\theta$."

Most of my concerns still remain.\n\n1. *The TD error is the loss function used in Q-learning i.e. the goal is to minimize the TD error over all state transitions. By focusing on state transitions where the TD error is higher, larger updates can be made to the Q-function, resulting in faster learning.*\n\nI do agree that larger TD errors could lead to larger Q-function updates. However, this does not directly connect with better exploration. More explanations or experimental results are needed to support this.\n\n2. *New experiments for $\\epsilon \\in [0.01, 0.05]$ in the supplementary material.*\n\nI appreciate the new experiments. However, the results are for $\\epsilon \\in [0.001, 0.005]$, not exactly what I asked for.\n\n3. *In practice $\\mathcal{D}(s) \u2212 2\\delta \u2212 \\eta$ is positive as demonstrated by our empirical results on the temporal difference error of MaxMin TD learning versus the -greedy in Figure 3 and Figure 6.*\n\nI disagree. What are shown in Figure 3&6 are TD errors, not $\\mathcal{D}(s) \u2212 2\\delta \u2212 \\eta$.\n\n4. *The results reported in Figure 6 indeed demonstrate that TD error is higher when taking the minimum value action than that of a random action.*\n\nThis still does not explain the contradictions between the experimental results in Figure 3 and the theory."

Merely referring to a paper\u2019s results is not sufficient. Please elaborate on QRDQN. Is it a model-based algorithm?

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- The theoretical contribution of this paper relies on several strong assumptions: (1) expected rewards for a uniform random policy and the $a_{min}$ is $\\eta$-uniformed; (2) the Q-value for consequent states $s$ and $s'$ has little difference ($\\delta$-smooth); (3) the initialized Q-function results in a policy that is close to uniform random. The main theoretical conclusion that the TD achieved by $a_{min}$ is above-average by an amount approximately equal to the disadvantage gap ($D(s)$) would be wrong if $\\delta$ and $\\eta$ are not close to 0, because the gap actually equals to $D(s) - 2\\delta - \\eta$. Also, based on my experience, for value functions parameterized by deep neural nets, the initial policy distribution characterized by the initialized Q-functions is often fairly biased from a uniform distribution. In practice, the value $\\epsilon$ would need to gradually decay during the initial phase of training, which means that in practice the theoretically derived conclusion will quickly be invalid in a real training regime. \n\n- In the proposed Algorithm 1, the RL agent always takes $a_{min}$ for exploration action, and no action with intermediate Q-values could be taken for exploration. Unless $a_{min}$ would keep changing among the action set throughout the training, I think the proposed method would easily result in sub-optimal policy compared to $\\epsilon$-greedy due to the limited exploration strategy.  For exploration, I'm not convinced it would be generally beneficial to always take a_{min}, and in practice, a_{min} is not guaranteed to always lead to the largest TD error. Though the authors attempt to claim their proposed method is better than UCB through the simple motivating task on chain MDP, I'm still not convinced that the MaxMin TD Learning could generally beat the strong UCB policy variants when tackling challenging RL domains like Atari 2600. \n\n- I think the empirical results on the motivating example are flawed. The authors show the learning curves of MaxMin TD, $\\epsilon$-greedy, and UCB, but it is unclear how the exploration policies for the two baselines are specified. For $\\epsilon$-greedy, it seems that the authors fix the $\\epsilon$ value, otherwise, I expect a well-tuned $\\epsilon$-greedy with $\\epsilon$ decay properly defined will succeed in the simple chain MDP. It is suspicious why $\\epsilon$-greedy converges to a sub-optimal average return. I also wonder if MaxMin TD learning can learn properly without $\\epsilon$ decay. It is unfair if the authors allow MaxMin to employ a decayed $\\epsilon$, while keeping that for $\\epsilon$ or UCB fixed. Please specify the details of each policy.\n\n- For the large-scale Atari 100K evaluation, the baselines are insufficient. As the algorithm focuses on exploration policy, at least it should compare with the UCB-variant of baselines. Also, neither noisy networks nor $\\epsilon$-greedy is the SOTA method on Atari 100K. The authors should employ stronger baselines. \n\n- The learning curves for the noisy net are missing in the Atari 100K figures (e.g., Fig 2 and Fig 4). They should be added at least to each game's learning curve.  \n\n- It would be more convincing if the authors could evaluate MaxMin TD Learning on a more inclusive range of tasks, e.g., Atari 2600 and mujoco, where the method could work on top of both value-based and policy-based algorithms to verify its generality."

As the algorithm focuses on exploration policy, at least it should compare with the UCB-variant of baselines. Also, neither noisy networks nor $\\epsilon$-greedy is the SOTA method on Atari 100K. The authors should employ stronger baselines.\u201d*\n\nMaxMin TD Learning is a zero-cost algorithm to boost TD learning. Note that $\\epsilon$-greedy is currently the main method used in deep reinforcement learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness [1,2,3,4,5]. Even **the best performing algorithm in Atari 100K** that was quite recently published in ICML 2023 [5] is indeed using $\\epsilon$-greedy. Nonetheless, although MaxMin TD learning is a zero-cost technique we still further provided comparisons against more expensive baseline techniques such as NoisyNetworks.\n\n[1] Human-level Atari 200x faster, ICLR 2023. \n\n[2] Bootstrapped Meta-Learning, ICLR 2022.

Furthermore, currently our paper already reports results both in Atari 100K and Atari 2600. These results are reported in Figure 2, Figure 5 and Figure 4 respectively.\n\n[1] Human-level Atari 200x faster, ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] Distributional Reinforcement Learning with Quantile Regression, AAAI 2018.\n\n[3] Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning, AAAI 2016.\n\n[4] Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning, ICML 2016.\n\n[5] Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice, NeurIPS 2021.

These results indeed demonstrate that MaxMin TD learning **does not** result in a sub-optimal policy compared to $\\epsilon$-greedy."
