                    "value": "This work studies multi-source black-box domain adaptation where the user adapts multiple source models (parameters unaccessible) to a shifted target domain. In particular, the authors first modify the classical triangle inequality in multiple source domain adaptation by relating the upper bound with the best source model. Then, the authors propose to divide the label space by concentration and closeness. Thereafter, they introduce a pseudo-label refinement network via cross-attention between prediction and the original source labels. Experimental results show that the proposed method obtains better performance than the baselines."

In fact, I don't think this can be easily fixed during the rebuttal phase.\n\n2. First, the author mentioned that existing BDA methods suffer from 'decrease empirical errors e.g. through de-noising of source predictions and label smoothing when yT is not accessible'. But, in the modified triangle inequality, there is still a term of p_c, whose definition requires the ground truth. \n\n3. I don't quite understand how p_c can be properly obtained. It seems this paper attempts to obtain p_c via the concentration of one source's predictions to those of other sources. What if there is only one best source while the other sources are all terrible? Also, Section 3.3 is confusing. Why the label space should be divided?\n\n4. The proposed label refine network also confused me. Is the network architecture derived according to the theorem? I don't think such a complex network in the label space can improve the performance.\n\n5. The final prediction performance improvement is marginal. Also, a recent SOTA paper is missing - https://openreview.net/forum?id=hVrXUps3LFA"

Section 3.3 is where these problems are prominently reflected\uff1aThe paper uses 'i' to represent the i-th source model, but the definition of the set 'I' is not provided (it's also not included in the appendix). Furthermore, the definition of the set 'Ic' is not standardized. In this context, I understand 'Ic' to represent the set of indexes of source models predicted as label 'c'\uff0cthe value of 'jc*' should be 'c', and it's possible that some of the symbol definitions are redundant or unnecessary. Additionally, there might be an issue with the definition of 'j''. Furthermore, when the cardinality of 'Ic' is 'M', there is another possible scenario where all source models have identical predictions. The paper does not explicitly mention this, which is a lack of rigor. The definition of 'P' as a set is provided in the appendix, but it lacks standardization.\n\uff082\uff09In Section 4.2 of this paper, where the comparison with other SOTA methods is presented, only results are provided, and there is a lack of analysis.\n\uff083\uff09This paper lacks certain essential details. For instance, it mentions the use of dropout in the model but does not specify the dropout probability.
