                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback and for acknowledging that our approach achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art method.\n\n__Higher resolution__\n\nPrevious work on hierarchical representations has shown promising results for GNNs when extending to higher resolution meshes. Our work focuses on an orthogonal question, i.e. how to extend MeshGraphNets from isotropic materials to anisotropic materials? While our solution to this question would likely benefit from them, hierarchical representations alone cannot help with anisotropy. \n\n__Comparison to HOOD__\n\nHOOD employs MeshGraphNets in a cloth simulation setting, incorporating a hierarchical representation for accelerating information propagation during message passing. In the absence of a hierarchical structure, their network closely resembles MeshGraphNets and is thus limited to isotropic materials. Our approach, on the other hand, extends MeshGraphNets to anisotropic material.\n\n__GAT__\n\nAlthough attention mechanisms might offer some assistance, our approach introduces a simpler yet highly effective strategy. While attention masks must be learned during training, our method only requires no extra mechanism. Our modifications incur minimal additional cost for integrating into an existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture.\n\n__Questions__\n\nYes \u201c5 rollouts\u201d means using the model to autoregressively predict 5 steps. This plot is meant to show that the network is stable for longer rollouts. We will include animations in the supplementary video for the final version.\n\nWe hope these answers provide sufficient reasons to raise the score. Otherwise, please let us know what are the remaining questions that are holding you back."

                    "value": "Most of my concerns are reflected in the questions section below.\n\n**Novelty and contributions**\nThe scope of the problem setup is narrow (anisotropic hyperelastic material without considering plasticity, contact, or collision). Therefore, I expect an in-depth study of this problem to justify its publication. This can include deep insight into anisotropic materials, comparisons with strong and fine-tuned baselines, comprehensive analysis of its generalizability, or demonstrating its exciting downstream applications with anisotropic materials.\n\n**Methods**\nThe notations in the technical methods are confusing, and I feel it would be challenging for people lacking deformable solid simulation background to understand and reproduce this paper. I left a number of specific questions in the \u201cQuestions\u201d section below.\n\n**Experiments**\n- I feel the problem size is too small to conduct meaningful analysis on GNNs. 60-120 elements (the training problem size) are considered very few for deformable solid simulation and can be solved quickly and accurately with numerical methods. The \u201cDeformablePlate\u201d in MeshGraphNet contains ~1200 nodes (so >= 300 tetrahedrons, with contact/collision handling). A modern, GPU-based numerical simulator can probably scale this up even more without losing speed or accuracy if no contact/collision needs to be solved, which seems to be the setup of this paper. I do agree with the intro that learning-based approaches can \u201cstrike a balance between accuracy and efficiency,\u201d but such a tradeoff doesn\u2019t need to exist for very small problems.\n\n- Baselines: The performance of the baseline seems much worse than what the original MeshGraphNet paper reported. A concrete example is Fig. 6: if MeshGraphNet caused 60% volume change, their \u201cDeformablePlate\u201d example would have exhibited very obvious artifacts. I wonder whether the variational loss + MeshGraphNet combination negatively influenced its performance, but I am not sure. Also, following my first point, I feel the paper lacks a crucial comparison to the reference simulator in terms of speed and accuracy.\n\n- I also feel the study on the method\u2019s generalizability is limited. Having more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations other than horizontal and vertical ones would be more convincing. Testing it on more realistic hyperelastic materials (e.g., Neohookean or corotated) would be useful as well."
                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "**Technical questions about the network design**\n- I suspect \u201cf^{v->e}\u201d in \u201cvertex processing\u201d of Figure 2 should be replaced with \u201cf^{e->v}\u201d.\n- I don\u2019t quite follow why fiber orientation is an edge feature. It seems more reasonable to consider fiber orientation as a (finite) element feature if there is such a thing in the network module. The reason why I have this feeling is that F, the deformation gradient, is typically an element quantity in linear tetrahedron finite elements, and Eqn. (6) indicates that it\u2019s convenient to consider d as an element quantity as well.\n- Could you clarify the notation \u201cE_j\u201d in Eqn. (4)?\n- How are E_x, E_y, E_z in Eqn. (4) defined? I am guessing that one of them is d and the other two are orthogonal to d, but I am not quite sure.\n- I am not sure I get the intuition behind explicitly formulating three weighted sums of e_j in  Eqn. (3). Part of me wonders whether it is truly necessary, as the directional information d is already provided in the edge feature. I can accept that doing so does not hurt, but it would be nice if the authors could provide more insights into this design decision. This seems crucial for the paper\u2019s technical contribution, so I want to make sure I fully understand it.\n\n**About the loss function**\n- Eqn. (5): Is x^{t+1} computed from a^{t+1} or is it an independent variable? I am guessing that the network produces a^{t+1}, which is then used to compute x^{t+1}, and both a^{t+1} and x^{t+1} are fed into this loss function.\n- Eqn. (6): I understand that the text already mentioned that the loss function sums up per-element potentials, but I\u2019d still appreciate a more rigorous writing of the strain energy, i.e., adding a proper sum over all finite elements and defining how F is computed from x^{t+1} (e.g., by citing 16 or similar literature). Echoing my question above, I\u2019d also like to understand how dFFd is computed in a single element.\n- While I appreciate the choice of using the incremental potential as the loss function L, I feel there are some subtleties after incorporating the network. Let x be the new position and theta be the network parameters. A stationary point of min_x L(x) nicely solves implicit Euler integration because L is its variational form, but a stationary point of min_theta L(x(theta)) only satisfies dL/dtheta = dL/dx * dx/dtheta = 0. From a theoretical perspective, whether this guarantees dL/dx = 0 (the true solution to the implicit Euler integration) is not obvious to me.\n\n**About network training**\n- Could you elaborate on how the fiber orientations are uniformly sampled in each element? Also, is each element assigned an independently sampled direction? The results seem to contain only horizontal and vertical directions shared by all anisotropic elements.\n\n**About the \u201cConvergence\u201d experiment**\n- Is Fig. 3 displaying the training loss or its difference from the ground truth incremental potential solved by the reference simulation?\n- I suggest adding another figure that directly visualizes the difference between the network-predicted x^{t+1} and the reference x^{t+1} from the numerical simulator.\n- Fig. 4: Why is the \u201ctotal\u201d energy difference lower than the \u201cfiber\u201d term difference?\n- For both Figs. 3 and 4, I am not sure whether the worse performance of MeshGraphNet should be attributed to the network lacking the direction-aware message-passing mechanism or the decision to use the new loss function in MeshGraphNet.\n\n**About the \u201cVolume Preservation\u201d experiment**\n- A minor comment is that Poisson\u2019s ratio = 0.48 does not mean zero volume change. It would be informative to add a third curve in Fig. 6 showing the volume change from the reference simulator.\n\n**About the \u201cTip Displacement\u201d experiment**\n- I am trying to understand the significance of the \u201cTip Displacement Error.\u201d What is the average size of the finite elements in these scenes?\n- Also, how many elements does a test scene typically have?\n\n**About the \u201cImbalanced Forces\u201d experiment**\n- I like this experiment more than the others, but again, what is the size of the finite elements? Without knowing it, I was having a difficult time calibrating the \u201cForce Density\u201d column and the \u201cImbalanced Force\u201d column in Table 2.\n\n**About the \u201cGeneralization\u201d experiment**\n- I didn\u2019t find quantitative data about this experiment. In particular, how different is it from the deformed shape computed from the reference simulator?\n- I am curious to see the generalization to more diverse, spatially varying fiber orientations."

                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback. \n\n__Unsupervised training for MeshGraphNets__ \n\nTo test whether the sub-par performance of MeshGraphNets might be due to our unsupervised learning approach (the original work used supervised training), we trained MeshGraphNets with only isotropic material using unsupervised learning.\nWe observe that MeshGraphNets performs significantly better for isotropic materials - see results in this anonymous [link](https://i.postimg.cc/xTFRWRyf/image-259.png). These results suggest that the sub-par performance of MeshGraphNets for anisotropic materials is indeed due to its inability to capture anisotropic behavior, not to the way in which it is trained. \n\n\n__Contact and higher resolution__\n\nWe refer to the [Contact, higher resolution, complex scene] response to R2-r4js\nRegarding performance gains, we reported in the training paragraph of section 3.3 that the inference of our network on a mesh of 100 elements takes only 9ms. The same examples are around 10 to 20 times slower in our reference FEM simulation. MeshGraphNet reports two to three orders of magnitude performance gain over the reference FEM solver solver. Since our network architecture and hyperparameters follow MeshGraphNet, we expect the same performance when scaling to higher resolutions.\n\n__NeoHookean & Corotated__\n\nWe agree that NeoHookean and the corotated constitutive models are viable options. However, these models are still isotropic and would need to be augmented with stiffening fibers in the same way as we do with our StVK-based material. Although we believe that our method readily extends to different isotropic base materials (NeoHookean, Mooney-Rivlin, etc.), our focus is on anisotropy and we therefore opted for a simple StVK model.\n\n__Technical Question__ \n\nWe generally think of fiber directions as continuous vector fields. These fields can be sampled at vertices, edge midpoints, or element centroids. One representation could be converted into any other using simple interpolation. We agree that fiber orientation could be an element feature, but we chose the edge representation for simplicity (edges and vertices are modeled in the MeshGraphNets graphs whereas elements are not). \n\nE_j denotes an edge in the undeformed configuration, i.e. E_j = x_k - x_l, where x_k and x_l are mesh vertices. E_x, E_y, E_z are Cartesian basis vectors, [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] and [0, 0, 1]. These basis vectors are decoupled from fiber orientations, which are randomly oriented during training and are in general not aligned with E_x, E_y, and E_z. We opt for this projection operation to decouple information in different directions. As can be seen in all our experiments, we observe significant performance gains with this approach.\n\nWe will fix the typo in Figure 2. \n\n\n__Loss function__\nThanks for pointing these out. Yes, x^{t+1} should be a function of a^{t+1}. Computing deformation gradient follows standard finite element theory for linear tetrahedral elements. We will include the computation in the supplementary material. The first-order optimality condition with the network in the loop is indeed that the gradient w.r.t. network weights should be zero. We will clarify this in our final version.\n\n__Volume Change__\n\nWe agree that a Poisson ratio of 0.48 does not imply volume preservation, which is why we are plotting the relative percentage error with respect to the ground truth simulation. This description is indeed in the caption but we are happy to make it clearer.\n\n__Fiber directions__\n\nDifferent fiber orientations are evaluated in Table 2 when examining force imbalance. In the remaining examples, we specifically opt for fiber directions aligned with and orthogonal to the applied forces to highlight their effects. Aligning the deformations with fibers in these directions is more intuitive for readers than scenarios involving randomly oriented fibers. We consider homogeneous fibers, i.e. same fiber directions for all elements,  with directions and magnitude randomly sampled during training. \n\n__Convergence__\n\nFig.3 displays the difference between the network predictions on the test set and the ground truth simulation, i.e. test loss normalized by ground truth value.\n\nThe energy corresponding to the external force load can be negative. Therefore, the total energy difference can be smaller than the fiber energy difference.\n\n__Element Size__ \n\nThe cantilever beam mesh has dimensions  0.1m * 0.1m * 0.5m, resulting in a total volume of 0.005m^3. If we distribute 100 elements within the bar, each element, on average, would have a volume of 50 cm^3 and an average edge length of approximately 7.5cm.\n\nIf these answers are satisfying to you, please consider raising your score. Otherwise, we are more than happy to elaborate on other questions."

The primary contribution is the addition of directional encodings in the message-passing GNN, such that during updates of the vertex embeddings, the corresponding incident edge features are _weighted by directional edge weights_ prior to being concatenated.  This allows the network to additionally learn anisotropic deformation.  They also devise a self-supervised loss function based on the variational formulation of the physical laws governing the simulation.  They present comparisons with MeshGraphNets, and a ground truth FEM simulator.  Their method allows the graph networks to more faithfully learn anisotropic dynamics."

We argue that, rather than a disadvantage,  algorithms that combine simplicity and effectiveness are highly desirable.\n\n__Contact and higher resolution__\n\nWe agree that higher-resolution simulations with intricate contacts are an exciting direction to pursue. However, our contribution is orthogonal to these aspects. We aim to extend MeshGraphNets from isotropic to anisotropic materials. \n\n\n__Material Space Basis__\n\n We apologize for the confusion about the material space basis, we opt for this term to denote a coordinate system in the undeformed (i.e., material) configuration of the object. In our implementation, we simply use the canonical bases, i.e. unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions. The edge vectors in the undeformed configuration are projected onto these basis vectors by simply selecting the x, y, and z components. \n\nIf these answers are satisfying to you, please consider raising your score.

Especially given the simplicity of the proposed method (which I agree can absolutely be a good thing), it is therefore even more important to show its generalization capability and robustness in order to be fully convincing to a general audience, beyond the narrow scope of the prior work MeshGraphNets.\n\nAs for the material space bases, this makes sense.  In my opinion, this section could have been more clearly explained in the paper, or perhaps illustrated with a small diagram, since this is at the heart of one of the key contributions of the paper.  I had one additional question regarding this: is this weighting scheme robust to rigid transformations of the undeformed configuration, and particularly at inference time?  For example, suppose at inference time, a mesh training sample were to be rotated by 90 degrees around an axis, changing the weights for a particular edge from [1, 0, 0] to [0, 0, 1], then input to the simulator.  Would the learned simulator produce a rotation-equivariant result?\n\nI maintain my original score."

                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback.\n\n\n__Potential Misunderstanding in the Question section__\n\nWe did not include any supplemental material or an appendix including AGILE3D. We understand that many reviewers are managing lots of submissions - is there perhaps a confusion? Did you mean to pass on other feedback? \n\n__Related Work__\n\nThanks for pointing out these related works. After close examination, we notice that the first two works do not use Graph Neural Networks, despite the occurrence of  \u201cgraph-based\u201d in the title of the first one. The third paper does not involve constitutive modeling or machine learning. It appears to us that these works do not have an immediate relationship to our method. Please let us know if we misunderstood. \n\t\n__Weights__\n\nThese energy terms do not conflict with each other. Rather, they describe the total mechanical energy of the physical system. Minimizing the energy in its current form amounts to finding the equilibrium configuration of the system. Although each term involves different physical parameters (Young\u2019s modulus, Poisson\u2019s ratio, mass density, etc), re-scaling individual terms by arbitrary weights would mean breaking the physics.\n\n__Number of Message-passing Steps__\nImproving the learned behavior by increasing the number of message-passing steps is possible, but it comes with a trade-off\u2014more network parameters may result in longer training times and a higher likelihood of encountering local minima. Following MeshGraphNets, we opt for 15 message-passing steps to strike a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n\n__Baseline__\n\nWhile we only compare to one GNN-based baseline, this baseline is nonetheless state-of-the-art. Follow-up works such as HOOD [Grigoriev2023] introduce various improvements, but these extensions do not address the problem we target with our work \u2013 the inherent limitations of MeshGraphNets when modeling anisotropic materials.\n\n__Complex Structure__\nWe refer to the [Contact, higher resolution, complex scene] response to R2-r4js\n\n__Real experiments__\n\nOur goal in this work is to overcome a key limitation in state-of-the-art GNN-based methods, and our results suggest that our method can learn anisotropic material behavior whereas MeshGraphNets cannot. While closing the sim-to-real gap with real experiments is an interesting direction for future work, it is orthogonal to our core contribution. \n\n__Run-time__\n\nWe reported in the training paragraph of section 3.3 that the inference of our network on a mesh of 100 elements takes only 9ms. The same examples are around 10 to 20 times slower in our reference FEM simulation. MeshGraphNets reports two to three orders of magnitude performance gain over the reference FEM solver solver. Since our network architecture and hyperparameters follow MeshGraphNet, we expect the same performance when scaling to higher resolutions."
