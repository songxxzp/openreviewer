Among other things, the authors show 1) that qk normalization enables higher LR, 2) that the z-loss enables higher LR 3) LR warmup makes the model less LR sensitive, 4) Independently parametrizing WD and LR makes the model less LR sensitive, 5) model LR sensitivity grows faster with depth than width."

Moreover, we believe that establishing small-scale models as reliable proxies is a useful new development which opens the door for further research on understanding/mitigating instabilities.. For instance, future research could confirm the hypothesis in Section 3.1.1, which is that large attention logits result from quadratic dependence on parameter norms\n\n> Section 3.3 reads a little anecdotal to me.

The optimal loss scales with model size, so the delta in eval loss between models of different scales are not really comparable.\n\nThank you for this interesting suggestion. We usually observe that LR sensitivity increases with scale. If we understand correctly, normalizing would only exaggerate this effect, because it would amplify differences at lower loss values?\n\n> Will the code be open sourced?\n\nWe believe that the important parts of the code we use are open source, and draw attention to them here: 1) qk-layernorm is implemented as part of MultiHeadDotProductAttention in Flax https://github.com/google/flax/blob/70214f4ecee59fdd82c07b692d4ad3d47149fe3d/flax/linen/attention.py#L438-L442, 2) z-loss is implemented as part of t5x: https://github.com/google-research/t5x/blob/main/t5x/losses.py#L53-L56."

A small increase in loss for a large model might correspond to the model performing like a model at half its parameter size. For a small model with larger loss, a small increase in loss might just correspond to the model performing like a model with 90% of the parameter count. But taking this into account would probably just make the definition more complicated."

This may be a valid point, although it is not very how to mitigate this problem, and it is hard to be completely convinced that this is *the* reason for instability of large transformers. That being said, some of the experiments are valuable and help us a little bit to understand some issues that may arise in the training of transformers. There is an emphasis on considering the learning rate size. \n\nThe suggested experimental evidence supporting this claim is \"val loss vs learning rate\" curves. However, (1) there is no surprise in training divergence when lr becomes too large, and (2) I do not see any experimental evidence that divergence is indeed caused by the considered instabilities and not by something else.\n\nThe paper also studies how \"learning rate sensitivity\" is affected by certain design choices. Learning rate sensitivity is defined as the average of \"excess val loss\" over learning rate range. However, the choice of particularly this metric does not seem well-motivated. Do authors use uniform distribution over lr? If yes, why not uniform over log(lr)? Why not simply use maximal stable lr?\n\nOne insight which seems useful is that default eps=1e-8 in AdamW might appear too large and cause updates to vanish."

                        "value": "We thank you for your comprehensive review, and hope that the following addresses the questions and weaknesses:\n\nIn response to the questions:\n\n> Are we really sure that the reason for large transformers not training well is [attention and output] logit divergence?\n\nWe do not intend to claim that logit divergence is the only reason for large-scale Transformer training instability. However, we are relatively certain that the specific forms of training instability we study in Section 3.1 are caused by logit divergence. There are a few experimental results which support this conclusion:\nIntervening to reduce the attention logit norms via qk-layernorm mitigates instability at high learning rates (Figure 1 and F.1).\nIn Figure 6, all runs which have an attention logit maximum above 10^4 are unstable, while all other runs are stable.\nIntervening to increase the attention logits in small (10M parameter) models at low learning rates deteriorates accuracy (Appendix E).\nIntervening to reduce the divergence of the output logits via z-loss mitigates instability at high learning rates (Figure 2 and F.2).\n\n> What are other possible problems?\n\nThere are a number of other possible problems with Transformer training. One which we highlight in Section 3.4 is vanishing updates due to the AdamW epsilon hyperparameter. Another potential problem is slower learning due to \u201cfast loss spikes\u201d, as discussed in Section 4. Overall, we believe our results suggest that additional potential instabilities can be studied using small-scale proxy models.\n\n> What do we learn in the end from your analysis?\n\nOverall we learn that we can reproduce, study, and predict Transformer training instabilities at large-scale using small-scale proxy models. The revised conclusion shares some highlights: \u201cThis paper demonstrates that useful insights on instability can be gained from small Transformers. Our results indicate that: (1) instabilities previously reported at scale can be reproduced in small-scale proxy models, facilitating their study without access to large resource pools; 2) instabilities previously reported at scale can be predicted before they emerge by extrapolating from experiments with small-scale proxy models; and 3) new instabilities can be found using small-scale proxy models.\u201d.\n\n> Is it clear that such problems don't arise in other architectures?\n\nWe believe that further experimental evidence would be required to make concrete conclusions about other architectures. However, a similar instability to attention logit growth would likely not occur in MLPs or CNNs. This is because, as we hypothesize (in Section 3.1.1), this instability may result from the quadratic dependence of attention logits on parameter norms. This quadratic dependence does not occur in MLPs or CNNs.\n\nIn response to the weaknesses:\n\n> The structure of the paper is a little weird (the conclusion is very short and contains no useful information, the discussion of existing results is just put at the end without much being done from it, the main points seem to be made in the figures. ).\n\nWe acknowledge this oversight. In our revision we have changed the conclusion so that it is more informative. It now reads: \u201cThis paper demonstrates that useful insights on instability can be gained from small Transformers. Our results indicate that: (1) instabilities previously reported at scale can be reproduced in small-scale proxy models, facilitating their study without access to large resource pools; 2) instabilities previously reported at scale can be predicted before they emerge by extrapolating from experiments with small-scale proxy models; and 3) new instabilities can be found using small-scale proxy models.\u201d\n\n\n> The way the logits in the attention mechanism pose problem is not made super clear or intuitive (obviously, it's a little hard to prove something, but at least some intuition would be appreciated). For instance, we learn that high enough learning rate will pose problem at some point, but that's the kind of things that is not surprising. Does this validate the whole hypothesis?\n\nWe agree that intuition could be helpful. However, further experiments may be required to make concrete conclusions. One reason a large attention logit could cause an issue is by saturating softmax and restricting gradient flow.\n\nIn response to additional comments:\n\n> The authors' main point seems to be about the attention and output logits in transformer yielding instabilities. This may be a valid point, although it is not very how to mitigate this problem [...].\n\nWe believe our results indicate that z-loss and qk-layernorm are effective mitigations which enable stable Transformer training even at high learning rates.\n\n> Do authors use uniform distribution over lr? If yes, why not uniform over log(lr)?\n\nThe learning rate values we use in our experiments are (approximately) evenly spaced on a log scale: [1e-4, 3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3, 1e-2, 3e-2, 1e-1, 3e-1, 1e0]."

The central contribution is the reproduction and analysis as small scale of instabilities that were previously observed on large-scale models. This allows to study the stability of those models without needing the large computing power required for large-scale training.\n\nTwo central kind of instabilities are studied by the authors: the growth of logic in attention layers, and the divergence of output logits of the model. In both cases, it is experimentally shown that those instability can be reproduced on small models when using a large learning rate, and that the mitigation techniques that were developed for large models are equally effective in this context. The core tool used for this analysis is introduced to be the measure of the sensibility of the model performance to the learning rate used for the optimization, and the experimental results show that those mitigations tend to reduce that sensibility, stabilizing the training.\n\nThe authors finally extend their analysis to study the impact of several other interventions that have been proposed, such as the parameterization of the trainable weights, the integration of weight decay in the optimizer, the scaling of the model size and the use of warm-up periods."

Despite limits on the size of models they can train, academic researchers have successfully studied many different aspects of Transformer-based models. There is some published research regarding Transformer training instability [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], but it has been less popular than e.g. architecture, likely due to perceived difficulty of studying training instability on a small compute budget. Our goal is to enable such studies by showing that it is possible to elicit training instabilities representative of those observed at large scale in smaller models. While Transformer training instability is currently a niche topic, we believe that it is both scientifically interesting and practically impactful, and we hope our work is a useful step in enabling more researchers to explore this area.\n\n[1] Gilmer et al., 2021.

                        "value": "Thank you for the comprehensive and thoughtful review. We are very glad you found the work to include a number of useful findings and insights. We hope that our comments below resolve any remaining questions:\n\n> Figure 1: The caption says \"LR sensitivity measures the expected deviation from optimal.\" What do the authors mean by \"optimal\" in this context? Is the meaning of \"optimal\" coming from the discussion in section 2.2? Some clarification on this in the main text would be good.\n\nWe apologize that this was unclear. In this context, we use optimal to refer to $\\ell^*$ in Section 2.2, which is the minimum loss achieved in the learning rate sweep. To address this, we have revised the caption to read \u201cLR sensitivity measures the expected deviation from the minimum achieved loss when varying learning rate across three orders of magnitude\u201d.\n\n> Introduction comment: \"One interesting finding is that scaling depth increases LR sensitivity at a faster rate than scaling width.\" One factor at play with this finding may be the fact that in standard initialisation schemes, changing the width of the network affects the initialisation scale of the weights, whereas increasing the depth does not. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that changing the width does not impact stability as much as depth, because the change in width is somewhat accounted for by the adaptive initialisation. Can the authors comment on why this occurs?\n\nWe believe it is an open question why depth increases LR sensitivity at a faster rate than width in our experiments. As you suggest, a different initialization or parameterization when scaling depth may resolve this issue. This is an interesting question for future research.\n\n> Point on phrasing: In section 3.3 the authors write \"We now examine whether it is possible to predict the logit growth instability before it occurs.\" I think this phrasing is a little ambiguous because it may be interpreted as predicting whether a logit growth instability will occur in an ongoing run, based on the data collected in the current run. By contrast, to my understanding, the authors are using previous runs with different hyperparameters, to determine whether a particular hyperparameter setting will cause an instability or not. I think stating this more clearly in the main text would be beneficial.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We agree and have changed the main text to state this more clearly as you\u2019ve recommended. In our revised version, Section 3.3 begins with: \u201cA central question when studying instabilities is whether they can be predicted using small-scale proxy experiments. We now examine whether it is possible to predict the logit growth instability before it occurs using previous runs with smaller models.\u201d.\n\n> Effect of different optimisers: To my understanding, all experiments in this paper use AdamW. Can the authors comment on whether they expect their findings to extend to other commonly used optimisers?\n\nIndeed, we use AdamW in our experiments. We choose AdamW because it is a popular optimizer used for many large scale runs including GPT-3 and LLaMA. We believe that some of the Transformer training instabilities we study are present when using other optimizer variants. For instance, the output logit divergence instability (Section 3.1.2) is reported by Chowdhery et al., 2022 for the PaLM model, which uses the \u201cparameter scaling\u201d feature from Adafactor. On the other hand, we expect that some instabilities we study are absent when using other optimizers. For instance, the epsilon instability from Section 3.4 is not expected when using SGD, since SGD has no epsilon hyperparameter.\n\n> Weaknesses: \u201cAbsence of concrete rules of thumb\u201d and \u201cLimitation to C4 data\u201d.\n\nWe absolutely agree with these limitations. We have revised Section 5 to include a subsection which highlights both of these limitations.\n\nAs you highlight in your review, \u201cthe experimental work in this paper was well executed and carefully controlled\u201d. Unfortunately, we believe that in order to provide concrete rules of thumb or study the effect of data, a large number of further experiments would be required for us to be confident in the findings and maintain the overall standard of careful experimentation. Therefore, we believe that these directions are promising topics for further research, but beyond the scope of our investigation."
