                        "value": "Thank you very much for your insightful feedbacks. We will address each of your feedbacks, respectively.\n\nQuestion 1: Could you explain in more details why the concept of functional is important in KasF?\nResponse: We appreciate your feedback and will provide a more detailed elaboration on the concept of \"functional\" in the revision.\n\nThe term \"functional\" is employed to interpret knowledge because we advocate for a dynamic approach to knowledge representation rather than a fixed dimensional distributed encoding. Knowledge, in our view, is a concept that reflects relative correctness rather than an absolute and unchanging representation. The reliability of the same knowledge can vary across different application scenarios, or the semantic fields, as discussed in the paper. Consequently, we propose understanding knowledge as a dynamic function that adapts to the demands of specific task scenarios.\n\nGiven the complexity of task scenarios as intricate functions, it is advantageous to conceptualize knowledge as a \"functional,\" i.e., a function of functions. In practical applications, KasF not only reads implicit linguistic features embedded in input X and establishes semantic relationships between them as a function, but also determines how these semantic relationships should be operated based on input X. In essence, it generates a function to govern these semantic functions as a whole rather than in the distributed form, and resulting in the final output. This process involves leveraging knowledge functions to explore/exploit the semantic functions, a concept we refer to as \"knowledge functionalization.\"\n\n\nQuestion 2: Could KasF be easily transferred to the use of LLMs?\n\nResponse:\nThank you for the insightful comments. The answer is definitely YES. Based on your suggestion, we conducted additional experiments on three distinct benchmarks (CommonsenseQA, PIQA, and SocialiQA) to assess the efficacy of KasF. Our findings demonstrate that KasF can significantly enhance the performance of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B by simply replacing the output linear layers with the KasF module. For a detailed discussion, kindly refer to our response to Reviewer CBXQ\u2019s Question 1.\n\nMoreover, our investigations extend to the domain of language modeling, where we replaced traditional transformer blocks with KasF modules to construct a language model. Specifically, we substituted a standard transformer layer with our KasF module, resulting in a new language model with 83.1 million parameters. Trained on the WikiText103 dataset, this model achieved a test perplexity (PPL) of 19.74, outperforming benchmarks such as BERT-Large (395 million parameters, PPL of 20.4), GPT2-large (774 million parameters, PPL of 22.05), and Hybrid H3 (125 million parameters, PPL of 23.7). These results highlight the competitive performance of our approach in language modeling compared to other prominent language models.\n\nQuestion 3: What is the additional computational cost brought by KasF compared to the backbone language model?\n\nResponse: \nIn practical computations, when substituting the original output layer of a foundation language model with KasF, the computational cost shows negligible variation. In fact, it might even be slightly improved compared to the initial configuration. This is attributable to the fact that the parameter scale of KasF, compared to the entire language model, is much smaller. Moreover, KasF decomposes the extensive matrix operations associated with the original FC Linear layer into multiple smaller matrix operations that can be concurrently processed. Despite the KasF-based model's increased complexity compared to the original FC Linear layer, the actual runtime remains unchanged. We also conducted a comparative analysis of real-time consumption between Transformer and KasF modules with equivalent parameter scales. Our findings indicate that the Transformer operates at a speed of 10.23 ms/batch, whereas KasF achieves a speed of 6.33 ms/batch. Furthermore, the actual runtime of KasF can be further reduced with more advanced CUDA packages related to the metrics-based operations applied in the method. We will include more detail and discussions in the revision."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your valuable review comments, which significantly help us improving our work. We will address each of your questions, respectively.\n\nQuestion1: The example provided in Section 2.1 of the methods part seems inadequate. Why not illustrate the concept with a more direct example, such as a Question-Answering (QA) scenario? \n\nResponse: \nThank you for your valuable insights. To enhance clarity, we will incorporate more direct examples in the revision to elucidate our approach. The choice of semantic compression as an illustration is stemmed from our objective to showcase KasF's superiority in expressing complex latent semantic features with fewer parameters. \n\nSecond, it is important to note that the method presented in Section 2.1 serves as an early prototype of KasF, which has already been successfully applied in various real-world scenarios involving semantic compression and semantic understanding. As a result, we believed it is pertinent to reference this early prototype in the paper.\n\nWe genuinely appreciate your suggestions and are open to integrating them into the revised manuscript. Specifically, we plan to provide more intuitive examples, such as those related to question-answering, to further articulate the inspiration behind KasF. At the same time, we will move the semantic compression part into the appendix.\n\nQuestion 2: In Table 2, only the time cost for KasF is listed. For a comprehensive comparison, it would be beneficial to include the time costs associated with other methods as well.\n\nResponse:\nThank you for your suggestion.\nActually, we guessed that what you mentioned as \u2018Table 2\u2019 is actually \u2018Table 1\u2019. Regarding Table 1, we explicitly set the computational budget as one of our objectives. Therefore, the time cost for KasF and other methods is a controlled variable, which indicates that methods listed in the same column, not just KasF but also iPCA, kPCA, LLE and Isomap, have been adjusted to have nearly identical time costs. \n\nQuestion 3: Regarding Table 4, which specific model from the GPT-3.5 series was selected for the comparison? \n\nResponse:\nWe use the GPT3.5-turbo for the comparison. We will clarify this detail in the revision. Thanks for your suggestion.\n\nQuestion 4: The authors emphasize KasF's advantage over FC Linear in terms of having fewer parameters. However, it would be more logical to compare KasF with other semantic compression methods to provide a fair and accurate assessment.\n\nResponse:\nThank you for your feedback.\nIt's important to clarify that the merit of KasF over FC does not solely lies in having fewer parameters. Instead, its strength lies in its ability to capture a richer set of semantic features, and consequently enhancing the model's accuracy across tasks. As illustrated in Table 2, when we substitute the output layer of the base model with Transformer and KasF, it becomes evident that KasF demonstrates the most significant improvement with the fewest parameters.\n\nIn this particular task, KasF is not merely a parameter compression technique; instead, it functions as a neural structure akin to Transformer, enabling it to capture a more extensive array of hidden features. If we were to employ a semantic compression algorithm aimed at reducing parameters, it might indeed achieve parameter reduction, but it would likely result in a loss of performance. To illustrate, we conducted additional experiments on SQuAD-v2 using ALBERTa-base as the backbone model:\n\n| Output Layer     | No.Params | EM    | F1    | Improvement |\n|------------------|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|\n| FC Linear        | 0.59M     | 75.82 | 78.91 | 0           |\n| FC Linear (SVD)  | 0.29M     | 74.93 | 75.65 | -0.89       |\n| FC Linear (kPCA) | 0.30M     | 75.03 | 76.04 | -0.79       |\n| Transformer      | 2.98M     | 76.25 | 79.46 | +0.43       |\n| KasF (G4-D30)    | 0.25M     | 76.68 | 78.82 | +0.86       |\n| KasF (G4-D50)    | 0.41M     | 77.18 | 80.31 | +1.36       |\n\nThis new set of empirical results indicate that the application of semantic compression techniques substantially compromises the model's accuracy, leading to negative improvements. In contrast, KasF has demonstrated its ability to capture more latent patterns, thereby contributing to improved model performance. We will clarify this point in the revision."

                        "value": "Question 5: To strengthen the credibility and significance of KasF, applying it to newer knowledge reasoning datasets or integrating it with open-source large language models like LLaMa would be a valuable extension of this work.\n\nResponse:\nThank you for your insightful comments. We present two distinct mechanisms for incorporating KasF into open-source LLM.\n\nThe first mechanism is tailored for specific reasoning tasks, involving the straightforward replacement of the LLM's output linear layer with a KasF module. We conducted additional experiments using pre-trained LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B on three reasoning benchmarks (CommonsenseQA, SocialiQA, and PiQA). Our results consistently show improved accuracies on the validation sets, as detailed in our response to Reviewer CBXQ's Question 1. Notably, the reasoning ability can be further enhanced through comprehensive fine-tuning, if given sufficient computational resources and external knowledge bases.\n\nThe second mechanism is designed for the broader application of LLM. Specifically, we substitute a typical transformer layer with our KasF module to construct a new language model. The resulting language model, comprising of 83.1 million parameters, is trained using the WikiText103 dataset and achieves a test Perplexity (PPL) of 19.74. This outperforms BERT-Large (395 million parameters with a PPL of 20.4), GPT2-large (774 million parameters with a PPL of 22.05), and Hybrid H3 (125 million parameters with a PPL of 23.7)."

Specifically, based on the dynamics inspiration, a sentence is treated as a semantic flow among semantic units (tokens/words). The representation is formulated as a functional, from the initial to the end token of a sentence, with a task specific objective. The authors implement the formulation with LLMs like RoBERTa, ALBERT as base models. They evaluate the proposed KasF on multiple QA benchmarks, i.e., WikiQA, SQuAD2, and CSQA. Specially, on CSQA, KasF achieves the state-of-the-art single-model performance on the blind test set."

We will continue to strive to improve our approach.\n\nQuestion 1: Would it be possible to adapt the approach beyond classification-style QA tasks? e.g., generative QA, reasoning on knowledge graphs, etc.\n\nResponse: \nIn addition to handling classification tasks, our KasF can function as a non-linear mapping module similar to Transformer. We utilized it to construct a language model from scratch with training data from WikiText103, featuring 83.1 million parameters. This model achieved a Perplexity (PPL) of 19.74 on WikiText103, surpassing other comparable language models such as BERT-Large (395 million parameters with a PPL of 20.4), GPT2-large (774 million parameters with a PPL of 22.05), and Hybrid H3 (125 million parameters with a PPL of 23.7).\n\nMoreover, our KasF can seamlessly integrate with knowledge graphs, enabling more generalized reasoning. Specifically, by substituting the dynamic state Q of semantic units with embeddings of entities from a knowledge graph, one can establish a semantic field. We redefine the metric between Qs as the vector of relations between entities, creating an independent semantic field detached from the input X. In our experiments on CommonsenseQA (CsQA), employing this approach to convey knowledge related to queries through corresponding triplets in ConceptNet led to a notable 3.5% improvement in model accuracy. We did not report this part of result because of the evaluation policy of CsQA that forbids the usage of ConceptNet. However, we will consider to incorporate some discussion on this in the revision.\n\nFurthermore, our research suggests that ensuring precision and accuracy in the independent semantic field through manual annotation can further enhance the model accuracy to over 94%. This indicates the considerable potential for an enhanced KasF through integration with well-established external knowledge bases."

                    "value": "I confess I don't really understand more than 10% of this paper but I will try to provide a summary of parts that I understood.\n\nOverall, the paper tries to provide a new mechanism to improve performance on reasoning tasks by encoding various inputs (queries, documents, etc) using \"functionals\". These functionals are somehow supposed to capture multiple meanings associated with any input word and group provide a grouped representation of words with shared semantics in context. In Section 2, the authors provide a description of their method but I don't understand any part of it since most of the definitions of mathematical symbols are either assumed or just not provided. The first task that authors initialize their method for is semantic compression, which in standard NLP, is simply the task of mapping input text (queries, etc) to simpler representations (for example, remapping the tokens with hypernyms, using distributed representation, etc). In Section 2.1, the authors are trying to do this compression for a query vector defined as $y \\in R^{D_v \\times 1}$, yet  it is unclear what D_v is. They also use a symbol $V \\in R^{n \\times D_v}$ but again it is unclear what n or V is supposed to be here. Other symbols, $z, \\gamma, P$, etc are introduced in this section but not defined. As such. by end of it, I am not sure what really is the output we are aiming for and how is it derived.\n\nSimilarly, Section 2.2, which I conclude is the main method description is mostly unreadable to me. The most I can conclude is that the authors are trying to use their method to provide a sequence to sequence mapping mechanism (from a input sequence X to output sequence Y). \n\nIn the experiment section, the authors are evaluating their method on 3 datasets - wikiQA, SQuAD and CommensenseQA. But given my lack of understanding of method section, I can't really evaluate this intelligently. The best I conclude is that the authors method outperform their baselines for both semantic compression and Reading Compression."

We will continue to enhance the readability of our paper by incorporating more intuitive examples in both the main text and appendices to further illustrate our theoretical framework. While our paper may still have some issues that can be addressed, based on the feedback from several other reviewers, we believe that the readability of our paper does not significantly compromise its overall quality. It also contributes valuable insights to the relevant field. Therefore, we hope you reconsider your comprehensive evaluation of our paper. Thank you very much.\n\nQuestion 1: In Section 2.1, I would like to understand what exactly is the task being performanced -- 1) what is the input (please provide an example), 2) what is the output, 3) what does symbols D_v, V, N, z means?\n\nResponse: As stated in Section 2.1, the task performed is a typical semantic compression task on the scenario of query-document search. \nThe input is a sentence encoded as a sentence embedding, i.e., a vector of a dimension D_v.\nThe output is the indices of the documents that are semantically similar to the input query.\nThe targert algorithm is designed to compress the given documents, i.e., a set of sentence embeddings, to reduce the actual runtime while maintaining the query accuracy. The symbol D_v is the original dimension of the encodings, i.e., the documents, the symbol V is the set of n documents, z is the query result, i.e., z=Vy, where y is a query vector.\n\nIn summary, Section 2.1 serves as a preliminary demonstration, illustrating that interpreting \"knowledge\" as a function rather than fixed encoding may result in more powerful representational capabilities. We formalize this concept in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, where we introduce a novel non-linear neural layer, namely the KasF block (which can be seen as an alternative to the Transformer). \nWe conducted experiments on various Question-Answering (OA) tasks. In a typical OA task, the model takes an input sequence in the form of \"Question X - Candidate 1 - Candidate 2 - ... - Candidate k\" and produces a k-dimensional output vector. Each element in the output vector represents the probability that the corresponding candidate is the correct answer to Question X.\nOur KasF module maps each token of the Question X and the candidates into the dynamical states of neurons/nodes, then we can obtain the resulting \u201cforce\u201d of each neuron referring to a candidate. Finally, we compare the resulting \u201cforce\u201d with the ones extracted from the training datasets, using a trainable metric function, to get the best matched candidates. The empirical results in the QA task show that this KasF block significantly enhances a language model's efficiency in extracting deep-level knowledge representations, thereby improving its capacity for knowledge inference."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your review comments. We will address each of your questions and weaknesses, respectively.\n\nQuestion 1: How well does the KasF generalize to unseen datasets that are similar to CommonsenseQA, e.g., SocialIQA, PIQA, RiddleSense?\n\nResponse: \nThank you for your suggestion. We have expanded our experimentation by utilizing the pre-trained LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA2-13B models on three distinct reasoning benchmarks: CommonsenseQA, SocialiQA, and PiQA. Due to limited computational resources, we opted for a pragmatic approach, replacing the output linear layer (e.g., 4096*32000) with our proposed KasF structure. Subsequently, we fine-tuned the added KasF on each benchmark's training set while keeping the LLaMA's parameters fixed. Our results demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy on the validation sets.\n|                 | CommonsenseQA | PIQA | Social iQA |\n|-----------------|---------------|------|------------|\n| LLaMA2-7B       | 57.8          | 78.8 | 48.3       |\n| LLaMA2-7B+KasF  | 59.2          | 80.0 | 49.4       |\n| LLaMA2-13B      | 67.3          | 80.5 | 50.3       |\n| LLaMA2-13B+KasF | 69.3          | 81.1 | 51.5       |\n\nIt's worth noting that the reasoning ability can potentially be further enhanced, provided richer computational resources and access to external knowledge bases, without imposing constraints on fixing the LLaMA's parameters. We will include the new results into the revision.\n\nQuestion 2: How does the KasF model integrate with large external knowledge bases, and what is the impact on its performance when external knowledge is incorporated? Is it possible to do that?\n\nResponse:\nCertainly, the integration of the KasF module with external knowledge bases is feasible. To elaborate, one can establish a semantic field in the form of a knowledge graph by substituting the dynamic state Q of semantic units with embeddings of entities from a knowledge graph. Following this, we change the metric between Qs as the vector of relations between entities, creating an independent semantic field detached from the input X. In our preliminary experiments conducted on CommonsenseQA (CsQA), we noted that adopting the mentioned approach to convey knowledge related to the query using corresponding triplets in ConceptNet led to an improvement of approximately 3.5% in model accuracy. Nevertheless, due to the evaluation protocol of CsQA that ConceptNet is not allowed to use, we have not included this part of results in the paper.\n\nFurthermore, our findings indicate that by ensuring precision and accuracy in the independent semantic field through manual annotation, the model accuracy could be enhanced to over 94%, showing the significant potential for an enhanced KasF through integration with well-established external knowledge bases.\n\nBased on the above discussion, we will provide more discussion in the revision on the potential of incorporating external knowledge bases.\n\nQuestion 3: Is it feasible to connect KasF to the decoder-only models such as Llama?\n\nResponse: \nFirst, regarding the integration of KasF with LLaMA for specific reasoning tasks, please refer to the response provided for Question 1. \n\nSecond, for the application in generation tasks, we have tried replacing some of the transformer layers in LLaMA with our KasF module, i.e., each KasF module takes text embeddings as the inputs and returns the outputs in terms of Eq 8, which are normalized as the inputs to a subsequent KasF module. The exact building mechanism is like a primary decoder-only LM, except that the transformer module is replaced with a KasF module. More precisely, substituting a standard transformer layer with our KasF module allows us to construct a decoder-only language model from scratch. On a preliminary language modeling task, we observe that constructing a language model using KasF from scratch can yield a competitive Perplexity (PPL) comparable to prominent Language Models (LLMs) like GPT2.\n\nIn more detail, the above-mentioned language model, featuring 83.1 million parameters, is trained on the WikiText103 dataset and achieves a test perplexity 19.74. This outperforms other models such as BERT-Large (395 million parameters with a PPL of 20.4), GPT2-large (774 million parameters with a PPL of 22.05), and Hybrid H3 (125 million parameters with a PPL of 23.7).\n\nThe above-mentioned results fully prove the feasibility of KasF on decoder-only purposes. Obviously, the answer is YES. We will include more details and information in the revision."

How to generalize KasF tasks beyond those evaluated. \n\nResponse: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. \nWe are committed to improving the accuracy and efficiency of our method to enhance its applicability across a broader spectrum. Notably, our proposed KasF serves as a viable alternative to nonlinear layers, such as the Transformer block, within a language model. As detailed in our response to Question 3, constructing a language model from scratch using KasF yields competitive performance in language modeling tasks when compared to other Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT2. \nFurthermore, our KasF module can be extended to a knowledge-driven block that explicitly deals with knowledge bases, which support learning with both unstructured data and structured knowledge. \nThis suggests the potential of our approach beyond the specific tasks evaluated in the manuscript.\n\nWe are confident that, given sufficient computational resources, our method indeed has the capacity to exhibit superior performance across a wider range of reasoning tasks. We will provide more discussion on this point in the revision.\n\n\nWeakness 3: The paper might lack a deeper theoretical discussion on the limitations of the functional representation of knowledge, which would be important for future research to build upon or address its shortcomings.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your valuable feedback. In the revision, we plan to incorporate a dedicated section (or in the appendix) that delves into the theoretical underpinnings of our methodology. Regarding the limitations of our approach, they can be categorized into two main points.\n\n1. CUDA Implementation: One challenge we face is the limited availability of well-established CUDA packages for efficiently computing metric-based operations that are intensively required by our method. Integrating our approach into the Large Language Model (LLM) community demands additional efforts, particularly in terms of CUDA implementation and acceleration.\n\n2. Hyper-parameter Tuning: The introduction of novel concepts in our method, such as neuronal groups, represents an area that is not extensively explored in the existing literature. Consequently, further investigations are needed to empirically establish the relationships between these concepts and their theoretical implications. We acknowledge the importance of refining the content regarding to these novel elements and will address this concern in the revision by providing additional insights and analyses."
