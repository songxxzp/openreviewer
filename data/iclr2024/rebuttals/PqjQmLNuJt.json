Particularly,\n    * Equations 3,4,5,7 (DDLR) are the same as Equations 6,8,9,10 from A*Net with the same notation and descriptions\n    * The priority function $s_{uq}(x)$ is named as \u201clearnable path scoring function\u201d in DDLR instead of \u201cneural priority function\u201d in A\\*Net\n\nEven if we omit the borrowed A\\*Net content from the list of contributions, the paper boils down to pre-computing co-occurences of all pairs of relations and tuning the threshold manually for each dataset - this is not a substantial algorithmic contribution per se.\n\nOverall, I believe the paper should be rejected as it clearly violates the ICLR Code of Ethics (that authors are supposed to accept upon the submission) and escalated to the AC / SAC / PC level for further investigation.\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04798"
