                    "value": "The paper proposes a strategy to detect harmful instruction prompts called \u201cerase-and-check\u201d. Given a prompt, \u201cerase-and-check\u201d will traverse every subsequence of the input and let Llama2 check whether the subsequence is harmful. If any subsequence is detected as harmful, the prompt will be labeled as harmful. In experiments, the paper considers three scenarios and shows the running time of \u201cerase-and-check\u201d as well as the percentage of safe prompts labeled as safe."

                        "value": "Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work.\nWe have updated our draft with additional experimental results including a trained DistilBERT text classifier for the safety filter (instead of Llama 2).\nThis significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of our procedure (Section 5).\nPlease see our global response above for more details on the new results.\n\nIn the following, we address the concerns raised in the review.\n\n1. \"The experimental setting is impractical in the case of \u201cadversarial suffix\u201d and \u201cadversarial insertion\u201d...\"\n\n    Adversarial safety attacks studied so far, such as GCG [1] and AutoDAN [2, 3], fall into the categories of adversarial suffix and adversarial insertion.\n    Knowledge of the attack mode allows us to tailor our procedure for that mode and achieve improved efficiency and accuracy.\n    For instance, if we do not know whether the adversarial sequence is inserted in the middle or at the end of the harmful prompt, we can use eras-and-check in the insertion mode, which subsumes the suffix mode.\n    However, if we know the insertion's location, say suffix (or prefix), we can tailor our procedure to defend against this specific threat model and significantly improve its efficiency.\n    \n    Also, assuming a threat model such as $\\ell_1, \\ell_2$, etc. for the attack, is conventional in the adversarial robustness literature and often needed to obtain certified guarantees.\n    It is also acceptable to design defenses against specific threat models, e.g., using the Gaussian noise distribution to defend against $\\ell_2$ attacks [4] and using the Laplace distribution for $\\ell_1$ attacks [5].\n\n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n    [2] AutoDAN: Generating Stealthy Jailbreak Prompts on Aligned Large Language Models, Liu et al., 2023.\n\n    [3] AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models, Zhu et al., 2023.\n\n    [4] Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing, Cohen et al., ICML 2019\n    \n    [5] $\\ell_1$ Adversarial Robustness Certificates: a Randomized Smoothing Approach, Teng et al., 2020.\n\n2. \"The size of samples in the experiments is relatively small, which could make the results unreliable. Especially, for \u201cadversarial infusion\u201d, the authors only used 30 samples.\"\n\n    The more general threat models like adversrial infusion are harder to defend against.\n    The running time of erase-and-check in this threat model is high, limiting the number of samples we could evaluate it on.\n    However, with more time to perform experiments, we have now revised the plots for infusion with 100 samples and the results do not change significantly (Appendix C).\n\n3. \"The performance of the proposed method is unclear to me. I did not see a figure to show the percentage of \u201charmful prompts labeled as harmful\u201d\"\n\n    We report the certified accuracy on the harmful prompts for Llama 2 (92%) and DistilBERT (100%) in the Safety Certificate subsection in the Introduction section (highlighted in boldface).\n    This certified accuracy does not depend on the maximum erase length $d$ of erase-and-check.\n    Thus, if we were to plot the certified accuracy on the harmful prompts as in Figures 3(a) and 4(a), all the bars would have the same height.\n\n    For the randomized erase-and-check (part of the new experiments), we evaluate its empirical accuracy on adversarial prompts produced by the GCG attack for different adversarial lengths (Appendix F, Figure 11).\n\n4. \"The defensive strategy seems to be not sound. It only considers that the adversary could add extra tokens into the harmful prompts to jailbreak the LLM...\"\n\n    We focus on adversarial prompts that add maliciously designed tokens to bypass the safety guardrails of an aligned language model and our safety certificates hold for the threat models defined in the paper.\n    Adversarial attacks studied so far, such as GCG [1] and AutoDAN [2, 3], fall into this category.\n    To the best of our knowledge, LLM safety attacks that manipulate the original harmful prompt, such as delete or replace tokens, have not been proposed in the literature yet.\n    However, when such attacks are designed, it would be interesting to test the empirical performance (especially the randomized erase-and-check in Appendix F) of our approach against them.\n\n5. \"What is the percentage of \u201charmful prompts labeled as harmful\u201d w.r.t. the maximum tokens erased?\"\n\n    As mentioned in point 3, the certified accuracy of our procedure is independent of the maximum tokens erased. Thus, if we were to plot the certified accuracy w.r.t the maximum tokens erased, all bars would have the same height."

                        "value": "Hi Authors,\n\nThanks for your replies and additional experimental results. Some of my concerns have been addressed. However, I will keep my rating. The following are my reasons:\n\n1. If we do not know how the adversary works, we can only use the `infusion` mode. If using the `suffix` or `insertion` mode, it is unlikely to detect the adversarial prompt. It is different from random smoothing. I suppose using $\\ell_2$ random smoothing method can defend against $\\ell_1$ adversarial perturbations to some extent. However, if we do not use `infusion` mode, your defense could not work at all when the adversary uses the `infusion`. That is to say, I suppose only the `infusion` mode is practical.\n\n2. Although the certified accuracy is constant, obtaining this accuracy in the `infusion` mode requires a large amount of running time, which degrades its practical usage. The `infusion` mode has a high time complexity. Especially, when the length of the prompt is arguably long, the checking procedure will be very slow, which is a significant shortcoming of the proposed method. It is unreasonable to let the user wait for a long time for the check after each query. Given this significant drawback, I will keep my score."

                        "value": "Thank you for your response. Below, we address your concerns:\n\n1. Existing adversarial safety attacks like GCG and AutoDAN fall into the suffix and insertion attack categories. Our procedure can achieve good certified guarantees quickly with just one GPU in these modes. To our knowledge, adversarial safety attacks in the infusion mode have not yet been developed. Due to its generality, the infusion mode requires more work to certify against. This is true even for existing certified robustness techniques like randomized smoothing. Randomized smoothing suffers from the curse of dimensionality against more general threat models such as L-infinity [1].\n\n   [1] Curse of Dimensionality on Randomized Smoothing for Certifiable Robustness, Kumar et al., ICML 2020.\n\n2. While the running time is high in the infusion mode (the most general mode), our erase-and-check procedure is highly parallelizable. Evaluating the safety filter on one erased subsequence does not affect its prediction on another subsequence. Thus, increasing processing power will reduce the running time of our procedure. All the running times reported in our paper are for a single GPU. As processors become cheaper and more powerful in the future, the certificate size of our procedure can be increased.\n\n    However, existing robustness approaches like randomized smoothing may not improve much, even with increased processing power. This is because the size of the certificate is limited by the overlap between the smoothing distributions between the original and the perturbed input. This overlap decreases rapidly with the distance between the two inputs. As we show in Figure 10 in Appendix E, the safety guarantees from randomized smoothing deteriorate rapidly with the certified length."

This defense first obtains a set of token subsequences of the examined prompt by removing tokens and then alarms harmful content when any one of the subsequences is determined as harmful by Llama-2. This paper considers three kinds of prompt injection attacks, namely suffix, insertion, and infusion. This defense is claimed as a certified defense, in the sense that it conducts an exhaustive search to recover the original unperturbed prompt, which is guaranteed when the number of injected tokens is lower than the number of tokens being removed during the search."

                    "value": "### Originality\n\n**Q1: The claimed \"certified\" defense is essentially an exhaustive search of the original unperturbed prompt.**\n\nI am a bit concerned about the novelty of this paper, since the proposed \"certified\" defense is essentially an exhaustive search to recover the original unperturbed prompt. This notion is different from the compared randomized smoothing (Q7), which leverages random sampling and the Neyman-Pearson lemma to estimate the probabilistic certificate. While it is okay for the proposed certificate to be deterministic (since there are many deterministic certified defenses for vision models), its practical time complexity only comes from the two simplified attack settings (Q2-3). Given this, it is not very convincing that a simple exhaustive search would provide much novelty, unless there are other key contributions that I miss.\n\n### Quality\n\n**Q2: The defense assumes invalid knowledge of the attack's setting.**\n\nThis paper correctly defines three attack modes with increased generalizability, namely adversarial suffix, insertion, and infusion. However, the defense was incorrectly discussed and evaluated with the knowledge of which attack was defended against. For example, how would the defense ensure that the attacker injected an adversarial suffix rather than something else? Given an adversarial prompt, a reasonable certificate from this defense is that the prompt does not contain an adversarial suffix up to a certain length, but that guarantee is attack-specific, and hence the safety against other kinds of attacks is still unknown. Note that RS certifies against *any* perturbation produced by *any* attack within an L2 radius, or would this paper justify that the difference between suffix/insertion attacks is similar to that between L2/Linf attacks?\n\n**Q3: The combinational searching space is impractical.**\n\nThe general case incurs a combinational search space due to the defense's exhaustive search design. First, this is the exact case that a defense should focus on, as the defense does not know the attack's (easier) mode beforehand. Second, the authors did not report the original unperturbed prompt's length $n$ anywhere in the paper (if I did not miss it), which worsens the practicability. Assuming the original prompt has 100 tokens and 5 tokens are randomly injected, the search space would be ${100 \\choose 5}\\approx75M$ subsequences. I find it hard to justify the practicability of this search space.\n\n**Q4: The safety filter's FPR will escalate with the search space.**\n\nOne key metric not discussed in the paper is the safety filter's false positive rate, or the percentage of safe prompts classified as malicious by Llama 2. This is important because the FPR will likely escalate as the search space increases, especially given that the defense would determine the prompt as harmful when any one of the testing subsequences is predicted as harmful. For example, say the FPR is $p$, the overall FPR for $d$ safe subsequences (of one original safe prompt) would be $1 - (1-p)^d$, which grows exponentially in the number of subsequences. Even with an initial $p=0.01$, the final FPR for $d=20$ would be around 0.182.\n\nThis is more impractical when the search space is combinational (Q3). While this is justified in the paper, I do not think one could train a sufficiently precise classifier with some exponentially low FPR: the classifier cannot make *any* mistake in $\\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ subsequences.\n\n**Q5: Theorem 1 is based on \"is-harmful\", but the evaluation focused on \"not is-harmful.\"**\n\nBelow Theorem 1, it is claimed that \"to certify the performance ... on *harmful prompts*, we just need to evaluate the safety filter on *those prompts*.\" But all experiments (the green bars) evaluate the safety filter on *safe prompts*. It seems that the authors only evaluated 500 harmful prompts in one line and obtained 93% accuracy. On the accuracy side, this is apparent, as the exhaustive search will eventually recover the original prompt and make that much accuracy. But then the overall evaluation is more or less reduced to a benchmark of Llama-2. I wonder if the authors could evaluate the LHS of Theorem 1, which is the factual performance of this defense.\n\n**Q6: The adaptation of Randomized Smoothing is unfair and was only compared in suffix attacks.**\n\nThe design of RS is to sample around the given input and estimate a certifiable radius. For example, given an adversarial image, RS samples isotropic noisy points around the adversarial point, rather than constructively removing adversarial pixels from the image. Yet Section 4.2 adopts RS to drop a fixed set of tokens (rather than some more balanced or randomized sets) and apply majority vote. This adaptation (majority vote) is undoubtedly worse than the proposed \"veto\" strategy. It is thus suggested to discuss the validity of the current adaptation of RS in LLMs. For example, one direct adaptation of RS is to randomly drop/add tokens (as a way to sample the neighborhood) and apply majority vote.\n\n### Clarity\n\n**Q7: Missing a critical evaluation setting -- the prompt's length.**\n\nSee Q3.\n\n**Q8: Unclear soundnesses of the insight that \"subsequences of safe prompts are also safe\" due to FPR.**\n\nThe whole defense relies on the insight that \"subsequences of safe prompts are also safe.\" This is conceptually correct, but is unlikely the case, given there is no perfect classifier to realize the claim. In practice, subsequences of safe prompts are not always \"predicted as\" safe.\n\n### Significance\n\n**Q9: The defense's practicability and claimed guarantee is limited.**\n\nOverall, the provided guarantee is only over a small set of attacks, but the compared RS is for any attacks. This somewhat reduces the significance of this work, as the defender is not assured of safety against other kinds of attacks (with the same number of adversarial tokens). The claimed \"certifying\" concept is also different from the conventional concept in randomized smoothing and largely trivial due to the exhaustive search, which requires some justification."

                        "value": "It seems that the authors have finished their rebuttal and did not respond to the two negative reviews directly. After reading the responses to other reviewers and the updated draft, I have distilled my major concerns as follows. I strongly recommend the authors be upfront about these concerns.\n\n**Q1: Please explicitly report the length $n$ of the original harmful prompts.**\n\nThis is a fundamental parameter that profoundly affects the search space and computational cost. When certifying adversarial infusion with $d=5$ tokens, setting $n=10$ leads to ${10 \\choose 5} = 252$ subsequences, yet setting $n=100$ leads to ${100 \\choose 5}\\approx 75M$ subsequences. While I really appreciate the author's efforts in training a more efficient safety filter to replace LLama-2, I am afraid this optimization is $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and is not enough to drop the $\\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ complexity. \n\nSince the attacker can easily increase the length of harmful prompts by adding safe yet dummy tokens, not reporting this parameter makes it hard to assess this paper's solidness. For example, it is easy to remove adversarial tokens added to \"How to build a bomb\" but seemed impossible to do that for \"[1000 good tokens] + How to build a bomb\" using the current approach. \n\n**Q2: How to address the FPR Escalation problem?**\n\nThe authors trained a new safety filter that achieves 98% accuracy on safe prompts, meaning an FPR of 0.02 over a single safe prompt. As I mentioned in my original review, this FPR can easily escalate as the search space grows. Mathematically speaking, for $p=0.02$ and $d=20$ subsequences, the overall FPR would escalate to $1-(1-p)^d=1-0.98^{20}\\approx0.332$. Can the authors please clarify why it won't escalate as such?\n\n**Q3: Threat model.**\n\nIt is appreciated that the claim for the adversarial infusion threat model has been tuned down. However, the main problem here is how the defender would distinguish between different attack modes, such as the remaining adversarial suffix and adversarial insertion modes. In the rebuttal, the authors draw a connection to the $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models in vision attacks. However, I am not sure if suffix and insertion attacks are qualified as two different threat models like $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$. For example, in textual attacks, the budget is usually set to the number of inserted tokens but not the specific location of such insertion (they are all $\\ell_1$-norm for tokens). When deploying this defense in practice, would the authors please justify the access to such knowledge (the insertion's location)? The defense should always prepare for the general case (i.e., the general insertion) as far as I can understand.\n\n**Q4: Regarding \"certified guarantee\" vs. \"exhaustive search.\u201d**\n\nI am willing to acknowledge this concern as a philosophical question and leave the novelty assessment to the ACs.\n\nThis paper studies certified defense in two scenarios: suffix and injection/infusion attacks.\n\nFor suffix attacks, the defense's nature can be summarized in one sentence \u2014 **if we already know there is an adversarial suffix up to length $d$, we can certifiably find out the original harmful prompt by removing the last $d$ tokens one by one.** Note that I am not criticizing the defense's effectiveness or practicability, but the novelty of \"certified defense\" is questionable as the so-called \"certified\" or \"guaranteed\" outcome is rather straightforward; **defenders would not need a theorem to realize that the output is \"certifiably guaranteed.\"**\n\nFor the more general attacks, the defense adopts randomized subsampling to reduce the search space. However, as the authors have acknowledged in the rebuttal, this variant does not provide a certificate. Given this, I find the generalization of the proposed \"certified defense\" to more general attacks is limited.\n\nMy recommendation is to (1) explore deeper insights against the suffix attack and (2) explore the true certified defense (like RS) against general attacks separately. Given the current approach, mixing the two scenarios is not very convincing, as it cannot address the more general attacks efficiently."

                        "value": "Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing our work.\nThere has been a misunderstanding about the accuracy plots for the safe prompts.\nThe review says, \"But all experiments (the green bars) evaluate the safety filter on safe prompts.\"\nThe green bars *do not* represent the accuracy of the safety filter.\nInstead, they represent the accuracy of the erase-and-check procedure on the safe prompts.\n\nBelow, we address the concerns raised in the review:\n\n1. \"I am a bit concerned about the novelty of this paper ...\"\n\n    The novelty of our work comes from the following two observations:\n\n    1. Subsequences of safe prompts are also safe (in most cases).\n\n    2. It is sufficient to certify safety for harmful prompts, as adversarially attacking a safe prompt to get it flagged as harmful makes little sense in practice.\n\n    These key observations allow us to design a procedure that errs on the side of caution and labels a prompt harmful if any of its erased subsequences are labeled harmful.\n    This produces strong safety certificates on harmful prompts and achieves good empirical accuracy on safe prompts.\n\n2. \"The defense assumes invalid knowledge of the attack's setting.\"\n\n    Knowledge of the attack mode allows us to tailor our procedure for that mode and achieve improved efficiency and accuracy. For instance, if we do not know whether the adversarial sequence is inserted in the middle or at the end of the harmful prompt, we can use eras-and-check in the insertion mode, which subsumes the suffix mode. However, if we know the insertion's location, say suffix (or prefix), we can tailor our procedure to defend against this specific threat model and significantly improve its efficiency. Most adversarial attacks studied so far, such as GCG and AutoDAN, fall into this category. Thus, knowledge of the attack mode is not a requirement for our procedure but can help improve its performance.\n\n    Also, assuming a threat model such as $\\ell_1, \\ell_2$, etc., for the attack is conventional in the adversarial robustness literature and often needed to obtain certified guarantees. It is also conventional to obtain certified guarantees up to a radius r around the input, similar to the adversarial sequence length $d$ for which we certify. It is also acceptable to design defenses against specific threat models, e.g., using the Gaussian noise distribution to defend against $\\ell_2$ attacks [1] and the Laplace distribution for $\\ell_1$ attacks [2].\n\n    [1] Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing, Cohen et al., ICML 2019\n\n    [2] $\\ell_1$ Adversarial Robustness Certificates: a Randomized Smoothing Approach, Teng et al., 2020.\n\n3. \"the authors did not report the original unperturbed prompt's length $n$ anywhere in the paper\"\n\n    Following are the statistics of the tokens in the harmful prompts from AdvBench [1] (we have included them in Appendix I):\n    \n    Llama tokenizer:\n    Min: 8\n    Max: 33\n    Avg: 16.05\n\n    DistilBERT tokenizer:\n    Min: 8\n    Max: 33\n    Avg: 15.45\n\n    The number of tokens in the harmful prompts is significantly less than 100.\n    \n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n4. \"The safety filter's FPR will escalate with the search space.\"\n\n    The false positive rate can be reduced by training a safety classifier to recognize subsequences of safe prompts as safe. We achieve this by including erased versions of the safe prompts in the training set of the DistilBERT safety classifier.\n\n5. \"Below Theorem 1, it is claimed that \"to certify the performance ... on harmful prompts, we just need to evaluate the safety filter on those prompts.\" But all experiments (the green bars) evaluate the safety filter on safe prompts.\"\n\n    Firstly, as we note at the beginning of this rebuttal, the green bars *do not* represent the accuracy of the safety filter.\n    Instead, they represent the accuracy of the erase-and-check procedure on the safe prompts.\n    Secondly, we do not plot the certified accuracy vs. maximum erase length for the harmful prompts (as we do for the safe prompts) because the certified accuracy is independent of the maximum erase length.\n    If we were to plot the certified accuracy vs maximum erase length, all bars would have the same height.\n\n    For the randomized version of erase-and-check in Appendix F, we plot the empirical accuracy on adversarial harmful prompts produced by the GCG attack for different adversarial sequence lengths."

                        "value": "Thanks for the response and additional experiments; my remaining concerns are as follows.\n\n**Q1: Novelty, Threat Model, Certificate, Practicability.**\n\nI find the clarified novelty not convincing and would encourage the authors to delve deeper. I will break down this problem below, hoping to provide some constructive feedback to the authors.\n\n**1. Suffix Attacks**\n\nAs mentioned by the authors, this is the threat model the defense was designed for. I generally agree with the authors that it's okay to focus only on this threat model (even if there are more advanced attacks). However, focusing on this threat model should adequately address the following two problems.\n\n**1.1. This threat model is somewhat trivial.**\n\nThe defense is essentially an exhaustive search of the original harmful prompt \u2014 given an adversarial prompt \"[harmful prompt] + [adversarial suffix of d tokens]\", the defense trims the last d tokens one by one until \"[harmful prompt]\" remains. Yet, the outcome is claimed as a \"strong safety certificate.\" It is hard to justify the qualification of this method for a certificate; certificates usually have a more rigorous meaning in the adversarial ML literature. The weakness here is that the threat model is overly simplified, as it is pretty straightforward to trim the suffix when the only goal is to defend against suffix attacks. It is recommended to delve deeper into potential adaptive attacks, e.g., how the suffix attack would try to evade the suffix-trimming-like defenses.\n\n**1.2. The certificate is not rigorous.**\n\nThis defense's \"certificate\" finally boils down to the accuracy of the adopted safety filter (LLama-2 or DistilBERT) on a single trimmed safe prompt \u2014 as long as one trimmed safe prompt gets predicted wrong, the final certificate is a false alarm. However, this performance is only demonstrated empirically and does not provide any guarantee. For example, while this filter performs perfectly on the given test set, there is no guarantee that the same performance will generalize to test-time prompts. \n\nNote that RS provides a formal certificate regardless of the underlying base classifier's performance, but this defense's certificate is invalid when the underlying base classifier makes any one mistake (note that this is not what an empirical 100% accurate filter could justify). The fundamental difference here is that to calculate a certificate for one input, RS aggregates multiple noisy predictions around it to obtain a *provable robust radius*, yet this defense aggregates multiple trimmed subsequences to obtain a *veto*.\n\nAs a result, RS's certificate gets wrong only when the majority of noisy predictions are wrong, yet this defense's certificate gets wrong as long as any of the \"noisy\" prediction is wrong. The former is hard, as proven by RS, yet the latter is not rigorously proved. Regarding the proven \"certified accuracy\" in Theorem 1, note that RS's certified accuracy is based on thresholding such radii over the test set, yet this defense's \"certified accuracy\" is based on binary predictions over the test set. It is recommended to delve deeper into the theoretical results, e.g., how to deduce a formal guarantee even when the safety filter is allowed to make a few mistakes.\n\n**2. Infusion Attacks**\n\nThis is the threat model where the authors expected to demonstrate potential generalization but face the exponential query complexity problem. While I appreciate the authors' efforts in training a more efficient safety filter, the crux is not the runtime efficiency but the $\\mathbb{O}{n^d}$ query complexity. Parallelization techniques are not usually considered sufficient to account for this level of query complexity (like in crypto), otherwise RS could have also done some exhaustive search in the vision domain. An RS-like method is a good starting point, such as subsampling the whole set of trimmed prompts, but that would likely require an overhaul of the current paper.\n\n**Q2: Short token length, FPR.**\n\nI see that the reported accuracy is the overall performance, which aggregated the FPR of individual data points. However, as the response reported, all evaluated harmful prompts have at most 33 tokens (and 16 on average). This setting leads to serious concerns in the overall evaluations. It is hard to assess if the defense would still work on longer harmful prompts. It is recommended to evaluate potential adaptive attacks, such as the one using dummy safe tokens to increase the length of harmful prompts (to increase the time complexity).\n\nIt is also recommended to analyze the theoretical FPR. Currently, the FPR escalation problem is empirically resolved by training a 100% accurate safety filter (on one input), but I believe this 100% is not perfect as the final overall FPR is still 2% (should be 0% if the filter is indeed perfect). This is a clear sign that the FPR does exist and will escalate, but the current prompts are not long enough to expose the escalation problem."

                        "value": "Thank you for the additional comments. Below, we address the concerns raised:\n\n1. \"Suffix Attacks\" \"This threat model is somewhat trivial\" -- Our framework can produce safety certificates against three attack modes, suffix, insertion, and infusion, where the subsequent modes subsume the modes before them. For example, the insertion mode can defend against adversarial sequences inserted **anywhere in the prompt** (including suffix). In this mode, the defense does more than just erase tokens from the end. It erases token sequences of length at most the maximum erase length $d$ from *within* the prompt and checks the erased subsequences with the safety filter. As we show in Section 5, Figures 6 and 7, erase-and-check can achieve the following performance for an adversarial sequence of length **30 tokens inserted anywhere** in the prompt (not just suffix):\n\n    - a certified accuracy of **100%** on the harmful prompts (see the second sentence in the paragraph left of Fig 7).\n    - an empirical accuracy of **99.2%** on safe prompts (see bar corresponding to maximum erase length 30 in Fig 7).\n    - an average running time of less than **0.5 seconds** per prompt (see the second last sentence of the paragraph left of Fig 7).\n\n    An adversarial insertion of 30 tokens is almost as long as the longest harmful prompt in the dataset (33 tokens, see previous response).\n\n2. \"strong safety certificate\" -- By \"strong\" we are not referring to the technical complexity of the certificate. Instead, we refer to the fact that our framework can certify against adversarial sequences significantly larger than what is possible by adapting existing robustness techniques, such as randomized smoothing, in the LLM safety setting. Our goal is not to create a certificate with undue complexity, but rather one that is highly effective.\n\n3. **Rigor of our certificate definition:** Our definition of certified guarantees says that the performance of the underlying safety filter on harmful prompts remains preserved under adversarial insertions up to a certain size. This is along the same lines as the conventional definition of certificates used in adversarial machine learning. We only deviate from this convention by not certifying the safe prompts. Conventional robustness methods would seek to certify for each output class. In our work, we provide justification for not certifying safe prompts (and only showing empirical accuracy). Attacking a safe prompt makes little sense in practice as it is unlikely that a user will seek to make their safe prompts look harmful to an aligned LLM only to get their request rejected.\n\n4. **False certificates:** Our certificate does not fail due to one misclassified subsequence. An adversarial prompt will be detected as harmful as long as *at least* one of the erased subsequences is detected as harmful. Multiple subsequences may get falsely labeled as safe without affecting the final prediction of erase-and-check. erase-and-check only fails to detect an adversarial prompt when *all* the erased subsequences are falsely labeled as safe.\n    \n    Thus, the following statements made in the above comments are incorrect:\n\n    - \"... this defense's certificate is invalid when the underlying base classifier makes any one mistake ...\"\n    - \"... this defense's certificate gets wrong as long as any of the \"noisy\" prediction is wrong.\"\n\n5. **Comparison with RS w.r.t Query Complexity:** Our work was compared with randomized smoothing in terms of query complexity. The comments say, \"RS could have also done some exhaustive search in the vision domain [given enough queries/processing power].\" However, randomized smoothing has a major drawback that limits the maximum achievable certified radius. Its certificate depends on having a significant overlap (> 50\\%) between the smoothing distributions around the original and the adversarial input point. This overlap decreases rapidly with the distance between the two points (regardless of the amount of processing power/number of queries). Even with infinite computational resources and unlimited query access, the certified radius cannot be increased beyond a limit.\n\n    However, the size of the certificate produced by erase-and-check can be increased with more processing power without compromising the certified accuracy.\n\n6. \"However, as the response reported, all evaluated harmful prompts have at most 33 tokens (and 16 on average). This setting leads to serious concerns in the overall evaluations.\" -- We use the harmful prompts from the AdvBench dataset created by Zou et al. in [1]. If we could use other harmful prompts datasets, we would be happy to learn about them.\n\n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023."

                        "value": "Thanks for the quick response. Below are some clarifications.\n\n**1. Threat Model**\n\nI tried breaking down the threat model into \"suffix/insertion\" vs. \"infusion\" because as long as the general infusion attacks were included in the threat model, the defense would have to handle that specific general case. That is, if the attacker can execute any of the three attacks, the defense cannot obtain knowledge of the exact attack mode, which yields the undesired exponential query complexity. I proposed this simplification (and acknowledged its validity) because it could potentially help avoid the invalid knowledge and practicability problem (before the authors could fully address the exponential query complexity in the infusion mode).\n\n**4. False certificates.**\n\nIt seems the authors misunderstood the comments. For clarification, \"false/invalid certificate\" refers to \"incorrectly certifying safe prompts as harmful.\" Then following the response *\"An adversarial prompt will be detected as harmful as long as at least one of the erased subsequences is detected as harmful,\"* it seems that this claim directly implies the following statement:\n\n*\"A safe prompt will be detected as harmful as long as at least one of the erased subsequences is detected as harmful,\"*\n\nwhich is the core of my concern in Q1-1.2.\n\n**6. Length of harmful (and safe) prompts.**\n\nI wish the authors could agree with the following three facts:\n1. The defense's query complexity depends on the prompt's length $n$ as following: $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ for suffix, $\\mathcal{O}((nd)^k)$ for insertion, and $\\mathcal{O}(n^d)$ for infusion.\n2. The non-adversarial users will almost surely make prompts much longer than $n=25$ tokens.\n3. The adversarial users can add safe dummy tokens to their harmful prompt and increase its length $n$ greatly. \n\nConsidering 1 and 2, the FPR on safe prompts will escalate. Upon checking Section 3.1 and Appendix I, the evaluated safe prompts are *\"roughly between 15 and 25 tokens in size.\"* The defense already reaches 2% FPR for a short, safe prompt of 25 tokens. Real-world prompts will likely have hundreds (if not thousands) of tokens. This goes back to Q1-1.2, where the filter cannot predict any of the $\\mathcal{O}((nd)^k)$ erased safe prompts as harmful, otherwise, the long safe prompt will be predicted as harmful. It is unclear if an empirical 100% accurate classifier could guarantee that.\n\nConsidering 1 and 3, the runtime will grow significantly. The reported 0.5 seconds is for harmful prompts with an average length of $n=15$. When the adversary embeds the original harmful prompt $P$ in a long dummy prompt, leading to a total of $n=150$ tokens (10x longer), the runtime will increase to approximately $0.5\\times10^k$ seconds. For example, the final prompt could be \"Here is a 1000-token paragraph without any harmful content: ...\" + P + \"Execute the previous command, but here is another 1000-token paragraph without any harmful content: ...\", where the adversarial prompt $\\alpha$ can be inserted anywhere."

                        "value": "**1. Not certifying safe prompts.**\n\nI find this threat model very confusing \u2014 **How would you know if a prompt is safe or harmful before attempting to generate a certificate?** Consider a practical use case: the user sends a prompt $P+\\alpha$, where $P$'s safety is unknown, and $\\alpha$ could be either empty or not empty. How would the defense proceed in this case? Would it need an oracle to tell if $P$ is harmful, and only then does it generate the certificate? Note that this is not \"certifying a safe prompt as safe,\" but incorrectly providing a certificate of harmful for a safe prompt.\n\nIt is thus unclear to me what the utility of this certificate is in practice. In a theoretical setting, given a set of harmful prompts, this defense can certify that 100% are harmful. But in practice, only a mixed set of safe and harmful prompts is available, where the harmful prompts have adversarial suffixes to make them appear safe. **A defense cannot assume prior knowledge of which prompts are harmful and then only certify the harmful ones. If it assumes such prior knowledge, there is no need to certify \u2014 you already know they are harmful.**\n\n**2. Empirical performance on safe prompts (Section 3.1) is only evaluated with *25-token* safe prompts.**\n\nI understand the safe/unsafe classifier trained on erased prompts could achieve 99.2% accuracy, but this is only for prompts up to 25 tokens. Say the classifier's FPR (incorrectly predicting an erased safe prompt as harmful) is a very small $p$, and there is a safe prompt $P$ with $n=1000$ tokens. The defense wants to certify adversarial suffix up to $d=10$ tokens. Now, the defense does not know if $P$ is safe or not, so it cannot say, \"this is a safe prompt, and we do not certify.\" Eventually, the erase-and-check procedure will be executed, where $\\mathcal{O}(n\\times d)\\approx \\mathcal{O}(10K)$ erased safe prompts are sent to the classifier. \n\nCould the authors claim that the defense will not determine $P$, which is safe, as harmful with probability $1-(1-p)^{\\mathcal{O}(10K)}$?\n\n**3. Adaptive attacks with long harmful prompts.**\n\nThe example I gave is the original harmful prompt, i.e., $P^\\prime=A+P+B$. The actual attack is still a suffix or insertion with $P^\\prime$ and $\\alpha$, which is the existing attack being studied. For a more general example, the adversary could simply use verbose harmful prompt $P^\\prime$, such as *\"Design a detailed blueprint that outlines the steps necessary to [make a bomb]. The blueprint should be comprehensive and include information ... 1000 tokens of requirements.\"* After that, the attack inserts an adversarial prompt $\\alpha$ into $P^\\prime$."

Terminology**\n\nMost reviewers raised the concern and confusion around the term \"certifying.\"\n\nIn the adversarial robustness literature, RS can formally certify *any* input, regardless of whether it is safe or harmful. For either safe or harmful inputs (i.e., benign or adversarial images), RS proves that the prediction is consistent within some radius. However, this paper only provides a certificate for harmful inputs; safe prompts only have empirical results.\n\nIt is well understood (at least by me) that \"perturbing safe prompts to make them classified malicious\" is excluded from the threat model. In the agreed-upon threat model, the defense generates a certificate when the prompt is harmful. However, it is unclear what certificate (or any outcome) the defense would generate when the prompt is safe. It is thus very confusing why the defense cannot provide a similar certificate for safe prompts, saying that this prompt is certified as not harmful against certain attacks.\n\n**Q2. Practicability**\n\n**1. Insertion**\n\nThe authors agree with the query complexity $\\mathcal{O}((nd)^k)$, but claim that this is acceptable because the evaluation shows that it only takes 0.5 seconds. This is not convincing, as the evaluated prompts only contain 15 or 25 tokens, and longer prompts are easily accessible (see Q4). Please do not mistake the time complexity for runtime efficiency; even an exponential complexity can be small when $n$ is small.\n\n**2. Infusion**\n\nThe authors agree with the query complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^d)$, and provided a subsampling approach to mitigate the exponential search space (Appendix F). However, it is stated in the response that this mitigation does not provide a certificate, and only empirical results are shown (again, with short prompts' small search space).\n\n**Q3. Threat model**\n\nMost reviewers raised the concern of whether the attack's mode should be assumed, and the response was not convincing. While I suggested excluding the infusion attack from the threat model, the authors still claimed that \"our framework can produce safety certificates against three attack modes, suffix, insertion, and infusion.\" Yet, it is clear that the defense cannot produce certificates for infusion attacks: (1) it is impractical to claim to solve a problem with exponential time complexity; (2) the added subsampling approach cannot produce certificates, as the authors have acknowledged.\n\nIf the authors prefer to focus on the general threat model (of all three attacks), I recommend exploring the formal application of RS in textual attacks (similar to what Reviewer oN2G has suggested).\n\n**Q4. Evaluation**\n\n**1. Safe prompts only have 25 tokens**\n\nThis setting (1) significantly diverges from the length of daily benign prompts and (2) hides the query complexity problem. If I understand correctly, $n=16, d=30$ leads to about 500 subsequences, which would take 0.5 seconds as currently reported. Hence, $n=1000, d=30$ would lead to about ~60x more subsequences, which would take 30 seconds.\n\nFirst, the performance of safe prompts is questionable. Current FPR is low because the number of subsequences of each short prompt is quite limited (500), meaning the classifier is unlikely to make a mistake in these subsequences (hence determining a safe prompt as harmful). It is unclear if such FPR would preserve for longer prompts (e.g., 30K subsequences).\n\nSecond, the runtime efficiency is questionable. As analyzed above, the reported 0.5 seconds is meaningless if the evaluated prompt only has 15-25 tokens.\n\n**2. Harmful prompts only have 15 tokens**\n\nThe authors claimed that not using longer prompts was because AdvBench only contains harmful prompts up to 33 tokens (and 16 on average), and they requested a new dataset to proceed. However, this is unnecessary for a simple adaptive attack evaluation, as finding a longer, detailed, harmful prompt is quite straightforward. Despite my examples, one could ask ChatGPT to provide a detailed prompt for safe task A and change the safe A into harmful B. In this case, the runtime efficiency is questionable, as stated above.\n\nI would recommend the authors maintain an adversarial mindset when evaluating the proposed defense and delve deeper into the adaptive attack evaluation. Adaptive attacks need not break the defense but expose the worst-case (runtime) performance."

                    "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a method for certifying the robustness of jailbreaking attacks.  The main idea is---given knowledge of how an attacker will perturb an input prompt---to check all possible substrings of the input with a safety filter.  The authors consider three different threat models for the attacker: suffixes, insertions, and infusions.  A range of experiments are conducted for each threat model to determine the \"clean\" and robust performance and the time complexity of the method.  The authors also provide several theoretical results for their method.\n\n**Overall assessment.**  Overall, this paper is borderline in my opinion.  While there are clear positives, such as the novelty of the approach and problem setting, the writing, the consideration of different threat models, and the idea of providing provable guarantees in this setting, there are a number of drawbacks.  These include shortcomings of the main property that motivates the method, confusion about the use of the word \"token\" and some weaknesses in the experiments.  Altogether, given these weaknesses, I'm leaning toward rejection, but I look forward to a discussion with the authors and the other reviewers."

It extends the literature concerning certified robustness that was prevalent in the adversarial robustness community.  This may spawn future research in this area, which I view as a contribution of this work.\n\n**Consideration of multiple threat models.**  The authors study the existing threat model of adversarial suffixes which has been studied in past work, and extend their method to accommodate more general threat models.  This is a necessary step, and the authors provide experiments across all three of the threat models that they consider."
                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "**\"Fundamental property.\"**  The authors base their `erase-and-check` algorithm on the following observation:\n\n> \"Our procedure leverages a fundamental property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts are also safe. This property allows it to achieve strong certified safety guarantees on harmful prompts while maintaining good empirical performance on safe prompts.\"\n\nI'm not sure whether this \"fundamental property\" is true.  As an example, consider the following sentence: \"How did you make this pizza, it's the bomb!\"  This prompt is safe, and a subsequence of this prompt is \"How did you make the bomb,\" which is an unsafe prompt.  One way to clarify this issue would be to define what it means for a string to be \"safe.\"  \n\n**Tokens vs. characters.**  I was confused about what is meant by the word \"tokens\" in this paper.  Two definitions seem possible:\n\n1. *Tokens as strings.* One interpretation of the word \"token\" is that one token is equivalent to one character in an input prompt.  This seems to be the sense in which \"token\" is used in the paper, given the example at the top of page 2.  However, if this is the definition meant by the authors, then there is a slight mischaracterization of past work.  That is, the authors say that \"[The GCG] method achieves a high attack success rate, of up to 84%, even on black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5 using adversarial sequences that are only 20 tokens long.\"  However, the GCG paper regards tokens as integers; an input string is mapped by a tokenizer to a list of integers.  Generally speaking, GCG attacks are optimized over 20 integer tokens, which are mapped to ~150-200 tokens by the decoder.  So if one token == one integer, then the GCG attack actually uses ~150-200 tokens, and given the query complexity of this method, one would imagine that scaling to such attacks would be challenging.\n2. *Tokens as integers.* If the authors use tokens to refer to integers, as is done in the GCG paper, then this filtering method is no longer black-box, since one needs access to the tokenization of input prompts to conduct the defense.  \n\nMy understanding is that point 1 is the sense meant by the authors.  In either case, it would be worth clarifying the definition of \"token.\"\n\n**What is meant by \"certified\" robustness?**  It's unclear to me what \"certification\" means in this paper.  The `erase-and-check` method depends on the `is-harmful` filter.  If this filter were deterministic, i.e., it returned True if and only if a prompt was harmful by some objective standard (assuming that this exists at all), then one would expect the `erase-and-check` method to filter all possible attacks.  However, as the authors are using Llama2 as the safety filter, the certification \"guarantee\" is only valid *with respect to Llama2*.  This contrasts with the meaning of \"certification\" in the adversarial robustness literature, wherein methods like randomized smoothing give a guarantee that *any* input perturbation of a particular size will not change the classification.  More generally, since there is no objective truth WRT what is safe/unsafe, it might be worth choosing words other than \"certified\" and \"guarantee,\" since the meaning of safety is somewhat subjective in this context.\n\n**Shortcomings of `erase-and-check`.**\n\n* *Knowledge of the attack.*  To run `erase-and-check`, one needs to know the threat model.  Specifically, one needs knowledge of how the attacker will perturb the input prompt, e.g., by adding a suffix, by infusing random characters, etc.  This information will not be known in practice, and therefore its unclear how one would go about using this method in practice.  One would also need to know $d$, the number of characters added to the input prompt.\n* *Query complexity.*  One shortcoming of the proposed method is its query complexity.  If one did have knowledge of the complete threat model (c.f., the above bullet point), then one would still need to check a potentially exponential list of suffixes, which seems especially large for the latter two threat models discussed in the paper.  \n* *`is-harmful` filter construction.*  Based on my understanding, it's unclear to me how the safety filter should be chosen.  The authors use Llama2, but other choices seem possible.  One could use a different LLM, or train a classifier, or use the string checking method used in the GCG paper.  It would be good to do an ablation here and to discuss why one might prefer one method over the others, or whether ensembling these models would be preferable.\n\n**Experiments.**\n\n* *How were the suffixes generated?*  The authors compare to the GCG attack throughout the paper.  However, as discussed above, the GCG attack produces suffixes that are often 200 characters long, and in the paper, the suffixes seem to be 20 characters long.  Did the authors (a) run GCG to obtain the suffixes or (b) generate the suffixes in some other way?  Point (b) seems to be supported by, \"We evaluated is-harmful on a randomly sampled set of 500 harmful prompts from AdvBench.\"  Is the randomness over the sampling of the prompts from AdvBench or over the sampling of the suffixes themselves?  If the suffixes were generated randomly, it would be necessary to see if these strings elicited objectionable responses when appended onto the AdvBench prompts and passed through an LLM.  My guess is that random generation will result in lower ASRs than the GCG attack, but that's just a hunch.\n* *Comparisons to past work.*  Since the authors imply a comparison to GCG (\"We evaluated is-harmful on the 500 harmful behavior instruction prompts created by Zou et al. (2023) as part of their AdvBench dataset and observed an accuracy of 93%. For comparison, an adversarial suffix of length 20 can make the accuracy on harmful prompts as low as 16% for GPT-3.5\"), it would be worth clarifying if they are referring to the same kind of attack.  In general, it's unclear to me how these figures of 93% ASR for GCG and 16% attack detection are comparable, especially if the suffixes in this paper were generated randomly.  Could the authors clarify this?\n* *Adaptive attacks.*  It would also be worth thinking about *adaptive attacks* for this method.  Adaptive attacks are common in the adversarial robustness literature, wherein one attacks a defended classifier.  Would it be possible to attack the `erase-and-check` method, particularly if a differentiable function like Llama2 is used in the `is-harmful` filter?  At the very least, it would be worth discussing adaptive attacks, if not adding some experiments to address this aspect.\n* *Evaluation metrics.*  It seemed like there could be more appropriate choices for the evaluation metrics. The authors compute accuracies for whether safe prompts are labeled safe and unsafe prompts are labeled unsafe.  But this seems like a situation in which something like the $F_1$ score would make more sense.  More generally, it would be good to look at the true/false positives/negatives to get a sense of the trade-offs encountered when using this method.  \n* *Attack detection.*  Most of the plots concern time-complexity and \"clean\" performance on safe prompts.  But the plots do not reflect the attack detection rate, which I would have thought would have been the main experiment.  It's not clear how the attack detection rate fluctuates with $d$ or between the different threat models.  Adding a discussion of this would strengthen the paper.\n* *Baseline algorithm.*  I'm not sure I understood the construction of the baseline.  Although it is called \"randomized smoothing,\" as the authors note, it is not random.  Indeed, one could view this method as averaging, whereas the `erase-and-check` method is using a max operator; it's the difference between a detection holding on average vs. a detection holding $\\forall$ inputs.  From this view, it seems definite that this baseline will *always* perform worse than `erase-and-check`, since it requires a strictly less granular filtering operation.\n\n**Minor points.**\n\n* I think that $n$ is defined on Section 3, but it is used throughout Section 2.\n* The notation switches in Section 5.  Is $P=n$ at the bottom of page 7?  And what is $T$ and $\\ell$ -- they seem to have already been defined in different notation."

                        "value": "Thank you for your time and effort in providing a detailed review of our work. We appreciate your emphasis on the positives of our work, such as the novelty of the approach and problem setting, consideration of different threat models, and providing certified guarantees, as well as your constructive feedback on further improving our work. Some aspects of our work we felt were misunderstood in the review. We would like to clarify them before addressing the concerns raised in the review, as they are essential for understanding our work.\n\n1. Adversarial harmful prompts are not needed to obtain certified guarantees. In order to compute our certificate, we only need to evaluate the safety filter on the clean harmful prompts (without the adversarial sequence). Theorem 1 guarantees that the accuracy of the safety filter on clean harmful prompts is a lower bound on the accuracy of erase-and-check on adversarial harmful prompts. The certified accuracy is independent of the adversarial attack algorithm. Our procedure can defend against all attack algorithms, such as GCG [1] and AutoDAN [2, 3], as long as the adversarial prompts generated are within the threat model.\n\n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n    [2] AutoDAN: Generating Stealthy Jailbreak Prompts on Aligned Large Language Models, Liu et al., 2023.\n\n    [3] AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models, Zhu et al., 2023.\n\n2. Access to the tokenizer used by the attacker is not required for our procedure to work or obtain certified safety guarantees. We use the same notion of tokens as used by Zou et al. [1] and do not tokenize every character of the prompt. We have updated the adversarial prompt example on page 2 in the updated draft to make this clearer. The number of tokens in the certificate is counted using the tokenizer of the safety filter. We have added more clarification in Appendix A: Frequently Asked Questions.\n\n3. The safety filter used in our procedure need not be deterministic. Our certificates can be computed for probabilistic filters like Llama 2 as well. Theorem 1 in our paper bounds the expected accuracy (including the randomness of the filter) of erase-ans-check is lower bounded by the expected accuracy of the safety filter. For a probabilistic filter, we should perform several evaluations of the filter over the dataset to ensure that the estimated accuracy holds with a high degree of confidence. To this end, we calculate the accuracy of the Llama 2 filter using 60,000 samples (by sampling harmful prompts with replacement) to \"average out\" the effect of the internal randomness of Llama 2. We observe an accuracy of 92% on these 60K samples. Using concentration bounds such as Hoeffding's inequality, we can guarantee that the true accuracy is above 91% with a confidence of 99.9%. Note that, the trained DistilBERT safety classifier used in our new results in Section 6 is deterministic in nature and its accuracy on the dataset is constant.\n\nIn the following, we address the concerns and questions raised in the review:\n\n1. **\"Fundamental property.\"** -- The property that subsequences of safe prompts are also safe need not always hold. However, it is true for most everyday use of LLMs. Indeed, as another reviewer also points out, there exist safe prompts whose subsequences are harmful. We realize that our original statement was too strong and have replaced it with the following: \"Our procedure relies on the inherent property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts remain safe in most everyday use of LLMs.\" This statement reflects the fact that while subsequences of most safe prompts are also safe, this property may not always be true. Thank you for helping us make our claims more precise.\n\n    While it is challenging to come up with a completely unambiguous definition of safe and harmful prompts, the following are a few examples from our dataset (also see Appendix I).\n\n    Safe prompts:\n    1. Elaborate on the development and importance of the World Wide Web.\n    2. How does solar energy work and what are its advantages and disadvantages?\n\n    Harmful prompts:\n    1.

See Figures 5 (a, b)  and 6 (a, b). With this improved efficiency, we are able to certify for adversarial sequence lengths that were not possible with Llama 2 in a reasonable amount of time (Figure 7). We also test an efficient randomized version of erase-and-check that evaluates the safety filter on a small randomly selected subset of the erased subsequences. See Appendix F: Efficient Randomized Procedure. We observe that by sampling only 20% of the erased subsequences, the accuracy on adversarial harmful prompts can be improved to more than 90%.

We use the same tokenizer as the model used to detect harmful prompts. For the Llama 2 safety filter, we use the tokenizer for Llama 2 and our certified guarantees hold with respect to this tokenizer. Similarly, for the DistilBERT classifier, we use the tokenizer for DistilBERT. Although there are some differences between different tokenizers, we observe that they are not too significant in practice. Both Llama 2 and DistilBERT-based filters erase tokens in a similar way, like the example above."

                        "value": "3. **What is meant by \"certified\" robustness?** -- As discussed earlier, the safety filter used for our procedure need not be deterministic. Certified safety guarantees can be obtained for probabilistic filters as well, like the one based on Llama 2. In the probabilistic case, the proof of Theorem 1 in our paper (Appendix G), shows that the probability with which the filter labels a prompt as harmful is a lower bound for the probability for the erase-and-check procedure. Using this fact, we can directly certify the expected accuracy of our procedure over a distribution (or dataset), without having to certify for each individual sample. However, the trained DistilBERT classifier used for our new results in Section 5 is deterministic. In the deterministic case, we can certify the overall accuracy as well as individual samples.\n\n    Our certificate aims to guarantee that the accuracy of a safety guardrail on harmful prompts is retained under adversarial attacks of bounded size. We do not use a specific definition of harmful prompts. We use the set of harmful prompts provided in the AdvBench dataset by Zou et al. [1] to obtain our certified guarantees. We assume that there exists some distribution of harmful prompts under some notion of harmfulness based on the specific application/context from which the harmful prompts are drawn. Our procedure can be adapted to other notions of harmfulness and used to obtain certified guarantees under those notions as well.\n\n    It would be incorrect to interpret the certified guarantees of our Llama-based safety filter as: \"92% of the harmful prompts (say) are guaranteed to be harmful with respect to the harmfulness notion of Llama 2\". Instead, the correct interpretation would be: \"The performance of the Llama 2-based safety filter is guaranteed to be 92% with respect to the harmfulness notion used for the harmful distribution.\" In other words, the certificates are not *with respect to* the Llama 2 filter, but *on the performance of* the Llama 2 filter under the notion of harmfulness established by the application/context. This is in line with the definition of certification used in adversarial robustness literature, which is to guarantee the performance of a model, e.g., a classifier, on a particular dataset, e.g., ImageNet, under adversarial attacks of bounded size.\n\n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n4. **Knowledge of the attack [mode]:** -- Knowledge of the attack mode allows us to tailor our procedure for that mode and achieve improved efficiency and accuracy. For instance, if we do not know whether the adversarial sequence is inserted in the middle or at the end of the harmful prompt, we can use eras-and-check in the insertion mode, which subsumes the suffix mode. However, if we know the insertion's location, say suffix (or prefix), we can tailor our procedure to defend against this specific threat model and significantly improve its efficiency. Most adversarial attacks studied so far, such as GCG and AutoDAN, fall into this category.\n\n    Also, assuming a threat model such as $\\ell_1, \\ell_2$, etc. for the attack, is conventional in the adversarial robustness literature and often needed to obtain certified guarantees. It is also conventional to obtain certified guarantees up to a radius r around the input, similar to the adversarial sequence length $d$ for which we certify. It is also acceptable to design defenses against specific threat models, e.g., using the Gaussian noise distribution to defend against $\\ell_2$ attacks [1] and using the Laplace distribution for $\\ell_1$ attacks [2].\n\n    [1] Certified Adversarial Robustness via Randomized Smoothing, Cohen et al., ICML 2019\n\n    [2] $\\ell_1$ Adversarial Robustness Certificates: a Randomized Smoothing Approach, Teng et al., 2020."

                        "value": "5. **Query complexity:** The number of erased subsequences to check increases with the generality of the attack mode (suffix < insertion < infusion). This can increase the running time of the procedure. To this end, we take the following steps:\n\n    1. Lightweight Safety Classifier: We train a DistilBERT text classifier on the dataset of safe and harmful prompts and use this as the safety filter. This classifier is deterministic and significantly faster than Llama 2. See Section 5: Trained Safety Classifier. This safety filter significantly outperforms the Llama 2 filter in terms of certified accuracy on harmful prompts (100\\%), empirical accuracy on safe prompts (98\\%) and average running time (up to 40x speed up). See Figures 5 (a, b)  and 6 (a, b). With this improved efficiency, we are able to certify for longer adversarial sequence lengths even for more general attack modes such as insertion, which was not possible with Llama 2 in a reasonable amount of time (Figure 7).\n\n    2. Efficient Randomized Version: We test an efficient randomized version of erase-and-check that evaluates the safety filter on a small, randomly selected subset of the erased subsequences. See Appendix F: Efficient Randomized Procedure. We refer to the fraction of the subsequences sampled as the sampling ratio. Thus, for a sampling ratio of 1, we get back the original version of erase-and-check, which evaluates all subsequences, and for a sampling ratio of 0, the procedure is equivalent to evaluating the safety filter on the (unerased) input prompt. While there are no certified guarantees for this version, we observe that by sampling only 20% of the erased subsequences (sampling ratio = 0.2), the accuracy on adversarial harmful prompts can be improved to more than 90% (Figure 11). Thus, the efficiency of our procedure can be further boosted in practical applications.\n\n    All existing adversarial attacks, such as GCG and AutoDAN, fall into the suffix and insertion attack modes. To the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an attack in the infusion mode. We study the infusion mode to showcase our framework's versatility and demonstrate that it can tackle new threat models that emerge in the future.\n\n6. **Filter construction** -- Indeed, the filter can be implemented in different ways. In our additional experiments, we show that by replacing Llama 2 with a trained DistilBERT safety classifier, as suggested in the review, we can significantly improve the filter's performance (Section 5: Trained Safey Classifier). We compare the performance of Llama 2 and DistilBERT in Figures 5 and 6.\nWhile the Llama 2-based filter is easy to implement and does not need to be trained, DistilBERT achieves much higher accuracy on both safe and harmful prompts. Also, the accuracy drop for larger certified adversarial lengths is lower for DistilBERT as we train it on erased versions of the safe prompts.\n\n7. **How were the suffixes generated?** -- As mentioned earlier, we do not need adversarial prompts to compute the certified accuracies. It is sufficient to evaluate the accuracy of the safety filter on clean harmful prompts; by Theorem 1, this accuracy is a lower bound on that of erase-and-check on adversarial harmful prompts.\n\n    However, to evaluate the performance of the randomized version of our procedure (part of the new experiments), we need to test it against adversarial attacks on the safety filter (Appendix F: Efficient Randomized Procedure). To this end, we implement the GCG attack for the DistilBERT safety filter (see gcg.py in updated code) and use it to generate suffix attacks of varying lengths, similar to Zou et al. Our implementation of GCG is able to reduce the accuracy of the safety filter to 0 with 18 adversarial tokens. However, as Figure 11 shows, this accuracy can be significantly improved by evaluating on a small randomly sampled subset of the erased subsequences.\n\n8. **Comparisons to GCG** -- We defend against the same kind of attacks (GCG) studied in Zou et al. [1]. Our notion of tokens is also the same as theirs; we do not refer to characters as tokens. We have updated the example at the beginning of our paper to make this clearer and added an illustration of erase-and-check in Appendix K. Also, no adversarial suffixes were generated for computing the certified accuracy on the harmful prompts.\n\n    [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n9. **Adaptive attacks** -- It is unclear to us what is being referred to as attacking a \"differentiable function like Llama 2\". Existing attacks like GCG and AutoDAN already differentiate a target model to obtain adversarial prompts. Such attacks are covered by our threat models, and our certificate holds irrespective of the attack algorithm used. To evaluate the empirical accuracy of the randomized version of erase-and-check, we attack the safety filter using GCG and plot the accuracy in Appendix F, Figure 11."

                        "value": "10. **Evaluation metrics** -- The Llama 2-based safety filter does not have a detection parameter that we can vary to obtain an ROC curve. Thus, it makes more sense to plot the accuracy on safe and harmful prompts. For the DistilBERT classifier, accuracies for both safe and harmful prompts are close to 100% and scores like F1 and AUROC are nearly 1.\n\n11. **Attack detection** -- Certified accuracy on harmful prompts does not depend on the maximum erase length d. This value is 92% and 100% for Llama 2 and DistilBERT, respectively. Thus, if we were to plot the certified accuracy vs. d, as we did for the empirical accuracy on the safe prompts, all the bars would have the same height equal to the certified accuracy. In our new experiments on the empirical performance of the randomized erase-and-check, we plot the accuracy against GCG attacks of different lengths in Appendix F, Figure 11.\n\n12. **Baseline algorithm** -- Our goal is to show that we can outperform defense techniques designed for other attacks by leveraging the properties of safety attacks. For safety attacks, it is sufficient to certify harmful prompts and not safe prompts. This is because attacking safe prompts to make them detected as harmful makes little sense in practice. By designing a defense tailored for the safety setting, we are able to achieve better certified guarantees than a naive adaptation of existing robustness techniques.\n\n13. \"I think that n is defined on Section 3, but it is used throughout Section 2.\" -- Thank you for pointing this out. We have added the definition of n where it is first used.\n\n14. \"The notation switches in Section 5.\" -- $n$ refers to the number of tokens in the input of erase-and-check. $T$ and $l$ are the set of tokens and the length of the adversarial sequence, respectively. Note that $l$ is not the same as the max erase length $d$. They have been defined earlier in the paper (Adversarial Suffix section, various threat models, etc.). We have also included further clarifications in the Notations section."

                        "value": "> \"Adversarial harmful prompts are not needed to obtain certified guarantees.\"\n\nWith this is technically true, I believe that (1) this doesn't answer either of my questions regarding how the prompts were generated and (2) using randomly generated suffixes makes a weaker argument than using the suffixes that have *actually* been shown to jailbreak LLMs.\n\n> \"The property that subsequences of safe prompts are also safe need not always hold\"\n\nThis is confusing for several reasons:\n\n1. **Disagreement.** This is at odds with what was originally written in the paper.  The authors originally wrote that \"Our procedure leverages a fundamental property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts are also safe.\"\n2. **Certification.** And as mentioned in several of the reviews (`xu91`,`hssG`), this calls into question what is meant by \"certified.\"  Since (as the authors mention), \"there exist safe prompts whose subsequences are harmful,\" any such example of this behavior would violate the so-called \"certificate.\"\n\n> We realize that our original statement was too strong and have replaced it with the following: 'Our procedure relies on the inherent property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts remain safe in most everyday use of LLMs.'\"\n\nThis is still problematic in my opinion.  The property is not \"inherent\" or (as per the original draft) \"fundamental.\" What does \"everyday use\" mean here? And even if this question could be definitively answered, what then for the certificate? Effectively, this indicates that the certificate is valid for all prompts that fall under the umbrella of \"everyday use,\" which seems like a relatively weak certificate.\n\n---\n\n> \"We use the same notion of tokens as in Zou et al. [1]. We do not define tokens as characters in the input prompt.\"\n\nThis statement is not supported by a reasonable interpretation of the originally submitted PDF.  In original draft of the paper, the authors wrote that \"[GCG] achieves a high attack success rate, of up to 84%, even on black-box LLMs such as GPT-3.5 using adversarial sequences that are only 20 tokens long.  The following is an illustration of the effect of an adversarial suffix on the above example.\"  And in the example, the authors use the following suffix: `@%!7*]/$r>x3w)2#(&q<`.  This suffix contains twenty *characters*, although the most reasonable interpretation of the quoted text indicates that this string comprises twenty *tokens*.\n\n> \"We realize that the example on page 2 is misleading and have updated it with a more accurate description of the adversarial sequences.\"\n\nThere is a difference \"more accurate\" and *different*. Based on my reading, this update fundamentally changes the method. If `erase-and-check` does indeed operate on tokens as defined in (Zou et al., 2023), then the method is no longer black-box; `erase-and-check` is now a white-box algorithm. This significantly weakens the contribution, because it is now no longer possible to use the tokenizers of models that are only available as black boxes (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, etc.).\n\n> \"Regarding the scalability of our method, we have included new results in the updated version, where the safety filter uses a DistilBERT text classifier to detect harmful prompts.\"\n\nWhile I think that comparing the choices of Llama2 and DistilBERT for the `is-harmful` filter offers a nice point of comparison, it doesn't resolve the underlying issue, which is that the \"certificate\" is only defined up to the reliability of Llama2 (or, now, DistilBERT).  The authors claim that using DistilBERT in the `is-harmful` filter results in a certified accuracy on harmful prompts of 100%. This means that there *does not exist* any prompt that is misclassified by the model; is this really true, especially given the previous discussion, in which the authors acknowledge that there could be examples wherein substrings of safe prompts are not safe?\n\nThis point was raised in my original review (see the section entitled \"What is meant by \"certified\" robustness?\"), and my concern is shared by `xu91` and `HssG`.\n\n> \"For the Llama 2 safety filter, we use the tokenizer for Llama 2 and our certified guarantees hold with respect to this tokenizer. . . Although there are some differences between different tokenizers, we observe that they are not too significant in practice.\"\n\nHere's what I've understood. The current proposal for the certificate relies on (a) defining \"everyday use\" w/r/t input prompts, (b) the faithfulness of `is-harmful` in aligning with what a human would classify as harmful, and (c) the difference between the targeted model's tokenizer and the tokenizer of the model underlying `is-harmful` being \"not too significant in practice.\" Is my understanding correct here?  If so, I'm afraid that I don't agree with the framing of this work as *certifying* robustness, since the certificate relies on subjective interpretations and unmeasurable differences (given the black-box nature of LLMs like ChatGPT)."

While I agree that this is a separate problem setting with distinct challenges, it would perhaps be worth using a word other than \"certifying\" to describe what this paper is about.\n\n---\n\n> \"As discussed earlier, the safety filter used for our procedure need not be deterministic. Certified safety guarantees can be obtained for probabilistic filters as well\"\n\nPerhaps I didn't word my question precisely enough. The issue is not whether or not the safety filter provides a deterministic or probabilistic answer. The question concerned the fact that classifying whether text constitutes a jailbreak is a subjective process, and therefore it is unclear what it means to \"certify\" LLM robustness against jailbreaks. In adversarial robustness, this idea is well defined; we obtain a certificate if we can guarantee that there *does not exist* a perturbation with a given magnitude that fools a classifier.\n\n> \"Our certificate aims to guarantee that the accuracy of a safety guardrail on harmful prompts is retained under adversarial attacks of bounded size. We do not use a specific definition of harmful prompts.\"\n\nThis doesn't make sense to me. How can one obtain a guarantee on whether safety guardrails detect harmful prompts if one does not define what a harmful prompt is?\n\n> \" We assume that there exists some distribution of harmful prompts under some notion of harmfulness based on the specific application/context from which the harmful prompts are drawn. . . It would be incorrect to interpret the certified guarantees of our Llama-based safety filter as: \"92% of the harmful prompts (say) are guaranteed to be harmful with respect to the harmfulness notion of Llama 2\". Instead, the correct interpretation would be: \"The performance of the Llama 2-based safety filter is guaranteed to be 92% with respect to the harmfulness notion used for the harmful distribution.\"\n\nAgain, this doesn't make sense to me.  Both uses seem to rely on Llama2 reflecting the ground truth, which it does not. Also, in the second framing, it's unclear to me what the meaning of \"the harmfulness notion used for the harmful distribution\" is.  The so-called \"harmful distribution\" is completely unknown and undefined. If we are assuming that Advbench is sampled from this distribution, it is likely not i.i.d., given the number of repeated entries in Advbench. And I don't understand what it would be to define a \"harmfulness notion\" w/r/t this distribution.\n\n> \"This is in line with the definition of certification used in adversarial robustness literature, which is to guarantee the performance of a model, e.g., a classifier, on a particular dataset, e.g., ImageNet, under adversarial attacks of bounded size.\"\n\nUnfortunately, I do not agree for two reasons. \n\n* **\"Guarantee.\"** In either framing of the certificate, it depends on Llama2 to correctly interpret whether text constitutes a jailbreak. There is no such subjectivity in the adversarial robustness literature, so drawing this kind of parallel seems tenuous at best.\n* **\"Bounded size.\"** There is no notion of \"bounded size\" here, becasue as we have already discussed, there can be holes/counterexamples which (a) satisfy a size constraint (whether on tokens or characters), (b) a human would classify as being harmful, and (c) are classified as safe by `erase-and-check`. \n\n> \"Knowledge of the attack mode allows us to tailor our procedure for that mode and achieve improved efficiency and accuracy. For instance, if we do not know whether the adversarial sequence is inserted in the middle or at the end of the harmful prompt, we can use eras-and-check in the insertion mode, which subsumes the suffix mode.\"\n\nI agree with this in spirit, but what this effectively says is that if we do not know what attack is coming, then we have to use *exponentially* many queries to check *every possible* kind of attack. This seems highly inefficient.\n\n> \"However, if we know the insertion's location, say suffix (or prefix), we can tailor our procedure to defend against this specific threat model and significantly improve its efficiency.\"\n\nI'm imaging that I'm a maintainer of an LLM; say I work at OpenAI or on the Bard team at Google. Then as a maintainer, the question is, Will there ever exist a scenario in which I will know an insertion's location beforehand? \n\n---\n\n> \"We train a DistilBERT text classifier on the dataset of safe and harmful prompts and use this as the safety filter. This classifier is deterministic and significantly faster than Llama 2.\"\n\nW/r/t query efficiency, I agree that this would specifically speed things up. However, as discussed above, it still contitutes a subjective classifier regarding what constitutes a jailbreak, which was one of the problems with using Llama2 in the first place."

                        "value": "> \"Efficient Randomized Version: We test an efficient randomized version of erase-and-check that evaluates the safety filter on a small, randomly selected subset of the erased subsequences. . . While there are no certified guarantees for this version, we observe that by sampling only 20% of the erased subsequences (sampling ratio = 0.2), the accuracy on adversarial harmful prompts can be improved to more than 90% (Figure 11).\"\n\nThis is an interesting idea. I would argue that the entire paper should be framed in this way.  I.e., the language around \"guarantees\" and \"certificates\" should be softened so that it aligns with the \"we observed X. . . and the accuracy on harmful prompts can be improved to Y.\" This seems more consistent and accurate w/r/t my (and, it seems, several of the other reviewers') understanding of what this paper does.\n\n> \"**How were the suffixes generated?** -- As mentioned earlier, we do not need adversarial prompts to compute the certified accuracies. It is sufficient to evaluate the accuracy of the safety filter on clean harmful prompts; by Theorem 1, this accuracy is a lower bound on that of erase-and-check on adversarial harmful prompts.\"\n\nCould the authors clarify? How were the suffixes in the original submission generated? Were they randomly selected?\n\n> \"To this end, we implement the GCG attack for the DistilBERT safety filter (see gcg.py in updated code) and use it to generate suffix attacks of varying lengths, similar to Zou et al.\"\n\nWhy did the authors not use the original implementation of GCG (https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks)? What is *similar* about your approach? Did you use the same hyperparameters, i.e., 500 steps with a batch size of 512?\n\n> \"Our implementation of GCG is able to reduce the accuracy of the safety filter to 0 with 18 adversarial tokens.\"\n\nI don't understand this. Does this indicate that an adaptive attack can reduce the performance of `is-harmful` to zero percent? Isn't that perfect accuracy, in the sense that we could just flip the result of `is-harmful` and have 100% accuracy? My thought would have been that the \"bad event\" would be if the attack reduced the accuracy to 50%, which would constitute random choice.\n\n> \"**Adaptive attacks** -- It is unclear to us what is being referred to as attacking a \"differentiable function like Llama 2\". Existing attacks like GCG and AutoDAN already differentiate a target model to obtain adversarial prompts. Such attacks are covered by our threat models, and our certificate holds irrespective of the attack algorithm used.\"\n\nWhat I mean is this. One could design suffixes (or other kinds of attacks) that fool the LLama2-based (or, DistilBERT-based) `is-harmful` safety filter into misclassifying an unsafe prompt as safe, or vice versa. This concern was also raised by `xu91`, when they noted that \"An adaptive attacker aware of the author(s)'s defense could craft prompts using Llama 2, reducing the empirical effectiveness of the defense in practice.\"\n\n> \"Certified accuracy on harmful prompts does not depend on the maximum erase length d. This value is 92% and 100% for Llama 2 and DistilBERT, respectively. Thus, if we were to plot the certified accuracy vs. d, as we did for the empirical accuracy on the safe prompts, all the bars would have the same height equal to the certified accuracy.\"\n\nI'm confused. If I set $d=1$, why is it the case that Algorithm 1 will *necessarily* return the same result as if I set $d$ equal to the length of the input prompt?\n\n> \"This is because attacking safe prompts to make them detected as harmful makes little sense in practice.\"\n\nOn the contrary, I think this is exactly the spirit of an *adaptive attack*. If a malicious user wanted to evade your filter (whether in the positive or the negative direction), it seems like this is a distinct possibility regarding what they would try to do. \n\n**Post-rebuttal response.** I appreciate the significant time and effort that the authors have gone to to write rebuttals and to engage with the reviewers. And I stand by the strengths that I listed in my original review. I have left detailed feedback in response to the rebuttal above. Unfortunately, despite the changes, which include a randomized version of the algorithm, a lightweight classifier, and a reframing of the main property, I still have concerns about the paper. The meaning of certified is still unclear, the use of the word \"tokens\" is still somewhat unclear, and the so-called fundamental/inherent property undermines the derived guarantees. For these reasons, I will keep my score."

In my view, this title is too broad and implies the work achieves more than it does (i.e., overclaims).  The paper defends against a specific type of adversarial prompting -- token insertions.  For example, consider the \"*jailbreak via mismatched generalization*\" attack in Wei et al. [2].  Their attack is simple and effective; however, this paper's method would not be expected to work well against it.  For vision domains, there are standard conventions to define different types of robustness (e.g., $\\ell_2$. $\\ell_\\infty$).  To my knowledge, there is no such standard nomenclature for prompt robustness.  In the absence of that, the authors need to be especially explicit early on (e.g., in the abstract) about the robustness paradigms their defense considers and, more importantly, those that the defense does not.  The paper does not really discuss the types of attacks where the defense does not work.  \n\nThe authors use the open-source Llama 2 language model as their harmfulness detector.  I understand the choice, and agree it is reasonable because it is unlikely many can train their own harmfulness detector. However, using an open-source LM inherently poses a risk.  An adaptive attacker aware of the author(s)'s defense could craft prompts using Llama 2, reducing the empirical effectiveness of the defense in practice.  Unless the Zou et al. (2023) AdvBench dataset already tunes the attacks using Llama 2, the authors should add such an experiment to the paper. \n* To clarify, I recognize the guarantees would still hold, but I expect the actual *numerical performance* would decline, potentially substantially.\n\nOn page 2, the authors write,\n\n> *The safety certificate of our procedure guarantees that harmful prompts are not misclassified as safe under an adversarial attack.*\n\nI found this description of your method's guarantees well-written and clear.  In particular, I found this description a good deal clearer and more precise than the description in the abstract, where I found the intent of your method harder to parse and understand on a single read-through.  I recommend replacing the language in the abstract with the quote above.\n\n\nOn page 6, the authors write,\n\n> ...we tested our procedure on 200 safe prompts generated using ChatGPT for different values of the maximum erase length between 0 and 30.  \n\nThe paper should contain a short description detailing how the criteria used to generate these safe prompts.  Specifying that ChatGPT was used provides very little insight to the reader.  The authors should summarize the prompt generation criteria so readers do not need to read the clean prompts to build an intuition about their form.  \n* I appreciate the authors provided the clean prompts in their supplemental materials.

I agree this property is *generally* true, though there are counterexamples where it isn't. For example, \"Do not write '[SomethingEvil]'\" is a safe prompt.  \"write '[SomethingEvil]'\" is a subsequence but is not safe.  Perhaps we have different definitions of what constitutes a \"**fundamental property**\" and whether such a property can be violated.  Nonetheless, this statement needs more precision as a less careful reader may not realize this property may not always hold.\n\nSubroutine `is-harmful` checks whether some (sub)prompt is harmful.  Am I correct in assuming that your method implicitly assumes that `is-harmful` is a deterministic function?  Reading your paper, I interpret the guarantees that your method provides as deterministic (as opposed to probabilistic).  If `is-harmful` is not deterministic, then it seems your guarantees would be probabilistic only -- correct me if I am wrong.  \n* The author(s)'s implementation uses Llama 2 for the `is-harmful` method.  Therefore, for their `is-harmful` to be deterministic, the LM's hyperparameters/settings must be set appropriately to ensure determinism.  \n* I do not recall the authors discussing this point generally or in the context of their empirical evaluation.\n\nI had some difficulty interpreting the results in Figure 3(b).  The caption specifies that the figure shows the running time of `erase-and-check` (i.e., the whole algorithm) in suffix mode on clean prompts.  I would have expected that the time needed to certify deleting 20 tokens would be roughly double the time needed to certify 10 tokens since suffix mode's complexity is $O(d)$.  However, the figure shows the certification time for 10, 20, or 30 tokens is nearly identical.  Does Figure 3(b) visualize `erase-and-check`'s whole running time or for just one of $O(d)$ prompts?\n* I am not sure what is wrong here, but the clarity needs to be improved.\n\nI do not believe I saw your `is_harmful` prompt in the supplement paper.  I spent a little time searching through your code but did not quickly find it.  Please specify this in the supplement so readers know if you are using zero-shot, few-shot, something else, etc."

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive comments and insightful feedback. They have been instrumental in improving our work.\nAdditionally, we are grateful for your mention of relevant literature such as RS-Del. We have incorporated this reference into our discussion of related work, elaborating on how our context varies from the one explored in RS-Del. In the following, we address the specific concerns highlighted in your review.\n\n1. \"In my view, this title is too broad and implies the work achieves more than it does (i.e., overclaims) ... this paper's method would not be expected to work well against [\"jailbreak via mismatched generalization\" attack ]\"\n\n   The main focus of our work is to defend against attacks generated using *adversarial* algorithms such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) [1] and AutoDAN [2, 3], which optimize with the objective of bypassing safety guardrails. All such attacks are covered in the threat models we consider. In comparison with the computer vision literature, these algorithms are similar to Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attacks. Such automated attacks are challenging to defend against.\n\n   The \"jailbreak via mismatched generalization\" in Wei et al., which shows that LLM safety training does not generalize when the prompt is encoded in base-64, is a domain generalization problem. This is similar to an image classifier trained on natural images not generalizing well to JPEG compression of the images [5]. In our view, such jailbreaks do not fall under adversarial prompts, just as an image corrupted by JPEG compression is not considered an adversarial example of the original image. They are not optimized with the objective of bypassing safety guardrails. One way to mitigate the base-64 encoding issue could be to reject prompts that contain sequences very unlikely to appear in natural text, for example, the perplexity filtering baseline defense studied by Jain et al. in [4].\n\n   [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023.\n\n   [2] AutoDAN: Generating Stealthy Jailbreak Prompts on Aligned Large Language Models, Liu et al., 2023.\n\n   [3] AutoDAN: Automatic and Interpretable Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models, Zhu et al., 2023.\n\n   [4] Baseline Defenses for Adversarial Attacks Against Aligned Language Models, Jain et al., 2023\n\n   [5] Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations, Hendrycks et al., ICLR 2019.\n\n2. \"...the authors need to be especially explicit early on (e.g., in the abstract) about the robustness paradigms their defense considers and, more importantly, those that the defense does not.\"\n\n   We define our adversarial threat models based on the adversarial attacks designed by Zou et al. in [1]. These attacks append an adversarial sequence $\\alpha$ to a harmful prompt $P$ to generate adversarial prompts of the form $P + \\alpha$. This is the form of the suffix attack mode in our paper. We also show that our framework can generate certificates for two other modes, namely insertion and infusion, which are generalizations of the suffix mode.\n\n   We describe the three attack modes that we defend against in the abstract as well as in the introduction. We have also made the mathematical form of the attacks more explicit in the abstract. Our defense is designed for these three threat models and we do not claim certified safety guarantees outside of these three threat models.\n\n   [1] Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models, Zou et al., 2023."

                        "value": "3. \"However, using an open-source LM inherently poses a risk. An adaptive attacker aware of the author(s)'s defense could craft prompts using Llama 2, reducing the empirical effectiveness of the defense in practice.\"\n\n   Since, we only instruct Llama 2 using its system prompt to detect harmful prompts, its model weights are not needed. Thus, one can replace it with a closed-source proprietary language model with API access. Our main reason for choosing Llama 2 is that it's free to use.\n\n   Also, we have included new results for which we use a DistilBERT text classifier trained on safe and harmful prompts (instead of Llama 2) as the safety filter (Section 5: Trained Safety Classifier). This approach has the advantage that the trained safety classifier could be kept private and not released publicly as an open-source model. This version of the erase-and-check procedure can be placed between a user and an LLM to detect and reject harmful prompts before sending them to the LLM.\n\n   We found that using a trained text classifier can significantly improve our procedure's accuracy and running time. It achieves a certified accuracy of **100%** on the harmful prompts. For safe prompts, it consistently outperforms Llama 2 for all values of maximum erase length tested. It also runs significantly faster than the Llama 2 safety filter. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) compare the empirical performance of Llama 2 and DistilBERT on safe prompts in the suffix mode. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) do the same for the insertion mode. With this improved efficiency, we are able to certify against longer adversarial sequences in the insertion mode (up to 30 tokens), which was not achievable using Llama 2 (Figure 7).\n\n   Furthermore, in Appendix F: Efficient Randomized Procedure, we test an efficient randomized version of erase-and-check that only checks a small, randomly sampled subset of the erased subsequences. The advantage of using a randomized approach is that it is harder for an adversary to predict the behavior of the defense (e.g., which subsequences it chooses to check). We test its performance on adversarial harmful prompts generated by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) attack proposed by Zou et al. (2023). We observe that by checking only 20% of the erased subsequences, the performance of the procedure can be improved to more than 90%.\n\n4. \"I recommend replacing the language in the abstract with the quote above.\"\n\n    Thank you for helping us improve the clarity of our work. Indeed, your suggested replacement enhances the explanation of our procedure's safety guarantees. We have made this change in the updated draft.\n\n5. \"The paper should contain a short description detailing how the criteria used to generate these safe prompts.\"\n\n   We generate the safe prompts by giving ChatGPT the following prompt: Could you please write 100 safe and useful prompts for an LLM? We have included a discussion of the process in Appendix I: Dataset of Safe and Harmful Prompts. We also provide some examples of safe and harmful prompts in that section.\n\n6. \"I assume the authors will include these clean prompts if the paper is accepted for publication\"\n\n    Yes, we will keep the dataset of safe and harmful prompts in the final version.\n\n7. \"... this statement needs more precision as a less careful reader may not realize this property may not always hold.\"\n\n   Indeed, the statement you quote is a bit strong. It should be modified to reflect that the property holds most of the times. We have replaced the statement with the following: Our procedure relies on the inherent property of safe prompts: Subsequences of safe prompts remain safe in most everyday use of LLMs. We have also corrected the conclusion section to reflect this change. Thank you for helping us to make our claims more precise."

                        "value": "8. \"Am I correct in assuming that your method implicitly assumes that is-harmful is a deterministic function?\"\n\n    The safety filter is-harmful need not be deterministic. In the probabilistic case, the probability with which the filter detects a harmful prompt $P$ as harmful is a lower bound on the probability of erase-and-check detecting the adversarial prompt $P + \\alpha$ as harmful. Using this fact, we can directly certify the expected accuracy of our procedure over a distribution (or dataset), without having to certify for each individual sample (Theorem 1). Please see Appendix G for a proof of Theorem 1.\n\n    However, since the Llama 2 safety filter is probabilistic,  we should perform several evaluations of the filter over the dataset to ensure that the estimated accuracy holds with a high degree of confidence. To this end, we calculate the accuracy of the Llama 2 filter using 60,000 samples (by sampling harmful prompts with replacement) to \"average out\" the effect of the internal randomness of Llama 2. We observe an accuracy of 92% on these 60K samples. Using concentration bounds such as Hoeffding's inequality, we can guarantee that the true accuracy is above 91% with a confidence of 99.9%. Note that, the trained DistilBERT safety classifier used in our new results in Section 6 is deterministic in nature and its accuracy on the dataset is constant.\n\n9. \"I had some difficulty interpreting the results in Figure 3(b).\"\n\n    Figure 3(b) plots the average running time per prompt of the erase-and-check procedure, that is, the average time to run is-harmful on all erased subsequences per prompt. We explain the reason behind the trend in section 3.1. We have added further clarifications in the updated version.\n\n    On the basis of our observation, the trend could be due to two reasons. First, Llama 2 is slower in responding to incomplete prompts and often asks for further clarifications. This is the reason behind the sharp increase in the running time from 0 to 10 tokens. Second, the safe prompts are roughly between 15 and 25 tokens in size (similar to the harmful prompts from AdvBench), which means that the average number of erased subsequences checked does not grow rapidly for larger erase lengths. For example, the number of erased subsequences of a prompt of length 15 tokens for an erase length of 30 is the same as that for an erase length of 20. The average running time will become constant once the erase length increases the size of the largest prompt in the dataset.\n\n10. \"I do not believe I saw your is-harmful prompt in the supplement paper.\"\n\n    We provide an example of the type of system instruction prompt used for Llama 2 in the Safety Filter section in the introduction. The exact prompt used can be found in the defense.py file in the is-harmful function. We also include the exact prompt from the code file in Appendix J of the updated draft. We use the zero-shot learning paradigm and do not show any examples of safe or harmful prompts to Llama 2 in the instructions."
