This is achieved by employing text-to-image models to generate images featuring uncommon combinations of objects and backgrounds. These generated images are added to the test dataset only if they are misclassified by multiple off-the-shelf vision models. Experimental results demonstrate that well-known foundation models, such as MiniGPT-4 and LLaVa, struggle significantly when faced with these constructed datasets."

                    "value": "- The proposed framework is not specifically designed for applying to foundation models. As it is applicable to any kind of vision model, the motivation of this study is made unclear. In addition, the number of object categories in the created dataset sounds somewhat small, if we consider to evaluate large-scale foundation models.\n\n- The experimental results are not so appealing. It is already well-known that background information can work as spurious cues in vision tasks [R1, R2]. The authors claim that the proposed framework can be also extended to various vulnerabilities \"beyond background\", but there is no concrete examples or empirical results. \n\n[R1] \"Object Recognition with and without Objects,\" IJCAI 2017.\n\n[R2] \"Human Action Recognition without Human,\" ECCV Workshop, 2016.\n\n- Figure 3 does not provide any essential information on why these models misclassify those images, because the explanations in the answer to the second question is just the output of the model, not coming from the analysis of the inference process by the model such as shown in Figure 9. \n\n- Somewhat related to the above, it is not clear if the misclassification by the foudantion models are really due to the spurious cues incurred by background information. As the text-to-image models generate the images from uncommon combination of objects and backgrounds, the generated images might contain artifacts caused by under-represented prompts, which leads to poor performance of the vision models trained only with natural images. \n\n- How to determine surrogate models is not described clearly.\n  - In Figure 8, eight models seem to be used in this experiments, but there is no explanation on what models they are and their orders in use. This experimental result should heavily depend on these points.\n  - It seems that the difficulty is measured by the decrese in classification accuracy, but how did the authors measure the diversity?\n  - How to choose the four surrogate models used in the experiments at Section 4 is unclear. The authors state that they choose them by considering a tradeoff between test set diversity and difficulty, but detailed information is not provided in the paper, which may doubt the validity of the experimental design."

To address this, they introduce the \"DiffusionExplorer\" framework, which efficiently assesses the vulnerabilities of foundation models. Using this framework, they create a test set that exposes the limitations of models like MiniGPT-4 and LLaVa, reducing their accuracy by around 30% and 40%, respectively. The study demonstrates the potential of generative models in revealing the weaknesses of large vision foundation models."

DiffuMask is dealing with semantic segmentation, which is pixel level. However,  for image-level understanding, it's slightly simpler to get the GT label.\n\n2/ Some of the images are even not very clear to human to answer the questions.

The prompt is \"Can you describe this image as detailed as possible?\". Here are the outputs of both models:\nLLaVA: \"The image features a room with a large wall made of numerous wooden slats, creating a unique and intricate design. The wall is filled with many small wooden boxes, giving the appearance of a honeycomb structure. In the center of the room, there is a wooden bench, providing a seating area for visitors. The room appears to be a part of a museum or an art installation, as the wooden wall and bench create an interesting and visually appealing environment.\"\n\nMiniGPT4: \"This image shows a room with a wooden bench in the center. The walls are made of wooden planks stacked vertically, creating a grid pattern. The bench appears to be placed in the middle of the room, with the planks forming a backrest for the seat. The room appears to be dimly lit, with no visible light sources. The overall atmosphere of the image is quiet and contemplative.\"\n\nTo me both models outputs make sense.  I do not think both models are confused on this image. The example given in the paper is really about the prompt that is given to the  MiniGPT/LLaVA model \"Is the image more like a photo of a bench or a speaker?\". This prompt causes confusions, and thus the answer to this prompt is not well defined.  To me both models can understand this content of this image quite well."
