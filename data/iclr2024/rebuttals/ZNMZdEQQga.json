However, the chosen approach fails to take into account the class label, as it is expected that some neurons would specialize for a certain class. The proposed approach might also hinder the specialization of neurons, which is a desirable trait.\n- The theoretical analysis needs to be more concise and clearly state actionable insights. The chosen approach makes it seem like an expected result that mutual information would increase.\n- I am not convinced that simply copying the weights of the active neurons to inactive neurons is an optimal approach for implementing transplantation. The authors also fail to provide a convincing justification for this choice.\n- The biggest concern lies with the empirical validation and the applicability of the method. The primary analysis is conducted on MNIST, which is not an issue in itself. However, the baselines are much lower than those of traditional MLPs. The decision not to utilize activation layers is concerning and lacks justification. This raises questions about whether their findings hold with activation layers, which are essential for the applicability of the method.\n- While the authors claim that their method is applicable to different architectures, they have not demonstrated this. They only considered different numbers of hidden layers in MLPs, which does not truly constitute a different architecture. The applicability of their approach to CNNs, for instance, remains unclear. Furthermore, it's important to consider how activation layers and batch normalization would affect their findings.\n- Extending the study to more complex datasets like CIFAR-10 is also left unclear."

This is a different program than the paper pursues in ANNs.  \n\nTo reset the weights feeding into or out of units to high values, after those weights have been trained into irrelevance, is highly counterintuitive, and thus requires a very strong argument to justify. In this case, a non-trivial increase in accuracy would be needed (this does not happen).\n\nThe results are for NNs with linear activation functions. How the proposed method would work in NNs with non-linear activation functions is important but not addressed.\n\nReviewer limitation: I did not read section 3 (Theoretical Analysis)."

In some cases my comments may reflect points that I believe are incorrect or incomplete. In most cases, my comments reflect spots where an average well-intentioned reader might stumble for various reasons, reducing the potential impact of the paper. The issue may be the text, or my finite understanding, or a combination. These comments point to opportunities to clarify and smooth the text to better convey the intended story. I urge the authors to decide how or whether to address these comments. I regret that the tone can come out negative even for a paper I admire; it's a time-saving mechanism for which I apologize.\n\nThanks for a clearly formatted bibliography, which made checking up on references easy.\n\nAbstract: \"transplant\" in the context of neuroscience, to the extent that I am aware, does not parallel the transplanting proposed in this paper, so the BNN-ANN parallel is not motivating.\n\n\"such an interaction has decreased\": I don't think this is true. I believe it is an active and fertile area of research. Some years ago I wrote multiple papers in this area.\n\n\"is hardly limited\": meaning is unclear\n\nTop of pg 3: For Hebbian learning, both neurons must be active at the same time. How does the definition of \"activity\" (previous page) for ANN units align with this? It sounds like activity is the variance of one unit's output.\n\ntop of pg 6 \"rutern balanced and high variance output\": Is this true? I am not familiar with this. \n\nFig 7 formatting: too small for me. Axis labels and tick labels are too small. Perhaps give more detail in the caption to orient the reader to the important points in the images.\n\nFig 9: I do not see a difference in A and B. Also, what does the unchanged trained network produce (as a baseline)? I ask because the transplanting seems to be undoing the effects of training.\n\nTable 2: Can this include +/- std dev over multiple runs? This makes clear whether the difference between the two methods is within a noise envelope (see also the text re results for CIFAR-10 near the end of section 4)."

The paper achieves transplantation in the perceptron by first measuring the variance of a neuron/cell across $k$ batches of data. The variance will serve as the activeness of the cell, inspired by Hebbian theory.  Transplantation in the perceptron will effectively duplicate the activity of high-variance neurons into lower-variance neurons.\n\nThe authors empirically compare the effectiveness of their transplantation method against having no transplantation and having random transplantation. They state that their transplantation method is more effective than random transplantation and no transplantation."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "My biggest concern in this paper is the performance of the transplanted multi-layer perceptron: in the ablation results for $\\eta$ and $k$, the accuracy does not surpass $90$% for MNIST, including $\\eta=0$ (vanilla multi-layer perceptron). It is widely accepted that MNIST achieves an accuracy of $>90$% for MNIST on logistic regression. Hence, the multi-layer perceptron described in the paper (with a hidden layer of width 100) should comfortably achieve $>90$% for MNIST.\n\nMy second biggest concern is the strong abuse of the term perceptron. The perceptron refers to a single-neuron such that $y=wx + b$, where $w$ is a **vector** of real-valued weights. In the paper, the authors define a perceptron as having a weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$, which is rather a multi-layer perceptron. These are fundamental concepts that should not be abused. In particular, Hebbian learning in a perceptron is very well understood, as having the update rule $w_{t+1} = w_t + yx$, it would have been advantageous to highlight this to describe hebbian learning in perceptrons. However, I believe in the manuscript, the authors were largely referring to multi-layer perceptrons and not the perceptron.\n\nGenerally, I don't find that the paper highlights or addresses a problem with artificial neural networks beyond seeking inspiration from neurobiology. Why would we need transplantation in neural networks?\n\nI found the mutual information analysis lacks clarity: the authors compute the mutual information between the data $x$ and the output $y$ and compare the different transplantation methods. However, I don't find that the authors sufficiently motivate why this analysis is important and how this relates to transplantation.\n\nMinor feedback:\n\n- Section 2.2 is not necessary, and can be moved to the appendix.\n- Figures 4, 7, 9, and 11 are very small, it would be good to make them larger to make them more legible.\n- The algorithm is relatively simple, would be nice to make the code available."
