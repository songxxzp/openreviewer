The authors highlight that while methods based on independent characteristics of drugs and targets have shown commendable performance, it's essential to consider drug-target interaction within a high-dimensional space. Thus, incorporating interactive information becomes rational. This study introduces BiTGNN, an improved method building upon previous work. Experimental results demonstrate that BiTGNN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets, showing superior performance in terms of AUC, AUPR, precision, and accuracy metrics."

The writing style is highly disorganized. The formulas for GCN and self-attention are copied without any modification. Figure 1 is unclear, making it difficult to understand how GAT and GCN are combined. The tables are confusing, making it challenging to differentiate between different methods.\n\n3. The data and evaluation metrics are unclear. The article does not provide information about the dataset size or the ratio of positive to negative examples. The choice of AUC and AUPR as evaluation metrics is not adequately justified. Additionally, comparing the proposed model to non-practical baseline methods such as RF and SVM raises questions about the selection of appropriate comparison benchmarks.\n\n4.

The current formatting of tables and figures in the paper appears inconsistent and difficult to read. Inconsistencies in table formats and small, unclear figure legends can significantly hinder the reader's ability to understand and interpret the data and model architecture effectively.\n- The model's complex architecture, particularly the use of bidirectional transformers and attention mechanisms, might pose challenges in terms of interpretability. The authors could incorporate methods to enhance the interpretability of the model, such as attention visualization or feature importance analysis. Techniques like Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) or SHAP values could be used to understand which features or parts of the graph structure most significantly influence the model's predictions, thereby providing biological insights and validation.\n- The paper mentions the use of negative sampling to address the imbalance in the training data but does not delve into the specifics of how this sampling is conducted or how it impacts model performance. More details on the negative sampling strategy and its impact on model training and performance would be valuable. Exploring and comparing different approaches to handle data imbalance, such as synthetic minority over-sampling or advanced negative sampling techniques, could provide insights into the most effective strategies for DTI prediction.\n- There is no mention of a robustness or sensitivity analysis in the model evaluation. Understanding how changes in input data (e.g., noise in the datasets, missing values, or erroneous entries) affect the model's predictions is crucial for evaluating its practical utility. The authors should consider including a robustness analysis, testing how the model performs with varying levels of noise or incomplete data. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis to understand how different hyperparameters (like the length of the protein sequences in PsePSSM, or the dimensionality of the drug fingerprints) impact the model's performance would be insightful."
