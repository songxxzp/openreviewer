Subsequent experiments have also demonstrated that this Token Mixer achieves similar or even better results compared to the baseline method."

The experiments appear to be inadequate, as many necessary ablation experiments and comparisons are missing, such as verifying the effectiveness of using pooling as a replacement for self-attention in large datasets like traffic or electricity.\n\n2. The paper lacks innovation as it seems to be a straightforward transfer of some ideas from MetaFormer into the temporal domain, even though the original work was not in the time series domain. More comprehensive comparisons of various replacement methods for the Token Mixer have been made.\n\n3. Additionally, there is no clear and evident demonstration of the innovation in this multifunctional architecture."

These methods provide a range of options for experimentation.\n2\u3001Lack of Persuasiveness in Experiments: The experiments are criticized for lacking persuasiveness in terms of baseline models and dataset diversity. This suggests that the paper may need to include more comprehensive experiments or justify the choices made in the current experimental setup.\n3\u3001Performance of Pooling in PatchTST: There is curiosity about how pooling performs when directly applied to newer approaches like PatchTST. This raises questions about the effectiveness and adaptability of pooling within different time series frameworks."
