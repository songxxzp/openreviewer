What the reuslts would be if the denoising module is compiled with other defense model?  For example, GATGuard + DMGAN. \nIt looks like the two modules of DRAGON can be decoupled. \n3. It is amazing that DRAGON is so efficient. Dose the reported time in Table 18 include the training time of DMGAN?\n4. DRAGON adopts other defense model as backbone, which could seems a little unfair. I wonder how DRAGON would perform when compiled with other basic GNNs like GCN? Is it sill competitive?\n5. Why the baselines like GATGuard and EvenNet not coupled with AT?"

But from this section, I do not get why MoE is useful though the authors empirically illustrate that in the experimental part.\n2. Lemma 1 is very confusing. It is hard to understand what the authors are trying to state in this lemma and how it supports the method. The most confusing thing is that \"Suppose a GNN f(\u00b7) containing DPMoE satisfies (\u03b5,\u03b4)-DP\", how can this be supposed? I thought Lemma 1 was to prove that adding a DPMoE module to the model would make it DP, but the authors directly assume that. Besides, what does this mean \"node v is robust to the features $h_v^{(l)}$\"? This statement is too informal and the authors should characterize robustness in rigorous mathematical expressions."

It appears that the considered baselines were not specifically designed to address the attack scenarios under consideration (i.e., the injection of nodes). For instance, EvenNet is specifically designed for generalization to graphs with different degrees of homophily. Consequently, claiming superiority over them may not strongly support the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors should consider evaluating their approach against state-of-the-art methods better aligned with the specified attack scenarios.\n\nW3.
