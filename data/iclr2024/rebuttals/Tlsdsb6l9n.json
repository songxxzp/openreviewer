Consequently, the comprehensiveness of the performance assessment may be somewhat limited. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, additional comparisons with domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those mentioned in references [1] and [2], would be valuable.

                        "value": "We sincerely thank you for your insightful feedback. We have addressed your concerns below and hope our responses provide clarity:\n\n**1. Quality control**\n\nIn light of your valuable feedback, we have now expanded Section 3.2 to include a more comprehensive explanation of the quality control procedures we implemented **(Highlighted in Section 3.2, Page 4)**.\n\n**2. More domain-specific baselines**\n\nIn response, we have incorporated two new domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) into our evaluation: Galactica-6.7B[1] and PMC_LLaMA_13B[2]. This is because BioMedLM[3] and PMC_LLAMA_7B[4] are primarily suited for text-generation tasks. When prompted with questions and options, they tend to generate more options rather than providing answers, due to their lack of instruction tuning. To address this, we included PMC_LLaMA_13B, an instruction-tuned version of PMC_LLAMA_7B, as a new baseline in our study. \n\nThe updated results reflecting these expansions can be found in **Tables 3 and 4**, as well as **Figures 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11** in our revised manuscript. \n\n**3. More challenging datasets**\n\nRegarding the inclusion of the ScienceQA[5] dataset, we note that the majority of ScienceQA's biology-related content is multimodal, which does not align well with the current focus of Mol-instructions on text and molecular/protein sequences. \n\nIncorporating multimodal data from ScienceQA would require a substantial extension of the Mol-instructions dataset to support formats beyond text and sequences. While this falls outside the scope of our current research, we recognize the potential value of such an expansion. It represents a promising direction for future work, where Mol-instructions could be enhanced to support a broader range of data types, including multimodal data. This would allow for a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in biomolecular research and is a pathway we are keen to explore in our future endeavors **(Highlighted in Section 6, Page 9)**.\n\n**4. Factuality analysis**\n\nThank you for highlighting the importance of a more in-depth analysis of the factuality of the generated text. The main challenge we encounter is the lack of a unified and widely accepted standard for evaluating tasks related to molecular/protein understanding. Consequently, we have relied on measurement methods used in previous NLP research.\n\nWe also attempted to use GPT-4 with certain predefined rules for scoring, but this approach did not yield stable scores. On the other hand, expert review, while potentially more accurate, is extremely time-consuming. Acknowledging these limitations, we are actively exploring more feasible and effective methods to analyze the factuality of the generated text, aiming to improve the robustness and reliability of our evaluation process.\n\nThank you once more for your invaluable suggestions, which have significantly helped in enhancing the rigor of our experiments and the completeness of our paper!\n\n[1] https://huggingface.co/facebook/galactica-6.7b   \n[2] https://huggingface.co/axiong/PMC_LLaMA_13B   \n[3] https://huggingface.co/stanford-crfm/BioMedLM  \n[4] https://huggingface.co/chaoyi-wu/PMC_LLAMA_7B  \n[5] Learn to Explain: Multimodal Reasoning via Thought Chains for Science Question Answering. 2022."

Below are our responses:\n\n**Impact of Reduced Data on LLM Performance**\n\nThe main premise of LIMA[1] is that almost all knowledge is acquired during the pre-training phase, and only a limited amount of instruction tuning data is needed to guide LLMs in generating high-quality outputs. For the domain-specific data encompassed in Mol-instructions, LLMs may not have encountered such data during the pre-training stage. Therefore, using fewer instruction data might not adequately equip the model to grasp the response format of this particular dataset. Our goal in constructing Mol-instructions was to comprehensively cover various biomolecular tasks, thereby infusing the model with relevant knowledge. This ensures that even users focusing on specific tasks can effectively utilize this dataset for subsequent research, benefiting the entire community. \nIndeed, the instruction tuning process may not necessarily require the full set of instruction data. I believe your suggestion provides an excellent starting point for future work, which could focus on discussing the most effective selection methods for sampling the most beneficial alignment data.\n\nThank you again for your constructive suggestions! We hope our responses address your concerns.\n\n[1] LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment. 2023."

                    "value": "**Main concern on experiments:**\n\nMy major concern is the experiment part. Specifically, the current comparison and presentation scheme can lead to overestimated results and misleading conclusions because it ignores some important domain-adapted baselines and mainly compares them with domain-agnostic baselines, which are not fine-tuned or designed for scientific tasks. The authors are encouraged to appropriately acknowledge and compare these tasks with previous methods and datasets in order to improve their potential impact. Here I list the important baselines below:\n\n1. An easier molecule instruction tuning dataset: Text+Chem T5 [1]. [1] has included most of the tasks/datasets in Mol-Instructions, including forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis, description-guided molecule design, and molecule description generation. However, the discussion and comparison to Text+Chem T5 are missing. \n2. Scientific language models: Galactica [2]. Compared to the general-purpose LLMs (e.g., Vicuna and Alpaca) reported in the experiments, Galactica is specifically designed and pretrained for the science corpus and should be considered an important baseline.\n3. Molecular Language Models: MoMu [3] and MolT5 [4]. These models are designed for description-guided molecule design and molecule description generation\n4. The recent methods for reagent prediction [7], forward reaction prediction [5,6], and retrosynthesis [5]. Note that, the baselines in these domains employ different evaluation metrics compared to those reported in the paper. \n5. Baselines for protein-related tasks.\n\nI understand that incorporating all these methods for empirical comparison is challenging, and an LLM is not expected to outperform all the state-of-the-art methods in every task to be a valuable contribution. However, I think the comparison to Text+Chem T5 [1] and Galactica [2] is essential and important, considering their similar purposes to this submission. It would also be valuable to report the performances of the single-task state-of-the-art methods in the Tables and Figures (you may not have to outperform these methods) to help empirical comparisons in follow-up works.\n\n\n**Other weaknesses:**\n\n- The quality control and curation process for constructing the dataset should be described more thoroughly. More details in data processing would strengthen confidence in the dataset.\n- Table 5 lists the sources of data used in this paper, but it does not detail the availability or the methods for programmatic access to these data sources. Disclosing these particulars may aid researchers in replicating this paper.\n- The Mol-Instructions dataset integrates various tasks in the field of biochemistry, such as the molecular and protein-related characteristics shown in Table 2. However, the experiments only conduct tests on a limited number of biomolecular tasks. Such an evaluation approach may not fully reflect performance on complex biomolecular problems.\n\n\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Unifying Molecular and Textual Representations via Multi-task Language Modelling.

                        "value": "We sincerely thank you for your insightful feedback. Below are our detailed responses to your concerns: \n\n**1. More domain-specific baselines**\n\nBased on your recommendations, we have expanded our set of baselines to include Text+Chem T5[1], Galactica[2], and MolT5[3] as these models have undergone instruction tuning, aligning them more closely with the objectives of our study. \n\nRegarding the baselines [4,5,6], we have chosen not to include them in our comparison as they focus on pretraining purely on molecular data without any instruction-following. This difference in approach makes a direct comparison somewhat unfair. However, we would like to clarify that our evaluation methods for reagent prediction, forward reaction prediction, and retrosynthesis are consistent with those used by Text+Chem T5[1], which we hope alleviates some of your concerns.\n\nFor protein-related tasks, the most closely related baseline we found was [7]. However, due to the unavailability of their code, we were unable to include it in our direct comparison. Instead, we have incorporated Galactica[2] as a baseline for these tasks, considering its relevance and accessibility.\n\nThe updated results reflecting these expansions can be found in **Tables 3 and 4**, as well as **Figures 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11** in our revised manuscript. \n\n**2. Lack of data processing details**\n\nDue to page constraints, a detailed description of our data transformation process, from the original sources to instruction data, was not feasible within the main text. However, to ensure transparency and reproducibility, we have included an extensive explanation in **Appendix B (Pages 15-22)**. This section thoroughly details each task's definition, data sources, and the methodology employed to convert this data into the intended instruction format. We believe this provides a clear and comprehensive understanding of our data processing approach. Moreover, we have also added further details on quality control measures **(Highlighted in Section 3.2, Page 4)**.\n\n**3. Insufficient tasks**\n\nWe apologize for any misunderstanding and would like to clarify that our experiments comprehensively cover the 17 tasks listed in Figure 3. These include:\n\n- **Molecule-oriented Tasks:** Molecular Description Generation (Figure 5), Description-guided Molecule Design (Table 4), Forward Reaction Prediction (Table 4), Retrosynthesis (Table 4), Reagent Prediction (Table 4), Property Prediction (Table 3).\n- **Protein-oriented Tasks:** Domain/Motif Prediction (Figure 5), Functional Description Generation (Figure 5), Protein Function Prediction (Figure 5), Catalytic Activity Prediction (Figure 5), Protein Design (Figure 9)\n- **Biomolecular Text Tasks:** Open Question (Figure 6), Multi-choice Question (Figure 6), Chemical-protein Interaction Extraction (Figure 6), Chemical-disease Interaction Extraction (Figure 6), Chemical Entity Recognition (Figure 6), True or False Question (Figure 6).\n\nWe believe that the variety of tasks covered by Mol-Instructions provides a substantial representation of common biomolecular challenges. Nevertheless, we recognize that there are aspects of biomolecular research that we have not yet explored. These represent opportunities for further enhancement in future research, and we are committed to continually expanding and refining our dataset to encompass an even wider range of biomolecular challenges.\n\nThank you again for your valuable suggestions!
