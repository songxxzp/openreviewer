                        "value": "We appreciate some of the reviewer\u2019s comments while cannot agree with the others. Perhaps the reviewer does not carefully read and correctly understand our paper, his/her comment could be subjective. First of all we would like to reiterate our key contribution, and highlights, although it has already been discussed at the end of Section 2.1 in the main text. The technique we employed in NEKM is quite standard in the community of mathematics. While this may be challenging for practitioners to understand, we can interpret the process formally using the standard terminology of machine learning. Basically, we decompose the solution process of semi-linear PDEs into two stages: 1) training stage: this involves the pretraining of Green functions, the training of neural network representation of evolutionary kernels based on boundary integral formulations; 2) inference stage: this involves the time evolution of the dynamics of the PDEs using the well-trained kernel. This decomposition is a result of insightful observation of the mathematical structure of the underlying PDEs. The linear parts of the PDEs admit convolutional representation, which takes into account the geometry information, the linear operator information, and the boundary conditions. BINet is naturally employed to give a NeuralNet approximation of this linear evolutionary operator. Moreover, due to the semi-group property of the underlying PDEs, the training for this convolutional representation is time independent and thus can be done in advance. The nonlinear parts of the PDEs admit nonlinear transformation of the underlying nonlinear flows that can be solved exactly, making them look like the activation process of CNNs. A carefully designed time discretization method integrates these two key structures into a whole NeuralNet architechture, resulting in a CNN-like mechanism. Specifically, in the first step, we train the kernel function (also called density function) and the Green's function (if necessary), and in subsequent steps, all that is required is the network inference and numerical integrations. The training of our Green's function is a one-time effort and can be used for the inference, evolution, and even the solution of other similar equations after the fact. Moreover, due to the energy stable property of the underlying PDEs, a particularly designed time discretization (energy stable scheme) can maintain the energy so that the NeuralNet structure carries the energy stable flows as its natural property. This is consistent with the physical principle, i.e., the 2nd law of thermodynamics, making the proposed NeuralNet framework physically reliable.\n\nResponses to Weaknesses:\n\n1.\tFor a linear partial differential operator, its fundamental solution exists, and the expressions for many fundamental solutions are known. Even if the fundamental solution is currently unknown, NeuralNet approximations of the fundamental solutions are still available (through radial basis function representations) and under our investigation. Regarding the accurate numerical integration, we have already employed asymptotic expansions and integration by parts, as mentioned in the text, to handle singular integrals. In mathematical terms, this does not introduce errors, so there is no need to worry about significant errors arising from the integration.\n\n2.\tWe have already compared the examples of the Allen-Cahn equation we worked on in the rectangular region (Section 3.2) and on the hemisphere (Section 3.3) with the solutions of classical numerical methods or the true solutions. In Appendix D.2, we explain the feasibility of the NEKM method compared to PINNs in this case. We invite the reviewer to go through these details. \n\n3.\tWe appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion. The size of Figure 12 has been adjusted.\n\nResponses to Questions:\n\n1.\tAs introduced in the first paragraph, the training of the Green's function is a one-time effort, allowing us to take sufficient sampling points and computational efforts to approximate it as accurately as possible. This is definitely not a problem in the numerical experiments as can be observed in the presented results. By the numerical stability of the scheme we applied in time discretization, the errors cannot be amplified during the evolution. Nevertheless, one can apply the feedback control by sampling more data from the true trajectory of the PDE to reduce the approximation and enhance training and inference of the solution process in every time marching block. \n\n2.\tIn Appendix A.2, we elaborate on the acquisition of the Green's function G, whose singularity essentially arises from the fundamental solution G_0, and therefore, it can be estimated. \n\n3.\tEnergy stability is achieved through the time discretization of numerical schemes, and this can be rigorously proven mathematically, rather than being a baseless claim or anecdotal evidence. Please refer to Reference given in section 2.2 for more details."

For instance, the accuracy of Green's function training may decrease due to the complexity of the domain. This would be a long-term aspect of our work that needs further exploration.\n\n2.\tWe believe that our approach differs from the methods for solving time-dependent PDEs mentioned in the literature, although both involve time discretization. We emphasize an evolutionary pattern that allows us to minimize reliance on neural network training in the steps following the initial stage. The papers referred by the reviewer are all based on the L^2 residual loss minimization, which is essentially different from ours. As explained in the opening paragraph above, we aim to develop an inference-type NeuralNet architecture which preserves the physical principle such as energy stability. This is the novel point of our work.\n\n3.\tDue to its inference nature, the computational efficiency can be good even in comparison with classical numerical methods, as the proposed method avoids the solution of linear solver but instead saves the solution operator via a well-trained NeuralNet. The comparison of computational efficiency with PINNs was also provided in the appendix.\n\nResponses to Questions:\n\n1.\tOur main contribution is proposing an evolution law for time-dependent equations using a time discretization scheme, operator splitting, and boundary integral equations. In the solving process, we utilized the knowledge from the papers (Lin et al., 2023a and Lin et al., 2023b). As stated in our article, BINet and BI-GreenNet are the two essential tools we require. Additionally, we provided a detailed description of how to handle singularities introduced by the fundamental solution in boundary integrals.\n\n2.\tWe focus on semi-linear PDEs because they allow us to derive the evolutionary pattern of the desired ideal solution, something that is not achievable with nonlinear PDEs (which may not even have a corresponding fundamental solution for the operator). This is discussed in the opening paragraph above. In fact, we claim to be able to solve semi-linear PDEs, which already covers a broad range of time-evolving PDEs. We only require the spatial part of the differential operator to be linear, meaning terms like (u_x)^2 are excluded. We allow terms such as f(u) to appear, encompassing a significant class of PDE equations."

The authors address the challenges of solving PDEs with DNNs that a majority of these methods do not use any mathematical or physical parameters and require a large amount of parameters to tune. The authors propose the Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM) to solve a type of evolutionary PDEs with DNN based kernels. The core idea is to incorporate pre-trained Green's functions. NEKM is an alternating two-step procedure that first analytically or numerically solves a nonlinear ODE to obtain a flow map and then numerically integrate the related linear PDE with a convolutional kernel."

It is only briefly discussed in one sentence of related work with a majority on the PINNs literature. In particular, in the related works, the authors discuss in detail how boundary conditions are incorporated into Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The related in Neural Operator community should be discussed, such as how to incorporated boundary conditions into Neural Operators in Saad et. al, \"Guiding continuous operator learning through Physics-based boundary constraints\", ICLR 2023.\n- The method only works on semi-linear PDEs. This is actually a very strong assumption and limitation. The authors should discuss the extension to nonlinear PDEs.\n- Evaluation: the method is only tested on the simple linear heat/diffusion equation and Allen-Cahn equations. The heat equation is smooth and parabolic and very easy for numerical methods to solve. It would be nice to test hyperbolic problems with shocks, e.g., in the GPME benchmarking framework in Hansen, et. al, \"Learning physical models that can respect conservation laws\", ICML 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11002).\n- The method seems to have strong limitations if the first step requires an analytical or numerical solution to the ODE. \n- In particular, the authors should clarify this in the last paragraph of the introduction. I don't understand where the nonlinear ODE is coming from in step 1 and then how there is \"numerically integration\" for the related linear PDE. Typically, in numerical methods a (non)linear PDE is first discretized in space and then the resulting semi-discrete form of the ODE is discretized in time. The authors should clarify what they mean here.\n- I think some of the equation details of BINet in the related work should be moved to an appendix or background section.\n- Care should be taken with the discretization because this adds a first order error into the scheme. For example, the first equation should not be discretized with the 1st order accurate Forward Euler without even citing the method. This is an explicit method and there are necessary bounds on $\\Delta t$/$\\tau$ to ensure numerical stability.  See Krishnapriyan et. al, \"Learning continuous models for continuous physics\", 2023 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.08494.pdf) on how the time discretization matters in NeuralODE and the 4th order RK4 is advantageous but even that scheme without being careful about the numerics can lead to convergence issues.\n- Ideally the method and presentation wouldn't need to be separated into separate cases for linear equations or not.\n- It seems like the method depends too strongly on the BINet method and the authors should better differentiate the novelty between the two.\n- The exposition of the method in Section 2 isn't too clear and some of the details can be moved to an appendix.\n- The unique features of the NEKM subsection seems like it could be incorporated with the contributions subsection in the intro.\n- Label x and y axis in Figure 3.\n- Another major weakness in the evaluation is just comparing to the exact solution and no other baseline methods, especially to related neural operator based methods.\n\nMinor\n- First paragraph of related works can be longer and combined with parts of the longer second paragraph.\n- heat equation shouldn't be plural in the last bullet point of the contributions.\n- comma after \"In this section\" at the beginning of Section 2 Method\n- I would name Section 2 with the specific method name Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM) rather than the generic Method.\n- Could use standard notation from numerical methods $\\Delta t$ instead $\\tau$\n- Comma missing after Equation 7.\n- Larger title lave on Figure 6."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer very much for his/her reading and evaluation; this will be very helpful for the improvement of our work! \n\nResponses to Weaknesses:\n\n1.\tThank the reviewer for his/her suggestion, but we proposed it at the beginning of the method section, which should be considered a relatively conventional approach.\n\n2.\tAs suggested, we incorporated content related to FNO in the related work section in the revised paper.\n\n3.\tWe focus on semi-linear PDEs because they allow us to derive the evolutionary pattern of the desired ideal solution, something that is not achievable with nonlinear PDEs (which may not even have a corresponding fundamental solution for the operator). In fact, we claim to be able to solve semi-linear PDEs, covering a broad range of time-evolving PDEs. We only require the spatial part of the differential operator to be linear, meaning terms like (u_x)^2 are excluded. We allow terms such as f(u) to appear, encompassing a significant class of PDE equations.\n\n4.\tYes, the heat equation is a fundamental example, and we have added examples of the Allen-Cahn equation. Traditional numerical methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation are not straightforward, often requiring considerations of numerical stability and knowledge related to energy stability. Additionally, our goal is to solve the equation in a general domain, posing new challenges for traditional methods. Examples of other equations will be explored in future numerical experiments.\n\n5.\tRegarding the concerns about the difficulty of analytically solving ODEs, there is no need to worry. The ODEs we solve have the form u_t = f(u), excluding spatially related differential operators, making them amenable to analytical solutions through integration. In Appendix D.1, we provide a specific example of implementation.\n\n6.\tNonlinear ODEs are given by operator splitting, as detailed in case 2 of Section 2.1. In essence, our method alternates between solving the nonlinear ODE part, solving the linear PDE, and solving the ODE\u2014a standard Strang splitting process. For a better understanding, refer to the detailed examples in case 2 of Section 2.1 and Appendix D.1. Due to space limitations, we were unable to showcase the specific implementation of the method in the numerical experiments section but included it in the appendix.\n\n7.\tAs suggested, we have reduced the introduction section's discussion of BINet.\n\n8.\tThe reviewer pointed out the discrete formulation in our article: our time discretization uses a first-order implicit scheme. However, in principle, we can adopt higher-order time discretization schemes without increasing difficulty. Traditional numerical methods need to balance spatial and temporal step sizes to ensure stability, but our method, not relying on spatial discretization, eliminates stability concerns. If one is concerned about energy stability and other properties, our method can still be combined with the corresponding time discretization formats to achieve the desired results.\n\n9.\tOur method indeed relies on BINet, but our primary contribution lies in proposing an evolution law for time-dependent equations using time discretization, operator splitting, and boundary integral equations. It can be combined with the appropriate time discretization format to maintain the desired properties. Additionally, we provided a detailed description of how to handle singularities introduced by the fundamental solution in boundary integrals.\n\n10.\tThis is corrected.\n\n11.\tIn Appendix D.1, we compared the accuracy of the NEKM method with the PINN method; in Appendix D.2, we explained situations where the PINN method is challenging to train, while our method remains effective. We apologize for any confusion caused.\n\nMinor points: We followed the reviewer\u2019s instructions to revise the paper and correct those items.\n\nResponses to Question:\n\nThe technique we employed in NEKM is quite standard in the community of mathematics. Though challenging for practitioners, the process is formally interpreted using machine learning terms. The solution process for semi-linear PDEs involves two stages: 1) training\u2014pretraining Green functions and neural network representations of evolutionary kernels; 2) inference\u2014evolving PDE dynamics using the trained kernel. This decomposition results from observing the PDEs' mathematical structure. Linear parts have a convolutional representation through BINet, allowing time-independent training in advance. Nonlinear parts resemble CNN activation processes. A well-designed time discretization integrates structures into a NeuralNet architecture, resembling a CNN mechanism. Green's function training is a one-time effort for inference, evolution, and solving similar equations. Energy-stable property and a designed time discretization maintain energy, ensuring physical reliability in the proposed NeuralNet framework.\n\nOnce again, we thank the reviewer for his/her comments and suggestions!"

This may make the implementation and understanding of NEKM challenging for some users, potentially limiting its widespread adoption.\n\n6. **Empirical Validation Scope**: While the paper includes empirical validation on heat and Allen-Cahn equations, the scope of the empirical validation might be limited. A more extensive range of test cases across different scientific and engineering domains would strengthen the method's generalizability.\n\n7. **Scalability**: The paper does not explicitly address the scalability of the NEKM method.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer very much for his/her careful reading and helpful feedback; it will be instrumental in our improvement! We also appreciate his/her positive acknowledgment of our work.\n\nResponses to Weaknesses:\n\n1.\tThe technique we employed in NEKM is quite standard in the community of mathematics. Though challenging for practitioners, the process is formally interpreted using machine learning terms. The solution process for semi-linear PDEs involves two stages: 1) training\u2014pretraining Green functions and neural network representations of evolutionary kernels; 2) inference\u2014evolving PDE dynamics using the trained kernel. This decomposition results from observing the PDEs' mathematical structure. Linear parts have a convolutional representation through BINet, allowing time-independent training in advance. Nonlinear parts resemble CNN activation processes. A well-designed time discretization integrates structures into a NeuralNet architecture, resembling a CNN mechanism. Green's function training is a one-time effort for inference, evolution, and solving similar equations. Energy-stable property and a designed time discretization maintain energy, ensuring physical reliability in the proposed NeuralNet framework.\n\n2.\tSpecifically, in the first step, we train the kernel function and the Green's function (if necessary), and in subsequent steps, all that is required is network inference and numerical integration calculations. The training of our Green's function is a one-time effort and can be used for the inference, evolution, and even the solution of other similar equations after the fact.\n\n3.\tApplying our method to more complex domains is theoretically feasible, but in practice, it may pose many challenges. This would be a long-term aspect of our work that needs further exploration.\n\n4.\tRegarding the concern about interpretability, we integrated mathematical knowledge into our method precisely because of the lack of interpretability in some neural network methods, aiming to enhance the interpretability of the equation solutions. Nevertheless, achieving complete interpretability in deep learning is a challenging area for us, as well.\n\n5.\tYes, our method is more difficult than some other methods such as PINNs in coding, but our advantages has shown in 1.\n\n6.\tPlease see 3.\n\n7.\tThis may require extensive study including both sufficient computational experiments and deep theoretical thinking; this is indeed one of the long-term tasks in our future planning.\n\n8.\tIn Appendix D.1, we compared the accuracy of the NEKM method with the PINN method; in Appendix D.2, we explained situations where the PINN method is challenging to train, while our method remains effective. \n\nResponses to Questions:\n\n1.\tTraining the neural network in Equation 4 was very fast, sometimes taking less than a minute. Training the Green's function could take longer. This can be further improved if more sophisticated machine could be used (our computation is based on TITAN XP GPU). After training, calculations can be performed on a CPU, which usually does not take much time. \n\n2.\tThe proposed method mainly rely on numerical integration, which we believe is not quite sophisticated for practitioners. In fact, given the advantages we elaborate in our response to Weakness 1, the CNN-like structure of our method makes it easily generalized.\n\n3.\tPlease see 3 in \u2018Weakness\u2019 part.\n\n4.\tPlease see 4 in \u2018Weakness\u2019 part.\n\n5.\tEnergy-stable properties are derived from the physical features or inferred from the equation itself. Taking the Allen-Cahn equation as an example, it describes phase transitions in materials. The solution u represents the material's phase field, and the equation's evolution reflects changes in the phase field. In NEKM, the network not only outputs the solution's evolution but also ensures a certain energy decay.\n\n6.\tWhen handling singular boundary integrals, it is true that our method introduces some complexity at the code level. But it contributes to improved accuracy. \n\n7.\tYes, it is a long-term challenge, and we need to invest more effort to address it.\n\n8.\tPlease see 8 in \u2018Weakness\u2019 part.\n\n9.\tWe believe that the tasks we can prioritize mainly involve solving problems in more complex domains, including how to improve the accuracy of the method and reduce computation time. In fact, we already have collaborators who have proposed using neural networks to approximate G_0, which will reduce the time required for directly computing G_0 using explicit expressions.\n\n10.\tIt's evident that the reviewer values the practical utility of a method and its potential integration with engineering problems. This is an aspect we will pay attention to, and some of our collaborators are from commercial companies, so we will pay attention to their needs and continuously modify and improve our method.\n\nOnce again, we thank the reviewer for his/her helpful suggestions and questions; his/her positive recognition will be crucial to our continued advancement!"
