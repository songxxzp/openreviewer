In addition to that, MBeDED uses 'representative score' when adding environments to the replay buffer to increase the novelty of the environments the agent is trained on."

It took me several passes to grasp what's going on. \n\t* Already in the introduction, the authors use the terms that were not yet introduced, e.g. regret, GAE etc.  \n\t* The notation is often confusing. Some sets are defined using \\mathbb, some of them are capital bold letters. The 'representative observed state vector' is, in reality, not a vector, but a set. \n\t* Adding the parameterization to the models used in the paper (policies, value functions etc) would also help readability/understanding. Knowing what input / reward goes to which agent and what models each agent uses would greatly help the reader.\n* The paper focuses on the results more than on understanding.\n\t* In my opinion, the paper would be much more interesting and useful to the community if it goes deeper trying to understand the effect of the algorithmic decisions taken by the authors. For example, the paper poses an interesting hypothesis: \"While regret represents the learning potential of an environment, it fails to indicate whether all that potential can be achieved by a student and if so in how many steps.\" Validating this hypothesis empirically (and comparing regret vs marginal benefit) would be extremely interesting. This will also be practically useful as we want to know which design decisions to make and what limitations to take into account outside of the world of the BipedalWalker and Minigrid."

                    "value": "* As I mentioned in the Weaknesses section above, I highly recommend the authors to define all the concepts before they use them in the paper. \n* I would appreciate the authors addressing the notation issues I mentioned in the 'Weaknesses' section.\n* In your opinion, what are the implicit assumptions you made when designing MBeDED? \n* You treat each task as a POMDP, however, in Section 3.2, the value function takes states as inputs, and the diversity metrics are calculated on the states, not on the observations. Do you assume access to the states here? What are the states? Or do you calculate  those on observations?\n* I think the amount of mathematical notation can be significantly reduced in Section 3.2 as it makes it harder to read, and I don't think some of it is needed. The notation of the F_{div} is a bit inconsistent. Sometimes it takes two sets as inputs (e.g. RHS of equation 8), but sometimes it takes a vector as a first argument and a set as a second.\n* Can you think of any experiments to identify quantitative/qualitative difference between using regret vs marginal benefit? Could you think of any experiments to understand better why in some environments MBeED is not significantly different from MBeDED, but in some it is (e.g. in PitGap). What's so different between BipedalWalker and MiniGrid that makes DR~MBeDED on MiniGrid, but DR < MBeDED on some environments in Figure 4?\n* Some of the methods in Figure 4 does not seem to converge yet. Do you think asymptotically MBeDED and PLR will reach the same point? What happens if we train PLR longer for BipedalWalker-Hardcore?\n* Personally, I would get rid of Alice/Bob in the algorithm explanation and just use a time subscript to denote the policies in question. In my opinion, introducing more entities complicates the narrative."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The proposed environment generation objective, marginal benefit, seems to be practically flawed. It appears the agent from one update ago is used as the baseline, which is unlikely to be significantly different from the updated agent given the total number of updates (100k). Due to this, marginal benefit likely just approximates the variance in the cumulative return of the agent, returning high values when the updated agent happens to randomly sample a better trajectory. I would like to understand why this is not the case if the previous agent is used as the baseline, or how many updates are used if I am mistaken.\n2. As the state-of-the-art method on these UED domains, this method should definitely be evaluated against ACCEL. This is particularly pertinent as ACCEL is the most similar to this method, combining a generator strategy with curation. The reason for not evaluating ACCEL is missing, presumably due to a typo (bottom of page 7).\n3. Table 1 in the appendix is clearly inspired by Table 3 in the reference ACCEL publication (Parker-Holder et al., 2020), but is uncredited and omits ACCEL. This is borderline plagiarism, making it even more unclear why the method does not compare to ACCEL.\n4. It is difficult to draw any conclusions from the evaluation due to the majority of results being presented as training curves with no significance testing. The majority of these curves appear to show insignificant differences due to very high variance in performance, whilst on the plot presenting final performance median and IQR (Figure 7), the proposed method is insignificantly different to DR on every level (although this is not possible to establish exactly) and appears insignificantly different to PLR on the majority of levels. It would be very beneficial to see more seeds and significance testing based on final performance.\n5. There is no discussion or analysis of the Car Racing experiments, presumably due to a lack of space.\n6. The quality of the figures is lacking. Figure 1 is difficult to parse, the plot format in Figure 2 is inconsistent with the later plots, and Figures 3 and 6 add little information to the paper, so should be moved to the appendix to make room for e.g. the Car Racing evaluation."

Given that the test results are similar to prior works in Minigrid and CarRacing, a discussion comparing this method with PAIRED, and identifying any shortcomings of PAIRED that MBeDED addresses, would be beneficial. Prior research, such as [1] provides a thorough analysis in this area.\n\n[1]: Mediratta, I., Jiang, M., Parker-Holder, J., Dennis, M., Vinitsky, E., & Rockt\u00e4schel, T. (2023). Stabilizing Unsupervised Environment Design with a Learned Adversary. arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.10797.\n\n3. The results in CarRacing are only presented for three test tracks, in contrast to the twenty tracks used in PLR. A broader evaluation, including all test tracks in PLR, would better validate the robustness of the method. Similar is the case for Minigrid as well.\n\n4. As MBeDED's performance improves significantly when the diversity metric is applied, it would be advisable to move the DIPLR results from the appendix to the main section, and provide a detailed analysis on this aspect.\n\nIn its current state, the paper requires further analysis to convincingly argue why MBeDED should be preferred over existing methods like PAIRED or PLR. Additionally, the results presented appear selective/cherry-picked, necessitating a more comprehensive analysis to establish the method's robustness, to make this submission suitable for acceptance at this conference."

The paper introduces an alternative objective based on marginal benefit, which reflects the real improvement an agent experiences from an environment. They also propose a new scalable RL-based method for controlled environment generation that leverages this marginal benefit objective along with a novel concept of environment diversity. This method is posited to avoid issues like catastrophic forgetting and enable faster convergence of the agent's learning process. The paper's key contributions include defining marginal benefit for environment generation, introducing a scalable RL-based teacher for environment generation, and proposing a new mechanism for training on diverse environments."

                    "value": "### Experimental Results\n\nMy primary criticism regarding the work lies in the provided results, which do not align with those presented in prior papers. For instance, DR performs better than Robust PLR in 5 out of 6 MiniGrid environments. This directly contradicts the results in the PLR paper [1], presented at NeurIPS 2021 and made open-source since July 2022, casting doubts on the accuracy of all experiments presented in this work.\n- One notable difference is the number of steps for which the authors ran the experiments. For example, the MiniGrid results in the PLR are for 250 million steps, while those presented here are for only 100 million steps. This could potentially affect Robust PLR more, given it's conducting half the number of PPO updates.\n- Another discrepancy is in the number of seeds used. In the original paper, the authors use 10 seeds, whereas here it is reduced to 5, introducing more noise into the results.\n- Selective presentation of environments raises questions as well. It is unclear to me why the authors present results on Maze but omit results on Maze 2. Similarly, why only present results on 3 Formula 1 tracks rather than the entire set?\n\nNote: I completely understand that running these experiments for longer and with a higher number of seeds is computationally expensive. However, I believe it is important to adhere to fixed evaluation protocols for related works in the same field to allow for apples-to-apples comparisons where possible.\n\n### Other issues\n\n- There is prior work on utilizing diversity within the context of UED. Specifically, [2] adaptively identifies diverse environments using the Wasserstein distance measure, which is relevant to environment design. This work is not mentioned or compared against.\n- Why isn't the method compared to ACCEL? The authors provide only half a sentence on this topic, but the second half of the sentence is missing. I can surmise their reason might be that ACCEL uses editing; however, one could argue that the newly proposed framework could also incorporate editing. If that's the case, there would be an expectation to explore this possibility and compare the results.\n- What exactly is the MBeED approach? This term is first introduced in Section 3.2 as if it has already been explained, yet there is no previous mention of it. If it shares common procedures in the pseudocode with MBeDED, then this should be clearly stated, and potentially highlighted with color-coding in Algorithm 1.\n- The lines of pseudocode in Section 3.1 are incorrect. For instance, Line 10 does not correspond to the creation of new environments. It seems the authors wrote this section and then updated the pseudocode. Regardless, this needs to be fixed as it creates confusion.\"\n\nGiven the major issues in this work, particularly regarding experimental results, I recommend that the paper is rejected in its current form. That said, I am looking forward to discussing this work with the authors during the rebuttal.\n\n[1] Jiang el al, ****Replay-Guided Adversarial Environment Design****, https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02439\n\n[2] Li et al, **Generalization through Diversity: Improving Unsupervised Environment Design**, https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08025"
