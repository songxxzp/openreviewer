The experiments on a lung cancer dataset demonstrate promising results."

It would be interesting to see results for datasets where Vanilla model can solve the task, but using wrong (or unintuitive) features, for example in the shortcut learning setting. This would align better with the statement the authors made in the introduction (\u201cDL models achieve remarkable results, but with non-explainable features\u201d)"

Numerous papers have already explored the use of human rationales to enhance prediction accuracy [1,2,3]. Even within the specific context of lung cancer prediction, prior work has demonstrated the value of using human annotations [4]. It is crucial for the authors to distinguish their method, theoretically and empirically, from previously published work.\n2. The empirical evaluation of the method is somewhat lacking, with only one lung cancer prediction dataset used. There are numerous other vision tasks, such as Visual Question Answering, that could demonstrate the model's effectiveness. Furthermore, even within lung cancer prediction, there are multiple datasets available, such as NLST (https://cdas.cancer.gov/learn/nlst/images/). It is not feasible to accept this paper based solely on results from one dataset.\n3. The results in the paper are presented as a bar plot without any numerical values. For a scientific paper, it is imperative to include all raw data (accuracies) in a tabular format.\n\nHere are the related references that I found on google scholar in just 5 minutes:\n[1] Qiao, Tingting, Jianfeng Dong, and Duanqing Xu. \"Exploring human-like attention supervision in visual question answering.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.
