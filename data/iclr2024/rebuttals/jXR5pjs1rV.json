                    "value": "The paper addresses the limitations of current human feedback aligning methods which typically use a general reward model, failing to satisfy diverse, customized preferences. To address the issue, the authors created a DSP dataset consisting of user queries and corresponding responses from four domains. This dataset was used to train both general and domain-specific reward models. A three-stage training scheme is proposed, which involves a base language model training, a general RM fine-tuning, and customized RM fine-tuning. Multiple training and data strategies were tested across these stages to find ways to fit customized preferences while preserving the general preference capability of the models."

                    "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of developing personalized reward models for language model alignment. It highlights the importance of customizing reward models to cater to individual preferences or specific use-cases. The main contributions are the introduction of a novel synthetic preference dataset specifically designed for the customization of reward models, and a baseline training methodology employing multi-stage fine-tuning.\n\nThe paper explores the impacts of different configurations of the baseline training methodology on the performance of these customized reward models. This includes examining the role of an intermediate fine-tuning step with general preference datasets in enhancing final performance as well as the utilization of imitation-learning regulation in different stages of the training process. The latter aims to balance the fine-tuning process on smaller, personalized datasets, mitigating overfitting and maintaining generalization capabilities. Notably, the study indicates potential drawbacks of excessive fine-tuning steps, as can be seen by the relative performances of the Alpaca and LLaMA-based models.\nEmpirical results are presented to validate the proposed training techniques, offering insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.\n\nI enjoyed reading the paper and appreciate the direction of this research. I encourage the authors to continue to pursue this direction, address the current weaknesses and possibly extend their work for an even stronger submission in the future."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "### Primary concerns:\n\n- Limited Novelty of Baseline Approach: While the introduction of the benchmark dataset is innovative, the baseline approach proposed for addressing this dataset is somewhat derivative, primarily building upon the work by Askell et al. (2021). This is not in itself problematic if we consider the dataset to be the main contribution of the paper, but combined with the synthetic nature of the dataset it limits the significance of the contribution.\n\n- Synthetic Nature of Dataset: The use of a synthetic dataset, generated by a language model, raises concerns about its practical utility. The dataset might not adequately represent real-world complexities of individual preferences, as it is model-generated. In particular, the fact that a language model trained on general human preferences was able to generate these personas calls the need for customized reward models into question for this particular dataset. Addressing this limitation by incorporating or comparing with real human-generated data would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n- Lack of Baselines and Alternatives: Since (as mentioned in the previous point) prompted language models already show significant capability of customizing their outputs to align with the preferences described in their prompt, comparison of fine-tuned reward models to a prompted language model would further strengthen the contribution.\n\n- Lack of Policy-Level Evaluation: The paper focuses exclusively on reward-model level evaluation. Including policy-level evaluations, such as example outputs of language models fine-tuned with the customized reward models, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the practical applications and effectiveness of the approach.\n\n- Insufficient Discussion on Personalization: While the background on language-model specific alignment techniques is quite solid, the paper does not sufficiently explore prior work in personalization within the realms of general preference learning and information retrieval. Expanding the discussion to include these fields could provide a richer context and potentially lead to new directions to explore.\n\n### Secondary concerns:\n\n- Structural Improvements: The current structure of the paper could be optimized for better readability and impact. The paper currently puts large emphasis on the evaluation of the imitation learning generalization, although this is not the main contribution in my view. It could be improved by presenting the most promising results (Figure 11) first and only then discussing the ablations.\n\n- Clarity in Abstract and Terminology: The abstract could be a bit clearer. On first read, I did not understand what you mean by \"data strategies\", and \"training strategies\" is similarly vague. I suggest to be more explicit, i.e., explain that you test your method with varying combinations of datasets in the intermediate fine-tuning stage and that you evaluate the impact of \"imitation regularization\". The abstract could additionally explain the relation between individuals and domains better. As it is, it is slightly confusing that you first call for the need for individualized reward models but then propose a domain-specific (rather than individual-specific) dataset.\n\n### Minor points that have not impacted the score:\n\n- The sentence \"We discovered that imitation learning on customized preferences and general preference data enrichment are the two effective ways to preserve RMs\u2019 general preferring ability when fitting the customized human preferences.\" could use clarification. While I understand it after reading your entire paper, its meaning was not clear to me in the beginning. It would help to clarify what you mean by \"imitation learning on customized preferences\" (i.e., adding the imitation loss in addition to the comparison loss) and \"general preferring ability\".\n\n- The terms \"language modeling\" and \"LM coefficient\" are not quite self-explanatory, since the entire task is in a sense about language modeling. You mix those terms with \"imitation learning\" and \"imitation learning loss\", which I think cover the concept better.\n\n- The order of the figures and tables is sometimes confusing since it does not match the order in which they are discussed in the text. I think reordering them would improve the reading experience. An example of this are Figure 5 and 6, which should be swapped.\n\n- The conclusion of 4.4 (\"Although facilitated the general preference preservation, the imitation learning results on the GRFT stage are not satisfying enough for CRFT.\") only becomes clear in light of the later results with imitation-learning regularization for CRFT. It would help to rephrase that sentence.\n\n- While the paper is generally well written and articulated, there are some terms and phrases that struck me as a bit awkward and could benefit from rephrasing. Among them are \"pretraining with tremendous tokens\", \"guide the aligning directions\", \"helpfulness and harmlessness cover a wide range of mankind's tendencies\", \"general preference ability\" / \"preferring ability\" and \"costs a mess of annotation resources\" and \"let ChatGPT play as an assistant\"."

                    "value": "1. Could you describe your experimental setup in some more detail? What exactly does \"training samples\" on the X-axis on all the plots refer to?\n\n2. The motivation section suggests that high-quality customized reward models can enhance domain-specific LLM fine-tuning. However, reward-driven fine-tuning typically refines existing capabilities rather than adding new knowledge. Could you elaborate on how customized reward functions could enable language models to effectively handle novel application domains that LLMs fine-tuned with general preferences struggle with?\n\n3. You mention that the three-stage training scheme for customized RM training is one of your main contributions, yet acknowledge its similarity to the scheme proposed by Askell et al. (2021). Could you clarify if and how your training scheme differs from theirs?\n\n4. You note that collecting customized preferences from different persons could make the labeling task more difficult than gathering general preferences. Can you elaborate on why this is the case?\n\n5. Regarding the selection of instructions from the Alpaca dataset, you mention no requirement on the \"input\" key. Could you clarify what this means?\n\n6. In Figure 8, the term \"Llama Base\" is used. Could you clarify what this refers to? Is it \"Llama + LM(0.0)\"? Additionally, on which datasets are the models in this figure trained?"

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate Reviewer Kam2 for such an elaborate review, which provides us with a lot of inspiration and suggestions. We will take a hard look at the reviewer's concerns and further polish this work to be better.\n\nResponse to the reviewer's primary concerns:\n1. Novelty of Approach: we agree that the imitation learning method we used in GRFT and CRFT steps is similar to the PMP method in Askell et al.(2021). However, we use this imitation learning loss for a different purpose: PMP uses imitation learning to improve the performance of a general RM; we use imitation learning to preserve the general RM performance when learning a customized RM. Our main contribution to the methodology part is we find this imitation learning loss can enhance a new task CRFT, which is practically valued for many LLM customization scenarios.\n\n2. Synthetic Nature of Dataset: We agree that the dataset we release is somehow a synthetic dataset, at least not annotated by humans. We will extend this dataset with more complicated preferences and more large size. However, the main point of the DSP dataset is to quickly build scenarios for customized RM training and to quickly verify the effectiveness of DSP baseline approaches.\n\n3. Lack of Baselines: The reviewer provides a good suggestion to use the prompted LLM for evaluation as a baseline. We will add this baseline in the future revision. However, the performance of prompted LLM can be with high variance for the variety in prompt selection.\n\n4. Lack of Policy-Level Evaluation: Although we pay most of our attention to the RM learning task, we acknowledge that adding policy-level evaluation can further verify the effectiveness of the three-stage RM training scheme. However, evaluating domain-specific LLM can be far more challenging: we need annotators to act as a person from a particular domain, which requires additional annotation resources.\n\n5. Discussion on Personalization: We will add more personalization-related introductions in the future review. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nResponse to the reviewer's secondary concerns:\n\n1. Structural Improvements: we will reorder the experiments and highlight our discovery of imitation learning in the next revision.\n\n2. Clarity in Abstract and Terminology: We will make the abstract more clear. Our initial logic is: both domain-specific and individual-specific preferences are customized preferences. However individual-specific preferences are difficult to collect so we collect domain-specific preferences instead.\n\nFor the minor points, we appreciate the reviewer's careful check and will revise them in the draft.\n\nResponse to the reviewer's questions:\n\n1. \"training samples\" means the number of comparison pairs.\n\n2. Similar to primary concern 4, we will try to add policy-level experiments. However, the evaluation of domain-specific LLM remains challenging.\n\n3. The major difference between our three-stage training scheme and PMP is the training purpose: our training scheme is used for customized preference learning while preserving general preference performance, but PMP is used for general preferences. Besides, PMP uses far larger pretraining sets, while our scheme uses the PMP finetuning data on the GRFT step.\n\n4. When considering each person, the preference collection situation can be much more complicated. Because people can have agreement on some topics while having divergence on others. Moreover, the degree of divergence can be different depending on the person. It is challenging to collect preferences from a few annotators to reflect the variety of divergence to an appropriate degree.\n\n5. The queries in the Alpaca dataset contain two keywords: \"instruction\" and \"input\". While all queries include \"instruction\", some of them do not include \"input\". We simply exclude queries with \"input\" for simplification.\n\n6. Yes, \"Llama Base\" equals \"Llama + LM(0.0)\". The model is trained on the original HH dataset as for GRFT."
