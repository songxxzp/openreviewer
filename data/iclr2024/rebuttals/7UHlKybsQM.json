Note that efficient state reconstruction is an essential subroutine in quantum information processing. The main method combines circuit cutting and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). The paper demonstrates that highly entangled GHZ states can be efficiently reconstructed with high fidelity using very few measured samples of fragmented circuits."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for his/her constructive comments. We have revised the paper to bring better clarity to our method and results. The main method of using RBM to represent quantum states efficiently follows from the reference Carleo_2017 which we have added. We also tested the circuit by inserting the random unitary gates distributed according to Haar measure.  We have modified the Fig.3 to add the results with random unitary gates and ensure that our method can accurately reconstruct even random states. \nQuimb is a quantum simulator that can be used to simulate quantum circuits to mimick the one run by quantum computers. We apologize for omitting the reference for quimb and has added in the revised version. \nThe wavefunction is updated by updating the probability amplitude in Eq.(6) using Eq.(10). We have added reference Torlai 2018 that provides the details of updating wavefunction below Eq.(10).\nThe density matrix of a qubit is a complex Hermitian matrix of size 2 by 2. Hence, it can be represented by Pauli matrices {I,X,Y,X}. Each of them have two eigenstates and this leads to a total of 8 parameters in the summation of Eq.(1).\nWe note that estimating the theoretical limit is out of the scope of our paper.\nThe fidelity was calculated only for one training instance. We note that the fidelity will vary over 3% over the average value when the experiment is repeated for GHZ states. We have modified the text in the paper to note this. For random unitary circuits, the fidelity increases with the increase in the sample size. This is because GHZ states has only two outcomes either all |00000..00> state or |111..111> state. However, with random unitary gates since the outcome can be random basis states like 00..0, 100..0, 010..0 etc. Hence, more samples helps to increase the fidelity. We have modified the Fig.5 to add the results with random unitary gates."

However, we note that circuit cutting is a promising tool to simulate large quantum circuits with smaller quantum computers (currently available ones in the market). In our paper, we are trying to mimick the results from the actual quantum computer and  try to reconstruct the states that would have obtained if it were to run on a large one.  The reference mentioned by the reviewers are for the full circuit. We have emphasized in the paper that due to the entanglement that can be generated in the quantum circuits, state reconstruction after circuit cutting is a non trival task. Hence, it is more demanding than without cutting a circuit.\n The fidelity was calculated only for one training instance. We note that the fidelity will vary over 3% over the average value when the experiment is repeated for GHZ states. We have modified the text in the paper to note this.\nWe also tested the circuit by inserting the random unitary gates distributed according to Haar measure. In this case, the fidelity increases with the increase in the sample size. This is because GHZ states has only two outcomes either all |00000..00> state or |111..111> state. However, with random unitary gates since the outcome can be random basis states like 00..0, 100..0, 010..0 etc. Hence, more samples helps to increase the fidelity. We have modified the Fig.5 to add the results with random unitary gates."

To facilitate a more straightforward understanding of the primary novelty, it is advisable to explicitly introduce the fundamentals of quantum mechanics in Section 3.1. Additionally, for the benefit of readers, a comparison between notations in linear algebra and those in quantum physics should be provided to enhance clarity.\n\n2. The model of quantum state tomography should be introduced after the basic quantum mechanics.\n\n3. I am curious whether the method employed by the authors ensures the physical structure of the density matrix, including properties like positive semidefiniteness and unit trace. If this is not the case, it is essential for the authors to highlight this aspect.\n\n4. In addition to the method presented in this paper, the existence of low-dimensional structures, such as low-rankness [1] and matrix product operators [2], offers another avenue for decreasing the number of necessary repeated measurements. The reviewer recommends that the authors should consider introducing potential approaches for reducing the requirement for repeated measurements, both from hardware and theoretical perspectives.\n\n[1] J.

The main reason for concern here is the reported performance of the method vs. number of samples (Figure 5 and left panel of Figure 3), where the fidelity seems to degrade as the algorithm is given access to more measurement outcomes. The explanation for this strange behavior provided in the text (\"As the sample size is increased, the fidelity drops due to the overfitting of the data\") seems highly unlikely, as overfitting typically becomes _less_ of an issue as more training data is provided. In the similar work of [Perlin et al. (2021)] for example, the fidelity increases monotonically with sample count for every tomographic method tested, converging to a fidelity of 1 in the large sample limit for each case (see Fig. 5 of that work). In light of this, the fact that the authors' results doesn't show any meaningful improvement with greater access to samples is concerning.\n\n* The experiments supporting this method are fairly weak, in that they only consider a single simple type of quantum circuit. Although the authors compare the findings of this experiment to those of [Perlin et al. (2021)] (\"their reconstruction procedure requires 1 million samples whereas we attain the same fidelity with only 100 samples\"), this comparison is misleading, as the prior work tested their method against families of random circuits, clearly a more difficult task. I would encourage the authors to at least generalize their single GHZ example to a family of random quantum states, for example by adding random SU(2) rotations in the middle of the GHZ preparation circuit.\n\n* Having a direct comparison between the proposed method and past tomographic methods on the same quantum circuits would be helpful for assessing the performance of this method, as no comparison is offered to prior work that actually used this same family of quantum circuits."

We note that the fidelity will vary over 3% over the average value when the experiment is repeated for GHZ states. We have modified the text in the paper to note this.\nWe also tested the circuit by inserting the random unitary gates distributed according to Haar measure. In this case, the fidelity increases with the increase in the sample size. This is because GHZ states has only two outcomes either all |00000..00> state or |111..111> state. However, with random unitary gates since the outcome can be random basis states like 00..0, 100..0, 010..0 etc. Hence, more samples helps to increase the fidelity. We have modified the Fig.3 to add the results with random unitary gates. We still see that the fidelity can be improved though one needs more samples compared to GHZ states. \nWe note that comparison with Perlin et al. (2021) is not fair and hence we have removed the sentences from the paper where the comparison is made. However, we note that our method can accurately reconstruct even random states."
