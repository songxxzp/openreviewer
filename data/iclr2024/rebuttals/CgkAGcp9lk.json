However, I have no problem reading the paper \"Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder for Periodic Material Generation\". \n\nIn this paper, I understand the goal is to search for new HEA structures. But I don't understand how this is achieved by the work. I think the submission does not have a clear problem formuation, e.g. what is the structure of one training sample?\n\n Here is a list of detailed questions. \n\n1. In \"Dataset creation with MD\", what is one data point in the dataset? Is it a graph with node features? Could you give a clear definition of the sample space?\n\n2. \"Diffusion autoencoders are trained in a self-supervised manner, by removing the artificially induced noise of varying magnitudes from the data.\" What is the input to the model? How is the self-supervision task formed?\n\n3. The training of \"P-CDVAE\": is the phase an observed variable so that you can trained the denoising model to predict the phase? \n\n4. \"Local search for data augmentation\": the data augmentation seems to be different from data augmentation in machine learning. Here the local search is used to optimize some property of structure, instead of increasing training data. \n\n5. \"In order to cover the random ordering of the atoms in a specific point in the composition space,\" I don't see why node ordering should play a role here."

The data set includes DFT and MD simulations."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "I have a few important concerns that I would like to discuss.\n\nFirst of all, in my opinion the presentation and clarity of the manuscript could be largely improved. One challenge I faced throughout the paper is the difficulty to understand important details of the problem, methods and result. I believe that an important reason for this difficulty is the extensive used of materials or physics jargon. Even though I can safely say that my materials and physics background is stronger than the average machine learning researcher's, I had significant difficulty in following some sections. Therefore, I suspect that it would also be hard for most of the NeurIPS audience. To point at some examples, one is Section 3.4 Reconstruction Scores, which refers to multiple methods that will probably be unknown for the majority of the machine learning community, including many of those working in materials-related applications. Section 3.1 was also particularly difficult to parse for me. More generally, I think that especially Section 3 could be further adapted to the NeurIPS audience. As another example transversal to the entire paper, I would note that the concept of \"phase\" plays a central role throughout the paper but it is nowhere defined. While the specific meaning in materials discovery or specifically in the domain of high-entropy alloys will obvious to the people in the field, this is a word with multiple meanings depending on the domain, even in different physics subdomains. I would recommend to explain as much as possible such concepts taking into account the target audience of the conference.\n\nThere are other aspects of the presentation that could be improved, in my humble opinion. For instance, the use of the figures could better support the text and ideally be self-explanatory. Figure 1 is not referred to in the text and the three-letter caption does not help a lot in its interpretation. Figure 2 also has a very short caption and I have not been able to make sufficient sense out of it, even after carefully reading the text. If I understand correctly, Algorithm 1 in page 5 refers to the property optimisation described in Section 3.3. However, the caption is merely a title and the algorithm contains a multitude of variables that are barely described in the text. Incidentally, I would strongly recommend to use the LaTeX mathematical mode to write mathematical variables in the text (see, for instance, the second-to-last paragraph in Section 3.3).\n\nGenerally, one aspect of the presentation that could potentially be improved in multiple sections is that I found it difficult to understand what are the important pieces of information and what are less important details. I would recommend trying to devise a way to help the reader, of the machine learning community, understand the contributions of the paper, both with a clear structure and descriptions as well as with the help of diagrams. \n\nI found the discussion of the related work rather shallow. I think the paper effectively identifies relevant articles from the literature but falls short at putting them in context and explaining their relevance for the present manuscript.\n\nRegarding the contributions, while I acknowledge that the domain is mostly unexplored, I would also note that the proposed method is a slight modification of the existing CDVAE and that the data set and experimental evaluation is limited to a specific alloy (NiFeCr). Therefore, it is uncertain whether the proposed framework will be applicable to other alloys and whether future research can easily build upon this work."

It is not clear to me whether this metric is used as a replacement for the \nreconstruction error of the CDVAE during training or if it is only used as a final evaluation metric. And why is it important to only score the local structure. And if it is better than the usual reconstuction error of the VAE, why is it not used as the cost function for training? In 4.4 the authors write that the model is able to find bulk modulus that are similar to the values found during local search. How much faster is the search using the model vs the local search that doesn't use machine learning? Did the model use the local search data for training? If that is the case we don't really gain anything from using the model.\n\nOverall the presented results might be good and sound, but the framing of the paper and each experiment is not clear enough\nto make a judgement about the soundness of the results."
