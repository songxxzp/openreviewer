While typos can generally happen, I think there should not be any typo in the title of a submitted conference paper.\n\n- In the Abstract, you mention \u201cneural representations\u201d in the second sentence. I am not sure I can follow. What does \u201cneural representations\u201d mean here? The representations of an artificial neural network? The representations in a human brain? This does not come across clearly. The term has to be defined before.\n\n- I tried really hard reading this paper but it is incredibly poorly written. I cannot follow at most times. \n\n- I am not really sure I understand what is going on here in general. I have never heard of CG, PS, or any of the datasets they evaluated their method on. Most settings seem to be contrived. \n\n- On page 6, the authors claim that \u201c[...], PS offers a potential approach to understanding deep neural networks, with mechanisms resembling those of the human brain, which may lead to more interpretable and transparent AI.\u201d I highly doubt that. It is not even clear to me how PS could help \u201cunderstand neural nets with mechanisms that resemble the human brain\u201d\n\n- In Figure 2, the standard deviations are incredibly large and overlap between their regularization technique and vanilla logistic regression. So, what this figure shows is that there is no difference between their method and logistic regression. I am not sure what else I should take away from this figure.\n\n- What is the baseline? They compare their method against a baseline but it is unclear to me which method the baseline is. It does not seem to be explained anywhere. Is the baseline logistic regression? Or am I missing something crucial?"

The Introduction motivates the use of the parallelism score from neuroscience studies, but it turns out that incorporating this score to the training objective does not fix the problem. The authors thus additionally proposed a regularization based on \u201cminimal distance variances\u201d.\n\nWhile the results show some improvements, their significance is unclear.

They then validate this score by creating datasets with a variety of levels of parallelism (and variance) and measure the correlation of accuracy of downstream linear classifiers trained on these datasets with the known parallelism of the datasets. They indeed show that their metric is correlated with compositional generalization (accuracy on unseen combinations of inputs requiring abstract generatlization) on these synthetic datasets. Further, they test this correlation with a wide variety of pre-trained models, and three separate test datasets, again showing highly robust correlation, validating their metric.\n\nThey then introduce a version of their parallelism score which can be used as a regularization term, and prove that it is an unbiased estimator, allowing for robust optimization. They improve this regularization term with a sort of maximum margin loss they call \u2018distance variance\u2019 to avoid certain failure cases. Finally, they test models using this regularization term on four datasets: Shapes3D, PACS, Office-Home, and NICO. They show that their model achieves the highest accuracy on these datasets when compared to simple baselines, and further ablation experiments validate the positive impact of their additional terms."

This is a perspective which has to-date not been given significant attention in the machine learning community, however it has been demonstrated to be highly relevant in biological systems, and therefore the increased attention is very welcomed. Furthermore, this adds to the originality and significance of the paper.\n- The paper's methodology appears fairly rigorous and sound, where they perform a fairly extensive evaluation to validate that their proposed score correlates with generalization on both synthetic and real data with a suite of pretrained models and datasets.\n- The paper achieves the goal of improving compositional generalization through an induced parallelism (although the results on that front are quite limited)."
