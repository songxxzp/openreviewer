The authors should provide a more detailed theoretical analysis to highlight the merits of InfoIGL.  The paper could include more ablation studies to further validate the significance of each component in the InfoIGL framework. The authors could provide more comprehensive comparisons with widely-known baselines in the field.\n\n\n- Evaluations are only conducted on the graph classification task in limited scenarios.

Good theoretical derivation and mathematical proof: in this paper, information theory, contrast learning, variational inference and other mathematical knowledge are used to gradually reduce the goal of identifying invariance on graphs, approximate calculation, decomposition into small steps that can be performed, and make it have theoretical assurance through rigorous mathematical proof.\n\n3.

Although this paper converts the goal of identifying invariance on graphs into reducing redundant information and maximizing mutual understanding by means of approximate substitution and mathematical reduction, etc. However, these derivation methods are the application of existing works, mostly. Second, the degree of relaxation is kind of large, and thus the invariable learning is transformed into contrastive learning in general. There are questions whether the so-called invariance learned in this way is valid and should be further explained.\n\n2. Weak contribution in methods: The core methods of InfoIGL are attention mechanism and graph contrastive learning, which are direct application of existing works and lack of necessary innovation. Apart from the theoretical derivation of the first half, all that is left of this paper is a graph contrastive learning framework, which means that the authors believe invariant identification can be achieved through contrastive learning. I think it needs further investigation.\n\n3. Confusing experiment setups: In terms of data sets, although a benchmark dataset of graph OOD is adopted (GOOD), the selected data sets are kind of small and have less value in the real world (like CMNIST). In addition, the visualization experiment only demonstrated the embeddings of InfoIGL variants and its own, not compared to baselines. And there is a lack of visual experiments on the interpretability, i.e., which parts of the graph are more important to label predictions? This is also the problem proposed in this paper, but there is no relevant experiment.\n\n4. Mutual information is viewed as measurement of invariance directly and heuristically. Though the theoretical proof seems solid and sufficient, I would like to see more clear and easy-to-follow examples."
