The framework combines dx-privacy-based relaxed local Differential Privacy (DP), U-shape split inference, and a client-side denoiser based on the Transformer architecture. This innovative approach delivers efficient computation, privacy guarantees, and strong utility for private LLM inference. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework using four datasets and three different architectural configurations. The results illustrate that the model maintains high utility while preserving a substantial privacy budget, with minimal computational complexity overhead."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer NdAW,\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your comment. Hope our additional experiments and clarifications could address your concerns.\n\n**Q1. Privacy concerns of denoise model.**\n\nThe training of denoise model relies solely on the public dataset, and thus the denoise model is irrelavant to the private data. We added the clarification at the end of Section 3.4. Furthermore, the input to the denoise model requires the knowledge of specific noise matrix, which is not accessible by the server.\n\n**Q2. The impact of knowing the noise level or not**\n\nWe added theoretical (see Section 3.4) and empirical studies (see Section A.10) to assess the impact of noise level awareness. For theoretical analysis, we showed that the denoising ability is inherently in tension with the level of privacy protection and provided a lower bound on the MSE of denoised results. For empirical analysis, we run the experiment that deploys the denoise model on server side using only privatized token representations as input. The results show that SnD significantly outperforms the server-side denoise method by over 10% in almost all cases for MRPC task.\n\n**Q3. Empirical evaluation of privacy protection & different $\\eta$s**\n\nRefering to general response to Q1, we added experiment considering the inference attacks in Section 4.3 and 4.4.3. We found that the three classes of models show different robustness exhibit distinct robustness against inference attacks, and thus the privacy budget varies across the models. The $\\eta$ is selected that meets the following two criteria simultaneously: (a) the accuracy for embedding inversion attack is below 0.01, and (b) the accuracy for attribute inference is below 0.53 (the accuracy for random guessing is around 0.5). \n\nRegarding the interpretation of $\\eta$, it can be viewed as a parameter controlling the indistinguity between the distribution of the randomized mechnisms with two possible inputs $x$, $x'$. The log-likelihood ratio of observing any particular output $y$ given two inputs $x$, $x'$ is bounded by $\\eta d(x, x')$, where $d(x, x')$ is the distance metric of the two inputs. In this paper, we adopted the Euclidean norm as the distance metric.\n\n**Q4. Typo errors and expression issues**\n\nThanks for pointing out. We corrected the typos and used consistent $\\eta$ in the paper.\n\n**Q5. Extension to training/finetuning**\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. While the privatization method described in our paper can be utilized during the training stage, directly applying the denoise model to the training/finetuning stage would pose a significant challenge. It would be another field of research to protect LLM training with local differential privacy while maintaining utility.\n\n**Q6. Limitations of $d_{\\chi}$-differential privacy**\n\nThe method proposed by \"Mattern et al. - The Limits of Word Level Differential Privacy\" couldn\u2019t be directly applied to our framework, as it involves repharasing the sentence and thus is not compatible with the denoise model. Indeed, $d_{\\chi}$-DP has been used frequently for text inputs in recent research [1]. Below we present some discussions on the weakness of the $d_{\\chi}$-DP bound:\n\n-\tLinear growth of privacy budget with token length. In the experiment, we limited the input length within 512 tokens. We also conducted inference attack on the privatized token representations to verify the privacy protection capability. Furthermore, in Section A.11, we show that our approach retains the performance even under extremely low privacy budgets, indicating that the user could set a very low privacy budge in case of possible leakage for long text inputs.\n-\tLack of syntactic changes. The syntactic properties of the original text could be hided when the privacy budget is set to a very low level.\n-\tLimitation for usefulness of the text data on local DP. To preserve the utility of the subsequent output, we deploy a denoise model on user side to conduct error correction.\n\n[1] Feyisetan, O., Balle, B., Drake, T., & Diethe, T. (2020, January).

Such an evaluation is crucial to assessing the feasibility of the proposed approach. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the denoise model, pre-trained on the server, can adapt to varying noise levels determined by clients.\n\n- Lack of details on baseline description\n\nThere is a lack of detail in the baseline description. The only information provided about the benchmark method is \"where the token embeddings are perturbed by the user before sending them to the server\". It would be beneficial to provide more information about TokEmbPriv and explain why this method was chosen as the sole benchmark in the evaluation. Additionally, it would be helpful to clarify why other methods, such as a vanilla model, were not considered in the comparison.\n\n- The evaluation on denoise is somehow blur\n\nThe evaluation of the denoising process is somewhat unclear. Please explicitly state and explain why a higher Cosine Similarity score between the initial and recovered embeddings is indicative of better performance. Also, please provide a clear definition of what \"initial embeddings\" refer to. If they pertain to the embeddings input to the denoise module, i.e., the \"output noised results\" in Figure 1, it currently reads as though having fewer differences between the initial and recovered embeddings is preferred, which might lead to less noise added. Additionally, the evaluation appears to focus solely on accuracy and does not provide results on privacy protection.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer C4Af,\n\nThanks for your comments. Hope our modifications and answers below could address your concerns.\n\n**Q1. The overhead of proposed approach**\n\nWe added experiment in Appendix A.9 to evaluate overhead of SnD. Refer to the general response to Q3.\n\n**Q2. Denoise model for varying $\\eta$ levels**\n\nIn Appendix A.6 we added the specification of training the denoise model. Simply speaking, we devide the $\\eta$ in to three groups according to the correlation between the privatized and plain token representation tokens, and train a seperate denoise model for each group. During inference, the user could choose the corresponding denoise model based on their privacy requirement.\n\n**Q3. Baseline description & lack of baseline**\n\nRefering to the answer to Q2 in general response, we added two baselines in the experiments. We also present more illustration of the baseline methods in \u201cprior works\u201d and Appendix A.1. The accuracy performance for a vanilla model is presented in the case of $\\eta=\\infty$ in table 1, 2, and 3, where no noises are added and denoise model is not deployed on user side.\n\n**Q4. Privacy performance of the proposed method**\n\nRefering to general response to Q1, we added experiment considering the inference attacks in Section 4.3 and 4.4.3.\n\n**Q5. Interpretation of Cosine Similarity**\n\nThe cosine similarity measures the similarity between the clean and denoised embeddings in the case of SnD (or privatized embedding in the case of text2text and tokEmbPriv). Clean embedding refers to the output embedding computed from the plain token embeddings, and denoised embedding refers to the output embedding derived from the privatized token embeddings and transformed by the denoise model. A higher cosine similarity means that the denoised embedding is more similar to the original clean embeddings and thus is prefered. We make the expression clearer in Section A.8."

SnD splits at the embedding layer, where local differential privacy (LDP) is applied to user embedding vectors for obfuscation.  Along with the embedding layer, the client side also contains a trained denoiser which, after the output embedding vectors are transmitted from the server, is used to denoise the response.  Several experiments are conducted demonstrating the efficacy of this work, compared to another method designed specifically for BERT (i.e., TokEmbPriv from Qu et al, 2021), across several models (BERT/DistillBert, T5, and GPT-2) for three classification tasks."

The presented framework makes sense in this context, although the overall approach could be better motivated.  For instance, why split at the embedding layer?  Splitting at this particular layer is the most unsecure, even for a simple man in the middle attack (given a pretrained foundation model).  However, splitting at any other layer and transmitting gradients naturally allows for federated learning strategies and the avoidance of DP altogether.  Furthermore, multi-party computation (MPC) methods do not have the encountered problem of trying to use DP with split learning (and properly denoising transmitted data).  A contrast and discussion of these various approaches is warranted.

                    "value": "# Autoregressive LLM concerns regarding the (only) use of GPT-2 and evaluation \n\nThe featured classification tasks do well to test the performance of BERT and T5.  However, they do not relevantly test the performance of GPT-2; in practice, GPT-2 does not perform well on classification tasks, which would ideally be handled by more appropriate encoder (e.g., BERT) or encoder-decoder (e.g., T5) architectures.  More relevant generative metrics, such as sentence completion (e.g., via HellaSwag), next-word-completion (e.g., via the lambada dataset), or even perplexity are required to show that GPT-2 performance is maintained.  Furthermore, - GPT-2 itself is an older model and was trained in a much less complicated manner compared to recently released (instruction-tuned) models, such as LLaMa-2, Falcon, Mistral, etc..  Testing on a more recent architecture is important to show the efficacy of this approach, to show that the more sophisticated pretrained knowledge (which naturally contains many more learned modalities/instructions compared to GPT-2) still behaves as expected, and to show different architectural choices are unaffected by the introduced noise (e.g., LLaMa uses RMSNorm vs GPT-2's Layernorm, which, relevant to the presented work, directly impacts how these models deal with noise variation in the data).\n\n# Lack of: (a) comparison to other relevant privacy-preserving methods, (b) evidence against competitors infeasibility\n\nBeyond TokEmbPriv, comparison is lacking to other relevant benchmark competitors.  E.g., due to the similarity of both approaches, a comparison to RAPT (Li et al. (2023)) is necessary.  Furethermore, for homomorphic encryption approaches, the authors claim:\n> Cryptographic typically employs homomorphic encryption (HE) to compute the inference result of the users\u2019 encrypted input. Unfortunately, the application of cryptographic technique is constrained by the significant computation overhead of cryptographic operations, especially on large transformer models.\n\nTo assert this claim, the proposed method and reference HE methods should be compared in terms of both accuracy, privacy-preserving ability, and wall-clock time.\n\n# Inaccurate claims\n> To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the pioneering effort in protect user\u2019s privacy during LLM inference with strong privacy guarantee. Existing research focuses on the privacy-preserving pre-training and fine-tuning for LLM, while few studies pay attention to the privacy concerns at inference stage, especially on privatizing user\u2019s input to guarantee DP.\n\nThe homomorphic encrpytion work by Liu & Liu (2023); Chen et al. (2022) (cited in the paper) protects user privacy during inference, please withdraw or appropriately revise this claim.\n\nFurthermore, the description of RAPT (which itself offers LDP for privacy-preserving LLM inference) is inaccurate:\n> An alternative strategy might entail input text perturbation via textto-text privatization or synthetic data generation, preserving high-dimensional features while altering human-perceivable sequences Li et al. (2023). Specifically, the text\\\n-to-text privatization projects text into a high-dimensional vector space with a pre-determined word embedding model,adding\ncarefully calibrated noise to the vector representation, and then reconvert it to obtain the perturbed\ntext Feyisetan et al. (2019); Qu et al. (2021a). Yet, the mere application of this technique during\ninference does not guarantee a satisfactory balance between privacy and utility\n\nThis is a misleading description of the RAPT method from Li et al. (2023); RAPT performs LDP to user prompts (thus establishing certifiable privacy via DP).  In order to recover performance on the noisy data, RAPT employs prompt tuning to efficiently fine-tune a server-side model capable of performing inference on the LDP data.  This approach is extremely similar to the proposed split-and-denoise framework.  Please clearly describe RAPT and contrast it to SnP, while also benchmarking against it as a relevant competitor.\n\n> Split learning Gupta & Raskar (2018); Vepakomma et al. (2018) ... DP is employed to mitigate privacy leakage by injecting noises into the IRs before sharing with the server.\n\nNeither of the two papers use DP to certifiably protect the data.  Please cite another multi-party computation paper (where intermediate gradients are distributed across networks) which uses DP\n\n# Lack of demonstrated efficacy against attacks\n\nIt is necessasry to prove the privacy-preserving capabilities of the presented approach, e.g., simulate eavesdropping attacks, which collect intercepted embedding vectors (during transmission to the server) for malicious actions (e.g., embedding inversion and attribute inference attacks).  Please see Li et al. (2023) for examples and more details."

Subsequently,\nthis trained model is deployed on the user side, where it leverages the specific noise levels\nand raw IRs provided by the user to enhance the embeddings.\n\nCan the authors comment on how this necessarily opens up a large security hole? I.e., the data has noise injected to protect it in the event of interception by a bad actor.  However, this scheme requires the transmission of the actual denoising layer, which itself may be intercepted.  Due to the need for model refreshes, this problem is non-trivial.\n\n> Split learning is a novel privacy-preserving approach in distributed learning\n \nPlease remove \"novel\", as it not being introduced in the presented work.\n\nThe benchmarked method, \"TokEmbPriv,\" requires significantly more discussion during the background and previous work sections.\n\nThe paper requires an editing pass."

Testing of GPT2 on classification task**\n\nThe autoregressive GPT model has been evaluated on classification tasks in recent research [1]. Furthermore, OpenAI has released the Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) for downstream tasks including classification [2], where GPT2 and 3 are provided as the underlying models. Therefore, it\u2019s of pratical concerns to test the performance of GPT2 on the downstream tasks given by the paper. Meanwhile, we are conducting experiment of GPT2 on HellaSwag and lambada dataset, but we haven't completed it due to computer resource and time limit. We will add the results to the paper once the experiments are done.\n\n**Q2. Comparison to other baselines**\n\nWe added the comparison of SnD with more privacy-preserving LLM inference methods. In Section 4.1 and 4.4.2, we compare the auc of SnD on downstream tasks with text2text and RAPT. Benefiting from the denoise model, our method results in AUC higher than the three baselines with an average over 10\\%. \n\nIn Section A.9, we evaluated the computation and communication overhead for two encryption-based method [3] [4], and found that our method results in thousands of speedup for the SOTA HE algorithms. The privacy comparison between PCFT and SnD can be found in Section A.1, where PCFT adopts the security definition in multiparty computation while SnD protect the data with LDP.\n\n**Q3. Difference between RAPT and SnD**\n\nIn Section A.1, we illustrated the distinction between RAPT and our framework. Though RAPT employs a reconstruction head to improve the robustness against noises during prompt-tuning stage, *the module only reconstruct the random tokens and doesn\u2019t perform any direct denoise either on the privatized input or the corresponding representations/activations for the private token.* Furthermore, *the reconstruction head is discarded during the inference stage, rendering no denoise mechanism for LLM inference.* In constrast, our work performs explicit local denoise for the output embedding on the user-side, which demonstrates better performance.\n\n**Q4. Privacy-preserving capabilities**\n\nRefer to the general response of Q1, we added experiment considering the inference attacks in Section 4.3 and 4.4.3. Such attack could be carried out by an eavesdropper or the curious server.\n\n**Q5. Privacy concerns for denoising layer**\n\nThe training of denoise model relies only on the public dataset, and thus the denoise layer release no information about the private data. We added the clarification at the end of Section 3.4. \n\n**Q6. Inaccurate claims**\n\nWe rewrited the claims and highlighted them in blue.\n\n[1] Radford, A., Narasimhan, K., Salimans, T., & Sutskever, I. (2018).

Testing of GPT2 on classification task\n\n> The autoregressive GPT model has been evaluated on classification tasks in recent research [1]. Furthermore, OpenAI has released the Embedding-as-a-Service (EaaS) for downstream tasks including classification [2], where GPT2 and 3 are provided as the underlying models. Therefore, it\u2019s of pratical concerns to test the performance of GPT2 on the downstream tasks given by the paper. Meanwhile, we are conducting experiment of GPT2 on HellaSwag and lambada dataset, but we haven't completed it due to computer resource and time limit. We will add the results to the paper once the experiments are done.?\n\nIt is important to note that the EaaS solution by OpenAI is not the same as evaluating/reporting GPT-2 performance on classification tasks.  EaaS uses a given model's embedding matrix as a feature store (i.e., vector DB) to be passed onto other models for different downstream tasks (e.g., OpenAI gives an example of training regressors/classifiers from sklearn using embedding vectors).  This is inherently not the same as training an autoregressive LLM, such as GPT-2, to perform classification tasks.  I look forward to the HellaSwag and Lambada results.\n\nThank you for including both more attack use cases and comparison to more competitors.  Can you please add more implementation details on how competitors were run?  E.g., for all approaches which use DP, what privacy thresholds were used? \n How were the methods implemented (e.g., software version, when avaiable)?  How were hyperparameters chosen to fairly reflect all considered algorithms performance?  Note that RAPT uses the reconstruction head during training to force that the LLM can naturally decode the LDP tokens; it is not surprising the reconstruction head may thus be discarded during inference, and the ability of the LLM to naturally decode the LDP tokens is the entire selling point of RAPT.  Furthermore, some discussion on the limitations of TokEmbPriv is still warranted; this method was specifically designed and tested for BERT models (this limitation can be described in the authors' favor), why would it be expected to perform well applied to GPT-2?  Please note these limitations/explanations of performance within the text."

Hope the revision and answers below could address your concern.\n\n**Q1. Testing of GPT2 on classification task.**\n\nOur EaaS model works similar to OpenAI's solution. Instead of finetuning GPT2 on the classification task, we employ the LLM model to extract embeddings and use the embeddings as the feature score to train a separate classification model on the downstream task. For more details refer to A.5. We also mention this point in Table 7 of Section A.1.\n\n**Q2. Implementation details on how competitors were run**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have added the implementation details in section A.6.1 and A.6.5. Noted that all DP methods utilizes the same $d_{\\chi}$-privacy with Euclidean distance as metrics.\n\n**Q3. RAPT's reconstruction head**\n\nWe understand that the reconstruction head help the model to better understand the privatized input. Since the reconstruction module works solely on decoding random tokens, we note that the precise mechanism by which the LLM learns to decode the privatized tokens remains unclear. We updated the expression to be more precise in Section A.1.\n\n**Q4. Discussion on the limitations of TokEmbPriv**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We included the discussions on the limitation of TokEmbPriv and Text2Text in Section 4.4.2. The lack of  denoise mechanism and unbounded noise support in TokenEmbPriv might lead to its poorer performance in downstream task."

In particular, only the token embedding is done on the client side to keep the computational cost low for clients. \n\n2) Privatising clients submissions: Differential privacy is employed to mitigate privacy leakage by injecting noises into the embedding before sharing with the server. In particular, each client adds noise to their embedding prior to sending them to the server to protect the privacy of clients while doing LLM inference;\n\n3) Server-side computation: the server receives the noisy embedding, and performs the rest of the computations of the LLM and returns the noisy output to the client.\n\n4) Client-side denoising: Each client performs denoising to improve the utility of the output. The denoise model is pre-trained on the server side using public datasets and synthetic noises, and subsequently shared with the client."

This paper instantiates the denoising model as an L layer transformer-based model that receives the privatised token representations, noise matrix and noisy output computed by the server. Although this denoise model is pre-trained on the server side using public datasets and synthetic noises, each client needs to do the inference of this denoising model locally. Unfortunately, this paper does not empirically evaluate the memory and computational cost of this inference for clients. Therefore, it is not clear if this overhead is any smaller than running the whole LLM on the client side. This evaluation is necessary as one main claim of this paper is that the proposed method introduces only affordable local computations for clients.\n\n2) No evidence demonstrating the privacy benefits of the proposed method. This paper lacks an empirical evaluation of the privacy leakage of the proposed method. This is particularly important as analytical privacy guarantees chosen by this paper are very loose for example see privacy budgets of 100, 500 and 1000 in the Tables provided in the experiment section.\n\n\n3) Shallow discussion of results and not considering SOTA models. \n\n4) Experimental choices including hyperparameters and privacy budgets are not justified/studied and they are not consistent across models.

Evidence to support the practicality of the proposed method.** \n\nWe added experiment in Appendix A.9 to compare the computation and memory cost of user-side inference of SnD with the case where the whole model is downloaded. The computation time and memory cost saves by SnD ranges from, respectively, 78% to 96% and 65% to 94%, across the 10 models. The saving is more significant for models of large size, such as GPT2 Xlarge.\n\n**Q2. Evidence for the privacy benefits & consistence of privacy budget.**\n \nWe added embedding inversion attack and attribute inference attacks to verify the privacy protection cabilities under different $\\eta$s in Section 4.4.3 and 4.3. We found that the three classes of models show different robustness exhibit distinct robustness against inference attacks, and thus the privacy budget varies across the models. The $\\eta$ is selected that meets the following two criteria simultaneously: (a) the accuracy for embedding inversion attack is below 0.01, and (b) the accuracy for attribute inference is below 0.53 (the accuracy for random guessing is around 0.5). Noted that we have updated the privacy budget for GPT2 to be 1, 50, 100. We also added evaluation for the performance of extremely low privacy level in Appendix A.11.\n\n**Q3.  Shallow discussion of results.** \n\nWe enhance the discussion in the Section 4. Compared with the vanilla model, Bert, T5, and GPT models yield average model losses of 4.31\\%, 4.48\\%, and 5.25\\%, respectively. In addition, SnD outperforms the baselines by an average of over 10\\% benefiting from the denoise model. More details are presented in our paper.\n\n**Q4. Typos**\n\nWe have corrected the typos and conducted grammer check on the paper."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer 4SyG,\n\nThanks for your reply. We uploaded a revised version based on your suggestions. Hope our further clarification and revisions could address your concern.\n\n**Q1. How do you measure the computation costs and what is its unit in Table 12?**\n\nThe computation costs are in second, which is indicated by the caption of Table 12.\n\n**Q2. Communication costs of encryption-based methods**\n\nThe high communication cost is caused by the multiparty computation techniques adopted by the methods. Instead of only uploading the encrypted data to the server, the client and server transmit the secret shares as well as encrypted versions of intermediate values obtained from a series operations in the LLM. For more details refer to the secure computation protocols in [1] and [2]. I included this point in A.9.\n\n**Q3. Figure 5 confirms my concern that the computation costs of your method is high and very close to the computation costs of running the whole LLM locally on the user's device.**\n\nWe are afraid that there might be some misunderstanding. It's important to note that our results reveal significant computation benifit of SnD compared with whole LLM inference. According to the Figure, SnD saves the computation cost by an average of over 85%, and in particular 95.3% for GPT2 Xlarge, compared with running the whole LLM locally. We also added more explanations in the caption of figure 5 to make it clearer.\n\n**Q4. The y-axis is in seconds I would not show it with the steps size of $10^{-2}$ to not be misleading please.**\n\nCould you make further illustration on this suggestions? Seems like there are some confusions on our side. We will strive to make the figure clearer based on your advice.\n\n**Q5. The description of your embedding inversion attack is missing**\n\nThe description of embedding inversion attack is presented in Section 4.3. The server recover the tokens from the privatized token embedding based on the L_2 distance.\n\n**Q6. How strong is your attack? Is it an existing SOTA attack or is it something that you designed.**\n\nThe attacks have been adopted in existing research to verify the effectiveness of SOTA methods [3][4]. We added the citation after each attack in Section 4.3.\n\n**Q7. Figure 2 misses labels for its x-axis and y-axis.**\n\nThanks for pointing out. We added the labels in the latest version. The x-axis denotes the privacy budget and y-axis denotes attack accuracy.\n\n**Q8. It is not clear if the attack is performed on the embedding obtained by your method or not?**\n\nThe attack is performed on the privatized token embedding obtained by our method. We included this point in Section 4.3.\n\n**Q9. Figure 2 misses a discussion.**\n\nThe discussion for Figure 2 is presented in Section 4.4.3.\n\n[1] Liu, X., & Liu, Z. (2023).
