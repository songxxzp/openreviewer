The proposed method leverages contrastive loss to recover the trigger by comparing the feature outputs of a clean model and the suspicious model. Once the trigger is generated, clean images and images with triggers are fed into the model to check if it has backdoor. If the model has backdoor, techniques similar to Neural Cleanse will be used to remove the backdoor. Experiments show that the proposed method good against two backdoor attacks on three image datasets compared to several centralized backdoor defense method."

If there exists a set of clean data for the server, it does not align with the goal of federated learning.\n\n- In the experiments, only centralized backdoor defense methods are compared with the proposed method. There have been so many backdoor defense methods proposed for federated learning the past years.

The contrastive loss is designed to discern differences in responses between a clean model and a backdoored model, ultimately generating the exact trigger. Once the trigger is generated, it is used to detect and cleanse the backdoored model. This technique has been demonstrated to be effective against two attack scenarios with different architectural backbones in a standard federated learning setting. The comparative analysis reveals that it is more effective than existing methods."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The proposed method has a significant limitation concerning the existence of a clean model. The authors assert that the public model should be from a verified old version of the global model or a renowned pre-trained model that lacks a backdoor. This assumption is practical and bold. In the former case, addressing how to perform the verification when backdoors might occur early in training is not specified. In the latter case, the restriction of needing a publicly available model limits the application. Furthermore, the appendix results support that the defense fails if the clean model's accuracy performance is too poor.\n2. Another limitation is the method's capability to defend only small patches, as noted in the appendix.\n3. The experimental details regarding the contrastive loss function and the backdoor attack are lacking. Specifics like the target class (which class?) in the backdoor attack and how the Attack Success Rate (ASR) is calculated (e.g., whether it excludes images from the target class) should be provided.\n4. While the design itself is logical, there is no guarantee that the final convergence point is exactly (or close to) the real backdoor trigger. The paper should discuss how to guarantee such a strong connection.\n5. There isn't strong evidence provided to suggest that this method is only suitable for Federated Learning models. The paper should elaborate on why this approach is particularly suited for Federated Learning models.\n6. The paper does not discuss performance against knowledgeable (adaptive) attackers.\n7. The method assumes that attackers are effective and stealthy, but it lacks a clear definition of \"stealthy.\" The paper should also consider scenarios where the attacker's objective is not necessarily about being stealthy.\n8. Some missing literature should be involved into discussion: \n\n[1] Ozdayi et al. - Defending against Backdoors in Federated Learning with Robust Learning Rate\n\n[2] Zhang et al. - Flip: A provable defense framework for backdoor mitigation in federated learning\n\n[3] Rodr\u00edguez-Barroso et al. - Backdoor attacks-resilient aggregation based on Robust Filtering of Outliers in federated learning for image classification"

Moreover, the paper overlooks defenses like RLR that employ modified loss functions to avert backdoor injections. There is a significant lack of comparative analysis with these established works, which undermines the paper's contribution to the existing body of research on this subject.\n\nThe paper also overlooks evaluating the proposed defense against state-of-the-art attacks such as Neurotoxin, 3DFed, etc.\n\nThe datasets employed in the experimental assessment are quite basic. Additionally, the evaluation overlooks the non-IID data distributions from the LEAF benchmark. The functionality of backdoor trigger reverse-engineering and unlearning in real-world non-IID scenarios remains unclear."

Neither the method is dedicated to the federated learning such that it considers the heterogeneity problems or the communication costs. \n\n3. The existence of M_c is not well justified. Why does such model exists in the federated scenario. Does the server owns it or the user owns it? If the server, how does the model trained. \n\n4. Why this paper achieves better efficiency is not well justified. Do previous methods have a sequential dependency over the class such that they has to proceed in certain order or it were just the implementation? \n\n5. The contribution of this paper is limited. It simply add a contrastive loss to the reverse engineering problem and perform experiments to show the performance without any deep insights."

Is it compute the loss as one batch or there is no sequential dependency? \n\n2. \"where the trigger image is updated by\ncomparing the feature outputs of the clean model and the suspicious model through THE contrastive\nloss.\" What is THE contrastive loss?"
