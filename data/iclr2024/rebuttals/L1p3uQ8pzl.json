They find that while LLMs can memorize facts about the Pok\u00e9mon world, they struggle with logical inconsistencies. To address this, they propose a new self-supervised learning method called \"Self-Training with Self-Competition,\" which allows the model to better adapt to new and unknown settings."

                        "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**W2&Q1** why LLMs face logical inconsistencies about the Pokemon world\n\nAs we have discussed in the paper, LLMs will encounter logical inconsistencies even facing general questions in the human world, e.g. hallucinations, even in simple Boolean logic [1]. When transferring to the Pokemon world, this issue is even amplified because:\n\n* The vast majority of pokemon data on the web is like wikipedia, describing the basic attributes of each Pokemon, **while the available data that relates reasoning is very minimal.**\n\n* **Most high-quality data is on videos**, which is hard to collect. We notice that there are methods that allow the model to learn from videos, which is an interesting future work for us.\n\n**W1&Q2** how our method generalizes to other new worlds\n\nThank you for the question. We admit that in the paper we only discussed the outworld of the Pokemon world and do not verify our findings in other new world settings. These are highly interesting to discover, and we will leave these new things for future work, thank you.\n\n**W3** discussion of the real-world applications beyond game scenarios\n\nIt will be fascinating to customize an LLM for different outworlds, to create a sense of unprecedented immersion. This is applicable for the movie industry, theme parks, beyond games. The ultimate application may be the metaverse, which can be connected to each of our daily life.\n\n**Q3** does self-competition lead to any unexpected behaviors\n\nThank you for your question. We have not found any unexpected outcomes of the model after self-training.\n\n[1] Hongqiu Wu, et al. Empower Nested Boolean Logic via Self-Supervised Curriculum Learning"

The paper also analyzes the awareness and reasoning of outworld knowledge in LLMs, highlighting severe distortions and contradictions. A self-supervised learning method based on self-competition is proposed, where the LLM improves itself by playing Pokemon battles against itself. The paper concludes by evaluating the outworld adaptation of the LLM on two downstream tasks, demonstrating significant improvement after self-training."

And if this field has been previously researched before, the author should cite it. This can enable readers to more accurately get the problem the author wants to address, rather than having a vague concept.\n2. The method part seems to lack some innovativeness. Similar approaches might have been proposed in prior work, such as AlphaStar. Furthermore, it appears to share some similarities with RLHF or DPO, except that the annotator has transitioned from a human to the environment. However, I don't deny that this method can be helpful for transferring LLM to a new environment.\n3. I think this environment is a good contribution. Researchers can generate some entirely counterintuitive operations by configuring the environment's basic settings, such as making fire counteract water (which is not Pokemon but a completely unfamiliar environment that needs exploration). Therefore, I hope the author can provide a more detailed description of the extensions that this environment can offer and how they may be applied in research scenarios."

Could the author discuss this issue?"

                        "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**W1** definition of outworld knowledge\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We have defined \u201coutworld knowledge\u201d in the second paragraph of Section 1.\nWe notice that there may be a lack of discussion of the relevance of our defined outworld knowledge to previous studies. We will work on this point carefully in the new version. Thank you.\n\n**However, in the context of emerging LLMs, we are the first to discuss the model adaption to new world settings, to the best of our knowledge.**\n\n**W2** lack of innovativeness of the method\n\nFirst, we notice that our method is simple yet effective, and there are similar variants proposed in previous papers, but for different purposes, as suggested by Reviewer 5UvA.\n\n**However, from a high-level perspective, the concept of environment feedback we present in the paper is more general than human feedback,** which is embodied in the human environment. This bridges the gap to transfer the model to other new worlds.\n\nAnother merit is that **our method does not necessitate a reward model** since the environment can be used all the time.\n\n**W3** detailed description of the extensions of Pokemon-Py\n\nThank you for your advice. **Based on our implementation, it is easy to extend it to present diverse environments in the pokemon world.** For example, to change the type effectiveness, one simply needs to modify a number in the type configuration file. We will detail how Pokemon-Py can be applied in the appendix. Thank you.\n\n**Q1** baseline against humans\n\nYes, we agree that playing against humans is a stronger baseline than MaxDamage. However, please allow us to clarify that **the goal of self-training is to learn a better initialization to adapt to a new world**, which means to perform better on new world downstream tasks.\n\nContrarily, to compete with an experienced human player (e.g. some tricks to confuse the opponent), this outworld knowledge is far from enough. **We argue that the performance against MaxDamage player is a more intuitive reflection of outworld knowledge acquisition.**\n\nHence, we respectfully argue that including human players is not a mandatory reference to prove the effectiveness of our method. Sure, we are willing to report it in our new version, thank you.\n\n**Q2** whether our paper focuses on achieving a higher winning rate or insight on transferability\n\nYes, we agree with your opinion. As we clarify above, **forging a sophisticated LLM agent to compete against humans is neither the centric nor contribution of our paper.** From our empirical experience, LLMs even GPT4 cannot achieve human-like performances in playing games, though there is a chance if training a policy on them.\n\nIn our paper, we first unveil the powerlessness of LLMs on outworld knowledge. We then propose to utilize the nature of competition to generate strong data to transfer the model. The performance against MaxDamage player and on two downstream tasks demonstrate the better adaption of the trained model."

                        "value": "Thanks for your rebuttal.\n\n**W1**: I know the novelty of the \"outworld\" setting but I want to see a **formal** definition if possible since paragraph 2 in the introduction is somewhat ambiguous. I think something like this would be good: \"The distribution here represents the in-world knowledge which means that LLMs have been pre-trained on it. Here is the human preference distribution and SFT and RLHF try to align LLMs with this distribution. And here is the out-world knowledge which represents the knowledge in the new world, and this is exactly the problem that we want to estimate and solve.\"\n\n**Q1**: Yes I agree that your contribution is not focused on beating humans. But I think a human baseline can make this paper more complete especially for a novel problem (outworld knowledge) because it shows how far the methods are from human-level intelligence.\n\nI have no problems with the other parts. Overall I keep my score and vote for acceptance."

'outworld knowledge awareness' : a baseline evaluation of the pokemon-related outworld knowledge present in ChatGPT, LLaMA2-7b and Alpaca-7b, in terms of factual and reasoning-requiring Q&As, showing poor result on the reasoning-required Q&As and therefore goading us to the conclusion that the outworld laws of the pokemon world are confusing state-of-the-art LLMs.\nNote that the reasoning-required questions are based on accurate move selection for a pokemon in battle with an opponent.\n\n2. POKEMON-Py : a python library enabling using POKEMON battles as interactive playground for text-based state-of-the-art AI systems: text-based observations and instructions are provided to simulate a two-players pokemon trainer battle.\n\n3. Self-Training with Self-Competition : a novel self-supervised learning method to adapt pre-trained LLMs to new world settings, thus enabling growth.\n\nRegarding evaluation of the outworld adaptation, the paper proposes to instrumentalise two downstream tasks performance as a measure of outworld adaptation.\n\nExperimental evidences shows that LLaMA2-7b can be effectively adapted to the POKEMON world."

                    "value": "## Novelty:\n\nAs far as I know, outworld adaptation/generalization is a novel problem and the papers proposes a new environment in POKEMON-PY. \n\nWhile the proposed self-supervised learning method to address this new outworld adaption problem is new, in the context of LLMs and outworld adaptation, it is actually very similar to Supervised Self-Play (S2P) in its 'scheduled' variant from [1], which was proposed in the context of Emergent Communication ; which can be indeed thought of as an outworld adaptation where the outworld is the natural language and the pre-trained world is that of the emergent language.\n\nIn more details, scheduled S2P is stage-wise identical to the algorithm proposed here.\nWhere a difference can be seen is in 2 points:\n\n1. firstly, the dataset that is used during the supervised learning stage is static in scheduled S2P because there is no RL-like environment to sample new data from. \n2. secondly, the self-play task is cooperative in scheduled S2P, it is a referential game, while the proposed algorithm here is using a competitive task. \n\nI find that those two discrepancies bring enough incremental innovation to make the paper worthy of publication provided that a proper discussion about the similarities and differences with scheduled S2P is included to the manuscript.\n\n\n[1] : Lowe, Ryan, et al. \"On the interaction between supervision and self-play in emergent communication.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.\n\n## Quality:\n\n### Unsupported Claim:\nIn Section 4.1, the following claim is made without evidence:\n`The choice of \u03b5 affects the convergence rate of the algorithm, and a larger one will make it slower.'\nPlease provide citation of a similar phenomenon in previous literature or supporting evidence such as a table or a graph showing, respectively, either the final performance or the learning curves of different runs within the different hyperparameter settings of $\\epsilon$.\n\n### Statistical Significance:\n\nWhile Table 3 and 5 show very interesting progressions, I think that the experiments both lack in terms of statistical significance:\n\n1. It seems that only one random seeded run has been performed, since there is no mention of how many random seeds have been run. I would expect at least 3 differently-seeded runs to be reported on, if possible, please?\n\n2. Then, following usage of multiple randomly-seeded runs, I would expect the reported statistics to be comprised of at least mean (or median) and standard deviation (or variance).\n\nI would expect to see in Section 4.3 the details about the different random seeds, if it is solely an omission.\n\n### Experimental design :\n\nSection 5 highlights boolean Q&A and Language Inference as the two downstream task to evaluate outworld adaptation, following the self-supervised learning stage.\n\nI am surprise that the experiments in Section 3 are not being repeated following the self-supervised learning stage in order to evaluate the outworld adaptation.\nCould you explain why is that?\n\n\n## Clarity:\n\n### Need for an algorithm?\n\nSection 4.1 details the proposed self-supervised learning method, but I find it difficult to follow.\nI think that the addition of formal notation to refer to each model and the training operations that they go through would help increase the clarity, maybe?\n\nOr, if space permits it, I think it would be helpful to provide an actual algorithm environment to refer to, on top of the information provided in Figure 3, maybe?\n\n\n### Hyperparameter choice:\n\nSection 4.3 highlights batch size and learning rate hyperparameter values but it is unclear how those are used:\nHas there been multiple runs of the experiment with each combination of the hyperparameter values?\n\n### Section 5 Test-Train Split Issue ?\n\nThe boolean Q&A fine-tuning and testing experiment is unclear with regards to the train-test split employed: from my understanding, the positive testing samples are the same as the positive training samples?\nIf so, then this is a critical issue in terms of the validity of the experiment.\n\n## Significance:\n\nIn the current state, both (i) the gap in related work comparison, and (ii) the missing statitics to truely evaluate the significance of the results make the significance of the paper difficult to evaluate.\n\nFor now, I can only vouch for a minimal significance.\nI am hoping to be able to increase my appreciation throughout the rest of the review process and hope to increase my scores accordingly."

                        "value": "Thank you for your careful and insightful review.\n\n**W1** discussion with relevant papers\n\nThank you very much for suggesting a relevant paper. After reading this paper, we agree that there are similarities between our proposed self-training and self-play (S2P). We both have two models to play with each other, while the purposes are different.\nOur focus is self-competition during the process of self-play, **which in our opinion is the most general way to screen out for better data or individuals,** in nature. This also means our method is totally unsupervised.\nInstead, the purpose of S2P is self-cooperation, which largely relies on the supervised data, as discussed in the paper.\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We will carefully discuss the relationships in our new version.\n\n**W2.1** the choice of $\\epsilon$\n\nThank you for your question. The idea of choosing $\\epsilon$ is the same as \\epsilon-greedy. According to our empirical experiments, it is useful. We show the results against Random player before Gen 30 below:\n\n|              | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Gen 3 | Gen 5 | Gen 10 | Gen 20 | Gen 30 |\n|--------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n|$ \\epsilon=0$   | 51.5  | 52.7  | 56.2  | 59.5  | 68.8   | 62.0   | 68.5   |\n|$ \\epsilon=0.2$ | 52.2  | 53.6  | 58.5  | 61.2  | 75.5   | 75.5   | 80.8   |\n| $\\epsilon=0.5$ | 51.9  | 51.4  | 52.3  | 52.1  | 55.9   | 58.8   | 62.6   |\n\nWe see that $\\epsilon$ plays an important role for the eventual performance, while the $\\epsilon=0.5$ case converges much slower, since the randomness is too high. \n\nDue to our multi-aspect experiments in the paper, we cannot discuss every setting in the paper with limited space. We will include these numbers in the appendix. Thank you.\n\n**W2.2** statistical significance\n\nThank you for your reminder. In the paper, to reduce the variance, **we perform each battle play against Random and MaxDamage players with 100 times, which we have mentioned in the paper.**\n\nIn addition, we clarify that **all experiments are ran under 3 random seeds (42, 0, 2023), and we report the average numbers.** Since each result are averaged from 300 battles, **the variance is very low** even in the early generations of self-training.\n\nThe self-training process (for 50 generations) is only performed for once because of the great training cost.\n\nFor the fine-tuning experiments on two downstream tasks, **we ran only for once in the paper,** and this is a drawback. **Hence, we rerun the experiments over 3 seeds** (42, 0, 2023). We report the new results as well as the standard deviation below:\n\n|        | Boolean QA  | Inference   |\n|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n| 0      | 77.4 (1.14) | 46.0 (1.63) |\n| Gen 5  | 80.2 (0.86) | 46.0 (0.00) |\n| Gen 20 | 80.7 (0.90) | 49.7 (1.25) |\n| Gen 30 | 86.0 (1.56) | 55.0 (0.82) |\n| Gen 50 | 86.6 (1.03) | 60.0 (2.90) |\n\nWe will specify this setting in our new version. Thank you.\n\n**W2.3** experimental design\n\n**Yes, the two downstream tasks (Boolean QA and language inference) are exactly derived from the tasks in Section 3.** We only transfer the factual question to True or False, and simplify the reasoning question by limiting it to type effectiveness. **Our purpose is to evaluate the accuracy automatically,** which is more efficient for us to perform more experiments. In the analysis experiments in Section 3, the results are evaluated by hand in most cases.\n\n**W3.1** need a detailed algorithm\n\nThank you for your advice. We will further illustrate an algorithm of our training method to increase its clarity. Thank you.\n\n**W3.2** hyperparameter choice\n\nFor each model, we train it with two learning rates 3e-4 and 8e-4. The selection of the batch size (2 and 4) is purely based on the sentence length for different tasks, to maximize the utilization of chip memories, which do not impact the eventual training performance in our experiments.\n\n**W3.3** train-test split\n\nYes, we reserve the positive samples and resample new negative samples to be test set. **The reason is that the positive cases are more important than negative ones and we need to evaluate whether the model can better memorize them.** This is also the lurking situation of the pre-training of LLMs.\n\n**We thus report the performance on positive and negative cases separately**, as a solution for this. Please see below (under seed 42):\n\n|        | Positive | Negative |\n|--------|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n| 0      | 96.0     | 58.0     |\n| Gen 5  | 96.0     | 64.0     |\n| Gen 20 | 94.4     | 68.0     |\n| Gen 30 | 97.9     | 74.5     |\n| Gen 50 | 98.6     | 75.0     |\n\nWe find that the role of self-training in classifying negative samples is more significant, while does not compromise that on positive samples."

In our paper, **we train LLaMA with the language modeling loss (i.e. next word prediction)** on the collected win data. We show a concrete illustration of our data:\n\n*Instruction:*\n\n*Given a battle context, suggest a move for Roaring Moon.*\n\n*Input:*\n*pokemon: Roaring Moon tera: Steel moves: Dragon Dance, Earthquake, Substitute, Acrobatics opponent: Iron Hands*\n\n*Response:*\n\n*Earthquake*\n\nThe model is trained to predict \u201cEarthquake\u201d conditioned on the previous context.\n\nWe did not highlight this because there are not many options for training decoder-only models like LLaMA, while we will clarify this point in the new version, thank you.\n\n**Our training code is the same as performing supervised fine tuning (SFT) with an autoregressive LM.**\n\nWe hope the concreteness above may address your concern, thank you.\n\n**Q2.1** if the collected data is utilized as-is\n\nYes, **we do not change anything within in the data** except to make it follow the prompt format.\n\n**Q2.2** if the collected data reflects the optimal game strategy\n\nPlease allow us to clarify that **our focus is to adapt the model to outworld knowledge, rather than teaching it the optimal policy to play real games.** These two objectives are not straightforwardly related. Training a good adapter is leaning to providing a nice initialization to the new world.\n\nSure, from Table 3, we see that the trained model on Gen 50 achieves a 72.0% win rate against MaxDamage player, **which suggests that its learned policy is at least strong.**\n\n**Q3** the difficulty of the factual and reasoning tasks\n\nThe factual questions we craft in the paper are very basic, e.g. types of pokemons, functions of items. All this information can be easily fetched from the web. **Hence, we think these questions are all easy for LLMs if they have seen during training.**\n\nThe reasoning-required questions are on the basic selection of moves, most depending on type effectiveness. **They are also easy for humans, even the newbie in playing pokemon.**\n\nHowever, we find that LLMs do not work on these questions, especially the reasoning-required ones.\n\n**Q4** how LLMs perform in real-world\n\nWe are sorry and not sure if we really understand your question.\n\nLLMs have a great grasp of factual questions in the real world, though there are hallucination problems in answering those questions, for example, reported in [1]. On the other hand, they are also capable of some highly complex reasoning problems, e.g. theorem proving, even difficult for humans. However, in our paper, our designed outworld questions of reasoning are very simple for humans, while LLMs show powerless.\n\n[1] Jirui Qi, et al.

                        "value": "Thank you for your valuable review.\n\n**W1&Q1** why choosing the Pokemon world as a case study\n\n**Objectively, Pokemon is well-known enough and has a complete world setting. One can find a complete database from the web to verify our statements in the paper.** In addition, it is a strategy game with clear rule settings, which suits for crafting reasoning samples.\n\nSubjectively, the research is from personal interest.\n\nWe notice that it is the limitation that we cannot totally generalize the pokemon knowledge to other outworld knowledge. It is also an interesting future direction to perform a more thorough evaluation of outworld knowledge in LLMs. However, the contribution of our paper is not solely an evaluation of outworld knowledge. Thank you.\n\n**W2&Q3** compare with reinforcement learning\n\nWe agree that our method only consider the samples from the winner. However, **due to the absence of loser data, our method avoids unnecessary oscillations and can faster get close to a nice initialization point**, which we seek for outworld adaption. Sure, we agree it is promising to design a ranking loss, e.g. in RLHF. We will leave this for future work.\n\n**Q2** what we can infer LLMs in other new worlds\n\nFrom the results in our paper, we highly conjecture that LLMs cannot tackle simple reasoning tasks in new worlds effectively, and suffer from hallucinations that are even more severe than those in the real world."
