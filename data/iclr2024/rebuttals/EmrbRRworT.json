The english is extremely poor, which makes the understanding of the notions introduced simply impossible. I declare myself to be an expert on this topic, but this paper I could not understand at all. As an example, one of the main theorems of the paper, the one claiming that a certain logic coincides with GNNs, is presented without having introduced GNNs before! \n\nI have the feeling that there is something interesting, and even deep, in this paper, but the authors need to work extensively on the presentation for this to become clear. As such, it is not at the level of what I'd consider \"reviewable\" for NeurIPS."

                    "value": "The paper proposes an enhanced framework for studying message passing neural networks, and an enhanced graded modal logic to recreate results of Barcel\u00f3 et al 2020. \nI found the paper quite difficult to read, most of it due to shortcomings of the authors in making the definitions clear; see for example the definition of k-hop (l_1,...,) neighbourhood. But if I understood correctly, the proposal is to create masks of the local structure of each node, but where masks are given in terms of adding, or removing, certain nodes from the graph. If so, then the paper has two main weak points. First, resulting GNNs are not permutation-invariant (unless one permutes everything in the GNNs accordingly, but this is not treated in the paper). And second, the paper misses comparation on more recent literature regarding similar techniques."

For example, how do I distinguish from the neighbourhood of a node when I mask just the node v_1, and the neighbourhood when I mask just the node v_2?"

In particular, instead of the simple edge modality, exponentially many modalities are considered, each of them encoding directed path (non)-existences between nodes. It is shown that logical classifiers expressible by an extended notion of GNNs correspond precisely to those expressible in the extended modal logic, hereby generalising the result by Barcel\u00f3 et al. A consequence is that the extended modalities and GNNs have higher expressive power."
