We have omitted these details because of limited space in the paper. We have now detailed this in the new version of our paper. For the testing of the baseline MC-Dropout, we perform multiple ( k = 10 ) forward inference passes with the same dropout rate applied and subsequently average the outputs from all the forward runs. \n\n## Significance of the results\n> The performance is not convincing enough. The improvement is not significant, and according to the ablation study, it also seems very sensitive to the hyperparameters.\nOur paper highlights the potential of the stochastic attention method as compared to other well-established uncertainty estimation methods, namely Deep Ensembles and MC-Dropout. As far as we understand, there are no other uncertainty estimation methods applicable to transformer-based SSL and our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles method. The main intent of our paper is to highlight the potential of the stochastic distributional attention mechanism for uncertainty estimation in applications where labels are not readily available. Regarding the sensitivity to hyperparameters, this is a common trait in advanced models in our domain, including the baselines. Despite this, our method outperforms well-established baselines across various settings, indicating robustness. \n\n##\n> It's not proper for the paper to say 'We propose a stochastic transformer architecture with distributional embedding......', since the distributional embeddings and Wasserstein distance-based attention mechanism are the same as Fan et al., 2022.\n\nThank you for highlighting this statement. This statement should be rephrased as \n> \u201cWe propose an alternative stochastic transformer architecture with distributional embedding for masking based vision SSL\u201d\n\nas we did not intend to claim the architecture and embedding but rather its application for uncertainty quantification in SSL domain. We would again like to point out that the modifications we performed to accommodate the higher embedding dimension of image data in vision transformers and the stochastic regularization property of the distributional embedding in contrast to the implementation done by Fan et al (2022).\n\n## Question regarding dropout rate\n>Why set dropout ratio as 0.3 for the MC-Dropout baseline? Isn't it slightly higher than the common options?\n\nWe chose a dropout rate of 0.3 taking into account the dropout rates used in our reference papers. Pei et al. (2021) ([1]) used dropout rates of 0.5/0.1 for their hierarchical stochastic transformer uncertainty estimation. Miani et al. (2022) ([2]) used a dropout rate of 0.2 for their unsupervised representation learning uncertainty estimation method.\n\n[1] Pei, J., Wang, C., & Szarvas, G. (2021).

The results will be much more conclusive if the author reports results on larger-scale datasets, e.g., imagenet, or at least datasets with larger images (e.g., mini-imagenet, or tiny-imagenet).\n\nWe performed further experiments on tiny-ImageNet.

Additionally, the method is more than twice as costly in terms of time when compared to the baseline (~4hrs vs ~9hrs). Compounding the issue, I couldn't determine if the results are reported as an average over K runs.\n\nWe would like to stress that we pose the method as a novel alternative to the classic uncertainty estimation methods. While the method may be costly compared to the baseline method, our method outperformed the ensemble method, which is considered the state-of-the-art for uncertainty estimation. The computational requirements for the ensemble method are likewise 10 times costlier than our baseline method. Our method highlights a possible alternative to the commonly used state-of-the-art method that fully leverages the masking-based self-supervised learning procedure. The results are taken as an average over k = 5 runs. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n## Question regarding negative examples in the pre-training contrastive regularization term\nThe main idea of Equation 10 was to leverage the masking procedures used in masking-based SSL frameworks such as data2vec which we use as baselines. While negative pairs may make for a more robust contrastive stochastic regularization, we opted not to sample negative pairs in the exact manner as in SimCLR to not further increase the computational overhead, which in our case is dominated by the distributional computations. The performance delivered from our method can be regarded as a lower bound performance which can potentially be optimized with a more computationally heavy negative pair sampling. Nevertheless, the inclusion and number of negative samples used in contrastive learning is also a big area of research, especially when used together with augmentations. Ash et al (2021) ([1]) pointed out that , \n>\u201cvision experiments are murkier with performance sometimes even being insensitive to the number of negatives\u201d\n\n>\u201cthese experiments point to a distortion between the theoretical framework typically used to study NCE (using true positives) and, in the vision case, what is observed in practice. The core of this distortion appears to involve the use of augmentation techniques that have been highly tuned for object recognition/computer vision tasks.\u201d\n\n[1] Ash, J.

However, the results still appear somewhat limited. Respectfully, the response regarding 'negative samples' did not fully address my concerns. I suggest an ablation study on the use of negative samples to strengthen the paper and make it more attractive to readers.\n\nI appreciate the core idea of the paper regarding stochastic token embedding, and I believe the paper has merit. However, it seems somewhat hurried, particularly in the numerical section, which could benefit from further refinement. Therefore, I maintain my original evaluation."
