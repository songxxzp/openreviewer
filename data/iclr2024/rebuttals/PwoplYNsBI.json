The main take-away is that for any portion ratio $\\eta\\in(0,1)$, there always exists some $\\epsilon$-stationary point in the final $\\eta T$ iterates with sufficiently large iteration count $T$. Additionally, it is claimed that the density of $\\epsilon$-stationary points in the last $\\eta T$ iterates approaches one as $T$ goes infinity. Numerical results on nonconvex regularized logistic regression and CNN training tasks are reported to confirm the theoretical predictions."

                    "value": "While the addressed problem is important, the main results obtained in this work are unfortunately not satisfactory both in significance/novelty and correctness. \n\n- W1: Significance of contribution. IMO, one major limitation of the main result in Theorem 3 lies in that the required iteration count $T$ to guarantee the existence of stationary solution in the last $\\eta$ portion should scale as $T\u2019/\\eta^2$ where $T\u2019$ is the well-known complexity implied by Theorem 1. This makes the result in Theorem 3 much less interesting as the portion size $\\eta T$ could be even larger than $T\u2019$, and thus can hard to convincingly demystify the appealing performance of SGD in the tail iteration phase. \n\n- W2: Novelty of analysis. The convergence analysis developed in the current work builds largely upon the existing techniques for nonconvex SGD (e.g., Khaled & Richtarik 2022), with some slight modifications adopted mostly by ignoring the first $(1-\\eta)T$ terms in the sum of gradient norms at the iterates. It turns out that such a na\u00efve treatment only leads to fairly weak guarantees as pointed out in the previous comment. \n\n- W3: Soundness of claim. Regarding the results about the density of stationary points, I cannot agree that the bound in Theorem 5 guarantees the entire tail iterates would be stationary when $T$ becomes large enough. The rationale is that the constant step-size is typically chosen as $\\gamma=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}$ such that $\\log(1+L\\gamma^2A)$ roughly scales as $L\\gamma^2A=\\frac{LA}{T}$ which cancels the factor $T$ in the denominator. Concerning Theorem 6, the RHS of the bound looks confusing to me mainly because the role of $\\epsilon$ is completely missing in the bound. More specifically, it looks like a factor $1/\\epsilon$ is missing in the definition of the quantity $D$ above Theorem 6. Please correct me if anything misunderstood here. Otherwise, the current results in Theorem 5 and Theorem 6 cannot at all support the claim that the final iterates of SGD should be densely concentrated around the $\\epsilon$-stationary points.\n\n- W4: Presentation clarity. The readability of this paper can be enhanced by properly highlighting and reorganizing the materials in Section 4. There are all together six theorems stated in Section 4. However, some of these theorems are either restated from literature (Theorem 1), or intermediate results (Theorem 2), or for different choices of learning rates (Theorems 3 - 6). It is suggested to only highlight those relatively most fundamental results as theorems while leave the rest as lemmas or corollaries. Concerning the exposition of experimental results, it is odd to show Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the front sections without any introduction, but quite later get the figures explained in Section 5."

This means that the important classical setting of bounded variance ($A = 0$, $B = 1$, $C = \\sigma^2$) cannot be recovered by the theory in this work. \n\n2. The statement at the end of page 1 is wrong. It is well-known and immediate to show the last iterate convergence of SGD under Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz or even weaker assumptions, see, e.g., Section 5 in [1] or Corollary 1 in [2]. \n\n3. The main result of the paper (Theorems 2, 3) seems to be trivial to obtain by simply applying the standard analysis of SGD to the last $\\eta T$ iterates for any $\\eta \\in (0,1)$. Yes, the authors expectedly obtain the optimal convergence rate in $\\epsilon$. However, the constant hides the dependence on $\\eta$. E.g., taking $\\eta = 1/T$ would mean that the last iterate does not even have to converge. \n\n4. The presentation of the myths/legends in the paper seem highly subjective and sometimes confusing. Some of them were already addressed in the literature or believed to be well-known results. \n- For instance, Legend I does not seem to be challenged in this paper since no better convergence is established (see point 3.). \n- Myth II is not really a myth. It is well known that all what matters for convergence of SGD is the order of the sum of stepsizes and of the sum of its squares. It has been observed in many prior work already. \n- Myth III about better assumptions of the noise model is confusing. I do not see how this assumption is challenged/demystified in this work. In fact, even the last iterate convergence of GD (SGD without noise) is not established in this work. \n\n\n[1] X. Fontaine, V. De Bortoli, A. Durmus.

Basically, it is based on the argument that: if we only consider the last $\\eta T$ iterations, when telescope, we just throw away the first $(1-\\eta T)$ terms as we sum up the gradient norms. In other words, we can consider it as two stages, in the first stage of $(1-\\eta T)$ iterations, the function value will follow some descent lemma up to an extra term in noise (depending on C and $\\gamma_t^2$), i.e., the last term in (3), which is summable; the second stage of last $\\eta T$ iterations, it just follow the normal analysis for SGD. Such an argument in Theorem 2, 3, and 4 is not very meaningful because: \n\na. The results contain $\\eta T$ on the right-hand side of (6).

[3] shows that for any fixed iterate (e.g., last iterate or k-th iterate) of T iterations of SGD, we can not provide a guarantee for the gradient. These two results do not contradict each other, because [1, 2] are for the asymptotic convergence for a fixed nonconvex problem, while [3] says we cannot provide a non-asymptotic rate for the last-iterate for the class of L-smooth function.

Instead, it is still an averaged or minimal gradient norm complexity result, but with respect to the last $\\eta T$ iterations for some **constant $\\eta$**. \n\nWe can take Theorem 3 as an example. The proof is to apply the traditional SGD analysis to the last $\\eta T$ iterations, meaning that the result is trivial. Let us **fix the total number of iterations to be $\\eta T$ rather than $T$**. Through a set of quite standard analyses of nonconvex SGD, we have $\\min_{0\\leq t \\eta T} \\mathbb{E}\\|\\nabla f(x_t\\|^2\\leq \\varepsilon$, if $\\eta T \\geq \\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon^2)$."
