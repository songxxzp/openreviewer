                    "value": "The authors study the effects of pretraining loss, supervised training data amount, and augmented data amount on reasoning performance of tuned large language models. They claim that pretraining loss is negatively linear correlated to the fintuned and in-context learning performance and serves as a more effective performance metric compared to the size of the pretrained model or the amount of pretraining tokens. \n\nA Log-linear trend is reported between training data size and model performance. \nThe authors also propose to augment the training data using rejection sampling. Essentially, generating multiple answers for each query in the training data and augmenting the dataset using those pairs in which the final answer is correct according to the ground truth. Augmenting the data through rejection sampling from multiple model sizes further improves the reasoning performance of smaller models."

Wouldn\u2019t it make more sense if the x-axis was the loss of the finetuned models? \n\nThe primary concern I have with the study is that the authors do not study different pretraining losses of the same model (identical size and training tokens). Their assertion is that as the pretraining loss decreases, the tuned and ICL performance improve linearly within a certain range. However, it\u2019s important to note that this improvement is not based on the models of the same size or same amount of pretrianing data."

It would be nice to include it somewhere either in the table or its description.\n\nThe claim \u201cas the pretraining loss decreases, the SFT and ICL performance improve linearly within a certain range\u201d appears somewhat unclear and could benefit from additional explanation.\n\nPlease refer to the question and concern in the weakness section as well."

We have uploaded a new version with new experiments. We use a random sample of the Pile test corpus to align the pre-train losses of LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Pythia series. We conduct SFT and RFT experiments on GSM8K benchmark with Pythia series. We conduct SFT experiments on MATH benchmark with LLaMA and LLaMA2. Our detailed results are listed in the updated PDF of section H in appendix. I will summary our main findings here.\n\n(a) The pre-training losses are still negatively linear correlated to SFT performance including Pythia series models. (b) RFT improves performances of Pythia series models significantly. (Pythia-410M SFT 5.6 vs RFT 18.9, Pythia-2.8B SFT 18.8 vs RFT 34.6). (c) For MATH benchmark, LLaMA series models still improving performance linearly when double fine-tuning data.\n\nW1: We have calculated the pre-train losses of LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Pythia using the same pretraining dataset - The Pile test set and shown in Appendix H. We find that all our findings still hold.\n\nW2: The fine-tuning losses strongly related to the epoch amount. After the 1st epoch, every sample have been optimized by the model and the fine-tuning losses could be somehow arbitrary to the model performances. Furthermore, the fine-tuning loss (on the test set) is a metric of model performance while the pre-training loss is a performance indicator.\n\nW3: In Appendix H, we conduct the experiment with Pythia-v2. All models from Pythia-v2 series use the same pre-training data and the same amount of optimization steps. We find that Pythia-v2 with RFT still improves performances on GSM8K significantly.\n\nQ1: If all generated samples have the same equation set across model sizes, we will preserve the first one.\n\nQ2: K=100. We will add it to the paper.\n\nQ3: SFT performance and ICL performance is negatively linearly correlated to pre-training losses within some range of pre-training losses. But this cannot hold for all pre-training losses, since pre-training losses is unbounded (0, +\\inf), while the model performance is bounded (0, 1). We will rephrase it."

They find that across many models the model's pretraining loss is highly correlated with its performance on gsm8k. They also find that as pretraining loss improves, the benefits from supervised finetuning (SFT) diminish, and models with lower pretraining loss require more finetuning data to surpass the model's in-context-learning performance. Next they study how rejection sampling finetuning (RFT) improves with model scale. The idea is to sample a bunch of outputs from the model and then finetune on the correct samples. They also filter correct outputs that have similar reasoning paths. They find that RFT generally outperforms SFT up to 13B parameters, and benefits less at 33B parameters. Increasing the number of samples for RFT generally improves performance, but less than increasing the size of the finetuning dataset. Lastly they study combining RFT datasets from multiple models, finding that it improves over RFT from a single model up to 13B parameters. Overall by combining RFT data from multiple models they are able to obtain 7B and 13B LMs that are competitive with models that have many more parameters."

It would improve my confidence in their results if they also included other tasks, such as MATH.\n* Their RFT method is nearly a special case of STAR [cite], with the only difference being that they also filter reasoning paths for diversity.

We do not conduct RFT (k=100) for models larger than 33B and the reason is two-fold. The first reason is sampling 100 times with 65B/70B models is not cheap (10^19 FLOPs) and the second reason is we have shown that LLaMA-33B SFT models have shown a strong ability for over-fitting (or memorizing) GSM8K problems. LLaMA-33B SFT produces much less different reasoning paths compared to LLaMA-7/13B which is not suitable for RFT."

                    "value": "The paper analyzes the scaling relationship between the math reasoning performance of a supervised fine-tuned LM and pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount. The authors find the pre-training loss is negatively linearly related to the performance while the supervised data amount is log linearly related to the performance. The augmented data amount has a weaker effect than the supervised data amount. All these effects diminish when the LM size increases. The authors also propose a rejection sampling fine-tuning \n(RFT) technique, which uses LMs to augment multiple reasoning chains for one training example, to improve the math reasoning performance of an LM. All experiments are performed on the GSM8K dataset."

We already know the importance of model size, pre-training loss, and data amount. Since we are not going to design and pre-train a new LM at fine-tuning time, which requires predicting larger LM's performance from smaller ones, I'm not sure why a fine-tuning scaling law would be useful. It just suggests people use the strongest existing pre-training LM, which is exactly what people are doing right now. Maybe the authors can convince me of this during the rebuttal.\n2. The proposed RFT feels disconnected from the scaling law experiments. i.e. It does not seem to need to be inspired by the discovered scaling law. RFT basically suggests augmenting the fine-tuning data with LM-generated reasoning paths and rejecting the ones ending with wrong answers. I don't think the idea of data augmentation needs to be inspired by scaling law.\n3. Another concern about this paper is that all experiments are limited to one small dataset, GSM8K, which only has 7K+ training examples. Given the scale of the experiments, I can understand this experimental choice. However, I'm still wondering if all the conclusions (e.g. linear with pre-training loss, log-linear with supervised data size) still hold on other math world datasets."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful comment.\n\nGeneral response: Many reviewers are interested in performance for different LLM and different datasets and question our conclusion because of the pre-training losses come from different corpora. We have uploaded a new version with new experiments. We use a random sample of the Pile test corpus to align the pre-train losses of LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Pythia series. We conduct SFT and RFT experiments on GSM8K benchmark with Pythia series. We conduct SFT experiments on MATH benchmark with LLaMA and LLaMA2. Our detailed results are listed in the updated PDF of section H in appendix. I will summary our main findings here.\n\n(a) The pre-training losses are still negatively linear correlated to SFT performance including Pythia series models. (b) RFT improves performances of Pythia series models significantly. (Pythia-410M SFT 5.6 vs RFT 18.9, Pythia-2.8B SFT 18.8 vs RFT 34.6). (c) For MATH benchmark, LLaMA series models still improving performance linearly when double fine-tuning data.\n\nW1: To improve a specific ability for LLMs, we have three directions including (1) improve base model via pre-training (2) obtain more human-written fine-tuning data (3) augment more model-generated fine-tuning data. The fine-tuning scaling law (Section 3.2, (2)) and augmented fine-tuning scaling law (Section 3.3, (3)) can help LLM practitioners to decide to generate which kind of data (human-written fine-tuning data or model-generated data). When the amount of SFT data for a task (i.e. gsm8k) is not too much, one can decide to generate human-written data first. When the amount of SFT data is very large or fine-tuning scaling law is similar to augmented scaling law, one should decide to generate data from LLM augmentation.\n\nW2: RFT tries to investigate the augmented data fine-tuning scaling law. Our motivation is not to propose a new algorithm for data augmentation but to understand the augmentation data scaling law. The key finding of RFT is augmented fine-tuning performance in math reasoning is based on different reasoning path amount instead of augmented data amount.\n\nW3: Please see general response."

The paper demonstrates that SFT performance has a log-linear relationship with the amount of supervised data, while RFT performance benefits from the increase of distinct reasoning paths.

We have uploaded a new version with new experiments. We use a random sample of the Pile test corpus to align the pre-train losses of LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Pythia series. We conduct SFT and RFT experiments on GSM8K benchmark with Pythia series. We conduct SFT experiments on MATH benchmark with LLaMA and LLaMA2. Our detailed results are listed in the updated PDF of section H in appendix. I will summary our main findings here.\n\n(a) The pre-training losses are still negatively linear correlated to SFT performance including Pythia series models.\n(b) RFT improves performances of Pythia series models significantly. (Pythia-410M SFT 5.6 vs RFT 18.9, Pythia-2.8B SFT 18.8 vs RFT 34.6).\n(c) For MATH benchmark, LLaMA series models still improving performance linearly when double fine-tuning data.\n\nW1 & Q3: We have added Pythia on GSM8K and LLaMA on MATH experiments.\n\nW2: In Appendix D, we have covered the RFT inference and training FLOPs, which have a significantly lower computational requirement (1 \\times 10^{-4}) compared to pre-training. This level of computational cost is considered acceptable. Although some may argue that using GPT4 API for data augmentation is less expensive, this neglects the computational cost associated with inferencing using GPT4. Additionally, our approach solely relies on models like LLaMA that we aim to enhance, without the need for GPT4. In contrast, other math SFT papers like WizardMATH, Meta-Math, and Mammoth require GPT API for data augmentation.\n\nW3: We are also interested in investigating the relationship between reasoning performance with human-written fine-tuning data amount and model-augmented fine-tuning data amount which is not be researched previously. We also find the distinct reasoning paths are the most important factor for augmentation dates.\n\nQ1: We have conducted experiments on human alignment experiment. We fine-tune LLaMA-7/13/33B models on ShareGPT dataset with (1, 1/4, 1/16, 1/64) amount of data and use MT-Bench to measure the alignment performance. For LLaMA-7B models, we get MT-Bench score with 5.88, 5.85, 5.61, 5.11. For LLaMA-13B models, we get MT-Bench score with 6.13, 6.03, 5.66, 5.24. For LLaMA-33B models, we get MT-Bench score with 6.63, 6.66, 6.17, 5.99. We find that model performances improves with data mount increases in the most scenarios.\n\nQ2: We find that when the pre-trained models get larger (like LLaMA-65B (+0.4) or LLaMA2-70B (+1.6)), the RFT improvement is insignificant. We consider the main reason is larger models have gained considerable reasoning ability during pre-training, and the space for improvement gets smaller for them."
