The paper further argues that this upper bound on VC dimension is almost tight for a ReLU network, since it reaches a VC dimension of $O(L^2 nr \\log(n). $ \nBy plugging their result into the classic VC dimension, generalization error bound by Vapnik, they arrive at a generalization bound for the bounded rank fully connected networks."

While a direct test of this result may not be very feasible, it is a pity that there is no empirical evidence is presented to see if this bound is valid."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Main critique: My big issue with the paper is that the ideas are not presented well, and the technical/notation issues impede the understanding of the reader. While reading the paper I had to frequently go back and forth to try and find the definition of a variable. In other places, there were some parts were very simple concepts (like how activations and fully connected layers are defined), have are explained in an unnecessarily complicated and twisted ways. I've tried to aid the authors with  improving these presentation issues in my detailed issues/questions list. \n\nMain technical/issues questions:\n- \"Due to the rank constraint for the weight matrices, $f (x_j ; a)$ are not necessarily polynomials, instead they could be rational fractions.\" This sentence is not elaborated on, and on to the best of my understanding, is not correct. a low-rank matrix $W$ can be written as $W = AB$, and any polynomial activation $\\psi$ applied on the matrix $\\psi(W x),$ where $x$ denotes the previous layer, is a polynomial in the space of the inputs. Please correct me if I'm wrong in making these hand wavy conclusions. \n- Remark 3: what happened to the rest of the bound, namely $L^2 n r \\log(n)$? Please correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I can see, even if we ignore the $-\\log\\delta$-term, the first part is suggesting the generalization error is bounded by $C \\sqrt{L^2 n r \\log(n)\\log m / m}$ while the remark 3 is suggesting only $C \\sqrt{d}\\sqrt{\\log m/ m}$  holds with high probability, which is substantially smaller. \n- Remark 3: Formally speaking, if $\\delta$ converges to $0$ then the failure probability term will converge to infinity $-\\log(\\delta)\\to \\infty$. Taken from wikipedia, with high probability means \"an event ... whose probability depends on a certain number n and goes to 1 as n goes to infinity,\" I am guessing that what authors want to say is that for some arbitrarily small of $\\delta,$, then we can adjust the value $C$ such that the bound will hold with a probability that will go to zero with increasing $m$. For example if we set $\\delta = m^ {-L^2 n r\\log(n)}$, then the bound for $\\sqrt{2}C$ will hold with $1-\\delta$ probability, which will converge to $0$ as $m$ increases.  Again, please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nDetailed issues/questions: \n- p2 , end of page, let $x_1, \\dots, x_n\\in \\mathcal{F}$ this seems to be a typo, shouldn't they belong to $X$ instead?  \n- page 3 mentions $w = (w_1,\\dots, w_W)\\in R^W$ and bias $b = (b_1,\\dots, b_U)\\in R^U. $ from what I see, I don't see the definition of $W$ and $U$ anywhere in the text. Also, the definition of weights seems to be a matrix, while here it looks like a vector of dimension $W$. I think it's better to clarify this notation a bit and use a simpler, more standard notation\n- page 3, while strictly speaking this is not a problem, the variable z as the pre-activation variable, $\\Psi_{i+1}(z) = (\\psi(z_1),\\dots, \\psi(z_{k_{i}+1})$ is a confusing at first read. Define $z$ as pre-activation first? \n- page 5, Thm2: \"Let wi be the number of network parameters from layer 1 to layer i.\" I find this sentence quite confusing and hard to understand. what do you mean here? \n- page 8 Thm5: there seems to be a conflict of variable $d$ which was previously defined as maximum degree of the polynomial, but here it is used as the bound on the VC dimension. This is particularly troublesome because the first two equations in Thm5 invoke the Thm2 result which does have a \"d\", and use it in Thm4 which also has d but with a different meaning. Perhaps a change of name of variables?"

                    "value": "- I wonder what is the main motivation for this theoretical case study? What is the surprising conclusion of this result which we can draw and apply on some problem? From what I can see this is somewhat missing from the current manuscript. While this is not a direct criticism, including such an explanation will go a long way to persuade and engage the future readers. \n- If I understand correctly the result on VC dimension of fully connected network has been addressed previously, and the main result here is about the case where fully connected layers are low-rank. Without delving into too much technical depth, the fact that the degrees of freedom in a rank-limited fully connected weight matrix will reduce from $n^2$ to $n r$ seems like a borderline obvious thing. Please convince me otherwise, that this is not a simple result?"
