We hope we can bring some clarity with the answers below:\n\n> Lack of comparative methods. Many strategies for deep concept removal have already been proposed[1], such as adversarial concept removal mentioned by the authors. However, they did not compare their method with these classic approaches during the experimental phase.\n\nWe want to emphasize that existing concept removal methods are all (to the best of our knowledge) post-hoc. For post-hoc methods, there is an issue stemming from the entanglement of the features in the last layer of representation, and removing the concept unavoidably removes correlated fatures. In fact, [1] theoretically proves that. We also note that existing methods are only designed to sensor the information, rather generalizing to non-concept instances. Our method is in-processing (and yes, more expensive), but it addresses a more difficult problem. For the sake of it, we implemented LEACE on Striped MNIST, results shown below. We use model M7 trained for 100 epochs with ERM, then apply LEACE, then train a logistic regression classifier.\n\n|                  | EMNIST concept dataset |                   | MNIST concept dataset |                   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n|                          | acc test               | acc train         | acc test               | acc train         |\n| LEACE                     | 0.59(0.01)             | 1 (0)             | 0.59(0.01)             | 1 (0)             |\n\n[1] Abhinav Kumar, Chenhao Tan, Amit Sharma. Probing Classifiers are Unreliable for Concept Removal and Detection\n\n> From the objective function of the method, it can be applicable to different downstream tasks. However, the paper only validated it on classification tasks. Is this method equally applicable to object detection or image generation tasks?\n\nUnfortunatelly, we do not have convincing experiments at the moment. We have tried applying the method to VAE, but there is no quantitative way to verify the results. Furthermore, it is not that trivial how to apply the method to the generative tasks. For instance, in the VAE case, the encoder itself can potentially add the concept back, even if the encoder successfully removed it. For instance, if we train on data that has some dependencies between the concept, it can use that information to infer whether the concept was in the input or not. In other words, both the decoder and encoder suffer from detrimental correlations, while our method is only suitable for removing concept from encoder.\n\n> The performance of the method presented in the paper is also lacking. Table 2 shows a comparison between the authors' method and others, but it seems their method is not optimal, performing worse in some cases than methods without concept annotation.\n\nWe want to bring some clarity why we do the experiments in Table 2. Unlike in the controlled MNIST experiment, while concept removal assessment is not possible in dataset like Celeb-A.  The DRO problem hence can serve as a verification of concept removal. The other baselines in Table 2 address the problem of DRO directly. They are not concerned with concept removal."

The first set of experiments shows that this method can effectively remove a concept from synthetic MNIST data by (a) applying it to multiple wide layers and (b) using out-of-distribution concept datasets.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for appreciating some parts of our paper and providing critical comments. Below we address these comments:\n\n> The main experiment in S4 only demonstrates RQ1 and RQ2 on MNIST. The MNIST dataset is a good sanity check or starting point, but it is not enough to properly demonstrate the usefulness of this approach. A simple linear model can give 90% accuracy on the MNIST task and it is not representative of modern computer vision tasks. The experiments would be more convincing if the results hold on (a) \u201charder\u201d tasks such as CIFAR-10 or CIFAR-100 and larger models (e.g., ResNet50 and ViTs)\n\nThis is a very good point. Unfortunately, we did not manage to make it work on problems where we are required to overfit. On all our MNIST experiments, in the cases where it works well, the train accuracy is usually smaller than test accuracy. Similarly, for the DRO we typically need to regularize in order to be robust. For both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, we are required to overfit on train set in order to achieve competitive performance on test set.\n\n> The experiments in S4 do not adequately support RQ2 (concept datasets can be OOD). The OOD concept dataset considered (EMNIST) is in fact quite similar to the MNIST dataset. It would be useful to provide a more nuanced understanding of when OOD concept datasets fail to remove concepts for example.\n\nIt is hard to say whether it is OOD enough, but there is not many good alternatives. We also want to emphasize that in this particular example, we require quite limited data. Learning invariant representations, to the best of our knowledge, requires access to the transformation [1, 2]. On the contrary, we only require some observations of the transformation on a relevant but not the same dataset. We also note that linear adversarial classifiers play a crucial role in this. If we use an MLP (equivalent to adversarial domain adaptation [3]), and no implicit gradients, the performance significantly drops. In both cases, whether the concept is based on EMNIST or MNIST. But there is also a bigger discrepancy between the two for the MLP:\n\n|         | EMNIST Concept Dataset |                | MNIST Concept Dataset |                |\n|---------|------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|\n|         | acc test               | acc train      | acc test              | acc train      |\n| MLP (DA)    | 18 (0.04)            | 1 (0)          | 0.44 (0.17)           | 1 (0)          |\n\n[1] Mitrovic et al.

Unsupervised domain adaptation by backpropagation\n\n> The experiments do not compare their results with relevant concept removal baselines such as LEACE (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03819) and kernel-space concept erasure (https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.405/). There is no related work section either, so it\u2019s hard for the readers to contextualize these findings.\n\nIt is known that such method suffer from feature entanglement and therefore cannot generalize between concept and non-concept examples [4]. In our quick implementation of LEACE we found that it does not work better than simple ERM for the StripedMNIST. \n\n[4] Abhinav Kumar, Chenhao Tan, Amit Sharma. Probing Classifiers are Unreliable for Concept Removal and Detection\n\n> The deep concept removal method does not work on the Waterbirds dataset.

The authors do acknowledge this and hypothesize that their method may be more effective at removing high-level features than low-level features. However, this explanation is not convincing at all.

I am not sure if subpopulation robustness is the right task to evaluate concept removal. The images in the concept dataset with and without the concept may differ in many ways other than the presence of the concept, and this may lead to a spurious CAV.\n\nThis is a good question and we do not have a clear answer to it. However, let us give the following simple example. If we use a randomly initialized network, the penultimate layer most likely will contain information about the color, but not about the stripes (which can in fact be filtered out with random network [5]). We believe the same is true for Waterbirds, and often the algorithms for DRO utilize this information, by calling it a short cut feature. In that sense, it is very difficult to steer away the network from encoding that low-level information.\n\n[5] Ulyanov, Vedaldi, Lempitsky. Deep image prior."

We hope we can bring some more clarity with our responses below:\n\n> At a high-level, the paper seems to mainly combine two earlier works (Elazar et al, 2018 and Kim et al, TCAV, 2018)\n\n\nWe do not agree with the characterization that we combine two methods (Elazar et al, 2018 and Kim et al, TCAV, 2018). Elazar et al (2018) and other adjacent work [1, 2] is concerned with post-hoc methods, ones that modify the representation produced by some method through a linear projection. Unfortunately, such methods are known to suffer from feature entangling. There is a paper dedicated to discussing this issue [3].\n\nOur method is in-processing, which means we do backpropagation into the models weights as compared to projection of the output of the penultimate layer in Elazar et al (2018).  We acknowledge that in-processing removal is much more expensive than a projection. However, there is simply no other method in literature that does the same. In the experiment with striped MNIST, we manage to learn invariant representation without access to transformation - concept dataset consist of EMNSIT letters. Furthermore, we believe that the characterization of which layers must be included is an interesting finding. Potentially, it suggests that in DNNs features get entangled thanks to contracting layers, which does conform with previous literature [4] (as we mention in p. 5).\n> Why does the concept accuracy for \u201cyoung\u201d and \u201cglasses\u201d not deteriorate, whereas the concept accuracy for \u201cgender\u201d is reduced?\n\nThis example was handcrafted exactly to demonstrate the ability to remove one specific concept (gender), rather than everything that is correlated with it (glasses, young).\n\n[1] Tolga Bolukbasi, Kai-Wei Chang, James Y.

I believe it cannot. By removing one concept, we can only hope it will induce using other concepts, but there is no control over this.\n\n> OOD Generalization has been claimed, the numbers are only reported for Celeb-A, where the blond males have been called the \u201dunseen domain\u201d.

This seems counterproductive.\n\nThe goal of this Figure is to show that the reconstruction is the same for whether the stripes are present in the input or not. That is, we have learned invariant representation with respect to the presence of stripes. We do not claim that the decoder removes the stripes, but we claim that the encoder removes information of whether stripes are present or not."
