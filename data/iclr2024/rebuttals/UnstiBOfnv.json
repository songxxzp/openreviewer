To do so, the authors take 40 questions, then have GPT-4 generate responses that satisfy different personas (e.g., an advanced English learner versus an intermediate English learner), then modify the responses when GPT-4 does not satisfy the specified criteria. The authors then use an ELO analysis and finds that writing with \u201cseveral factual errors\u201d outperforms \u201ccorrect + short\u201d, while finding that order impacts judge\u2019s decisions, and humans tend to be inconsistent. To evaluate better, the authors introduce MERS, which evaluates responses ion terms of \u201cAccuracy\u201d, \u201chelpfulness\u201d and \u201cLanguage\u201d, and find that the ratings of these subcategories more closely align with the ways the different promptings of GPT-4 can be ranked."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review and constructive feedback on our manuscript. \n\n1. Study scale\n\nThe reviewer highlights concerns regarding the small scale of our study, which involved only 40 questions. However, it is important to note that our analysis extended far beyond the raw number of questions. The evaluation encompassed these questions across eight different models, resulting in **5280 individual comparisons**. The total resource and financial expenditure for this scale of analysis amounted to **thousands of USD.**\n\n**Moreover, our analysis demonstrates a consistent trend in the Elo rankings when sampling from these 40 questions.** This consistency indicates that, despite the seemingly small sample size, the dataset is robust enough to yield reliable insights and trends. Therefore, we believe that the chosen sample size and methodology strike a delicate yet effective balance between comprehensive analysis and practical constraints such as cost and resource allocation.\n\n2. Limited evaluation attributes\n\nOur study focused on three attributes \u2013 accuracy, helpfulness, and response length \u2013 based on their relevance and importance in the context of LLM evaluation. We agree that exploring additional attributes could provide a more comprehensive understanding of LLM capabilities. **This choice was a strategic decision to delve deeper into a few significant aspects rather than superficially covering a broader range.** Future research could incorporate more diverse attributes, such as creativity, engagement, or cultural sensitivity, to enrich the evaluation framework.\n\n3. Reliance on manual editing:\n\n**This step was necessary to ensure that the responses adhered to the study's requirements**, as GPT-4 did not always generate outputs that aligned with the intended error types or language proficiency levels. We would like to highlight that only a few examples required post-editing.\n\n4. Larger study scales or more attributes\n\nRegarding the question about the potential impact of a larger study or different attributes, we believe that expanding the study scale and incorporating varied attributes would likely yield more nuanced insights and possibly reveal additional biases or evaluation trends. However, **the core findings regarding the preference for longer, factually incorrect responses over shorter, accurate ones still hold,** as these reflect deeper biases in human and LLM evaluation processes. A larger-scale study would help in validating these findings and understanding their generalizability."

We will also clearly define the terms, like \u201cgame\u201d and \u201chesitancy\u201d, in the future revisions of our manuscript \n\n2. Elo ratings\n\nElo ratings are a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess. In each game, the winner gains points from the loser. **Elo ratings have been adopted to evaluate Language Learning Models (LLMs) in recent publications (Bai et al., 2022; Dettmers et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023) and a popular LLM leaderboard (https://arena.lmsys.org/).**\n\nIn this work, we utilize crowd-sourced annotators, expert annotators, GPT-4, and Claude-1 as evaluators to perform pairwise comparisons. Each comparison involves one question and two answers provided by two different models, and we ask the evaluators to determine which answer is of better quality. The prompt used for LLM evaluation is presented in Figure 9, and the human annotation guideline is in Figure 10.

                    "value": "The paper is focusing on the important open problem of evaluation in natural language generation. Using a dataset consisting of 40 questions of intentionally flawed machine generated (GPT4) answers, the authors employ both human evaluation (crowd-sourced and expert) and LLM-based evaluation focusing on three aspects of the generated texts: i) language proficiency, ii) factual accuracy, and iii) response length. Their analysis reveals biases in the evaluation process: human hesitancy vs LLMs certainty in determining answer quality, humans do not thoroughly fact-check answers vs LLMs displaying some degree of fact-checking ability, and both human and LLM judges favor longer texts. Moreover, factually incorrect models are preferred over those that generate grammatically incorrect or short responses. Informed by these findings, the authors recommend the evaluation of texts from multiple perspectives as opposed to a single metric only, and propose a rating system that assesses the quality of machine-generated texts accounting for i) language, ii) accuracy, and iii) helpfulness criteria."

                    "value": "Their evaluation setup is limited and includes dataset of only 40 questions. The sample size is small and insufficient for drawing convincing conclusions. The authors also do not discuss the importance of the categories of these questions (\u201cgeneric\u201d, \u201cknowledge\u201d, \u201ccommon sense\u201d, and \u201ccounterfactual\u201d) after leaving out other categories. \n\n\nThe expert evaluation section (2.4) discusses games, but these games are not introduced/presented ahead of this section: \u201cwe sample 200 games out of a total pool of 5280 games, which is statistically sufficient to yield meaningful in- sights into the model\u2019s performance\u201d. \n\n\u201cBy incorporating multiple LLM judges, we can establish a more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the generated answers in our study.\u201d - Generally agree with this statement, however in the experiments only GPT-4 and Claude (Antrophic) are used, how is this in line with your claims? Only two LLM-based models is not reflective of the goals of your statement. In addition, Claude is not even mentioned in the Introduction or anytime before Section 2.5, leaving the reader the impression you are only using GPT4.\n\nThe findings of the user study conducted by the authors are unsurprising. The length of the text is a well-known confounder in the evaluation of generated texts. Similarly, texts which contain grammatical errors can be quickly identified as having poor quality. Moreover, it is unsurprising that humans tend to be biased towards factually incorrect answers that look coherent and are grammatically correct (especially true if they lack in-domain knowledge). Besides, the authors make misleading statements when claiming LLMs reach consensus when in fact GPT-4 and Claude only reach moderate agreement, and that LLMs display some degree of fact checking abilities - hard to quantify this statement, since the lack of factuality is an open problem with current models. Similarly, the authors claim \u201cthe expert annotators outperform the crowd-sourced annotators in the evaluation, despite not being entirely error-free themselves.\u201d - this is a well known fact in the literature, however it is presented as if it were a novel insight which is very misleading! \n\n\u201cexpert annotators indeed prioritize factual accuracy during evaluation.\u201d -  of course, since they have in-domain knowledge. However, there is no discussion highlighting the relevance of the selected experts vs the selection of the specific domains the authors choose to focus on in this work.\n\n\u201cRegarding the \u201cHelpfulness\u201d dimension, both expert annotators and GPT-4 consistently consider longer answers to be more helpful.\u201d - of course, since they contain more information! Nevertheless, the authors only make vague assumptions and fail to quantify the degree of factuality to support their statements. \n\n\nThe setup is not consistent: it evaluates i) language proficiency, ii) factual accuracy, and iii) response length, and then proposes a rating system that accounts for  i) language, ii) accuracy, and iii) helpfulness. Helpfulness criteria is not clearly motivated, and its inclusion is inconsistent with the initial evaluation criteria. Besides, the paper does not clearly describe how this aspect is being evaluated, to whom it is helpful and in which contexts.\n\n\n\nThere is no clear motivation in the paper on why the authors chose to focus on these particular three aspects ( language proficiency, factual accuracy, and response length) of machine-generated texts. There are so many aspects of the generated texts that can be considered, and this paper fails to make a convincing argument on the selection of their evaluation criteria. While the authors acknowledge in the Discussion section that this may not be the perfect setup, they fail to motivate their experimental choice. \n\nThe paper fails to discuss limitations of human evaluation, as well as limitations of LLM-based evaluation with respect to findings already well-established in the literature. Their statements in the Discussion section are vague and unsupported by evidence. \n\nThe Related Work section is not very informative for the topic of the paper, particularly the paragraph focused on enumerating existing LLMs is not discussing evaluation at all (which is the main focus of the current paper). In addition, the authors fail to cite and refer to important bodies of work in the literature focused on both human and machine evaluation. I recommend a complete rewrite of this section and instead of presenting generalities, discuss papers that have addressed the same topic and are particularly relevant to your current work. \n\nIn general, the experiment setup decisions made in this paper seem rather arbitrary and not well documented / supported by the arguments presented. The authors fail to discuss and include significant papers focused on the evaluation of natural language generation (NLG) models, and do not place their work in the context of recent literature on NLG evaluation."

                        "value": "Thank you for your detailed and constructive feedback on our manuscript.\n\n1. Sample size and questions\n\nRegarding our dataset size of 40 questions, it is crucial to highlight the significant resource and cost implications involved in our study. The evaluation of these questions against twelve different models has led to **5280 individual comparisons**, with the total expenditure amounting to **thousands of USD**. This scale of analysis, while seemingly compact, is both resource-intensive and costly. \n\nMoreover, **our analysis demonstrates a consistent trend in the Elo rankings when sampling from these 40 questions**. This consistency indicates that the dataset is robust enough to yield reliable insights and trends. Therefore, we believe that the chosen sample size strikes an effective balance between comprehensive analysis and practical constraints.\n\n2. \"Games\"\n\n**Our use of the term \"games\" refers to pairwise comparisons of model outputs**, similar to chess matches in the Elo rating system. Each expert annotator evaluated 10 such comparisons. We will update our manuscript as you suggested.\n\n3. LLM Judges and Model Diversity\n\n**By definition, \u201cmultiple\u201d means \u201cmore than one\u201d, and our claim remains consistent with our methodology.** We incorporated Claude-1 alongside GPT-4 to counter potential biases, especially relevant since our answers were refined post-generation by GPT-4. The inclusion of more LLMs was considered; however, we had concerns about their capabilities in accurately evaluating model outputs, coupled with limited resources for this study. This decision was a strategic choice to maintain focus and ensure quality in our evaluation process.\n\n4. Unsurprising findings\n\nWe believe that the value of our study lies not only in uncovering new insights but also in empirically validating existing assumptions within the field. While some of our findings may align with general expectations, their empirical substantiation is a crucial contribution. This validation is particularly significant in a rapidly evolving field like natural language processing, where many widely-held beliefs have yet to be rigorously tested. Our study offers concrete evidence to support or question these beliefs, thus advancing the overall understanding of natural language generation evaluation. **We believe that unsurprising findings should not be a reason for rejection, as the single-score Elo rating is still widely adopted, and general expectations require rigorous scientific confirmation.**\n\nFurthermore, the study's design and the nuances of our findings offer deeper insights into the complexities of human and machine evaluations, going beyond mere confirmation of expected trends. For example, there are few grammatical errors in your review which are hard to be identified without the assistance of the grammar-checker. This actually confirms our claim that humans are not able to effectively identify the errors in the text. In summary, while some findings might seem predictable, their empirical confirmation and the detailed analysis provided are valuable contributions to the field.\n\n5. Setup inconsistencies\n\nThe initial phase of our evaluation concentrated on three key aspects: language proficiency, factual accuracy, and response length. These were selected to rigorously assess the biases of the LLM evaluation process. In transitioning to our Multi-Elo Rating System (MERS), we selected aspects i) language, ii) accuracy, and iii) helpfulness. This selection was made for demonstrative purposes, to showcase the system's capability in evaluating diverse and crucial elements of language generation. **It is important to note that our proposed MERS is adaptable and not limited to these three aspects.** The system is designed to be flexible, allowing for the inclusion of additional evaluation criteria as needed.\n\n6. Related Work\n\nIn the related work, we present numerous researches that are related to our study, **covering the literature of both large language models and evaluation methods.** We will include more specific references to works directly addressing NLG evaluation in our future revisions.\n\n7. Annotation workload\n\nTo ensure the annotation diversity and quality, we limit the annotation workload of each crowd-sourced annotator. **We recommend them to annotate no more than 20 samples.** Given that AMTurk doesn't have a built-in feature to enforce this limit, it serves as a general guideline for annotators. However, in practice, we do accommodate instances where annotators exceed this limit. Annotators can submit more than 20 annotations, but we closely monitor their contributions. **We choose to disregard submissions from any annotator who exceeds 50 annotations.**\n\n8. Helpfulness\n\nAs shown in Figure 11, we require the human annotators, including the crowd-sourced annotators and experts, to **consider the relevance of the information, whether it addresses the given question, and to take into account the depth of the response.**"
