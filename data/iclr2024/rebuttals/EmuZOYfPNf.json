The search space is limited to whether to include the adapter and LoRa structure and a couple of hyperparameters in these two structures.  Existing RL-based optimization is adopted. A comparison of the optimized model (after searching) to models containing adapter and LoRa alone is performed, and superior results of the model obtained by the proposed method are reported. Several relatively small datasets are employed in the experiments for the few-shot setting, and only one face dataset is adopted for the fine-tuning setting. The paper is overall easy to follow, while several critical concerns are detailed below."

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive comments! We appreciate your recognition of the effectiveness and novelty of our approach. Regarding your concern:\n\n+ Regarding the search space: We mainly considered two types of structures, namely insertion-based (similar to adapters) and bypass  (similar to LORA), along with their micro-structures and application positions. The search space in our paper covers various PEFT structures, and the potential design space is sufficiently large (10^12). Based on your suggestion, we will also consider incorporating elements such as tuning bias [4] into our search space, as well as exploring various improvements for LORA, such as DYLORA [1]. However, this will further increase our search space and bring additional search costs. We will try our best to explore and experiment with these possibilities.\n\n+ Regarding the comparison with other search methods: We have supplemented our paper with a comparison between our method and evolutionary algorithm-based[2] and random search-based approaches[3], as shown in the table below.\n\n\n| Method                                          | Flowers102 | CUB-200 Birds | Food101 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------|\n| LoRa                                            | 29.69      | 8.21          | 12.01   |\n| Random search [3]       | 47.21      | 23.42         | 17.82   |\n| Evolutionary search[2]         | 33.96      | 11.12         | 11.70   |\n| Ours                                            | **25.34**  | **6.63**      | **9.51**|\n\nWe searched 1000 samples for all. As shown in the table, random search and evolution-based search failed to optimize an effective structure and fell behind the naive LORA method. This is because, in such a large search space, methods based on random walks or tournament selection cannot achieve effective exploration. We will include this comparison in our revised version.\n\n\n+ Regarding the fine-tuning task dataset.  According to the description in Section 4.1 of the original paper, our fine-tuning task includes Oxford 102 Flower, Food101, SUN397,  Caltech101, CUB-200, ArtBench, and Stanford Cars. Therefore, it is not just a single dataset. In tables such as Table 1, we also provide performance comparisons of fine-tuning on different datasets.\n\nFinally, we would like to thank you again for your constructive feedback on our paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Valipour M, Rezagholizadeh M, Kobyzev I, et al.

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive comments! We appreciate your recognition of the effectiveness and novelty of our approach. Regarding your concern, we would like to respond as follows. \n\nFirstly, according to the ICLR guidelines, unpublished papers such as arXiv papers do not need to be included in the references. Based on your comment, we carefully read the references you mentioned and believe that they are indeed relevant to our work, so we will add them to our references. References 2 and 3 cannot be directly compared with our method, so they will be placed in the related work section. As for reference [1], there are some similarities between its motivation and ours, but our differences are as follows: \n\n+ The search space is different. Reference [1] only considers the insertion position of adapters, while our search space also includes details such as LORA-like and structure, resulting in a huge difference in search space, 20 vs. 10^12.\n+ The methods are different, with reference [1] using ANOVA analysis and our approach using reinforcement learning-based search.  \n+ The tasks are different, with reference [1] only considering the dreambooth task with a sample size of 10-15 images, while we conducted extensive experiments not only on the dreambooth task but also on the more popular fine-tuning task, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our method. We will include reference [1] in our updated version and compare it with our approach.\n\nAs for the comparison between reinforcement learning-based methods and other methods, this has been widely studied in numerous papers such as [6,7,8], which confirm that RL is a more popular search method. We also compared our method with random search [5] and evolution-based search [4], with the following results:\n\n| Method                                          | Flowers102 | CUB-200 Birds | Food101 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------|\n| LoRa                                            | 29.69      | 8.21          | 12.01   |\n| Random search [5]       | 47.21      | 23.42         | 17.82   |\n| Evolutionary search[4]         | 33.96      | 11.12         | 11.70   |\n| Ours                                            | **25.34**  | **6.63**      | **9.51**|\n\nWe all searched for 1000 samples. As shown in the table, random search and evolution-based search failed to optimize an effective structure and fell behind the naive LoRa method. This is because in such a large search space, methods based on random walks or tournament selection cannot achieve effective exploration. We will include this comparison in our revised version.\n\nFinally, we thank you for your constructive feedback and recognition of our work again.\n\n\n\n[1-3] As you suggests\n\n[4] Real E, Moore S, Selle A, et al.

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your constructive feedback! We appreciate your recognition of the novelty of our methods. Regarding your concern, we would like to respond as follows.\n\n+ Motivation for using RL: We aim to search architectures that have both low tuning cost and good performance, which is a multi-objective search task. The mainstream approach for solving this problem (multi-objective search)  mostly adopts the sample-eval-loop process based on reinforcement learning[1,2], so we followed their design. The power law in Eq.3 follows Mnas[2], which aims to balance the tuning performance and tuning cost, requiring a factor  for joint optimization objectives. In our revision, we will update the references and writing to help readers better understand our motivation.\n\n\n+ Regarding the comparison with other search methods: We have supplemented our paper with a comparison between our method and evolutionary algorithm-based[3] and random search-based approaches[4], as shown in the table below.\n\n| Method                                          | Flowers102 | CUB-200 Birds | Food101 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------|---------|\n| LoRa                                            | 29.69      | 8.21          | 12.01   |\n| Random search [4]       | 47.21      | 23.42         | 17.82   |\n| Evolutionary search[3]         | 33.96      | 11.12         | 11.70   |\n| Ours                                            | **25.34**  | **6.63**      | **9.51**|\n\nWe searched 1000 samples for all. As shown in the table, random search and evolution-based search failed to optimize an effective structure and fell behind the naive LORA method. This is because, in such a large search space, methods based on random walks or tournament selection cannot achieve effective exploration. We will include this comparison in our revised version.\n\n\n\n+ Regarding why the visual quality will be enhanced, better structure can lead to more effective transfer, ensuring good transfer performance in the target domain and closer distribution distance (e.g., FID for image tasks). This has been proven in various parameter-efficient fine-tuning applications in NLP.  Additionally, our method introduces human performance scores as part of the multi-object reward to better align the tuning results with human preferences. As a result, the tuned results have better visual quality.\n\n\n+ Regarding the writing. We appreciate your suggestions and will work on improving our writing.\n\n\n\nFinally, we thank you for your constructive feedback and recognition of our work again.\n\n[1] Zhou Y, Ebrahimi S, Ar\u0131k S \u00d6, et al.

Although the method looks somewhat interesting, but more rigor need to be shown both in writing and in response (e.g., the authors mention [5], which is not present in rebuttal). Also, the paper could be updated here, which the authors haven't done. Therefore, I am keeping my rating."
