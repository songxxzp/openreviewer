                    "value": "- Method:\n\n    - In the introduction (P2), the authors highlight the potential drawback of some existing works, citing \"heavy traffic for data communication\". However, the proposed method still necessitates the communication of embeddings of all server data to all active clients in each communication round. While the cost is lower compared to the aforementioned existing methods, the communication overhead remains considerable.\n    \n    - The paper claims novelty in the use of the label contrastive loss. However, the experiment does not explicitly demonstrate how this loss contributes to performance improvement. An ablation study could be beneficial to gauge the impact on method performance if the label contrastive loss were omitted or replaced by alternative loss functions. The current description underscores the novelty of the proposed method.\n\n    \n    - Too many hyper-parameters. In the local training (Section 3.3) step, various components contributing to the combined loss function. Parameters such as the threshold value, hyper-parameters for the Beta distribution, strong augmentation method, and size of the mixed dataset, among others, are introduced. However, the paper does not clarify how these hyper-parameters are selected or their potential effects on model performance.\n\n- Experiment:\n    - The experiment results in Table 1 for CIFAR100 with 10000 anchor data are puzzling, as the performance of the semi-supervised learning method markedly surpasses that of the supervised learning method in the IID case. This anomaly warrants clarification.\n\n\n    - The description for Figure 3 is unclear. It is not apparent what the lines represent. Additionally, it is ambiguous whether pseudo-label accuracy and classification accuracy are averaged over all datasets or pertain to a single client. Furthermore, the legends for the two datasets are inconsistent.\n    \n\n- Other issues:\n    - There is a notable absence of related work such as [1] -- [4]. These works should be compared to or at least discussed in the related work.\n\n    - Including a descriptive table to highlight the advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches would enhance the paper.\n\n\n    - The paper needs to be proofread more carefully. Instances of notation inconsistency, key notation typos, and repeated reference entries should be addressed. For instance:\n\n        - On P3, the paragraph discussing Federated Learning uses two separate notations, $G^t$ and $L_i^{t}$, to represent global and local models, respectively. These notations are inconsistent with the rest of the manuscript where the weight 'w' is used to denote different models.\n\n        - The notation for the unlabeled set in the paragraph on Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (P3) is clearly incorrect.\n\n        - The format of the bibliography entries is inconsistent, with some entries including URLs while others do not.\n\n        - There are repeated reference entries for FedMatch (Jeong et al., 2020).\n    \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] FedCon: A contrastive framework for federated semi-supervised learning\n\n[2] Federated semi-supervised medical image classification via inter-client relation matching\n\n[3] Dynamic bank learning for semi-supervised federated image diagnosis with class imbalance\n\n[4] Towards unbiased training in federated open-world semi-supervised learning\n\n[5] Rethinking semi-supervised federated learning: How to co-train fully-labeled and fully-unlabeled client imaging data"

                        "value": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for their helpful comments and remarks. We have now addressed all of the concerns below.\n\n- Concern about the communication load: The communication load is minor (please refer to A.3, Table 2 in our revised manuscript).\n- Concern about too many hyper-parameters: The hyper-parameters of beta, augmentation method, and size of the mixed dataset remain the same as the existing papers (such as FixMatch, MixMatch, and SemiFL). As for the threshold value, it could be dataset-dependent. We selected the value 0.6 on CIFAR 10 and kept the same for other datasets to show the generalization of our method.\n- Concern about the supervised baseline: For a fair comparison, we used a standard supervised baseline, where we did not conduct strong augmentation and the model was not pre-trained with anchor data (as mentioned in the caption of Table 1). Implementing a strong augmentation method is not so common in the benchmark results (such as in FedAdam [1], Fjord [2], and ZeroFL [3]), but for semi-supervised learning, people normally use a strong augmentation method, which we do the same.\n- Description for Figure 3: Please see more explanations in the revised version of the paper, which we highlighted in Section 4.3.\n- Concern about the absence of related work: Thanks for pointing out the papers. We have added FedCon as a baseline (please kindly refer to the general response point number 1 to all reviewers for more details) and included others in the background in our revised manuscript.\n- Regarding other comments: Thanks for the feedback. We have updated our revised manuscript.\n\n[1] Reddi, Sashank, et al. \"Adaptive federated optimization.\"\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2003.00295*\u00a0(2020).\n\n[2] Horvath, Samuel, et al. \"Fjord: Fair and accurate federated learning under heterogeneous targets with ordered dropout.\"\u00a0*Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*\u00a034 (2021): 12876-12889. \n\n[3] Qiu, Xinchi, et al. \"ZeroFL: Efficient on-device training for federated learning with local sparsity.\"\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2208.02507*\u00a0(2022)."

We now addressed all of the concerns below.\n\n- Concern about novelty: We acknowledge that the general idea of label contrastive loss is not new, but we are the first to leverage it in federated semi-supervised learning to improve the quality of pseudo-labeling. Besides, all existing papers in federated/centralized SSL use the model-predicted results to generate pseudo labels. In our method, we for-the-first-time utilize the latent representation\u2019s cosine similarity for pseudo-labeling and achieve a new SOTA performance. This provides a new solution for the general semi-supervised learning area.\n- Concern about missing literature: Thanks for pointing out the papers. For [2], it is an earlier paper than SemiFL and performs worse than SemiFL, as we mentioned in the background section of our paper. Additionally, we have added FedCon as a baseline in our revised manuscript and included pFedKnow, FedIL, and FedSiam in the background section.\n- Concern about the supervised baseline: For a fair comparison, we used a standard supervised baseline, where we did not conduct strong augmentation and the model was not pre-trained with anchor data (as mentioned in the caption of Table 1). This is the main reason supervised baseline performs poorly in some cases, especially when the anchor set is bigger."

FedAnchor adopts a unique double-head structure, integrating a label contrastive loss based on cosine similarity. This approach optimizes the use of limited labeled anchor data on the server and generates high-quality pseudo-labels, addressing issues like confirmation bias and overfitting common in pseudo-labeling approaches. Besides, the paper conducts extensive experiments across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that FedAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both convergence rate and model accuracy."

                "strengths": {
                    "value": "1) The proposed label contrastive loss is interesting. Although this new loss is essentially a combination of existing contrastive loss (Info NCE Loss) and the cosine similarity metric, it can be seen from the formula as well as the provided figure that it does bring the same category representations closer and different category representations further apart in the latent feature space. Thus, despite the limited novelty in loss design, I still endorse this as an important contribution.\n2) This paper provides a good introduction of the new FSSL method, FedAnchor. In particular, the methodology section has a nice flow and well summarizes the training of FedAnchor proceed on the server and clients at each communication round. The included pseudocode of FedAnchor is easy to understand.\n3) FedAnchor addresses an important problem of FSSL research work: the low convergence rate. The experimental results show that FedAnchor significantly prevails the SOTA FSSL baselines in terms of convergence."
                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1) The key concern about the paper is the number of SOTA FSSL methods used for comparisons is insufficient. In paper, FedAnchor was compared with supervised learning and SemiFL, while the only meaningful baseline is SemiFL. The finding that a single SOTA FSSL method does not perform as well as fedAnchor is not enough to prove that FedAnchor can outperform all SOTA FSSL methods. Moreover, FedAnchor does not seem to consistently outperform SemiFL. It can be seen in Table 1 that FedAnchor's results on CIFAR100 could be worse than SemiFL when 10000 anchor data was given.\n2) Another concern is whether it makes sense in federated learning for a client to download the latent representations of the anchor data from the server to generate pseudo-labels. Federated learning methods often put data privacy at the first priority, so it may be not practical to disclose the complete latent representations of the data on server to each client. Moreover, according to the pseudo-labelling procedure defined in the paper, the obtained latent representations of the anchor data have to be compared with the latent representation of each local data. Under this setting, when the server data and the client's data scale up to a large amount, the effort of pseudo-labelling will be significant. Therefore, I doubt if FedAnchor can be applied to real scenarios.\n3) Furthermore, the method section mentions that FedAnchor adopts mixup during the local training on clients. The mixup operation seems to be a crucial trick to improve the accuracy of FedAnchor as shown by the results of Table 1. Why are there no additional ablation studies in the paper on the effect of mixup on FedAnchor convergence and accuracy? Can FedAnchor's performance still be ahead of SemiFL when mixup is not available?\n\nMinor Comment\n1) The introduction and background sections are a bit lengthy. Since FedAnchor corresponds to federated semi-supervised learning rather than federated learning, the introduction to federated learning and semi-supervised learning should be shortened.\n2) The font sizes of the legends and axis scales in the figures are too small to read.\n3) In equation 9, it should be \u201c(x_{fix}, y^{fix})\u201d instead of \u201c(x_{mix}, y^{fix})\u201d if my understanding about the method is not wrong."

Please kindly refer to the general response to all reviewers. \n- Concerns about the privacy of downloading the latent representations of the anchor data. In our paper, we assume that a small amount of labeled data will be stored on the server, which we call anchor data. We think it is a realistic and practical setup and is mentioned in the introduction. Even if we don\u2019t assume the anchor data is public, since the size of the anchor embedding is significantly smaller than the raw data (we chose 128 in our experiments), it alone is not sufficient to reverse-engineer and reconstruct the raw data.\n- Concerns about scalability. We have addressed this in the general response to all reviewers. Please kindly refer to point number 3 there.\n- Concern about the use of Mixup. Mixup is commonly used in centralized semi-supervised learning settings and is a SemiFL component. We have shown the effect of mixup in our original manuscript (Table 1, Figure 2, 4, 5), named FedAnchor and FedAnchor (mixup).\n- Regarding the font sizes, we will address this for the camera-ready version.\n- Response to Equation 9. Our original equation is correct. Since $x_{mix}$ is already a mixup of $x^{fix}$ and $x^{mix}$, the $y$, as you mentioned, should be as \u201c(x_{mix}, y^{fix})\u201d  for the first part."

We now addressed all of the concerns below.\n\n- Concern about the novelty: We acknowledge that the general idea of latent representation and cosine similarity is not new in machine learning, which has been used in different areas and applications. The references provided by the reviewer mainly focus on dealing with data/label noise, which is not the concern of our paper. We for-the-first-time leverage the idea of latent representation\u2019s cosine similarity to generate pseudo-labels in semi-supervised learning under the FL setup and achieve a new SOTA performance. The provided references can be good motivation papers, which we have cited in the background section (please see our new manuscript). Also, the method FedCon borrows the idea of using 2 models from BYOL without implementing any contrastive loss, despite the name.\n- Contributions in addition to using FixMatch and MixMatch: 1. A unique pseudo-labeling method in FSSL described above; 2.  A novel label contrastive loss to further improve the quality of pseudo labels.\n- FedCon baseline: We have added this comparison in Table 1, section 4.2. Please kindly refer to general response point number (1) for this point."

                        "value": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for taking the time to review. \n\n- Regarding the first question: If we look at the training curve, we can see that, for this case, the IID curve and the non-IID curve are very similar. We have also attached the plot showing the training curve to Appendix 4 in the newly uploaded manuscript. The testing accuracy between IID and non-IID is similar because, during each round, it also trains on the labeled and balanced anchor data in a supervised learning way. The training using anchor data is supervized and centralized. Also, we observe that solely training on the anchor data with strong augmentation techniques can achieve 40% for anchor size 5000. Through the observation, we can see that the FedCon baseline extracts limited information from the unlabeled data on the client side. Therefore, this reduces the effect of client data distribution (IID/non-IID) for FedCon.\n- Regarding the second question: Since we would like to show that the choice of model architecture would not impact our method, we adopt the more popular and standard model architecture ResNet-18 in our manuscript, but in SemiFL, they use the Wide-ResNet model architecture. Resnet-18 is capable of the image classification task and identifies the \"embedding\" part of its architecture. Apart from the model architecture, the semiFL implementation, we follows their experimental settings.\n\nWe understand you're busy. But as the window for responding and paper revision is closing, would you mind checking our response and confirming whether you have any further questions? We are happy to provide answers and revisions to your additional questions. If our reply resolves your concern, please kindly consider raising the score accordingly. Many thanks!"
