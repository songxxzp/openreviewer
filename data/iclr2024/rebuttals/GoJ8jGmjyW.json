However, training on such data presents challenges, primarily due to the limited guidance offered by video subtitles for text-visual learning. \nIn this paper, it tackle this issue by harnessing the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs). The paper introduces a novel method called HowToCaption, which entails instructing an LLM to generate detailed video captions based on automatic speech recognition (ASR) subtitles. \nTo assess the effectiveness of the proposed HowToCaption method, the authors have curated a comprehensive HowToCaption dataset.This research showcases the potential of large-language models in creating annotation-free, large-scale text-video datasets."

In order to adequately address the reviewer's concerns, we would be grateful if the reviewer could elaborate and provide additional details regarding the potential weaknesses of our submission.\n\n\n> Novelty is insufficient. This paper propose a approach, HowToCaption, prompting an LLM to create detailed video captions based on ASR subtitles. However, similar methods have been used widely in dataset industry, including Tencent, OpenAI and so on ...\n\nIf the reviewer could provide relevant references or suggestions regarding other methods to compare to that we might have missed, we are happy to provide additional comparisons to and discussions of those methods. \n\nMoreover, we would like to highlight that we pioneer a novel method involving data collection with LLMs for text-video learning, offering significant advancements in the field. This stands in contrast to recent works in prompt engineering [1,2], which focus on prompting LLMs to address pre-existing tasks. We also release a new large-scale dataset, HowToCaption, which contains high-quality video descriptions for instructional videos. Please also note that this is why we chose \"Dataset and Benchmark\" as the primary subject area, which is in line with the ICRL CfP. \n\n[1] Kojima, Takeshi, et al. \"Large language models are zero-shot reasoners.\" NeurIPS, 2022. \n\n[2] Zhou, Yongchao, et al. \"Large language models are human-level prompt engineers.\" ICLR 2023\n\n> Firstly, in ablation study, the authors need to evaluate different speech recognition methods.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. In our work, we utilized subtitles and timestamps, officially released with the HowTo100M dataset[3], that were further postprocess into full sentences by [4] (Sentencified HowTo100M). In our preliminary study, we also experimented with the recently released WhisperX model[5] to obtain better quality subtitles and with the original officially released HowTo100M[3] subtitles. We found that all subtitles show similar performance. We report these preliminary results (note that this study is done only on 10k HowTo100M videos): \n\n|                           |   R1 |   R5 |  R10 |   MR |\n|---------------------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|-----:|\n| Original ASR subtitles [3] | 26.6 | 46.5 | 55.1 |   17 |\n| Sentencified subtitles [4] | 26.6 | 46.5 | 55.3 | 16.8 |\n| WhisperX[5] subtitles      | 26.2 | 46.4 | 55.3 | 16.6 |\n\nWe observe that the quality of different ASR methods does not significantly alter the quality of the acquired dataset. We assume that the noise introduced in ASR-video alignment is inherent to the nature of speech, often not aligning precisely with the content of the video. Moreover, filtering and alignment postprocessing that filter noisy captions might further mitigate the difference. We will include it in the paper. \n\n[3] Miech, Antoine, et al. \"Howto100m: Learning a text-video embedding by watching hundred million narrated video clips.\" ICCV, 2019.\n\n[4] Han, Tengda, Weidi Xie, and Andrew Zisserman. \"Temporal alignment networks for long-term video.\" CVPR, 2022.\n\n[5] Bain, Max, et al. \"WhisperX: Time-accurate speech transcription of long-form audio.\" INTERSPEECH, 2023."

Moreover, prompting the LLM to assist in text-video alignment is compelling. One could speculate that the commonsense knowledge or reasoning ability inherent in LLMs could greatly enhance alignment results. The qualitative samples depicted in Figure 2 appear impressive. The authors intend to make the dataset and code publicly available.\n\n+) The ablation study in Table 1 clearly demonstrates the design choice behind the proposed prompting mechanism. Yet, it is somewhat surprising that, as per Table 2, long context information only yields marginal improvements in downstream tasks. The analysis of the effects of filtering and alignment also highlights the necessity for robust text-clip alignment annotations.\n\n+) The zero-shot text-to-video retrieval results depict improvements from training BLIP on the newly assembled dataset. Although the progression seems marginal compared to WebVid2M data, Table 5 showcases that BLIP training on the proposed dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance in the text-to-video retrieval task.\n\n+) The zero-shot text-video+audio retrieval outcomes highlight the strength of the proposed dataset, as models trained on it seemingly perform better."

For instance, what is the alignment accuracy when implementing the proposed filter/alignment technique? This would help subsequent users understand the noise level they might encounter when using the dataset.\n\n-) Merely a few qualitative examples are presented in Figures 1 and 2, with no instances of failure cases. It would be beneficial if the authors included a broader range of generated sentences in the appendix, encompassing both successful and subpar examples.

In the following, we will try to address the remaining concerns: \n\n**Questions:**\n\n> Can the authors present more qualitative examples from the newly introduced dataset, including both exemplary and flawed examples?\n\nThanks for the valuable suggestion! We have updated the Appendix (Section A.6) with additional qualitative examples of the HowToCaption dataset, including failure cases (see updated pdf). We aim to update the paper even with more examples in the next days.\n\n> Could the authors share some qualitative results for the text-video(+audio) retrieval tasks?\n\nWe highly appreciate the suggestion. We will update the Appendix with qualitative retrieval results as well. \n\n> Would the authors clarify why evaluations were restricted to retrieval tasks using BLIP? Is it feasible to assess the model's performance in visual captioning or question-answering scenarios?\n \nWe value the suggestion and are initiating further evaluations. While we aim to present results within the discussion period, a thorough analysis may require additional time. In the meanwhile, we provide preliminary zero-shot video clip captioning results on the YouCook2 dataset after only 1 epoch of training on 10% of the HowToCaption dataset, with the captioning model initialized from BLIP (note, we do not do any finetuning on YouCook2):\n\n|      | BLEU@4 | METEOR | ROUGE | CIDEr |\n|------|:------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n| BLIP |   0.7  |   4.4  |  9.8  |  12.6 |\n| Ours |    2.7 |    8.3 |  21.8 |  28.5 |\n\nFor the main evaluation, we chose the retrieval setting, as it does not depend on downstream training or fine-tuning, which evaluates the influence of our dataset directly. Other downstream tasks, such as captioning, often require fine-tuning on the downstream dataset and, therefore, evaluate the pre-training dataset only indirectly, as the final performance depends on many dataset-specific hyper-parameters of training the downstream task. \n\n> The font size in Figure 1 appears too small.\n\nThank you for pointing out the issue! We will enlarge the font in Figure 1 to make it more readable. \n\n> Considering the generality of the proposed framework, which should be applicable to any video-text dataset, have the authors considered employing these techniques across all publicly available benchmarks to train a large-scale video-language model?\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion to apply our techniques across all publicly available benchmarks. We fully agree that the HowToCaption method is generalizable to other datasets. Applying it across all publicly available instructional video datasets to transform ASR into captions could significantly contribute to training foundational models at a large scale. We will release the code and dataset for our work, anticipating that it will inspire and accelerate research in this field.\n\n\nPlease let us know if you have any other questions or concerns regarding our paper or response."

In the following, we would like to address the remaining concerns.\n\n\n> This work is more of a prompt engineering than a research paper\n \nWe would like to highlight that our main contribution is twofold: we release a new large-scale dataset, HowToCaption, which contains high-quality video descriptions for instructional videos, and we design a human-free framework to transform noisy ASR subtitles into high-quality captions for instructional videos. Essentially, enabling data collection with LLMs for text-video learning offers significant advancements in the field. This stands in contrast to recent works in prompt engineering [1,2], which focus on prompting LLMs to address pre-existing tasks. We hope that the impact of this work might, therefore, be not only a better annotation for one specific dataset but also pave the way towards a general better practice in crawling and processing large amounts of video. Please also note that this is why we chose \"Dataset and Benchmark\" as the primary subject area, which is in line with the ICRL CfP.\n\n[1] Kojima, Takeshi, et al. \"Large language models are zero-shot reasoners.\" NeurIPS, 2022. \n\n[2] Zhou, Yongchao, et al. \"Large language models are human-level prompt engineers.\" ICLR 2023\n\n\n> It would be better to evaluate the proposed dataset on more challenging tasks, e.g., dense video captioning or moment retrieval\n\nFor the main evaluation, we chose the retrieval setting, as it does not depend on downstream training or fine-tuning, which evaluates the influence of our dataset directly. \nOther downstream tasks, such as captioning, evaluate the pre-training dataset only indirectly, as the final performance depends on many dataset-specific hyper-parameters of training the downstream task.\nNonetheless, we value the suggestion and are initiating further evaluations.

This begs the question why does the community need to use the proposed dataset of 25M as opposed to Vid2.5M + CC3M. \n\n**Terminology usage:** \n- In section 3.1, the authors mention that the aim is to \"generate\" captions. However, the term \"generate\" might be mis-leading as the LLM merely \"rephrases\" semantically the ASR subtitle within a time-step in a more human-alike sentence and doesn't add any new details. \n- In section 3.3, the authors hint at \"fine-grained\" captions, I am not fully convinced that LLMs always produces better fine-grained captions. Sometimes, they add new unrelated details to the ASR subtitles. Since no quantifiable measure is provided in the paper, I would suggest the authors avoid this terminology."

                        "value": "Thanks for taking the time to review our paper, highlighting the clarity and significance of our paper, and providing valuable feedback! We would like to address the raised points in the following:\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n\n>Unclear advantages of using this dataset on video retrieval task.  \n\nThanks for asking. LAVENDER uses a multi-modal encoder (i.e., that cross-attends video and text tokens) and only reports results after fine-tuning on each dataset. \nThis differs from the evaluation in Table 5 in 2 ways: first, we focus on the comparison of dual-encoder SOTA methods (i.e., methods that do not cross-attend video and text tokens), second we consider zero-shot text-to-video performance rather than fine-tuned performance (performance of the models fine-tuned on each downstream task). We decided for this setup to evaluate the properties of the proposed dataset as a pretraining dataset for foundational models. To allow for an indirect comparison, we compare the fine-tuned performance reported by the LAVENDER method for MSR-VTT and MSVD with our zero-shot performance. It shows that pretraining with the proposed annotations provides a comparable performance even without cross-modal attention or any supervised fine-tuning.\n\n| | pre-training | fine-tuning | MSR-VTT (R1) | MSVD (R1) |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| LAVENDER | WebVid2.5+CC3M | **yes** | 37.8 | 46.3 |\n| Ours     | HowToCaption | **no** | 37.6 | 44.5 | \n\nWe, therefore, assume that using our HowToCaption dataset will boost LAVENDER performance as well. \n\nWe want to highlight that we intentionally do not report methods that rely on a multi-modal encoder and are trained with image-text-matching loss rather than a contrastive loss. Such methods show an improved performance compared to dual-encoder models but require significantly higher computation costs to perform retrieval. They require a full forward pass for each (video, text) pair to output the similarity of this input pair ($N^2$ forward passes to compute the similarity between $N$ text and $N$ videos), while dual-encoder methods calculate cosine similarity in embedding space ($2N$ forward passes only). For a fair comparison (and as we want to test the data rather than the method), we therefore consider dual-encoder methods.\n\n>the term \"generate\" might be misleading as the LLM merely \"rephrases\"  \n\nWhile we task the LLM to _rephrase_ the caption, we are using the term _generate_ here as an LLM is fundamentally a generative model with no inherent guarantee that its output is aligned with the task. We will make this more clear in the paper.\n\n> In section 3.3, the authors hint at \"fine-grained\" captions, I am not fully convinced that LLMs always produces better fine-grained captions:  \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's feedback. We agree that the term \"fine-grained\" might be misleading. We will revise the paper to avoid this terminology."
