                    "value": "Due to the requirements of the expected trajectory segmentations into a discrete set of skills, current methods mostly discretize commonalities among gait types, leading to less smooth transitions. To overcome these problems, the authors introduced Gaitor, leveraging a unified representation to capture the correlations among gait types. With the help of terrain encoding and a learned panner operation, Gaitor can take motion commands into account. Specifically, a modified variational autoencoder is applied to infer the robot's current and estimate the future state, which is also determined by the terrain latent space from the autoencoder. The evaluation is in simulated and real-world settings."

We have found it most useful in improving our work.\n\nWe have focused our attention on the presentation of the revised paper. In particular, we have restructured the methods section to improve the clarity of the approach and significantly revised Fig 1 and 2 so that the former acts as a deployment diagram, while the latter explains the training regime much more clearly. The revisions that we have made to our paper are in blue in the updated paper.\n\n\nWe also contextualise the contributions of this work in relation to current art in particular Locomotion-Transformer. Gaitor is a representation learning method and does not use RL or exploration to solve locomotion problems. Instead, we learn a compact 2D representation for locomotion, which is trained using distinct gait. However, we discover that the approach exploits the phase correlations between the robot\u2019s legs to create the representation meaning that, through traversal through the space, intermediate gaits are automatically discovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of generating novel intermediate gaits and does this without the use of RL or exploration of the state space. Furthermore, we show that these continuous transitions between gaits are dynamically feasible by deploying on the real Anymal C platform.\n\nWe believe that our contributions have significant promise and ask for guidance as to how we can strengthen the revised manuscript so that it can showcase the contributions of our work. \n\nKind regards, \n\nAnon."

                    "value": "1. \" All pose orientations are represented in tangent space.\" Can you specify what you mean here?\n\n2. I don't quite understand why it is called a VAE instead of just a neural network that maps input to output. My understanding is that a VAE will try to reconstruct the input at its output, but that doe not seem to be the case here. Perhaps this is why I am very confused when reading the paper. My understanding is the proposed \"VAE\" learns to project the input to a latent space, which is then used to reconstruct the output (which is different from the input). VAE is also used when given the same input to generate multiple plausible outputs, in the context of robots, say given the same user command velocity, generates different gaits that can follow this velocity. I am not sure where is the variational part in the proposed vae.\n\n3.  \"The gait input is a label for each gait. This can be a one-hot encoding for each gait or a slider, where the three gaits, trot, crawl, and pace are [1, 0, \u22121]. The latter is recommended for its simplicity, but the one hot encoding produces the same results and\npermits smooth transitions between gaits.\" I am confused by this sentence, who recommended the latter (and what is the latter?) And are you using this recommended option or are you using the one-hot encoding? And this performance predictor is never used again (I search for PP and performance predictor), what is it used for in the whole system?\n\n4. I am not sure how the different components are used after training. My naive guess is the past trajectory is fed into the vae, and then output the future trajectory for robot control. The encoding of the inputs can be modified by the planner to adjust gaits. It would be nice to make it clearer how the system works.\n\n5. Why is an additional planner needed to deal with terrains since terrain is already an input to the decoder and the training data for the decoder and planner are the same (or could be the same)? Maybe an ablation study is needed?"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer A1WD,\n\nWe have focused our attention on the presentation of the revised paper. In particular, we have restructured the methods section to improve the clarity of the approach and significantly revised Fig 1 and 2 so that the former acts as a deployment diagram, while the latter explains the training regime much more clearly. The revisions that we have made to our paper are in blue in the updated paper.\n\nWe have significantly improved the clarity of the paper and ask you to revisit our contributions. Our work, Gaitor, is a representation learning method and does not use RL or exploration to solve locomotion problems. Instead, we learn a compact 2D representation for locomotion, which is trained using distinct gaits. However, we discover that the approach exploits the phase correlations between the robot\u2019s legs to create the representation meaning that, through traversal through the space, intermediate gaits are automatically discovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of generating novel intermediate gaits and does this without the use of RL or exploration of the state space. Furthermore, we show that these continuous transitions between gaits are dynamically feasible by deploying on the real Anymal C platform. We ask for guidance as to how we can strengthen the revised manuscript so that it can showcase the contributions of our work. \n\n\n\n\nWe address your individual remarks as follows:\n\n1. We explain in the revised manuscript that the tangent space is a representation for the Lie-algebra of 3D rotations and is commonly used for robot control and state estimation. We include two citations as examples of how it is used in the wider literature also. Expressing coordinate transforms in the tangent-space has the benefit that non-linear composition of coordinate frames becomes linear vector algebra in the tangent space.\n\n2. There are multiple reasons why we use a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) instead of an Auto-Encoder (AE). The first is that during training, the generative nature of the training process compresses our latent space meaning that we find a compact 2D representation for locomotion. This is crucial as properties of locomotion such as swing height and length are disentangled within the 2D space - while these are not explicitly varied parameters in the training set. This means we can solve for any locomotion problem using a trajectory in the 2D manifold. Complete details of this discussion can be found in prior work VAE-Loco. Thus, we refer the reader to this paper in Section 3.2, which discusses these findings in our paper.\nWe use our learnt 2D latent-space to plan locomotion trajectories within. As we mention in the revised methods section 3, the latent space forms a solution space in which we select a single solution by traversing the space. Indeed, we are using the VAE to learn this manifold and as mentioned the generative training paradigm ensures that this space contains only the principal components necessary to reconstruct the locomotion trajectories.\n\n3. We have simplified the gait label and removed reference to a one-hot encoding. This more clearly explains how we train the model and then during operation choose the desired gait. \nWe also explain in greater detail what the Performance Predictors (PP) do. During training they help to structure the latent space: this was discovered in work done by prior authors in VAE-Loco. Secondly, we need to estimate the contact state of the robot and predict the future states so that the Whole-Body Controller (WBC) can take care of the contact-state dynamics. The PP predicts the future contact states and these are provided to the WBC.\n\n4. We have clarified the deployment of Gaitor in two ways. Firstly, we have revised section 3.4 to explain this much more clearly. Secondly, we have revised Fig. 1 so that it explains the deployment process more clearly. Fig 1 is split into three panels which explain inference, planning and construction of the trajectories. \n\n\n5. We clarify the contribution of the learnt planner in the revised Results Section 4. The planner exploits the latent-space structure  and is used to adjust the swing characteristics in response to terrain. Additionally, the modulation of the trajectory in latent-space is evident when we encode the expert trajectories. \n\n\nKind regards, \n\nAnon."

A VAE latent space is trained on examples of expert trajectories. The paper uses the observation made by Mitchell'23 that good controllers can be created as elliptical trajectories in that latent space. The controller learns to predict an appropriate elliptical trajectory conditioned on terrain features. It is shown that the method can be used to automatically transition between gaits by representing the desired gait on a scale (trot = 1, crawl = 0, pace = -1) and continuously interpolating this variable. This experiment was performed in simulation, but transitioning between trot and crawl is possible on the real robot too."

Figure 1 presumably depicts the same information but is not helpful for understanding the method since Sec 3.1 doesn't reference the figure. The reader needs to guess what is the correspondence between the text and the figure. See e.g. Hafner'20 for an example of good presentation.\n  - Eq 1. Y, U, s are undefined. The LTI function is never mentioned in the rest of the paper. Since all of the symbols are undefined, it is unclear whether this is used in the method at all, and if yes where. \n  - \"Training the VAE and Terrain AE\" section: terrain encoder is undefined. Unclear how $\\hat\\theta_c(k)$ is produced. The VAE loss as far as I can tell doesn't depend on the terrain encoder, so it's unclear how the terrain encoder can be trained with those gradients. The terrain decoder is undefined.\n  - There is a missing reference in the second line of Sec 2.\n  - The citation for GECO is wrong.

In particular, we have restructured the methods section to improve the clarity of the approach and significantly revised Fig 1 and 2 so that the former acts as a deployment diagram, while the latter explains the training regime much more clearly. The revisions that we have made to our paper are in blue in the updated paper.\n\nWe also contextualise the contributions of this work in relation to current art in particular Locomotion-Transformer. Gaitor is a representation learning method and does not use RL or exploration to solve locomotion problems. Instead, we learn a compact 2D representation for locomotion, which is trained using distinct gaits. However, we discover that the approach exploits the phase correlations between the robot\u2019s legs to create the representation meaning that, through traversal through the space, intermediate gaits are automatically discovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of generating novel intermediate gaits and does this without the use of RL or exploration of the state space. Furthermore, we show that these continuous transitions between gaits are dynamically feasible by deploying on the real Anymal C platform.\n\nWe also motivate why inferring the gait phase is of great importance. The discovery that the VAE can infer the gait phase is a fundamental discovery of our work, and in the revised results section, we explain that this representation directly results in the automatic discovery of novel gaits for gait transition. Furthermore, these new gaits are dynamically feasible.\n\n\nWe also believe that our contributions have significant promise and have greatly improved the clarity of the work's presentation. Thus, we ask for suggestions as to how we can strengthen the revised manuscript so that it can showcase the contributions and impact of our work. \n\n\nKind regards, \n\nAnon."

The paper lacks any ablation analysis. In addition, if no suitable baselines exist, comparing to new naive baselines should still be possible. Alternatively, more extensive real world experiments could be presented with clear applications of the proposed method."

The model is composes of 3 segments: (1) a VAE which encodes history of robot states (proprioceptive) into latent embeddings and decodes to future sequence of states and footholds, (2) an AE which encodes local terrain heightmap filtered using LTI in frequency domain based on future footholds and decodes the same and (3) a planner MLP which takes the phase of the motion and terrain latent to output the radius of an elliptical trajectory in polar coordinates. The latent embedding of past trajectory is filtered to remove high-frequency components as most information is captured by the low-frequency components and then converted into polar form with phase angles. In the polar form, the radius predicted by the planner is used to modulate the latent space to adjust foot-step height and lengths. The proposed setup is demonstrated on a real-world scene."

Further, the authors do not justify their choices via suitable ablations which weakens the overall contributions of their method. Please answer the questions below:\n\nHow are the latent visualizations constructed specifically? From the material in the paper, it seems like only two lowest-variance (low-frequency, low noise) components of VAE latent embedding are selected and transformed into polar coordinates about the mean as center?\n\nIf only the selected components are modulated by the planner predictions of radius, are other components of the latent space discarded before input to decoder? If not, what happens if they are discarded? Else vice-versa? From the context, it seems those are high-frequency components and do not contain much information.\n\nThe inference pipeline is not clearly mentioned anywhere. The inputs are the history of states to the VAE which gives a latent trajectory representation. Now, how are the heightmap features calculated? The paper mentions \u201cThe height of the terrain at the future footholds are measured from this height map\u201d. How do you get the future footholds? How are the predicted states used?\n\nThere has to be an appendix section clearly mentioning the construction of LTI transfer function for getting $y_k$ from $\\theta_k$. What is $y_k$? How is $\\theta_k$ constructed? How do you define angle between FL/FR and RR/RL? What is $w$ in equation (1)?\nWithout any definition, the authors have introduced the subscript \u201c$c$\u201d in equation (4)? Which when followed in section 3.2 becomes more confusing. What are $C$-discrete bins? What is $r^*$?\n\nThe paper is not very understandable at this point. However, it gives the readers an intuition of what is happening and how it is useful in understanding continuous transition between multiple gaits. \n\nThe paper contains remarks like \u201cFor example, it is possible to transition from trot to crawl to pace and the reverse only\u201d without any reason."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer ST69,\n\nThank you for your review, we have found the comments very useful.\n\nThe consensus between reviewers is that though the soundness of the research is good, the presentation is poor. Therefore, we have focused on this area to improve the paper. In particular, we have restructured the methods section to improve the clarity of the approach and revised Fig 1 and 2 so that the former acts as a deployment diagram, while the latter explains the training regime much more clearly. The revisions that we have made to our paper are in blue in the updated paper.\n\nAs a result of our modifications, we ask the reviewers to reevaluate our work and our contributions. Gaitor is a representation learning method and does not use RL or exploration to solve locomotion problems. Instead, we learn a compact 2D representation for locomotion, which is trained using distinct gait. However, we discover that the approach exploits the phase correlations between the robot\u2019s legs to create the representation meaning that, through traversal through the space, intermediate gaits are automatically discovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method capable of generating novel intermediate gaits and does this without the use of RL or exploration of the state space. Furthermore, we show that these continuous transitions between gaits are dynamically feasible by deploying on the real Anymal C platform.\n\nBefore we address your specific comments, we ask for guidance as to how we can strengthen the revised manuscript so that it can showcase the contributions of our work. \n\n\n\nResponses to your specific queries:\n\nTo address your first comment, we explain more clearly how the latent-space images are created in Section 3.2 and refer the reader to a long-form recipe for creating these that we used from prior work found in VAE-Loco. We explain that a 2D slice in latent space is sufficient to reconstruct locomotion trajectories to a high fidelity.\n\n\nWe explain the inference pipeline in much greater detail in the revised Section 3.4 and have significantly revised Fig. 1 to explain how the inference works whilst Gaitor is deployed on the real robot. We also have a new Fig. 3 which explains how the terrain is processed before it is encoded into latent space. This figure is referred to in Section 3.1, where we also explain how we predict the future footholds.\n\nWe have addressed weaknesses 4 and 5 together. We have clarified how the VAE learns to represent the locomotion data in Section 4 (Gait Switching subsection). This more clearly explains how the VAE infers the relative phases between all the legs to learn a compact representation for the multiple gaits. This structure in the latent space explains why gait transitions can only move from trot to crawl and then to pace.\n\nThank you for your reviews. I hope to hear your thoughts on the updated manuscript soon.\n\nKind regards, \n\nAnon."
