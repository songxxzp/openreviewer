They then gather results with a range of standard DRL methods on the Atari 100k benchmark to show their findings extend empirically to current research on DRL."

The particular instances of these assumptions here happened to be regarding, as can be observed from the extensive line of work, the Rainbow algorithm which is distributional reinforcement learning [1,2,3,4,5].

                    "value": "I feel that the result that larger-capacity models require more data to be trained properly is quite evident (although a theoretical proof in the finite horizon MDP setting is appreciated). For instance, I think the paper proposing DER (data-efficient rainbow), which the authors cite, also somewhat acknowledges this fact and consequently tries to improve the sample complexity of rainbow with various tricks to make it perform better in the low-data regime.\n\nI believe the title is too broad and don't clearly reflect the content of the paper. I would strongly suggest the authors to consider changing the title to mention their focus on the low vs high data regime.\n\nI find the presentation a bit confusing in my first read. For instance, Section 2 introduces the infinite horizon case, while Section 3 considers the finite horizon case with slight different assumptions and notations (e.g., stochastic policy vs deterministic policy, discounted vs undiscounted, stationary MDP vs non-stationary,\u2026). See below for some specific examples of issues.\nI would suggest the authors to start Section 3 by emphasizing the difference with Section 2 and mentioning that they follow the framework proposed by Zanette et al., 2020.\n\nPresentation and formalization issues:\nThe formalization of an MDP is a bit strange and not rigorous:\n\\mathcal P is directly defined as a probability distribution over S x A x S.\n\\rho_0 is not defined.\n\\pi(s, a) is not a map from states to actions. Moreover, the notation doesn't fit the mapping \\pi : S \\to \\Delta(A).\nThe expected cumulative discounted rewards R is not very well defined, since s_{t+1} is also a random variable that depends on a_t.\n\nThe notations in (2-5) should be recalled. The definition of Q_\\beta should be checked.\n\nIn Section 3, why the probability kernel \\mathcal P_t depends on t? Same question for \\mathcal R_t. This point was not mentioned in the definition of a finite horizon MDP, just above.\n\nIs the discount factor missing in (6)? If not, it may be worthwhile to clearly specify that in the finite horizon case, the total reward criterion is used to avoid any confusion for the reader.\n\nAbove (8): Notation \\theta_t \\in d_t is incorrect.\n\nRegarding \\mathcal Q_t(\\theta_t)(s_t, a_t), why not write it as \\mathcal Q_t(s_t, a_t; \\theta_t) like in Section 2?\n\nThe definition of the intrinsic Bellman error should be recalled.\n\nTop of page 4: Typo: dimesions\n\nThe last sentence before Section 4 is too broad in my opinion. If the algorithms are compared using models with similar capacity, I think the comparison is fair.\n\nPage 7: I find the first paragraph quite hard to understand. First of all, the authors should cite the original reference when mentioning an algorithm for the first time. For instance, DRQ^{ICLR} does not have any reference.\nAgarwal et al., 2021 write \"for DrQ, we used the source-code obtained from the authors\". Does DRQ^{NeurIPS} refers to their DrQ(\\epsilon)?\nAlso, as far as I know DrQ does not use the dueling architecture.\n\nFig. 3 (right) seems not be commented in the text."

There are several papers on tuning Rainbow alone (van Hasselt 2019 with DER, Kielak 2019 with OTR, more recently Schmidt et al) that make this exact point, that various data constraints will require essentially different algorithms.\u201d*\n\nWe would like to kindly highlight that you are **incorrect** on the description of the prior work which we also already cite in our paper [1,2,3]. These studies demonstrate that one cannot use the exact same hyperparameters that are tuned for the 200 million frame training in 100K, and if the hyperparameters are specifically tuned these papers state that the best performing algorithm in the high data regime will be again best performing in the low data regime.\n\nOn the other hand, our paper demonstrates that even when hyperparameters are specifically tuned for the data regime one should not and cannot expect the performance profile of an algorithm to monotonically transfer from the high data regime to the low-data regime and vice versa. \n\n\n[1] When to use parametric models in reinforcement learning? NeurIPS 2019.\n\n[2] Do recent advancements in model-based deep reinforcement learning really improve data efficiency? CoRR, 2019.\n\n[3] Dominik Schmidt and Thomas Schmied. Fast and Data-Efficient Training of Rainbow: an Experimental Study on Atari\n\n---\n\n**2.** *\u201cIncluding SPR or any of its variations would invalidate the empirical observation claimed in this paper that in the low-data regime \"the performance profile of the simple base algorithm dueling (sic) is significantly better than any other algorithm that learns the state-action value distribution\" or, elsewhere, \"the simple base algorithm dueling (sic) performs significantly better than any algorithm that focuses on learning the distribution\".\u201d*\n\nWe believe you have some confusion here. The SPR algorithm simply uses a temporally self-predictive model to predict future state representations on top of the Rainbow algorithm. Thus, in SPR the rainbow algorithm here simply can be replaced by a dueling algorithm, or in other words SPR paper could have been built on top of the dueling algorithm instead of Rainbow. Just as in the other studies that we discuss in our paper, SPR is also built on top of the Rainbow algorithm, because again as we discussed in our paper Rainbow was the best performing algorithm at the time. Again in this paper **we see no ablation study** on the algorithm choice (i.e. what SPR is built on). The question here again is what would have happened if the SPR paper did not implicitly assume that, since Rainbow is the best performing algorithm in the high-data regime then it must be in the low-data regime as well, and conducted ablation studies on the algorithm choice, or instead even simply used the dueling algorithm? \n\nThus, the SPR case is also another instance of these exact implicit assumptions that appears in many recent works that our paper highlights, discusses and provides a deep concrete explicit analysis for.\n\n\nSPR: Max Schwarzer, Ankesh Anand, Rishab Goel, R. Devon Hjelm, Aaron C. Courville, Philip Bachman. Data-Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Self-Predictive Representations. ICLR 2021.\n\n---\n\n**3.** *\u201dIt provides a theoretical argument for why larger capacity models can underperform in a low-data regime (compared to low capacity models) which I found sound as much as I could follow it but which I also find limiting since it only concerns linear value function approximation and, in some respects, it's empirically rendered vacuous by recent work, such as Schwarzer 2023.\u201d*\n\nPlease note that the algorithm proposed in Schwarzer et al. (2023) [1] is also SPR on top of Rainbow. Hence, this paper is also making the exact same faulty assumption that our paper describes, discusses and provides a deep concrete explicit analysis for.\n\nFurthermore, note that the faulty implicit assumptions and underlying premises still **persistently** appear in a large body of work even in a more recent conference which will be conducted in December 2023, i.e. NeurIPS 2023 [2].    \n\nIt is evident that learning a distribution is harder than learning the mean, yet there is an entire research line making this mistake systematically as discussed above and in our paper. Thus, explaining explicitly and tediously might be justified in this case to provide insight why these mistakes will lead to systematic faulty decisions in algorithm design.\n\n[1] Max Schwarzer, Johan Obando-Ceron, Aaron Courville, Marc G.

                        "value": "Thank you for your answers.\n\n---\n\n**1.** I agree, strictly speaking [1,2,3] don't argue that relative rankings of methods developed for one data regime necessarily don't hold for other data regimes.\n\nThey do show that large gaps in performance can be closed by careful tuning and interventions on the base implementation that eventually leads to a different algorithm. For example, in order to reach the performance of SimPLE authors of [2] tune the dopamine version of Rainbow which does not have dueling, noisy nets or over-estimation correction. **Sure, it's Rainbow in the name but it's hardly the same algorithm**. What this prior work implied for me was that you will need to tweak algorithms developed in the large data regime to an extent large enough that you shouldn't expect relative rankings to be preserved.\n\nI also don't believe those papers argued that relative rankings are preserved as you said in your response: \"_and if the hyperparameters are specifically tuned these papers state that the best performing algorithm in the high data regime will be again best performing in the low data regime_\", but only that you can tweak and tune them to make them efficient enough for whatever bar you set yourself.\n\nAt this point I'm not sure to what degree the assumption of monotonic performance profiles is real in the literature or more of a forced premise so I'm willing to change my score slightly and acknowledge your reading of the prior work.\n\n---\n\n**2.** You have at least two claims in your paper that suggest that the algorithm you propose will dominate **any** algorithm with a distributional objective in the low-data regime:\n- \"_the performance profile of the simple base algorithm dueling (sic) is significantly better than **any** other algorithm that learns the state-action value distribution_\"\n- \"_the simple base algorithm dueling (sic) performs significantly better than **any** algorithm that focuses on learning the distribution_\"\n\nTherefore I pointed out to one of the current sota methods which uses a categorical objective which would invalidate the **any** in your claims. I then proceeded in the questions section to suggest that if you want to show that indeed this is the case then you need to go to the sota distributional method on Atari100k and ablate it while tuning both algorithms.\n\nIf the aim instead is to show that **one specific** algorithm with a distributional objective will be dominated by its non-distributional counter-part then this has to be done by tuning both algorithms and showing the performance profiles across hyperparameters and not on a fixed, predetermined set that might favor one or another accidentally.\n\n---\n\n**3.** The reason I cited Schwarzer is because it demonstrates that **larger models perform better** in the low data regime which goes against the insights from your theoretical analyses. Maybe they are wrong to use Rainbow but I don't think it has any bearing on this specific point."
