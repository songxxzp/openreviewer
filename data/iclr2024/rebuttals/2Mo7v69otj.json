We answer all questions below. \n\n**Though it is novel and interesting to introduce category theory to this problem, I am not sure if it is really necessary to do so. As far as I understand and please correct me if I am wrong, there are no additional theoretical novelties other than quoting existing definitions to the paper.**\n\nYes, this paper does not derive new results in Category Theory. Instead, as noted in the other reviews and this one, the goal is to deploy ideas from Category Theory to an interesting scientific problem, and show that various models already popular in the community emerge naturally with this framing. Given the limited practical use of category theory for any problem in machine learning, the formalization in this language is a key message of the paper. To make the paper self-contained and easy to read, the definitions were included because they make the discussion precise, and it is then easy to check that the formulation follows from those definitions.\n\n**In terms of the scanner parameter discussed in the experiments, it is also very common to apply different kinds of normalization tricks to resolve the issue. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see relevant discussion or experiments in the paper.**\n\nYes, this is correct. If a scanner is the only variable we must control for, some scale/location normalization as a pre-processing step may be a good first step to adjust global intensity changes. We included these works in the revised version of our discussion. The already discussed solutions describe how mutual information and discrepancy-based losses are more effective and improve performance. It is not clear how to pool while handling the multiple covariate case with a single normalization.\n\nPlease let us know if we can answer any other questions."

The motivation is to find commonality among datasets in terms of the latent space and aid in data pooling / data harmonisation, something that is needed when data collection is expensive and data from multiple sources need to be combined.  The hope is that the theory is able to define structure and invariances/equivariances between them,, and invariance to shifts in feature distributions for clinical and demographic features when dealing with image data would be easily drawn. For quantifying  the shift, minimum distance and cosine sim are employed. The paper also describes a reinterpretaion of two differentiable models from adversarial and self-supervised learning families, and walks through a demonstration of latent space operation sequences on MNIST before developing notions of losses and evaluations on data. It reads almost like a position paper with few evaluations."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, \n\nThank you for the comments and questions. We provide detailed answers below,\n\n\n**Both classes of Functor mappings are linear or affine, given properties of identity, distributivity and commutativity.**\n\nWe have indeed experimented with richer mappings, both for the Functor as well as for the morphisms. They work well. If recommended, we are happy to include the results in the Appendix. In the paper, linear/affine was chosen only to avoid detracting from the formulation, i.e., which benefits (say, in Fig. 3) were intrinsic to the formulation presented and is not attributable to the richness of modules being used for the Functor/Morphism classes.\n\nWe should note the axioms/rules that we can read off from the diagram in Fig. 4 are otherwise not restrictive and can also be implemented via MLPs (or convolutional layers), e.g., as is already common in CycleGAN or SimCLR.  \n\n**While converting to measurable spaces, does the scale of the Borel interval have an effect? That\u2019s something that may merit digging into.**\n\nWhile some of our experiments report distances, our current construction does not construct a normalized measure on the latent space. We agree that doing so can allow saying more about the latent space structure learned by the category theoretic construction, similar to groups. We definitely plan to study these interesting extensions.  \n\n**When evaluating, accuracy seems just an indicator and not really a measure of distributional discrepancy like mmd and adv. Do I understand it right?**\n\nYes, we report the discrepancy measures in Table 2 but included accuracy as an evaluation criterion simply to check that the representation still retains enough signal to yield good performance for the regression/classification task at hand. We welcome suggestions on including any other relevant measures. Thank you. \n\nWe appreciate the questions and the observations. Please let us know if we have satisfactorily answered the questions."

Images are mapped to a latent space\n- using AE but I guess this can be other things - and covariate shifts\nare modeled as transformations in the latent space. Invariance to\nsome covariate shifts, e.g., using different acquisition devices, are\nmodeled by enforcing similar latent space\nrepresentations. Equivariance is obtained by enforcing a chosen\ntransformation. Experimens show that the resulting model can retain\naccuracy while removing differences between samples with covariate\nshift in the latent space in cases where invariance is\ndesired. When equivariance is desired, authors show that the latent\nspace transformations are also good."

This has the\n   potential of inventing new directions for data pooling and\n   addressing covariate shifts.\n2. Authors provide a great introduction to the theory and maps the\n   relevant aspects to practical problems pertinent to covariate\n   shifts observed in application in neuroimaging.\n3. Experimental results are motivating. Authors compare with some\n   recent work to convince us that the model proposed is indeed\n   useful.\n4. The article is not necessarily providing a novel technique but\n   rather discusses a theory that views already applied methods as a\n   special case and thus allows further generalization. For instance,\n   https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16431-6_1\n   applied similar ideas for longitudinal imaging data."

                    "value": "1. The current method requires overlapping covariate values between\n   data sets coming from different centers. Equation (9) seems crucial\n   for the methods to work. However, until (9) the reader is left with\n   the opinion that Category Theory would magically work for\n   non-overlapping covariate values between different data sets. This\n   should be clearly discussed early on in the article to avoid any\n   confusions and - to be honest - false hope. Given two data sets\n   whose covariate values do not overlap, the current method may not\n   work at all. \n2. The emphasis on couterfactuals is rather questionable. There is no\n   decoupling of the effects of different covariates on data. In other\n   words, a transformation in the latent space may correspond to\n   changes in multiple covariates. A well curated data set may avoid\n   this problem, however, generally this will not hold. Therefore, it\n   is difficult to discuss about counterfactuals and even\n   interventions. The latent space transformations will not be able to\n   account a missing causal model linking covariates, observed\n   images and labels. I recommend authors to reconsider claims\n   regarding counterfactuals.\n3. Figure 5 is not explained at all. This seems like an important\n   figure and requires further explanation in the text.\n4. I find the claim that this approach simplifies recent\n   works in the literature not substantiated. Furthermore, without\n   explicit disentanglement nor the capability to do interventions, I\n   am not sure to what authors may be referring."

Your comments have helped us refine the paper\u2019s message in the revised version we uploaded. We are grateful to see appreciation of the main formulation, and answer all questions below.\n\n**The current method requires overlapping covariate values between data sets coming from different centers.** \n\nWe are sorry that the text does not make this explicit. We have now modified it so that there is no confusion. We assumed that Figure 1 would convey the setup accurately but we have now annotated it more. The figure shows three covariates: they do not match exactly but do have a shared interval. The problem setup is also described in the introduction (middle of page 2). We note that we deal with \u201c**some** shift/disbalance in covariates across sites (participant data including age, sex and so on, which influence the scans)\u201d. But yes, to avoid any confusion, we made the text much more explicit. Thank you for pointing this out. \n\nWe agree that if there is no overlap between the covariates, then there is no coupling to work with, and it is not clear how to write down a sensible formulation. \n\n**The emphasis on counterfactuals is rather questionable**\n\nYes, we agree completely. The use of the term counterfactuals was simply to draw an analogy between our \u201cwhat if\u201d experiment to a topic being actively studied by many in the community. We value the constructive nature of this comment. We have removed this terminology to avoid any confusion. Thanks.\n\n**Figure 5 is not explained at all. This seems like an important figure and requires further explanation in the text.**\n\nWe included an explanation of Figure 5 at the bottom of page 8. But based on the suggestion, we have expanded the passage with more information and intuition about the figure. Roughly, the idea is that if the model has learned a meaningful structure, then when applying a morphism that increases the covariate pertaining to a risk factor, the new vector should be much closer to the diseased group (high cosine similarity and/or smaller distance). \n\n**I find the claim that this approach simplifies recent works in the literature not substantiated.**\n\nA recent baseline (see Table 1) uses a multi-stage pipeline for training, and handles one continuous and one categorical covariate. We hope that the reviewer agrees that Alg. 1 is much more concise and simple, and is suggested directly by the category-theoretic casting of the problem. We agree that disentanglement or mutual information-based terms as in Moyer et al (references on top of page 13) can be added to our model. \n\n\nWe appreciate the suggestions, particularly regarding counterfactuals and have updated the paper. Please let us know if we have satisfactorily answered the questions."
