The method utilizes a co-training framework inspired by CPS [1] to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled images. To address the issue of rapid convergence between the two models within the co-training framework, the author introduces Complementary Channel-Wise Feature Dropout, which is applied to the output features of an encoder. Additionally, the author introduces a modified form of the CutMix augmentation method called Complementary Spatial-Wise CutMix.\n\n[1]Xiaokang Chen, Yuhui Yuan, Gang Zeng, and Jingdong Wang.

Also, the proposed modified cut-mix algorithm seems to be a simple variant version of the original one.\n\nSo hereby the reviewer considers that this work is not enough for its novelty aspect.\n\n[1]Y.

To this end, the authors propose *complementary* feature and input augmentation techniques to produce disjoint views of a pair of input images. Specifically, to achieve this goal, the authors propose randomly decomposing the feature maps along the channel dimension and switching the \"copy\" and the \"paste\" roles in CutMix. Empirical evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                    "value": "**Major concerns**\n\n1. **The value of studying semi-supervised semantic segmentation.** As the Segment Anything Model [A] has been proposed and the SA-1B dataset has been made publicly available to the community, I doubt the value of this setting. The authors may argue that SAM cannot produce high-quality *semantic* masks, but several works, e.g., [B] and [C], have demonstrated that simple adaption is enough to make SAM a semantic segmentation model.\n\n2. **The core insight has not been well ablated.** The core insight of this paper is \"the success of co-training heavily relies on the discrepancy of peer models\". However, except for Figure 1c, there is no other evidence to support this claim. It is better to evaluate the disagreement ratio at least for all ablations (Tables 6-8 and Figure 3). Evaluating the disagreement ratio for other methods (Tables 1-5) is also encouraged. It is strongly recommended to plot a figure that shows a strong coherence between the disagreement ratio and the mIoU.\n\n3. **Insignificant improvements over UniMatch considering the extra computational cost.** From Table 1 and Table 2, the performance of CT++ is similar to UniMatch and the improvements are not significant. Although the improvements seem to be a little bit more significant in Table 4 and Table 5, the computational cost of CT++ is approximately 2x that of UniMatch. It is recommended to compare the number of parameters, FLOPs, training time, and GPU memory between CT++ and other self-training frameworks.\n\n4. **The EMA teacher has not been ablated.** The improvements of CT++ over CPS might come from two extra EMA teachers.\n\n\n\n**Minor questions/suggestions**\n\n5. The computation of the disagreement ratio in Figure 1c needs clarifying.\n\n6. Simply repeating the dropped feature twice as described in Eq. (5) may contribute to discrepancies between training and testing. How about replacing those masked feature channels with a learnable mask token?\n\n7. Is the encoder for extracting F1 and F2 kept frozen?\n\n8. It is better to list all methods in Table 1 (CPS and U2PL are missing), although CT++ performs better than those methods.\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n[A] A. Kirillov et al.

                    "value": "This article works on the problem of semi-supervised semantic segmentation. It follows the co-training paradigm, but introduces several techniques (e.g., channel-wise dropout, spatial-wise cutout) to enlarge the discrepancy between co-training models. The model is verified on standard benchmarks."

                    "value": "My major concerns are on contributions, motivations and performance.\n\nThe contributions of the article appear to be quite incremental over CPS. The proposed techniques are more like tricks rather than contributions. For example, I will not buy that Sec. 3.3 is a major contribution. \n\nFor motivation, while the point of model discrepancy somewhat makes sense to me, I am confusing whether larger discrepancy indicates better performance. All the techniques in the paper are designed to enhance the differences between models, but to what extent we can do this. The submission lacks proper discussions regarding this aspect. \n\nFor performance, it seems from Fig. 4 that ColorAug affects a lot on performance. For example, for the case of 92 samples, we see an increase of ~4% mIoU. This raised an issue about the effectiveness of the method, does the performance improvement come from the proposed components, or the ColorAug trick?"
