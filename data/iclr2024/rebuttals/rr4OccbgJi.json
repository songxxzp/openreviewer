                    "value": "Learning-based 3D shape generation approaches, including auto-encoder, tend to generate 3D shapes with defects, i.e., shapes with holes and/or clusters, which is caused by inequal density distribution of points across the shape surface. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposed a Lennard-Jones layer (LJL) to equalize the density across the distribution of 2D and 3D point clouds while still keeping the overall shape structure. This process is termed as $\\textit{distribution normalization}$.  Be more specific, Lennard-Jones potential is first computed for each pair of nearest points within a point cloud and each point is either pulled or pushed by the gradient of the potential as forces. \n\nIn addition to a toy example on 2D Euclidean plane, the proposed LJL is evaluated on auto-encoder-based generative model and DDPM-based generative model. The $\\textit{Distance Score}$ proposed in this paper is used to evaluate the point distribution increase by a large margin when integrating LJL into the above two generative models, while the generation results are slightly affected\u3002"

                    "value": "1. $\\textbf{Motivation}$\n\n1.1 One concern is to what extend we need to redistribute points in generated point clouds? Holes and clusters indeed exist in the generated point clouds, but does this problem is severe enough? Some down-streaming or related tasks or applications which are severe affected by the inequal distribution of points are needed to strength the motivation of the paper.\n\n1.2 If we generate more points for shapes and then uniformly downsample again, will the issue of holes and clusters be alleviated? This is related with the significance of the paper.\n\n2. $\\textbf{Method}$\n\n2.1 According to Figure 3, it seems that the hyperparameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\sigma$ have significant influence on the redistribution result, so it may need case-by-case tuning of $\\epsilon$ and $\\sigma$ to achieve a good performance. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n2.2 From Figure 5 and Figure 7, incorporating LJL could lead to over-smooth shape boundaries (wings and tailplanes in Figure 5) and slightly distortion of shape details (nose in Figure 7). This may be the drawback of the proposed approach. If such a drawback could be corrected, it will strengthen the paper.\n\n3. $\\textbf{Experiments}$\n\n3.1 Some experimental details are missing. For example, how many points are generated per shape in experiments in Section 4.2? Did you retrain ShapeGF, and Lou & Hu's model or used their released pretrained model? Why not use the original evaluation metrics adopted in ShapeGF, and Lou & Hu's paper?\n\n3.2 It is only evaluated on three generative approaches from two categories, e.g., audo-encoding and DDPM, more experiments and evaluations are needed.\n\n4. $\\textbf{Writting}$\n\n4.1 The legend text in Figure 18 is too small to be seen clearly.\n\n3.3 It is preferable to add citations in Table 1 and Table 2 to make it easier to check the reference papers."

                        "value": "1. Motivation:\n\n\nWe see the usefulness of our approach mainly in being able to reduce the number of points (thus increasing efficiency) while still expressing the surface well. For a huge amount of points, the surface is already known with high accuracy and explicit surface resampling can readily be used. However, the same is not true when a few points are used, since the surface to be resampled cannot be reconstructed accurately. As mentioned, we are adding another analysis of this.\n\n2. Avoiding oversmoothing etc.:\n\n\nSince the LJL is task agnostic, it is always applied in the same way. Results with less surface distortion could probably achieved for each of the tasks when doing holistic optimization of this specific task, e.g. by training the network with already optimized distributions.\nIn our work, we motivate the use of equally distributed point clouds and offer a general solution for this that does not require retraining of\nany networks. Improving the results further as stated above is then interesting future work, but outside the focus of this paper."

However, I think it is still questionable whether the method can be generalized to other or more advanced point cloud generation methods beyond ShapeGF and DDPM. If the method is only compatible with these two relatively old methods, the contribution of this method might not be high.\n\n- The irregular distributions of point clouds may carry useful information about the point clouds. Normalizing point cloud distributions may not always be helpful to improve generation results. To balance the irregular structures and normalized distributions, it may need prior knowledge to adjust the hyper-parameters of the proposed method. According to Figure 14, the method seems sensitive to these hyper-parameters. Do you have a systematic/automatic solution to determine these parameters? If it is difficult to determine these parameters or the parameters need to be determined case-by-case, the method may not be able to generalize to various problems. \n\n- Table 1 and 2 only report the relative improvement. Can you provide detailed results? If the proposed method can directly improve the number reported in the original papers, the results will be more convincing."

                        "value": "1. Motivation:\n\n\nThe motivation of distribution normalization is discussed in section 1. In short, we aim to have a higher expressiveness of few points by\navoiding holes and clusters. We agree, that there are scenarios, where a more uniform distribution is not an advantage. Identifying whether or not distribution normalization is an advantage is the users' responsibility, analogous to how outlier removal or sorting of a data set is not always a useful operation\n\n\n2. Scene-level point clouds:\n\n\nOur method operates locally, not globally (in fact, through the nearest neighbor search, the effect of each step is extremely locally limited). Since scenes are composed of individual objects and we sufficiently show individual objects with all kinds of surface features, it automatically follows, that LJL works on whole scenes as well. The local impact could however not be shown in large scenes, which makes the unsuitable for evaluating the effects of LJL. Thus, we did not include them.\n\n3. Efficiency:\n\n\nThe most complex step is the nearest neighbor search, which has a complexity of N*log(N). As long as the depth of the processing network is greater than log(N), the runtime is dominated by the original network, not the LJL. Even if this is not the case, there is no\nexplosion of runtime."

Minimizing the LJ potential can be seen as moving the points so that close-by points are neither too far or too close to each other. This operation can be inserted into certain time steps of a point cloud diffusion model to prevent the final result from forming holes and clusters. The proposed method is benchmarked on 2D through spectral analysis, and 3D via a diffusion autoencoder experiment."

The paper only demonstrates improved point cloud uniformity when used in conjunction with ShapeGF (Cai et al.) and DDPM (Luo et al.). However, these two models are inherently flawed -- they formulate point cloud generation as independent points uniformly distributed on the surface, thus unable to capture the global uniformity. Methods that models joint distribution of points, such as LION (Zheng et al.) and Point-E (Nichol et al.) might already produce uniform point clouds without the proposed method.\n* Evaluation is lacking -- it will be more solid if the proposed method can be benchmarked against state-of-the-art models using standard point cloud generation and reconstruction evaluation metrics on standard datasets, instead of just presenting the percentage increase over a simple baseline.\n* The exposition is sometimes comfusing. For example, it is not clear how the optimal LJL parameters are found using Algorithm 2 -- it shows merely a diffusion autoencoder for point clouds.\n* Minor writting issue: In Algorithm 2, \"autoencoder\" usually refers to an encoder-decoder that is trained to reconstruct the input. In this case, it is better to call \"E_\\theta\" as \"encoder\" instead."

Choice, which models to compare against:\n\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no other approach is specifically optimized to generate uniformly distributed point clouds. This includes LION and Point-E, where the training data does not contain uniform sampling and non-uniform sampling can be observed in the results shown in the paper. Based on the structure, LJL can be included in any iterative process. Our specific choice was motivated by the availability of source code of other methods. Since LJL works the same in every task, there is nothing that would indicate it would not work on a specific network like LION or Point-E.\n\n2. Regarding the last question, blue noise is a type of randomized uniform sampling and we want to sample/generate/denoise point cloud to have this type of property."
