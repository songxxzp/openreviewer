Besides, if the handcrafted prompt is effective, then why bother finding new ones? \n2. Could you evaluate more defenses as mentioned in the paper 'Baseline defenses for adversarial attacks against aligned language models'?\n3. Please revise the Method section and reorganize the paper.

Please provide standard error to determine whether there is indeed an improvement.\n\n**A**: In Tables 1 and 2, the results show that both Vicuna-7b and Guanaco-7b are not very robust (attacks can achieve 97+% ASR on them), leading to the improvement of AutoDan-HGA compared with AutoDAN-GA become implicit. However, in robust LLM like Llama2, AutoDan-HGA has explicit improvement compared with AutoDAN-GA, as the optimization based on this model becomes challenging. Specifically, we share the ablation study Table 5, AutoDan-HGA surpasses AutoDan-GA by 8% in attack effectiveness and also lowers the computational cost.\n\nThe above results are gained from the scalable dataset (AdvBench Behaviour) that can guarantee reliability. In addition, we conducted a study on the standard error, based on the Llama2 and 100 data pairs from the AdvBench Behaviour dataset. The study on AutoDAN involves 5 random runs. The results are as follows:\n\n| Metric | Avg. Keyword ASR (standard error) (improvement) | Avg. Time Cost (standard error) (improvement) | \n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| GCG | 0.44 (no std) (+0%) | 920.0s (no std) (+0%) |\n| AutoDAN-GA| 0.51 (0.006) (+15.9%) | 752.6s (37.622) (-18.2%) |\n| AutoDAN-HGA | 0.584 (0.005) (+32.7%) | 679.6s (36.838) (-26.1%) |\n\nThe above results validate that both methods have improvement compared with GCG, and AutoDAN-HGA has improvement compared with AutoDAN-GA."

Besides, if the handcrafted prompt is effective, then why bother finding new ones? \n\n**A**: Initialization is important for a genetic algorithm. In our paper, we have shared detailed ablation studies on each part of our proposed method, including the role of handcrafted prompts and the role of optimization based on these prototypes.\n\nIn our paper, we argue that existing handcrafted prompts, although only effective on a few specific samples (as when they are shared on the Internet), can still serve as initializations for further optimization. This is verified based on our evaluation results. Firstly, from Tables 1 and 5, we can see that the handcrafted prompt only has poor ASR on different LLMs. Secondly, from Table 5, we can see that if the AutoDAN is not initialized by a handcrafted prototype jailbreak prompt, and uses a background story as its prompt (i.e., has no jailbreak effectiveness), the ASR will degrade from 0.4154 to 0.2731 on Llama2, which is about 34.3%, and the computation cost will rise about 10%. \n\nIn summary, using handcrafted jailbreak prompts can benefit the proposed method by setting a good initialization, and enhancing both attack strength and convergence speed, although the handcrafted jailbreak prompts may be not effective in scalable data. On the other hand, as we show in Table 1, AutoDAN\u2019s optimization process enhances the attack effectiveness of the prototype prompt (i.e., take this prompt as the initial prompt and conduct optimization) by about 25 times on Llama2-7b-chat, 3 times on Vicuna-7b and Guanaco-7b."

These defenses are implemented based on the paper\u2019s description and safeguard a Vicuna-7b model. For paraphrasing, we use OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5.-turbo-0301 as the paraphraser. For adversarial training, we set mixing=0.2, epochs=3. We test the attack effectiveness of GCG attack and AutoDAN-HGA on 100 data pairs from the AdvBench Behavior dataset. The results are as follows:\n\n| Keyword ASR | Vicuna | Vicuna+paraphrasing | Vicuna+adversarial training |\n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| GCG | 0.97 | 0.06 | 0.94 |\n| AutoDAN-HGA | 0.97 | 0.68 | 0.93 |\n\nA major difference is the performance of both attacks when facing the paraphrasing defense, where GCG becomes invalid, but AutoDAN retains its effectiveness on many samples. We take a further investigation and find that the paraphrasing usually \u201cdiscards\u201d the GCG\u2019s suffixes as they are usually garbled characters. However, the jailbreak prompts generated by AutoDAN maintain their meaning after paraphrasing, as they inherently are meaningful texts."

To address the scalability issue from manual prompt design, and the stealthiness issue from token-based algorithm and semantically meaningless prompt, the authors propose AutoDAN that is capable of automatically generating stealthy jailbreak prompts. This is achieved by a hierarchical genetic algorithm. The proposed method can preserve the stealthiness of jailbreak prompts and bypass perplexity detection. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of cross-modal transferability and cross-sample universality."

As per Table 3, DAN initialization and LLM-based Mutation have higher impacts on performance. For the LLM-base Mutation, this brings additional computation. Moreover, outputs from Alg.4 could be random without any pattern so it is not straightforward and detailed to see how the diverse initializations influence the performance. It would be better if the authors could provide some insights on it. \n\n3. I also have concerns about the defense evaluation in Table 3. What is the threshold used in this evaluation? This is important because there still seems to be a small gap of PPL values between the handcrafted and automatic DANs. Does that mean if the threshold is set to be a proper value, the perplexity-based method [1] still has the chance to make successful defenses? \n\n4. For the experiments of cross-model transferability in Table 2, I have concerns about the low transferability of prompts optimized on Vicuna using GCG while Table 2 of [2] shows they can achieve ASR over 30% on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using Behavior+GCG optimized on Vicuna. It would be better to see the comparison between AutoDAN-HGA with GCG on GPT-3.5 or GPT-4.  \n\n5. The proposed method still takes a long time to optimize for one sample.  \n\n\n[1] Jain, N., Schwarzschild, A., Wen, Y., Somepalli, G., Kirchenbauer, J., Chiang, P. Y., ... & Goldstein, T. (2023).

In this case, all words in one sentence have the same score. Why can the sentence-level score represent the word score? Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.\n\n**A**: Yes, the words in one sample will be labeled with the same score. However, as there exist multiple samples in each iteration, the words will be labeled the average score based on the scores of the samples in which they exist, thus leading to different scores for words in one sentence (as the words may also exist in other different samples). For example, if AutoDAN has 64 samples per iteration, and the word \u201cuse\u201d exists in 48 samples, then, the score of \u201cuse\u201d in this iteration will be the average score over the scores of these 48 samples, noted S_1. If the previous iteration also memorizes the score of \u201cuse\u201d, noted as S_2, then the final score of \u201cuse\u201d in this iteration will be (S_1+S_2)/2."

For the LLM-base Mutation, this brings additional computation.\n\n**A**: The mutation mechanism is critical for genetic algorithms, as it diversifies the searching space for the algorithm and enables effective optimization. The LLM-based mutation proposed in our method, whose computation efficiency relied on the response speed of the LLMs, was not conducted frequently in our method. As claimed in Appendix D.2, the mutation probability is 0.01, which means that every sample in the algorithm only has a 1% probability to have an LLM-base mutation.\n\nWe also show the computational cost in the ablation study (Table 5), which shows that the algorithm is even 5% faster when conducting LLM-based mutation (722.6s v.s. 766.6s). This is because, as we mentioned above, the LLM-base mutation diversifies the searching space for the algorithm, making the algorithm achieve the success prompt earlier to trigger the termination criteria (described in 3.5). As for the effectiveness of attack, the LLM-based mutation introduces about 35% improvement as shown in Table 5. In summary, we believe the LLM-based mutation does introduce improvement for our method. However, we notice that there may exist a better mutation policy that can be further explored in future works.\n\n**Q**: Moreover, outputs from Alg.4 could be random without any pattern so it is not straightforward and detailed to see how the diverse initializations influence the performance. It would be better if the authors could provide some insights on it. \n\n**A**: For the effectiveness of the diverse initializations, we conducted an additional experiment with 100 data pairs from AdvBench Behaviour. In this experiment, we use AutoDAN-GA as the baseline and replace the LLM-based diverse initializations with a synonym replacement according to Wordnet. The synonym replacement is conducted in a probability=10% for every word in the prototype prompt, randomly picking a word from its synonyms. The results on Llama2 are as follows:\n\n| Metric | AutoDAN-GA w LLM-based diverse initializations | AutoDAN-GA w wordnet synonym replacement  | \n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | \n| ASR | 0.51 | 0.33 |\n\nThe results show that using an LLM to diversify the prompts surpasses naive synonym replacement. We take further case studies and find that the LLM-based diversification is often more reasonable and fluent. We believe this benefits from the outstanding power of the in-context understanding of the LLMs. We have added this ablation study to our revised paper in Appendix I."

                        "value": "**Q**: I also have concerns about the defense evaluation in Table 3. What is the threshold used in this evaluation? This is important because there still seems to be a small gap of PPL values between the handcrafted and automatic DANs. Does that mean if the threshold is set to be a proper value, the perplexity-based method [1] still has the chance to make successful defenses? \n\n**A**: In Table 3, we calculated the threshold by testing the AdvBench behavior dataset in the victim model and set the highest PPL as the threshold, which is aligned with [1]. This process can ensure that no original malicious request will trigger the PPL detection. In this setting, the AutoDAN has not triggered the PPL detection, indicating that AutoDAN is indistinguishable from natural input. \n\nNotably, in Table 1, we also share the PPL calculated by another GPT-2-medium model. According to GPT-2\u2019s paper [2], the One Billion Word Benchmark\u2019s [3] PPL calculated by GPT-2-medium is 55.72, which is very close to the worst PPL of our method (AutoDAN-HGA in Llama2). In summary, as the jailbreak prompt generated by AutoDAN assembles the natural input, it will be hard (even impossible) to find a threshold that leads to a consistent false positive rate.\n\n[1] Jain, N., Schwarzschild, A., Wen, Y., Somepalli, G., Kirchenbauer, J., Chiang, P.

                        "value": "**Q**: For the experiments of cross-model transferability in Table 2, I have concerns about the low transferability of prompts optimized on Vicuna using GCG while Table 2 of [2] shows they can achieve ASR over 30% on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using Behavior+GCG optimized on Vicuna.\n\n**A**: The reasons are:\n\n1. The API call is protected by additional content filters (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter), which is \u201daimed at detecting jailbreak risk and known content for text and code\u201d, thus leading to response rejection when we try to jailbreak the APIs. We are not sure if this kind of filter was deployed by OpenAI or Azure when GCG\u2019s paper conducted the evaluations, and how these filters evolved during this period, causing difficulties in reproducing the results.\n\n2. For cross-model transferability on the open-source LLMs, in our experiments, we test both GCG and our method in a (1 prompt, 1 model) setting (GCG test in (25 prompts, 2 models) setting), leaving the transferability enhancement schemes behind. We chose this setting since it is affordable for our computational resources, and it can reveal the inherent transferability of the attacks. Also, as the transferability enhancement schemes are orthogonal to our method, the proposed AutoDAN has no restrictions on merging with such schemes.\n\n\n**Q**:  It would be better to see the comparison between AutoDAN-HGA with GCG on GPT-3.5 or GPT-4. \n\n**A**: In our paper, we have shown the results on GPT-3.5 for both AutoDAN and GCG, with **detailed ablation studies**. For GPT-4, In [1], they evaluated their model on the GPT-4-0313 checkpoint. However, we do not have open access for this checkpoint due to Azure\u2019s policy. Instead, we conducted experiments on two OpenAI\u2019s GPT models: GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 and GPT-4-0613. We shared the results on GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 in our paper Table 5.    \n\nThe detailed results on GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 and GPT-4-0613 are as follows:\n\n| Keywords ASR |GCG | AutoDAN-GA | AutoDAN-HGA |\n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | \n| GPT-3.5-turbo-0301(transfer from Vicuna) | 0.0730 | 0.5904 | 0.7077 |\n| GPT-3.5-turbo-0301(transfer from Llama2)  | 0.1654 | 0.6192 | 0.6577 |\n| GPT-4-0613 (transfer from Llama2) | 0.0004 | 0.0096 | 0.0077 |\n\nWe can observe that although the attack success rate of our method is better than the baseline GCG in both OpenAI\u2019s models, the GPT4-0613 model indeed achieves high robustness against the black-box jailbreak examples (both for GCG and our method). To summarize, our proposed method transfers well to the March version of GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses the baseline GCG by a large margin, but has low transferability on the latest GPT-4, like the baseline GCG. Here, we want to highlight that although we show the proposed method has higher transferability in Tables 2 and 5, the main goal of this paper is still performing the **white-box red-teaming with meaningful prompts** to assess the reliability of LLMs\u2019 safety features, instead of improving the transferability of the generated jailbreak prompts. \n\nIn the adversarial domain, improving the transferability of the generated adversarial examples is also an important research topic, which needs non-trivial efforts. Additionally, as the APIs have additional safeguard mechanisms such as content filtering (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter), and advanced alignment methods are being conducted continually, we believe attacking such black-box APIs needs systematic efforts to ensure their effectiveness and reproducibility. Attacking the most cutting-edge APIs like the latest GPT-4 will be our future work. \n\n[1] Zou, A., Wang, Z., Kolter, J. Z., & Fredrikson, M. (2023).

When both have an early stop criteria (i.e., check if the attack is successful and end the optimization if it is True), our method can surpass the baseline (GCG attack) in computational cost of about 22.4%. This is because our method does not need to backward the loss function, although our method is a form of genetic algorithm that is believed to be slower than other kinds of optimization algorithms. \n\nIn summary, we should admit that there remain places in future works to further reduce the computational cost of jailbreak methods like the proposed AutoDAN. However, we believe the proposed method has accomplished its main goal, i.e., generating semantic-preserving jailbreak prompts, meanwhile having a better computational cost compared with the baseline."

However, in this paper, we argue that, since there exist many handcrafted jailbreak prompts found by the community (more than automatic methods), we can utilize them as excellent initial samples. So, finding a qualified prototype prompt is not hard. We also conduct experiments to evaluate AutoDAN under different prototype prompts. We select additional three types of prototype prompts (named AIM, SDA, UCAR) from https://www.jailbreakchat.com. Due to the time limitation, we randomly select 100 data pairs from AdvBench and select the LLama2 as our targeted attack model. The results are as follows:\n\n| Prototypes | Dev Mode ( it used in our original paper) | AIM | SDA | UCAR |\n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | \n| ASR before AutoDAN\u2019s optimization | 0.02 | 0.02 | 0.01 | 0.02 |\n| ASR after AutoDAN\u2019s optimization | 0.51 | 0.45 | 0.49 | 0.56 |\n\nWe can observe that none of the prototype jailbreak prompts can achieve an ASR higher than 0.02 before being optimized by AutoDAN. From the results, we can draw the conclusion that the optimization process of AutoDAN matters: AutoDAN  can improve all attack effectiveness by a large margin regardless of the prototype jailbreak prompt.\n\n**Q**: It\u2019s also unclear to me how the choices of prototype prompts relate to the handcrafted DAN baseline. \n\n**A**: In our experiments, the handcrafted DAN baseline is equal to the prototype prompt, which is utilized in the initialization of AutoDAN-GA and AutoDAN-HGA."

                        "value": "**Q**: I\u2019m also concerned about the usage of the \u201cRecheck\u201d metric. While the metric is interesting and answers an important question (i.e. is the model actually answering the query), it\u2019s unclear how well the metric itself performs (seems to be dependent on the abilities of the evaluating LLM?). I believe the paper would be stronger if examples and  further study of the recheck metric (e.g. under different evaluators) could be provided.\n\n**A**: Thank you for acknowledging our evaluation design. In our experiments, we specifically employed GPT-4-0613 as the base model for the Recheck metric and also as the base model for LLM-based Diversification. \n\nWe conducted two additional experiments about the Recheck metric. **Firstly, we aim to investigate to what extent our Recheck metric aligns with human judgment.** For this study, we take the jailbreak responses to the first 50 malicious requests in the AdvBench behavior dataset, gained by the GCG attack on Llama2. We involve 5 different LLMs to serve as the base model of the Recheck metric. These models include popular open-sourced aligned models (Llama-2-13B, Vicuna-33B), commercial APIs (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, we use their 0613 version), and an uncensored model (Wizard-Vicuna-30B, representing the Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored-fp16 model). Additionally, we also involve the \"Keywords\" metric, which represents the original keyword-checking approach discussed in GCG's and our paper.\n\nNotably, when we test on GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4, as these LLM services have a content detection mechanism that will refuse to provide a response when input/output is detected as harmful (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter), we view the jailbreak as success when the prompt triggers this mechanism, as it represents the response provided by the victim LLM does have something malicious.\n\nWe also conducted a user study with 5 participants, who are asked to assess whether the response provided by the victim LLM is actually answering the corresponding malicious requests. The final outcome of this study was determined through majority voting based on the responses from these five participants.\n\nThe results are as follows:\n\n| Base Models | Keywords | Llama-2-13B | Vicuna-33B | GPT-3.5-turbo | GPT-4 | Wizard-Vicuna-30B | Human | \n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| Keywords | 1.0 | 0.72 | 0.64 | 0.16 | 0.7 | 0.66 | 0.76 |\n| Llama-2-13B | - | 1.0 | 0.6 | 0.28 |  0.54 | 0.5 | 0.56 |\n| Vicuna-33B | - | - | 1.0 | 0.36 | 0.66 | 0.58 | 0.76 |\n| GPT-3.5-turbo | - | - | - | 1.0 | 0.26 | 0.3 | 0.24 |\n| GPT-4 | - | - | - | - | 1.0 | 0.76 | 0.9 |\n| Wizard-Vicuna-30B | - | - | - | - | - | 1.0 | 0.74 |\n| Human | - | - | - | - | - | - | 1.0 |\n\n*Table.1 The decision overlapping across different base models and keyword detection*\n\nGPT-4 demonstrates a high overlap with human judgment (0.9), suggesting its efficacy as a reliable verifier for responses provided by victim LLMs. This similarity to human evaluation implies that GPT-4 can accurately assess the appropriateness of responses. \n\n**Secondly, we want to investigate how the metric performs across various LLMs.** The experiment settings are equal to Table 1. And the results are as follows:\n\n| Metric\u2193 Base Model\u2192 | Keywords | Llama-2-13B | Vicuna-33B | GPT-3.5-turbo | GPT-4 | Wizard-Vicuna-30B | Human | \n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: |\n| Recheck ASR | 0.14 | 0.34 | 0.22 | 0.74 | 0.24 | 0.36 | 0.14 |\n\n*Table.2 The keywords detection ASR and Recheck ASR*\n\nThe findings indicate that while keyword detection aligns with human evaluations in terms of accuracy, the overlap is not complete (with a ratio of 0.76). This partial alignment is consistent with our observations that sometimes LLMs respond to malicious requests with a direct answer followed by a disclaimer like \u201cHowever, this is illegal\u201d or \u201cI do not support this action\u201d. Such responses trigger keyword detection, but realistically, they should be categorized as successful attacks. Conversely, there are instances where LLM responses, though not outright refusals, are nonsensical and should be classified as attack failures."

                        "value": "**Q**: Was the method tried on GPT-4?\n\n**A**: Thank you for your great question. In our paper, we follow the standard experimental setting of victim models in [1], which is the baseline of our method, for fair comparison. In [1], they evaluated their model on the GPT-4-0313 checkpoint. However, we do not have open access for this checkpoint due to Azure\u2019s policy. Instead, we conducted experiments on two OpenAI\u2019s GPT models: GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 and GPT-4-0613. We shared the results on GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 in our paper Table 5.    \n\nThe detailed results on GPT-3.5-turbo-0301 and GPT-4-0613 are as follows:\n\n| Keywords ASR |GCG | AutoDAN-GA | AutoDAN-HGA |\n| :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | :-------: | \n| GPT-3.5-turbo-0301(transfer from Vicuna) | 0.0730 | 0.5904 | 0.7077 |\n| GPT-3.5-turbo-0301(transfer from Llama2)  | 0.1654 | 0.6192 | 0.6577 |\n| GPT-4-0613 (transfer from Llama2) | 0.0004 | 0.0096 | 0.0077 |\n\nWe can observe that although the attack success rate of our method is better than the baseline GCG in both OpenAI\u2019s models, the GPT4-0613 model indeed achieves high robustness against the black-box jailbreak examples (both for GCG and our method). To summarize, our proposed method transfers well to the March version of GPT-3.5-turbo and surpasses the baseline GCG by a large margin, but has low transferability on the latest GPT-4, like the baseline GCG. Here, we want to highlight that although we show the proposed method has higher transferability in Tables 2 and 5, the main goal of this paper is still performing the **white-box red-teaming with meaningful prompts** to assess the reliability of LLMs\u2019 safety features, instead of improving the transferability of the generated jailbreak prompts. \n\nIn the adversarial domain, improving the transferability of the generated adversarial examples is also an important research topic, which needs non-trivial efforts. Additionally, as the APIs have additional safeguard mechanisms such as content filtering (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter), and advanced alignment methods are being conducted continually, we believe attacking such black-box APIs needs systematic efforts to ensure their effectiveness and reproducibility. Attacking the most cutting-edge APIs like the latest GPT-4 will be our future work. \n\n[1] Zou, A., Wang, Z., Kolter, J. Z., & Fredrikson, M. (2023).
