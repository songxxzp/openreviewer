We would like to suggest that the majority of the experiments are all conducted using M-scaled Zipformer model, hence the difference of # params on L-scaled model between Zipformer and Conformer does not invalidate the conclusions we claimed in the manuscript. When it comes to Zipformer-L, we would like to slightly extend the boundary of where it could reach to given its efficiency in resource usage and computational time."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "From my biased view, the major weakness in this paper lies in the fact that this work actually presents two inter-connected but (arguably) separate works: one is to the novel new encoder structure, including the U-net with middle stacks operate at a lower frame rates, sharing the attention weight with two self attentions, a novel non-linear attention, a BiasNorm and a slightly modified swooshL/swooshR activation function; the other is about the modified Adam optimizer, scaledAdam, which the authors claim that it can explicitly learn the parameter scale, which the widely used adam failed to. Though the author gives some motivations behind these changes and give some ablation studies, it still points to the following unanswered questions: \n\n  - the authors claim that the zipformer is better than the (reproduced) conformer, squeezeformer or other variants of transformer. However, it is unclear to me whether this is because of the model structure or because of the modified optimizer ? For example, in Table 5, the author presents that with all the proposed change (model and optimizer), zipformer-M can achieve 4.79% WER on test-other, however, with the standard adam optimizer, the WER becomes 5.51%. Will the other variants of transformer get better WER with the author proposed optimizer ? \n\n  - On the other hand, I am wondering whether the proposed optimizer, which has many adhoc modifications compared with the much widely used adam optimizer, can be more widely used for other deep learning optimization tasks or does it only work for speech tasks or does it only work for zipformer ? Given the zipformer-L is a pretty small model (only 60M parameters) trained on limited data (<1000hrs) according to today's standard,  will the proposed change still work better than the standard adam when the model and the training data scales up? \n\n\nOther weakness of this paper include: \n\n  - The authors propose changes to many widely used components, which have been well tested over time and over different tasks beyond just speech recognition. For example, the authors claim that the mean extraction in layer norm is not necessary and also remove the variance normalization. While this may seem to work for authors use case, I am intrigued to learn how generalizable this claim can be. \n\n  - Some of the proposed modification seem arbitrary. It would be great if the authors can explain a bit. For example, in Eq (4), for the swooshR and swooshL functions, how the -0.08 is selected ? The authors mentioned that the coefficient 0.035 in Eq (4) is slightly tuned. How general is this parameter ? \n\n- In the ablation study, quite a few modifications results in less than 0.2% absolute WER change. How sensitive of the WERs on librispeech relative to other factors like checkpoint choosing, different training run with different seed ? In my own experiments, these factors can result in up to 0.1% WER changes.\n\n\n- The authors also miss a series of work in the literature that directly apply standard transformer (without much modification) for ASR. For example, \n   * Y. Wang, A. Mohamed, D. Le, C. Liu et al., \u201cTransformer-based Acoustic Modeling for Hybrid Speech Recognition,\u201d in Proc ICASSP, 2020, it reports a WER of 2.26% / 4.85% on test-clean/test-other of librispeech, achieved by CTC + external NNLM; \nThis is followed by a work in: \n  * Zhang, Frank, et al. \"Faster, simpler and more accurate hybrid asr systems using wordpieces.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.09150 (2020).\nwhich achieves a WER of 2.10% and 4.20% using a similar architecture. \n\nIt is also noted that in \n\n- Wang, Y., Chen, Z., Zheng, C., Zhang, Y., Han, W. and Haghani, P., 2023, June. Accelerating rnn-t training and inference using ctc guidance. In ICASSP 2023-2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 1-5). IEEE.\n\nIt achieved almost the same WER as the initial conformer paper, but part of the conformer layers (10 out of total 17 layers) is running at much lower frame rate (about 120ms-160ms per frame). This is related to the temporal downsampling used in zipformer."

The model structure is mainly for higher efficiency. Swoosh functions and ScaledAdam have greater impact on performance improvement. \n\n> Will the other variants of transformer get better WER with the author proposed optimizer ?\n\nWe validated ScaledAdam on LibriSpeech using a 12-layer Conformer  (attention dim=512, feed-forward dim=2048). Results indicate that ScaledAdam leads to faster convergence and better performance on Conformer.\n\n* Adam (epoch index, WER(%) on test-clean/test-other): \n\nepoch-10, 3.13/7.62; epoch-20, 2.83/6.88; epoch-30, 2.76/6.67; \n\nepoch-40, 2.79/6.62; epoch-50, 2.77/6.48; epoch-60, 2.74/6.43.\n\n* ScaledAdam: \n\nepoch-10, 3.15/7.35; epoch-20, 2.68/6.32; epoch-30, 2.55/6.12; \n\nepoch-40, 2.53/5.96; epoch-50, 2.55/6.02; epoch-60, 2.55/6.0.\n\n> I am wondering whether the proposed optimizer ... does it only work for speech tasks or does it only work for zipformer?\n\nWe validated ScaledAdam and Swoosh on LM task. Results of LMs with 18 transformer layers using GeLU (#param. 98M) trained on the Libriheavy transcripts (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08105.pdf) suggest they can improve the performance:\n\nExp1: Adam w. CosineAnnealingLR and lr=4e-4;\n\nExp2: ScaledAdam w. Eden and $\\alpha_{\\text{base}}=0.025$;\n\nExp3: ScaledAdam w. Eden and $\\alpha_{\\text{base}}=0.025$, replace GeLU with SwooshL. \n\nTrained for 12000 iter with 1B tokens, the validation loss values (negative log-likelihood): \n\nExp1: 0.947; Exp2: 0.9369; Exp3: 0.9229\n\nTrained for 24000 iter with 2B tokens, the validation loss values (negative log-likelihood): \n\nExp1: 0.9068; Exp2: 0.885; Exp3: 0.8725\n\n> Given the zipformer-L is a pretty small model ... when the model and the training data scales up?\n\nAs in Table 4, experiments on the 10000-hr WenetSpeech manifest that Zipformer-M/L outperform all other models on Test Net and Test Meeting sets. \n\nA 288M Zipformer on the 10000-hr GigaSpeech gets WERs of 10.07/10.19 on dev/test sets, while the 66M Zipformer-M gets 10.25/10.38. To the best of our knowledge, this is so far the lowest WER reported on GigaSpeech as on https://github.com/SpeechColab/GigaSpeech. \n\n> The authors propose changes to many widely used components, ..., I am intrigued to learn how generalizable this claim can be.\n\nWe would like to emphasize the components are focused on ASR. Our experiments on LM task suggest that these can be generalized to other tasks to a certain extent, e.g., ScaledAdam and Swoosh. Please refer to the response of question 3. \n\nEmpirically, the mean subtraction is used by systems with LayerNorm as a way to \"defeat LayerNorm\", by making certain elements very large and nearly constant. This is not necessary with BiasNorm because we can \"defeat normalization\" by having a large learnable bias. We normalize the vector by RMS instead of Var. We found an extra sqrt in the denominator in Eq.2 and removed that in the revised version. \n\n> Some of the proposed modification seem arbitrary. It would be great if the authors can explain a bit. For example, in Eq (4), for the swooshR and swooshL functions, how the -0.08 is selected ? The authors mentioned that the coefficient 0.035 in Eq (4) is slightly tuned. How general is this parameter?\n\nThe -0.08 is chosen to make the negative slope to be 10% of the positive slope. \nThe coefficient 0.035 was tuned on LibriSpeech and maintained the same on all other experiments including the LM ones, suggesting its capability of generalization (refer to the response of question 3). \n\n> How sensitive of the WERs on librispeech relative to other factors like checkpoint choosing, different training run with different seed?\n\nIn our experiments, we search for different checkpoints for decoding and report the best result. In training, we set a fixed random seed for the libraries, such as random, numpy, and torch. \n\n> Missing references\n\nWe have added these references in Section 2. \n\n> About the referred paper Accelerating rnn-t training and inference using ctc guidance\n\nWe cited it in Section 2 as a related work. It leverages the guidance from the auxiliary CTC head to skip frames on the encoder output and even in the middle of the encoder. However, our work focus on improving the sequence encoder structure itself. \n\n> In Table 5 and section 4.0.3, it is unclear to me ... for different temporal resolution.\n\nAs described in Section 3.1 and Section 4.0.1 (in Table 1), stacks are of various embedding dims and feed-forward dims. For the ablation study ``no temporal downsampling\", we use Conv-Embed with downsampling rate of 4, and 12 Zipformer blocks with the same dimensions as in the middle stack (embedding dim=512, feed-forward dim=1536)."

Now we have way too little analysis for each of the introduced methods to really tell how good they are. The ablation study is basically only a single experiment, showing ScaledAdam vs Adam, or LayerNorm vs BiasNorm. A single experiment is not really enough to really see how ScaledAdam vs Adam performs, or BiasNorm vs LayerNorm, etc. E.g. replaying LayerNorm by BiasNorm in a standard Transformer, maybe for language modeling, how would this perform? Many of these introduced methods seem to be quite orthogonal to each other.\n\n- For comparisons, it would have been better to use a more standard transducer, not a pruned transducer. Or maybe even CTC, or CTC/AED. This would have made it easier to compare the results to other results from the literature (Table 2).\n\n- Measuring just FLOPs can sometimes be misleading as indicator for speed, because certain operations might be faster than others, and certain operations can be executed in parallelized, while others can not. It would be interesting to also see the actual measured speed on some given hardware.\n\n- No systematic comparison to other Conformer variants, e.g. E-Branchformer, etc. (I don't just mean to have the number from literature as a comparison, as done in Table 2.

What batch sizes are used?\n\n\n> Downsample module averages every 2 frames with 2 learnable scalar weights (after softmax normalization)\n\nI don't exactly understand how this is done. For the whole module, there are two learnable scalar weights only? So it could learn to always take really the average, but also to always take the first and ignore the second, or vice versa? This does not make sense to me. Why does it make sense to learn that? What happens if you just take the average? Or maybe use max-pooling instead? What is the influence of this?\n\n\nIf you downsample at the very end to 25 Hz, why not do that earlier, and downsample right in the beginning to 25 Hz, and then never to 50 Hz again? That would make it quite a bit faster. So how much worse does this get?\n\n\nLayerNorm/BiasNorm: When there is a large value, as even explicitly modelled by the bias in BiasNorm, isn't this a problem, that there is a large number in the denominator, so then all the values become very small? The exp(\u03b3) can compensate that then again, however, I wonder if there are numerical problems.\n\nWhat is the influence of exp(\u03b3) vs just \u03b3 (without exp) in BiasNorm?\n\n\nHow does ScaledAdam compare to methods like WeightNorm, where the weights are also normalized?\n\n\n> Since Adam is nearly invariant to changes in the gradient scale, for simplicity we replace this with ht = gt \u00b7(rt\u22121 \u2299\u03b8t\u2032\u22121) = gt \u00b7\u03b8t\u22121\n\nI'm not sure that this would make the code simpler, to have this special case? But I also wonder, what is the influence of this?\n\n\nFor ScaledAdam, as I understand,\u00a0adding the learnable parameter scale would actually change the model, as this scale now is also part of the model? Is this added for every parameter, or only some selected ones, e.g. the linear transformations?\n\nWhat is the influence of the Eden learning rate scheduling?"

Together with a language model, as far as I know, the best result is 3.65% WER on test-other with the E-Branchformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00077).\n\nOk, but it's also legitimate to specifically look at results without external language model, as the authors do here. But in that case, they also don't quite reach state-of-the-art on test-other, which is still by the original Conformer-L with 4.3%, better than 4.38% which they reach here.\n\nOn test-clean, without language model, yes, I think they reached state-of-the-art. But this is maybe the not-so-interesting-case.\n\nNonetheless, the results they present are still very good, and specifically their relative improvements.\n\nBut more critically speaking, you could also say, their Conformer baseline with  5.55% WER on test-other is a bit weak baseline compared to other standard Conformer results, e.g. the 4.3% by Gulati et al., 2020, or 4.74% in https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00077."

It is possible that the BiasNorm might not work for LM task, since our modification are done based on the observation on ASR experiments. The ablation study in Tab. 5 manifests that it is effective on Zipformer models. \n\n> For comparisons, it would have been better to use a more standard transducer, ... would have made it easier to compare the results to other results from the literature (Table 2).\n\nWe updated results of Zipformer models with CTC and CTC/AED systems in Appx.

Overall, Zipformer models still outperform other ASR encoders. \n\n> The actual measured speed on some given hardware.\n\nWe compared the speed and memory usage between different ASR encoders in inference mode on a 32G V100 in Figure 3. In overall, Zipformer achieves a better trade-off between performance and efficiency than other encoders. \n\n> No systematic comparison to other Conformer variants\n\nBesides the performance comparison in Table 2, Figure 3 compares their efficiency in terms of speed and memory usage, and Sec. 2 describes their architectures and main difference between Zipformer and these variants. \n\n> How long does the training take?

This slightly outperforms average-pooling and max-pooling, on LibriSpeech test-clean/test-other: \n\n* ours, 2.21/4.79\n\n* average, 2.18/4.96\n\n* max-pooling, 2.24/4.87\n\n> If you downsample at the very end to 25 Hz, why not do that earlier ...

This level of downsampling at the middle stack might be too aggressive to cause information loss. \n\n> LayerNorm/BiasNorm: When there is a large value, ..., I wonder if there are numerical problems.\n\nIt wouldn't be so large as to cause numerical problems. It just needs large enough to dominate the denominator so that the some length information could be retained, e.g., 50 in LayerNorm. \n\n> What is the influence of exp(\u03b3) vs just \u03b3 (without exp) in BiasNorm?\n\nLearning the scale in log space is safer in theory, since it avoids the gradient oscillation problem that we describe in Sec. 3.3. \n\n> How does ScaledAdam compare to methods like WeightNorm, where the weights are also normalized? For ScaledAdam, as I understand, adding the learnable parameter scale would actually change the model, as this scale now is also part of the model? Is this added for every parameter, or only some selected ones, e.g. the linear transformations?\n\nWeightNorm decouples the magnitude of a parameter from its direction, resulting in two parameters. ScaledAdam does not learn an extra parameter for the scale. It learns the scale by adding an update term (in Eq. 7), which amounts to adding an extra gradient term in the direction of rescaling each parameter. It eliminates the need to specify the modules to apply the weight normalization. \n\nWe mentioned this in Sec. 3.5 of the revised version.\n\n> I'm not sure that this would make the code simpler, to have this special case? But I also wonder, what is the influence of this?\n\nThis makes the code simpler as we don't need to compute $\\boldsymbol\\theta_{t-1}'$, which makes almost no impact since Adam's update magnitudes are invariant to gradient rescaling. \n\n> What is the influence of the Eden learning rate scheduling?\n\nEden is specially designed for ScaledAdam. Since ScaledAdam is more stable than Adam, we don't need a long warm-up period like in Conformer's learning rate schedule. We also use larger learning rate values, because we scale the update by parameter RMS (in Eq. 6), which is normally much smaller than one."

It allows to efficiently learn representation at different temporal resolutions. According to the comment, we have made this motivation more clear in the revised version.\n\nAs described in Section 3.2, Zipformer block has about twice the depth of the Conformer block, reusing the attention weights in different module to save computation and memory.\n\n> The results on aishell1 is not quite convincing compared to other conformer variants. The author could elaborate more on the performance. Could be that this is a small dataset?\n\nYes, Aishell-1 is a small dataset containing only 170 hours of speech, which is described in Section 4.0.1. Note that as presented in Table 3, Zipformer-S achieves better performance than Conformer implemented in ESPnet toolkit with fewer parameters, and scaling up Zipformer achieves better performance. \n\n> Curious about whether the authors tried the new activation functions, biasnorm and scaledadam on other tasks? Do they still show superiority?\n\nWe tried Swoosh function, BiasNorm, and ScaledAdam on language modeling task. Experimental results indicate that ScaledAdam and Swoosh function are able to improve the performance, while BiasNorm can't. Specifically, we build an 98M language model with 18 transformer layers with GeLU activation. The model is trained on the transcripts of Libriheavy dataset (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.08105.pdf). The transcripts are converted into 500-class BPE tokens. We conduct following experiments: \n\n**Exp1**: use Adam optimizer with CosineAnnealingLR schedule and lr=4e-4;\n\n**Exp2**: use ScaledAdam optimizer with Eden schedule and $\\alpha_{\\text{base}}=0.025$;\n\n**Exp3**: use ScaledAdam optimizer with Eden schedule and $\\alpha_{\\text{base}}=0.025$, replace GeLU with SwooshL. \n\nWhen trained for 12000 iterations with 1B tokens, the validation loss values (negative log-likelihood) are: \n\n**Exp1**: 0.947; **Exp2**: 0.9369; **Exp3**: 0.9229\n\nWhen trained for 24000 iterations with 2B tokens,  the validation loss values (negative log-likelihood) are: \n\n**Exp1**: 0.9068; **Exp2**: 0.885; **Exp3**: 0.8725\n\n> How could you make the model work in streaming fasion?\n\nThe way to make conformer streaming also applies to Zipformer. Specifically, for attention modules, in training we could limit the future contexts by applying the block-triangular masks on attention weights. We should also replace regular convolutions with causal convolutions. In inference, we could cache the left contexts for attention modules and convolution modules."
