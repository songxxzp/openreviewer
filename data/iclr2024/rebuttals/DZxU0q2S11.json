Using novel terminology, bounds on the width of ReLU networks for such polytope data are given. It is claimed these bounds are the first such bounds in terms of topological data structure. Numerical experiments are given which are claimed to verify the theory."

                        "value": "We have summarized your concerns and questions below for a detailed response.\n\n>**W1, Q4. The relationship of novel terminologies used in this paper to other ideas learning theory is unclear. For instance, what is the relationship between the margin $\\varepsilon$ of a \"feasible architecture\" on a manifold and the generalization error of that architecture on that manifold? Can you clarify the relationship of your novel terms to other terms in learning theory?**\n\nIn our work, the margin $\\varepsilon$ in Definition 3.1 signifies that if $\\varepsilon$ is large, the data manifold may have a 'simple' polytope-basis cover, involving fewer polytopes or a smaller total number of faces. Consequently, the network architecture proposed in Theorem 3.4 suggests that *'the large margin cover can be approximated with a reduced number of neurons.'* In other words, increasing the filtration value $\\varepsilon$ generally leads to a decreased number of neurons, establishing a connection between generalization error and network architecture from the perspective of learning theory.\n\nThe insights from Theorem 3.5 can be grasped through a similar approach. In this theorem, we present a bound in terms of the dimension of the simplicial complex and the number of its faces. In TDA, the simplicial complex tends to simplify as the filtration value $\\varepsilon$ increases, consequently, our bounds in Theorem 3.5 decrease. This highlights the correlation between the growth in the number of required neurons (the network width) and the increasing complexity of the dataset geometry.\n\n>**W2. Proof of Proposition C.1 is not convincing, you assume existence of function then proe NN equals to this function. How do you know NN exists? UAP guarantees but it is what you try to prove indeed?**\n \nHere we provide detailed explanations. What Proposition C.1 demonstrates is that if we can construct a constant function with its support sufficiently 'close' to $\\mathcal{X}$, then we can also construct a function whose $L^p$ distance from $1_{\\mathcal{X}}$ is sufficiently small. \nIn simpler terms, the proposition establishes that *\"constructing the indicator function\"* is more difficult than *\"approximating the indicator function in $L^p$ sense.\"* This is the reason why we solved the first problem.\nIn the revised paper, we have added some sentences to provide a more detailed understanding. Refer to the first paragraph on page 3 in the revised manuscript.\n\n\n>**W3, W4, W6, Q2, Q3. It is clear that ReLU networks can fit polytopes exactly, but it is not clear how well they can fit arbitrary manifolds. What guarantees are there for finding a tight cover for a given manifold? How do you actually find a polytope-basis cover?**\n\nIndeed, this is the common concern raised by all reviewers. Please refer to General Comments KR1 in the overall comment for the detailed response.\n\n\n>**W5, Q5. Missing some discussion of prior related work on relating topological characteristics to generalization theory.**\n \nWe have revised the paper to have relevant comparison with prior related work. See KR2 in General comments. \n\n\n>**W7. Many strong claims are made in this paper, and after reading the paper it's not altogether clear to me they are substantiated.**\n \nThroughout the revisions, we have improved the flow of our manuscript and emphasized our contributions. We highly recommend reviewing Section 1 in the revised manuscript for a comprehensive understanding. In summary, our main contribution lies in providing bounds on network widths that depend on the geometric characteristics of the dataset, described in terms of its polytope cover.\n\n\n>**W8. Proposition 3.5 seems trivial.**\n\nIt might be understood trivially. In the revised paper, we have moved this result to the appendix, and removed from our main contributions.\n\n\n>**Q1. Is topological space really the right level of generality for this paper? Why not just consider manifolds? The former is substantially more general, and it appears you only consider subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$.**\n \nThank you for highlighting a crucial aspect. As you suggested, the role of neural networks in real-world applications is not merely to distinguish a data point within $\\mathbb{R}^d$, but rather to establish a decision boundary against other classes. In response to your feedback, we have slightly generalized the definition of a *'convex polytope'* in Definition E.1 in the revised paper. Then, our theoretical results still hold with this definition, where the setting becomes more practical.\n\nFurthermore, we want to emphasize that our empirical findings in Appendix E demonstrate that each class in the real datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR10) datasets can be effectively classified by a *'convex polytope'* characterized by a simple number of faces. Therefore, our result in Theorem 3.4 can provide the feasible architecture of neural networks on these datasets."

Authors describe four constructions of  two to four layers neural networks, approximating indicator functions on convex polytopes, difference of unions of polytopes, simplicial complexes, and convex polytopes with prism-shaped polytopes removed.   Some lower bounds on the width of neural networks approximating such indicator functions  are also stated.  Finally, the work verifies that the constructed networks for convex polytopes can be reached via gradient descent optimization if it is initialized from certain regions of weight space."

It is not clear how to count the numbers of polytopes, or j-dim facets in simplicial complex, necessary to approximate a given real-world dataset, so the practical application  of the results is somewhat unclear. \n\n2) Presentation of the paper suffers from several drawbacks. The paper contributions are theoretical, but the presented in the article proofs are too sketchy. The article is intended for a wider iclr community, but because it is too sketchy in the main part, a smooth reading  even for experts is questionable, cf below. \n\n3) Another drawback of the presentation, in the case of the lower bounds: the principal lower bound argument involves the \"bent hyperplane argument\"  used in several previous works. However the paper does not explain clearly what was done in this context in the previous works compared with what constitutes the paper's novelty when establishing the lower bounds. \n\n4) The numerous allusions to topological aspects are heavily overstated. The only place, where some topological notion appears, namely Betti numbers,  is in the fourth construction (Theorem 3.7) involving the polytopes with  prism-shaped polytopes removed. However in this context the (d-i)-th Betti number is simply the number of the removed prism-shaped convex polytopes with maximum i unbounded axes, so the Betti numbers can be replaced by such simple counters in the Theorem 3.7.  \n\n5) Related work section does not mention vast literature on geometry and topology applications in analysis of data representations, eg  Kim K et al. \"Pllay: Efficient topological layer based on persistent landscapes.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020), Barannikov, S et al. \"Manifold Topology Divergence: a Framework for Comparing Data Manifolds.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021), Barannikov, S et al. \"Representation Topology Divergence: A Method for Comparing Neural Network Representations.\" ICML (2022).\n\n6) The verification of possibility to reach the constructed networks via gradient descent optimization is somewhat limited as it is only applicable to some initializations satisfying some additional conditions and not to others. \n\n\nBelow are some specific remarks:\n- page 1: The figure appearing on the article first page usually serves to highlight the principal contribution of the paper, does the standard Figure 1 with very well-known XOR dataset really serve such purpose? \n\n- page 2: \"considering the given dataset as  a topological space\" -> considering the support of the data distribution as a topological space? \n\n- page 2: \"We answer this question by constructing a collection of convex polytopes...\" - where is it described in the paper how to construct such collection? \n\n- page 2: \"forms m-simplicial complex..., we establish  a novel topology-dependent bound\" - the bound established in Theorem 3.6 concerning simplicial complexes is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which are not \"topology-dependent\" quantities. \n\n- page 4:  \"from the volume identity of the polytope\"- what is it? a reference is necessary here. \n\n- page 5: in Theorem 3.6 \"d_1 is bounded by\" refers to the presented construction of the network, or to any 2 layer network which is feasible on X, it is not clear\n\n- page 6: \"the first result on the width of neural networks in terms of topological data structure\"- the result in Theorem 3.6 is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which is not \"in terms of topological data structure\"\n\n- page 7: \"This implies that the architecture outlined in Theorem 3.7 is dictated by the filtration parameter\"- The topological space considered in Theorem 3.7 is a convex polytope with disjoint prism-shaped convex polytopes removed, it is not the Cech complex with respect to some parameter epsilon, so there is no architecture in Theorem 3.7 related to the filtration parameter. \n- page 8: \"which completely classifying the given dataset \" - perhaps, which classifies with zero error the given dataset ?"

Lack of applications to practical real-world datasets.**\n\nIn the revised paper, we supplied empirical application of our results, involving seeking a polytope-basis cover of the real-world dataset.\nSee General Comment KR1 in the overall comments.\n\n>**W2. Paper does not provide the detail proofs in the main body, leading to bad presentation.**\n\nThanks for the constructive comment. We moved less important proofs to the appendix, and allocated more paragraphs to highlight our key ideas. See General Comment KR 2 in the overall comments.\n\n>**W3. What is the novelty of paper when establishing the lower bound, especially comparison between previous works considering used term \"bent hyperplane argument\"?**\n\nThank you for the valuable feedback.\nWe referenced the 'arrangement of bent hyperplanes' in [Hanin et al.] as the 'bent hyperplane argument' in the original manuscript to convey that we employed a similar idea to derive a lower bound on the required number of neurons. Indeed, we used this idea to explore how the decision boundary can be 'refracted' if and only if it intersects with some activation boundary of a neuron, in the proof of Proposition 3.2.\n\nHowever, as there are no previous results on such a lower bound for the number of neurons based on the number of faces of a polytope, we assert that our results are novel. [Hanin et al.] and [Grigsby et al.] utilized the concept of 'bent hyperplanes' to obtain an upper bound on the number of linear regions or to investigate topological features of the decision boundary, none of which are comparable to our geometric results.\n\n\n\n**References.**\n\n[Hanin et al.] Boris Hanin and David Rolnick.

The numerous allusions to topological aspects are heavily overstated. It only appears in Theorem 3.7 stating Betti numbers, with heavy assumptions on the shape.**\n\nRecognizing that our results primarily pertain to geometric rather than topological aspects, we have revised our manuscript, including adjustments to the title, to emphasize the geometric perspective rather than topological analysis.

Related work section does not mention vast literature on geometry and topology applications in analysis of data representations.**\n\nWe have revised our paper with additional related work and detail comparison with our results. See General Comment KR2 in the General comments. \n\n\n>**W6. Limitations regarding specific initialization for the verification of gradient descent.**\n \nOur convergence result in Theorem 4.3 demonstrates that the viability of approaching the proposed neural network through gradient descent. We want to claim that this result holds particular significance when compared to other UAP outcomes, such as those presented by [Park et al.] or [Cai], as they solely establish the existence of such neural networks without offering a convergence guarantee.\nFurthermore, we empirically validate that gradient descent reliably converges to the envisioned network.\n\nFurthermore, we want to highlight that the initialization condition is adaptable to dataset characteristics and not restricted to specific configurations. It varies based on the dataset distribution, illustrated by the fact that the permissible range for $v_0$ in equations (9) or (10) can widen as $\\rho$ decreases\u2014a constant linked to data distribution. In simpler terms, this expansion happens when data points are predominantly located on the surface of the separating polytope. Thus, we propose that these initialization conditions offer a mathematical representation of the dataset's distribution quality, providing insight into its inherent 'niceness.'\n\n\n**References.**\n\n[Park et al.] Sejun Park, Chulhee Yun, Jaeho Lee, and Jinwoo Shin.

Below, we answer for each remark.\n\n>**\u25cf page 1: The figure appearing on the article first page usually serves to highlight the principal contribution of the paper, does the standard Figure 1 with very well-known XOR dataset really serve such purpose?**\n\nWe agree with the reviewers' comment, and have changed Figure 1 to highlight our contribution. We believe this will engage readers in understanding our motivation and contributions. \n\n>**\u25cf page 2: \"considering the given dataset as a topological space\" -> considering the support of the data distribution as a topological space?**\n\nWe considered the data distribution $\\mathcal{X}$ as a topological space. In practice, it refers the manifold of each class in the dataset.\n\n>**\u25cf page 2: \"We answer this question by constructing a collection of convex polytopes...\" - where is it described in the paper how to construct such collection?**\n\nThe sentence would be corrected to, \"We answer the question when a polytope-basis cover of $\\mathcal{X}$ is given.\" For the construction of these covers, please refer to Section 5 of the revised manuscript.\n\n>**\u25cf page 2: \"forms m-simplicial complex..., we establish a novel topology-dependent bound\" - the bound established in Theorem 3.6 concerning simplicial complexes is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which are not \"topology-dependent\" quantities.**\n\nIndeed, rigorously speaking, the dimension of a simplicial complex is not a topology-dependent quantity, despite the use of simplicial complexes to explore topological properties. What we aimed to highlight was the demonstration that the bound depends on the dimension of the simplicial complex, which may be related to the topological complexity of $\\mathcal{X}$. In response to your insightful suggestion (W4 above), we have removed topological aspects in the revised paper.\n\n>**\u25cf page 4: \"from the volume identity of the polytope\"- what is it? a reference is necessary here.**\n\nThank you for a good comment. It means that the volume of a convex polytope is sum of the volume of small pyramids which is a partition of the polytope, which we only described in the proof in Appendix B.1.1. We allocated more space to explain this proof idea in the main body, in the revised version.\n\n>**\u25cf page 5: in Theorem 3.6 \"$d_1$ is bounded by\" refers to the presented construction of the network, or to any 2 layer network which is feasible on X, it is not clear**\n\nThe $d_1$ refers the width in the presented construction of the network, not any 2-layer. We have modified the sentence.\n\n>**\u25cf page 6: \"the first result on the width of neural networks in terms of topological data structure\"- the result in Theorem 3.6 is in terms of numbers of j-dimensional facets, which is not \"in terms of topological data structure\"**\n\nThis is similar to one of the previous comments above. We initially considered it to be related to topological data structure, but we have removed some sentences that might be understood as an overstatement.\n\n>**\u25cf page 7: \"This implies that the architecture outlined in Theorem 3.7 is dictated by the filtration parameter\"- The topological space considered in Theorem 3.7 is a convex polytope with disjoint prism-shaped convex polytopes removed, it is not the Cech complex with respect to some parameter epsilon, so there is no architecture in Theorem 3.7 related to the filtration parameter.**\n\nThank you for the significant comment. We decided to remove this part from our draft.\n\n>**\u25cf page 8: \"which completely classifying the given dataset \" - perhaps, which classifies with zero error the given dataset?**\n\nThe sentence means the classifier with zero error on the given dataset. We have modified the sentence in the revised version."

How does the increase in the number of classes, and hence perhaps overlapping polytopes add to the complexity of the construction [Page 21]?\n\n2. The optimality of $3$-layer ReLU networks for approximating indicators is clear from Proposition C.1 and C.2. Is it true for high-dimensional compactly supported functions ($f: R^d \\to R^l$), $l>1$ in general, perhaps of some regularity in terms of smoothness? This seems crucial as there are numerous UA bounds for Lipschitz maps using ReLU feed-forward networks. \n\n3. Can the authors comment on how well the prescriptions regarding architectures hold up against simpler real datasets? As a practitioner, it is often frustrating to witness theoretical suggestions underperforming significantly. For example, to my knowledge, there exists no consistent method of estimating Betti numbers corresponding to even simpler real data distributions, if they at all have punctured supports."

                        "value": ">**Q1. How Theorem 4.3 can be improved, for example, when the dataset is non-convexly separated or the number of classes is greater than 2?**\n\nTheorem 4.3 explains that if a two-layer ReLU network is initialized in proximity to the polytope cover, gradient descent may converge to the global minimum. This result readily extends to multiple polytopes or a polytope-basis cover.\nSpecifically, consider a scenario with $m$ polytopes covering a single class and a three-layer network $\\mathcal{T}$ as defined in Proposition 3.7, equation (5) in the revised paper. Assuming the $m$ subnetworks, denoted as $\\mathcal{N}_i$, are initialized near polytopes, satisfying the conditions in Theorem 4.3.\nThen, we can apply Theorem 4.3 to each polytope individually. \nThis is possible because $\\mathcal{T}$ is the minimum of $m$ two-layer ReLU networks - it is important to note that the $\\min$ operation in the network executes all gradients in backpropagation, except only one subnetwork for each input. This establishes the extension of Theorem 4.3 to a polytope-basis cover for three-layer ReLU networks. \n\n>**Q2. Is it possible to obtain some UAP results of the 3-layer ReLU networks to approximate a compactly supported functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^{d_x} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_y}$, in terms of smoothness?**\n\nThank you for a insightful question. We obtained that it is possible. \nSince we proposed a method to approximate the indicator function in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ by a 3-layer ReLU network, a common idea in Lebesgue theory easily generalizes this result to approximate a compactly supported functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^{d_x} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_y}$.\nWe propose the result in the appendix. See Theorem C.5 in the revised paper.\nAs the reviewer anticipated, the width is related with the error bound and the Lipshictz constant of $f$.\n\nRemark. Notably, (Wang et al., 2022) recently proved that 2-layer ReLU networks cannot approximate a compactly supported function in $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, while 3-layer ReLU networks can. However, their proof establishes only the existence of such networks without offering any width bounds. \nConsequently, our result in Theorem C.5 represents a refinement of their findings. \nThis is one example that our results on polytope can be leveraged to derive width bounds for the UAP. \n\n**Reference.**\n\n[Wang et al., 2022] Ming-Xi Wang and Yang Qu. Approximation capabilities of neural networks on unbounded domains. Neural Networks, 145:56\u201367, 2022.\n\n\n>**Q3. How can your results be applied to real datasets?**\n\nIn the revised paper, we supplied empirical application of our results, by constructing a polytope-basis cover of the given real  dataset.\nSee General Comment KR1 in the overall comments."

Why did the authors choose to approximate the indicator function?**\n\nThank you for the valuable feedback. Indeed, approximating the indicator function is generally more difficult than just classifying finite classes in the dataset. However, if a neural network $\\mathcal{N}$ can effectively approximate the indicator function on a given dataset class $\\mathcal{X}$, it inherently possesses the capability to classify $\\mathcal{X}$ from other classes. We intended to set the goal of our paper to cover not only classification tasks, but also regression tasks. We have indeed considered the MSE loss function in Section 4 (see Theorem 4.3), and we have included a simple approximation result in Theorem C.5, requested by Reviewer nRVF. See footnote 1 on page 4 of the revised manuscript for more detail.\n\n\n>**Q2. What does the terminology `architecture' (denoted by $\\mathcal{A}$) exactly mean?**\n\nIn our manuscript, the terminology `architecture' refers to the structure of neural networks, specifically the depth and width of each hidden layer. We introduced a notation, $d \\rightarrow d_1 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow d_k \\rightarrow 1$, to represent a $k$-layer neural network with widths $d_1, \\cdots, d_k$ in the manuscript, and we did not fix the network architecture. \n\nAs you commented, the UAP result can be achieved when the the hidden layer dimension is allowed, as presented in Theorem C.5.\nMore precisely, the hidden widths grows $O(\\varepsilon^{-d_x})$ as the error bound  $\\varepsilon$ reduces. Similarly, our other results (Theorem 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) imply that the width increases as the number of polytopes and their faces increases. Precisely, Theorem 3.5 explicitly demonstrates how the width grows with the increasing complexity of the simplicial complex.\nWe have made this part clearer in the revised manuscript (see Section 3.1 and Definition 3.1 of the revised paper)."
