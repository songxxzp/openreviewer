                    "value": "This paper tries to establish weak correlations among derivatives of an NN wrt to its degrees of freedom as the underlying mechanism of linearization of gradient-based learning behaviour in infinitely or very wide neural networks. More precisely, it is claimed that (i) NNs exhibit weak correlations, and (ii) gradient-based (possibly more general) learning systems linearize under weak correlations.\nTo this end, the author(s) introduce the concept of random tensor asymptotic behaviour in order to establish bounds on said derivative correlations, and in such a manner that the Neural Tangent Kernel exhibits a special case. It is then claimed a tight bound on higher order derivative correlations, eventually leading to the traditional NTK regime, i.e. that vanishing higher order contributions effectively constitute the training linearization (and not the other way around)."

Even after studying the supplementary material, the overall synthesis of the many involved steps, aspects and \"directions\" is incoherent/confusing.  Most notably, \"m(n)\" is used to establish the main theorems, but the definition of \"m(n)\" is nowhere to be found (also not in the supplementary), except for a prosaic description of \"the typical parameter of the linearization/correlation decay where m(n) \u2192 \u221e\". This is in contradiction to the seeming mathematical rigour and elaborateness. \n\n(2) The paper presents no experiment(s). The work would strongly benefit from numerical examples to more clearly support the claims and illustrate the implications & significance of this work. This should at least include 2 manufactured toy examples, where (i) linearization is demonstrated in correspondence with weak correlations, as well as (ii) the opposite of that. Also the transition regime is interesting. Or even better, maybe even real-world applications can be found for demonstration"

E.g. the meaning of the crucial limiting parameter is discussed only several pages after theorems have been stated with it. For building intuition with the reader, it could be helpful to first discuss a simple low-rank example\n\n(2) The paper would benefit from a clear delimitation of scope, discussion of limitations, disadvantages\n\n(3) The authors state \"Our theorem will be applicable solely for systems that are properly scaled in the\ninitial condition where n \u2192 \u221e\". What does that mean?\n\n(4) There are several incomplete sentences"

                    "value": "The problem it aims is to give precise criteria for linearized training (i.e. NTK-like) to occur (e.g. we know it occurs in the limit of infinite width given a specific parameterization [Jacot et al. 2018] or when we add a large scaling factor [Chizat et al. 2020]). It also claims to prove that wide NNs satisfy these precise criteria but this result is not properly stated in the main.\n\nA half of the paper is devoted to a formalism on measuring asymptotic behavior of random tensors. This formalism aims to give precise definition for \"M_n = O_{n \\to \\infty} (a_n)\", where M_n is a sequence of random tensors and a_n is a number sequence. This definition has nothing to do with the tensor itself but rather deals directly with its operator norm. Therefore it should be applicable to sequences of random variables; it would be helpful for the reader to understand how this notion is different to the usual \"stochastic Big O\".\n\nThe results are presented in a very general form making them difficult to consume. I would suggest the authors putting a simplified formulation in the main, maybe also a proof sketch, as well as some application examples, in particular *emphasizing the cases where their analysis allows one to gain insight over the existing methods*. \n\nThe significance of the results are not convincing. When are these results able to prove linearized training in cases where [Lee et al., 2019] does not apply? Both results are asymptotic in nature; what are the cases when the claimed results are stronger?\n\nThe paper contains no experimental evidence that the results are applicable in practice, it would be good to add some. \n\nThe literature review is a little thin. The paper does not mention the work of [Dyer & Gur-Ari, 2020] that seems very relevant."

For instance, there are double factorials in the main, but they appear nowhere in the final result (and again, given that it is a 'soft' result, they cannot be of any importance for the whole result). \n\nAlso, some things are not correctly written (e.g. the NTK does not converge to the target function as written somewhere)."

                    "value": "This paper asks why overparameterized neural networks can be linearised with respect to their parameters (e.g. in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime), and propose that the reason is weak correlations between the first and higher derivatives of the model function. With respect to previous work, they consider the case of neural networks with two distinct activation functions and the deviation from linearity during SGD training."

                    "value": "In my opinion this work fails on providing and/or communicating anything new on the topic.\n\n1) Discussion on some very important related work is missing, which this work should have compare with.\n2) Several statements are unsupported, definitions are missing, there are several inaccuracies and the paper is overall very hard to follow.\n3) The mathematical notation is cumbersome and, for no apparent reason, completely different from many related papers.\n4) Crucial points are relegated to the appendix, without which the main text is severely incomplete.\n\nThe main reference missing is \u201cOn the linearity of large non-linear models: when and why the tangent kernel is constant\u201d, NeurIPS 2020 by Liu, Zhu, Belkin (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01092), but there are many other papers following this one that have studied the question of why neural networks can be linearised, also in relation to the model derivatives.\nThis line of work is not discussed at all. \n\ni) As a main contribution, the author list the case of \u201cwide neural networks with two distinct activation functions\u201d, but the only thing they say about this case in the main text is one sentence on page 9, relegating all about this claim in the appendix (we are not even told what \u201cneural networks with two distinct activation functions\u201d mean in the main text).\nii) Section 2 is completely unmotivated and its relevance remains unclear until much later. For example, in the first three paragraphs of section 2.2 it\u2019s unclear what is the goal and the challenges in reaching the goal.\niii) The function \\Epsilon is supposed to be a generic convex function, but there seems to be an (unstated) assumption that it depends on the difference between F and y, which is true for the square loss but not for many other commonly used loss functions.\niv) (x,y) are called, respectively, label and images, but it should be the other way around.\nv) A \u201climiting parameter\u201d in introduced on page 5 but never explained in the main text\nvi) Equation 9 only applies to gradient flow, not to gradient descent. After reading Theorem 3.1 it becomes clear that Equation 9 is a definition, but until then it just looks like a mistake.\nvii) Below Equation 12, Why can the parameter indices viewed as random variables? They are not random variables, and they are not drawn from a uniform distribution. Instead, all indices are summed over all the parameters. If they were a sample from a uniform distribution, there would be some noise.\nviii) No intuition is given here about the relevance of the quantity introduced in equation 12.\nix) I don't understand Definition 3.2. \"O\" is supposed to be limiting order. What is \"O\" there?\nx) n0 not defined in equations (16) and (17)\nxi) There should not be a Delta in the second expression of equation (17)\nxii) Inequality 19 seems to be crucial for obtaining the results. However, the statement \"nearly all realistic scalable systems satisfy\" is not justified.\nxiii) What does \"typical parameter of the linearization/correlation decay\" mean?\nxiv) \u201cThis scenario is a little more complex but can be dealt with.\u201d How is this scenario dealt with? It seems the reader here just needs to trust the authors without any explanation or justification.\nxv) \u201cThese systems can be interpreted as non-linear dynamical systems.\u201d Any reference for this statement?\n\ni) The Jacobian of the model is called \u201c\u201dderivative matrix and is transposed with respect to the Jacobian that everyone uses.\nii) I have never seen a gradient with a subscript \u201cT\u201d to denote the transpose of the operation result.\niii) In equation 12, the gradient with several subscripts and superscripts is just a (high order) partial derivative. Why re-inventing the notation?"
