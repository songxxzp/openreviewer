The segmentation ground truth is nearly identical to the organ surface, making it unreasonable to use weakly supervised learning when ground truth annotations are available.\n\nSections 3.3 and 3.4 exhibit similarities with VAE at a high level. It is unclear why a probabilistic approach is used instead of a deterministic approach, and further clarification is needed to justify this decision.\n\nThe SSL in table 1 is \u2018Self- supervised learning for few-shot medical image segmentation\u2019, not weakly supervised method. This discrepancy should be addressed and corrected.\n\nThe experiments conducted only on the BTCV dataset, which is relatively small, raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method. Considering the availability of large CT datasets, it is essential to investigate datasets with a substantial amount of CT scans to ensure the scalability and applicability of the proposed pipeline, such as AMOS, WORD and AbdomenAtlas-8K."

(2022). Moreover, leveraging probability for modulating the Cross Entropy loss isn't a novel endeavor in the domain.\n2. A glaring omission is the absence of comparative analyses with established weakly-supervised semantic segmentation techniques, especially those harnessing Class Activation Mapping (CAM).\n3. Regarding the labeling technique, the paper utilizes points evenly spread over organ surfaces. This approach begs several questions: Does this method necessitate medical practitioners to outline organ boundaries precisely? Does this annotation technique offer tangible time-saving benefits over traditional voxel-level labeling? If the chosen points were scattered randomly within organ interiors, would the model's efficacy plummet?"

The introductory segment of the paper makes a contentious claim: \"Typically, these methods directly employ sparse weak annotations, such as points or scribbles, during the training phase, potentially resulting in significant information loss.\" This stance contradicts prevalent practices. Rarely do researchers utilize weak labels for directly supervising the end segmentation model. A more widespread strategy involves harnessing deep learning tools to craft pseudo-labels, which subsequently guide a fully supervised semantic segmentation model's training.\n2. In the experiment that examines the effect of varying annotation point numbers (n), a puzzling observation emerges. As 'n' escalates, the model's performance doesn't see a proportional upswing. Strikingly, the model's output seems subpar for n = 150. This finding contradicts intuitive expectations. Can the authors shed light on this perplexing behavior?"

However, in practice, the weak annotations exist in hospital systems might be distributed irregularly. If the proposed method is only evaluated on these evenly distributed annotations, it might lost the generalization ability to the datasets in real applications.\n\n(2) The proposed confidence score also relies on the even distribution of point annotations, as it is based on the distance between the target point and the annotated point. Then, its performance could decrease significantly when adapted to the irregularly annotations.\n\n(3) The proposed segmentation loss is a simple combination of Dice and PCE, to take the pseudo labels as supervision. However, this mechanism highly relies on the threshold (hyper-parameter) to determine which pseudo label should be taken. When the annotation is not ideal, there could be a lot of noise in the generated pseudo labels, and this pipline might lost its advantage.\n\n(4) It lacks the comparison with SOTA weakly supervised medical image segmentation methods, such as  point-supervised segmentation, scribble-supervised segmentation, et al."

In the process of sparse label generation, the sampling algorithm produces evenly distributed points as annotations, but this may not be realistic and practical. It is possible that the annotation generation process have a major impact on the overall performance increase.\n- Another problem with the evaluation is that the results in the paper come from the model's performance on the validation dataset, not a hidden testing dataset. The model and hyperparameters are optimized on the validation dataset so I am not sure if the results can be generalized, even on a dataset from the same distribution.\n- The number of sample points is important as shown by the paper. But the variations in DICE and HD metrics raise questions about the stability of the proposed method. For example, why does the performance significantly drop when the number of points changes from 200 to 150?\n- The paper defines the overall probability-aware segmentation loss function as L_total = L_Seg + wL_KL. The balancing term w is set to 0.3 but the author does not explain how this is determined in the paper.
