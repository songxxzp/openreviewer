The ideas presented are not easily discernible, mainly due to the limited context and descriptions provided. To illustrate, I will provide a few examples below.\n\n1)\tIn \u201csection 3.1.1 Event\u201d, the description of intra-event relationship can be better presented. After introducing the quintuple, it is confusing what the event elements are  and why they are the \u201cthe foundation in a majority of event prediction tasks\u201d. How \u201cCAUSE\u201d relation is formulated remains unclear.\n\n2)\tThe title of the paper seems to be a combination of keywords describing the method introduced in the paper. However, motivation of using entropy is not well described. It is also not clear to me what ``ontology\u2019\u2019 refers to in this paper. The original words in the paper are \u201cEvent ontology is a shared, formal and explicit specification of an event class system model that exists objectively. With event ontology, semantic can be easier to share between entities, and it is also beneficial for strengthening representation and facilitating knowledge reuse.\u201d. Maybe using an example would be helpful. It would also be nice to talk about how \u201cdevise context into event ontology\u201d is done.\n\n3)\tIn \u201cEntropy Calculation\u201d, it is not clear what \u201can induced subgraph\u201d is and why we need it in this work. Some equations (e.g., equation 3) can be reduced or even deleted given that it is a common knowledge and it is not the main contribution of this paper. The authors claim that they \u201cnormalize the entropy of different type of edges as weights, which characterizes the dual heterogeneity of nodes and edges\u201d. This is not clear to me what \u201cdual heterogeneity\u201d is and why these entropy weights can be used to characterizes the heterogeneity.\n\n4)\tIn \u201cDual Heterogeneity Learning\u201d, it is unclear to me how \u201ccontext and kG\u201d are merged into one graph. It is also not clear how embeddings of nodes in this graph are computed for equation 8.\n\nRegarding the methodology, this paper misses important details describing the technical contributions in the proposed framework.\n\n\n*** From the perspective of evaluation, it is surprising to see no other state-of-the-art models are compared with in node classification and link prediction (only R-GCN is included). It is mentioned that graph neural networks have been developed for event prediction. I believe many existing models can be applied to this task, but no explanation is provided for the lack of comparison with other baseline approaches.\n\n*** The authors claim that one of the contributions is the establishment of a new real-world dataset. However, very limited details are provided for this dataset. What is the major purpose of this dataset? What are the nodes/edges in this data?\n\n*** Overall, I think the presentation and writing of this paper could be further improved. It is hard to judge the novelty of this work given limited clarity. More in-depth analysis on unique challenges in the dataset and results could be better delivered. I think the content should focus on explaining the major contributions in this paper instead of existing technologies (e.g., entropy or graph neural networks)."

This lack of transparency makes it difficult for other researchers to replicate and validate the presented model and dataset, which may prevent other researchers build upon or learn from this work effectively.\n- The experimental results fail to offer a comprehensive picture as there is no comparison with other state-of-the-art models. By only showing how ECO outperforms its variants in ablation style, the paper lacks convincing arguments on how it could be superior to other existing methods.\n- Writing quality of the paper is poor.

Even though the dataset of this paper is newly introduced and a little bit different from those of the previous works as listed above [1-4], the difference is not that essential. Therefore, the main arguments of this paper are questionable: 1) current works are only homogeneous; and 2) current works have not considered contexts.\n2.\tThe motivation for using this entropy-enhanced method is not well presented, especially in the introduction. It is not that obvious or intuitive to use this novel technique, thus the motivation is necessary to be presented in the introduction.\n3.\tIn line with the w1, the baseline methods are insufficient. It should compare with the works including but not limited to [1-4]. In terms of non-temporal KG methods, CompGCN [5] is also a potential well-performing baseline. In terms of the downstream task, in addition to DistMult, more effective decoders, such as ConvE[6] or ConvTransE[7], could be utilized and implemented.\n4.\tIn terms of problem formulation, the main objective of this paper is event prediction, which is implemented as two tasks of node classification and link prediction. However, from my point of view, it is better to zoom in on certain forecasting-centric settings, for example, there are follow and cause relations between the events as shown in the definition, it is more interesting to predict the next event or the caused event given a part of the follow and cause triplets. \n\n* [1] Recurrent Event Network: Autoregressive Structure Inference over Temporal Knowledge Graphs\n* [2] Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Based on Evolutional Representation Learning\n* [3] Understanding Event Predictions via Contextualized Multilevel Feature Learning\n* [4] Context-aware Event Forecasting via Graph Disentanglement\n* [5] Composition-based Multi-Relational Graph Convolutional Networks \n* [6] Convolutional 2D Knowledge Graph Embeddings.\n* [7] End-to-End Structure-Aware Convolutional Networks for Knowledge Base Completion."

Why are there only 1 nodes and 2 edges (in the Table 1 stats).\n- What about the \"Follow/Cause\" etc between events? Is that represented in this dataset? And does event prediction try to predict those?\n\n3. Overall results and other baselines (beside vanilla RGCN) - The overall result is ~30-48 on link prediction, and very low accuracy on node classification (7%). Existing ontology works should have been considered baselines on this task and dataset, rather than vanilla R-GCN alone. It is also not clear whether the RGCN performance is less because of which ablation component.\n\n4. (Minor) External knowledge and way of integrating in the ontology seems ineffective - Why isn't it better to attach the external triples as links to the event participants entities directly, rather than separately onto the context directly from the event/context elements node? (Fig 2). Is it that there are edges between say parameters_of_vessel (in context) and vessel object (in event objects)?"
