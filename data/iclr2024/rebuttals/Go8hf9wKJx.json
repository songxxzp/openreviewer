The methodology consists of three parts; textual inversion to infer the embedding, synthesizing outliers with similar concepts, and fine-tuning via outlier exposure. The method is tested on three benchmarks and generally shows improvement over compared baselines."

                    "value": "(0) Fundamentally, I am not sure why such synthesized data can be located on the **boundary** of the decision region. The synthesized images via stable diffusion deviate from the original data distribution a lot since they process different backgrounds. Furthermore, this methodology is limited when only word embeddings are simple enough that stable diffusion produces coherent images of the word.\\\n(1) I also have issues with the experimental setup. While the authors propose this as an effective outlier synthesis strategy, the experiment is done in relatively easy datasets. I think the paper can be improved by comparing it against near-OOD, or hard OOD datasets in the OpenOOD benchmark [1]. Before that, I hesitate to agree that this is an effective synthesis strategy.\\\n(2) I also think the performance of the proposed outlier synthesis strategy is not that significant. It scores 91.51 on average AUROC. I can find other simple post-hoc post-processing strategies that score 94~95 on such benchmarks [2,3], which questions the efficacy of the method. Furthermore, I am not sure why [3] scores 95\\% in the original paper but 86\\% in this manuscript.\\\n(3) I am further concerned about the empirical significance of this paper since this paper uses [3] as a testing score. This makes it hard to determine how the effect of outlier synthesis relates to that. I believe POEM does not use such ASH scoring.\\\n(4) I also feel the paper is hard to understand despite being a combination of existing works. Please explicitly note the OE loss function in mathematical form. Furthermore, what is Line 11 in the Algorithm 1? How is it done? Please give a link to the related section for improved clarity.\\\n(5) This paper generates multiple images through the diffusion model so its extra computational cost for training will be heavy. I do not see any discussions on that.\\\n(6) The paper does not discuss challenging real-world datasets (e.g. MVTec) that a stable diffusion model cannot cover. The synthesis strategy will be limited in such datasets.\\\n(7) The paper only considers relatively easy supervised setup and cannot be extended to unsupervised setup, especially when datasets with multiple semantics are given as in-distribution data. This limits the applicability of the proposed outlier synthesis strategy.\\\n(8) Furthermore, I am curious how this method performs in the one-class classification (e.g. one-class CIFAR-10/100 experiment). There exists a work that synthesizes the OOD via diffusion model on such datasets [4]. I would like to see how this method performs against [4] and other baselines, especially when $f_{\\theta}$ is trained from scratch.\n\nOverall, I have various issues with the significance and experiment of this paper. Hence, I lean to rejecting this paper."

Subsequently, this generated outlier data is employed to train an OOD detection model, following prior research in the field.
