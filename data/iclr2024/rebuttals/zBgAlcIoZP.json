The authors introduce a linear autoencoding model, then expand to a nonlinear framework using deep autoencoding. This framework aids in designing controllers using stability-constrained neural networks, without needing prior system equation knowledge. Its efficacy is demonstrated on reaction-diffusion and fluid flow systems using time series data. Empirical results are promising, when compared to existing DMD based methods."

However, application of these methods to controlled dynamical systems with dynamic control inputs is not straightforward and requires significant modification to the architecture. Recognizing this, we consider such models for our fluid flow example without any control inputs and investigate the prediction performance of VideoGPT (VQ-VAE + Transformer). Our experiment shows that VideoGPT generates accurate predictions in the short term but falls short in capturing long-term dynamics. We value your insightful suggestion and have included quantitative and qualitative results in the supplementary to encourage potential future research directions."

There is not much innovation in this paper.**\n\n**A1.** While we appreciate your assessment, it is important to note that the replacement of linear encoders and decoders with neural networks is not the primary focal point of our contribution. We acknowledge the existence of prior works exploring similar model configurations within the field. \n\nOur paper aims to establish a theoretical connection between the traditional linear approach and the emerging deep learning-based methods for the control of dynamical systems. There are several viable approaches to constructing and training an autoencoder-based ROM for PDE-driven dynamical systems, as demonstrated in recent literature. In our work, the architecture and loss functions are strategically formulated to forge a bridge between the conventional linear approach and DNN-based methods, specifically through the lens of a linear autoencoding representation of DMDc.\n\n**Q2. About the learning of the control. Since the control is of feedback type, can we use a simple supervised learning from the observed data instead of loss (15)?**\n\n**A2.** The data used for training the model encompass observations obtained under random control inputs. We assume that we do not have any trajectory data under an effective control policy. Without such data formulating supervised learning methods becomes challenging. We would appreciate additional elaboration on this comment, as it would help us understand the feasibility of employing supervised learning. \n\n**Q3. In the integration, it should be t instead of $t_i$?**\n\n**A3.** Yes, it should be $t$. Thank you for pointing out the error."

The paper mainly focuses on a new reduced-order approach (DeepROM) to model the system\u2019s dynamics and adopts an existing method NI4C(Saha et al., 2021) to learn the control. Thus in the experiment, the original full-order NI4C should be compared, as an ablation study for DeepROM. However, in current experiments, only LQR controls are compared.**\n\n**A1.** Thank you for highlighting the importance of an ablation study, specifically comparing the original full-order NI4C method with our proposed reduced-order approach. We recognize the significance of this comparison in evaluating the efficacy of our method. We have added a comparison with full-order NI4C in the revised paper for the fluid flow experiment. While the full-order model (FOM) trained for NI4C exhibits superior prediction accuracy for the initial steps, it experiences a rapid decline in accuracy over time. In contrast, DeepROM provides accurate predictions for a much longer period of time. On the other hand, FOM + NI4C shows better performance for the control task. However, it is crucial to highlight that the advantage of employing a reduced-order model over a full-order model in control learning primarily resides in reduced computational complexity without a substantial compromise in accuracy. Effective FLOP count (#E-FLOPs) per training or prediction step for FOM is significantly higher (over 150X) than that of DeepROM despite a similar parameter count. The substantial computational disparity arises due to the NI4C\u2019s requirement for a continuous-time formulation of the model, necessitating numerical integration during both training and inference. \n\n|Model| |#Params |#FLOPs| NFE| #E-FLOPs|\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|FOM ||76.93K| 22.34M| 42.83| 956.80M|\n||Encoder| 23.11K| 1.17M | N/A| |\n|DeepROM|ROM| 22.91K |34.00K |13.13 |6.11M\n||Decoder| 23.11K| 4.49M |N/A|\n\nNFE: Avg. number of function evaluations by the numerical integrator\n\n#E-FLOPs(FOM) = #FLOPs(FOM) \u00d7 NFE(FOM)\n\n#E-FLOPs(DeepROM) = #FLOPs(Enc) + #FLOPs(Dec) + #FLOPs(ROM) \u00d7 NFE(ROM)\n\n\n**Q2. Insignificant performance improvement. The performance of the DeepROC on the vortex-shedding task seems to be worse than LQR baselines (Figure 3(b,c)). The overall idea of reduced-order control is not new, thus the performance improvement is an important measure of contribution.**\n\n**A2.** We acknowledge your concern regarding the observed performance of DeepROC on the vortex-shedding task compared to LQR baselines. We recognize that performance improvement would undoubtedly strengthen the contribution.  We explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the conclusion section.\n\nIt is essential to clarify that our paper does not claim novelty in the general idea of reduced-order control. Instead, our focus was on establishing a theoretical connection between a traditional approach and the emerging deep learning-based methods for the control of dynamical systems. \n\n\n**Q3. Lack of higher dimensional and more complex datasets. In the abstract, the authors state that: \"Controlling complex PDEs often necessitates dimensionality reduction for computational efficiency.\" However, the experiments are about 1D reaction-diffusion and 2D N-S(with low Re). Such systems can be learned and predicted efficiently via full-order neural networks, such as simple FNN, DeepONet, FNO, PINN, and their variants. More complex datasets, such as 2D/3D N-S with turbulence or shock are needed to show the necessity of reduced-order models.**\n\n**A3.** We agree that several existing DNN-based full-order models can efficiently predict the evolution of systems that we considered in this paper. However, many of these models are not straightforwardly applicable to systems with dynamic control inputs. Furthermore, learning control through a DNN-based full-order model is computationally expensive. Existing methods either optimize for static control inputs using backpropagation through the learned model or employ model predictive control to learn dynamic inputs. With full-order models, such optimizations with long trajectory rollouts are computationally expensive. For example, the FLOP count for $T$-step rollout for FNO is much higher than that of a discrete-time version of DeepROM for a large $T$. \n\n|Model| |#Params |#FLOPs| #FLOPs for $T$-step rollout|\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|FNO||926.85K| 8.37M| $(8.37 \\times T)$M| \n||Encoder| 23.11K| 1.17M ||\n|DeepROM|ROM| 11.20K| 11.00K| $(5.66 + 0.011 \\times T)$ M| \n||Decoder| 23.11K| 4.49M ||\n\n**Q4. How to choose tunable hyperparameter $\\beta_{1,2,3}$?**\n\n**A4.** $\\beta_{1,2}$ were chosen from a set of values by evaluating the prediction and reconstruction losses on a validation set. $\\beta_3$ is chosen from a set of values by monitoring the Lyapunov energy along the trajectory of the ROM, under the learned policy."

For controlling PDEs, it may be important to compare with other classes of baselines, including backpropagation + surrogate model (e.g., [1]), RL-based (e.g., [2]), and predictor + controller methods (e.g., [3]). These are not required, but a more diverse comparison could strengthen the paper as a strong method within the field of PDE control.**\n\n**A1.** We appreciate your suggestion on incorporating diverse comparisons to strengthen the paper. The authors of [1] used backpropagation to optimize the control input of a trained surrogate model through backpropagation, which works well for time-independent PDEs. However, such optimization requires extensive memory and computational resources for time-dependent PDEs when the trajectory is very long, similar to the experiments we used in this paper. For our 1D reaction-diffusion experiment, it is feasible to use this method given the small size of the surrogate model and the low control dimension. However, in experiment, we observed that we can optimize the control input only up to a certain time step. Though the system state reaches the target within this timeframe, it fails to stay stable since the target is an unstable equilibrium and the control input is no longer effective. We have added this result in the supplementary of the revised paper.  \n\nAs mentioned in [1], RL-based methods (e.g., [2]) require a large number of interactions with the environment and often require system-specific reward functions (e.g., lift and drag of the flow in [2]). In this paper, we investigate a generic scenario and utilize standard distance-based metrics computed from raw states, rather than relying on system-specific rewards or loss functions. Training an RL policy in such a setting is extremely challenging.  Furthermore, RL methods require running numerical solvers in every iteration to provide feedback to the agents, which is computationally expensive. The same concern arises for the methods involving differentiable simulators (e.g., [3]). We agree that it would be interesting to understand the advantages of using a reduced-order model over RL-based methods, particularly without relying on system-specific rewards. We aim to investigate this aspect in future work, focusing on parameters such as training time, sample complexity, and overall performance. \n\n\n**Q2. There are many neural PDE methods that model the PDE using learned reduced-order models (albeit without control), and may have connections to the proposed method, e.g., [4-8]. The authors are encouraged to state their similarities and differences in the related works section.** \n\n**A2.** Thank you for bringing attention to relevant neural PDE methods. We have added similarities and differences with these methods in the related works section. \n\nIn [4] and [6], the authors combined encoder-decoder with recurrent networks in latent space to accelerate long-range simulation. The authors of [5] used an autoencoder with a latent evolution model, similar to ours; however, they considered inverse optimization only for static parameters. The authors of [7] used the learned latent representation from an autoencoder to form the trial basis for solving known PDEs using the Galerkin method. In [8], the authors introduced a generative autoencoder with a latent space dynamic model to generate realistic fluid simulation from latent parameters."
