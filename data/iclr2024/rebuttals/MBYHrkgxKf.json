While the paper offers an assessment of MLLMs' performance across benchmarks (encompassing abstract pattern reasoning, human activity prediction, and physical interaction prediction), it does not delve deeply into the specific types of errors these models tend to make. A more granular insight into the exact nature of the mistakes that MLLMs are prone to would have been invaluable.\n\n2. The study could benefit from a comprehensive examination of the impact of MLLMs' scale, particularly concerning their emergent ability to predict forthcoming events based on contextual cues. A more detailed exploration of the kinds of errors that MLLMs are vulnerable to, and how these inaccuracies might be reduced with the model's scaling (ranging from 7B to 13B models like Vicuna and InstructBLIP, and further expanding to ~1700B as in GPT4-Vision), would augment the depth of the analysis.\n\n3. The paper lacks of discourse on the potential advantages of pretraining MLLMs' vision modules on video datasets. Such pretraining could equip MLLMs with a better grasp of world dynamics, thereby enhancing their predictive capabilities in anticipating upcoming events based on context. This could be especially potent when contrasted with MLLMs whose vision modules have only been pretrained on static image datasets."

                    "value": "The authors propose a benchmark to assess the predictive reasoning ability of the current large language models. Specifically, they look at abstract pattern reasoning, human activity prediction, and physical interaction prediction tasks. They find that there is a substantial gap between the current models and upper bounds on these datasets. Interestingly, they find that the image models outperforms the video models for many of the tasks too. Despite being a good problem to address, the paper is not well-written and motivated which makes it difficult to buy in its current state. \n\n\nComments:\n\n- I agree that predictive reasoning is an important skill for AI systems to have. However, why should one expect multimodal LLMs which are not explicitly trained for predictive reasoning to be good at these? The current introduction does not convince me how and why people would want to use single-image MLLMs for multiple image sequence tasks. \n- In Section 2.2.1, the paper makes an incorrect claim that there has been no prior work on evaluating MLLM\u2019s ability to predict over sequential visual input. I point that [1,2] include multiple-images in their work. Even if we ignore these works, there have been several datasets including Robust Change Captioning, NLVR2, ImageCoDE, .. IconQA (Table 5 of [1]) which does multi-image evaluation of AI models. The paper ignores all this prior work and overestimates its novelty. I clarify that these datasets are different from video input based works mentioned in Section 2.2. I fail to understand why we should care about the new dataset proposed in the paper given the existing multi-image datasets.\n- How is Abstract Reasoning Patterns task different from IconQa examples? https://iconqa.github.io/explore.html\n- Action recognition is a classic video task and there are existing datasets for it such as Kinetics-400.\n- Section 3.2 is poorly written which makes it hard to understand how the model evaluation is done. Specifically, what is the choice of g? Most of the equations 1-6 seem unnecessarily complicated. I think they can be compressed to be more coherent.\n- The paper proposes many new metrics but lacks grounding with human evaluation. Do the humans score the models on the Specificity as their method does? How noisy is the metric?\n- Given LLaVA performs the best, I would have liked to see any analysis on the LlaVA instruction dataset. How many instructions in its dataset enforce approximate predictive reasoning?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06595.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14178.pdf"
