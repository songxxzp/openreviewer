A new algorithm, Pruning-Refinement-Identification (PRI), is proposed, leveraging a newly discovered structural property of CMDPs named limited stochasticity. PRI ensures near-optimal policy output with a high probability and guarantees improved regret and constraint violation bounds in the tabular setting."

Technically, this works seems a combination of Triple-Q with additional policy fine-tuning. It would be great to highlight the technical novelty. In particular, I wonder whether PRI can be used together with any online RL algorithm for CMDP with sublinear regret and constraint violation.\n\n3.

Can you replace Triple-Q with any efficient CMDP algorithm as long as the regret and constraint violation are sublinear? Suppose the regret is $K^{\\alpha}$ and constraint violation is $K^{\\beta}$. What would be the error in learning the policy? I am asking because it seems that the proof of Theorem 3 only requires some regret and constraint violation results."

Our responses to your answers can be found below. \n\n**Weakness 1 and Q1.** Assumption 2 and 5 means when the policy deviates from the optimal policy, then either the reward value function or the utility value function, or both should also deviate from those under the optimal policy.  We believe this is a reasonable assumption and should hold for most CMDPs. \n\n**Weakness 2 and Q4.** As the reviewer correctly pointed out that the results of this paper hold when we replace Triple-Q with any online, model-free CMDP algorithm with sublinear regret and constraint violation.  PRI can be viewed as a ``meta-algorithm'' that builds on any model-free CMDP algorithm with sublinear regret and constraint violation to achieve  $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{K})$ regret and constraint violation and to output a single stochastic policy. \n\n**Weakness 3.** For the synthetic CMDP simulation result, we indeed show that the algorithm finds a policy with cumulative reward 1.57301 and cumulative utility 2.00008. The cumulative reward and cumulative utility under the optimal solution are 1.57306 and 2, respectively. This comparison is given at the beginning of page 9. We will further highlight it in the revision. \n\n**Q2.** The uniqueness is needed so that after the pruning phases, all stochastic decisions of the optimal policy are correctly identified. We note that this assumption is not needed and is relaxed in Section 6. We present this special case phase first for readability. Focusing on the special case\nwhere the problem has a unique optimal solution allows us to explain the key ideas behind the\nalgorithm and makes the analysis easier to follow. \n\n**Q3.** The algorithm outputs a near-optimal solution. We will clarify this in the revision."

Assumptions 2 and 5 not only mean that reward value function deviates from that of the optimal policy. It moreover suggests that the deviation should be lower bounded by the TV distance. This seems a very strong assumption and I cannot think of any MDP model that might satisfy this. Of course, bandit models satisfy these assumptions. It would be great if the authors could rigorously verify this assumption on some CMDP examples."

                        "value": "Sorry for the confusion. We hope this reply can help you better understand the assumption we make.\nFor any value function, according to the definition of occupancy measure, we have $$V^{\\pi} = \\sum_{h,x,a} r_h(x,a) q_h(x,a) = \\mathbf{r} \\cdot \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}$$\nThe assumption requires there should exist such $c_v$ that\n$$V^* - V^{\\pi} = \\mathbf{r} \\cdot (\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}) \\geq c_v||\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}||$$ $V$ is a linear function of $q$ with a deviation vector $\\mathbf{r}$. That means the deviation for every specific direction must be a constant. Besides, with the limitation of constraints and legal transitions, the direction is restricted, which offers a minimum deviation. We assume the lower bound as $c_v$.\nFor example, considering a MDP problem with $H=2, S=2, A=2$. Without loss of generality we only consider MDP while CMDP is the same. Suppose the reward function is: $r_1(1,1) = 1, r_1(1,2) = 2, r_1(2,1) = 1, r_1(2,2) = 2, r_2(1,1) = 1, r_2(1,2) = 2, r_2(2,1) = 1, r_2(2,2) = 2$. No matter what the transition kernel is, the optimal policy should always choose action 2 at any state at any step. Consider an occupancy measure $q_h^{\\pi}(x,a)$ of any policy $\\pi$,\n$$V^* - V^{\\pi} = [\\sum_{h,x} q_h^*(x,1) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,1)] + [\\sum_{h,x} 2(q_h^*(x,2) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,2))] = -0.5 ||\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}|| + ||\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}|| = 0.5 ||\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}||$$\nFor\n$$\\sum_{h,x} q_h^*(x,1) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,1) + \\sum_{h,x} q_h^*(x,2) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,2) = 0$$\nand\n$$|\\sum_{h,x} q_h^*(x,1) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,1)| + |\\sum_{h,x} q_h^*(x,2) - q_h^{\\pi}(x,2)| = ||\\mathbf{q^*} - \\mathbf{q^{\\pi}}||.$$\nAs long as $c_v \\leq 0.5$, this MDP problem satisfies the assumption.\nOn the other hand, actually we can relax the TV distance as $||q^* - q||_{\\infty}$ and the proof will still hold. We hope this response can address your concern!"

An average reward CMDP can be transformed into an episodic CMDP by substituting $T=HK$ and augmenting a time index modulo $H$ in the state description. Therefore, Table 1 should also include the equivalent results obtained from the average reward CMDP literature.\n\n2. It is not clear from the related works if the model-free best policy identification (BPI) approach has been considered in the literature solely for unconstrained MDP. If yes, then the best regret bound in that category should be pointed out.\n\n3. The term $M$ in Lemma 2 has not been explicitly defined. \n\n4. There should be a policy initialization in Algorithm 1.\n\n5. Please use a different notation for the coefficients in $(11)$. The current one is similar to the notation of an action.\n\n6. It seems that the number of optimization variables in $(11)$ is $\\mathcal{O}(A^{SH})$ which could make the problem prohibitive for a large state space. This should be clearly stated in the paper.\n\n7. Assumption 1 indicates that the design of the algorithm requires knowledge about the optimal occupancy measure which is highly unlikely in practice.\n\n8. It seems that Assumption 2 is redundant for finite state and action spaces.\n\n9. The policy identification stage is run for $\\mathcal{O}(MKH)$ number of steps and as stated before, $M$, in the worst-case can be $\\mathcal{O}(A^{SH})$. Why this bound does not appear in the final regret should be intuitively explained.\n\n10. Theorem 3 dictates the BPI result assuming perfect pruning which does not happen with at most $\\mathcal{O}(K^{-0.1})$ probability. In the introduction, this probability is mentioned to be $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$. Please clarify."

We will add the discussion on its connection to average reward CMDPs.\n\n**Q2.** Most BPI algorithms for MDPs are model-based. Exisitng model-free BPI algorithms output a mixed policy that chooses one policy from all $K$ used policy uniformly at random instead of a single stochastic policy. We will add a discussion to the related work. \n\n**Q3.** $M$ is the same as the $M_q$ defined on page 4. We will clarify this in the revision. \n\n**Q4.** Sorry for the confusion. The policy initialization is the same as that of Triple-Q. We will clarify this in the revision. \n\n**Q5.** Good point! We will change it to $\\alpha_m$ in the revision.\n\n**Q6.** The number of optimization variables is $M,$ the number of greedy policies after the pruning phase. $M$ is upper bounded by $2^N,$ where $N$ is the number of constraints. We will clarify this in the revision. \n\n**Q7.** In practice, we choose small $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon'$ to use. When the assumption does not hold, the algorithm cannot provide the performance guarantees in the paper.  \n\n**Q8.** Can you please elaborate? It is not clear to us if the assumption automatically holds for finite state and action spaces. \n\n**Q9.** $M$ is bounded by $2^N,$ where $N$ is the number of constraints. Also, $\\sum_{i=1}^M a_i = 1$ so the policy identification stage includes $K$ episodes.\n\n**Q10.** Sorry for the typo. It should be $O(K^{-0.1})$ in the introduction as well."

We will add the review of Triple-Q in the revision. \n\n**Q1**. It is a constant a constant for constraint $n,$ not the exponential. We will use $(n)$ in the revision to avoid this confusion. This paper the subscripts are related to time (step index, episode index, etc) so we feel it is better to superscript as the constraint index. \n\n**Q2**. When $K$ is unknown, we may use the standard doubling trick, i.e., running the algorithm by increasing the assumed horizon from $T$, $2T,$ to $4T,$ $\\cdots$ until the process ends.  \n\n**Q3**. Yes, the reviewer is correct that Triple-Q is conservative and aims at achieving zero constraint violation, so it has smaller negative constraint violation. While the conservativeness reduces under Triple-Q, the plot shows the total constraint violation so it continues to decreases. We did not count the number of episodes where the constraint is violated because the constraint violation is defined on the utility-value function, which is the expected total utility, averaged over many episodes."

Indeed, [Efroni et al., 2020]  model-based methods, achieves optimal sublinear violation when the cancellations between episodes are not possible. \n2) The algorithm strongly relies on the Triple-Q algorithm, employing it as subroutine. Thus, the algorithmic novelty is partial.\n3) The assumption that the CMDP\u2019s LP has a unique solution is strong. Since it is relaxed in the second part of the paper, I do not see any reason to focus half of the paper on this case. Same reasoning holds for assumption 3. \n4) The theoretical results hold only for Large K, while no guarantees are provided if the number of episodes is small.\n5) In chapter 6, when the assumption on unique solution is relaxed, the authors introduce additional strong assumptions. For example, Assumption 4 states that the algorithm is given as input a lower bound on the probability of visiting every state-action pairs (when it is not 0) under the optimal policies belonging to the extreme point of the decision space.\n6) Given that the main novelty of the paper concerns the model-free nature of the algorithm (indeed, model-based algorithms achieves better theoretical guarantees), the authors should devote more space clarifying which is the improvement in terms of the computational complexity of the algorithm proposed with respect to prior works."

                        "value": "Response:\n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewer for the great comments and questions. Please see our detailed responses below. We believe we have addressed/clarified your concerns/questions. Please let us know if you have any further comments. We would also greatly appreciate if you could reevaluate the rating based on our response. Thanks! \n\n**Weakness 1**: We thank the reviewer for this comment. While the constraint violation defined in the paper allows the cancellation across episodes, we can guarantee $O(\\sqrt{K}\\log K)$ violation when the cancellation is not allowed by making some minor modification to the algorithm. In particular, in the policy refinement and identification phases, instead of using the $M$ greedy policy in a round-robin fashion, we can use a mixed policy that chooses policy $m$ with probability $a_m.$ With that modification, we will have\n* The Pruning phase consists at most $\\sqrt{K}$ episodes, so resulting in at most $O(\\sqrt{K})$ violation. \n* During the refinement phase, based on the result on page 16 of the supplemental material (Inequality (27)), we have with a high probability that the mixed policy used in the $t$th iteration has a regret bounded by $O(\\frac{\\log K}{(t-1)\\sqrt{K}})$ for $t\\geq 2.$ The same result holds for constraint violation, i.e., with a high probability, the constraint violation of the policy used in the $t$th iteration is bounded by  $O(\\frac{\\log K}{(t-1)\\sqrt{K}}).$ The $t$th iteration includes $\\sqrt{K}$ episodes and the refinement phase includes $\\sqrt{K}$ iterations. Therefore, with a high probability, the total violation without canceling across episodes is $O(\\sqrt{K}\\log K).$\n* The mixed policy used in the policy identification phase has a constraint violation bound of $O(\\frac{\\log K}{\\sqrt{K}}).$ The policy is used for $K$ episodes, so the violation is bounded by   $O(\\sqrt{K}{\\log K}).$\n\nTherefore, the total violation is bounded by $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{K})$ by using definition (5) in [Efroni et al., 2020]. We will add this in the revision.  \n\n**Weakness 2**. Our results hold if we replace Triple-Q with any model-free algorithm for CMDPs with sublinear regret and sublinear constraint violation. PRI can be viewed as a ``meta-algorithm'' that builds on any model-free CMDP algorithm with sublinear regret and constraint violation to achieve  $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{K})$ regret and constraint violation and to output a single stochastic policy.  \n\n**Weakness 3**. We present the special case phase first for readability. Focusing on the special case where the problem has a unique optimal solution allows us to explain the key ideas behind the algorithm and makes the analysis easier to follow. We can directly present the general case as the reviewer suggested, but it will not save much space because the results we established for the single-solution case are used for the multi-solution case. Therefore, there is minimal repetition in the current structure. \n\n**Weakness 4**. The reviewer is correct that the result holds only for large $K.$ It is common that regret bounds in bandits and reinforcement learning hold only for large $K.$ Note that order-wise results such as $O(\\sqrt{K})$ means it holds when $K$ is sufficiently. Big O notation defines the limiting behavior, i.e. when $K$ goes to infinity. \n\n**Weakness 5**.  Assumption 4 is similar to Assumption 1. It states that if a state-action pair is visited under an optimal policy, then the visiting probability is lower bounded. We believe it is a reasonable assumption and easy to satisfy for problems with finite state and action spaces. \n\n**Weakness 6**. Thanks for the suggestion! Model-free algorithms require a memory complexity of $O(HSA)$ for maintaining the Q-Table  while model-based algorithms require a memory complexity of $O(HS^2A)$ for maintaining all transition probabilities. This is the main advantage of using model-free algorithms in practice. We will clarify this in the revision. \n\n**Question about Slater's condition**. Yes, the reviewer is correct. We will clarify this in the revision."
