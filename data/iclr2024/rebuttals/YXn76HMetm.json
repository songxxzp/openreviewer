                    "value": "This paper propose to use the hyperbolic radius of each sample as selection criterion for active learning under domain shift. Specifically, they assume a hyperbolic image segmenter pretrained on the source domain. The segmenter is used to extract feature embedding for each pixel in the target domain, which is then projected to the hyperbolic space to compute the hyperbolic radius. The hyperbolic radius is then combined with entropy to select pixels for annotation. The proposed method is evaluated on several well-established domain adaptation settings for semantic segmentation, including GTAV\u2192Cityscapes, SYNTHIA \u2192 Cityscapes, and Cityscapes \u2192 ACDC, and shown to outperform others."

Actually, as the two aspects of class complexity considered in the paper, i.e., class difficulty and scarcity, are correlated by itself, the hyperbolic radius may be mostly affected by label scarcity. The coefficient factor (-0.605 vs. -0.899) also indicates that the hyperbolic radius is more correlated with label scarcity. More convincing support (i.e., theoretical analysis, more experimental evidence) for the correlation between hyperbolic radius and class complexity is needed.\n2. The writing needs to be improved, some sentences are broken, e.g., \"So more difficult classes such as pole which have lower accuracy, also have the larger Riemannian variance, so the largest effective volume available.\" (available is not a verb), \"Atigh et al.

The authors introduce a hyperbolic neural network method and a geometric interpretation of hyperbolic geometry derived from data statistics. In their approach, the hyperbolic radius represents an estimator of unexplained class complexity, which combines class intrinsic complexity and dataset scarcity. This complexity metric is used to identify the most informative pixels for annotation by considering both prediction uncertainty and class complexity. The approach is evaluated on several benchmarks and HALO achieves a new state-of-the-art in active learning for semantic segmentation, outperforming supervised domain adaptation with only 1% of labeled data."

How to plot the Figure 2? How to get the accuracy in Figure 2? \n- setting a new state-of-the-art across \" all ADA benchmarks for SS\" is overclaimed.\n- This is not correct: \"Hyperbolic neural networks first extract a feature vector v in Euclidean space\". Not necessary in Euclidean space (Fully HNN). \n- The conclusion seems problematic: We conclude that the hyperbolic radius indicates the difficulty in recognizing a class, as a consequence of the class complexity and its label scarcity.  Like in the previous papers, the hard pixels are more relative to their locations, like pixels on the boundary, even though there are lots of pixels in the dataset for such a category."

Then what should be the most informative ones? I ask because seems that the 'acquisition map' also indicates boundaries are the most informative ones?\n- How can you ensure that the hyperbolic NN is measuring the scarcity of labels for certain class prototypical appearances and the intrinsic complexity of classes? As you know the uncertainty will also lead to such a state.\n- How to make sure the manually defined class hierarchies are reliable? Why not learn from the data?\n- It seems this is not true from Figure 2 left:  classes with larger hyperbolic radii have lower performance and are likely more difficult to recognize, and more complex.

For example, in Figure 3 and Figure 4, all the indexes ((a), (b), (c)...) are not marked on the Figures correspondingly. In text, the Figure is indicated by both Figure and Fig., which should be unified as the same. The authors are suggested to check the paper writing.\n\n2. At the beginning of the Section 4.1, the authors claim that \"Fig. 2a illustrates the correlation between the perclass average hyperbolic radius and the relative class SS accuracy.\". However, the correlation between class accuracy and the class  average radius is not very obvious when acc < 0.8, the authors are suggested to add more analyses according to different accuracy ranges. More detailed analysis is suggested to be added. More analysis should be given for the Region- Vs. Pixel-based criteria part.\n\n3. The authors are suggested to have a discussion regarding the number of the parameters of the proposed method with the leveraged baselines.  \n\n4. In Figure 8, the authors only provided the predictions of the proposed method,  the predictions from the baselines are also interesting to deliver more comparison with the proposed method.\n\n5. In Section 5.3, the authors claim that \"However, these approaches often yield suboptimal or comparable performances when compared to the Euclidean counterpart. \". Will it be possible to provide quantitative comparison between these approaches ((Guo et al., 2022; Franco et al., 2023; van Spengler et al., 2023)) and the HFR? \n\n6. The method uses softmax score to serve as uncertainty. However, in model calibration field, pure softmax can barely estimate a good uncertainty score of the model without any open-set techniques, e.g., Monte-Carlo Dropout, OpenMax, Deep evidential learning,..., will the unsatisfied uncertainty prediction from the softmax score limit the performance of the proposed method? More discussion is expected toward this concern."
