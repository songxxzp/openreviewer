It highlights a previously unnoticed privacy risk where a semi-honest server could potentially learn clients' private models from shared logits. The paper introduces an attack called Adaptive Model Stealing Attack (AdaMSA) and proposes a defense strategy to mitigate this risk. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the attack and defense strategy."

                    "value": "Q1: The motivation of this article requires further justification by providing additional evidence. The authors mentioned that logit-based FL was developed to achieve communication-efficient FL. However, this is not a mainstream FL framework nor a mainstream communication-efficient FL framework. For example, asynchronous FL, gradient compression-based FL, gradient quantization-based FL, and generative learning-based one-shot FL are all widely adopted. Therefore, the reviewer's first concern is whether it is necessary and valuable to analyze the privacy risks of logit-based FL.\n\nQ2: The objectives of the adversary's attack warrant further examination. While the paper articulates the adversary's aim as acquiring the private model \u03b8, it is imperative to delve deeper into whether this private model \u03b8 can be subsequently leveraged for malicious purposes. It is worth noting that previous works in the field of privacy attacks primarily focus on the exfiltration of a client's confidential data. Consequently, a critical concern arises: can the adversary utilize the private model \u03b8 to reverse-engineer the original training data? This crucial aspect of the adversary's capabilities necessitates thorough investigation and discussion to assess the potential privacy risks associated with the acquired private model.\n\nQ3: More advanced baselines need to be included to highlight the superiority of the proposed privacy attacks. Considering that FL was proposed in 2016 and the baseline scheme compared in this article was also proposed in 2016, whether this scheme is representative still needs to be discussed. It would be better if the authors could consider more baseline solutions (such as [1]).\n\n[1] Takahashi H, Liu J, Liu Y. Breaching FedMD: Image Recovery via Paired-Logits Inversion Attack[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023: 12198-12207.\n\nQ4: There is merit in exploring additional, perhaps more straightforward, security mechanisms to corroborate and strengthen the privacy assurances of logit-based Federated Learning (FL). It is essential to recognize that the fundamental premise underpinning the attacks in this article hinges on the server's ability to access the logits uploaded by the client. However, it is possible to mitigate this vulnerability through the implementation of secure aggregation techniques and the utilization of hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). These measures can effectively safeguard against the server's unauthorized access to logits. It is pertinent to acknowledge that these considerations do not diminish the innovative contributions of the article. Nevertheless, it would be advantageous for the authors to engage in a discourse on these potential defense mechanisms to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the robustness of logit-based FL with respect to privacy concerns."

Consequently, a critical concern arises: can the adversary utilize the private model $\\theta$ to reverse-engineer the original training data? This crucial aspect of the adversary's capabilities necessitates thorough investigation and discussion to assess the potential privacy risks associated with the acquired private model.\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2018s thoughtful consideration of the adversary\u2019s objectives, particularly regarding the potential malicious use of the acquired private model $\\theta$. \nIn our initial exploration of the potential privacy risks in logit-based FL, our primary emphasis is on treating the private model itself as the privacy element and our focus centers on the identification and quantification of risks associated with the private model. In both the introduction and Appendix F, we have discussed this potential direction as a promising avenue for future work.\nWe also want to underscore that compromising the privacy of logit-based FL is nontrivial, given that the only knowledge available to a semi-honest adversary is the victim's logits on the public dataset. This limitation is a critical aspect of our study, and we appreciate the opportunity to clarify our current focus and future directions.\n\n**Weakness 3 and Question 3:**  \n>Limited in-depth comparison with state-of-the-art solutions.\n>More advanced baselines need to be included to highlight the superiority of the proposed privacy attacks. Considering that FL was proposed in 2016 and the baseline scheme compared in this article was also proposed in 2016, whether this scheme is representative still needs to be discussed. It would be better if the authors could consider more baseline solutions (such as [1]).\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2018s valuable suggestion to incorporate more advanced baselines in order to highlight the superiority of our proposed privacy attacks. In the context of logit-based FL, we do recognize the presence of numerous variants (as explained in *General Response 2*). However, it's noteworthy that these variants can be seen as combinations of parameter-based and logit-based FL, thereby leading to privacy issues similar to those encountered in parameter-based FL.\n\nRegarding the comparison with the baseline solution mentioned in [1], we are thankful to the reviewer for bringing our attention to this contemporary work. It is important to clarify a key difference between our study and [1]. The tasks undertaken in the two works differ significantly. [1] focuses on reconstructing class representation of private data, which is comparatively much easier than recovering the original private data. As also highlighted in the Limitation section of [1], the attacker cannot directly obtain anything calculated from the private dataset, and reconstructing the exact image remains challenging in the context of logit-based FL. Moreover, we provide both theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risk in logit-based FL.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that our study and [1] are oriented towards different directions in exploring the privacy risks of logit-based FL. We believe that our work and [1] can be viewed as complementary efforts, as they contribute to an empirical understanding of privacy risks in logit-based FL that recovers private class representatives. A more effective attacking model, as proposed in our work, can be instrumental in reversing private class representations, thereby advancing the progression towards recovering the original private data."

I still have the following concerns that need to be further addressed:\n\n- Whether the Logit-based FL framework is representative is unclear. Although the authors cited literature [6\u20138] to support their claims, literature [6\u20138] is neither a mature industrial application nor a classic academic work. I remain concerned about the practicality of this article's research questions.\n\n- Regarding Q4, I think it is very common in industrial applications to sacrifice additional computing and storage resources to fully ensure user privacy. If the security and privacy attacks explored in this article can be avoided using TEEs, the authors would be wise to discuss and provide more insights into why the proposed attacks are not evaluated in the context of these security mechanisms.\n\nI look forward to responses from the authors!"

For a deeper understanding of the classic academic framework of logit-based FL, we recommend exploring two pioneering works: [1] (proposed in 2019, citation 565) and [2] (proposed in 2020, citation 596). It's crucial to recognize that logit-based FL is a relatively new framework, having emerged within the last four years. Despite its early stage of development, it demonstrates promise as an evolving research direction, as seen in the increasing number of papers related to \"Federated Learning\" and \"distillation\" on arXiv in recent years:\n\n| | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023|\n| :-:| :-:| :-:| :-:|:-: |:-: |\n|**Number of Paper** |5 | 22 | 15 | 57 | 82 |\n\nThe growth is propelled by the framework's potential to address several crucial challenges in FL, including efficiency, privacy, and model heterogeneity.\n\nIt's noteworthy that while parameter-based FL serves as a standard and well-established norm for cross-device federated learning, it encounters limitations in many real-world scenarios that demand model heterogeneity and high efficiency (e.g., edge computing, Internet of Vehicles, etc.). Furthermore, recent studies [3-4] have unveiled the possibility of reconstructing the original input from the shared parameters, thereby compromising the most important property of federated learning: privacy. This underscores the significance of exploring alternative frameworks like logit-based FL to better adapt to the complexities of diverse applications.\n\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Li, Daliang, and Junpu Wang. \"Fedmd: Heterogeneous federated learning via model distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.03581 (2019).  \n[2] Lin, Tao, et al. \"Ensemble distillation for robust model fusion in federated learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 2351-2363.\n[3] Zhu, Ligeng, Zhijian Liu, and Song Han. \"Deep leakage from gradients.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019).\n[4] Zhao, Bo, Konda Reddy Mopuri, and Hakan Bilen. \"idlg: Improved deep leakage from gradients.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.02610 (2020)."

                        "value": "**Weakness 1-2:**\n> The proposed method is impractical to be executed or evaluated in real-world scenarios.  \nThe privacy risk metric can not express the true privacy risk of the setting.\n\n**Response:**  \nIf we understand correctly, the concern raised about the impracticality of our proposed method revolves around two key aspects: 1) **the feasibility and practicality of constructing the mix dataset as the public dataset**, and 2) **the evaluation of the attacking model on the private test data as the privacy metric**. We appreciate the opportunity to address these concerns and provide additional context on the motivation behind our approach.\n\n- **The feasibility and practicality of constructing the mix dataset as the public dataset:**\n\nIn logit-based FL, the public dataset can either have the same distribution as the private dataset or a different distribution in an irrelevant domain. Recognizing that the correlation (i.e., distance) between the private and public datasets is crucial in determining the performance of logit-based FL methods, we want to first quantify and vary this correlation. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, few studies provide methods that can continuously vary the distance between two datasets. Therefore, we propose to construct a mix dataset as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). **We want to emphasis that, in our setting, the mix dataset is used as the public dataset in the standard logit-based FL setting [1].**\n\nConstructing the mix dataset allows us to systematically manipulate the correlation between the mix and private datasets, providing a controlled environment to evaluate the privacy risks in logit-based FL. While we acknowledge the complexity of constructing such a mix dataset, we believe it is a necessary step to better understand and quantify the privacy implications in logit-based FL.\n\n- **The evaluation of the attacking model on the private test data as the privacy metric:**\n\nWe would like to emphasize two critical points. Firstly, **the evaluation of the attacking model's performance occurs after the training phase**, ensuring that the adversary (i.e., server) does not have access to the private data during the model training process. The server remains unaware of the specifics of the private data throughout the training phase, which is also the exact phase that the attack and defense take place.\n\nSecondly, in our study, we identify the local model itself as the privacy element for the client that the adversary aims to attack and defend. To assess the success of the attack, we employ a widely adopted metric in model stealing attacks, which is **the functionality of the model** [2-4]. Specifically, we evaluate whether the attacking model can achieve high classification accuracy on the defender\u2019s classification task. This choice allows us to gauge the effectiveness of the attack in terms of replicating the functionality of the private model.\n\n**Weakness 3:**  \n>The notations are vague which makes it very hard to follow the analysis of the work.\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer's feedback regarding the vagueness of notations in our work, and we are committed to improving the clarity of our manuscript.\n\nTo address this concern effectively, we would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could point out specific instances of ambiguity in the notations. We have already taken note of questions 1-4 and clarify these points in the following response. If there are additional areas of confusion or if any specific notations require further clarification, please bring them to our attention, and we will make the necessary adjustments to enhance the clarity of our work.\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Li, Daliang, and Junpu Wang. \"Fedmd: Heterogenous federated learning via model distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.03581 (2019).  \n[2] Orekondy, Tribhuvanesh, Bernt Schiele, and Mario Fritz. \"Knockoff nets: Stealing functionality of black-box models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2019.  \n[3] Kariyappa, Sanjay, and Moinuddin K.

                        "value": "**Question 1:**  \n>Why does the accuracy on the private dataset express the success rate of the model stealing attack? What if the attack mode is very generalized which achieves high accuracy in the same data distribution?\n\n**Response:**  \nAs also mentioned in *Response to Weakness 1-2*, we identify the local model itself as the privacy element that we aim to attack and defend. To assess the success of the attack, we employ a widely adopted metric in model stealing attacks, which is the functionality of the model. Specifically, we evaluate whether the attacking model can achieve high classification accuracy on the defender\u2019s classification task.\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer's point regarding the possibility of a very generalized attack achieving high accuracy in the same data distribution. In response to this concern, we have conducted an ablation study in a non-iid setting, and the results are reported in *Response to Weakness 4 and Question 1* to Reviewer kvRw. Even in the non-iid setting, we observe that AdaMSA achieves similar performance compared to the victim model, indicating the effectiveness of our attack. \n\nThis analysis enhances the robustness of our evaluation for the attack performance, and we will incorporate these considerations into our revised manuscript.\n\n**Question 2:**  \n>Since $D_{pub}$ is unlabeled, how to quantify Eq. 1 for $D_{mix}$?\n\n**Response:**  \nOur focus is not on calculating $D_{mix}$ directly; rather, our objective is to derive the bound of the privacy risk, which is quantified by the performance of the attacking model. The bound we aim to obtain is independent of the ground truth label $f_p$. The unlabeled nature of $D_{pub}$ does not affect our ability to establish a meaningful privacy risk bound.\n\n**Question 3:**  \n>The construction of $D_{mix}$ is based on the empirical sets of $D_{priv}$ and $D_{pub}$. How does it reflect the true distribution of $D_{priv}$ and $D_{pub}$?\n\n**Response:**  \nOur primary objective is not to precisely replicate the true distribution but rather to systematically manipulate the correlation between the private and mix datasets. Creating such a controlled environment enables us to evaluate the impact of varying correlations on the privacy risks in logit-based Federated Learning (FL). While the constructed $D_{mix}$ may not precisely reflect the true distribution, it serves as a valuable tool for assessing the privacy risk of logit-based FL methods through changes in the correlation between public and private data.\n\nIn our revised manuscript, we will emphasize the purpose of our empirical construction of $D_{mix}$ and its role in providing insights into the sensitivity of logit-based FL methods to variations in correlation between private and public datasets. We appreciate the reviewer's consideration of this aspect and thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\n**Question 4:**  \n>Since the adversary cannot touch $D_{priv}$, how to construct $D_{mix}$?\n\n**Response:**  \nWe construct $D_{mix}$ with the aim of systematically manipulating the correlation between the private and public datasets. It's important to clarify that, in our setting, $D_{mix}$ functions as the public dataset in the standard logit-based FL setting [1]. In other words, all clients and the server possess the mix dataset as the unlabeled public data described in Section 3.1.\n\n**Question 5:**  \n>What is the difference between the theoretical analysis of the work compared to Blitzer et al., 2007?\n\n**Response:**  \nOur theoretical analysis is primarily based on the work by Blitzer et al., 2007. Our initial objective is to derive the bound of the privacy risk in our specific setting. We establish that this risk can be effectively measured by evaluating the performance of the attacking model. Subsequently, we derive the privacy bound based on the principles and findings from prior works.\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Li, Daliang, and Junpu Wang. \"Fedmd: Heterogenous federated learning via model distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.03581 (2019)."

The computational complexity of AdaMSA described in Algorithm 1 is $O(M|\\mathcal{D}_{pub}|)$. The additional computational complexity of proposed defense is $O(dim(p))$, where $dim(p)$ is the dimension of logit $p$.\n\nWe will add the computational complexity analysis in the Appendix B.\n\n**Weakness 2:**  \n> For the defense method, the approximation error of the proposed heuristic solver is not analyzed.\n\n**Response:**  \nWe are grateful for the reviewer\u2018s insightful comment regarding the absence of an analysis on the approximation error of the proposed heuristic solver for the defense method. In the current phase of our research, our primary emphasis has been on identifying and quantifying the privacy risk in logit-based FL. The experimental results of our proposed solver for the defense method represent the initial steps in addressing the optimization problem outlined in Eq. (6) and (7).\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer's observation and recognize the necessity for an enhanced solution to the optimization problem, including a thorough examination of the approximation error associated with the proposed heuristic solver. We value the importance of evaluating both the efficiency and accuracy of the solver as integral components of our ongoing work.\n\nThe reviewer's suggestion aligns with our commitment to refining and extending our research. In our latter revised manuscript, we will explicitly point out the need for an improved solver, considering both efficiency and accuracy, and highlight this as a specific avenue for future research. \n\n**Weakness 3:**  \n> The number of communication rounds of the experiments is small. It would be interesting to see whether the performance of the attack and the defense still hold with hundreds or thousands of communication rounds.  \n\n**Response:**  \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's comment regarding the number of communication rounds in our experiments. The consideration of the impact of communication rounds is indeed crucial for understanding the robustness and scalability of our proposed attack and defense methods.\n\nIn our experiments, we observed that the local models converge at approximately round 6-7 in the close-world setting and at round 20 in the open-world setting. Given these observations, we made a conscious decision to select 10 communication rounds for the close-world setting and 30 rounds for the open-world setting. These choices were made to capture the convergence points while maintaining a balance between computational efficiency and experimental completeness.\n\nFurthermore, we attempted to extend the training to 100 rounds in the open-world setting. However, we found that the performance showed only minor variations within a range of 1-2%. This indicates that, beyond a certain point, additional communication rounds did not significantly impact the observed results."

Why the importance weight is linearly dependent with $t$ (rather than exponential dependence for example)?\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer's questions regarding the determination of the threshold $T_0$ and the linearity of the importance weight $w_t$ in our proposed attack. Your insights prompt valuable clarifications that we aim to address in our revised manuscript.\n\nFor $T_0$, in the current paper, we have fixed $T_0$ as 3 to report the main results presented in Table 2. The choice of $T_0$ was made empirically based on observations in our experimental settings. We found that $T_0$ set to 3 yielded optimal results, striking a balance between the server's storage requirements for historical logits and the effectiveness of the attack. In our revised manuscript, we will provide additional context on this choice and discuss the impact of threshold $T_0$ in further detail, as outlined in Table 3.\n\nRegarding the linearity of the importance weight $w_t$, we have empirically observed that the adoption of a simple linear dependence for the importance weight $w_t$ yields effective results in our experiments. We appreciate the suggestion to add discussions on the impact of the hyperparameter setting. In our latter revised manuscript, we will explore potential implications of using different forms of dependence, such as exponential dependence.\n\n**Question 2:**  \n> How many federated clients are in the experiments?\n\n**Response:**  \nWe follow the setting in [1] and set the number of clients as 10 in our experiments.\n\n---\n\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Li, Daliang, and Junpu Wang. \"Fedmd: Heterogenous federated learning via model distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.03581 (2019)."

The proposed attacks improve by the previous baseline via a temporal weighted factor, making the attack an incremental improvement.\n\n**Response:**  \nThank you for your insightful comments regarding the technical depth of the proposed attack. While we acknowledge that our proposed AdaMSA can be seen as an incremental improvement of MSA, we would like to highlight a key aspect of our contribution. One of our primary objectives is to **identify and quantify the privacy risk in logit-based FL**. This task is nontrivial due to the unique characteristics of logit-based FL, where only logits on public dataset are available, and existing privacy attacks against FL fail to work, as demonstrated in Appendix A.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose a methodology that first steals the client\u2019s private model and then the stolen model is evaluated on the client\u2019s private test dataset to **provide a measurable privacy metric for logit-based FL**. Based on the unique characteristics of logit-based FL, we then propose AdaMSA, aiming to design a more informative attacking logit for the attacking model to learn from. We also provide a detailed comparison of the difference between existing MSA and our proposed attack in Section 2.2.\n\n**Weakness 3:**  \n> Only baseline (MSA) is too naive. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the tricks used in the proposed attack, I suggest adding more baselines\u2014for example, no threshold\u00a0$T_0$\u00a0or setting\u00a0$w_t=1$\u00a0in the proposed attacks.\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer's suggestion to include additional baselines to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the tricks used in the proposed attack. We value your feedback and would like to clarify our baselines in the paper.\n\nAs the first study to identify and quantify this privacy risk in logit-based FL, we chose to establish a baseline by employing a naive MSA modified with a threshold setting ($T_0=0$; $w_T=1$, otherwise 0). As presented in Table 2, the simplicity of this baseline allows for a clear comparison and understanding of the impact of our proposed attack.\n\nTo evaluate the impact of threshold T_0, we have discussed the impact of the threshold setting ($T_0$) in Table 3. We will add discussions on the impact of the hyperparameter setting $w_t$ in our latter revised manuscript."

We report the primary result in Openworld-CF setting to illustrate our observation. We observe that: 1) increasing the non-iid level (i.e. decrease $D$) will decrease the utility of local model as well as the attacking model performance; 2) AdaMSA achieves similar performance compared to the victim model, indicating AdaMSA is still effective in the non-iid setting.\n\n| **Defense** | $D=1.0$ | | $D=100$ |   |  \n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|  \n| | Victim | AdaMSA | Victim | AdaMSA |   \n| **Unprotected** |  $66.32\\pm0.79$ | $66.26\\pm1.05$ | $71.09\\pm1.21$ | $71.21\\pm0.99$ |  \n| **Cross-domain** | $49.04 \\pm 1.83$ | $49.11 \\pm 1.64$ | $54.24\\pm1.92$ |  $54.20\\pm1.65$|\n| **One-shot** | $57.30\\pm1.46$ | $57.42\\pm1.02$ | $63.06\\pm0.55$ | $63.25\\pm0.97$ |   \n| **DP-G** | $59.48\\pm1.55$ | $60.01\\pm0.87$ |  $65.88\\pm1.43$ | $66.89\\pm1.03$ |\n| **DP-L** | $59.38\\pm2.12$ | $59.90\\pm1.52$ | $65.59\\pm1.96$ | $65.99\\pm1.97$ |\n\nMore ablation experimental results on the influence of the non-iid setting will be included in the Appendix of later revised manuscript.\n\nFor **malicious client:** In this paper, our primary assumption is that clients are honest, and the server is semi-honest, as demonstrated in Table 1. We recognize that exploring other scenarios where the client is semi-honest or even malicious could provide valuable insights into the robustness and privacy of logit-based FL methods. Your suggestion raises an important aspect that we acknowledge and consider as a valuable direction for future work.\n\n**Question 1:**  \n> Is Adaptive attack possible in the presence of the attack knows the defense (e.g., obfuscate the logit with added noise)?\n\n**Response:**  \nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2018s insightful question regarding the adaptability of the attack in the presence of additional knowledge about the defense, particularly the use of obfuscating logits with added noise. This is indeed an interesting consideration that we would like to address. \n\nIn our current study, we make the assumption that the adversary only has knowledge of the victim\u2018s logits on public data. However, we acknowledge that if the adversary possesses additional knowledge, such as awareness of the defense method or even the type of noise added on the logits, it could potentially develop a more powerful attack by leveraging denoising techniques to reverse the input logits and against the obfuscation-based defense [2-3].\n\n---\n**Reference:**  \n[1] Hsu, Tzu-Ming Harry, Hang Qi, and Matthew Brown. \"Measuring the effects of non-identical data distribution for federated visual classification.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.06335 (2019).  \n[2] Balle, Borja, and Yu-Xiang Wang. \"Improving the gaussian mechanism for differential privacy: Analytical calibration and optimal denoising.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
