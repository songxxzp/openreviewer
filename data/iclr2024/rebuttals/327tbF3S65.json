(ICLR 2023). \n- A VAE approach for probabilistic INRs has been recently published by Koyuncu et al. (ICML 2023): \"Variational Mixture of HyperGenerators for Learning Distributions Over Functions.\" This paper is not even mentioned in the present work, and it is a must for the authors to include it, not only in the literature review but also in the experimental setting. Authors also consider using various hypergenerators to capture different data scales and modalities in that work.\n- I do not think the paper also compares with \"Implicit Diffusion Models for Continuous Super-Resolution\" (CVPR 2023), in terms of tools and results obtained. Comparisons with this paper are important too.\n- Using a generative latent diffusion model directly follows the idea of Rombach et al. (CVPR 2022).\n- Hierarchies of multi-scale PE have already been developed in the literature. The paper \"Composite Slice Transformer: An Efficient Transformer with Composition of Multi-Scale Multi-Range Attentions\" (ICLR 2023) is a good reference. \n\nWhile combining existing ideas into a robust model is not a demerit of the paper per se, the paper's contributions are limited. \n\nAlso, when explaining the interpolation and the basis functions, more details are needed since these concepts are hard to understand the way they are written."

[W1] **Lack of references & comparison with references.**\n    \n    We appreciate your reference to the recent papers that we have overlooked. We will include all the papers in the manuscript.\n    \n    - Regarding the paper ICML 2023.\n        \n        Indeed, their work also employs a VAE framework for modeling INRs and utilizes multiple hyper-generators to capture different aspects of signals. However, they still model the weight space of functions with fixed PEs, similar to previous generative models for INRs. \n        \n        In our paper, we have proposed generating PEs instead of generating weight space, and have quantitatively shown that it is more effective in generating high-fidelity signals. This is also supported by quantitative evidence presented in the table below, where our model outperforms the VaMoH approach in terms of signal fidelity on the CelebA 64x64 dataset.\n        \n        |  | CelebA 64x64 |\n        | --- | --- |\n        | VaMoH | 66.27 |\n        | Ours | 9.74 |\n    - Regarding the paper CVPR 2023.\n        \n        We want to stress that scale-free image generation demonstrated in our paper differs from the super-resolution task. (CVPR 2023) proposes a specialized model architecture and methodology tailored for super-resolution tasks, which cannot generate diverse images like ours. Therefore, it is not feasible to make a fair comparison with our work.\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n2. [W2] **More details regarding interpolation/basis functions.**\n    \n    We will improve the manuscript accordingly within the rebuttal period and notify you after the update.\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n3. [Q1] **Did you try to train a more powerful VAE latent space instead of training a latent diffusion model?**\n    \n    During the early stages of our research, we experimented with training more powerful VAEs, including hierarchical VAEs [A]. Nevertheless, we observed that even these advanced VAEs encounter challenges in producing high-quality INRs, primarily due to issues with the 'prior hole' phenomenon. This limitation was found to be less significant in latent diffusion models, which is why we pursued that direction.\n\n   ---\n   [A] Vahdat and Kautz, NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder, NeurIPS 2020\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n4. [Q2] **Posterior distribution used in D2C-VAE.**\n    \n    We assumed multivariate normal distribution for posterior $q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})$ in all domains.\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n5. [Q3] **Dimension of latent space.**\n    \n    The dimensions of the latent space $\\textbf{z}$ are detailed in the supplementary materials, specifically in Table 9. We found that reducing the dimensionality of the latent space compromises sample quality to some extent, but it also results in a more efficient computational budget. This trade-off is consistent with observations from LDMs [B].\n\n    ---\n    [B] Rombach et al., High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models, CVPR 2022"

Features projecting onto the same pixel are aggregated using average pooling, resulting in three distinct 2D grid features, each with the dimensionality `HxWxD`. \n        \n        Thus, the resulting 2D grids can be processed 2D CNN.

However, we favored occupancy functions over SDF for 3D INR due to the significant reduction in preprocessing time and dataset size. For instance, the SDF representation of the ShapeNetV2-chair dataset occupies roughly 620GB, whereas the occupancy function representation requires only about 12GB. Surprisingly, the results suggest that our method with occupancy functions yields shape quality that is comparable or superior to SDF-based methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This observation was consistent despite the inherent differences in the representations. \n    \n$\\\\\\\\$\n\n3. **[Q3] Code release**\n    \n    Of course, we will release our code in the final version."

                        "value": "Thank you for the reply which solved most of my concerns. I also read other reviews and the corresponding replies. Generally, I think this is a good paper because (1) it is the first work to model positional embeddings to generate INRs, (2) multi-scaled strategies are proposed to promote the performance, and (3) experiments are extensive, conducted in many domains and demonstrate superior performance. I'm considering increasing my rating in the reviewer discussion period.\n\nHowever, I still have some suggestions for this work.\n\n- Basically, the key contribution of this work is D2C-VAE, which provides a continuous positional embedding field for INRs. However, the paper prominently features latent diffusion models (LDM), even putting the term in the title, which appears that the emphasis is somewhat disproportionate. From the perspective of LDM, the contribution of this work is incremental, as it's just a direct application. In fact, any generative models can be applied to model the VAE latent space, as Dupont et. al (2022) did, using NSF and DDPM to model functa. Therefore, I recommend de-emphasizing LDM, and the authors could conduct experiments to elucidate the reasons for selecting LDM, instead of other generative models.\n\n- The main paper dedicates a substantial portion to introducing the preliminaries about VAE and diffusion models (Sec. 3.2), but leaves the details about the key contribution, i.e., D2C-VAE, to the appendix. It makes the paper hard to follow without checking the appendix."

In this paper, we proposed a new meta-architecture for generating INRs given discrete inputs. Our architecture uses a latent diffusion model in the latent space of an asymmetric VAE that learns a joint latent space that bridges discrete data to continuous functions. The LDM in our title/model name describes the overall architecture of the proposed method similar to other models\u2019 names in the literature [B,C,D].\n\n    Indeed, reviewer KC2J raised a great point that our contributions are not limited to diffusion models. Our main contributions (D2C-VAE, HDBFs, CFC) are definitely applicable to other generative models, such as Normalizing Flows and GANs. As suggested, we will provide additional experiments with other generative models other than latent diffusion models to demonstrate the extensionality of our contributions. \n\n    ---\n    [B] Liu et al., AudioLDM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Diffusion Models, ICML 2023\n\n    [C] Koo et al., SALAD: Part-Level Latent Diffusion for 3D Shape Generation and Manipulation, ICCV 2023\n\n    [D] Stan et al., LDM3D: Latent Diffusion Model for 3D, CVPRW 2023\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n- **Improving the presentation of D2C-VAE + $\\alpha$.**\n\n   As suggested, we have updated the manuscript (see sections 3.1, 3.2, 4, and Appendix A).

We will address the raised questions below.\n\n1. **[W1] Regarding the soundness of eq.(2).**\n\n    We would like to clarify the rationale behind our D2C-VAE. The objective of D2C-VAE is to maximize the ELBO of the log-likelihood of a continuous function $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ with the discrete data $\\textbf{x}$. It is articulated below based on the standard variational inference principles: $$ \\begin{align} \\log p(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})  & = \\log \\int p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}| \\mathbf{z}) \\cdot p(\\mathbf{z}) d\\mathbf{z} \\\\\\\\ & = \\log \\int \\frac{p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z})}{q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})} \\cdot q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot p(\\mathbf{z}) d\\mathbf{z} \\\\\\\\ & \\geq \\int \\log \\left(\\frac{p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z})}{q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})} \\cdot p(\\mathbf{z}) \\right) \\cdot q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) \\ d\\mathbf{z} \\\\\\\\ & = \\int q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) \\cdot \\left( \\log p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z}) - \\log \\left( \\frac{q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})}{p(\\mathbf{z})} \\right) \\right) \\\\\\\\ & = E_{q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x})}\\left[\\log p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z}) \\right] - D_{KL}(q_\\phi(\\mathbf{z}|\\mathbf{x}) || p(\\mathbf{z})) \\end{align} $$\n\n   where the inequality in the third line is by Jensen's inequality and the last line corresponds to Equation 2 in our paper. However, we do not have direct observations to $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$, while we have access to discrete data $\\textbf{x}=\\boldsymbol{\\omega}(\\mathbf{c})$, we approximate $p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z})$ as\n\n   $$\\begin{align}\n    p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}|\\mathbf{z}) & \\approx p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega(\\mathbf{c})}|\\mathbf{z})\n    \\\\\\\\\n    & = \\prod_{c \\in \\mathbf{c}} p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}(c)|\\mathbf{z}), \\end{align} $$ where we assume the coordinate-wise independence. This leads to the approximation in Equation 3 of our paper. Assuming the likelihood as a multivariate normal distribution with isotropic covariance ($\\sigma$),\n\n   $$\\begin{align}\n     p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega(\\mathbf{c})}|\\mathbf{z}) = \\prod_{c \\in \\mathbf{c}} p_{\\psi, \\pi_\\theta}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}(c)|\\mathbf{z}) =\\prod_{c \\in \\mathbf{c}} \\frac{1}{Z} \\exp \\left( - \\frac{||\\boldsymbol{\\omega}(c) - \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}(c)||^2_2}}{2\\sigma^2} \\right) \\end{align} $$  where $Z$ is a normalizing constant and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\omega}}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\pi_\\theta(\\gamma(\\textbf{c}, D_\\psi(\\mathbf{z})))$. We will update this in the appendix.\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n2. **[W2] Intuition behind PE generation instead of weight generation.**    \n   We will provide the intuition of PE generation. Recent INR studies in the literature have shown the significance of positional encoding (PE) to achieve **high-quality** representations. Parametric PEs, such as hash grids and orthogonal planes with **learnable** parameters [A,B,C], exhibit a superior expressive capacity compared to fixed PE (e.g., Fourier feature mappings [D]). Thus, we favor learning to generate PE over MLP weights based on the outstanding expressive power of parametric PEs. In EG3D [E], they have demonstrated the generation of high-fidelity 3D-aware 2D images by generating tri-plane PEs based on GAN.

It is the first work to combine the power of latent diffusion model with input adaptive positional embeddings for generating implicit neural representations.\n2. Same architecture is used for generating arbitrary continuous INRs using discrete inputs from various domains that includes images, videos, 3D shapes and NeRFs.\n3. Overall, better qualitative and quantitative results when compared to SoA discrete generative models, domain-specific INR generative models and domain-agnostic generative models.\n4.

                    "value": "1. Limited novelty. I see this work as a natural extension to other works on domain-agnostic LDMs for INRs such as Functa (Dupont et. al, 2022a) and DPF (Zhuang et. al, 2023). The only difference between DDMI and Functa is replacing dynamic MLP weights with dynamic positional embeddings. \n2. DDMI made three changes w.r.t. Functa -- dynamic MLP weights -> dynamic PEs, HDBFs, and CFC. It is still unclear how much improvement was achieved by making a shift from dynamic MLP to dynamic PEs. The ablation only covers the relative effects of HDFCs and CFC.\n3. Scalability -- The work claims that the prior works are not scalable as dynamically modifying MLP weights limit its expressive power. However, DDMI has not demonstrated any scalability. Most of the results are either on single or few class dataset, while the number of samples are in the order of 10K. Currently, it seems to me that semantic class specific INR generative model is being fit. True scalability to larger community is model's ability to generate high quality samples from diverse set of classes. Consider training on Objaverse scale of dataset.\n4. Significance -- Given that almost all high-fidelity LDM models are obtained by domain-specific LDMs, I fail to understand the real value behind creating domain-agnostic architecture. It make sense to anyone, if priors from multiple domains are reused which is possible only if DDMI was trained by sampling input discrete data across domains.\n5. Domain Agnostic ? It is not clear how the presented DDMI is domain-agnostic. I presume the input and output of LDMs will remain the same when trained for signals from each domain. However, the implementation details in appendix suggests that dataset-specific architecture was deployed with LDM input/output also changing likewise."

We will address the raised questions below.\n\n1. **[W1, W2] Limited novelty & why dynamic PE?**\n    \n    Recent INR studies in the literature have evidenced the significance of positional encoding (PE) to achieve **high-quality** representations. Parametric PEs, such as hash grids and orthogonal planes with **learnable** parameters [A,B,C], exhibit a superior expressive capacity compared to fixed PE (e.g., Fourier feature mappings [D]). \n\n    The outstanding expressive power of parametric PEs suggests a promising direction for generative models, favoring learning to generate PE over MLP weights. In [E], they have demonstrated the generation of high-fidelity 3D-aware 2D images by generating tri-plane PEs based on GAN. Unlike the prior work, we propose PE generation with the latent **diffusion model**, enhancing it by our novel modules such as **multi-resolution framework (HDBF)** and **coarse-to-fine conditioning (CFC)**.\n\n    Indeed, at the early stage of this project, we developed a latent diffusion model for weight generation (with fixed PEs) with a hypernetwork to modulate the MLP weight of INR ($\\pi$) with latent from the Encoder. The weight generation model exhibited significantly slower convergence and failed to produce high-quality samples. Due to limited resources, we are not able to provide experimental results to compare weight vs PE generation (without HDBFs and CFC). We will add the comparison in the final version.\n\n    ---\n    \n    \n    [A] Muller et al., Instant neural graphics primitives with a multi-resolution hash encoding, ACM ToG 2022\n    \n    [B] Cao et al., Hexplane: A fast representation for dynamic scenes, CVPR 2023\n    \n    [C] Fridovich-Keil et al., K-planes: Explicit radiance fields in space, time, and appearance, CVPR 2023\n    \n    [D] Mildenhall et al., NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis, ECCV 2020\n    \n    [E] Chan et. al., Efficient geometry-aware 3d generative adversarial networks, CVPR 2022\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n2. **[W3] Scalability** \n    \n    Thank you for your comments on scalability. We have evaluated our method on larger datasets such as CIFAR10 and LSUN church, which contain 50K and 126K samples respectively, as detailed in Table 11 of the appendix. While we acknowledge the value of scaling to even larger datasets like Objaverse, our current resources limit this expansion. Nevertheless, we see this as a crucial next step and are exploring opportunities for such large-scale evaluations.\n\n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n3. **[W4] Significance of domain-agnostic architecture**\n    \n    Thank you for your insightful comment. Our domain-agnostic architecture, providing a consistent latent type for LDM, enables learning the unified priors across multiple domains, as you mentioned. We believe that our approach paves the way to a large-scale, multi-modal foundation model that encompasses 2D, 3D, or even other data types. Such a model could serve as a new tool for a wide range of cross-domain downstream tasks.\n    \n$$\\\\\\\\$$\n\n4. **[W5] Domain-agnostic architecture of DDMI**\n    \n    Our framework proposes a **domain-agnostic meta-architecture** for INR generation. Also, overall training and generation schemes are the same across multiple domains. This domain-agnostic meta-architecture allows us to use identical diffusion models in the latent space for generating 2D grid latent variables $\\textbf{z}$."
