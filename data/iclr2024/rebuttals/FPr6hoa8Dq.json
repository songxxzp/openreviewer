                    "value": "In this paper, the authors introduce an unsupervised deep learning method for simultaneous individual and joint deblurring and low-light image enhancement. The crux of their approach is rooted in an insight from NoiSER (Zhang et al., 2022a) that suggests the potential for low-light image enhancement through an instance-normalization layer, employing random noise images as both input and output for each pixel within training pairs. Consequently, this approach seamlessly integrates low-light image enhancement within the deblurring framework. The efficacy of this approach is assessed through experiments conducted under combined settings."

Consequently, the paper may exaggerate the breadth of its application scope.\n\n2. Given this broad scope, the paper lacks an in-depth analysis of the specific task it tackles. Notably absent are discussions on the predominant types of blur in low-light conditions, the scenarios where low-light enhancement and deblurring coincide, and the characteristic features of blurred low-light images. These omissions hinder the provision of insights into low-light deblurring scenarios.\n\n3. The novelty of the paper appears somewhat limited, primarily hinging on the utilization of NoiSER (Zhang et al., 2022a) and normalization layers. Furthermore, the GAN-based techniques employed for unsupervised deblurring are relatively commonplace."

The function of IN for LLIE is reasonable as it can eliminate domain differences and the target domain is normal-light and sharp images. The second and third reasons are a bit farfetched.\n3.

The generalization of enhancement performance is always a challenge for various LLIE methods; For deblurring, differences in the size and blurring kernels can also lead to differences in the distributions of degraded data. The generalization is also a challenge. The proposed method not only considers multiple degradation methods, but also considers the diversity of data in each degradation method. Has the generalization in this regard been considered and how the generalization is ensured?\n2. The method does not contain denoising-related operations and the blurred data in the training phase does not contain noise. Why does the method perform best in low-light image enhancement?"
