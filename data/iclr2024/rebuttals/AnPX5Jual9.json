I would like to provide a thoughtful response. If you still have any other questions, please do not hesitate to inform us. We will continue to do our best to provide answers for you.\n\n#### **The experiment is limited to AUC and LogLoss. How about other machine learning tasks? In recent machine learning tasks, AUPRC is often used instead of AUC.**\n\nIn the realm of feature interaction learning, particularly in the context of ranking tasks such as CTR prediction and product recommendation, the use of AUC and LogLoss has become a standard evaluation protocol across a large number of studies [1][2][3][4][5][6][7]. Specifically, AUC is widely accepted for its effectiveness in evaluating the ranking performance of models, especially in scenarios where ranking plays a crucial role. LogLoss, on the other hand, provides valuable insights into the probabilistic predictions of the model. For consistency and comparability within this field, we follow most of the previous works [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] that adopt these metrics as a benchmark for evaluating the model's performance.\n\nBy aligning with this established protocol, our aim is to ensure methodological rigor and facilitate meaningful comparisons with existing literature, especially with those closely related studies [1][2][3]. Therefore, following previous research efforts, we only tested the most commonly used machine learning tasks on the widely used datasets for feature interaction approaches. In the future, we will try to apply our approach to other scenarios or tasks. We hope that our work can make a broader contribution to the research community.\n\n#### **The improvement in experiments is marginal.**\nIn the research field of feature interaction learning, we often adopt AUC and LogLoss as metrics to evaluate model performance. Previous studies [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] have stated that a higher AUC or a lower LogLoss at the 0.001 level is regarded as significant. Specifically, a prior study [7] has pointed out that a slightly higher offline AUC is more significant in online traffic. In particular, our experimental results and metrics remain consistent with the majority of previous works [1][2][4][5], and the results indicate that the improvement achieved by our method is significant. \nWe utilized an open-source code repository and released our code, executed multiple runs for each result, and conducted significance tests, all of which can demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and ensure its reproducibility.\n\n[1] EulerNet: Adaptive Feature Interaction Learning via Euler\u2019s Formula for CTR Prediction, SIGIR 2023.\n\n[2] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020.\n\n[3] ARM-Net: Adaptive Relation Modeling Network for Structured Data, SIGMOD 2021.\n\n[4] DCN V2: Improved Deep & Cross Network and Practical Lessons for Web-scale Learning to Rank Systems, WWW 2021.\n\n[5] \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc40 $^2$: Field-matrixed Factorization Machines for Recommender Systems, WWW 2021.\n\n[6] AutoInt: Automatic Feature Interaction Learning via Self-Attentive Neural Networks, CIKM 2019.\n\n[7] Wide & Deep Learning for Recommender Systems, DLRS 2016."

How does it compare to other models?\n3) How is the theorem useful/helpful? Since it gives an asymptotic property of $\\Delta_{RFM}$ to $\\Delta_{R}$, but\n - There is no reason for $\\Delta_{R}$ to be better than $\\Delta_{RFM}$, why we approximate it?\n - If $\\Delta_{R}$ is indeed better, why not directly use $\\Delta_{R}$ to capture feature interaction?\n - Lemma A.1 holds when you assume the embeddings are random vectors. They however are not. \n\n4) Can the proposed method be interpreted as using dual embedding vectors for one feature, with the constraint that they have unit norm in one dimension? \n\n\n[1] Weiyu Cheng, Yanyan Shen, and Linpeng Huang.

I tend to keep my score because:\n\n1. the model still is too similar to EulerNet, despite it replaces the linear block with an attention block. The claims regarding arbitrarily large order and exponential explosion issue are not supported. It could be redundant to separately learn modulus and phase. If exponential explosion issue occurs, I couldn't see how such scheme could help. The modulus could still be too large;\n\n2. the Theorem does not support the model well. A simple MLP would do the same as a universal approximator, without all these loose/inappropriate bounds, under which I think related work could be as powerful as the proposed method."

The proposed method is similar to EulerNet with a stack of attention module.**\nIn Section 3.3, we highlight the novelty and differences between our approach and other feature interaction methods.\t\nOur proposed method and EulerNet [1] both model the feature interactions in the complex vector space, but there are still some noticeable differences:\n\n- First, EulerNet [1] uses simple **linear layers** to model arbitrary-order  feature interactions, with interaction orders determined by predefined linear combination coefficients.\nIn contrast, our approach develops a **self-attentive rotation mechanism** to model feature interactions, with interaction orders learned from attention scores derived from the context.\nThis enables our approach to effectively capture feature dependencies in varying contexts.\n\n- Second, EulerNet [1] simultaneously optimizes the modulus and phase of the complex feature interactions in a coupled way, leading to the the **exponential explosion** issue when dealing with a large order, due to the exponential growth in the modulus of complex features.\nIn contrast, we decouple the learning processes of the modulus and phase of complex features. Specifically, we use complex rotations to model complicated interactions and incorporate a modulus amplification network to enhance representations.\t\nThis approach effectively avoids the exponential explosion issue, allowing for the learning of **arbitrarily large order**.\n\n[1] EulerNet: Adaptive Feature Interaction Learning via Euler\u2019s Formula for CTR Prediction, SIGIR 2023.\n\n#### **2. There is no detail about dataset train/test split. Benchmarking is not rigorous and is hard to tell whether the proposed method is better or not in terms of performance.**\nTo maintain consistency with previous work, we follow the AFN [1] to process the ML-Tag and Frappe dataset, where the split ratio for the train/val/test is 7:2:1; we also follow the EulerNet [2] to process the Criteo, Avazu and ML-1M dataset, where the split ratio is 8:1:1. \nPrevious studies [1][2][3][4][5] have stated that a higher AUC or a lower LogLoss at the **0.001** level is regarded as significant.\nMore details can be found in their code repository.\nIn particular, our experimental results and metrics remain consistent with the majority of previous works [1][2][3][4][5], and the results indicate that the improvement achieved by our method is significant. \nWe utilized an open-source code repository and released our code, executed multiple runs for each result, and conducted significance tests, all of which can demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and ensure its reproducibility.\n\n[1] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020.\n\n[2] EulerNet: Adaptive Feature Interaction Learning via Euler\u2019s Formula for CTR Prediction, SIGIR 2023.\n\n[3] DCN V2: Improved Deep & Cross Network and Practical Lessons for Web-scale Learning to Rank Systems, WWW 2021.\n\n[4] \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc40 $^2$: Field-matrixed Factorization Machines for Recommender Systems, WWW 2021.\n\n[5] Towards Deeper, Lighter and Interpretable Cross Network for CTR Prediction, CIKM 2023."

(The detailed proofs are also provided in Section 3.1.)\n\n- Second, the orders learned in AFN [1] cannot capture the dependencies between different features, i.e., the interaction order of each feature is independently learned.\nHowever, as prior work [2] shows, in real-world applications, the importance  of a certain feature (controlled by the order) is often influenced by other features.\nIt is challenging for AFN [1] to effectively capture the varied feature importance in different interaction contexts.\nUnlike AFN, the interaction orders learned in our approach can effectively capture the dependencies between different features through the proposed self-attentive rotations, enabling it to learn the varied interaction orders from **the corresponding interaction contexts**.\n\n[1] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020.\n\n[2] Enhancing CTR Prediction with Context-Aware Feature\nRepresentation Learning, SIGIR 2022.\n\n#### **4.

Since it gives an asymptotic property of $\\Delta_{RFM}$ to $\\Delta_{R}$, but:**\n\n**(1) There is no reason for $\\Delta_{R}$ to be better than $\\Delta_{RFM}$, why we approximate it?**\n\n- We approximate $\\Delta_{R}$ to demonstrate that our method (**rotation-based** interaction) can be instantiated as any traditional **inner-product-based** feature interaction model (e.g. FM [1], EulerNet [2], AFN [3]), since the interaction learning function of arbitrary traditional models [1][2][3] can be expressed using $\\Delta_{R}$. Therefore, any traditional model can be viewed as a special case of our proposed method, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n**(2) If $\\Delta_{R}$\n is indeed better, why not directly use $\\Delta_{R}$\n to capture feature interaction?**\n - Previous studies [1][2][3] have demonstrated the effectiveness of using $\\Delta_{R}$ to model feature interactions. However, as mentioned earlier, **$\\Delta_{R}$ cannot effectively capture arbitrary high-order feature interactions** (due to the exponential explosion issue). \n In contrast, our approach ($\\Delta_{RFM}$) not only has approximate results to $\\Delta_{R}$ when the order is low, but also can scale to **arbitrarily high orders** of feature interactions, thereby illustrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed approach.\n\n **(3) Lemma A.1 holds when you assume the embeddings are random vectors. They however are not.**\n\n- As a recent study [4] shows, the feature embedding space can be regarded as an unobservable random variable sampled from a certain distribution. \nFollowing the study [4], on the strength of Mean-field Theory [5], we suppose different fields are mutually independent.\nThus, under the constraint of the L2 norm, for ease of theoretical analysis, we approximate it by sampling within a unit hypersphere.\nBecause for an unknown machine learning task, we cannot specify a particular and accurate distribution; it may be distributed in any region of the unit sphere.\n\n **(4) Can the proposed method be interpreted as using dual embedding vectors for one feature, with the constraint that they have unit norm in one dimension?**\n\n- Yes, this can be understood from a certain perspective. \nAs we represent a feature using a vector located on the unit circle in the complex plane, this complex vector can be expressed using two real vectors, i.e., $\\mathbf r + i \\mathbf p$, s.t., $\\mathbf r^2 +  \\mathbf p^2 = \\mathbf 1$.\nSpecifically, we use the arctangent function ($atan2$) of these dual embedding vectors to obtain the polar angle vectors in the complex plane, and model the feature interactions through the rotation transformations based on these polar vectors.\n\n[1] Factorization Machines, ICDM 2010.\n\n[2] EulerNet: Adaptive Feature Interaction Learning via Euler\u2019s Formula for CTR Prediction, SIGIR 2023.\n\n[3] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020.\n\n[4] Alleviating Cold-start Problem in CTR Prediction with A\nVariational Embedding Learning Framework, WWW 2022.\n\n[5] Variational inference: A review for statisticians, JASA 2017."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful suggestions and we have listed our response to your concerns as follows. If you also have any other questions, please feel free to let us know. We will continue to try our best to answer for you.\n\n#### **For weakness (1):**\nWe sincerely appreciate the terminology questions raised by the reviewer. In the field of click-through rate (CTR) predictions, the term **field-aware** was primarily introduced by the work of FFMs [1]. It mainly refers to multi-field feature embeddings and has subsequently spawned many other related concepts.\nFor example, in the context of neural architecture search [2], **field-aware** refers to searching the optimal embedding dimension at the **field-level**.\nIn this paper, we use the terms (**field-aware**, **instance-aware** and **relation-aware**) to denote the learning granularities of interaction orders, in consideration of maintaining consistency with the term **instance-aware** proposed in ARM-Net [3], a closely related work.\n\nSpecifically, we explained the concept of different learning granularities of interaction orders in Fig. 1.\nFor ease of illustration, we present the interactions with only two fields.\nSpecially, AFN [4] and EulerNet [5] simply assign a shared order for all features within each field, and thus, the interaction order is only aware of **field-level** information. \nTherefore, we refer to them as **field-aware** models.\nAs for ARM-Net [3] (**instance-aware**), the interaction order is learned based on the indicator of input features; i.e., each feature instance in a given interaction is assigned with a unique order, which is aware of instance-level information.\nAs for our approach (**relation-aware**), the feature interaction order is explicitly modeled through an attention mechanism; i.e., each feature combination (query-key pair) in a given interaction is assigned with a unique order (denoted as $\\alpha_{j,l}$), which is aware of the pairwise feature **relationships** in the context of any given feature $j$.\n\n\n\n#### **For weakness (2):**\nIn Section 3.1, we have discussed the main shortcomings of existing methods (e.g., AFN [4]) and the motivation behind our approach:\n\n- First, the order of feature interactions in AFN [4] cannot take arbitrarily large values, due to the exponential explosion issue, e.g., considering the interaction term $\\boldsymbol e_j^{\\alpha_j}$ with embedding $\\boldsymbol e_j = [0.5, 2]$, its order $\\alpha_j$ cannot be 100, since $2^{100}$ is exceptionally large, which makes them suffer from the gradient explosion issue.\nWe have also provided the detailed analysis in the Section 4.3 (**Arbitrary-Order Learning Analysis**).\nSuch approaches  cannot scale to high-order cases in industrial scenarios.\nAs our solution, we project features to the complex plane (polar angles) that converts the interactions into complex rotations.\nSuch transformation can effectively avoid the exponential explosion issue and allows for the learning of arbitrary large order. (The detailed proofs are also provided in Section 3.1.)\n\n- Second, the orders learned in field-aware and instance-aware methods cannot capture the dependencies between different features, i.e., the interaction order of each feature is independently learned.\nHowever, as prior work [6] shows, in real-world applications, the importance  of a certain feature (controlled by the order) is often influenced by other features.\nIt is challenging for both\nfield-aware and instance-aware models to effectively capture the varied feature importance in different interaction contexts.\nUnlike them, the interaction orders learned in our approach can effectively capture the dependencies between different features through the proposed self-attentive rotations.\t\n\n[1] Field-aware Factorization Machines for CTR Prediction, RecSys 2016.\n\n[2] AutoDim: Field-aware Embedding Dimension Search in Recommender Systems, WWW 2021.\n\n[3] ARM-Net: Adaptive Relation Modeling Network for Structured Data, SIGMOD 2021.\n\n[4] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020.\n\n[5] EulerNet: Adaptive Feature Interaction Learning via Euler\u2019s Formula for CTR Prediction, SIGIR 2023.\n\n[6] Enhancing CTR Prediction with Context-Aware Feature\nRepresentation Learning, SIGIR 2022."

                        "value": "#### **List of questions.**\n\n(a) Is equation 3 a learning function for 1 feature interaction? \n\n(b) How to model the relationship a_{1,m} between x_1 and x_m in this case? \n\n(c) How to indicate the number of feature interactions? \n\n(d) In my opinion, you might be referring to the Equ 7 in AFN [1], which is the output of the jth neuron. If yes, how to define the number of neurons (i.e., feature interactions)?\n\n- Answer (a): the equation (3) describes the interaction learning function with multiple interaction terms, and the set of order vectors is denoted as $\\mathcal{A}$. For example, considering the interaction $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_1 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2 + \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_3 + \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_3 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_3$ with three fields ($m=3$), the set of order vectors is $\\mathcal{A} = {[1,1,0], [0,1,1],[1,0,1]}$. (Specifically, $[1,1,0]$ for $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_1 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2$, $[0,1,1]$ for $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_3$, and $[1,0,1]$ for $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_1 \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_3$) Therefore, each order vector corresponds to an interaction term, and the number of feature interaction terms is the number of order vectors.\n\n- Answer (b): The feature interaction order $\\alpha_{1,m}$ is modeled by the attention score between the query $\\boldsymbol Q_1$ and the key $\\boldsymbol K_{m}$. In our approach, we use self-attentive rotations to model relation-aware feature interactions. Specifically, we have $m$ queries ($\\boldsymbol Q_1, \\boldsymbol Q_2, ..., \\boldsymbol Q_m$) and $m$ keys ($\\boldsymbol K_1, \\boldsymbol K_2, ..., \\boldsymbol K_m$), and each query (e.g., $\\boldsymbol Q_j$) will match all keys ($\\boldsymbol K_1, \\boldsymbol K_2, ..., \\boldsymbol K_m$), generating $m$ interaction orders ($\\alpha_{j,1}, \\alpha_{j,2}, ..., \\alpha_{j,m}$), constructing an interaction term $\\tilde e_1^{\\alpha_j,1} \\odot \\tilde e_2^{\\alpha_j,2} \\odot \\cdots \\odot\\tilde e_m^{\\alpha_j,m}$., measuring the relationships in the context of feature $j$. \nTherefore, the relationship $\\alpha_{1,m}$ is modeled by the first query $\\boldsymbol Q_1$ with the $m$-th Key $\\boldsymbol K_{m}$.\n\n- Answer (c): as mentioned in Answer (b), each query will construct a feature interaction term $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_1^{\\alpha_j,1} \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2^{\\alpha_j,2} \\odot \\cdots \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_m^{\\alpha_j,m}$.\nTherefore, the number of feature interactions is $m$ for a single head attention.\nAs introduced in Section 3.1.2 (**Multi-Head Rotation**), we use the head number $h$ to control the number of feature interaction terms (thus the total term number is $mh$).\nAll the output representations are concatenated as the input of the MLP, which enables it to filter out the useless interaction terms.\n\n- Answer (d): As introduced in Section 3.1.2, a feature interaction term (the Equ 7 in AFN [1], output of the j-th neuron) is also described in Eq. (7) in our paper ($\\mathcal{F}(\\mathcal{A}_j):=\\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_1^{\\alpha_j,1} \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_2^{\\alpha_j,2} \\odot \\cdots \\odot \\tilde{\\boldsymbol e}_m^{\\alpha_j,m}$), where the order is generated by the attetnion score from $j$-th query.\nTherefore, the number of feature interactions (neurons in AFN [1]) is the number of queries (i.e., $m$) for a single-head in our approach, and each query corresponds to a neuron.\nFor $h$ attention heads, the number of feature interactions is $mh$.\n\n[1] Adaptive Factorization Network: Learning Adaptive-Order Feature Interactions, AAAI 2020."

                    "value": "This paper proposes a new model, named RFM (Rotative Factorization Machine), that can capture higher order feature interactions. Instead of directly using feature embeddings, RFM applies exponential operator over the embedings, called angular representation of features. With that, the cross of features (say e^x*e^y*e^z) becomes the sum of transformed features (say, e^{x+y+z}). The authors employs transformer-like self-attention structures in RFM. RFM comes with a subnetwork which does modulus amplification for better capture of complex feature interactions. The authors conduct experiments over several datasets and showed RFM beats other state-of-the-art models."

If you also have any other questions, please feel free to let us know. We will continue to try our best to answer for you.\n\n **1. One key question is whether the proposed model is good at capturing high-order complex features, and how it achieves that.**\n\nAs discussed in Section 3.1, arbitrary-order feature interactions can be converted into the complex rotations in our approach.\n\n- In the theoretical aspect, we have proven in Section 3.3 that our rotation-based interactions can achieve the similar prediction effect to traditional inner-product high-order feature interactions, i.e., our proposed complex feature interactions can be degenerated to simpler ones after these transformations.\n\n\n- In terms of experiments, we have explored the model's ability to learn arbitrary higher-order feature interactions in Section 4.3 (**Arbitrary-Order Learning Analysis**).\nMeanwhile, the model performance presented in Table 3 further illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach (better than Complex MLP, i.e., EulerNet).\nFurther, in the ablation study (Section 4.3), after we remove the rotation component, the model performance shows a significant decrease, indicating that the proposed rotations are the keys for learning effective feature interactions. \n**To verify the degree of coincidence with the high-order feature interactions learned in RFM, we add the experiments using synthetic\ndata in Appendix I.**\n\n\n\n\n**2. Section 4 doesn't involve enough evidence that RFM is capturing feature interactions more efficiently, other than showing it has better prediction performance.**\n\n**We have discussed the inference efficiency of the model in Table 3 and analyzed the model complexity in Appendix E**.\nOur model's overall complexity aligns with that of the transformer. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the complexity information of the model, we present the training times for the experiments in the table below.\nPlease note that, due to the one-epoch phenomenon [1], we provide the training time (in seconds) for one epoch to facilitate a fair comparison.\n\n| Model | Criteo | Avazu | ML-1M | ML-Tag | Frappe |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|   LR  |   355.51  |   252.98  |   2.42  |   4.30  |   0.76  |\n|   FwFM  |   375.87  |   301.37  |   2.57  |   4.71  |   1.03  |\n|   FmFM  |   610.29  |  530.49  |   2.99  |   6.94  |   1.26  |\n|   NFM  |   565.35  |   464.63  |   5.07 |   10.30  |   2.76  |\n|   CIN  |   803.92  |   713.59  |   9.93  |   15.51  |   3.51  |\n|   CrossNet  |   452.21  |   403.73  |   3.39  |   11.47  |   1.37  |\n|   PNN  |   654.77  |   332.21  |  4.84  |   10.65  |   1.60  |\n|   Transformer  |  745.99   |   563.52  |   8.08  |   21.19  |   3.74  |\n|   DeepFM  |   445.21  |  384.64  |   4.50  |   10.49  |  1.63  |\n|  xDeepFM  |  857.64  |  724.78  |  10.94  |  17.77  |  3.84  |\n|  DCNV2  |  474.63  |  410.39  | 3.70  |  12.57  |  1.45  |\n|  AFN+  |  930.74  |  745.45  |  10.03  |  16.73  |  21.72 |\n|  ARM-Net+  |  1754.36  |  1140.30  |  14.89 |  30.69  |  27.94  |\n|  EulerNet  |  597.96  |  510.22  |  5.29  |  11.09  |  1.82  |\n|  RFM  |  783.43  |  681.27  |  6.11  |  17.59  |  1.92  |\n\n[1] Towards Understanding the Overfitting Phenomenon of Deep Click-Through Rate Prediction Models, CIKM 2022.\n\n **3.

The reason we use this form is primarily to explicitly emphasize that the feature embeddings we traditionally obtain correspond to the polar angles on the complex plane.\n Based on this concept, we can subsequently use a rotational mechanism to represent feature interactions.\n\n In other words, this is merely a conceptual shift rather than an actual transformation. \n In the computer memory or practice implementation, we are still using the variable $E(\\mathbf x_j)$ rather than $e^{iE(\\mathbf x_j)}$, and the subsequent attention mechanism is designed for a series of rotation transformations based on $E(\\mathbf x_j)$ (also $\\mathbf \\theta_j$).\n Based on this concept, after rotation, we use coordinate transformation (Eq. 12) to obtain the real and imaginary parts of the complex features, according to Euler's formula.\n\n In conclusion, it is merely an expression of an abstract concept rather than an actual transformation, hence there is no hidden cost."
