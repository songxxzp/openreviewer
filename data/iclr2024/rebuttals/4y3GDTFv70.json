                    "value": "1. It remains unclear how the proposed account substantially improves over Xie et al 2022, which already explained ICL in terms of the recovery of an underlying state / intention. The overall claim, and the explanation of in-context learning in Section 5, are similar to Xie et al. 2022.\nThe paper additionally provides sections about Chain-of-Thought prompting (Section 6) and instruction finetuning (Section 7), but they are quite informal and unspecific.\nThe arguments in Section 6 are informal, using the idea that direct transitions between query and answer intentions may be rare, and that intermediate steps are more well-represented. It is left open how these ideas would be formalized and what precise assumptions are needed. In particular, as Sections 2&3 only assumed single intentions for the generative model underlying language (one intention is sampled and mapped to a text), it is unclear how the ideas in Section 6 (which refer to chains of intentions) can be formalized within the overall framework.\nIn Section 7, the idea seems to be that instructions provide information about the intention \\theta, but this argument is again not formalized. Thus, it is left somewhat unclear how the formal results present a substantial advance over Xie et al 2022.\n\n2. Section 5 considers prompts consisting of demonstrations of input-output pairs, and assumes that these correspond to some underlying intention \\theta. The results in Section 5 show that, to the extent that underlying intentions are unambiguously recoverable, a predictor can correctly continue a prompt. However, this leaves open how an LLM would acquire the ability to infer the intention from such prompts, which typically have an unnatural repetitive structure, not well represented in the training set."

                    "value": "1. Issue with clarity: In Section 2, the definition of \\epsilon-ambiguity: What is \\theta_0? The condition seems to say that, whenever we sample \\theta_0 and then sample x \\sim q(x|\\theta_0), then Pr(\\theta_0|x) \\geq 1-\\epsilon(x) -- is this correct? Also, it seems Pr(.|.) is not defined. A plausible interpretation is that it is a Bayesian posterior for the prior q(\\theta) and the likelihood  q(x|\\theta_0) -- is this correct?\n\n2. Proof of Theorem 1: The last paragraph makes reference to neural networks and SGD, whereas the theorem statement makes no reference to these (it just refers to universal approximators, without reference to architectures or training procedures). Either the theorem needs to be rephrased, or the proof should be phrased for such general universal approximators."

What is important here is that LLM seem to solve a new task that is\nnot contained in the training data: that is called emergent. However, just \nfinding a latent \"intention\" (quite loosely defined in this paper) cannot\nexplain this behavior, because the new emergent intention just doesn't exist\nso far. Therefore, in spite of elementary mathematical discussions in Section\n4, the paragraph \"In other words, ...\" virtually adds nothing about the\nunderstanding of the behaviors of LLMs.\nConsidering other possible explanations, such as recently developed by Arora\net al.

                        "value": "**Replies to all reviewers:**\n\n- Xie et al. assume the languages are generated from an HMM process, which is quite limited and unrealistic. Our assumption on language generation (in Section 2) is dramatically different: languages can be generated from ANY stochastic process as long as they are informative, e.g. satisfying the condition (1) or (2).\n\n- Our theoretical results equally apply to both char based LLMs and BPE based ones. They both converge to the true distribution as long as a sufficient amount of training data and a large enough model are used. All the theoretical results presented in this paper are established through rigorous mathematical proofs, rendering them self-sufficient without reliance on empirical validation. The simulation results in Section 8 are included: i) to verify certain aspects of these findings; ii) to demonstrate the scaling behavior of LLMs (varying model capacity and the amount of training data) on a simple Markovian language.\n\n**To Reviewer 5EvL**:\n- $\\theta$ represents a random variable in the latent intention space, while $\\theta_0$ denotes the intention of $\\mathbf{x}$ in eq.(1) or (2). $\\Pr(.)$ stands for a probability value and $\\Pr(.|.)$ for a conditional probability.\n\n- The last paragraph in Proof of Theorem 1 is not really part of the theorem itself but just some remarks to explain Theorem 1 is practically achievable."
