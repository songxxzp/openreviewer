The contributions of this paper are:\n1. Introducing AnonymizedAI, the first DRL agent to win the IEEE microRTS competition.\n2. Demonstrating the importance of transfer learning to specific maps in achieving competitive performance.\n3.

We\nextended the Training on Larger Maps Discussion Section to include our current ideas.\n\n**What to action mask?:** We used MicroRTS-Py as the starting point and masked out a\ncouple more cases where the action would cause nothing to happen. Implementing action\nmasking is a major contribution of human knowledge to the learner but has been\nwell-established as critical for learning in microRTS."

RTS environments are difficult for RL agents because of their complex game structure with varying unit types and strategies, large action space, long episodes and sparse rewards.\n\nThe authors apply a number of implementation tricks to improve on existing methods, including using a value function that predicts three different rewards that vary throughout training and training 7 different networks and selecting based on the map. They then train an agent using behaviour cloning and then fine-tune it with deep RL."

The submission could be significantly improved by focussing more on understanding why and how the system itself works. For example, the paper could include ablations of the different design decisions, or attempt to train a deep RL agent on the largest map. Instead the paper is mostly a grab-bag of previously-known techniques that combine to produce a very good agent."

Unfortunately, we were time-constrained by the\ncompetition deadline and were experimenting with many different ideas going up to the\ndeadline. We ran training runs with changes and kept the changes that made \nimprovements or we believed would be useful down the line.\n\nOne example of this is the scaling the policy loss by the number of units that could\ntake an action, which was critical for our behavior cloning. We have now added our reasoning into the paper on\nwhy this is important; however, we believe this could be a candidate for an ablation\nstudy to determine if any learning rate works without this scaling.\n\nOther candidates for ablation studies include:\n- transfer learning smaller map agents to larger maps\n- varying reward weights, value loss coefficients, and entropy coefficients over time\n- cost-based rewards"

                        "value": "**SCC and related works discussion:** Thanks for pointing us to the SCC paper. It's\ndefinitely impressive to accomplish similar results to AlphaStar with a smaller model\nand order of magnitude less compute. We knew of TStarBot-X as another successful\nStarCraft II agent trained with orders of magnitude less computation scale. We didn't go\ninto these papers because these still required clusters of GPUs to train (SCC doesn't\ngive specifics but order of magnitude less is tens of TPUs still). We thought microRTS and the\nKaggle Lux competitions were more relevant given similar scale.\n\nAnswers to Questions:\n1. MicroRTS-Py had a bug where the second player would see resources (which should be\n  unowned) as owned by the first player. This was fixed for our agent. We moved that\n  mention up into the MicroRTS-Py section to make it more clear.\n1. Behavior cloning treats a reinforcement learning problem as a supervised learning\n   problem by making the ground truth the actions taken by the agent being cloned.\n2. AnonymizedAI trained 4 models fine-tuned to specific maps. 3 \"general\" models were\n   also trained for 3 different map size ranges (16x16 and smaller, up to 32x32, and up\n   to 64x64). Table 5 in the Competition Details Supplementary Section shows the 7\n   models' usage. The fine-tuned models significantly outperformed the general models on\n   their specific maps.\n3.  squnet is the name of our fewer parameter model. It is short for \"Squeeze U-Net\"\n    because it uses squeeze excitation like DoubleCone while being shaped like a U-Net. It is not\n    a U-Net.\n4. **Applicability to other strategy games:** We focused on\nmicroRTS because of its unique challenges and the existence of a benchmark without a\nstrong DRL agent. We have used the same techniques to train\nagents for the Lux Season 2 competitions, which is a similar turn-based game requiring\nthe coordination of many units individually. We have not tried other games, but we\nbelieve that many of these techniques would be applicable to other games. For example,\ncreating a curriculum of simpler scenarios and gradually increasing difficulty or using\na demonstration dataset to create a starting point for training are generally\napplicable."

AnonymizedAI exploits a combination of carefully fine-tuned base policies and map-specific transfer learning to outperform previous competition winners. The paper describes the implementation of AnonymizedAI, including its 7 trained neural networks and the significant effort required to train and debug the agent, emphasizing the role of iterative fine-tuning and transfer learning in the agent's success. Furthermore, the authors discuss potential improvements in inference time and explore behavior cloning and its potential to bootstrap models with novel behaviors."

The authors didn't delve into an analysis of diverse self-play strategies that could potentially improve the agent's performance. Considerations for strategies beyond basic self-play, such as fictitious self-play[1] or more complex schemes[2], would have enriched this study.\n\n- [1] Heinrich, Johannes, Marc Lanctot, and David Silver. \"Fictitious self-play in extensive-form games.\" International conference on machine learning.

It would be interesting to know whether the authors plan to explore the inclusion of more advanced self-play strategies, and how they believe these could potentially impact AnonymizedAI's performance.\n\n2. The authors have mentioned the possibility of using the imitation learning approach for bootstrapping models with novel behaviors. Could they provide more insights into potential novel behaviors they are considering and how these could improve the agent's performance?\n\n3. I did not find a description of the hardware information for training the agents in the paper, such as the CPU model and number of cores, GPU model and number of cores, the size of training memory usage, etc. I wonder if the author could provide this information."
