The breadth of analysis the author/s conducted include part-of-speech tag distribution, stop words use, semantic similarity from embedding representations, and theme selection from Roget\u2019s thesaurus. The authors then trained classification models using different models (SVM, Naive Bayes, XGB, BERT) using TF-IDF to which the results do not have extensive ablations with the preliminary features extracted. The author/s motivate the work and results by claiming that these types of studies on analyzing differences between styles of human and machine writing does not require complex models, however the depth of experimentations and contribution has not been met by the paper to produce a cohesive, impactful result."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The overall study seems to be just a mix-and-match of whatever tool is available for the author/s that will be able to give some form of analysis without proposing any novel approach to shed new insights in the growing field of discriminating between machine and human-generated texts. In addition, most of the analysis is weak or unmotivated. (For example, what are non-trivial features? Why is there a need for analysis of stopwords use? In what way does the use of stopwords shed light on human and machine-generated text?) Moreover, there is no comparison of existing works in literature including already established classification systems such as DetectGPT, GPT-Zero, etc with the trained models from the paper. These limitations in the paper severely affect the quality of the work and its inclusion for ICLR.\n\nAnother demerit of the paper is the lack of concrete discussion of the data used. The author/s claim that the data is novel but provides very limited information on how it was collected particularly on important details such as language, statistical characteristic (how long, how many words), context of where the comments or questions are about, genre or domain, etc. Moreover, the author/s seem to use the collected data for querying ChatGPT but other prompt-ready QA datasets have already been constructed. Why did the authors not use or combine this instead?\n\nImprovement of how the motivation of the paper is pieced together, especially in the Introduction section, should be strictly addressed to increase readability and in order for readers to appreciate the purpose of the study (see comments on structuring below).\n\nMinor comments on structuring and flow of discussion that need to be addressed:\n\nThe introduction section needs to be improved as it does not sound technical/scientific. Vague and overgeneralized claims with no basis should be removed particularly in the first sentence \u201cLarge Language Models (LLMs) have been propping up ever since OpenAI revealed ChatGPT\u201d. LLMs have already been an active research even before ChatGPT. The sentence \u201cChatGPT-generated content has made its way into all aspects of life.\u201d is also vague and too highfaluting. The introduction of ChatGPT had some impact, yes, but you need to ground this technical with figures instead and not with these types of statements.\n\nThere is no ChatGPT-4. Do you mean GPT-4? ChatGPT was packaged on its own using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model while GPT-4 is a separate model that was only integrated into the ChatGPT system as another option."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. What is non-trivial in the context of the study? And how does it differ from previous works (ex. https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07799, https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05185)  doing an evaluation of linguistic differences between humans and generative models (ChatGPT, GPT-2)? The term is only mentioned twice in the paper with no further discussion at all which makes any reader fail to appreciate the overall contribution of the study.\n\n2. The lack of context of the data retrieved from different platforms makes the experiment procedure suspicious and confusing. For example, from the data collected from Stack Overflow, are these singular-type questions or multi-hop questions? What were the subjects of the transcribed videos and answers from Youtube and Yahoo? These details are important.\n\n3. It was mentioned that the use of Roget\u2019s thesaurus is to map words to related categories for a thematic-style analysis. But why are other, more common forms of thematic analysis not explored such as LDA, BERTopic, or Contextual Topic Models? These might even give better results on the differences between theme use as evidenced by the results presented in their corresponding papers (especially CTM).\n\n4. What I understand from the classification phase is that the author/s uses TF-IDF as features for the models. Why not combine the other linguistic features used? There is no exploration or ablation from this particular experiment."

For example, although the author asserts the differences on the words based on Figure 6, using only two examples and a lesser-used metric \"WORD NEIGHBORHOODS\" is not sufficient to adequately demonstrate this point.\n\n3. The experiment is done on various metrics, unveiling whether human and ChatGPT texts are significantly different on the corresponding factors. However, the authors do not delve deeper to explain why these kinds of similarity or difference happen.\n\n4. In section 4.1, the author classify the documents with machine learning models. The usage of BERT is not explained clearly enough. Does BERT embeddings are simply used for classification without other machine learning models? If that, which kind of classifier is used?"
