To do this, the authors first propose a multimodal program planning task, where the model can generate plans consisting of a series of image-text pairs to provide more information for achieving the goal. Secondly, to accomplish this task, the authors propose a method that combines LLMs and textual-visual graph models with text-image prompts. Finally, they collect two datasets, WIKIPLAN and RECIPEPLAN, to evaluate the proposed method."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- The proposed method could improve the utilization of cross-modality. Cross-modal techniques such as soft prompting with embeddings or cross-modal attention mechanisms can make cross-modal matching more effective. Multimodal LLMs (Otter, MiniGPT, UniLM, GPT4, InstructBLIP, LLaVA, etc.) would also be more suitable for visual and language understanding.  \n- Although the paper provides a few baselines, the absence of baselines from existing text-based procedural planning works is a concern in assessing the usefulness of the proposed approach. Given that the paper makes use of Text Plan evaluation metrics, this part could be easily compared with recent procedural planning and script learning methods, e.g., [1,2]. \n- The proposed automated evaluation metrics access the generation quality. However, evaluation could be improved to assess 1) the degree of alignment or consistency between modalities, e.g., by using the Multimodal-Retrieval based metric proposed in [1], and 2) the quality of predictions or completions in these tasks, with evaluation tasks such as Next Step Prediction and Partial Sequence Completion from [2] or step reordering tasks.\n- Even considering the current baselines, automated evaluation results in Table 2 appear marginal compared to the Text-Davinci-003 + Stable-Diffusion baseline that uses \"LLMs and T2I models separately without collaboration\". It is worth noting that marginal benefits are observed for the Multimodality Plan evaluation.\n- Figure 4 examples do not appear very informative w.r.t. each of the subtasks. For example, part \"read up on ocean safety tips and know the rules of the beach\" is illustrated with a sign of text close to the beach reading \"ocean safety\" which does not relate to how safety signs would look in reality.\n- It seems a bit difficult to extract valuable insights from the comparison in Fig. 6. Apart from perhaps slightly better images in Steps 4 and 8, the rest seem equally good to me.  Please consider adding more details to the highlighted parts, e.g., \"Enjoy your freshly made juice!\" is highlighted for TIP but appears on the output of both methods. Appendix E.1 contains several examples but is not accompanied by a description of what is observed (any insights) from these examples.\n\nOverall the formulation of the proposed multimodal procedural planning task is of interest to the procedural planning and script learning communities, but the execution of the proposed method, baselines, and qualitative analysis require substantial revisions. \n\n[1] Multimedia Generative Script Learning for Task Planning\n[2] Non-Sequential Graph Script Induction via Multimedia Grounding"

For example, first row, WikiPLAN, is TIP chosen as better from human evaluators 63.34% of the time over the Image Ref + OFA-Caption baseline? \n- Can you also further explain the fact that, in terms of visual informativeness, the multimodal baselines can not achieve on-par results with textual reference-based baselines? Would it be that this is due to the lack of visual knowledge injected into LLMs, or perhaps a semantic gap between text and the generated images?\n- What percentage approximately of the Imagined Prompts are object-centric and how many also involve actions or individuals?\n- Can you share some statistics on the average step sequence/text length for the examples shown to human evaluators?"
