I have to confess that I cannot understand what is the key difference of the proposed\nmethod compared with existing differentiable ILP methods. \nThis is mainly because the paper does not provide many definitions and background knowledge needed to understand the paper.\n\nFor example, there is no explanation of the differentiable ILP task. Also, the task's input and output seem not explained.\nMoreover, there is no definition of first-order logic used in this paper.\nThe background section starts with explaining multi-hop reasoning as a problem on graphs. How are these graphs related to ILP?\nThe paper must clearly show how differentiable ILP relates to graph problems.\n\nWhat are the tree-like structures? I think the paper should give a formal definition of tree-like structures. \nWhat are the messages passed among graphs? Is a message a real-valued vector?\n\nIn summary, the paper might contain important ideas that might be useful for the ML community. However, the paper is almost \nimpossible to understand in its current form for many readers. Therefore, I suggest a major revision to improve its presentation.\n\n\n**Results of experimental evaluations are weak:**\nIn experiments, the paper compares the proposed method with a baseline. This section is weak because:\n- There are no explanations of the details of experimental settings.\n- The proposed method is compared with only one baseline method, and the reason why the paper compared with NLIL is unclear. I think the paper should compare with more baseline differentiable ILP methods.\n- Experimental results only report time and F1 scores. They seem insufficient to judge that the claim of the paper is correct."

We have improved our explanation of the problem formulation and learning task, as well as the definitions of many of the domain concepts. We have removed the discussion of multi-hop reasoning as it seemed to muddle the presentation of our method. We provide a more clear explanation of how our method formulates ILP as a graph link prediction problem. We have expanded the introduction of our experiments to provide more context on why they were selected and what characteristics of the algorithms they test. We have provided a clarified explanation of the motivation for selecting our baseline method.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your time and high-quality feedback."

The main contribution is an approach capable of learning a broader set of rules than what is currently possible with state-of-the-art neural ILP methods. The proposed method relies on evaluating/verifying SAT on tree-like FOL structures by adapting a factor-graph message passing approach similar to existing methods. The novel aspect is \u201cfolding\u201d which is to use this to learn more complex FOL structures by introducing constraints for merging similar structures. \n\nFurther, to learn using neural methods, each of the discrete operations in the evaluation and learning of FOL structures is encoded as a differentiable operation on a continuous tensor representation (similar to TensorLog). Experiments are performed on 3 datasets (one synthetic and 2 other standard ones) and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art neural ILP method show promising results."

We have also improved the narrative of our discussion to clarify that TensorLog is a database system that describes differentiable rule inference, and not another ILP technique. We have updated our explanations of the satisfiability derivation algorithm to improve the clarity of the SAT problem and our descriptions of it.\n\nThank you."

I can't give a concrete reference, but I am quite certain I have seen that before, maybe in a slightly different context. In any case, the step forward does not seem to be substantial.\n\nAlso, the practical relevance is not clear to me. Apparently, the authors had to define an artificial dataset where they can show that the technique does what it is supposed to do, because many standard problems can be solved with chains. \n\nReferences in the paper are weird, the authors almost always use \"author (year)\", also in cases where \"(author year)\" would be appropriate.  The first reference in the bibliography is not correctly sorted in (presumably there is something wrong in the BibTex entry).  In general, the related work is not very exhaustive, missing, e.g., recent works such as POPPER. For Metagol, no reference is given (only a pointer to a github page). It is also preferable to cite the published versions of arxiv papers, not the arxiv papers themselves.\nIt is interesting that the authors only provide URLs to papers by Yang et al. Why? Either provide all URLs or none. \n\nA few typos, such as \"boolean\" -> \"Boolean\". or a comma starting a new line (2nd paragraph 4.4). A careful proof-read would certainly improve the paper (but it is generally quite readable)."

Are these large graphs from which these relations are learned? How large? How would classical algorithms such as Foil or Aleph do on such problems? \n\nAre there benchmark problems where trees or more general graphs are necessary, or are chains sufficient for most problems?"
