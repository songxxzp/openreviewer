In (Montanari & Mezard, 2009), \nall edge weights are i.i.d. samples and there is no phase transition behavior. \nWhereas, (Semerjian et al, 2020) observe the phase transition behavior when switching the independent identical distribution (i.i.d.) assumption to independent non-identical distributions. Hence, we conjecture the phase transition is caused by the distribution discrepancy among different edges. \n\nAgain, thanks for your review of our work."

                    "value": "The clarity and pedagogy of the presentation of the paper seems rather insufficient to me. Section 2 is a review of the message-passing approach to the linear assignment problem, but the relation to the present problem is not motivated beforehand. Moreover the relation between the purely random and the planted version is not clear, and I don't think it is possible to understand the reasoning in Sec. 2.3 that leads to theorem 1, on which the rest of the results of the paper relies, without reading the original paper [Semerjian et al (2020)]. The Appendix A which seems to be aimed at clarifying this derivation remains quite obscure.\n\nOne of my main concerns is the use of theorem 1 in a setting where it does not apply: in [Semerjian et al (2020)] the weights on the edges of the graph are independent by construction, which allowed to write the recursive distributional equations (7). But here the weight matrix E=X B  has strong correlations in the edge weights, it is not clear why these should be neglected. The manuscript states on page 8 that in the \"non-oracle case\", \"Unlike the oracle case, we notice the edge weights Eij are strongly correlated\", but isn't it already the case that in the oracle case these are correlated ?\n\nThere are also imprecisions in the use of the \"phase transition\" phrasing, since there is not a clear description of the qualitative differences between the two phases that the transition should separate, and since a study of the effect of the system size on the sharpness of the transition is not presented in the main part of the text."

It is indeed quite surprising: from the beginning of the Section one understands that the \"statistically optimal\" estimator would involve solving a QAP, which is not doable efficiently, so how can one asserts that the LAP reaches statistical optimality if the latter is not known?\n\n- on page 14, in the description of the numerical procedure, I'm not sure that it is the dichotomy search that should be expanded upon, but rather what corresponds to the line 5 and 6 of algorithm 1. What is meant by \"run experiments\", the resolution of the LAP? With an exact algorithm or via message passing? Could you also specify the definition of the error rate, is it the fraction of samples on which the inferred permutation fails to coincide with the planted one, or the average fraction of the permutation that is correctly inferred? This last question applies as well to the y axis on the lower panels of figure 2."

To the best of our knowledge, the only related work is (Zhang, Slawski & Li, 2022) but they only prove the optimality holds for a restricted region. More specifically, they require the $\\textup{rank}(B) \\leq c\\log n/n$. \n\nSecond, the optimality of LAP over a wide range is answered by the cited work (Zhang & Li, 2020) (c.f. one line above  Equation (19)). Work (Zhang & Li, 2020) show that the mini-max lower bound of SNR requirement, i.e., no estimator can obtain the correct permutation matrix provided that $\\log SNR \\leq c_0 \\log n/\\textup{stable-rank}(B)$; and the LAP in Equation (19) can obtain the correct permutation matrix when $\\log SNR \\geq c_1 \\log n/\\textup{stable-rank}(B)$ ($\\textup{stable-rank}(B)=|B|_F^2/|B|^2$ is the stable rank). \n\nInterestingly, based on the current literature, the LAP estimator in Equation (19) can actually reach statistical optimality in a wider range than the QAP estimator."

In this sense, we can say $E$ is only weakly correlated. \nIn addition, the numerical evidence in Table 1 and Table 2 also suggests that we can safely ignore these weak correlations and predict\nthe phase transition points to a good extent. \n\n**2. Meaning of phase transition.**\n\nWe use the term phase transition to denote the phenomenon such that a small change in the parameter will lead to a sudden change in the reconstruction performance. That is, the error rate drops from one to zero drastically when SNR exceeds the threshold. The meaning of phase transition can be observed in Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 2, where we specifically study the change in error rates."

                        "value": "Your detailed comments are answered in the following. \n\n**1. Explanation of the reasoning in Section 2.3.**\n\nFirst, we explain the reasoning in Section 2.3 and the role of Theorem 1. Section 2.3 basically is to analyze the impact of SNR on the convergence behaviors of the message passing (c.f. Equation (6)). As it is very difficult to track all message flows, we view the message flows to be i.i.d. samples. Here, we regard the message flow $h_{i\\rightarrow (i, \\pi^{\\natural}(i))}$ and $h_{j\\rightarrow (i, \\pi^{\\natural}(i))}$ along the correct correspondence edge to be i.i.d. samples (represented by the random variable $H$). Similarly, we regard the message flows along the rest edges as i.i.d. samples from a distribution denoted by $\\hat{H}$. In this way, we only need to track two scalars ($H$ and $\\hat{H}$) instead of all message flows. The iterative equation is Equation (6), which can be further simplified to Equation (8) and can be analyzed by Theorem 1. When $\\inf_{\\theta} 1/\\theta \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E} e^{-\\theta \\Xi_i}\\right) > 0$, we have $H^{t}$ converge to a large positive value; whereas $\\inf_{\\theta} 1/\\theta \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E} e^{-\\theta \\Xi_i}\\right) < 0$ leads to a large negative value. Hence, we conclude there is a sudden behavior change, namely, phase transition happens when $\\inf_{\\theta} 1/\\theta \\log\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{E} e^{-\\theta \\Xi_i}\\right) = 0$. \n\n**2. Meaning of negative SNR.** \nThe negative SNR denotes the place of the potential phase transition points. As SNR is non-negative by nature, we can conclude there is no phase transition in this region, which means the permutation reconstruction cannot be ever reconstructed.  \n\n**3. Lower Approximation of Page 6. We use the standard inequality $\\log(1+x)\\leq x$.**\n\nIn the end, we would like to thank you again for your detailed comments. Please feel free to let us know if you have any other questions. We will be happy to answer them. Thank you.\n\n**4. Presentation of Algorithm 1 and detailed explanation of Lines 5 and 6**\n\nThanks for the suggestion in presenting Algorithm 1 that we may need to give more focus on Lines 5 and 6 rather than the \nbinary search. It is interesting that some other reviewers suggested that the binary search method \nneeds more clarification since many readers might be unfamiliar with it. We will try to balance these suggestions.\n\nRegarding Line 5, it corresponds to the estimators to solve the permutation matrix, that is equation (9) for the oracle case and equation (19) for the non-oracle estimator.\n\nAs for Line 6, the error rate refers to the fraction of samples on which the inferred permutation fails to coincide with the planted one, as we state in the second paragraph in Appendix C \"we calculate the error rate of the permutation matrix (full recovery)\".  Its mathematical definition is $L^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^L 1(\\Pi \\neq \\hat{\\Pi})$, where $1(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, $L$ is the number of experiments and is set as $100$. We explained this in the main text. Perhaps we can make it more explicit. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nAgain, thanks for your review of our work. Please kindly let us know if there are further questions. Thank you."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, thanks for your appreciation of our derivation of the phase transition SNR. It's very encouraging to see your positive comments such as our ideas are shining. \n\nWe feel your major concern is on whether our results can be reused or not.  \n\nFirst, we can assure you that **all theorems/propositions are rigorously derivated and can be confidently reused**. Regarding the approximations, they mainly exist in establishing the connections between the phase transition point and the SNR. To be more specific, it primarily involves two aspects (i) the process of linking the phase transition point and Equation (11) and (ii) approximating the solution of (11). The conclusions in Theorem 1, Proposition 1, and Theorem 2, are rock solid. \n\nNext, we address your detailed questions as follow. \n\n**1. Approximation of $\\log \\mathbb{E}e^{-\\theta \\Xi}$.**\n\n This is due to the relation $\\log(1+x)\\leq x$. \n\n**2. Justification of Gaussian approximation.**\n\nThe technique of Gaussian approximation is widely applied in analyzing the message-passing algorithm. One of the most successful its applications is in designing the LDPC code (c.f. 'Analysis of sum-product decoding of low-density parity-check codes using a Gaussian approximation' by Sae-Young Chung, T.J. Richard, and R.L. Urbanke). Its success is mostly verified by empirical experiments and the theoretical justifications are still awaiting to be given. \n\nAgain, we would like to mention that all theorems/propositions (Theorem 1, Proposition 1, and Theorem 2) are rigorously derived. The non-rigorous part is mostly about the dependence between the phase transition points and the expectation $\\mathbb{E} \\exp(-\\theta\\Xi)$ and its calculations. \n\n**3. Position of the Proof of Proposition 1.**\n\nIt can be found in Appendix B. \n\nAgain, thanks for your review of our work. Please kindly let us know if there are further questions.  Thank you."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, thanks for recognizing our work to be novel, of high quality, and with great significance. \n\nFirst, there seems to be a misunderstanding on Equation (3), please allow us to clarify. Our notations with (Montanari & Mezard, 2009) are in fact equivalent, so Equation (3) is correct. In both our work and (Montanari & Mezard, 2009), the terms with the indicator function are one when $\\sum_{j}\\Pi_{ij}  = 1$ (and $\\sum_i \\Pi_{ij} = 1$), and zero otherwise. They are both to enforce the constraint such that $\\Pi$ is a permutation matrix. \n\nNext, we answer your other questions. \n\n**1. Difference with Mezard & Montanari (2009).**\n\nWe consider a much harder problem than that in Mezard & Montanari (2009). In our work, the distributions of edge weights are neither identical nor independent. Moreover, we discover and analyze a phase transition phenomenon, which is the main contribution of our paper. Mezard & Montanari assume each edge weight is i.i.d. distributed and there is no phase transition phenomenon present. \n\n**2. Constraints on the simulations.**\n\nThere is hardly any constraint on the numerical experiments. In our experiments, we only assume the entries in the sensing matrix \n$X$ to be i.i.d. sub-gaussian with zero mean. For example, we consider Gaussian distributed $X$ in Table 1 and Figure 2, and uniformly \n$[-1, 1]$ distributed $X$ in Table 2. The sensing noise matrix $W$ is a Gaussian random matrix with each entry being a standard normal random variable. As for the signal matrix $B$, it can be an arbitrarily fixed matrix in the oracle case; and is required to have all eigenvalues reside within approximately the same region in the non-oracle case. \n\n**3. Practical applications of permuted linear regression.** \n\nFor the permuted linear regression, its application widely ranges from database merging, to privacy, to communications, to computer vision, to robotics, to sensor networks, etc. Two of the most important practical applications of the permuted linear regression include (i) linkage record, where we would like to align data from different sources and merge them into one comprehensive database; (ii) data de-anonymization, where we want to use public information to infer and uncover hidden identities or connections within private datasets. \n\nSince our work is a theoretical paper, our focus is on the theoretical analysis and prefer to leave the applications to the references, which are  (Unnikrishnan et al., 2015; Pananjady et al., 2018; Slawski & Ben-David, 2019; Pananjady et al., 2017; Slawski et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020). We can include more content on the practical applications of permuted linear regression if the readers feel helpful. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your valuable feedback. Please kindly let us know if there are further questions. Thank you."

To achieve this, the paper employs techniques derived from message passing algorithms. The central goal in the paper is to establish phase transition thresholds by assessing the signal-to-noise ratio ($\\text{snr}$) in two distinct scenarios. In the oracle case, the matrix $B$ is assumed to be known, while in the non-oracle case, $B$ is considered unknown. The derived thresholds serve as critical points where the error rates for permutation matrix recovery sharply drop to zero when the signal to noise ratio exceeds a certain threshold. Numerical results confirms the accuracy and reliability of the theoretically derived phase transition points in both the oracle and non-oracle cases."

Improved organization and perhaps some explanatory text would enhance the overall readability of the paper."

The sudden introduction of the linear assignment problem might be confusing to readers initially. Additionally, it would be helpful to include a note regarding the operational significance of the matrix $E$ and why it plays a crucial role in this context.\n\n- The derivation of the lower bound for $\\log \\mathbb{E}e^{-\\theta\\Xi}$ on page 6 is not clearly explained. Providing a more detailed and comprehensible explanation of how this lower bound is derived would greatly enhance the paper's clarity.\n\n- Given the significance of the Gaussian approximation in obtaining closed-form expressions for $\\text{snr}$, it would be valuable to provide an intuitive explanation of why this approximation is effective. \n\n-  The paper imposes a condition on the ratio of the singular values for matrix $B$ when computing $\\text{snr}_{\\text{non-oracle}}$. An explanation for the rationale behind this condition would be beneficial."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, thanks for your feedback and recognizing that our work is the first work that leverages the framework of message-passing algorithms to derive phase transition thresholds. In addition, we are pleased that you find our literature review comprehensive and informative. \n\nLet us address your questions. \n\n**1. Lower bound on Equation (6).**\nThe lower bound is obtained with the relation $\\log(1 + x) \\leq x$. \n\n**2. Intuition of Gaussian approximation.**\nThe choice of Gaussian approximation in the message passing (MP) is mainly due to its past success in analyzing the MP algorithm. One of the most successful examples is (c.f. 'Analysis of sum-product decoding of low-density parity-check codes using a Gaussian approximation' by Sae-Young Chung, T.J. Richard, and R.L. Urbanke), a famous paper in coding theory with more than 1600+ citations. \n\n**3. Role of the assumption such that all singular values of the matrix $B$ are of the same range in computing $snr_{\\textup{non-oracle}}$.**\n\nFirst, this assumption can greatly simplify the expression of $snr_{\\textup{non-oracle}}$. Otherwise,  $\\textup{snr}_{\\textup{non-oracle}}$ will be the solution of a quartic equation (fourth order) rather than a quadratic equation (second order). Second, this assumption can preserve the generality of our theorem since this assumption can cover a wide family of matrices, say sub-Gaussian random matrices. It is well known that all their eigenvalues are within the region $[1-c_0\\sqrt{m/p},~1 + c_0 \\sqrt{m/p}]$ (after column normalization), and satisfy our assumption that all eigenvalues are of the same range. \n\nIn addition, we appreciate your suggestions on the paper organization such as adding more discussion on the practical applications. As our work a theoretical paper focusing on bridging the message passing with the analysis of permuted linear regression, we limit the content to avoid distraction. The problem of permuted regression has many useful applications, for example:\n\n(A) **Record linkage**.  \nGiven multiple databases containing information about the same entities, the objective is to merge them into one comprehensive database. However, these data may not be well-aligned due to the data formatting or data quality issues. Modeling the mismatches as a permutation is investigated as a mitigation strategy. \n\n(B) **Data de-anonymization.** \nThis task can be regarded as the opposite side of privacy protection. The intruders aim to infer the hidden identities/labels in certain private networks with public information. One commonly used method is to compare the correlation between this information and to find matching pairs with maximum correlation sum. Here, the permuted linear regression arises as a natural generalization. \n\nFor more applications, we recommend (Unnikrishnan et al., 2015; Pananjady et al., 2018; Slawski & Ben-David, 2019; Pananjady et al., 2017; Slawski et al., 2020; Zhang & Li, 2020), which are a good starting point. We are happy to add more references on the applications if the reviewer suggests.\n\nThanks again for your review of our work. We will carefully revise our paper according to these suggestions. Please feel free to let us know if you have more questions. Thank you."
