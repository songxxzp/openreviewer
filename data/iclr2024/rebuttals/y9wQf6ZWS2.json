Although it's good to have a new algorithm in linear approximation Q-learning to converge to a unique solution asymptotically, the added regularization term increases the error bound between the estimated action value function and the optimal one. Based on the result in Lemma 3.2, it's not clear how the $\\eta$ parameter should be chosen. A relatively small $\\eta$ could potentially have very small denominator in the RHS, causing big error bound. Instead, if the $\\eta$ is chosen super big, the error tends to remain the same. The experiment in the Appendix also shows the larger $\\eta$ helps with the convergence rate. Does that mean we should always use a super big $\\eta$?**\n\nToo large $\\eta$ will cause high variance in the update because the algorithm is implemented in a stochastic sense. In general, the choice of $\\eta$ leads to a trade-off between the error and convergence property, and one needs to find a compromise between the two extremes, which may need further studies. In practice, we may choose decreasing $\\eta$, i.e., $\\eta_k = \\frac{\\eta_0}{k+1}$ with some positive constant $\\eta_0$ to mitigate the bias coming from the regularization coefficient.\n\n\n**2. The added regularization + asymptotic analysis seems not requiring that much effort given the previous works on Q-learning about O.D.E. analysis, switching system, and off-policy TD-learning.**\n\n\nCompared to the existing off-policy TD-learning analysis, the greedy policy of Q-learning, which is time-varying, makes the analysis much more intricate. \n\nCompared to the recently developed switching system-based analysis of Q-learning, adding regularization term to the system in our work requires more careful analysis. In particular, the main breakthrough in the current work is that we found a common quadratic Lyapunov function and used it for convergence analysis using a special structure of the switching system. This new finding is significant because it is in general hard to find a common quadratic Lyapunov function for switching systems. We expect that this new insight can be also used for Q-learning to accelerate its convergence speed, which can be potential future topics.\n\n**3. Based on the experiment in the Appendix, larger $\\eta$ seems to be helping increase convergence rate and reduce the estimation error. Does that mean we should always go with larger $\\eta$ value?**\n\n\nAs can be seen from the experiment in the Mountain car, large $\\eta$ does not necessarily imply better performance. \nIn general, the regularization coefficient $\\eta$ provides a trade-off between the convergence property and the bias error. \nIn particular, larger $\\eta$ leads to (faster) convergence while increased error. On the other hand, with small $\\eta$, the proposed regQ becomes more similar to the vanilla Q-learning, and hence, it can fail to converge, while the error may be reduced.  \n\nCompared to the Mountain car, the solution of $\\theta\\to 2\\theta$ and Baird environment are the origin. Hence, adding regularization term does not incur any bias and improves the convergence rate."

Seemingly, the novelty is an additional regularization term in the TD error to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the solution. It is unclear whether this new algorithm is better than vanilla Q-learning.**\n\nWe highlight several points that show that the proposed RegQ is better then vanilla Q-learning : \n\n First, as for vanilla Q-learning, when linear function approximation is used together, one cannot guarantee its convergence, whereas convergence of our algorithm can be guaranteed theoretically, which is given in Theorem 5.2.\n\n Secondly, as for vanilla Q-learning, there are cases where fixed points of the projected Bellman equation does not exist, and the corresponding example is given in Example A.9 in the Appendix. However, as for our modified projected Bellman equation, solutions always exist, and the corresponding example is given in Lemma 3.1\n\n Lastly, our experiments included in the paper demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows better or comparable results than vanilla Q-learning.\n\n\n**2. Although convergence of the regQ is provided, the paper does not show whether one can learn the optimal state-action value function well. Indeed, we do not know whether the Q-value associated with converges to the optimal of the MDP problem when goes to zero.**\n\nThe iterates of the proposed algorithm is proved to converge to the optimal Q-function with some biases which can be controlled by the regularization coefficient. Moreover, an error bound with the optimal solution is given in Lemma~3.2. We note that to remedy the bias, we can use a diminishing regularization coefficient, i.e., $\\eta=\\frac{\\eta_0}{1+k}$ at $k$-th iteration. \n\n\n**3. The experiment setting cannot reflect the practical need. More comprehensive comparison with benchmarks is necessary.**\n\n We will consider adding more comprehensive comparisons with benchmarks. However, we want to emphasize that validating on simple environments is also important as sanity check and for providing further insights.\n\n**4. It is not clear whether linear function approximation makes analysis much harder. What are the technical difficulties in the convergence analysis?**\n\nUnlike the tabular setting, the linear function approximation case does not guarantee convergence for Q-learning, which is the main difficulty. This challenge can be overcome through the switched system analysis and introduction of a regularization coefficient.\n\n**5. Do you have a sample complexity analysis of regQ? For Q-learning algorithms, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses are well-understood.**\n\nIn this work, we did not provide sample complexity result for regQ. However, we believe the sample complexity result can be also derived for regQ following the recent technique in the literature of non-asymptotic analysis."
