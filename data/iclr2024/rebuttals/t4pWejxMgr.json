                    "value": "However, there are a number of questions which need to be answered to make it a strong contribution. \n\n- on originality and significance: there have been plethora of papers [1,2,3] using genetic algorithms for optimising neural networks in one form or another. As things stand, it is not clear what is exactly methodological contribution in contrast with these approaches. In particular, [3] proposes the combination of genetic algorithm with gradient-based local search which seems to be related. One could think of the proposed algorithm 1 as a combination of existing methods, and it is important to show why this combination is not trivial.\n- on clarity: there are a number of questions both on the paper structure and reproducibility (see Q1, Q2, Q3)\n- on quality: the chosen motivation of medical prediction may sound unconvincing (see Q4) because the proposed medical problems would require consideration of causal relationships to make practical sense (see, for example, the difference with paper [4] which estimates (causal) treatment effects. \n\n[1] Stanley, Kenneth O., et al. \"Designing neural networks through neuroevolution.\" Nature Machine Intelligence 1.1 (2019): 24-35.\n\n[2] Montana, David J., and Lawrence Davis. \"Training feedforward neural networks using genetic algorithms.\" IJCAI. Vol. 89. 1989. \n\n[3] D\u2019Angelo, Gianni, and Francesco Palmieri. \"GGA: A modified genetic algorithm with gradient-based local search for solving constrained optimization problems.\" Information Sciences 547 (2021): 136-162.\n\n[4] Bica, Ioana, and Mihaela van der Schaar. \"Transfer learning on heterogeneous feature spaces for treatment effects estimation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 37184-37198."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "Q1 The paper's structure and presentation could be improved. For example, the first sentence of Section 6 is: \"In this paper, we try to overcome the low-data limitation problem in the medical domain by utilizing transfer learning and quality-diversity optimization. \" Isn't it something that we already know by this time? Then it can be safely removed.  Not so many works, despite the topics of the paper being largely popular, are covered in the Related works section.  The experimental conditions and hyper parameters are split between sections 4.2 and 5.1 making it difficult to understand. \n\nQ2 Reproducibility of the paper can be improved. For example, I couldn't find where and how the authors select popsize parameter and whether the same exact parameters have been used throughout all experiments. \n\nQ3 In Table 1, it is unclear whether there is a statistically significant improvement from using the proposed methods. It would be great if the authors could clarify upon this. \n\nQ4 The paper presents the findings on a number of problems which belong to the medical domain and usually considered as a problem of treatment effects estimation. In many standard machine learning questions (e.g., classification of ImageNet data), fitting classifier or regression model to get a functional dependency model is enough; however, I don't think this is enough for the proposed medical problems. In these problems, we need to distinguish between spurious correlations and causes and consequences between inputs (see Figure 1) and the predictions. Bica et al (2022), for example, make this important distinction and shows how the method could be used for predicting treatment effect."
