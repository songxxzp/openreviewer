Imprecise example of Privacy Protection.\nThe example in Figure 1 indicates that personal privacy issues are only present in the first sentence, and the key words \"man\" and \"admitted\" in that sentence have almost no impact on the subsequent content. Could it then be possible to simply delete the first sentence to achieve privacy protection, as extracting key words here does not seem to play a significant role.\n\n2). Privacy Protection as an Innovation Point\nRegarding the extraction of key words for privacy protection, the paper uses a medical NER model proposed by Neumann et al in 2019. We suggest further improvement of this model, for example, considering age as a crucial keyword for certain diseases and extracting it as necessary to better enrich the innovative aspects of the paper.\n\n3). Ambiguity of Symbols in Annotations\nAnnotation 13 on page 8 only appears in the content of the article but is not explained.\n\n4) The overall innovation of the methodology needs improvement, as the majority of the content relies on existing methods, such as the medical NER (Named Entity Recognition) model."

Concerns about the novelty.** \n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to further elucidate the innovative aspects of our work. Our paper introduces a novel approach that simplifies the integration of medical knowledge into SLMs by leveraging LLMs as a knowledge base. Unlike prior research that often relies on complex training algorithms and the intricate process of constructing medical knowledge graphs[1-3], our method streamlines this integration, which is substantiated by the performance improvements showcased in Table 1 in the paper.\n\nMoreover, our paper begins a crucial discussion on privacy issues when using LLMs in healthcare. This is a significant issue that hasn't been given enough focus in past studies [4-7]. By bringing this up, we aim to encourage more careful and ethical use of LLMs where patient privacy is a concern.\n\n**2. Concerns on using NER.**\n\nIn our paper, we utilize NER to extract keywords automatically, and we mention in the introduction that keywords can also be extracted by other methods, e.g., a manually created dictionary based on domain expertise. In practice, we can also use rules to post-process the extracted keywords or  keep clinicians in the loop to add or delete medical terms, thereby improving the quality of the medical keywords.\n\nWe adopt NER here because it is the most convenient way to extract relatively high-quality medical information from raw data. This supports our main idea that by utilizing LLMs as a database, we can generate medical knowledge for auxiliary SLMs in medical decision-making while reducing privacy concerns. We will further clarify the reason to utilize NER in our revision to improve clarity.\n\n**3. Suggestion about missed  footnote.**\n\nWe are grateful for your attention to detail. We will add this footnote in the revision. \n\n\n[1] Yasunaga et al. (2022a) Qa-gnn: Reasoning with language models and knowledge graphs for question answering \\\n[2] Zhang et al.

As this research utilized a named entity recognition model to extract keywords, it is possible that the NER model can extract privacy information such as patient names. Is there any filtering or postprocessing step to avoid that? In addition, it is not guaranteed that NER system will never extract sensitive patient information; for example, if the NER system incorrectly extracts a patient's address as a symptom, then the address may be leaked to LLM. Although it is very rare, it is still necessary to comment on this. \n2. As the LLM already provides a preliminary decision, I am curious about the performance if we only feed the preliminary decision from LLM to SLM. It is worth knowing which part of the LLM-generated information improves the SLM most. \n3. The related work section need to discuss more LLM application in the clinical area, especially the knowledge-enhanced LLM in clinical settings. For example, paper \"Qualifying Chinese Medical Licensing Examination with Knowledge Enhanced Generative Pre-training Model.\" also utilized external knowledge for clinical questions. \n4.

Their positive observations about the novelty and thoroughness of our experiments are very encouraging. We have addressed your concerns in our response.\n\n**1. Concerns on privacy preserving in practical usage.**\nThe data we utilized in experiments have already undergone post-processing; however, even well-processed data cannot be directly shared with third parties in a real-hospital setting. Here, we adopt NER methods directly, solely for automation, to show that LLM can be utilized as a medical database to query knowledge under privacy-restricted scenarios. Practically, we can leverage de-identification models and rules to remove personal information and then extract medical keywords to query third-party LLMs for auxiliary knowledge generation. In this paper, we take an initial step to discuss the significant privacy-preserving situations in the medical domain and demonstrate the promising results of utilizing LLM to improve SLM while mitigating privacy concerns.\n\n**2.Question about what SLM learns for decision making.**\n\nWe feed preliminary decisions (PD) as context into SLM with backbone BioLinkBert-Base on three datasets. Three separate runs for each setting are conducted and the average results along with the standard deviation are reported. The results are shown in the Table below.\n\n\n|            | MEDQA         | HeadQA        | MEDMCQA       |\n|------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| SLM w PD   | 47.21 \u00b1 0.31  | 53.64 \u00b1 1.09  | 45.42 \u00b1 0.17  |\n| FTC        | 50.17 \u00b1 0.42  | 61.35 \u00b1 0.16  | 49.20 \u00b1 0.45  |\n\nFTC, which integrates extensive medical knowledge into the decision-making, shows a consistent and significant improvement over the SLM that only uses PD for context. These findings underscore the valuable contribution of leveraging comprehensive medical knowledge, provided by LLM, in enhancing the medical decision-making capabilities.\n\n**3. Suggestion about related work in LLM application in the clinical domain.**\n\nThanks for the suggestion in the related work. We will add the suggested work into the related work section in the revision.\n\n**4. Question abut address long medical context generated by LLM.**\n\nWe utilize the Fusion-in-Decoder [1] approach in our general domain experiments. This strategy is also effective for encoding long contexts. It works by dividing the input into smaller passages, encoding each one separately, and then combining the encoded representations for decision-making.\n\n[1] Izacard et al.

From Figure 1, it seems that privacy definition is restricted to private identifiable information (PII). The authors should clarify the scope of privacy risks. Importantly, the proposed method cannot address general private information leakage that is considered by strict formulations like differential privacy.\n2. (Quality) The evaluation of privacy is not strict. \n  - Risks: It is possible that the keyword extraction includes private identifiable information (PII), for instance, names and dates as shown in Figure 1. There is no theoretical guarantee for privacy protection or empirical evaluation of the leakage rates of such PII.\n  - Metric: The authors used the privacy budget for quantifying privacy risks:  the ratio of the number of words provided to the LLM to the total words in the original question. However, I doubt if the metric can imply some privacy risks. There essentially lacks an intuitive explanation of the relationship between the privacy budget and privacy risks.\n3. (Motivation) As the authors said, SLM presents a large gap compared to LLMs and thus there is no clear motivation to use SLM for prediction. Although the authors mention that ChatGPT requires access to data, it is essentially ignored that open-source LLMs, for example, Llama, can be used. In the paper, there is no referred evidence for the large gap between open-source LLMs and ChatGPT on the concerned medical tasks. Thus, I strongly doubt if the motivation of the paper can hold."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for their comments and feedback. We reply their concerns in the below.\n\n**1. Concern  on privacy definition.**\nPrivacy is a multifaceted concept with varying definitions that depend on the context and use cases. Our definition of privacy differs from that of differential privacy, which offers a theoretical guarantee but may not always be practically applicable. In our setting, privacy issues do not arise during the training process but instead when calling third-party APIs with tokens to query medical knowledge. Specifically, we define the privacy budget as the ratio of the number of words from the original question that are provided to the third party for prompting the language model, as detailed in Section 5. Intuitively, the less information provided to the third party, the better the privacy condition we achieve; if no words are sent, there is no privacy risk. \n\nFurthermore, Figure 1 is for demonstration purposes only and is not used to define privacy in terms of personally identifiable information (PII). In practice, we can employ additional de-identification methods to remove PII from medical terms in the preprocessing or postprocessing stages. In this paper, our primary contribution is to demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLM as a database for generating medical knowledge to enhance SLMs' performance. We also initiate the discussion of LLM utilization under privacy-restricted conditions, which previous works [1-4] have overlooked. We will revise our paper to include a clear definition of privacy in our context, thereby improving its clarity.\n\n\n**2.  Concerns about motivation to utilize ChatGPT instead of open-source LLMs.**\n\nWe evaluate medical domain specific LLMs based on LLaMA [5] : AlpaCare [6], PMC_LLAMA [7], ChatDoctor [8], Medalpaca [9] and Baize-healthcare [10]  on the three QA datasets following [11]. The results are shown in the table below.\n\n|               | MEDQA  | HeadQA | MEDMCQA |\n| ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------- |\n| FTC           | 53.85  | 63.17  | 52.09   |\n| ChatGPT-privacy | 41.7  | 47.5   | 35.2    |\n| AlpaCare      | 35.0   | 29.2   | 33.5    |\n| PMC_LLAMA     | 34.2   | 28.1   | 28.6    |\n| ChatDoctor    | 34.3   | 30.0   | 33.5    |\n| MedaIpaca     | 38.4   | 30.3   | 31.3    |\n| Baize-healthcare | 34.5 | 29.3   | 32.5    |\n\n\nChatGPT significantly outperforms domain-specific LLMs across three QA datasets under privacy-restricted settings, demonstrating that the medical knowledge within open-source LLMs still lags behind the GPT-series models. Additionally, our FTC, which further leverages the knowledge provided by ChatGPT, achieves better performance, indicating the effectiveness of our methods.\n\n\n[1] Ho et al., (2022)  Large language models are reasoning teachers \\\n[2] Shridhar et al., (2022) Distilling multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models into smaller models via semantic decompositions \\\n[3] Wang et al., (2022) Pinto: Faithful language reasoning using prompt-generated rationales \\\n[4] Li et al., (2022)  Explanations from large language models make small reasoners better \\\n[5] Touvron et al.

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and feedback. Their positive remarks regarding motivation, comprehensive experiments, and our efforts in addressing privacy concerns are truly encouraging. Please see our response to your concerns.\n\n**1. Concerns about contribution in the clinical domain.**\n\nThe reviewer asserts that there seems to be room for improvement in our algorithm, but it is not clear to us from which perspective we should improve. In addition, we wish to highlight that the contributions of a paper can be evaluated from various perspectives, not limited to algorithms alone.\n\nThe primary contribution of our paper is the proposal of a simple yet effective method to utilize LLM as a medical knowledge database, which enhances the decision-making abilities of downstream SLMs. Unlike previous works in medical QA that utilize more complex algorithms and extensive engineering to integrate medical knowledge graphs or databases [1-3], our approach simplifies this by foregoing the complex engineering involved in building knowledge graphs and training algorithms such as GNNs. It has been empirically validated to outperform these methods, as demonstrated in Table 1 in the paper.\n\nFurthermore, our work pioneers the discussion on privacy concerns within the utilization of LLMs in the medical field, a critical issue that has been overlooked in previous research. This innovation opens up new pathways for the deployment of LLMs in sensitive domains.\n\nWe also note that the reviewer has acknowledged our contributions to the medical domain with comprehensive experiments and our efforts to mitigate privacy concerns in the review of the strengths section. In this case, we kindly request the reviewer reevaluates our paper based on the clear contribution.\n\n**2. Concerns about experiments in medical examination QA datasets.**\n\nIn this paper, our primary focus is on multiple-choice medical QA instead of question generation to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach for several reasons. Firstly, these datasets encompass a wide range of medical topics, including anesthesia, radiology, and pharmacology [4], and different medical applications such as diagnoses and examinations [5]. We can comprehensively evaluate the performance of our methods across various crucial medical domains. Secondly, evaluating question generation tasks presents significant challenges due to limited datasets and the high cost of performing real-world evaluations with clinicians. Hence, we chose medical QA datasets to strike a balance between evaluating medical ability and feasibility, following previous works [1-3,6-9]. We will add the reason for choosing medical examinations in our revision for further clarification.\n\n**3. Concerns about medical knowledge generation methods and denoise capacity of SML.**\n\nAlthough LLM cannot always generate perfect medical knowledge and may produce noise, alternative external knowledge auxiliary methods are also imperfect.  For example, retrieving information from knowledge graphs and bases not only requires a separate retriever, but also yields noisy and incomplete results since these sources are human-constructed. Consequently, retrieval processes might acquire irrelevant knowledge, potentially hurting model performance.\n\nAdditionally, We show that  SLM possesses robust denoising capabilities in Section 5.  Even when received with partially correct noisy medical knowledge, our SLM can  make a correct decision by extracting useful information.  Furthermore, other potential methods, such as integrating LLM with the internet,  could improve the generation quality of LLM for more reliable medical knowledge.\n\n\n[1] Yasunaga et al.
