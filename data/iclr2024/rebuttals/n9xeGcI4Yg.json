EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING is a game-theoretic approach, where a generator aims to communicate a correctness parameter to a discriminator through natural language sentences. By formulating language model decoding as an imperfect information sequential signaling game, the authors develop computational procedures to find approximate equilibria of the game. The experiment uses a set of QA tasks to evaluate EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING, including MMLU, ARC, RACE, HHH, and TruthfulQA, and a math benchmark GSM8K. Across these tasks, EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING consistently improves performance compared to existing LM decoding procedures."

The authors develop robust computational techniques for finding approximate equilibria in the consensus game, ensuring reliable and practical implementation of the EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING algorithm. The paper also demonstrates the quality of the research through its extensive evaluation across a diverse range of tasks, showcasing consistent performance improvements over existing decoding procedures.\n\n3. The authors provide a concise and coherent description of the EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING algorithm, making it accessible to readers.

To improve clarity, we will include a pseudo-code with a running example in our revision.\n\n**Typos**\n\nThank you for catching those typos. We will fix them in our revision.\n\n**How is the payoff matrix defined for the consensus game?**\n\nSignalling games are sequential in nature, as such, they are typically represented in tree-form as we show in Figure 1 (i.e., D and G both receive a reward of 1 each if D picks the correctness parameter that D was trying to communicate. In all other cases, they receive a reward of 0 each). More specifically, D and G receive a reward of (1, 1) each if and only if G picks the same correctness parameter (correct or incorrect) that D received. In all other cases, they receive (0, 0). So, for example, if D receives the signal \"correct\" and produces a natural language string \"u\". And if G, conditioned on \"u\", produces \"correct\", they both receive (1, 1). If G instead picks \"incorrect\", they both receive (0,0).\n\nWe hope we have addressed your questions and concerns. Do let us know if you have any other questions!"

To find the equilibrium, this work adopts the piKL algorithm proposed by Jacob et al., 2022. The overall method is a training-free method and can consistently outperform several baselines on a variety of QA tasks (also including open-ended and math reasoning tasks)."

                    "value": "1. If we compare the proposed ER-based reranking method and previous baselines, there are actually two major differences. One is the process of finding the Nash equilibrium under the regularization part, the other is the combination of two normalized probabilities in Section 2.2. In the current evaluation, it is clear that the combination of these two can bring consistent improvement, but it's unclear what is the effect of each individual component. It would be helpful to have a baseline just combining the two normalized probabilities (e.g., via the MI approach).\n2. This paper can benefit from showing some intrinsic analysis of the inconsistency of the generator and the discriminator. Right now, while the evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is unclear how severe the problem is, and in how many cases finding the equilibrium can help.\n3. I understand the piKL algorithm is from Jacobs et al., 2022, but I would still suggest the authors provide a slightly more detailed description in the appendix. The lack of related details makes it very hard to understand how important the hyper-parameters are, and if the method is sensitive to these values."

Should there be an additional $1/t$ before the $Q$? This will also make it more similar to the algorithm in Jacob et al., 2022. Otherwise, can you explain why there is a difference?\n2. Since this is a training-free method, I'm wondering if the authors have tried on even larger models.\n3. This can entirely be future work for a separate paper, but I just wonder if the authors have tried to fine-tune the models (e.g., the smaller 7B one) using the same objective.\n\nTypo: on page 7, Race-high -> RACE-high"

To tease apart these two components of EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING, we have run a new ablation experiment that reranks using a pointwise-mutual-information-style product using $\\pi_G^{(1)}$ and $\\pi_D^{(1)}$ rather than unnormalized generator and discriminator probabilities. This new ablation (labled MI* in the table below) does improves performance over  baseline approaches but consistently underperforms the full EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING method. We will include these results in the revised version of the paper that we will upload in the next few days.\n\n\n| Domain        | Model | ER-G     | ER-D     | MI\\*     |\n| ------------- | ----- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| MMLU          | 7B    | 39.4     | **39.9** | 35.8     |\n|               | 13B   | 44.9     | **45.1** | 43.1     |\n| ARC-Easy      | 7B    | **71.6** | 71.5     | 71.04    |\n|               | 13B   | 76.1     | **76.4** | 76.1     |\n| ARC-Challenge | 7B    | **58.7** | 58.3     | 58.5     |\n|               | 13B   | 61.1     | **61.4** | **61.4** |\n| RACE-Middle   | 7B    | 63.2     | **63.5** | 62.8     |\n|               | 13B   | 67.9     | **68.6** | 67.5     |\n| RACE-High     | 7B    | 56.3     | **56.4** | 55.9     |\n|               | 13B   | 62.1     | **62.8** | 62.2     |\n| HHH           | 7B    | 71.5     | **71.5** | 69.7     |\n|               | 13B   | 61.1     | 61.1     | 61.1     |\n\n**Intrinsic Analysis of Inconsistency**\n\nThank you for the suggestion! In order to look at how severe the problem is, we performed an analysis looking at how often the argmax answers from G and D disagree in each task. The table below shows that they do in fact disagree with each other a significant amount. Furthermore, we also observe that in cases where the disagreement % is larger, EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING offers the most benefit relative to G (The pearson correlation between \"Disagreement %\" and \"% Improvement\" is 0.64). We will include these results in the revised version of the paper that we will upload in the next few days.\n\n\n| Task           | Model | Disagreement % (G & D)   | G    | ER-D | % Improvement   |\n|----------------|-------|--------------------------|------|------|-----------------|\n| MMLU           | 7B    | 69                       | 30.4 | 39.9 | 31.3            |\n|                | 13B   | 60.6                     | 41.7 | 45.1 | 8.1             |\n| ARC-Easy       | 7B    | 56.1                     | 68.2 | 71.5 | 4.8             |\n|                | 13B   | 46.1                     | 71.2 | 76.4 | 7.3             |\n| ARC-Challenge  | 7B    | 65.9                     | 47.3 | 58.3 | 23.2            |\n|                | 13B   | 59.1                     | 51.9 | 61.4 | 18.3            |\n| RACE-Middle    | 7B    | 55.8                     | 57.7 | 63.5 | 10.0            |\n|                | 13B   | 53.2                     | 60.1 | 68.6 | 14.1            |\n| RACE-High      | 7B    | 62                       | 46.4 | 56.4 | 21.5            |\n|                | 13B   | 58.8                     | 47.9 | 62.8 | 31.1            |\n| HHH            | 7B    | 46.1                     | 59.3 | 71.5 | 20.5            |\n|                | 13B   | 38                       | 60.2 | 61.1 | 1.5             |\n\n\n**More detailed discussion of piKL in the appendix?**\n\nThank you for your suggestion, we will do that!\nMore context behind the choice and properties of piKL can be found in our response to Reviewer Jsc5."

                        "value": "**Question 1 (Equations (1) and (2))**\n\nThe difference between the way our algorithm is written, and the way piKL-Hedge (Algorithm 1 of Jacob et al.) is written, is just cosmetic and amounts to a change of variable. The policies the two algorithms produce are equivalent. \n\nIn the original piKL paper, Algorithm 1 (piKL-Hedge) keeps track of cumulative values in the variable named $\\textsf{CV}^{(t)}$ on line 11. Then, the update is \n\n$$ \\pi^{(t+1)}(a) \\propto \\exp \\{ \\frac{\\eta \\textsf{CV}^{(t)}(a) + t \\lambda \\eta \\log \\tau(a)} {1 + t\\lambda\\eta} \\}$$\n\n(where for us the anchor policy $\\tau$ is $\\pi^{(1)}$, the initial policy of the language model.) In our paper, we use the same formula above, but divide the numerator and denominator of the fraction inside the exponentiation by the same quantity $\\eta t$. This results in an update of the form\n$$ \\pi^{(t+1)}(a) \\propto \\exp \\{ \\frac {(\\frac{1}{t}\\textsf{CV}^{(t)}(a)) + \\lambda \\log \\tau(a) } {1/(\\eta t) + \\lambda } \\}$$\n\nIn fact, in our paper we keep track of the average values, which we call $Q$ (indeed, observe in the display equation at the very bottom of page 4, the cumulated values $\\sum\\frac{1}{2}\\pi(\\cdots)$ are divided by $t$ on the left of the sum). So, in summary, our updates are equivalent to those of piKL and can be written as\n$$ \\pi^{(t+1)}(a) \\propto \\exp \\{ \\frac {Q^{(t)}(a) + \\lambda \\log \\tau(a) } {1/(\\eta t) + \\lambda } \\}$$\nwhich is what we have in the paper.\n\nThe reason why we performed this change is that the numerical range of the $Q$ variables we keep track of remains small, whereas the cumulated utilities $\\textsf{CV}$ can grow linearly in absolute value.\n\n**Question 2 (What about larger models?)**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately, due to the size of the datasets and the number of tasks involved, we have not been able to evaluate our approach on models larger than LLaMA-13B. We leave this to future work!\n\n**Question 3 (Could ER be used for fine-tuning?)**\n\nWe think the idea of fine-tuning the models using this objective is a great idea, but this is not something we have been able to try yet.\n\n**Typo**\n\nThanks for the catch. We will fix this in our revision."

I believe this paper will be substantially clearer and stronger with these additional results in the final version. That said, the improvement is slightly underwhelming (<1% in 8/12 experiments) compared to the new baseline. In such cases, it would be great if the authors can provide some insight on when and how the ER-D/ER-G methods can bring substantial improvement. For that reason, I feel this paper is more suitable for a score of 7 instead of 8, However, 7 is not an option available, so I keep my score unchanged."

                        "value": "Thanks for your review!\n\n**Methodological notes behind the choice of Equations (1) and (2)**\n\nWe use Equations (1) and (2) to iteratively refine the policies of the players (generator and discriminator). Such policy-refinement procedures typically go under the name of \"learning dynamics\" in the theory of learning in games. Methogologically, the learning dynamics we use in our paper were designed to achieve the following desiderata:\n1. The update rules in Equation (1) and (2) are very easy to implement in practice, in that they only require elementary operations such as exponentiation and normalization. This enables us to efficiently implement the refinement operations in a framework such as NumPy or PyTorch in only a couple of lines of code.\n2. The update rules guarantee strong _no-regret_ properties. Regret is the standard optimality metric for online learning, and intuitively tracks the discrepancy between realized utility and the best utility that could have been realized in hindsight. \n3. The update rules ensure that the refined policies do not get arbitrarily far from the initial policies that are produced by the language model. As explained in the paper, this is important to guarantee _reasonableness_.\n4. By virtue of their no-regret properties, the update rules retain strong connections with game-theoretic notions of optimality. \n\nFrom a technical point of view, Equations (1) and (2) are a form of mirror descent, a generalization of gradient descent that accomodates more specialized geometries, such as the natural geometry of conditional probability distributions, such as in the case of this paper.\n\n**On the reliance on piKL**\n\nWe disagree that reliance on piKL limits the methodological novelty of the paper, for two reasons:\n1. The use of game-theoretic learning dynamics for language generation is novel. For historical context, prior uses of piKL were in the direction of providing interpolations between imitation learning (aka. behavioral cloning) and pure self-play learning in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, we realized that the strong mathematical properties of piKL dynamics could be used to help guide production of language, which led to this paper. (See also above for considerations that help explain the speicifc choice of using piKL dynamics.)\n2. From a technical point of view, piKL dynamics were defined in the context of normal-form games (that is, simultaneous-action nonsequential games, such as rock-paper-scissors). Instead, we instantiate piKL as part of a sequential potential (coordination) game.\n\n**Why search for coarse correlated equilibria?**\n\nThe existing analysis of piKL-hedge provides a guarantee of convergence to a coarse correlated equilibrium. However, as we hinted at the very end of Section 2.2, we  believe that in the case at hand most no-regret dynamics (including our own) will actually converge to Nash equilibrium. This is because the consensus game is a *potential game*, and in potential games dynamics based on smooth regularization are known to lead to Nash equilibria. Unfortunately, piKL is not, strictly speaking, an instance of such a dynamics, due to the fact that entropic regularization does not guarantee Lipschitz-continuous gradients. (Very small perturbations of piKL dynamics could fix the issue, but introducing a negligible amount of $\\epsilon$-exploration). In practice, we observe excellent convergence properties, and leave the question of ironing out these technical subtleties for future work.\n\nWe will add this discussion in the next version of the paper that we will upload in the next few days.\n\n**Drop in performance on the HHH dataset**\n\nWe first note that on this benchmark, other hyperparameter settings of EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING for LLaMA-13B results in the performance that is close to LLaMA-7B. The drop in performance for the larger model could be explained by the fact that HHH dataset tests the alignment of instruction-tuned chatbots. The LLaMA models that we use are not instruction-tuned which makes them poor at following prompts of the form listed in Appendix B. Furthermore, inverse-scaling (where, performance of larger models degrade) has been observed in similar tasks such as TruthfulQA [1].\n\n[1] Lin, Stephanie, Jacob Hilton, and Owain Evans. \"TruthfulQA: Measuring How Models Mimic Human Falsehoods.\" Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). 2022."

                    "value": "Originality: There have a lot of recent investigations into improved decoding strategies; this paper's approach is quite original in taking a game-theoretic formulation to (essentially) the problem of factuality from language models. This actually makes a lot of sense; human language as pointed out in one of the references is a strategic game between agents and thus we should be modeling it as such and not a pure optimization problem. This particular insight is not new, but this idea stands out to me because of its practicality. It should be noted that the idea could be said to be inspired by recent work on diplomacy and the core algorithm is an adaptation of the same. However, it takes a good deal of originality to make the connection to discriminator/generator as a game and present the particular formulation in the paper.\n\nQuality: The approach has the strong benefit of simplicity in implementation, it requires no re-training of the LM itself. It does seem to require some degree of non-trivial post-processing in the form of running the iteration procedure of eq 1/2. The authors dont address this but I would expect that it would not affect overall latency of LM inference by much and also it scales zero with LM size (iiuc). The experimental evaluation is quite exhaustive and satisfactory, there are a range of datset types explored. the equilibrium methods don't dominate on every single dataset but they generally do quite close to the SoTA and in some instances far exceed. \n\nClarity: The motivational sections, the presentation of the key insight and the experimental section are mostly quite clear and the paper was a pleasure to read. I appreciate the use of shading to visualize the relative improvement between the best and other methods in Table 1/2/3.\n\nSignificance: I think this could be an very impactful paper. The results are generally very good, it is easy to implement and does not require extensive tuning it seems to get to work, and it seems from my understanding to be scalable to very large LM sizes."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Clarity: The paper is actually written fairly well, but there could be some improvements: \n a. sec 2.2 was far too short. readers without any Game theory background might not even know what regret means. You dont need to fully flesh out all the derivation and algorithm, but a better intuition I think should be built, which might require 2-3 paragaphs more. I think this can be taken from the experimental section, where although there is a lot of useful material, at a pinch some of it can be moved to appendix to make room. Further a couple of (minor) sources of confusion on my first read:\n\n a.  'reasonableness' is a bit of a misleading word for the concept you are trying to capture. Maybe 'alignment' ? bu that has other implications in the LM space.\n b. eq 1/2: i think it's helpful to clarify that this update does not result in a backprop to the params of the LM. The reason is that in the current RLHF literature that is generally what happens so it is easy to get confused.\n \nc. Bit confusing to put ER-G and ER-D in the section on \"Baselines\".\n\n\nQuality: I am not at all sure about the characterization of SC as significantly related to Contrastive Decoding. The idea of using a weaker LM as the contrastive seems quite significant to me as it enables the strong LM to \"avoid\" the weaker ones mistakes, which for reasoning problems often are systematic reasoning errors. So it is unfortunate that CD was not compared against (Though I guess the paper with strong results for CD on reasoning problems was quite recent?) \n\nSignificance:  The biggest challenge to the potential significance of this work is that it doesnt seem readily applicable for all use cases of LMs. You need a sort of fact-checking problem, where a set of candidate answers are present. This means it can't be used out of the box as a general decoder, which would be sort of a holy grail right now. Nevertheless, I think the set of applications it is relevant for is hugely important and it is likely to find application given its ease of use."

Regarding the remark in the last para of sec 2.2, what is the difference between the convergence result of Anagostides (2022) and the one claimed earlier in the prev para?\n\n2. I am wondering about a subtle form of bias that may creep in with use of this method. We \"train\" the model with both correct and incorrect answers at the root node, which is good. but then over time we are likely to model select on some dev set using only accuracy as our metric [since generally that's what we care about], which means we only care about the 'correct' branches. Is this a possible problem?\n\n3. Both ER-G and ER-D are quite competitive and there is no clear winner between the 2. Is there some simple combination strategy you recommend? ensemble or averaging?"

                        "value": "Thank you for your review!\n\n**Clarity**\n\n1. Thank you for your suggestion, we will improve section 2.2 to include a more detailed introduction in our revision.\na. \"Reasonableness\": We acknowledge this concern and are open to suggestions! As you pointed out, \"alignment\" does have usage in this space that could make it confusing.\nb. We agree and will note this point in our revision.\nc. You are right. This subsection should be called \"decoding methods\".\n\n**What is the relationship between our CD experiments and [1]?**\n\nWe agree our CD baseline is sufficiently different from other work that we should clarify in our revision. We were unable to compare against CD for reasoning [1] as it was concurrent with our work. We do note that we *can* provide a direct comparison to published CD numbers on ARC-E and ARC-C. On ARC-E, LLaMA-13B + ER-D (76.4) is competitive with the (**much larger**) LLaMA-65B + CD ($\\beta=1.0$) (76.9). On ARC-C, LLaMA-13B + ER-D (61.4) outperforms LLaMA-65B + CD ($\\beta=1.0$) (59.7).\n\n**How does this generalize to other language modeling problems?**\n\nOur approach does require using LMs as \"sequence-level\" discriminators that evaluate complete generations. That said, we are still able to apply it to standard generation tasks by formulating them as generate-and-rerank problems (like we do in GSM8K and TruthfulQA) - that is, we first sample a set of candidates from the language model using top-p and top-k sampling then use EQUILIBRIUM-RANKING on top. It can thus already be applied to open-ended generation problems. We think that recent work in partial reward models [2, 3] is a promising direction for future work that could apply it directly to generation rather than discriminative reranking.\n\n**Convergence result of Anagostides et al.**\n\nA celebrated result in the theory of learning in games is that the average play of no-regret dynamics converges to the set of coarse correlated equilibria of the game. However, since our game has additional structure (in particular, it is a potential game), most learning dynamics in fact converge to Nash equilibria, which are always a subset of coarse correlated equilibria. Anagnostides et al. provide a general framework for analyzing this phenomenon for a general class of dynamics based on the online mirror descent framework. Unfortunately, while piKL is in the spirit of the algorithms studied by Anagnostides at al., we remark that due to technical conditions (specifically, a lack of Lipschitz continuity of the gradient of the entropy regularizer close to the boundary of the policy space), piKL is not, strictly speaking, an instance of the dynamics studied by Anagnostides et al. In practice, this subtlety seems to be simply a technical detail, and we indeed observe excellent convergence properties. We leave the question of ironing out these technicalities for future work.\n\n**Bias in approach**\n\nIn the gameplay itself, the \"correctness parameter\" is always uniformly sampled from between \"correct\" and \"incorrect\". However, we haven't experimented with fitting this prior on a dev set, which as you pointed out could result in bias of the form you described.\n\n**Combining ER-G and ER-D**\n\nWe do not have strong intuition here but we think that additive or multiplicative ensembling are both great options for combining these two approaches!\n\n[1] O'Brien, Sean, and Mike Lewis. \"Contrastive decoding improves reasoning in large language models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.09117 (2023).\n\n[2] Wu, Zeqiu, et al. \"Fine-Grained Human Feedback Gives Better Rewards for Language Model Training.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.01693 (2023).\n\n[3] Yang, Kevin, and Dan Klein. \"FUDGE: Controlled Text Generation With Future Discriminators.\" Proceedings of the 2021 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies. 2021."
