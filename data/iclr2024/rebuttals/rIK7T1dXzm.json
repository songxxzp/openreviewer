The authors propose this approach based on the usage of counterfactual intervention. CMM leverages two distinct causal graphs for different input data types, enabling effective learning of multimodal reasoning. The authors also present the ROTX-MPed dataset, enriching existing data with some counterexamples of ROTX."

It is less diverse as used for training and testing. \n\nHow are the training of the yolo and faster rcnn used in Table 2? Are they trained with only RGB images or RGBT images? \n\nThe CMM framework is based on the Uncertainty-guided model with FPN and ResNet50 as backbone. How about the proposed framework on other architectures like vision transformer or MLP-based models?"

Why not create a dataset that includes ROTO, RXTO, and ROTX data types together and train the model using all three types of data to achieve genuine all-weather, all-day detection?\n2. Figure 1 seems counterfactual. The purpose of introducing multimodal data is to complement the deficiencies of single-modal data (usually RGB). In Figure 1(b), the RGB data already performs well in object detection. I personally tested several sets of ROTX data from the paper using YOLOx, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, and found no cases of missed detections.\n3. How would the results be if the ROTX input type is tested only with RGB data and the RXTO input type is tested only with T data? How does your method improve fusion performance when the input type is ROTX or RXTO? What evidence supports this?\n4. To my knowledge, there have been many works studying uni-modal sensory bias in multimodal learning, such as \"Balanced Multimodal Learning via On-the-fly Gradient Modulation\" (CVPR 2022). Therefore, your contribution is not accurately summarized.\n5. Some results in Table 2 are unusual. The AP of YOLO-v5 using only RGB data on the ROTX-MPed dataset is higher than the AP of CMM using RGB+T data on the same dataset. What is the significance of introducing RGBT data?\n6. Why not validate the generalization of the proposed method on other tasks based on RGBT data, such as RGBT tracking and RGBT saliency object detection?\n7. The writing is not concise and not easily understandable."

The experiment results have some vague interpretations. For instance, there are no instructions explaining why Table 2 only displays MR results on KAIST and CVC-14, but not FLIR.\n2. Considerations and experiments regarding the time complexity/overhead might be a worthy add to the proposed method.\n3. The claims of the proposed dataset require more explanations or experiments to support them. According to the main results, the uni-modal sensory bias problem is solved, especially under nighttime conditions, and the RGBT fusion detection should perform better than uni-modal detection. The results trained on KAIST are satisfactory, and those trained on CVC-14 are also competitive. However, the results trained on FLIR are contrary.\n4. Under equation (11), \u201cL\u201d - typo?"
