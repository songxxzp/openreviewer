                        "value": "Thank you for the positive feedback on our paper. We're glad that our experiments were well-received and found to be of value.\n\n# Inter-instance and inter-class relationship \n\nHere, we explain how our method differs from other contemporary approaches and its unique effectiveness.\n\n## Inter-class relationship\n\nTraditional logit-based knowledge distillation (KD) methods [1,2,3,4], primarily adopt an instance-based approach. DKD leverages this approach effectively by incorporating additional losses alongside the standard cross-entropy loss. This method is adept at capturing inter-class relationships for individual instances, thus effectively utilizing 'dark knowledge' to enhance performance. While instance-based knowledge typically focuses on the output of the last layer (e.g., soft targets), it often overlooks the vital intermediate-level supervision provided by the teacher model. This supervision is crucial for representation learning, especially in very deep neural networks.\n\n## Inter-instance relationship\n\nInter-instance relation-based knowledge delves into the relationships between different layers or data samples. To find a better relation between two layers,  Yim et al. (2017)[5] introduced FSP, which uses the Gram matrix between two layers to summarize the relations between pairs of feature maps, calculated using inner products between features from these layers. Most of the methods extract knowledge from **hint (feature-based) layers** [6], which is the output of a teacher's hidden layer. For this, these methods become feature-based and expose privacy concerns for adversarial attacks, computational requirements, etc. We notice that most of the methods do not consider the inter-class and instance-based relations together. In this paper, we aim to integrate both inter-class and inter-instance relationships but without the help of feature layers so that our method becomes logit-based KD.\n\n## LumiNet vs. Jin et al. \"Multi-Level Logit Distillation\"\n\nOur method and Jin et al. share similar motivations, i.e., considering both inter-class and inter-instance relationships from output predictions (logit layers). To extract knowledge, Jin et al. introduced batch-, class- and instance-level alignment. For batch- and class-level alignments, they utilized the well-known Gram matrix and correlation methods, and importantly, they introduced **three additional loss functions**. Like Jin et al., our method emphasizes output prediction to understand subtle knowledge. However, our method simplifies the process by not requiring additional loss functions to understand inter-class relationships. We have introduced a new concept called the \"perception\" matrix (Eq. 3), distinct in its mathematical approach from previous methods, aimed at capturing inter-instance relationships. This matrix is tailored to enhance and adjust the logits on an instance level.\n\nFor improved representation in Jin et al., prediction augmentation is utilized, which involves augmenting the instance-level representation by dividing it with a temperature value. However, our approach does not require such a strategy. Notably, this algorithm heavily depends on the auto (strong) augmentation technique, which is discussed in detail in response to reviewer 3qnl.\n\nThe fundamental differences in approach and philosophy to knowledge distillation between LumiNet and Multi-Level Logit distillation are significant. While LumiNet focuses on recalibrating instance-level logits using a perception matrix of inter-class instances, Multi-Level Logits emphasizes direct alignment and linear augmentation across multiple levels by introducing additional losses and complexities.\n\n# Including baseline TAKD and DML\n\nThanks for pointing this out. TAKD and DML results are already in Tables 1 and 4. In the revision, we have included those results in Tables 2 and 3. Now, all baselines are considered in the experimental section.\n\n**References**\n1. Hinton, Geoffrey, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean. \"Distilling the knowledge in a neural network.\" arXiv 2015.\n2.

Checking \u0394 (DKD - ReviewKD) one can see DKD outperforms ReviewKD in a **single** case (ResNet50 \u2192 MobileNet-V2). In contrast, observing \u0394 (Ours - ReviewKD) we see that our method beats ReviewKD in **two** scenarios (ResNet50 \u2192 MobileNet-V2 and VGG13 \u2192 MobileNet-V2). On the other hand, when ReviewKD outperforms both DKD and our method, DKD gets performance gaps **1.00, 0.44, and 0.71**. In contrast, corresponding gaps are minimized in our case with **0.79, 0.19, and 0.13**. All this data shows that our method bridges the gap between logit- and feature-based methods more successfully than the previously known best logit-based distillation, DKD. In other words, While DKD tends to lag behind feature-based methods in various architectures, our approach has successfully reduced this performance disparity. From this, we can conclude our method achieves better generalization than DKD.\n\n\n# Incorporating Feature-Based Loss\n\n##Table E. Performance of our method with incorporating to ReviewKD Loss\n| Teacher/Student Architecture | ReviewKD | Ours   | Ours*  |\n|------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| WRN-40-2 \u2192 ShuffleNet-V1     | 77.14    | 76.95  | 77.29  |\n| ResNet32\u00d74 \u2192 ShuffleNet-V2   | 77.78    | 77.55  | 77.93  |\n\nHere, we combine feature-based loss from ReviewKD in our method. As expected, this integration improved the performance of knowledge distillation, as shown in the table. We know that feature-based methods may impose privacy concerns for adversarial attacks, computational requirements, and so on. Therefore, we aim to advocate for logit-based knowledge distillation to make the process resource-efficient and versatile for various applications. However, this experiment shows that **one can improve the performance of our method by combining feature-based losses** and also considering those negative aspects of feature-based distillation. These results are added in the supplementary material.\n\nWith the addition of other constraints in feature-based distillation methods, here, we point out loss function-specific details that may contribute to longer converge time.\n\n- **ReviewKD**: Employs a comprehensive knowledge distillation approach but demands significant training time due to its intricate multi-level distillation process and the integration of complex components like the Attention-Based Fusion module. In addition, the iterative review and fusion processes inherent in the technique extend the training duration.\n\n- **OFD**: Focuses on distilling information across multiple intermediate layers, yet it necessitates additional convolutions for feature alignment, leading to increased computational demands.\n\n- **CRD**: Introduces a contrastive loss to transfer pairwise relationships effectively, but this method requires maintaining a large memory bank for features (e.g., all 128-d features of ImageNet images), significantly elevating the computational costs.\n\n# Comparing with more state-of-the-art results\n\nIn light of your feedback, we have added Liu et al. \"Function-consistent feature distillation\" for comparison with our method in Table 1."

What is \"the essence of the teacher\u2019s knowledge\" here? In the paper, I can only find some intuitive analysis and overall performance to support the proposed method.

My concerns about the improvements over DKD have been properly addressed. However, I am still confused about the concept of \"perception\" introduced in the method. I think the new method is basically close to DKD and \"Multi-Level Logit Distillation\" mentioned by other reviewers. I am also not convinced by the explanation of the \"unique\" part of motivation and the advantages of the proposed method. It seems the authors want to create a new concept while failing to clearly illustrate why the new concept is necessary and there is also no empirical evidence to directly support the new concept. \n\nAfter reading the authors' feedback as well as other reviews, I think there are still unresolved issues about the novelty, presentation, and experimental analysis.

It's noteworthy that while DKD does show improvement over KD, LumiNet further enhances these results. Additionally, when comparing DKD with ReviewKD, which often ranks second-best, DKD's advantage is marginal in some architectures and even less in others. This is particularly noteworthy, considering several logit-based KD methods tend to underperform relative to KD. \n\n## DKD vs. Luminet\n\nIn the traditional KD method, we generate a set of predictions (called a logit vector) for each training sample from both the teacher and student models. The goal is to make the students' predictions closely match the teacher's. This is done using KL divergence loss generally, which measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. The methodology of DKD emerged from the traditional KD. The main objective of DKD is to match the student's logits as closely as possible with the teachers (shown in Fig. 4 of the DKD paper). The logit vector is divided into two parts: target (the term \"TCKD\" as mentioned in the DKD paper) and non-target (the term \"NCKD\" as mentioned in the DKD paper). The target part relates to the specific category we're interested in, while the non-target part contains other categories. DKD treats these two parts differently, using separate objective functions for each. The non-target categories hold 'dark knowledge'\u2014subtle information crucial for the student model to capture inter-class relationships. By separating the logits, DKD aims to extract more detailed and valuable knowledge, potentially leading to better performance of the student model. In the final loss (Eq. 6 of DKD paper),  DKD sums up these two object functions and cross-entropy loss.\n\nOur approach differs fundamentally from DKD and other logit-based methods in a crucial aspect: **Instead of mimicking the raw logits from the teacher model, we've developed an innovative method named 'perception' to reconstruct the logits.** This reconstructed form is distinct from the raw logits. The reconstructed logits represent a different form, distinct from their original configuration. This reconstruction depends on the context of other instances in the same batch, differing significantly from traditional methods. Second, we emphasize the importance of intra-class relationships in recalibrating logits, a consideration absent in DKD and any instance-based KD algorithm. Lastly, unlike DKD's dual objective functions for separated logit vectors, we employ a single objective function combined with cross-entropy loss, challenging the need for logit decoupling that DKD claimed."

                        "value": "# Effectiveness of our method on ViT and larger model as a teacher\n\nWe assume that referring to stronger/larger teacher models means larger teacher models than the student model, as there is no universally defined strong teacher model. In this case, we have tested our method with significantly larger teacher models (table 1) compared to the student model. For instance, we have demonstrated results using combinations like (ResNet110, ResNet32) (vgg13, MobileNet V2) and (ResNet32x4, ShuffleNetV2), where the teacher models are considerably larger than the student models. In these scenarios, our method continued to perform at a state-of-the-art level, underscoring its effectiveness even with substantial differences in model size.\n\nPrevious methods usually do not report results on vision transformer-based teacher models. However, we have conducted preliminary experiments in this area to address the reviewer's comment. We compared our results with traditional Knowledge distillation in Table B of the reviewer response 3qnL, which indicates that our method still maintains a similar level of performance advantage as observed in traditional KD setups.\n\n# Specific analyses Ours vs. existing methods\n\nIn traditional knowledge distillation (KD), the primary aim is to comprehend the inter-class relationships of a specific instance. However, in the context of Differentiable Knowledge Distillation (DKD), although the objectives align closely with KD (as evidenced by the prediction similarity in Fig. 4 of the DKD paper), challenges arise in heterogeneous settings and complex tasks like object detection. That's why we mention 'sometimes fails to wholly capture the essence of teacher's knowledge'.  Instance-based knowledge traditionally concentrates on the outputs from the final layer, such as soft targets, but tends to neglect the crucial guidance offered by the teacher model at intermediate stages. This intermediate-level supervision is particularly important for learning representations in very deep neural networks [2].\n\nTo address this, techniques based on features or relations have been employed [2, 3]. However, these approaches often require substantial resources and encounter various issues, as elaborated in response to Reviewer 8pKb. Our method introduces an innovative solution to this problem. We have developed a new function, which we term 'perception', derived from Eq. 3. This function enables the capture of relational knowledge from a batch without additional objective functions or resources.\n\nThe key distinction between DKD and our method lies in the reconstruction of logits. In our approach, logits are restructured to carry information about other instances inherently. This novel advancement in instance-based distillation allows for more efficient and effective knowledge transfer without the need for extra computational resources or unnecessary complexity. In short, by employing Eq. 3, we have successfully integrated relational knowledge into the instance-based method, filling a previously existing gap.\n\n# Minor issues\n\nWe have addressed other minor issues in the revised manuscript.\n\n**References**\n1.

                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback. We're glad you found LumiNet's modification to logit Knowledge Distillation simple and effective. \n\n# Comparing with Jin et al. \"Multi-Level Logit distillation\"\n\nWe appreciate your observations. As suggested, we have performed new experiments to compare with Jin et al. work. Please note that Jin et al. considered the Auto-Augmentation technique [1] to benchmark results. In contrast, the benchmarking in our paper did not consider Auto-Augmentation (similar to DKD [2]). Since Jin et al. did not report results without Auto-Augmentation, we exclude comparing our work with them. To ensure a fair comparison, we present updated benchmarking results where Auto-Augmentation has been applied to the CIFAR-100 dataset.\n\n## Table A. Comparison between Jin et al. and our method after applying Auto Augmentation on CIFAR-100.\n\n| Teacher                  | WRN_40_2  | WRN_40_2  | VGG 13    | ResNet32\u00d74 | WRN-40-2  |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|\n| **Accuracy**                | 75.61     | 75.61     | 74.64     | 79.42      | 75.61     |\n| **Student**              | WRN_16_2  | WRN_40_1  | VGG 8     | ShuffleNet-V2 | ShuffleNet-V1 |\n| **Accuracy**                | 73.26     | 71.98     | 70.36     | 71.82      | 70.50     |\n| **Multi-Level**          | 76.63     | 75.35     | 75.18     | 78.44      | 77.44     |\n| **Ours\\***               | **76.91** | **76.01** | **75.57** | **79.12**  | **77.97** |\n| **\u0394 (Ours - Multi-Level)** | +0.28     | +0.66     | +0.39     | +0.68      | +0.53     |\n\nOur method demonstrates significant improvements in performance across five architectures, especially in heterogeneous and homogenous settings, when we apply settings of multi-level logit distillation. DKD [2] further supports such improvement while using auto-augmentation. These results are added in the revised paper.\n\n# Results on ViT\n\nThank you for your insightful review and for expressing interest in the potential application of our LumiNet method on Vision Transformers (ViTs). We appreciate the suggestion to explore and demonstrate the advantages of LumiNet in the context of ViTs, in addition to convolution-based methods.\n\nInitially, our experiments were focused on convolution-based methods, primarily because the benchmark we utilized is widely recognized and accepted in the research community. Moreover, none of the compared methods in our study had been applied to ViTs, which influenced our initial experimental design. However, we acknowledge the importance and relevance of extending our evaluation to include ViTs. We concur that demonstrating LumiNet's effectiveness on ViTs, similar to its performance on convolution-based networks, would significantly strengthen its applicability and acceptance in diverse scenarios.\n\nOur study evaluated LumiNet with traditional knowledge distillation technique using the CIFAR-100 dataset, operating within a ViT setup. Here, the teacher network is a variant of ViT with 21.3 million parameters, and the student model is a more compact version with approximately 2.38 million parameters. Our findings were quite promising. The improvement margin observed with LumiNet was substantial, as shown in the table below. This suggests that LumiNet excels in convolution-based architectures and holds considerable potential for enhancing performance in ViT. We have used the setting followed by Wang, Jiahao, et al. [3]. These results are added in the revised paper.\n\n## Table B. Performance on the CIFAR Dataset Using ViT\n\n| Algorithm             | FLOPS  | #params | CIFAR-100 |\n|-----------------------|--------|---------|-----------|\n| Teacher               | ~1.38G | ~21.3M  | 76.30%    |\n| Student               | ~153M  | ~2.38M  | 65.46%    |\n| Knowledge Distillation| ~153M  | ~2.38M  | 67.38%    |\n| Ours                  |  ~153M | ~2.38M  | 68.42%    |\n\nWe hope this response addresses your query and demonstrates our commitment to thoroughly exploring and validating the efficacy of LumiNet across various neural network architectures. \n\n\n**References**\n1.
