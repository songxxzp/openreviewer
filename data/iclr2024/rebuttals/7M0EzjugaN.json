We respectfully argue that it may not be trivial for the user to know when to switch to a new task. For example, when the data is injected in a Gaussian scheduled *continuous* scenario [1], the data distribution imperceptibly changes over time as there are no explicit task boundaries, and even the user cannot tell where the task boundary is. To address a large set of scenarios including the ones mentioned above, we devise a *task-free* method.\n\n[1] Murray Shanahan, Christos Kaplanis, and Jovana Mitrovic.

                        "value": "> Another baseline I could think of is to use the loss as the weight to dynamically change the old logits. What are some intuitions on why confidence is better than loss to use to dynamically weight?\n\n$\\to$ Interesting suggestion! While using loss values can potentially serve as a strong baseline as the reviewer mentioned, we choose to use confidence scores considering the aspects below.\n\nFirst, while a confidence score ranges from 0 to 1, the loss functions usually have unbounded ranges. For the weighted moving average, the weights are expected to be in the range from 0 to 1 and the sum of the weights becomes 1. Therefore, it is not suitable to use the unbounded loss value as the weight. As an alternative, we use the confidences which are bounded.\n\nSecond, employing the loss may result in marginal updates to the stored logit, especially in the early stages of training. This leads to a slow improvement of teacher logits for distillation. On the other hand, using confidence enables quicker updates with well-learned logits, leading to a rapid update to more informative logits. This is because widely used loss functions adopt log-based functions of probability such as cross-entropy losses, while confidences are probability values themselves. Due to the logarithmic scale of loss functions, loss values obtained by low probabilities could be quite small, and thus, the moving average with such small values might lead to marginal updates on the logits. As we can see in Figure 3, the confidence of a stored logit and a newly encountered logit is near 0, *i.e.*, the prediction probability of a stored logit and the newly introduced logit is $p$ and $p+\\epsilon$, respectively, where $p$ and $\\epsilon$ is positive but near 0.  In this case,  a stored logit needs to be updated using a newly introduced logit (*i.e.*, logits obtained by a model that is slightly more trained) since a logit with a high probability of the ground truth label implies that it learned well about that class, as we mentioned above. However, if we use the loss as a criterion of CAMA, the stored logit will be marginally updated since ($log(p)$) becomes nearly infinite when $p$ is near 0 in  (*i.e.*, $\\gamma \\approx 0$). In contrast, since confidences are probability values themselves, they can be updated more quickly with better logits during the early stages of training, leading to a faster improvement in distillation performance.\n\n> equation (1), the $\\gamma$ in front of $z$ is it missing the subscript $a$ and $c$? or is it a fixed value?\n\n$\\to$ Yes, the subscripts of $a$ and $c$ were missing in $\\gamma$ and we corrected them in the revision. Thank you for pointing this out.\n\n> for equation (2), how are the confidence scores calculated, mathematically\n\n$\\to$ Let $s^a_{i,k}$ a $k^{th}$ recent confidence score of an action, $i$, for the ground truth class $i$. We compute the averaged confidence score of the class, $i$, as, $\\bar{s}^a_i = \\sum_{k=1}^N s^a_{i,k}$. \n\nSimilarly, let $s^c_{j,l}$ a $l^{th}$ recent confidence score of an object class, $j$, for the ground truth and we compute the averaged confidence score of the object class, $j$, as, $\\bar{s}^c_j = \\sum_{l=1}^N s^c_{j,l}$.\n\n> I am not too familiar with the benchmark, but when is the object class used when making decisions? if you need to heat a mug, does your agent also need to recognize the object in front of it is a mug too?\n\n$\\to$ Yes, the agent needs to recognize the object (*i.e.*, a mug) in front of it and predict the object class, \u201cmug,\u201d if the agent intends to interact (*e.g.*, pick up, put, *etc.*) with it."

It adapts a distillation based approach that was developed for the setting with task boundaries. Prior methods store past model logits in memory and update these with a weighting scheme to prevent these logits of becoming outdated using task boundary information. Here the weights are determined dynamically via the confidence of the past N predictions of the model, not relying on task boundary information. The method shows improved task performance compared to a variety of continual learning baselines in a simulated household environment. The evaluation is split into a setting where the agents has to continually learn new behaviors and a setting where the agent has to continually adapt to new environments."

We utilize confidence scores of only the *correct* classes (*i.e.*, ground-truth classes), thus there are no detrimental occurring due to the overconfidence problem. \n\n> Abstract, last sentence: \u201coutperforms prior arts\u201d, was that supposed to be \u201coutperforms prior state of the art\u201d?\n\n$\\to$ Prior art and the state of the art are regarded as synonym (Please refer to the \u2018Patent Law\u2019 section of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art).

Why is the performance on the $SR_{avg}$.\u201d (please correct us if we are wrong). The $SR_{avg}$ and $GC_{avg}$ metrics *do not* require the usage of memory. In other words, we measure metrics (*i.e.*, SR and GC) whenever right before receiving samples of a new behavior or environment and take the average of the metrics obtained at the end of each behavior or environment.\n\n> Which episodes are stored in the memory M? Is it simply a queue? If yes then given that its capacity is such a small percentage of the total number of episodes (as said in the text that is the standard) and given the number of tasks for each of the evaluation episodes will most episodes not be about the same task such that the logits there should be replaced with the current logits of the model?\n\n$\\to$ The memory used is not a queue but an $M$-dimension array that does not have any temporal dependency on the order of incoming and outcoming examples. To address the concern that the current episodes may use the majority of memory space as the reviewer pointed out, we adopt reservoir sampling (Vitter et al., 1985, Rolnick et al., 2019, Buzzega et al., 2020) that enables us to maintain the stored episodes in memory approximately uniform across sequential tasks (*i.e.*, behaviors and environments)."

We observe that 'CAMA w/o D.C.\u2019 achieves slightly better performance values than 'CAMA\u2019 in some metrics (*e.g.*, Val. Unseen $SR_{last}\\uparrow$).

                        "value": "We thank reviewer UTbC for the constructive feedback and the encouraging remarks on tackling a challenging problem and an interesting and powerful idea. We address your concerns as follows.\n\n> I think some of the assumptions this paper makes are not realistic. E.g., the paper indicates that this approach is task-free and that task-identifiers are not available, but it appears to assume that the data is balanced. But in a real-world continual learning setup, there is no guarantee that the tasks/data the agent encounters will be balanced, and so if data balance is enforced via sub-sampling I think this is implicitly leaking information regarding task identifiers (as they would be needed to balance an unbalanced dataset in practice).\n\n$\\to$ For data balance, we follow common practice in previous continual learning literature (Wu et al., 2019, Aljundi et al., 2019, Bang et al., 2021, Boschini et al., 2022).  However, we agree with the reviewer in that we have no guarantee that the data that the agent encounters will be balanced. To investigate the imbalance scenario as suggested, we are performing additional experiments by removing the subsampling process in the Environment-IL setup and we will upload the result in the revision.\n\nAlthough we balance the training and evaluation episodes, we *do not* exploit any task-specific information or identifiers during the training and evaluation process, thus believe there is no information leakage. Since we denote by \u2018task-free\u2019 the absence of task identifiers *during the training process* (Aljundi et al., 2019), not task identifiers themselves. We added a discussion about task-free continual learning setups in \u201cTask-free continual learning setups\u201d in Sec. 2 of the revision.\n\nTo consider a data-imbalance scenario, we consider *intra-task* imbalance, *i.e.*, an imbalance between object and action classes in each task to construct our proposed incremental setups. For *inter-task* balance, we followed previous works (Wu et al., 2019, Aljundi et al., 2019, Bang et al., 2021, Boschini et al., 2022) that assume balanced distribution between tasks (*i.e.*, assuming inter-task balance) for simplicity of setups. To mitigate severe inter-task imbalance in the environments in the ALFRED benchmark, we subsample the same number of episodes across all environments for inter-task balance.\n\nHowever, we agree that there is no guarantee of encountering inter-task-balanced data. To investigate our approach in such inter-task imbalance, we construct a modified version of the Environment-IL setup by omitting subsampling and summarize the result in Sec. E.1 of the revision. In this setup, an environment type (*i.e.*, Kitchens) has three times more episodes than the other environment types and thus, this setup considers inter-task imbalance as well.\n\n> An analysis on how class/environment/behavior imbalance affects the model would be beneficial here.\n\n$\\to$ As the reviewer suggested, we are performing additional experiments on the Environment-IL setup with imbalances between environments (*i.e.*, without subsampling). We will upload the revision with the results soon."

                        "value": "> The performance improvements seem relatively marginal for many of the evaluation metrics. Were any statistical significance results run over these values?\n\n$\\to$ We also agree that the performance improvements seem relatively marginal, possibly due to large standard errors. Even though we increase the random seed, the magnitude of standard errors does not decrease well. We believe that this is because class distributions of task data are imbalanced in an incremental setup in embodied tasks, while balanced in existing class incremental setup in image classification tasks, and it amplifies the performance difference based on the order of tasks. More specifically, some tasks may share relatively many action and object classes, while others may share fewer classes. Previously learning such shared action and object classes may help better learning the current task (*i.e.*, forward transfer) and this implies that a model\u2019s performance may depend on the order of the tasks (*i.e.*, how much the model learns the shared action and object classes ahead). \n\nFor example, when learning to cool an object, acquiring knowledge of actions (such as opening/closing a fridge) and object classes (like apples, tomatoes, etc.) can also be used for subsequent learning to heat an object (e.g., heating an 'apple,' a 'tomato,' etc. by 'opening/closing' a microwave). We empirically observe that for the behavior, \u2018Heat,\u2019 our agent achieves 3.70% Valid Unseen SR after learning the behavior, \u2018Cool,\u2019 while it achieves zero Valid Unseen SR after learning the behavior, \u2018Examine,\u2019 which does have fewer shared object classes as illustrated in Figure 6 in Sec. E.2 in the appendix, implying the dependency of performance on a task order.\n\nWhile we agree that the performance improvements look marginal, we would like to note that a success rate (SR), the main metric that we use as much embodied AI work does, follows a *strict* evaluation protocol: a task is regarded as succeeded *only if* all the goal conditions are met and therefore, we may not observe significant improvements in the SR metric even if a model achieves some improvements in various aspects such as environmental representation [1] and language variation [2]. Sole comparison in this strict metric with significance test may pay less attention to these aspects, though they are valuable.\n\n[1] Gadre et al. Continuous scene representations for embodied AI.

ICPR, 2022.\n\n\n> The training methodology is not entirely clear to me, and I think some of it should be pulled into the main paper as it reduces the clarity of the empirical results.\n\n$\\to$ We are sorry for the confusion. We address the questions below and add them in \u201cEvaluation metrics\u201d in Sec. 5 in the revision. Thank you for pointing this out.\n\n>> Are all the models trained sequentially over a set of tasks/environments and then evaluated over the same set (in the seen case)?\n\n$\\to$ Partly, yes. All the models are trained sequentially over a set of tasks/environments but evaluated over *the episodes of the tasks/environments that the models have learned so far*. For example, if the model learned about the kitchen and bathroom, the evaluation set will only include data that is performed in the kitchen and bathroom (*i.e.*, not including the living room and the bedroom). For evaluation, we use episodes different from those used for training.\n\n>> Do the seen/unseen evaluations use the same underlying trained model?\n\n$\\to$ Yes, we use the same trained model for both *seen* and *unseen* evaluations."

I see reference to random ordered sequences in Sec.

To avoid favoring a particular order of the behaviors and environments, we validate our method with multiple random orders and report their mean and standard error ( sentence in Sec. 3.2.1).\n\nFor the training/evaluation methodology, we use the same training and evaluation method across the entire randomly ordered sequences (*i.e.*, it does not require any additional tuning for a specific order), which enables our method to be applied to arbitrary sequences of the behaviors and environments.\n\n\n> Is there any insight on how the size of the memory buffer relates to the number of learning tasks? Is 500 an arbitrary number or was this empirical chosen?\n\n$\\to$ We set the memory size to *less than 5%* of the training dataset following a common practice on continual learning literature (Prabhu et al., 2020; Bang et al., 2021; Koh et al., 2022; 2023). Specifically, we set our memory size to 500, which is approximately 2.38% of the training episodes in the ALFRED benchmark."

E1 is a class frequency histogram.\n\n$\\to$ Yes, we have the quantitative result for an updated imbalance dataset in the table below, as we promised in our previous answer. We construct the imbalance dataset by removing the subsampling process used in the Environment-IL setup, resulting in imbalanced numbers of episodes across all environments. We observe that even with such an imbalance, our CAMA still outperforms the best-performing baseline (DER++) by noticeable margins. In particular, we observe significant improvements of $SR_{avg}$ and $GC_{avg}$ in both valid seen and unseen splits. We summarize the results in Table 3 in Sec.D.6 of the revision. We will add the results of the other baselines in the final manuscript.\n\n**Table A. The imbalanced Environment-IL setup.**\n| Model | Val. Seen $SR_{last}\\uparrow$ | Val.

Then, the authors proposed a new approach for weighting the new logits and old logits. Specifically, a confidence-aware moving average approach which updates logits based on confidence scores of class labels is proposed.

Giving simple examples that demonstrate the effectiveness could be very helpful.\n\n$\\to$ We argue that the confidence score partially estimates how well the model has learned about respective classes by which we define the `quality\u2019 of the logit, similar to previous work measures confidence as a metric for the informativeness of stored prior models for distillation (*i.e.*, high confidence of the past model implies that there is much information to distill from the previous model) (Koh et al., 2023). \n\nFor example, If the model $p$ predicts $p(i) = 1$ for the class $i$, it implies that the model has learned the class $i$ well, *i.e.*, it may contain ample information about the class $i$. Conversely, if the model predicts $p(i) = 0$, it implies that the model has yet learned the class $i$, *i.e.*, it may contain little information about the class $i$. We add this discussion in Sec. E.1 in the appendix in the revision.\n\n>> The behavior $t_i$ of the current episode is different from the behavior $t_j$ that is associated with the sampled past experience $x\u2019$. Why would confidence scores of current episodes with behavior provide information on a different behavior $t_j$. .\n\n$\\to$ We believe that the confidence scores of the current episodes with a behavior, $t_i$, can provide information on a different behavior, $t_j$, because the actions (*e.g.*, turn left, pick up, *etc.*) and object classes (*e.g.*, apple, pen, *etc.*) learned for the current task (*i.e.*, behavior and environment) can be also used for the previous tasks and therefore, achieving high accuracy of the actions and object classes for the current task can positively affect the previous tasks. For example, an agent that previously learned how to heat a mug may now learn to move two mugs on the table for the current task. To complete the current task, the agent should first learn to plan actions (*e.g.*, turn left/right, move ahead, pick up, *etc.*) and predict relevant object classes (*e.g.*, mug) to reach and interact with a mug. It is noteworthy that these learned actions and object classes are also used for the previous task (*i.e.*, heat a mug) as the agent should also reach and interact with a mug to heat it. \n\n> In equation (1), subscripts $a$, $c$ are missing in $\\gamma_a$ and $\\gamma_c$.\n\n$\\to$ Thank you for the comment!. We revised the equation (1) ($\\gamma$ -> $\\gamma_a$, $\\gamma$ -> $\\gamma_c$) in the revision.\n\n> This paper uses imitation learning to train the agents. Is the proposed approach extendable to a reinforcement learning setting?\n\n$\\to$ Great suggestion! Yes, our proposed approach can be extendable to a reinforcement learning setting. Once an action logit, $z_{old,a}'$, is stored in episodic memory for the current state, $s$, and action, $a$, the next state, $s\u2019$, and the corresponding reward, $r$, resulting in the form of $(s, a, s\u2019, r)$, we can maintain $(s, a, s\u2019, r, z_{old,a}')$ and given a new logit, $z_a'$, for the same current state, we can update the previous logit, $z_{old,a}'$, in the same way as CAMA, resulting in $(s, a, s\u2019, r, z_{new,a}')$ where $z_{new,a}'$$ = (1-\\gamma_a) z_{old,a}' + \\gamma_a z_a'(z_{new,c}'$ can be updated in the same way if applicable). Note that we do not assume the usage of imitation learning for training."
