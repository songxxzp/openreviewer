Based on that, the authors propose a simple yet effective framework called dBOT to learn strong self-supervised visual representation."

Therefore, does that suggest that the observed conclusion only mask sense with a fixed dataset with long enough training? \n  - In other words, is the bottleneck of scalable visual representation learning not about the methodology but more about data?\n- About asymmetric masking:\n  - Following my question above, another perspective to understand this phenomenon is due to the limited scalability [1] of asymmetric masking architecture proposed in MAE, which is also utilized as the main architecture in this work. While in Swinv2 and EVA, the MIM pre-training has been quite important for ViT training of giant sizes. Does the implementation of masking also affect the scalability of pre-training?\n  - Moreover, does the invariance of target representation suggest masking operation is the key in MKD, which might also explain why the learnt representation has similar weight distribution?\n- About backbone architecture:\n  - Throughout the whole paper, the authors utilize the vanilla ViT of different sizes for both the student and teacher networks, while DeiT has shown that architecture discrepancy exists when distilling  between different architectures like CNN and ViT. Will that be the same for MKD, like does the phenomenon still hold with a ConvNext teacher?\n- Overall, I think this is a quite interesting paper, and my questions are more open-ended to further enhance the insight of the observed phenomenon for future development.\n\n[1] Zhai, Xiaohua, et al. \"Scaling vision transformers.\" *Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*. 2022."

                        "value": "Thanks for your valuable comments and your appreciation for our technical contributions. We will fix the typos. Below, we discuss in detail the points you have raised.\n\n**Q1: Is the bottleneck of scalable visual representation learning not about the methodology but more about data?**\n\nIn our paper, we conducted experiments with the same dataset (IN-1K) and the same setting (multi-stage distillation). We specifically focused on masked knowledge distillation, which utilizes masked image modeling as the pretext task for self-supervised training. We observed that the target representation is not crucial for mask knowledge distillation when distillation is performed in stages. However, we believe that new sophisticated pretext tasks can further enhance the performance. The bottleneck of scalable visual representation learning arises from both methodology and data.\n\n**Q2: Does the invariance of target representation suggest that the masking operation is the key in MKD? Does the implementation of masking also affect the scalability of pre-training?**\n\nThe masking operation is indeed the key in masked knowledge distillation for self-supervised learning. Through the same pre-training task, the target representation is not important in multi-stage distillation, and dBOT can achieve a similar weight distribution. The implementation of masking also affects the scalability of pre-training. Like MAE, even changing the mask ratio can affect the model performance, as shown in our ablation study.\n\n**Q3: More backbone architecture.**\n\nIn our experiment, we used the same architecture for both the student and teacher networks, as the teacher's weights are loaded from the pre-stage student's weights in multi-stage distillation. Therefore, the teacher and student networks should be the same. Previous works such as DINO and DALL-E were pre-trained on vanilla VIT, which facilitated our study on masked knowledge distillation with vanilla VIT as the backbone. As you mentioned ConvNext, a possible experiment would involve performing DINO and DALL-E on ConvNext first, and then applying masked knowledge distillation. However, whether DINO and DALL-E are suitable for ConvNext is a question that goes beyond the scope of our paper. We would like to leave this as an open-ended question.\n\nWe appreciate your valuable feedback and will continue to explore and expand the scope of our work."

I do agree with Reviewer aTJx that the phenomenon of \"target representation not important\" is probably just another \"fancy story\" to demonstrate that MIM still does not scale very well, especially after a long enough (i.e., multi-stage) mask pre-training (i.e. MKD) procedure on the ImageNet-1K dataset. We still do not know how to improve the scalability, but perhaps this paper helps us exclude one candidate option. I would like to see the pinions of other reviewers for my final decision."

However, this is not clearly stated in the main paper.\n\n2.  A While the authors mention the instability and sensitivity of other methods, it should be noted that MKD also requires careful pipeline design and hyper-parameter selection. For example,  MAE with fixed m (momentum updating teacher\u2019s param) can achieve 84.3 at stage 2, however, in most cases in the ablation, MKD only outperforms MAE when the stage split number, epochs for each stage, and momentum parameter (m) and others are correctly set. This limits the practical application of MKD. This limits the practical application of MKD, as one could simply distill MAE for two stages with less time consumption and similar performance.\n\n3. The paper only explores the fine-tune setting of semi-supervised learning (SSL), which diminishes the differences between pre-training models. How about the linear-probe setting? Would teachers also matter? Additionally, it is unclear whether the models mentioned in Section 6 are supervisedly fine-tuned on IN or pre-trained models before fine-tuning.\n\n4. A minor weakness of the paper is that only l2 distillation is performed, neglecting other potential distillation methods."

Below, we discuss in detail the points you have raised.\n\n**Q1: Technical details.**\n\nIn our pre-training and fine-tuning, we use IN-1K as the dataset and masked autoencoder as the student models. This is described in section 3 (common setup). We will clearly state the technical details in our revised version.\n\n**Q2: The hyper-parameter setting.**\n\nThe setting for distilling MAE in the two-stage process is selected based on the ablation in section 5.4. In Table 1, all the results are set the same for a fair comparison. Distilling the mask autoencoder for two stages with any teacher achieves similar performance in classification, object detection, and segmentation.\n\n**Q3: Linear probing results and the details in section 6.**\n\nThe linear probing results of dBOT using DINO as the teacher are 77.35%, while dBOT using other teachers achieves similar results (69.1%). We attribute this to the multi-crop technique and contrastive learning used in DINO. In section 6, all the models are pre-trained models before fine-tuning.\n\n**Q4: The meaning of recipe \u2697**\n\nThe token \u2697 represents the distillation of dBOT with CLIP as the teacher, as described in appendix C.1. We will clearly state this in the revised version.\n\nWe are investigating dBOT's effectiveness in other potential distillation methods except for l2 distillation. We appreciate your valuable feedback and will continue to explore and expand the scope of our work."

Given that the performance on different downstream tasks peaks at different stages (Table 1), it is not clear how to choose the number of distillation stages to arrive at a single general model that can work across tasks (even beyond the ones discussed - eg. for embodied navigation [1]). \n3. **Do the trends hold across random seeds?**. For a single random initialized teacher, Table 1 shows 2 stage being better for classification and stage 3 being better for detection/segmentation. It is not clear if trends like this (and the performance) hold across random seeds.\n\n[1] Offline Visual Representation Learning for Embodied Navigation. Yadav et al. 2022."

                        "value": "Thanks for your valuable comments and your appreciation for our technical contributions. We will improve our draft following your suggestions. Below, we discuss in detail the points you have raised.\n\n**Q1: Does performance saturate and not drop with more stages and training?**\n\nWe perform multi-stage training using pixels as the target. The fine-tuning performance on IN-1K at the 0th, 1st, 2nd, and 3rd stages is 83.6, 84.3, 84.4, and 84.3, respectively. The performance saturates after two-stage distillation and fluctuates around the saturation performance.\n\n**Q2: Different models for different tasks.**\n\nAs we explained in response to Q1, the performance will fluctuate around the saturation performance. Downstream users can load any model after two-stage distillation with a slight performance difference.\n\n**Q3: Do the trends hold across random seeds?**\n\nDuring our experiments, we found that the performance of classification and detection is quite stable, except for the segmentation tasks. The segmentation performance reported in our paper is averaged over 5 random seeds, which we will clearly state in our revised version.\n\n**Q4: Is the total number of pre-training iterations controlled across different methods in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5?**\n\nIn Table 5, we conducted ablation studies to choose the best settings for dBOT. Then, the best setting was used in Tables 2, 3, and 4. The model performance saturates after multi-stage distillation.\n\n**Q5: Why is MAE faster than dBOT when both use an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture?**\n\nMAE uses the original pixel as the target, which does not involve a teacher network, while dBOT uses an extra teacher to extract the reconstructed token.\n\n**Q6: It seems like MAE's attention distance plot is similar to the distilled models'.**\n\nThey are similar but there are differences between them. Taking the last layer as an example, the maximum average attention distance for MAE is 85, while it is 70 for dBOT. The minimum average attention distance for MAE is 40, while it is 30 for dBOT. dBOT achieves more local attention than previous works.\n\n**Q7: Shouldn't a lesser correlation in the model's output result in lower redundancy?**\n\nWe apologize for this mistake and will correct it in the revised version.\n\n**Q8: Why may the \"existence of decoder\" hurt?**\n\nThe encoder and decoder are both used in the pre-training stage, but the decoder is discarded in the fine-tuning stage. When the target is low-level, the decoder is needed to decode the high-level representations encoded by the encoder. However, when the target contains high-level semantics, the existence of the decoder may even restrain the encoder from fully grasping knowledge from the teacher, leading to degraded performance.\n\nWe appreciate your valuable feedback and will continue to explore and expand the scope of our work."

For instance, if the teacher network is switched in to some other pretrained networks, I feel confident that this dBOT pipeline would still perform good.\n\n2. The observation of the insignificance of the choice of teacher network is somewhat aligned to the observation of MAE, which simply opts for raw image pixels and surpasses previous methods like BeiT or MaskFeat with more sophisticated target representation by a non-trivial margin. This is also validated from the results in appendix B.1, which shows *using the patch token obtained by a randomly initialized network as the target can achieve comparable results with a pixel as a target.*\n\n3. The authors claim that *Using a random model as teachers not only avoids an extra pre-training stage, but also alleviates the painstaking selection of the target representations*. But I think this has already been achieved by MAE, since reconstrucing raw image pixels does not involve pretraining, and there is no need to select target representations. Thus, I am not sure what is the practical value of the observation of this work."

                        "value": "Thanks for your valuable comments. Below, we discuss in detail the points you have raised.\n\n**Q1: The relation between dBOT and the observation about the choice of teacher model.**\n\nIndeed, the performance of dBOT comes from the multi-stage training. The major finding in our paper is that the choice of the teacher model does not have to be carefully chosen if the distillation is done in stages. Specifically, we use a randomly initialized model as a teacher to formulate dBOT and compare the results with previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. dBOT still performs well when switching teacher networks since the choice of the teacher model is not crucial.\n\n**Q2: The observation is somewhat aligned with the observation of MAE.**\n\nIn the early stages of Masked Image Modeling (MIM), researchers used different targets for performing MIM, such as pixels, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), and tokens from a pre-trained teacher. Researchers have different opinions on target selection and different results are achieved with different targets. MAE simplifies MIM by using pixels as the target and achieves better results than Beit and maskfeat, which demonstrates that using pixels is better than HOG and tokens from a pre-trained teacher. However, our paper finds that the choice of the teacher network is not crucial if the distillation is done in stages. In other words, similar results can be achieved by using any target (as shown in Table 1), even a randomly initialized teacher. This is the main difference between dBOT and MAE.\n\n**Q3: Reconstructing raw pixels.**\n\nMAE achieves good results by simply using pixels as a target. However, later works, like [1], achieve better results by using tokens from pre-trained teachers as targets. Different results are achieved with different targets. The motivation of our paper is that there is no work that provides a system-level study on the importance of how to choose an adequate target representation or teacher network to guide the learning of Masked Knowledge Distillation (MKD). Our work reveals that the choice of teacher is not crucial if the distillation is done in stages. In particular, we find that using a randomly initialized model as a teacher can achieve similar results through multi-stage distillation, which we formulate as dBOT. This alleviates the painstaking selection of target representations since we achieve similar performances with different target representations in multi-stage distillation.\n\n**Q4: The results of randomly initialized teacher.**\n\nThe results of the 0th stage are the initialized teacher, and the results of the 1st and 2nd stages are the distilled student, which is described in Section 3.1. Therefore, 77.1 is the result of fine-tuning a randomly initialized model on IN-1K.\n\n[1] Wei, Yixuan, et al. \"Contrastive learning rivals masked image modeling in fine-tuning via feature distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14141 (2022)."

                        "value": "Here we would like to highlight the main contributions:\n\na) **Pioneering System-Level Study in MIM with dBOT**: Our work, dBOT, stands as the first to conduct a system-level study on the role of the 'teacher' in Masked Image Modeling (MIM). While previous studies (such as MAE, MaskFeat, and MVP) suggest that the choice of target may not be pivotal for MIM's success, this hypothesis remained untested. dBOT is the first to empirically demonstrate this, marking the first contribution in the field.\n\nb) **Highlighting the Importance of Multi-Stage Masked Distillation**: We reveal that the key to effectively training high-capacity models lies in our novel multi-stage masked distillation pipeline, rather than in the meticulous selection of a training target. This approach contrasts with the typical one-stage training methodology prevalent in prior research, marking another contribution of this work.\n\nWe are eager to engage in further discussions and questions!"

                        "value": "Thanks for your prompt reply! I appreciate the potential effort it might take.\n\nHowever, after reading the authors' response, and opinions from other reviewers, I still feel this work has the following weakness:\n\n(1) As agreed by the authors, the superior performance of dBOT comes from its multi-stage training design, not from its analysis about the role of pre-trained teacher model. I feel not so comfortable that this paper tries to pitch its analysis \"target representation\" as the main driving force of its performance, as they are somewhat unrelated.\n\n(2) I agree that dBOT performs extensive analysis on the role of pre-trained teacher model in MIM, which is different from the raw pixel construction in MAE. However, I doubt if those analysis is really valuable, after MAE has proved that there is **no need** for such a pre-trained teacher. Indeed, as pointed out by Reviewer tvFW, dBOT is even slower than MAE due to its adoption of a teacher model. Plus, as I said earlier, there is *no painstaking selection of the target representations* if there is no teacher.\n\n(3) Following (2), one could argue that the fearetus extracted by a randomly initialized teacher is somewhat similar to raw pixels in the MIM framework, which is why those seemingly random features could work in the first place.\n\n(4) I checked [1] as the authors pointed out it *achieves better results by using tokens from pre-trained teachers as targets*. However, if my understanding is correct, [1] focuses on improving contrastive learning to the level of MAE by adopting stronger CLIP pre-trained teacher models. It is **not** a work of MIM. Hence, I doubt if that work could justify the motivation of this work, especially after there is already MAE. In other words, I cannot see any sign why we should adopt any teacher for targer representation in MIM. I feel confident that breaking MAE training into multiple stages would lead to just as good performance.\n\n\nMy original review continues to apply.\n\n\n[1] Wei, Yixuan, et al. \"Contrastive learning rivals masked image modeling in fine-tuning via feature distillation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14141 (2022)."
