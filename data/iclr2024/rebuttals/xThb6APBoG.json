The topic itself is standard and has a lot of literature. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal to treat query-item as the state which can address some disadvantages of large action space. Some theoretical analysis is provided. The paper also use LLMs as the reward model. For experiments, one public dataset and one internal dataset is used. Basic baselines are compared against and the proposed method shows some performance benefits."

There are numerous retrieval datasets and strong baselines and it is not clear why the authors selected the datasets (1 public dataset that is not commonly used) and an internal dataset, and pretty much without any sensible baselines. Especially for the recall metric, it is standard so it\u2019s not clear why no standard baselines or datasets are used. The internal dataset does not add much value to the paper, as the details are unclear, will not help reproducibility, and the real-world impact is not clear given no online experiments. There are many ways to compose a task that do not optimize recall metric so it is not clear why such task is chosen. The authors implemented the basic base models themselves. The choices also look arbitrary, such as the choice of certain model architectures, the LLMs used (while assuming they are reliable which is not the case - despite recent papers on the popular topic, they hardly beat previous tuning methods). All these will make the impact of the work hard to be measured and the reproducibility of the proposed method extremely difficult.  \n\nW2: RL in information retrieval has a very rich literature, and optimizing arbitrary metric is inherited from RL, so the novelty/story from this perspective is limited. The major contribution is really the algorithm mentioned in S1, but the significance of the proposed method is unclear."

Most RL work in information retrieval focuses on tens of actions, whereas our method can scale to millions of actions.\n3.

The paper proposes using an LLM as a reward oracle for an additional reinforcement learning stage that would fine tune a model trained on labelled data, and further aligns the ranking model with the task at hand, more so than it would be able to learn from just the offline training data.\n\nThe performance of the new algorithm is highlighted on two datasets,  one publicly available, the other proprietary. The experiments show the fine-tuned algorithm exceeding the performance of the supervised model, but falling short of reaching the performance of the model used as an oracle (in this case the LLM)"

Fine-tuning supervised models with a reinforcement learning phase is a well-known approach. Once it has been established that LLMs are suitable for labelling data for this sort of problems relatively reliably, using RL for fine-tuning does not feel like a novel contribution. It is also unclear how good the LLMs are at aligning the fine-tuning objective to the objective we are actually aiming to solve. For instance, if the criteria is diversity etc.\n\nThe reframing of the problem as having two action spaces is a bit unclear to me as to how it alleviates the complexity of the setting. I also fail to see how the problem is still cast as an MDP for the theoretical results to hold. This should be clearly articulated in the main body of the paper."

In light of all these possible alternatives, what are the reason to believe using the REINFORCE algorithm for the fine-tuning step is an impactful approach and not just another approach?\n\nCan you better describe the intuition why the convergence speed of the algorithm is substantially increased from framing the problem as having the states being pairs <state, item> and having binary actions?\n\nIn addition to the above explanation, I would also like to see a detailed formal description of the resulting MDP and the application of the Theorem in Mei et al. (2020) to the resulting setting. It is unclear to me what this MDP would look like and how the theorem applies.\n\nCan you provide an interpretation of how impactful the $0.2\\\\%$ increase in the click yield is? \n\n[1] - https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02763\n[2] - https://proceedings.mlr.press/v115/hiranandani20a/hiranandani20a.pdf\n[3] - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-020-05877-5"

Compared to positive-unlabelled or active learning setting, the benefit of RL is that we can optimize any non-differentiable loss. Contextual Bandits do not scale well to millions of actions. Most such approaches optimize over tens of items whereas our problem considers optimization over millions of items.\n\n2. The intuition is that the convergence depends quadratically on number of actions and linearly in the number of states. So, our setup reduces the actions while increasing the number of states; the net result is a substantial increase in convergence speed.\n\n3. It is a one-step MDP. In each round, a state (<query, item>) is sampled, an action is taken (0/1), and the environment provides the reward. It can be understood as a contextual bandit setup.\n\n4.

For example, it is not clear where the relevance oracle is coming from is it small set of annotations, or an LLM reward/relevance estimator?\n\n3- For QADSM, the reward model seems rather small, especially compared to typical embedding models used for the retrieval. My understanding is that the reward model can/should actually be orders of magnitude larger and more capable to generate best supervision signal for the embedding model training. Any reason authors decided to use a variation of T5-base?\n\n4- On the same topic, I see GPY-4/3.5 is used for the other dataset, isn\u2019t it more intuitive to finetune an LLM for the specific relevance estimation task? any results/experiments to support using a strong but generic model?"

We use t5-base since its accuracy was already good on the dataset. It may be even more powerful to use a bigger model.\n3. Agree. It will be ideal to finetune an LLM for each task. However, we found that GPT-3.5 provides good accuracy through a simple prompt. For QADSM, we could have used GPT-3.5 too but found that a t5-base model gave reasonable results too. So we choose t5-base to demonstrate that our method is not reliant on (costly) access to GPT-3.5.\n4. The learned embedding model will have generalization. As long as the model to encode keywords is fixed, the same trained model for queries can be used.  In other words, our method, PGRetrieve, can be considered as an *offline RL* training method. Once trained, the model is used in an identical fashion to a model learnt using supervised learning."

More empirical results is needed to show the method actually works. Please consider add comparisons with SOTA retrieval method on more widely used retrieval benchmarks.\n* The paper utilizes other pre-trained LLM models as relevance oracle which introduces additional supervision. I am not sure if the gain in recall comes from the reinforcement fine-tuning or simply from getting more supervision from a stronger model. Please consider add ablation study to validate the contribution from each part.\n* From section 4.3, seems it is required to compute all query-document pairs in order to sample the states. This is computationally intensive and probably infeasible for most real applications. The space to store such dense query-document score matrix could be astronomical.

Since the policy is an encoder model, we found that giving feedback on the topmost ranked items had a larger effect on the gradient than giving feedback on the other items. Therefore, to speed up training, we choose a small k. Note that changing the predictions at small k for a query also imply that predictions at larger k will change, since the encoder model provides a single representation of the query (and the representations for keywords are fixed).\n\n2. Here\u2019s the prompt used. 'Given the query \u201cq\u201d, is the following query expressing the exact same intent, \"k\"? Please answer in a single word: Yes/No.' Note that keyword is also presented as a query to the large language model.\n3.
