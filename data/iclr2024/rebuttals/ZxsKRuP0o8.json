The method proposed in this paper is simply adding an additional self-supervised reconstrution loss into meta-learning, which is trivial. \n- The motivation for using the reconstruction loss is not clear. The proposed method can be used for common classification tasks as well, so what makes it special to work for few-shot learning?\n- The writing of the paper needs significant improvement. The paper is like a draft or a project in the university. For example, Figure 1,2,3 are very similar and should be put into one figure. Descriptions of the method can be much shorter. The definition of regularization needs to be clarified more. The logic of the paper needs to be rearranged.\n- The experiments only show that the additional loss can improve meta-learning's performance. However, no other methods are compared, making it hard to put the method into the context of the literature. Also, ablation study is missing.\n\n[1] Boosting Few-Shot Classification with View-Learnable Contrastive Learning. ICME 2021.\n\n[2] Boosting Few-Shot Visual Learning with Self-Supervision.

The authors fail to demonstrate why self-supervision loss can be a good regularization.\n\n4. The experiments are not convinced. 1) This paper appears to propose a general viewpoint: self-supervision can enhance performance in few-shot tasks, but it does not explore various self-supervision methods and few-shot methods for a more comprehensive comparison and evaluation. 2) Lack of essential ablative experiments: It is possible that the Auto-encoder itself is a powerful few-shot learner, which means that the performance of the Auto-encoder may already surpass that of ProtoNet + Auto-encoder. However, the paper itself does not confirm this.\n\n5.
