                    "value": "In this paper, the authors propose a novel backdoor attack using fake clients for federated learning. The fake clients can inject the backdoors into the global model without possessing real local data and achieve the attacking goal while evading most of the existing defenses. Specifically, to ensure the stealthiness of malicious updates and evade detection, they simulate the normal client updates via modeling the historical global model trajectory. Then, for backdoor injection, with the estimated normal updates as a regularization, they optimize the backdoor trigger and manipulate the selected model parameters simultaneously to achieve the attacking goal. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate their method can achieve high attack success rate while being resilient to most defenses."

In practice, the proportion of malicious devices appears to be unrelated to the computational power of the attackers.\n\n2. The proposed method involves solving an optimization problem to maximize the activation of the first neuron during each federated learning epoch. I recommend that the authors not only assess the effectiveness but also the efficiency of their backdoor injection method, comparing it to local training-based backdoor attacks using poisoned data. Additionally, considering pruning-based backdoor defense mechanisms like [1] and [2], which can eliminate suspected neurons, it would be interesting to evaluate how the proposed attack performs in the presence of such defenses.\n\n3. It's worth noting that historical model updates received from the server can vary significantly from updates of benign clients, especially when aggregation-based defenses are applied or in datasets with a high degree of non-i.i.d. distribution.\n\n4. To provide a comprehensive assessment, I suggest the authors establish baselines by comparing their proposed attack with state-of-the-art backdoor attacks (those mentioned in the related work) that utilize local training. This would help illustrate whether the proposed attack can achieve a similar level of attack effectiveness.\n\n\n[1] Liu, K., Dolan-Gavitt, B. and Garg, S., 2018, September.

However, it would enhance the clarity of the approach to establish a connection, either through theoretical or empirical means, between this optimization and the original backdoor objective outlined in equation (2.2).\n\n2. It is essential to provide more comprehensive details about the baseline methods, specifically the model inversion attack (MI) and the substitution dataset (SD). Explaining the rationale for choosing these particular methods for comparison would further elucidate the comparative analysis.\n\n3. To provide a more comprehensive evaluation, additional ablation studies are warranted. These could encompass exploring the efficiency of the proposed attack, varying the number of fake clients, and assessing its performance under different levels of non-i.i.d. data distribution."

What does it mean unlabeled and labeled here?\n- On **FakeBA can evade fine-tuning** (4.3), \u201cthe server\u2019s labeled data may significantly deviate from those on the clients\u2019 sides\u201d?\n- Results in Figure 1 are on which dataset? CIFAR-10 or TinyImageNet?"
