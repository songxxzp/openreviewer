In fact, only the case of rank-2 order-3 model is considered. Emphasis is placed on the so-called non-orthogonal case when the components are correlated. For this case, the paper propose an algorithm containing the parameter $\\gamma$ for the sequential construction of the desired decomposition. This parameter $\\gamma$ is chosen adaptively by repeatedly running the algorithm. Asymptotics of the decomposition parameters are given as a theoretical analysis. A small number of numerical examples on synthetic data are given."

Section 3.2 MAIN ALGORITHM SKETCH, where the essence of the underlying algorithm is revealed, is overflowing with links to Appendix.\n\n- The paper is widely cited following paper (Seddik et al, 2021), so it is difficult to understand what the current paper is about without reading the cited paper.\n\n- The most important weakness, in my opinion, is too few experiments that have been conducted only on synthetic data. In general, experimental section 4 is very short, subsections 4.2 and 4.3 consist of only figures. Thus, it is not clear at all the relevance of this paper, where practically the presented results can be applied.\n\n- Neither is there any comparison with other existing methods.\n\n- Only rank-2 order-3 model is considered, which significantly reduces the breadth of application of the method and, as a consequence, its practical value."

We have significantly revisited our manuscript, as outlined in our general comment. \n- The main algorithm is motivated and presented in details in Section 3.4, which follows a thorough and complete theoretical construction of our algorithm. We list the main assumptions and theorems, outline their value within our framework and visualize them with adequate simulations. \n- (Seddik et al, 2021) lays the ground to a new angle to approach spectral tensor decomposition problems. Our paper follows the same path to construct our algorithm. While the reader is referred to check that paper for further details about random tensor theory based spectral tensor decomposition (proof of Theorem 1 in Section 3.2.1 of our paper for instance), our paper outlines the detailed construction of all our results in Section 3 of the main paper and provides a self-contained review of concepts of random matrix/tensor theory (RMT/RTT) in Appendix B to guide the unfamiliar reader.\n\n**Experiments.** We update our experiments section, as outlined in our general comment. This further addresses the reviewer's specific questions. We list the relevant section again here for their convenience: \n\n- We now focus our empirical evaluation on two representative experiments and provide detailed explanations of both. In particular, we outline how our algorithmic approach performs compared to state-of-the-art and how our developed theory matches our predictions in practice with extensive experiments. In addition, we have also added separate visualizations for our theorems and assumptions throughout Section 3 and provided a detailed set of supplementary experiments in Appendix E.\n\n**Application.** We agree with the reviewer that the rank-2 order-3 model limits the breadth of applications of the considered model in general. However, this work only presents the rank-2 order-3 model for its accessibility and to show the potential of the considered analysis. For higher ranks/orders, a similar construction can be done (hints on that in Appendix G), which was previously developed for a similar model- Hotelling-type tensor deflation (See Theorem 3.4 in [1])\n\n**Questions.** \n- We thank the reviewer for their great question! We have further benchmarked our proposed algorithm against prevalent spectral tensor decomposition methods that are widely used in practice, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker. We show that the latter collapse in the presence of higher levels of correlation $\\alpha$ and fail to recover the signal of interest. We outline the details of that in Figure 5 and its subsequent explanation in Section 4/Benchmarks. Initially, we have not considered this benchmark highly relevant, as we only considered spectral decomposition algorithms.  \n- Our work, for now, only considers spectral decomposition algorithms given the rich theoretical basis in RMT/RTT. Tensor Train (TT) and Tucker are, however, compression-based decomposition algorithms. \n\nWe invite the reviewer's feedback and suggestions, which we will gladly consider to further improve our paper.\n\n[1]: Seddik, M.

The paper particularly focuses on a scheme named \"deflation\" which calculates leading singular value / vectors one by one and deflates the original tensor, i.e. subtracts the outer product of the calculated top vector times singular value. In a matrix scenario (order = 2) this method is rather straightforward, because singular vectors are orthogonal. In tensors (order >=3) orthogonality is not always satisfied. This makes deflation more challenging. This is the topic the paper addresses. The paper treats the case order=3, rank=2 in details and outlines the schema for higher order and ranks."

However, when considering such assumption, we impose further constraints on the structure of the noise tensor $\\mathcal{W}$. The noise entries $\\mathcal{W}_{i,j,k}$ are not i.i.d anymore and further steps would be needed to estimate the variance given a certain entry. \n- We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. Indeed, at the second deflation step of the $\\gamma$-orthogonalized tensor deflation algorithm (in Appendix F, Algorithm 2), we are jointly optimizing $\\gamma$ and the alignments. Furthermore, we empirically show that the different alignments are concave functions of $\\gamma$ in Appendix E.4 and emphasize that in Section 3.4, which further explains the importance of our approach and provides theoretical guarantees on the quality of our recovery given $\\gamma^*$."

The authors propose a solution for the non-orthogonal case using a parameterized deflation procedure, referred to as \u03b3-orthogonalized tensor deflation. Then an efficient tensor deflation algorithm is introduced, which optimizes the parameter used in the deflation mechanism. In addition, this paper provides a detailed theoretical analysis for the case of rank-2 order-3 tensor model and suggests a general structure for handling the problem for arbitrary rank/order tensors. These findings aim to have a broader impact in machine learning and beyond."

There are many figures in the text, but there are few related explanations. More explanations should be added to make such figures to be more meaningful.\n3. The authors put too much stuff in the supplementary materials, which is not conducive for the readers' reading. For example, the proposed algorithms should be placed in the main text.\n4.

We have substantially revisited our paper and we list the most important changes as a general comment. \n\nTo address the reviewer's specific questions: \n\n1. **Extension to Higher-Rank and Higher-Order Problems.** In addition to the Generalized Deflation Step Procedure in Section 3.1, we now motivate every step in our developed theory/algorithm in detail in the main text. We have considered the extension to higher ranks and/or orders in more detail in Appendix G, where we also list some of the key lemmas to producing our results. In addition, we point the reader to Theorem 3.4 in [1], where the extension follows a similar approach to ours and is done in full and in a high level of detail for the Hotelling-type deflation.\n2.  **Experiments Section.** We focused our experimental evaluation on 2 representative experiments and provide detailed explanations of both. In particular, we outline how our algorithmic approach performs compared to state-of-the-art and how our developed theory matches our predictions in practice with extensive experiments. In addition, we have also added separate visualizations for our theorems and assumptions throughout Section 3 and provided a detailed set of supplementary experiments in Appendix E.\n3. **Outline of the Paper.** We substantially revisited our manuscript, as outlined as part of our general comment. The proposed algorithm is constructed and explained in a high level of detail in Section 3.\n4. **Experimental Setup.** We provided more details of our experimental setup in Section 4 (Experimental Setup). In addition, an easy-to-follow code sample is provided in Appendix E.1 to show exactly how our data is generated. A code repository will also be provided to ensure reproducibility.\n\nWe welcome the reviewer's additional questions and/or suggestions!\n\n[1]: Seddik, M. E.
