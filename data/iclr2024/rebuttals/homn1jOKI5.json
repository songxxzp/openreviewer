Specifically, section 4 contains the \"method\", theoretical analyses, and examples, where section 5 made reference to section 4 but the algorithm is delayed until the appendix. I think it makes more sense to first introduce the method, provide intuitions of why it works, and then give the theoretical analyses with additional remarks.\n   * The Algorithm in Appendix A is not well-written. For example, it is unclear how $\\boldsymbol{S}_t$ in line 5 is used later. The $\\tau^t$ in line 11 is also different from that in lines 7 and 9. Furthermore, it is unclear where the algorithm starts because the line numbers for inputs are intertwined with those for algorithmic steps.\n\n* Experiments:\n    * As explained in the paper, it is expected that standard CP does not work (e.g., in terms of reaching the coverage guarantees). I expect to see additional baselines for this setting that can be compared.\n    * Missing examples on larger graphs. For example, the Flickr and Reddit2 datasets in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14555.pdf. These examples have considerably more nodes than the current settings.\n    * Missing standard deviation of results. From Figure 3 and 4, it seems the standard deviations can be high (I assume each line with light color indicates results from a specific run).\n    * Presentation needs to be improved. For example, the left column of Figure 3 and the Figure 4 have too many lines that affects readability. It is best to just show the average values with error bars. In addition, the authors considered 4 GNN models, but results for some more recent ones are only in the appendix. \n    * Misleading Table 1: it says \"average deviation from guarantee\", but it does not mean a higher deviation necessarily means worse performance. This is because if deviation is positive, this indicates over-coverage, which is still acceptable (one just needs to lower the significance level). In fact, this seems to be the case from looking at Figure 3."

The idea of standard CP is mentioned in section 2, but that section is for general CP and transductive GNNs. I think the details should be discussed in the appendix with a reference in the main text, unless the baseline is taken directly from existing methods. Also, I think the abbreviation \"std. CP\" reads too much like standard deviation of CP, so I suggest changing the name.\n   * Does the method always work well on any GNN models being considered? It is helpful and important to discuss the generality and/or limitation of the method for different GNN baselines\n   * From looking at Figure 3 and 4, it seems standard CP coverages gradually increases as timestep increases. This leads to larger set sizes (as expected). Why is this the case? I think for a meaningful comparison, the empirical coverage should be set the same and then we can compare average set size."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for reading our paper and comments. Here we address the concerns pointed out by the reviewer:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n(1) Our approach was to discuss the related works in context throughout the paper. For completeness, we now added a dedicated section in the appendix (section F) and provide a forward reference in the main paper (end of section 2).\n\n(2) The suggestion to first introduce the method and then give the theoretical analyses is interesting and we agree that it can indeed improve readability. Since this is a major change that would disrupt the discussion with the reviewers (since sections will change) we defer this to after the rebuttal. \nNote, the algorithm which we added to the appendix for completeness is implicitly defined via the equations in section 4 since it essentially has only two steps: (1) computing (a potentially weighted) quantile line 3 or line 5, and (2) creating a set of scores above the quantile line 6. We also now updated it to clarify how $S_t$ is used.\n\n(3) We are not aware of any baselines that are applicable expect standard CP and NAPS. In Appendix C we compared our approach to NAPS. On Figure 6 (left) we show the empirical coverage and we see that our approach matches the nominal value while NAPS consistently under/overcovers. Note, here we outperform NAPS even though the experimental setup favours NAPS since we can only evaluate the coverage on the subset of applicable nodes (nodes that have at least one calibration node in their neighbourhood). On Figure 6 (right) we further show the number of non-applicable nodes for NAPS which grows with time. All nodes are applicable for our approach.\n\nAs mentioned in section 2 and subsection 2.1, the coverage guarantee is probabilistic and can deviate from the specified value $1 - \\alpha$. The concentration around $1 - \\alpha$ (or the standard deviation) is a function of the calibration set size. The distribution (including the variance) is precisely characterized in Theorem 3. A realistic assumption for sparse graph is to have a calibration set not larger than the train set. Hence the small calibration set results in a relatively large variance. As we increase the calibration set size the variance quickly decreases (see figure 17). \n\nWe added results on large graphs Flickr, and Reddit2 to the appendix (section D.5). Interestingly the results on node-exchangeable sampling is close for both standard and subgraph CP. However in the edge-exchangeable sampling the result is different and only weighted subgraph CP can provide a valid coverage guarantee.\n\n(4) As we explained in the paper, the coverage guarantee is bounded by upper- and lower-bounds. The coverage probability either follows a beta distribution, or a collection of hyper-geometric distributions which in both cases a valid CP results in a coverage close to $1 - \\alpha$. An invalid guarantee can result in either over- or mis-coverage. There are two important notes: (i) an over-covering break of the guarantee results in larger set sizes and less singleton hits (see Figure 4) (ii) if the guarantee is invalid, one can not spot whether over- or mis-coverage happens before evaluating the result which makes it inapplicable. That is why in we reported the deviation from the guarantee showing that validity of the guarantee not the empirical coverage."

The author(s) describe how certain exchangeability structure for nodes still persist in these settings, and how conformal prediction techniques can be adapted based on these observations. In particular, the proposed CP methods are valid conditional on subgraphs and when stopping at non-adversarial times, especially in cases when standard CP fails to provide the desired coverage. The methods and theory are clearly supported by empirical experiments. \n\nOverall, I think this paper provides interesting discussion, which both extends the current understanding of CP on graph-structure data and forms a solid foundation for future efforts in this direction. Though the methods only adapt existing ones, the discussion on exchangeability structure is important. The presentation is overall clear, but potential improvements in mathematical rigor and presentation clarity would further strengthen this paper."

This topic is important for deploying GNNs in critical domains. While existing discussion mainly focuses on transductive setting, or only provides approximate and not-actionable guarantees for other settings, this paper stands out by providing solid theory, method, and experiments on node-exchangeable and edge-exchangeable settings. By thoroughly exploring the exchangeability structure in these settings, existing CP methods can be applied to solve seemingly challenging problems in this field. Thus, I think this paper makes a significant contribution to this topic, and will inspire future research efforts of the community.\n\n2. Originality. \n\nThe idea of this paper is original and provides novel insights. \n\n3. Quality. \n\nThis is a thorough paper with solid theory, fruitful discussion, and concrete experiments. \n\n4.

These are all important factors for the validity of CP. While I believe the technical discussion in this paper is correct, sometimes I have to further check the statements in my own mind as some crucial mathematical terminologies are missing. A few possible points that deserve clarification include (1) formal definition of node and edge exchangeability, (2) clearly state the conditions on the score function and how the model is trained, (3) formal definition and examples of the \"evaluation mask\", etc. Please see my questions part. I'd be happy to increase my score if these points can be addressed."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. Mathematical definition of node exchangeability and edge exchangeability.\n\nI suggest adding a formal definition for node and edge exchangeability, just to avoid any confusion. It will also be beneficial to mention some important implications of such exchangeability, e.g., at each time $t$, the existing nodes are exchangeable, so on and so forth. \n\n2. Rigorous terminology in explaining Proposition 1.\n\nCurrently the explanation via $Z=AXW$ after Proposition 1 can be improved by using rigorous terminologies. For instance, in \"For the guarantee to be valid the first two blocks of the result must be row-exchangeable.\", it is unclear what \"the first two blocks of the result\" is, which is harmful for understanding. Also, related to question 1, \"For Mat(1) row-exchangeability already holds from Theorem 2\" can be further clarified by pointing out that nodes in cal and eval are exchangeable due to node exchangeability. I suggest the authors revise this part to improve clarity. \n\n3. How is the evaluation set $\\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ decided? \n\nI am a bit confused how one decides the evaluation set at each time. Is there a pre-defined rule, for instance, do we evaluate all newly arrived nodes immediately at each time $t$, or do we pre-fix the set of indices that will be evaluated at each time $t$? I was asking because if $\\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ is data-dependent, it may need more efforts in justifying the approach/theory. \n\n4. Definition of $Cov(\\mathbb{I}_T)$.\n\nThis is an important quantity in the theorem, and it shall be formally defined. \n\n5. Requirement on score function in Prop 1 and Theorem 3. \n\nIt seems to me that under node exchangeability, one still has exchangeability between calibration and evaluation nodes. However, it is now crucial how the score function $s$ is trained. At least it should be permutation invariant to these nodes? But nothing is mentioned there. I suggest revising this proposition (and its proof, which is a bit handwavy). Similarly for Theorem 3. \n\n6. Is there a technical result for the validity of weighted CP in edge-exchangeable setting? \n\nThe discussion for edge exchangeability (the end of Section 4) is interesting, but incomplete as there is no formal theorem on the validity of weighted CP. I would suggest adding a formal theorem, with clear description on how the edge appears (e.g., it is more clear to state that edges are uniformly sampled from a candidate edge set). \n\n\n-------\nsmall typos & wording questions:\n1. Section 4, line 3: \"callibration node\" should be \"calibration node\"\n\n2. Lemma 1, \"defined on a subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$\"\n\n3. I don't really understand the sentence \"Specifically we can not use the prediction sets of a particular node multiple times to compare and pick a specific one (see \u00a7 D.4 for a discussion).\" in the second paragraph of Section 5."

Here we address the comments and questions:\n\n(1) We added a formal description of node-inductive and edge-inductive sequences and node-exchageability and edge-exchageability in section B of the appendix and modified sections 4.1 and 4.2. All changes are shown with blue color in the updated paper.\n\n(2) Thank you for the valuable suggestions. We changed some parts of section 4.1 which hopefully make the example clearer.\n\n(3) Which node is included at which timestep is a design choice. One can wait until the last timestep and evaluate all the nodes at once, or evaluate each node upon arrival, or $k$ steps after arrival, etc. This corresponds to looking at e.g. columns of the coverage matrix $\\boldsymbol{C}$, or the different diagonals of matrix C. As long as the decision is made prior to observing the prediction sets (independent of the data) the coverage validity holds. \nImportantly, this implies that the guarantee does not hold for adversarially chosen evaluation sets. To illustrate this, we can pick the smallest prediction set for each node across all timesteps. This breaks the guarantee as shown in Figure 13 (Section D.4 in appendix).\n\n(4) Thank you for this suggestion. We now define $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\cdot)$ in section 2.1.\n\n(5) Indeed, we assume that the underlying model and thus the score function is permutation-equivariant. We updated our papers and the theorems to clarify this. We also discuss this assumption in more detail in appendix B.\n\n(6) In light of the reviewer\u2019s comment, we revised section 4.2 and added a formal theorem and a proof (section B in the appendix). In the paper we assume that the nodes from the first $m$ edges from an edge-exchangeable sequence are chosen for the calibration set. Any other exchangable selection that does not depend on the edge order, e.g. uniform sampling, is valid.\n\nWe also thank the reviewer for mentioning the typos. We have resolved them in the modified file."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the time and constructive comments. In following we address the mentioned concerns:\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n(1) Thank you for these valuable suggestions. We added the definition of the graph, and the assumptions on the trained model in section 2.1. We also added formal definitions of node-inductive and edge-inductive sequences, as well as node- and edge-exchangeability. We updated the caption of Fig. 1 to improve clarity and included a forward pointer to the appendix (D.5) where the experiment is explained in full detail.\n\n(2) We agree that the term \"calibration budget\" does not bring additional value so we removed it from the paper. We also agree that the term \"no longer congruent\" is not necessary and have replaced it with \"no longer exchangeable\".\n\n(3) You are right, thank you. We modified Theorem 1 and the text to reflect this.\n\n(4) See the answer to question 3.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n(1) Yes. Both [1] and [2] propose methods to boost conformal prediction on graphs. [1] approaches this problem by a diffusion over the conformity scores, and [2] trains another GNN network from scratch. We theoretically show that any continuous score function while applied with subgraph (and weighted subgraph) CP can adapt to node- or edge-exchangeable inductive graph sequence. Any boosting method on top remains valid if applied in our framework.\n\n(2) Thank you for this suggestion. We modified the beginning of section 2.1, 3, 4.1, and 4.2 and included a more formal definition of node- and edge-exchangeability. All changes are shown with blue color in the updated paper. Additionally we dedicated a discussion in appendix B. \n\n(3) We identified three main limitations. First, as with most other CP methods, the guarantee is marginal. Second, real-world graph may not satisfy node- or edge-exchagability. This can be partially mitigated by the beyond exchangeability framework. Finally, the guarantee does not hold for adversarially chosen evaluation sets $\\mathcal{V}_\\mathrm{eval}$. In other words, the choice of which nodes and at which timesteps are included in the evaluation set must be done prior to observing the prediction set. In the initial submission we only mentioned the first limitation. We now added a discussion of all three (last paragraph of section 6).\n\n(4) We updated the caption of Fig. 1 to improve clarity and included a forward pointer to the appendix (D.5) where the experiment is explained in full detail. \nFigure 9 compares Subgraph CP with Standard CP for different GNN models. CP is model-agnostic, and although the model architecture (as long as it is permutation equivariant) does not affect the validity, it does affect the set size. On the left we show empirical coverage which matches the nominal value for our approach for all models. The MLP baseline does not use the graph structure and is unaffected by the distribution shift. On the right we see that some GNNs return smaller sets on average.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Zargarbashi, Soroush H., Simone Antonelli, and Aleksandar Bojchevski. \"Conformal Prediction Sets for Graph Neural Networks.\" (2023).\n\n[2] Huang, Kexin, et al. \"Uncertainty quantification over graph with conformalized graph neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14535 (2023)."

Although these aspects become clearer upon reading the entire paper, the initial lack of clarity can impede readers from following the logic in their first encounter.\n\n(2) Baselines:\nIn the experimental section, the paper exclusively utilizes standard CP as the baseline. While the authors explain the rationale for not including NAPS as a baseline, it would be beneficial to at least include NAPS results or another inductive-case baseline in the experimental evaluation for a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n(3) Efficiency:\nFor CP methods, it's essential to consider both validity and efficiency. While the experimental results focus on \"coverage,\" which assesses validity, it's equally crucial to assess efficiency. A predictive set that is overly large may not be practically useful. Therefore, it is recommended to include at least one experiment that demonstrates the efficiency of the subgraph CP method."

Here we address questions and concerns:\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n(1) We added the explicit definition of the graph in section 2.1. We also added the assumptions for the trained model (e.g. GNN), and the notation of graph in equation (3) follows the same definition. The graph $\\mathcal{G}_t$ here shows the timestep in which the scores are computed (it refers to the present nodes and edges at timestep $t$). \nFor the definition of simple message passing we added the definition of each matrix. Here $\\boldsymbol{A}$ refers to the adjacency matrix , and $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the feature matrix (defined in section 2.1) and $\\boldsymbol{W}$ refers to the weight matrix  which is defined immediately after.  We thank the reviewer for mentioning that and in case the notation is still not clear we ask the reviewer to kindly point it out.\n\n(2) In Appendix C we compared our approach to NAPS. On Figure 6 (left) we show the empirical coverage and we see that our approach matches the nominal value while NAPS consistently under/overcovers. Note, here we outperform NAPS even though the experimental setup favours NAPS since we can only evaluate the coverage on the subset of applicable nodes (nodes that have at least one calibration node in their neighbourhood). On Figure 6 (right) we further show the number of non-applicable nodes for NAPS which grows with time. All nodes are applicable for our approach.\n\n(3) We draw the reviewer\u2019s attention to Figures 4, 7 (middle, right), 9 (right), 10 (right), 11 (right), 12 (right). We report two metrics regarding efficiency: average set size, and singleton hit ratio which captures what proportion of test nodes are predicted with a singleton set the includes the true label. On all figures and all metrics our approach is superior and has lower average set size and higher singleton hit ratio.\n\n**Question:** The idea of figure 2 is to show which nodes are (mis)-covered at which timestep. We added description of matrix C and Figure 2, in Section B (appendix) with a reference to it in the caption of the figure. We also draw the review\u2019s attention to Figure 7 (in the appendix), where we compare both methods standard CP and subgraph CP. In the same figure we also compare the matrix of set sizes and singleton hits."
