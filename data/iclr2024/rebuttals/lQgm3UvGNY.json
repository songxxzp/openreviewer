On one hand, in this work we not only utilized the closed-source GPT but also employed the open-source Vicuna, hence it is not entirely a black box as we can get access to the model parameters. On the other hand, most present advanced LLMs are trained on large-scale web data, exhibiting a considerable degree of generalization and impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. And some products even use LLMs for search (New Bing/Perplexity AI). Our experimental results also demonstrate that the LLM aids in the iterative information refinement for RM parts, and the overall framework achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance. \n\n\n> **Question 2**: No comparison with sparse approaches\n- In our paper, we focus on zero-shot knowledge retrieval tasks and follow the experimental setup outlined in Gao et al. (2023) by establishing **zero-shot** sparse and dense retrieval baselines, as presented in Tables 1 and 2 for comparison. It is important to note that both ColBERT-v2 and SPLADE-v2 necessitate supervised training, thus requiring heavy query-document annotations. Nevertheless, SPLADE-max [1] achieves 68.4 and 85.1 on nDCG@10 and R@1k respectively on TREC DL 2019, which is worse than our method despite supervised training. Due to the limited time for rebuttal, we can not provide the performance of SPLADE-v2 now since neither the paper reports the performance on Trec DL nor releases their model. Of course, It is also possible to further enhance the performance by leveraging these supervised trained models. Thanks for your great comments!\n\n    - [1] Formal T, Lassance C, Piwowarski B, et al. SPLADE v2: Sparse lexical and expansion model for information retrieval[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2109.10086, 2021.\n\n\n> **Question 3**: How does the performance vary with different LLMs\n- The performance of different models depends on various factors such as training compute, model parameters, etc [2]. As depicted in Table-1, the open-source Vicuna-33B-v1.3 yields better results on DL'19 and DL'20 compared to the Vicuna-13B-v1.5 model (despite Vicuna-13B-v1.5 being from LLaMa-2 whereas Vicuna-33B-v1.3 is from LLaMa-1). This to some extent suggests that as the LM within InteR grows larger, the effectiveness of zero-shot retrieval improves.\n\n    - [2] Jared Kaplan et al., 2020. Scaling laws for neural language models. arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.08361\n\n> **Question 4**: About the overall computational cost\n- Thank you for your constructive suggestions! As the RM part utilizes BM25 which is much faster, the primary bottleneck lies within the LM. For closed-source ChatGPT models, the latency cannot be accurately ascertained due to the API nature. Hence, we additionally included the latency result of open-source models Vicuna-13B-v1.5 on 1 GPU of A100-40GB for each iteration using vLLM [3] in our revised manuscript. Then we observed that it can handle 20.16 requests per minute, which can be further optimized with more advanced LM inference tools.\n\n    - [3] https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n> **Question 5**: More experimental details on hyperparameters\u201d\n- Thank you for your suggestion. We tuned the hyperparameters on validation sets of TREC DL data. We have included these details in our revised manuscript.\n\n> **Question 6**: DeepCT\n- Thank you for your reminder, we have corrected this mistake in our revision."

The iterative expansion will likely sometimes introduce information with negative effects. e.g. irrelevant info, contradictory logics, hallucinated content, lexically similar but semantically irrelevant texts, etc. How often does this happen? How does this hurt performance? Any potential mitigation strategy?"

I am just pointing out the risk here and will let the meta-reviewer decide whether this is an issue or not.\n- On what dataset do you tune the hyperparameters on? If it is the test set, then it largely weakens the reliability of the conclusions.\n- Another area of related work to cite and discuss is query rewriting in conversational QA (e.g. QReCC), where a NLG model is used to refine the query to augment retrieval."

                        "value": "> **Question 1**: Comparison with You.com and Bing.com & The idea is not new\n- Thank you for your valuable comment. To the best of our knowledge, we are not acquainted with the technical details of these two products, as neither product discloses its technical details nor releases technical reports. Combining retrieval models and LLM is a popular direction now, while most existing works only pursue single-step/mono-direction enhancement like \u201cEnhance Retrieval Through LMs\u201d or \u201cEnhance LMs Through Retrieval\u201d. In our work, we are among the earliest to propose iterative information refinement through synergy between retrieval models and LLMs, resulting in more accurate retrieval than state-of-the-art approaches and even outperforming baselines that leverage relevance judgment for supervised learning. We humbly believe that our paper has made a unique contribution and may offer insights for future research in this field.\n\n> **Question 2**: Query formulation is a problem to be addressed\n- Yes, because the query requires being well-crafted, the retrieval performance is not satisfactory. Therefore, we employ LLM for iterative information refinement of RM queries, aiding in better comprehension of the query. Query formulation, specifically designed in our proposed framework, is indeed adopted to improve retrieval results.\n\n> **Question 3**: Extensive reliance on vast training datasets can be time-consuming and may have commercial use limitations\n- Thanks for your valuable comments. Our paper focuses on zero-shot retrieval, hence, we do not rely on any training datasets such as NQ and MS-MARCO. As stated in Section 5.3, \"As for the RM part, we consider BM25 for retrieval since it is much faster.\" The proposed models involved in our primary experiment are all based on BM25 and do not utilize the vast training datasets. Even the Contriever mentioned in Section 5.5 is used for zero-shot retrieval. Section 5.3 includes our training details, and we hope the above clarification can resolve your concerns.\n\n\n> **Question 4**: How scalable is the InteR framework when applied to different types of data.\n- Thank you for your valuable suggestions! Indeed, our approach can be easily adapted to other knowledge-intensive tasks such as QA and fact-checking. We leave these explorations to future work. \n\n\n> **Question 5**: How to optimize our framework for real-time search\n- Thank you for your great question! Our approach sacrificed some efficiency to enhance effectiveness, which is a trade-off. To address real-time search, further optimization can be implemented: Firstly, facilitating real-time search can be achieved by reducing the number of knowledge refinement iterations (M). As shown in Table 3, even with M=1, the retrieval performance remains satisfactory. Since the time required for retrieval grows linearly with M, and the primary bottleneck lies within the LM (whereas the RM utilizing BM25 is much faster than LM), we can further optimize by enabling the LM to decide in a single pass whether to terminate further iterations or generate an answer, thereby concurrently managing both sub-tasks. Lastly, certain products like vLLM[1] have already explored various efficient techniques for leveraging LMs in inference,  and some search engines (like Bing and Google) have tried to incorporate LLMs to improve search quality. All the above efforts can facilitate real-time search. Thanks again for your great question!\n\n    [1] https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm"

The aim of the proposed method is to improve the capability of large language models by incorporating user specific characteristics. To achieve this aim the authors a Bayesian learning method consisted of three main steps. First, they rely on counting processes to draw a finite sample of diverge documents and thus obtain characteristics from the user. In the next stage they use a Bayesian procedure to update their beliefs about the user's preference preference metric and finally they accordingly prioritize their responses to the user's query. After carefully presenting their proposed techniques the authors rely on simulated datasets and show empirical evidence for outperformance of their approach compared to existing methods in the literature."
