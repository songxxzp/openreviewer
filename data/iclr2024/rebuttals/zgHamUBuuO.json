                    "value": "The paper looks into the problem of learning sparse intermediate activations that preserve spatial information, which can help interpret the intermediate outcomes better and be useful for certain tasks. The paper argues that existing methods based on regularization, such as L1 norm on activations, have drawbacks of either low sparsity rate or low accuracy. To overcome this, the paper introduces optimizations such as an extra spatial sparsity layer normalization layer before the activation and iteratively induces a higher sparsity rate during training. The paper evaluates the proposed method on three tasks DIGITCIRCLE, LATEX-OCR, AUDIOMNISTSEQUENCE and shows that it can achieve higher sparsity and higher accuracy than several baselines."

As such, it is less clear how the proposed method can impact state-of-the-art deep neural networks that have been used in practice. It would be more helpful if the authors could add some real applications where sparse activations are useful.\n\nWhile this technique does require changing the architecture, one important thing to note is that it does not impose any stringent requirements on the architecture of h. In fact, in this work, the architecture of h is a fairly sophisticated one, involving both a LSTM and Transformer. The primary restriction is on the properties of g, which is more of a statement about the domain than about the technique. In future work, we will analyze more realistic applications, but we believe that many tasks have properties similar to the OCR and audio processing tasks we used as validation domains to demonstrate the efficacy of our technique.\n\n> Related to the motivation issue, the datasets the paper uses for evaluation seem to be a bit artificial and at a tiny scale.

However, the paper does not explain how these hyperparameters are selected, such as the search space and the sensitivity of each hyperparameter.\n\nWe did not tune these parameters as the first choices we came up with seemed to work relatively well. If needed, we can perform perturbation analysis of these parameters for a camera ready.\n\n> The paper claims that the adaptive sparsity training technique is novel, but it seems to be similar to the iterative pruning method proposed in the lottery ticket hypothesis paper, except that the paper applies it to the activation and via the parameter in the spacial sparsify layer. The paper should better clarify the differences.\n\nWe do not believe there are anything more than superficial similarities between our use of adaptive sparsity and the iterative pruning technique in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis paper. \nWhile both involve the increasing of a quantity related to sparsity over the process of training, the goals, practical effect, and implementation, of these operations are drastically different.\n\nIn the lottery ticket paper, the enforcement of sparsity is done in order to have the neural network continue to parameterize the same function, while having a more efficient computational graph. We, on the other hand, are attempting to change the function computed by our g and h networks to have a different intermediate latent representation.\n\nThe effects are also drastically different. When a neural network has sparse parameters, this is a change to the network, and has the same structure across different inputs and future training steps, Sparse activation, on the other hand, involves modifying the distribution of outputs of a certain layer. Crucially, the pattern of sparsity is not fixed across different inputs, or even across the same input at different points during training. A location that might be activated at one timestep in training might be removed later, even if sparsity does not change. The same can even happen in reverse, with an activation set to 0 in an earlier training iteration set to a value above 0 in a later one.\n\nThese differences in effects lead to differences in the technique. We do not assume that we can predict ahead-of-time how the network will react to changes in sparsity, so we use validation loss as a guide to the adaptive sparsity schedule. Additionally, there is no pruning step per se, we merely update the delta value and allow the exponential moving average to compensate over time.\n\nWe have added a citation to the lottery ticket hypothesis, in Related Work paragraph \u201cSparse activations\u201d, as well as some of this explanation."

When is a given amount of data enough to guarantee that the proposed method can recover all the latent factors? And, are there any other specific requirements needed to have disentangled factor of variations as discussed in [2]?\n\nThis paper is empirical in nature and validates its empirical hypothesis in three different domains. While it would of course be better to have a theoretical result as well, we believe that it is out of the scope of the paper to provide one. A theoretical guarantee would also be inherently limited to the kinds of mathematical objects that could be easily analyzed within a theoretical framework, whereas here we demonstrate that the technique works empirically on a g network that takes the form of a multi-layer residual convolutional network and an h network that is a complex LSTM/transformer architecture.\n\n> Since no theoretical guarantee is provided, it would be good to contextualize more the empirical claim on the motif identifiability which in turn, will justify the use of the proposed method.\n\nIt is not completely clear what is meant by \u201ccontextualizing\u201d in this case. Should we understand this as making more explicit early on in the paper that this is an empirical claim and making clear early on the specific instances where it has been validated? Or is it about providing more guidance to the reader as to what kinds of practical situations the approach might be useful for? If it is the former, we are happy to do so. If the latter, this is new work and we are in the process of investigating potential applications to more realistic problems. As mentioned in https://openreview.net/forum?id=zgHamUBuuO&noteId=tJhJMRIRWh , a variant of Sparling has been used in a biological application.\n\n> Can the authors comment more the sparsity assumption on g^* presented in Section 3.1?\n\nThe sparsity assumption refers to the assumption that the true g^* of the data-generating process satisfies the property of sparsity, that is E_{x ~ D}[NZ(g^*(x))] < delta for some small delta, where we define NZ(m) to be the fraction of elements in the tensor m that are nonzero. This assumption can be thought of as restricting the range of g^* to a subset of its codomain.\n\n> Section 3.3 is hard to parse and does not clearly highlight the connection between the information bound and SPARLING.\n\nWe have rewritten the ending of this section to better highlight the connection.

It is unclear if the method works in more general settings, and this limits how significant it is. Can Sparling be applied in standard image classification tasks to learn sparse but predictive features?\n\nSee https://openreview.net/forum?id=zgHamUBuuO&noteId=tJhJMRIRWh for our response.\n\n> The baselines considered are not totally fair. While the Sparling coefficient t is annealed during the training process to alleviate optimization challenges, the coefficient used for L1 loss is set only once, likely preventing L1 loss from learning sparse representations due to the same optimization challenges. Could we see ablations where the L1 coefficient is also annealed similar to the Sparling coefficient? In particular, is the improved sparsity a result of the spatial sparsity layer, or just the annealing scheme?\n\nAn initial analysis, using an exponentially annealing L1 parameter (specifically, starting at 0.1 and increasing by 33% every time accuracy hits the threshold), shows that this performs slightly less well than our MT technique (about 5% error vs 1.7-3.8% for ours). We will analyze this more completely with different annealing schedules in future, but do not have sufficient time to properly implement this for this particular rebuttal cycle. Even if this were to work, it would not allow us to target specific sparsity values as easily (e.g., if you for one reason or another wanted to consistently keep two parts of your input at different sparsities), and it would require an additional hyperparameter to tune in the form of the initial L1 loss coefficient.\n\n(To clarify, in Sparling, t is not annealed during the training process, rather it is targeted to a quantile of the output of the g network, specified by delta; delta is annealed.)\n\n> Does Sparling work for non-convolutional architectures (e.g. MLP)?\n\nSparling requires some notion of locality for the g layer, but the h layer can be arbitrary. In our case, we used transformers because we were producing sequential outputs, but this is not a necessary feature of the system. In future work, we will explore different h architectures.\n\n> In Figure 6, the retrained h outperforms the end-to-end non sparse network. How is this the case?\n\nWe do not believe that this apparent improvement reflects a genuine advantage to the Retrained technique over end-to-end training. The small difference that can be seen in the diagram is not statistically significant, and we have clarified this in the paper. The numerical difference is also small enough to be explained by minor technical details of convergence criterion in training. In the paper we do not claim Retrained is better than Non-Sparse, merely that it is not worse in two domains, and only slightly worse in the third.\n\n> Why is the performance different at all from the Sparling network which trains the motif model and prediction head end-to-end?\n\nIn the Sparling setting, we are imposing an information bottleneck to force g to have semantically meaningful outputs. The same g is used in the Retrained setting, but since the bottleneck is removed, the network h is able to take advantage of the additional information that would not have been allowed past the bottleneck.\n\nThis becomes relevant because of the presence of noise. As there is noise, there are often motifs that might be real or might be noise, just at the threshold of detection. In a model with no bottleneck, the g model can pass information about these potential motifs through and disambiguate later in the process. However, in the presence of a strong sparsity bottleneck, the model cannot do this without passing through too many nonzero activations. As we describe in the paper, this requires the model \u201ccommit\u201d to choosing one or the other. This results in degraded performance.\n\n> What is the motivation for computing the spatial sparsity layer channelwise?\n\nThere are two alternatives that come to mind.\n\nThe first, using a threshold at each position and channel, would result in a very large number of thresholds and be quite noisy. We make the assumption of homogeneity across positions in the input, as do most techniques dealing with 1d or 2d inputs.\n\nThe second, using a single threshold across all channels, is something we did explore. You can find our analysis in Appendix D. A summary is that this approach leads to substantially higher confusion error on average, while leading to lower false positive error. Confusion error is the error we are most concerned with, so we decided to use per-channel threshold setting."

As such, we did not compare to alternate end-to-end models, as this is orthogonal to the goal of the paper. When we mention Deng is used as inspiration for design choices in this paper, we are primarily referring to the architecture of the g and h network, rather than the core aspects of the technique we are advancing.\n\n> The writing (especially figure captions) can be made more clear.\n\nWe have taken a pass over the paper and clarified/elaborated the captions. If you have any more specific feedback, we would be happy to incorporate it.\n\n> Could you elaborate Fig 2? Do the letters represent specific shapes or the digits themselves?\n\nEach letter represents a separate channel of the post-Sparse layer of our neural network. For example, in the DigitCircle example, the A channel represents the first channel out of 10, the C channel represents the third, the D channel the fourth, etc. In practice, for this network, once trained, you can think of the C channel as representing the 6 digit: however, this is an emergent property of the network rather than something that it was specifically trained to do. This property, where the channels end up recognizing the true intermediate features, is the main claim we are trying to establish with our experiments. I have updated the caption to clarify this."
