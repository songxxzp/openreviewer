For example, the authors state that they are trying to address catastrophic forgetting. The forgetting issue is extensively studied in existing works. The abstract should state what are the limitations that exist in CL literature. Then, this paper should state how their proposed method addresses this specific problem.  Second, the motivation of introducing Online Weight Approximation (OWA) to continual learning is unclear. After reading the paper, it is unclear how OWA addresses the forgetting issue. Third, in the related work section, not only related works should be presented, but also their limitations and relation of the proposed OWA with existing methods should be clearly presented. Lastly, the method description should be clearly connected with continual learning. \n\n\n* Lack of insight into how the proposed OWA mitigates forgetting. It would be better to provide more insights and illustrations of OWA and the connection with catastrophic forgetting. \n\n\n* It is unclear the advantage of the proposed method compared to other related methods. In the introduction and the method sections, the paper should state the advantages of the proposed method compared to others. This would make the positions of the paper more clear.   \n\n\n* The compared baselines are too weak. OWA is only compared to a simple replay method. More recent memory-replay methods should be compared. For example, [1, 2] should be compared.\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\n[1]  Dark Experience for General Continual Learning: a Strong, Simple Baseline.

However, we thought that our\ncontribution could go beyond the tasks tested in the experimental campaign,\nsince the whole continual learning community could benefit from the\nintuitions and results provided in this paper. Also, since our contribution\ndo not build upon any previous method, we thought not to be fair to criticize\nthe approaches of related works or highlight their limitations.\n\nThe advantage of the proposed method consists in the possibility to train a\nsingle model on several tasks while retaining the capability to predict on\nprevious tasks by means of a simple weight adaptation. The memory required\nfor this adaptation is limited, being only N times the number of parameter in\nthe network, where N is the number of coefficients required to approximate\nthe trajectory of the weights across the task.  As we show in the\nexperiments, the proposed approach is particularly efficient in scenarios\nwith many tasks with respect to a simple experience replay method, which\nwould require much more memory to obtain similar results."

References (3), (4) and (5) can transfer knowledge across tasks. Your method by nature cannot perform knowledge transfer. \n\nIn your second set of experiments (section 4.2), you claimed that you are doing class-incremental learning, but since you have no task identification prediction, you are doing TIL. Your evaluation metric is average incremental accuracy, and the results are weak. Please see reference (6) below, which gives the last accuracy after all tasks are trained. The last accuracy should be much lower than average incremental accuracy. A principled way for task identification prediction is also offered in (6). \n\n(6). Kim et al.

The manner in which the coefficients\napproximating the weight trajectory among different tasks are adjusted,\ndistinctly retains a memory of the previous tasks. Conversely, newer tasks\nmodify the weight approximation even at the outset of the task sequence. We\nwould greatly appreciate it if you could provide further clarification on\nthis remark.\n\nRegarding the accuracy, what we are displaying in the plots is actually the\naccuracy on current and previous tasks after training on the current task.\nIt is not the average incremental accuracy which would be, clearly, much\nhigher.\n\nRegarding the data used to train Eq. (7), the update of the coefficient is\nsolely based on the value of the $i$-th weight of the network at a specific\ntraining epoch, as outlined in Algorithm 1. The notation $w_i^k$ denotes the\nvalue of the $i$-th weight of the network at the $k$-th update step in our\nmethod. If we employ an update policy that adjusts the coefficients only once\nper task, then indeed $w_i^k$ represents the value of the $i$-th parameter of\nthe network at the conclusion of the $k$-th task.\n\nThe parameter $N$ represents the number of Legendre polynomials utilized in\nthe approximation, as in Eq. (2). We acknowledge that our definition of this\ncrucial parameter should be clearer, and we addressed it."

The proposed uses $O(n^{2})$ training time for each parameter of the model, which seems quite large, considering the number of parameters present in a typical deep neural network. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to compare the time required to train the proposed method with the other baselines.\n\n2. Empirical evaluation does not include large deep neural networks. For CIFAR10 experiment, authors have used ResNet-10, however, it is not that deep. I suggest the authors to use deeper neural networks, like ResNet-34/50, Vgg-16/19, WideResNet.\n\n3. Additionally, the datasets used for empirical evaluation is not large scale dataset. I suggest the authors to experiment with ImageNet-1k. If it is not possible due to limited resources, then try to evaluate on ImageNet-100.\n\n4. I also think that it is not fair to reduce the number of replay samples of a rehearsal based methods such as Experience Replay, as you are model (parameters) is using very limited memory. This type of comparison is unfair to a rehearsal based methods. In that case, I would suggest the authors to not to use any memory at all and simply compare with regularization based methods such as EWC[1], MAS[2] etc.\n\n5. Finally, this paper does not compare with recent continual learning baselines, EWC[1], MAS[2], GDumb [3], REMIND[4], DER++[5], CLS-ER[6].\n\n[1] Kirkpatrick, James, Razvan Pascanu, Neil Rabinowitz, Joel Veness, Guillaume Desjardins, Andrei A.

More precisely, $N$ represents the number of terms used in the\nexpansion for parameter trajectory approximation. The update of these\ncoefficients between different tasks is accomplished through linear\ncomputations (refer to Eq. 7) involving fixed, known matrices that are shared\namong all network parameters, making the process highly\nefficient. Experimentally, we did not observe a significant computational\nburden, and the experiments exhibited similar running times compared to the\nbaselines.  In response to the reviewer's comments, incorporating a\nquantitative measure of this efficiency will undoubtedly enhance the\narticle's quality.\n\nRegarding the choice on the number of replay samples, we agree that\nincreasing the number of samples would have increased the performance of the\ncompared replay method. However, we think that employing a number of samples\nequivalent to the memory required by our method would be the most fair\nsetting."

Particularly, I wonder the number of Euler steps $S$  in the coefficients $\\tilde{C}_i^S$ was fixed or not. If not, how does it evolve properly, without proportional increasing?\n2. Which replay method did you compare with specifically? Replay methods have had a long history since the emergence of continual learning research, and their performances varied quite a lot. But the performance in your experiment is not so good, which is hard to believe as a state-of-the-art. It would be valuable to discuss how OWA compares to other methods."

We achieve this by introducing a technique to update\nthe coefficients of a specific polynomial expansion for each weight in the\nneural network (NN). Once we determine the order of the approximation,\ndenoted as $N$ (representing the number of coefficients to retain in the\nexpansion presented in Eq. 2), irrespective of the Euler's step performed,\nonly $N$ values need to be stored in memory for each weight of the\nnetwork. The elegance of the method lies in the fact that we simply\n*update* these coefficients rather than adding new ones. The update is\nperformed in a manner that preserves the memory of the information observed.\n\nRegarding the replay strategy, we employed a straightforward experience\nreplay method, determining the size of the buffer as outlined in the paper."
