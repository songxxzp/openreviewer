I am sorry to think that there is no depth to the challenge that this paper is facing.\n\nThe current presented studies in this paper seem like applications of ControlNet in the video domain. if the proposed method is the first work that performs an application for video editing, then it must be published and shared in our societies, but this is not the case.\n\nAuthors may claim the contribution about proposed attention, but to the best of my knowledge, Prompt-to-Prompt proposes a more general form of attention blending, it seems like following that work. To be specific, The h = h_{u} + \\lambda h_{c} seems like one of the attention blending methods, where prompt-to-prompt has already presented these types of blending with a more generalized version. (attention replace, attention refine, attention re-weighting)\n\nUnfortunately, the further proposed long video editing is also not related to the focus of the proposed method. (I mean that is a good issue but not convincing for this paper. I am hoping to meet deeper studies on it as a single paper to tackle that issue.)\n\nWhat readers may want to read in this paper should be examples as given below:\n(1) What was challenging to adding visual condition in video diffusion model and how to solve\n(2) What is the proper condition for applying video editing system.\n(3) The correlation between visual condition and fidelity."

The method outperforms several baselines, providing high fidelity and temporal consistency in alignment with text. Further enhancements allow ControlVideo to align videos with reference images and extend to long video editing, maintaining consistency across hundreds of frames. Experimental results confirm its capability to produce visually realistic, lengthy videos."

Although the authors mention Gen-1, one key emphasis of Gen-1 is utilizing additional controls, which is omitted in the section. Moreover, there are other works targeting similar goals like VideoComposer, which shares a lot of similar functionalities and should be compared with in the experiments. The authors are encouraged to enrich this part in order to objectively formulate their contributions.\n\n2. Concerning temporal attention and key-frame attention, the authors\u2019 contributions are rather limited although many empirical studies have been conducted to finalize the best design choice.\n\n3. From my perspective, long video editing is a significant part of this part. However, in the experimental section, the authors did not provide much visualization and in-depth analysis for this. I suggest putting more emphasis on this part."

The core idea is to start from DDIM noise and then condition the model on additional conditions such as edge maps which should help maintain the \"structure\" of the original video. Additionally, the authors proposed to use the first frame as the \"key-frame\" and condition on that as well to help with longer video editings which need overlapping windows to process.

Building upon previous research is intrinsic to the nature of research, but the \"addition\" should be both clear and significant. Unfortunately, in this paper's case, I find the contributions to be marginal. The concepts of conditioning on previous signals, addressing inconsistencies in conditioning signals, and employing temporal attentions have all been previously explored, and this paper does not provide any substantial updates in these areas. Instead, it largely borrows these ideas from the domain of image generation and applies them to video, which is not a novel approach. For example, Blattmann et al., in \"Align your Latents: High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models,\" employed a very similar approach (i.e. temporal attention) to enhance temporal consistency on top of Stable Diffusion.\n\n- Missing implementation details: The paper lacks essential implementation details, which could hinder its reproducibility and diminish its impact on future research. Important details, such as the size of additional parameters in LoRA, specifics of temporal attentions, fine-tuning procedures, including optimizers and data, are absent. This omission also raises concerns about the reliability of the comparisons in Figure 5, as the models may differ significantly in terms of size.\n\n- Lack of videos: Surprisingly, for a paper focusing on videos, there is a notable absence of video content. I strongly encourage the authors to present their results, along with comparisons to other models, on an anonymous website for the benefit of both reviewers and readers."
