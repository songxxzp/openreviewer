By finetuning LLaMA-7B (SFT/Code variants) on PRM800K dataset for math and the generated code dataset based on MBPP, PRM are trained for specific reasoning problems. The dataset for code is generated via the Mutation Testing process. The method mainly choose the positive-label reasoning node, and if the reward labels of the child nodes predicted by PRM are all the negative ones, the process is backtracked. Such PRMs improve the accuracy of mathematical reasoning of LLaMA2-7/13B and WizardMath-7/13B and HumanEval pass@1 of Code-LLaMA-Python-7/13B compared to Chain-of-Thought prompting."

We plan on extensively revising our manuscript with more extensive benchmarking and will be withdrawing our submission as a result.\nHowever, we'd like to address a few points raised by the reviewer for clarification.\nQuestions:\n- Does this PRM work with more capable models such as LLaMA2-70B, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, etc?\n\nYes, we believe that this approach is viable. However, as mentioned in the results section of our paper, our PRM requires stronger capabilities to effectively match the policy model. This necessitates a balance between the abilities of the PRM and the base model. Additionally, it's not yet clear whether there's a similar scaling law between PRM and the base model. We consider this an intriguing point worth exploring further. Such an investigation could provide valuable insights into optimizing the effectiveness of PRM in various applications.\n\n- Is there any reason why you use different temperatures (0.1 for math, 0.2 for coding)?\n\nFor the configuration of our mathematical sampling, we followed the guidelines outlined in https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09583. For the code aspect, we based our approach on the methods described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374. The results from this paper indicated that the best outcomes for pass@1 were achieved with a temperature setting of 0.2, so we adopted this setting in our experiments. This decision was made to align with the proven effective practices in these prior studies, providing a solid foundation for our own research.\n\n- Is there any reason why you use LLaMA variants for the base LLM of PRM, rather than LLaMA2-7B/WizardMath-7B for math problems?\n\nSince WizardMath-7B was released on August 18th, we were unable to utilize it for training our PRM before our submission deadline. Based on our experience, PRMs trained on stronger mathematical models tend to perform better. This implies that if we had access to WizardMath-7B earlier, it could have potentially enhanced the effectiveness of our PRM. Future experiments incorporating WizardMath-7B for PRM training are expected to yield more promising results.\n\n- In Section 3.4, you seemed to employ Star-Corder, rather than Code-LLaMA-Python. Is there any reason?\n\nSimilarly to the previous question, our initial experiments were conducted on StarCoder until the release of code llama, at which point we found that code llama performed better. We apologize for not having had the time to validate this earlier. This highlights the dynamic nature of research where advancements in models can significantly impact experimental outcomes, and we aim to further investigate and validate these improvements in future work."

The search algorithm is very similar to the philosophy of A*; searching reasoning paths as tree is also not a new thing (Tree of Thought; or even AlphaGo). So IMO, the novelty of the paper is kinda near the threshold, and I personally tend to below the line. While I do accept different opinions on this as most of the LLM papers nowadays looks quite incremental; and this one is better than those --- the question is what the bar is for ICLR.

We plan on extensively revising our manuscript with more extensive benchmarking and will be withdrawing our submission as a result.\nHowever, we'd like to address a few points raised by the reviewer for clarification.\n\n1. In Section 2.1 you mentioned that you trained the base model like Alpaca. If so, when generating each node (step), you still need to generate the whole path to the end of the solution, is that correct? If so, that will introduce many extra cost if some early steps are \"negative\" as the model will continue generation till the end anyway. Please correct me if I understand incorrectly. I didn't see any discussions about this in the paper and this is my largest concern about the efficiency of the search algorithm.\n\nIndeed, the sampling efficiency is a potential downside of our decoding technique, and we also took this issue into account when designing our algorithm, which is why we set a maximum number of search iterations, denoted as \\( T \\). This approach helps in balancing the computational cost and the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n\n2. How did you determine what a step is for math tasks? By \"\\n\"? IIUC, you didn't conduct the style alignment as Lightman in the PRM paper. Without this step, it is not guaranteed that each step would be separated by \"\\n\".\n\nYes, currently our method divides steps based on the '\\n' character, which is a relatively universal approach. However, for models like Wizard Math that are fine-tuned with specific instructions, it's also feasible to divide according to the format of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) instructions. This allows for more tailored processing in line with the specific characteristics of the fine-tuned model.\n\n3. Did you compare your method w/ the sampling and ranking method in the PRM paper? Section 3.4 seems to mention something related but described very unclear. Beating CoT baseline is as expected since you introduced the extra reward model; whether your method can beat other PRM-augmented ranking/search is more important.\n\nYes, we agree with this statement. Due to the limitations of the base model's parameter size, our current PRM results are not as robust as we would like. We plan to conduct additional experiments in the future to further strengthen our findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of PRM under different conditions and with potentially larger model parameters.\n\n4. Did you train your PRM as a classification model? If so, why not train it to produce a continuous value like the PRM paper?\n\nYes, it's a classification model. This is because the dataset from https://github.com/openai/prm800k is annotated with three categories: -1, 0, and 1. This categorization naturally leads to the development of a classification model to handle this type of structured data. However, a continuously valued PRM model is certainly an addition we'll explore in the revised manuscript.\n\n5. In Appendix B.3, the first line of correct and incorrect solution are the same. Why one is positive and the other is neutral?\n\nSorry, this was a mistake in our writing. Thank you for pointing it out.\n\n6. As your method doesn't require to tune the policy model, it is possible to use OpenAI's models as policy models. Did you try it and find it not working since the policy model is much stronger than the reward model?\n\nIndeed, GPT-4's capabilities far exceed those of our PRM model. Our 7B Llama PRM does not have the capacity to comprehend GPT-4, as we mentioned in the results section of our paper, where we discussed the need for the policy model and PRM model capabilities to be aligned. However, from our perspective, PRM is meaningful. It could enhance the inference abilities of some models that are not as powerful as GPT-4, making them more effective in certain scenarios."

We have experimented with training PRM using both a Llama model that has undergone Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and one that has not.

During the training of PRM, we encountered numerous challenges; PRM is quite difficult to train, which may be reflected in the experimental results not being as robust as desired.

Currently, most LLM ability to do multi-step reasoning suffers from cascading errors. To address these issues, the authors propose a greedy heuristic search algorithm that performs step-level feedback using PRM to improve LLM multi-step reasoning."

Combination of PRM, Code, and Mutation testing: To perform experiments with PRM, it usually requires a lot of human annotation. However, the observation that PRM can be trained with mutation testing, which provides automatic code atomic code changes and the fail and pass, was creative."

We plan on extensively revising our manuscript with more extensive benchmarking and will be withdrawing our submission as a result.\nHowever, we'd like to address a few points raised by the reviewer for clarification.\n\n1. How does the proposed approach compare to majority voting and RM-weighted decoding? Given that PRM has not been used in the code domain - showing the performance of these baselines is important.\n\nWe agree that these baselines are very important. Limited by GPU resources and time, we have only conducted comparisons with the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach so far. We plan to include the additional comparisons you mentioned in the future. Moreover, the inference time for majority voting is significantly greater than our method. For instance, as shown in the results at https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20050, the PRM approach compared to majority voting only shows significant effects when the sampling number exceeds 100, indicating a substantial inference cost. In contrast, our method's inference overhead is much lower than majority voting. Given the limited work on the use of PRM in code-related problems, we initially focused on the most direct comparison with CoT. We believe that PRM has tremendous potential in code applications and intend to include the baselines you mentioned later to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.Thank you again for your suggestion and critique, which are instrumental in enhancing the quality of our research.\n\n2. How does the proposed approach compare to outcome-supervised reward models (ORMs)?\n\nOur mathematical data is based on the dataset available at https://github.com/openai/prm800k. Consequently, we could only train the PRM model for validation. Training the ORM directly on this data would result in a significantly higher number of negative samples compared to positive ones, which is a concern we had to consider. Nevertheless, we intend to \n\n3. Why is self-assessment more expensive than PRM, given that both the PRM and generator use the same LLM?\n\nThis aspect was addressed in our paper. We noted that the complexity of inference for a decoding-only transformer is \\( O(N^2) \\), where \\( N \\) represents the sequence length. As the sequence grows, the cost of inference rapidly increases. Therefore, self-assessing the entire sequence is highly resource-intensive. In contrast, PRM fundamentally operates as a classification model and requires only a single forward pass, making it significantly more efficient in this context."
