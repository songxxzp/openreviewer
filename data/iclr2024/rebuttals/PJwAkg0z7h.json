I'm wondering if this is clarified in the text, or if the authors can clarify.\n\n3) In Section 4's \"Data Preprocess\" section, the authors write \"to feed the sequences of varying length into the model, we pad all sequences to the same length, then use the \"sequence_mask\" tensor to identify which even tokens are padding.\" These masks are not defined, and are referenced no where else in the manuscript, so in my opinion this passage carries almost no information. To my understanding (which may be incorrect), some TPP datasets consist of a single sequence, and some models may process the sequence recurrently, i.e. each state embedding h_t depends only on the previous embedding h_{t-1}. For these models, why are variable-length sequences needed? On the other hand, datasets with events of multiple types (and models that can handle multi-type events) will need variable-length sequences. It would be very useful to the reader if the authors could describe these multiple scenarios, and specifically how EasyTPP handles each one at the implementation level.\n\nIf given satisfactory answers to the above, I am willing to raise my score."

Therefore in my opinion all plots showing empirical results should be replaced with tables. Is this possible in the camera-ready version?\n\nWe agree that empirical results should be better illustrated with numbers instead of figures. We have replaced the figure of the main prediction result with a table in the main context and all the other tables are in Appendix D.3. We are committed to replace all the figures with tables in nice formats in the camera-ready version. See [Presentation Improvements].\n\n> I may have missed this in my reading, but in Fig 1, I don't quite know what is meant by \"Temporal event sequence\" as opposed to \"temporal point process\". Furthermore, isn't a Hawkes process a version of a temporal point process? It seems that these publication sets may overlap somewhat. I'm wondering if this is clarified in the text, or if the authors can clarify.\n\n\nIn fact we have clarified this search process in Appendix E.1. In the revised version, we have added one line to refer to this section for details of how we count the articles.  See [Presentation Improvements].\n\nWe clarify again here. To find out the number of point process research papers, we search in arxiv with the three terms (Temporal point process, Hawkes process,  Temporal event sequence) that are widely used in related publications, respectively. To avoid the overlap of searched results, we search with the following advanced rule:\n- Temporal point process: it corresponds to the articles whose abstracts contain the term \u2018temporal point process\u2019. \n- Hawkes process: it corresponds to the articles whose abstracts contain \u2018hawkes process\u2019 but not the term \u2018temporal point process\u2019. \n- Temporal event sequence: it corresponds to the articles whose abstracts contain the term \u2018temporal event sequence\u2019 without neither the term \u2018hawkes process\u2019 nor \u2018temporal point process\u2019.\n\n\n\n> In Section 4's \"Data Preprocess\" section... To my understanding (which may be incorrect), some TPP datasets consist of a single sequence, and some models may process the sequence recurrently, i.e. each state embedding h_t depends only on the previous embedding h_{t-1}. For these models, why are variable-length sequences needed? On the other hand, datasets with events of multiple types (and models that can handle multi-type events) will need variable-length sequences. It would be very useful to the reader if the authors could describe these multiple scenarios, and specifically how EasyTPP handles each one at the implementation level.\n\nFirstly, the dataset each contains thousands or tens of thousands of sequences, where each sequence usually corresponds to the sequence of one user\u2019s behavior (e.g., one user\u2019s reviewing behavior on Amazon). As a result, the variable-length sequence exists (not \u2018needed\u2019) in every dataset. See Appendix C for dataset descriptions and Table 2 for statistics of the dataset. \n\nSecondly, because the input is fed batch-wise into the model and there may exist sequences of events that have unequal-length in the same batch, we pad them to the same length batch-wise. This padding mechanism is the same as that in NLP when we pad text sentences.\n- Users can choose to decide whether padding to the beginning or end, padding to max length of batch or a fixed length across the dataset. The function interface and usage are almost the same as those in huggingface/transformers package.\n- The sequence_mask is used to denote whether the event is a padded one or a real one, which will be used in computation of log-likelihood and type/rmse evaluation as well.\nAn detailed explanation of dataset preprocessing operation can be found at our documentation https://github.com/Anonymous0006/EasyTPP/blob/main/docs/source/user_guide/dataset.rst#expected-dataset-format-and-data-processing\n\nLastly, to clarify, the input sequence format is the same no matter how many event types the data have, e.g., a sequence is $[(t_1, k_1), (t_2, k_2), (t_3, k_3),...]$, where $k_i$ is a non-negative integer denoting the event type. For all the models, we use an embedding layer (nn.Embedding in torch) to map the event type $k_i$ of each event to a dense vector in higher space; then pass it to the following modules to construct the state embedding $h_i$ recurrently (with $h_{t-1}$). We do not differentiate whether it is a single event type sequence or multi-type events because the codebase can handle both.\n\nThe corresponding code of event type embedding can be found at https://github.com/Anonymous0006/EasyTPP/blob/main/easy_tpp/model/torch_model/torch_basemodel.py#L25.\n\nIn sum, we have rephrased the paragraph and added Appendix C.1 for a more detailed explanation in the revised paper.

I don't think a software-level abstraction is a good fit for ICLR.\n\nPlease see [Technical Contribution and Broader Impact]\n\n> The description of the system design and interface lacks details.\n\n\nIn section 3, we discuss the modules in detail and use figure-3 to illustrate the pipeline of the system.\n\nIn section 4, we discuss the interface with two examples of usage (how to customize a model and how to run the pipeline)  in Listing 2 and Listing 3.\n\nIn Appendix A, from page 13 - 16, we discuss the details of design and interface such as \n- High level software architecture (section A.1): figure-8 depicts the detailed architecture with each module\u2019s functionality annotated / explained in text.\n- Why and how the system supports both Tensorflow and PyTorch optimization framework (section A.2 - A.3).\n- Pseudo implementation to customize a model using the interface of the code base (section A.4)\n- Pseudo implementation to run an existed model using the interface of the code base (section A.5)\n\nBesides, an even more detailed description of system and interface could be found at the document provided in our code base: https://github.com/Anonymous0006/EasyTPP/tree/main/docs/source/ref. Please see Readme.md to find out how to generate htmls for better visualization. The explanations of the interfaces at any level are well documented and easy to search and read.\n\nIn all, around \u00bc of the paper contents, plus pages of online documents,  relate to the system design and interface, could you please elaborate which part is still unclear to you\uff1f\n\n> It's unclear what points the authors intend to demonstrate in the experiment section.\n\nWe want to demonstrate the following key insights from the experiment:\n- Insight 1: The performance of the classical model MHP is worse than the neural models across most of the evaluation tasks.\n- Insight 2: There is no single winner against all the other methods on time and type prediction. Notably, all the best to-date models make poor predictions on time of future events. Moreover, on type prediction, attention-based models only outperform other architectures by a small margin. \n\nThese insights have strong implications on our benchmarking work and future research:\n- Based on insight 1, we decide that our code base focuses on neural TPPs rather than classical TPPs. \n- Insight 2 signals that we should think beyond architectural design for future directions. For the past decade, this area has been focusing on developing new architectures, but the performance of new models on the standard datasets seem to be saturating. Looking into the future, we advocate for a few new research directions that may bring significant contributions to the field, summarized in Section 6 [FUTURE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES], including building foundation models of event sequence, empowering the model with large language models etc. \n\nPlease let me know if these points are clear for you."

The EasyTPP package implements many recent TPP models and can be used with either PyTorch or TensorFlow. The authors utilize the package to benchmark these TPP models across a variety of data sets and prediction tasks.\n\n*After author rebuttal:* I have read through the other reviews and author rebuttal and still strongly support the paper.

                        "value": "> The authors compare against the classical Multivariate Hawkes Process (MHP) but don't specify what type of kernel they use (I assume exponential) or structure of the excitation matrix.\n\nWe are indeed using the exponential kernel for MHP whose dimension equals the number of the event types of the dataset. \n\nWe have added the specification for MHP in the revised version.  See [Presentation Improvements].\n\n\n> Some typos, e.g. Multivariate Hakwes Process (MHP)\n\nThanks for pointing this out. We have fixed this typo in the revised version.  See [Presentation Improvements].\n\n> Is there an easy way to incorporate marks into your package? From the description in the paper, it seems like you can easily handle different event types through a multivariate TPP, but I don't see any discussion of marks. In many application settings, we can have a feature vector for each event, which can be modeled as a mark.\n\n\nYes. It is easy to incorporate it in our package. We can modify the input data structure to include a feature vector for each event, and in the input module, we apply a feature encoder to produce a feature embedding and concat it with the event type embedding. This modification needs only a small amount of work and is compatible with the current framework.\n\nWe are committed to adding this functionality in the future version. See [Commitment]."

                        "value": "It seems like the main concern from other reviewers is regarding the lack of technical innovation. Considering that the paper is submitted to the primary area of datasets and benchmarks, I disagree with this concern. The amount of technical innovation is roughly what I would expect for a datasets and benchmarks paper.\n\nFurthermore, I would argue strongly for the potential significance and impact of this contribution to the growing machine learning community working on TPPs. As a researcher in this community myself, I am much more likely to make use of the contributions from this paper than, say a paper proposing a new neural network architecture for TPPs (which perhaps the other reviewers would rate more highly on technical innovation). There is a tremendous need for high quality software packages for neural TPPs, and the authors are providing just that."
