                    "value": "1. Overall, I find the intuition to utilize effective rank to enhance forward compatibility is not well illustrated. There are many core factors that are not well discussed in the main paper, e.g., the relationship between feature richness and effective rank, the relationship between feature richness and forward compatibility, and the relationship between feature richness/effective rank and catastrophic forgetting. Hence, reading the paper sometimes makes me confused about why the heuristic loss works for the specific capability.\n2. As repeated many times in the main paper, the authors argue that CwD [1] and FACT [2] require \u201cclass information\u201d to enhance forward compatibility. What does the \u201cclass information\u201d mean in this paper, since the concept is abstract and hard to figure out? In my opinion, CwD and FACT can work during the first incremental stage and use only the base classes (first-stage classes) to enhance forward compatibility. They do not require extra information like future classes to design the loss term, which is almost the same as the authors do in Eq. 5. Hence, it requires careful clarification about this claim point.\n3. As another noteworthy weakness, I must highlight that the current experimental evaluation is somehow weak, lacking the comparison on ImageNet1K (dataset) to other state-of-the-art works like DER, FOSTER [3-4] (methods), other related competitors like FACT, BEEF [5] (methods), and the experimental results without half base classes (settings). See more comments in the following questions."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "Apart from the above weaknesses, there are several other questions that need to be addressed in the rebuttal.\n1. As a benchmark dataset for large-scale class-incremental learning, reporting the results on ImageNet1000 is essential for a holistic overview.\n2. The baseline methods adopted in Table 1 are somehow outdated (among them, the latest is from 2019). I suggest the authors consider more recent state-of-the-art methods like DER and FOSTER [3-4] and see whether the proposed method performs well on these algorithms. Also, it would be better to show if the proposed method can work on other backbones like ViT (e.g., DyTox).\n3. There are several works addressing forward compatibility in the class-incremental learning field, e.g., CwD, FACT, and BEEF [1,2,5]. However, only CwD is adopted in the comparison in Table 3. Since this paper is targeted for forward compatibility, it is essential to conduct a holistic evaluation considering all these competitors fairly.\n4. Apart from training from half classes, there is another setting in class-incremental learning that equally divides all the classes into incremental stages. Under this setting, the authors cannot utilize the rich class information for regularization. It is essential to provide corresponding experimental results to show whether the proposed method can tackle various class-incremental learning settings.\n\n\nIn summary, this paper tackles an important problem in the class-incremental learning field, which is a desired capability in future research. However, my concerns focus on the not well-illustrated intuition, exaggerated contribution, and half-baked experiments. \n\n[1] Mimicking the Oracle: An Initial Phase Decorrelation Approach for Class Incremental Learning.

                    "value": "The paper introduces a novel method for promoting compatible representations in the context of class incremental learning. The authors have designed a regularization term, known as RFC loss, which is based on a continuous approximation of matrix ranks referred to as the **Effective Rank**. The central claim is that maximizing the effective rank of the matrix containing feature representations enhances the feature richness. In particular, applying this regularization only to the base task within a class incremental learning process positively impacts the acquisition of new tasks, leading to improved overall performance and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Their method falls under the category of forward-compatible approaches, but as demonstrated in the experimental section, the RFC loss can significantly enhance the performance of many common backward-compatible methods that represent the current state-of-the-art solutions for the class incremental learning problem."

It provides a clear context for the reader, which is crucial for understanding the proposed approach.\n2. The RFC loss introduced in the paper is an elegant solution for enriching feature representation during the base task and the author provides a solid theoretical rationale to support their claims. \n3. The paper provides a robust empirical foundation by conducting analyses against a baseline method. This empirical evidence demonstrates the success of the feature representation achieved through the RFC loss in improving performance across different task sequences in a class incremental learning scenario. \n4. The experiments carried out in the paper consistently show that the RFC loss has a positive synergy with various state-of-the-art methods. This synergy leads to improved accuracy across different task sequences and datasets."

                    "value": "1. The RFC loss is only used during the training of the base task and does not exhibit significant improvements when applied also to novel tasks. While the authors acknowledge that using this regularization intensifies model modifications from the previous session, a more detailed analysis of this limitation is essential since it represent a crucial problem in class incremental learning.\n\n2. Many state-of-the-art methods cited in the paper that benefit from the RFC loss are backward-compatible exemplar-based approaches. However, in recent times, exemplar-free methods have emerged as strong competitors. They rely on prototypes instead of examplars and often employ Class Augmentation techniques during the base task to enhance the initial feature representation. For example, [1] employs a mixup approach to achieve a similar effect to the proposed RFC loss.  In fact, in that paper, the authors show that their method can increase the number of directions with significant eigenvalues in the feature space. Other works, such as [2], follow similar reasoning by using self-rotation as class augmentation technique. In my opinion, a comparison with these exemplar-free methods could be valuable to understand whether RFC could be used in substitution or synergy with these Class Augmentation techniques.\n\n3. The paper could benefit from the inclusion of a dedicated section addressing the limitations of the proposed approach. This section would provide transparency and a more thorough assessment of potential shortcomings, allowing readers to understand the practical constraints and challenges associated with the RFC loss method.\n\n[1]: Class-Incremental Learning via Dual Augmentation, NIPS 2021\n\n[2]: Prototype augmentation and self-supervision for incremental learning, CVPR 2021"

                "questions": {
                    "value": "My concerns are summarized in the Weaknesses section. Here, I add two more technical questions:\n\n1. At the beginning of Section 3.1, your method selects $N$ samples from a mini-batch, and it also required that $N > d$, where $d$ represents the dimensions of the feature space, which is 512 when ResNet18 is used as the backbone. I assume that this requirement depends on the relationship $\\text{erank}(H) < \\text{rank}(H) \\le \\min(N, d)$. However, in your provided code (```ucir_w_rfc.py```), I noticed that a batch size of 128 is employed, which seems to contradict this derivation. Could you please clarify this point? In a more general sense, does the batch size play a significant role in your approach? If so, have you conducted an ablation study on this hyperparameter? While the necessity of a large batch size may not be a primary concern, it might be worth mentioning as a potential limitation of the method if the regularization doesn't show a significant effect with smaller batch sizes.\n\n2. Figure 2a show the differences between various rank definitions in a standard supervised learning scenario. It would be interesting to see a similar plot (or analysis) for the class-incremental scenario, both with and without the RFC regularizer. For example, at the end of the base task, depending on the presence of the regularizer, how does the effective rank compare to the theoretical rank? In my opinion, it would also be interesting to observe how the effective rank behaves when the mentioned Class Augmentation techniques are applied in comparison to when the RFC loss is applied.\n\nFor now I set my score at 5, but I'm sincerely interest in the further development of this discussion."

Similarly, LwF, MAS, SI, Rwalk are early-stage regularization methods, and stronger non-exemplar based methods are suggested to be included.\n* Experiments. How the proposed method performs on large scale dataset ImageNet Full?\n* Novelty. The proposed method is the same as vne proposed in (Kim et al., 2023), which may lack of novelty. In additional, the idea of increasing rank for incremental learning has been explored in the paper of CwD  (Shi et al., 2022)."
