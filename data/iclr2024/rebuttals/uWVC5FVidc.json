Improved accountability: Unbiased watermarks can help track and attribute model outputs to specific providers, which can improve accountability and transparency in the use of LLMs. This can be particularly important in applications such as automated content generation, where it may be difficult to determine the source of generated content.\n\n2. Maintaining output quality: Previous studies have suggested that watermarking can compromise the quality of model-generated outputs. However, the use of unbiased watermarks can maintain output quality while still providing a means of tracking and attribution.\n\n3. Protection against misuse: The use of unbiased watermarks can help protect against the potential misuse of LLMs, such as the generation of fake news or other malicious content. This can help ensure that LLMs are used responsibly and ethically.\n\n4. Flexibility: The authors offer a comprehensive framework for designing and detecting unbiased watermarks, which can provide flexibility in the implementation of watermarking for different applications and use cases.

We appreciate your thoughtful comment and would like to answer the questions point by point.\n\n> How do you envision the implementation of unbiased watermarks in practice, and what challenges do you anticipate?\n\nRegarding the practical implementation of unbiased watermarks, storage issue could be a consideration. In our algorithm, we introduced the concept of context code history, which inevitably requires additional storage space. While theoretically, unlimited storage could enable $\\infty$-shot-undetectable watermarking, practical constraints might limit storage capacity, resulting in n-shot-undetectability. As n increases, so does the required storage space, but this trade-off improves undetectability. For instance, storing the context code of the last n outputs guarantees n-shot-undetectability. Generally, storage complexity grows in $O(n)$. More details can be found in Appendix G.3, item three.\n\n> How do you plan to address concerns (in practice) regarding the potential manipulation or removal of watermarks by users?\n\nWe believe the battle between watermarking and watermark removal will be a long-living problem. This dynamic has seen rapid developments recently. Our current research marks significant progress in this area by theoretically ensuring that users cannot detect the presence of watermarks. This advancement complicates the manipulation and removal of watermarks, as it becomes challenging to assess whether the watermark remains intact. We look forward to future research that will build upon these advancements.\n\n> Can you elaborate the key factors when chasing the optimal trade-off between mentioned in the paper?\n\nOne of our core contributions is the decoupling of unbiasedness and watermark strength. Previous works faced a trade-off between output quality and watermark detectability; to make watermarks easier to detect, one had to sacrifice quality. Our approach ensures that output quality remains unchanged, regardless of watermark strength. Thus, we believe we have achieved an optimal trade-off between these factors.\n\nAgain, thank you for your insightful questions and the opportunity to clarify our approach."

Specifically, although the watermarks can still be detected after changes to the input, the efficiency of this detection drops notably, necessitating longer sequences for reliable watermark detection. This vulnerability is fundamentally due to the fact that watermark detection relies on the presence of identical n-grams during watermark generation and detection. Any form of attack, including paraphrasing or simple word substitutions, could easily disrupt these n-grams, thereby reducing the efficiency of watermarks detection. This vulnerability is not unique to our work; it is a common challenge in the field of watermarking, similar to recent findings (Kirchenbauer et al. 2023).\n\nThe primary contribution of our paper is the development of the concept of an unbiased watermark. While we recognize the importance of robustness in watermarking research, our current work is not aimed at enhancing the robustness of watermarks. Our approach maintains a level of robustness on par with existing methodologies, as discussed in Appendix F.5.\n\n> Larger models like LLAMA-2 should also be evaluated to further enhance the practicality.\n\nWe have conducted evaluations with larger models, including LLAMA-2 in our appendix. The results of these evaluations are detailed in Appendix F.1, where we used LLAMA-2 for text summarization and poetry generation tasks. Furthermore, we have expanded our experiments to include natural language generation with Wikitext and instruction following with FLAN, providing additional practical evidence for downstream invariant property:\n\n| Model                       | Wikitext (Llama 2), PPL | Flan (Llama 2), PPL |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| $\\delta$-reweight           | 1.692\u00b10.009                       | 2.57\u00b10.03           |\n| $\\gamma$-reweight           | 1.719\u00b10.011                       | 2.557\u00b10.028         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=0.0)          | 1.693\u00b10.011                       | 2.558\u00b10.025         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=1.0)          | 1.761\u00b10.011                       | 2.697\u00b10.028         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=2.0)          | 2.025\u00b10.017                       | 3.17\u00b10.04           |\n\nThank you again for your thoughtful comment.

I am concerned about whether this comparison is fair enough.\n\nWe didn't finetune the model, and we use the same model OPT-6.7B across NW, $\\delta$-RW, $\\gamma$-RW to ensure a fair comparison.\n\nThe lower readability output in the 'NW' section is due to the inherent variability of the OPT-6.7B model's performance. This model sometimes generates lower-quality outputs, which is evident in the NW case. This is a characteristic of the OPT-6.7B model itself, rather than an effect of our watermarking strategy or a lack of fine-tuning.\n\nIn light of your feedback, we have replicated table 3 with a state-of-the-art model, LLaMA2. We find that the readability of the outputs improve significantly, and the variability of output quality also decreases.

                        "value": "We appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to reviewing our manuscript. We are grateful for the opportunity to address the concerns and queries you have brought forward.\n\n> While the gamma scheme overlap with the schemes presented in Kuditipudi et al. (... there are strong similarities in the way the signature is encoded however)\n\nWe respectfully disagree with the assertion of strong similarities in signature encoding between our gamma reweight scheme and method in Kuditipudi et al.\n\nThe critical distinction lies in the underlying mechanism: all schemes $\\Gamma(\\xi,\\mu)$ presented in Kuditipudi et al. are based on inverse sampling, where the output is a specific value. In contrast, our gamma reweight scheme is not based on inverse sampling, as it produces a distribution rather than a single value\u3002\n\nGiven this fundamental difference, we do not concur with the notion of strong similarity. We would appreciate it if the reviewer could clarify what specific similarities are being referred to. This clarification will enable us to address the concern more directly and ensure that our method's uniqueness and contributions are accurately understood.\n\n> but it would be much more interesting to give our some sort of a global metric, such as the AUC (or AUC-PR) in detecting watermarked vs unwatermarked text\n\nActually, we have reported AUC performance in Section F.5. In standard experiments, where no perturbations are introduced, the AUC is extremely close to 1, and the deviation from 1 is so minimal that it falls within the margin of error, making quantitative assessment challenging. This is the primary reason why we have opted to present the score per token in the main paper, as it provides a more discernible measure of the watermark's detectability.\n\n>  it is not clear how robust the maximin LLR scheme is to different scenarios. Meaningful ablation experiments are missing.\n\nWe kindly direct your attention to Section F.2 in the appendix, where we provided ablation experiments specifically to explore the robustness of the maximin LLR approach in different scenarios. These experiments cover variations in temperature settings, top-k selections, different prompts, and different language models.\n\nWe believe that these experiments meaningfully address concerns regarding the robustness of our approach.\n\n> you will exhaust all the possible n-grams\n\nWhile that is possible in theory, the number of all possible n-grams is astronomically large for $n\\geq 3$, and in reality, it's nearly impossible to reaching saturation. \n\nFurthermore, refraining watermarking on previously seen n-grams is necessary for ensuring strict unbiased property. As such, we consider being the first to clearly explain this critical point as a significant contribution of our work, rather than a weakness.\n\nAdditionally, if needed, there are straightforward modifications that can slightly relax the strict $\\infty$-shot-undetectable property to circumvent any practical limitations, as discussed in Section G.2, third point, of the appendix.\n\n> How does the watermarking scheme perform on context completion and instruction following tasks?\n\nWe've broadened our datasets to include wikitext for context completion and flan for instruction following. The downstream-invariant property is also observed in these new tasks.\n\n| Model                       | Wikitext (Llama 2), PPL | Flan (Llama 2), PPL |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|\n| $\\delta$-reweight           | 1.692\u00b10.009                       | 2.57\u00b10.03           |\n| $\\gamma$-reweight           | 1.719\u00b10.011                       | 2.557\u00b10.028         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=0.0)          | 1.693\u00b10.011                       | 2.558\u00b10.025         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=1.0)          | 1.761\u00b10.011                       | 2.697\u00b10.028         |\n| Soft($\\delta$=2.0)          | 2.025\u00b10.017                       | 3.17\u00b10.04           |\n\nWe want to emphasize that our methods are supported by rigorous theoretical guarantee, and the downstream-invariant property is independent of specific task.\n\n> Is it possible to present some empirical evidence on how many tokens are needed to achieve a certain level of detectability on open source LLMs?\n\nYes. This can be computed by the score per token. For instance, if each token increases the score on average by 0.8784 (as reported in Table 2), then 12 tokens would be enough to achieve a score of 10.5, which means watermark can be detected with p-value < 0.0005, while 23 tokens would bring it down to p-value < 3e-8."

I intend to call out the 'gamma' scheme, which the paper itself mentions is based on inverse transform sampling, as are all of the schemes in the Kuditipudi paper. Can the authors clarify why they think the inverse transform sampling based schemes in Kuditipudi et al. paper are very different?\n\n2. Reg AUC as a metric: This goes back to my comment to evaluate with 'instruction-tuned models' with instructions. If I understood the theory correctly, the theory only guarantees that the quality is unaffected but says nothing about the watermarking strength. For the instruction-tuned models, the AUCs are generally not in the ballpark of 1.0. See the Kuditipudi et al. paper for the instruction model experiments, and notice the degradation in the watermark detection performance on moving from Llama to an instruction tuned model. I find the authors claim here in the rebuttal for not running evaluations with instructions on an instruction tuned model confusing -- I would be extremely surprised if the AUC was nearing 1.0 for an Alpaca/Vicuna run at reasonable temperatures.\n\n3. For the experiments in Section F2, what was the parameter d? Can you also look at the robustness of likelihood agnostic methods? \n\n4. \" it's nearly impossible to reaching saturation\" -- that is besides the actual point. 1. You'll probably never encounter all possible trigrams. E.g., \"me apple blue\" is probably never going to occur. 2. And some trigrams are quite common, e.g., \"This is how\". For these common trigrams, you'll stop watermarking after the first time you see it, and you'll gradually weaken the watermark. From my experiment and ballpark numbers, only 70-80% of the trigrams in a 500 word piece of text are unique, and this number drops quite sharply. So, even for that 500 word piece of text, you're not watermarking 20-30% of the tokens... and if you think about 10000 tokens, you'll most definitely not be watermarking more than half the tokens with n=3. Am I missing something here?\n\n5. \"The downstream-invariant property is also observed in these new tasks.\" -- as I said above, my comment had nothing to do with the model quality being affected. It was more to do with the watermarking strength being affected. If your prompt is, \"Generate the first 100 primes\", do you expect it to be watermarkable? It is known that RL reduces entropy -- do you expect RLHFed model to have the same entropy? Does your theory have any guarantees wrt watermarking strength?"

                        "value": "Thank you for your continued engagement and for providing detailed feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to address your points.\n\n> I intend to call out the 'gamma' scheme, which the paper itself mentions is based on inverse transform sampling\n\nIs that another typo? Are you referring to the 'delta' scheme?\n\n> Can the authors clarify why they think the inverse transform sampling based schemes in Kuditipudi et al. paper are very different?\n\nIn our previous response, we clarified the distinguishing factors between our gamma reweight and inverse sampling. Here, we'll highlight the differences between our delta reweight and Kuditipudi et al.'s inverse transform sampling schemes. Although delta reweight, as a specific case of our framework, employs inverse transform sampling, it diverges significantly in other aspects, such as avoiding watermarking for existing context and deriving score based on LLR and maximin LLR. Additionally, our framework is more general than Kuditipudi et al., as our framework encompasses methods beyond inverse transform sampling, such as the gamma reweight.\n\n> If I understood the theory correctly, the theory only guarantees that the quality is unaffected but says nothing about the watermarking strength.\n\nRegarding our general unbiased watermark framework, you are correct that the framework itself only guarantees that the quality is unaffected but does not specify a lower bound for watermark strength. To clarify, the general framework encompasses a broad range of possibilities, including scenarios where no watermarking is applied at all (with identity map as unbiased reweighting function), the lower bound for watermark strength in this general context is indeed zero.\n\nHowever, for specific reweights within our framework, there are non-trivial lower bounds on watermark strength. For instance, for delta reweight , the average LLR score for a token with a watermark is its entropy, $H(P)$, by definition. For our likelihood-agnostic methods, the average score is related to the R\u00e9nyi entropy of order 2, expressed as $\\ln2 - \\exp(-H_2(P))$. Further details are provided in Appendix D.1.2 of our paper.\n\n> I find the authors claim here in the rebuttal for not running evaluations with instructions on an instruction tuned model confusing -- I would be extremely surprised if the AUC was nearing 1.0 for an Alpaca/Vicuna run at reasonable temperatures.\n\nPer your request, we conducted experiments to provide score per token values for instruction-tuned models:\n\n|Method|Flan (Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)|\n|---|---|\n|$\\delta$-reweight|0.2435\u00b10.8345|\n|$\\gamma$-reweight|0.0929\u00b10.2841|\n\nThese numbers remain substantial, indicating strong watermark detectability.\n\nMoreover, It's crucial to consider the impact of text length on watermark detection. For example, if Llama 2 assists in writing an email with around 100 tokens, the total score would be high, making it easy to distinguish watermarked from unwatermarked text. However, for a short text like a subject line with only about 5 tokens, the discrimination power would be much weaker. Thus, it is essential to carefully consider the context and length of the text when comparing watermark detection capabilities.\n\n> For the experiments in Section F2, what was the parameter d?\n\nThe parameter $d$ was chosen from the set $\\\\{0,0.1,\\dots,0.9,1.0\\\\}$, as detailed in Appendix E, \"Watermark detection\" section of our paper.\n\n> Can you also look at the robustness of likelihood agnostic methods?\n\nIt's important to note that likelihood agnostic methods are independent of the likelihood, so they are invariant to all the perturbations considered in Section F.2. Therefore, their robustness only depends on how much the attacks disrupt the original n-grams in the text.\n\n> you'll stop watermarking after the first time you see it. you'll gradually weaken the watermark ... Am I missing something here?\n\nWe think what's missing from your comment is the Pareto optimality of our approach regarding to number of watermarked token and undetectable property.\n\nWe would like to reiterate that skipping watermarking is essential to ensure an unbiased watermark, thus preserving the output quality and undetectability.\n\nFor example, consider an instruction like \"generate a sequence of random 01 string\", and assume that the original language model generates perfect binary distribution. After saturation, i.e. after encountering all $2^n$ number of distinct n-grams, we must stop watermarking to avoid making the watermark detectable through n-gram frequency analysis. \n\nWe also would like to reiterate that there are straightforward modifications that can discard the $\\infty$-shot-undetectable property, and turn to weaker $n$-shot-undetectable property, in exchange for more watermarking opportunities. This is discussed in Section G.2."

Do you think it's worthwhile understanding well in what situations the proposed scheme works well, and when it fails. Or is that beyond the scope of the paper?\n\n>>\"In our previous response, we clarified the distinguishing factors between our gamma reweight and inverse sampling.

That was the point I was trying to make. I highlighted the LLR/Maximin LLR as useful novel contributions, but if you want me to consider them as part of the \"delta reweight\" scheme, sure. Then I will merge those bullet points.\n\n>>Thanks for running this. For Flan Llama, it doesn't seem like the AUC will be near 1.0 at a \"few\" tokens as claimed in your first response, even with the LLR scheme. Particularly, when you don't have access to the prompt.\n\n>>\"We humbly refrain from discussing the impact of RLHF on the entropy of language models, as it is beyond the scope of this paper and our research expertise.\"\n\nAs you said, the watermarking performance depends on the entropy. I think this understanding is crucial for evaluating whether the scheme proposed here can have a meaningful impact if deployed in the real world. Do the authors think that this is not of interest to their work?\n\nIf I understood correctly, your theory gives guarantees given underlying entropy but not about how much entropy actually is there. Hence my suggestion to capture an interesting set of tasks in your evaluations.\n\n>> Another question: If you're OpenAI, and watermark ChatGPT with your scheme, do you expect them to hand the verification service users their tokenizer for verification as well? I imagine it's a part of their secret sauce, and assuming access to the tokenizer is a strong assumption. This isn't really replicated in the experiments run with changing temperature and dropping a few words.\n\n>> \"We find that the gamma reweight method is able to substantially maintain watermark strength\" is this true even when switching models (e.g., changing tokenizers, and not just changing temperature)?\n\n>> \"a direct comparison between the two must be approached with caution.\" -- yes, they're testing different hypothesis but one of the tests uses a lot more information, and might perhaps be impractical in a lot of situations. It's good to understand the trade-offs since you won't be using both if you run a detection service in the real world, or are you saying you would somehow use both to make your decisions?"
