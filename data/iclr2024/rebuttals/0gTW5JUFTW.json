The key idea of TopoMLP is to leverage a simple yet effective approach based on MLP networks for topology reasoning. The authors also address the limitations of the topo metric of OpenLane V2 and provide an improved version. This topology reasoning algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the lane-lane and lane-traffic element relationship reasoning task on the OpenLane V2 datasets."

While it's true that Bezier curve may not perfectly represent the complexity of map elements, its has great potential for delivering superior results through piecewise Bezier curves. We'd like to draw your attention to a pivotal study titled \"End-to-end vectorized HD-map construction with piecewise Bezier curve\" (CVPR2023).  This research leverages piecewise bezier curve to obtain the state-of-the-art score in HD-map perception task. In addition, our method can be extended into other lane representation, such as the one in MapTR (Maptr: Structured modeling and learning for online vectorized hd map construction, ICLR2022). Maybe it can serve as the exploration of our future work.\n\n---\n\n**Q2:  About YOLOv8 outputs.**\n\n**A2:** Good comment! We make detailed clarification below.\n\n**Motivation of using YOLOv8:** Our framework for traffic detection is fully DETR-based. YOLOv8 is optional for the query initialization of our framework. The query initialization can also be randomized. Both solutions are not competitors yet different choices.\n\n**Why YOLOv8 performs better:** Randomly initialized query-based detector underperforms against using specific detector YOLOv8 as query initialization. We think this result is reasonable. This is due to the vast number of augmentation techniques, like mixup and mosaic aug when training YOLOv8. However, it is challenging to integrate these augmentation techniques into our end-to-end framework, which may hinder the performance of 3D lane detection.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: About visualization results.**\n\n**A3:** The results displayed in Fig.3 of our paper are not overfitting the dataset. Our model is able to predict that there are lanes in some invisible areas, even though the estimation of the lane quantity and length might not be perfect (see comparison between lane prediction and ground-truth in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/a0m3aow7m747tmo8mdwvm/h?rlkey=t7mlzvfsxim582i453y4hah30&dl=0)).\n\n---\n\nWe appreciate your thoughtful review and we hope to address your concerns. Please let us know if you'd like any further discussion."

Topology reasoning is essential for understanding road scenes and presenting drivable routes, requiring the detection of lane centerlines and traffic elements and reasoning their topology relationships, such as lane-lane and lane-traffic element topologies. The authors introduce a powerful 3D lane detector and an improved 2D traffic element detector, emphasizing the significance of detection performance on lane and traffic elements in influencing topology scores. They develop two simple MLP-based heads for topology generation, based on impressive detection performance. The proposed model, TopoMLP, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark and ranks 1st in the 1st OpenLane Topology in Autonomous Driving Challenge. The authors also identify a loophole in the current topology metrics, and propose a correctness factor to enhance it."

They highlight that with a detection score of 28.3, the topology score can only reach a maximum of 7.5, even if the topology reasoning results are identical to the ground truth.\n2. In the above scenario, their model achieves a topology score of 7.2. This demonstrates the model's superior performance in topology reasoning compared to other models evaluated using the OpenLane-V2 metrics.\n3. They propose using lane coordinate embedding and extra-supervision for interaction points to increasing LL topology reasoning performance. The LT topology can also benefited from view transformation embbeding and traffic element features.\n4. They have established a strong baseline framework for topology reasoning for autonomous driving, and plan to make it open-source, laying a solid foundation for subsequent work. They also pointed out a flaw in an existing metric, which has contributed to the advancement and refinement of this field."

Can you explain the main reason for the strong TOP_ll performance of your model compared to TopoNet?\n2. Although the introduction of YOLOv8 can significantly improve performance, why not directly use YOLOv8's features for LT relationship inference, but use its detection results as proposals of a DETR?\n3. Can you clarify why the \"adjusted TOP\" dropped in the \"enhanced prediction\"? Do the true positives and false positives in N_TP and N_FP refer to the matching in detection or topology?\n4. Some errors in manuscript:\n   - In Figure 2, the transformation matrix A is added to the Traffic Features. However, in Section 3.4, it is mentioned that it is \"summed with the lane query embedding.\"\n   - In Page 6, Section 4.2, the subscript of \"The loss coefficient of lane-traffic topology loss\" should be \"lt\" instead of \"ll\"."

                        "value": "We thank reviewer bKsZ for the valuable time and constructive feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Q1: Somewhat limited novelty.**\n\n**A1:** Thanks for your comment. In this work, we mainly contribute novel insights instead of a novel framework. After a set of in-depth analysis, we propose a \u201cfirst-detect-then-reason\u201d philosophy for better topology prediction. As the first step of topology prediction, detection has a greater impact on overall driving topology reasoning.\n\nMoreover, we would like to claim that complicated topology head is not necessary in this task. Please refer to the Table responding to Reviewer tnze.  Our simple MLP-based topology head (with SwinB backbone) can reach 95%(9.5/10.0) performance compared to using topology ground-truth, as shown in Fig.1 of our paper. An intuitive and elegant method like this can indeed be a good thing for the new emerging area.\n\nOverall, it's our hope that our discussions and methodology can offer fresh perspectives towards shaping the future of driving topology reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: The main reason for strong TOP_ll performance.**\n\n**A2:** Good comment! The superior TOP_ll score of our model is attributed to the fact that TopoMLP has a higher detection recall. Through our statistics, TopoNet yields a recall of 0.36, while TopoMLP achieves a recall of 0.54. This increased recall boosts the number of matched lanes, which in turn leads to improved topology scores.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Using YOLOv8\u2019s features.**\n\n**A3:** On the one hand, we use proposals from YOLOv8 as the query initialization of DETR-like framework.  It ensures the unity and elegance of our framework. On the other hand, directly using the object feature from YOLOv8 lacks detailed position information, which is very important for traffic-lane topology.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Clarification on adjusted TOP.**\n\n**A4:** Sorry for the confusion. \u2018Enhanced prediction\u2019 refers to pushing the prediction confidence to attack the official TOP metric, while our proposed \u2018adjusted TOP\u2019 is used to avoid this problem.The adjusted TOP introduces a correctness term (N_TP/(N_TP + N_FP)), which may be a strong penalty. The challenge organizer of OpenLane-V2 has took our advice and modified the TOP metric.  The true positives and false positives refer to the matching in topology.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: About typo.**\n\n**A5:** Thank you so much for your careful review! The transformation matrix A is summed with the lane query embedding. We will correct the figure and other typos.\n\n---\n\nWe appreciate your thoughtful review and we hope to address your concerns. Please let us know if you'd like any further discussion."

Using two simple MLP for the head is the core contribution I suppose. Is there any ablations to verify that using some complicated design (like a Transformer head) could \"downgrade\" the OLS score?\n\n2. Section 4.6 is a good contribution to the open-sourced community. Do authors communicate with organizers of the Challenge to reconsider the metric and maybe the leaderboard would be refreshed? On further consideration, the current OLS is a general metric. Is it good to design a separate metric to evaluate the topology performance at intersections (which is crucial I suppose)?\n\n3. This work generates the centerline of the lane, which is not the physical representation of the road scene. Is it a good formulation? On a higher level, I think the current form of Openlane-v2 tackles only partial challenges in the static road recognition. How to utilize the topoloy to faciliate downstream task? This could potentially trigger more future research in related domains.\n\n----\nMinor\n\n1. Topo in Figure 2. \"Topoogy\"\n2. G^LL in Equation 3 is the operation of Topology in Figure 2? I suggest to align the concept with equation and the figure.\n3. How to balance the different weights in Equation 5 of different branches? Are there some ablations or just equally distributed?"

                        "value": "We thank reviewer tnze for the valuable time and constructive feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Q1: About our motivation.**\n\n**A1:** Thanks for your comment.  In this work, we would like to demonstrate that a complicated topology head is not that necessary for driving topology reasoning. Instead, the design of high-performance detectors for lane and traffic element plays a more important role. Our MLP-based topology head, backed by ResNet50, has achieved 96% (7.2/7.5) performance relative to using topology ground-truth, based on Fig.1 in our paper.  Therefore, optimizing topology reasoning performance hinges on creating superior detectors, which presents a bottleneck in the process.\n\nConsidering the examples given in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/a0m3aow7m747tmo8mdwvm/h?rlkey=t7mlzvfsxim582i453y4hah30&dl=0), inaccurate detection (Fig.(a)) result in an unsatisfactory assessment of the topology, despite the seemingly advanced lane topology connection (Fig.(b)). Specifically, the evaluation of topology first involves the alignment of prediction and ground-truth lanes. Following this, the overlapped lanes are utilized for the extraction of predicted topology values, which enable the calculation of the graph-based mAP. If the lanes are undetected or not matched with the ground-truth lanes according to the Frechet distance (with varying thresholds), these topology values will be classified as negatives.\n\nIn summary, the basic detection is of great importance for the following topology reasoning, in such \u201cfirst-detect-then-reason\u201d pipeline. We hope these discussions will bring fresh perspectives to the developing field of driving topology reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Evaluation of other modules in topology head.**\n\n**A2:** Good comment! Following your suggestion, we evaluate two complicated topology heads, i.e.,  Transformer-based head and graph-based head. As shown in below table, our MLP-based head has similar performance with these two methods. It supports our opinion that a complicated topology head is not that necessary for driving topology reasoning.\n\n| Topology Head    | DET_l | DET_t | TOP_ll | TOP_lt | OLS  |\n| ------------------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |\n| Transfomer-based | 28.0  | 50.0  | 7.0    | 22.5   | 37.9 |\n| Graph-based      | 28.2  | 49.2  | 7.2    | 22.0   | 37.7 |\n| TopoMLP          | 28.3  | 50.0  | 7.2    | 22.8   | 38.2 |\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Discussion with organizers of the Challenge.**\n\n**A3:** Yes, we have discussed this problem with organizers of the Challenge. They have took our advice and decided to modify the TOP metric. The adjusted TOP metric will be used in the next competition. As for the separate metric on evaluating topology at interactions, it is indeed sigificiant and we will provide your feedback to discuss with challenge organizers.\n\n---\n\n**Q4: About the representation of centerline.**\n\n**A4:** Good comment! While the centerline of the lane is not the physical representation of the road scene, but it symbolizes a higher level idea, namely, the driving route. First,  the centerline at interactions can be formulated, defining potential routes at interactions or road convergences. Second, it can integrate traffic element information, providing a comprehensive perception of the road. Last but not least, the centerline of Openlane-v2 offers driving routes, which bring many benefits for downstream task that requires potential routes, such as motion prediction and ego-car planning. Overall, the common lane detection can be viewed as a parallel task with the driving topology reasoning. Both will promote the development of autonomous driving.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: Minor Questions.**\n\n**A5:** Thanks for your careful review. We will correct the typos and alignment. As for the hyparameters in Eq.5, we make some ablations for determining the values. The below table lists the results on different regression loss weights of lane detection head.\n\n| Lane reg weight | DET_l | DET_t | TOP_ll | TOP_lt | OLS  |\n| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | ------ |\n| 0.0075          | 26.6  | 49.8  | 7.0    | 21.4   | 37.3 |\n| 0.01            | 27.9  | 49.6  | 7.1    | 22.4   | 37.9 |\n| 0.02 (Ours)     | **28.3** | **50.0**  | **7.2**    | **22.8**   | **38.2** |\n| 0.05            | 28.2  | 49.6  | 7.0    | 22.0   | 37.8 |\n\n---\n\nWe appreciate your thoughtful review and we hope to address your concerns.

                        "value": "We thank reviewer MJLZ for the valuable time and constructive feedback.\n\n---\n\n**Q1: About TOP_ll score.**\n\n**A1:** Thanks for your careful review. We make detailed clarification below.\n\n**Why TOP numbers are low:** TOP_ll score is heavily limited by the lane detection performance. In specific, the topology evaluation first matches the predicted lanes and ground-truth lanes, and then bases the matched lanes to extract the predicted topology values for calculating graph-based mAP. If the lanes are not detected or matched with ground-truth in terms of Frechet distance (with different thresholds), the topology values will be regarded as negatives.  By the way, from Fig.1 in our manuscript, our TopoMLP with ResNet50 has achieved 96%(7.2/7.5) topology scores compared to using ground-truth topology. In a word, the topology performance depends heavily on detection performance.\n\n**Discussion on acceptable number:** Although some TOP_ll scores are low, their corresponding visualization performance is promising. For example, the sample from Fig.3 in our manuscript has only TOP_ll=2.8, while the topology connection across lanes looks acceptable (the thin lines are topology connections). This is because detection metric is strict, further leading to many unmatched lanes for topology evaluation and decreasing the topology scores. See the comparison between the lane prediction and ground-truth in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/a0m3aow7m747tmo8mdwvm/h?rlkey=t7mlzvfsxim582i453y4hah30&dl=0).\n\n**Possible solutions:** 1) Our research findings show that the effectiveness of detectors has a significant impact on the overall topology performance.  To boost basic detection performance, it requires additional time and effort. 2) It is still an open problem for feature alignment between 2D traffic element and 3D lane in a unified framework. 3) Utilizing a large language model could be a potential solution to address this driving reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: About typos.**\n\n**A2:** Thanks for pointing out this typo, and we will correct it in our revision.\n\n---\n\nWe appreciate your thoughtful review and we hope to address your concerns. Please let us know if you'd like any further discussion."
