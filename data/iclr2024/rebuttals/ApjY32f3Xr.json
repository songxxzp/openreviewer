                        "value": "Dear Reviewer xNZs,\n\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback and suggestions on improving our paper. Here we address responses to your questions.\n\n\n**Q1.** This work only compares PINN variants but did not look at other methods.\n\n**A1.** PINNs represent a highly significant and promising approach, with numerous studies dedicated to their improvement. Given the diverse range of enhancements applicable to PINNs, conducting a systematic comparison within this domain alone is a substantial undertaking that can guide the development of future methodologies.\n\n**Q2.** Details of the computer stuff needed for PINNs.\n\n**A2.** All our experiments were conducted using a Linux server with 20 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4210 CPUs @ 2.20GHz and eight NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti each with 12 GB GPU memory. We have included this information in **Appendix E.1**.\n\n**Q3.** How did you ensure that the PINN methods you evaluated were able to handle the diverse range of PDEs in your dataset, and what challenges did you encounter in this process?\n\n**A3.** The selection of PDEs for our benchmark was derived from a range of representative literature, encompassing typical equations categorized by their mathematical properties. Specifically, we chose 7 major categories of PDEs, relevant to various fields like fluid dynamics and electromagnetism. The primary challenge lay in the multitude of PDE types and the complexity of categorization. Our solution involved classifying PDEs by mathematical form, then grouping practical problems under these different types, and designing varying levels of difficulty.\n\n**Q4.** Can you describe the process of training the neural networks for each PDE, and how you optimized the hyperparameters for each method?\n\n**A4.** If I understand your question correctly, in our main experiments, we fixed certain hyperparameters like 1e-3 for learning rate, 8192/32768 for batch size, 20000 for epochs, etc., and adopted an approach of running three repetitions to ensure reproducibility. For hyperparameter selection, we initially studied the impact of some shared hyperparameters in **Figure 2, Figure 3, Appendix E.2** and chose a balanced parameter in terms of effectiveness and computational cost. For method-specific hyperparameters, detailed studies are provided in the appendix **Appendix E.2, Table 19~Table 26**.\n\n**Q5.** How did you handle issues such as boundary conditions and initial conditions in your experiments, and what strategies did you use to ensure that these conditions were satisfied?\n\n**A5.** Different types of PINN variants have their own approaches to handling boundary conditions. For instance, vanilla PINNs directly incorporate boundary conditions into the loss function combined with PDE loss, so the results may not strictly satisfy boundary conditions. Some methods, like FBPINNs, employ strategies such as hard constraints to restrict the solution space to a certain type of boundary conditions.\n\n**Q6.** Can you discuss the limitations of your benchmarking tool, and how future research could address these limitations to further advance the field of PINNs?\n\n**A6.** As a benchmark, its main limitation is the difficulty in continuously following new work and fairly, comprehensively testing its strengths and weaknesses. For future work, if researchers correctly use our benchmark for comparison, we can establish a leaderboard. This approach will make researchers aware of the current issues in PINNs and continue to drive progress in the field."

It would be more informative to show the mean and the standard deviations for the different parameter choices. The average L2RE can be skewed if one (or few) of the parameter settings fails (i.e., have L2RE of 100%) while others have very low errors (such as ~1e-4).\n\n\n[1] Wang, S., Sankaran, S., & Perdikaris, P.

Here we address responses to your questions.\n\n**Q1.** The paper is more suitable for an application/dataset track, for e.g., NeurIPS Dataset/Benchmark Track.\n\n**A1.** We appreciate your perspective, yet it's pertinent to note that at the ICLR Conference, numerous benchmark and dataset articles are accepted each year, as exemplified by references [1,2,3,4]. While benchmark articles may not introduce new techniques, they play a crucial role in highlighting existing issues in the field and guiding future research directions. Therefore, we respectfully request that you reconsider the contribution of our paper in this context.\n\n**Q2.** All of the selected SOTA methods fail on the KS Equation but some PINNs methods could solve it.\n\n**A2.** CausualPINNs represent a combination of various methods and techniques, and the training parameters and iteration numbers in their original work significantly differ from those in our study. Although their results suggest the resolution of the KS equation, it does not entirely apply under our problem settings. Given the plethora of improvements in PINN methods, we promise to gradually include more widely recognized, published, and effective works in our future research.\n\n**Q3.** Using averaged L2RE in parametric PDEs experiments is not a good indicator.\n\n**A3.** Due to the limited space in the main text, we only presented averaged L2RE, but comprehensive statistics, including mean and standard deviation, are provided in the appendix's **Table 27** for reference.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

I have read the other reviews and the authors' comments and have updated my score accordingly. I have a few follow-up comments regarding the paper:\n1. I would like to thank the authors for pointing out that benchmark papers are accepted at ICLR, which I was not familiar with, and I completely understand the importance of benchmarking for the community. As a side note, two of the four example benchmark papers [1, 2] mentioned by the authors are not purely benchmarks and they have algorithmic innovations. However, I do appreciate the efforts that the authors have put into this paper for creating a benchmark with diverse PDEs and PINN variants.\n2. From reading the other reviews and discussions, I also share the same concern as other reviewers that a journal format might be more suitable for this work as most of the interesting discussion of the results are in the Appendix.\n3. As a benchmark study, I feel it would further strengthen the paper if more detailed discussions about the results and the some deeper insights about them are included, as opposed to just reporting the results and suggesting suitable approaches. While I recognize the constraints of the ICLR format in terms of page limits, I believe that an expanded discussion could significantly enhance the paper's impact in the scientific ML community.\n4. **Minor Comment:** Although the major focus of this work has been on using PINNs for forward problems, the practical applications on PINNs are mostly for inverse problems which has not been extensively explored in this paper. If the authors are planning to extend the benchmark, it would be great to look into a more diverse set of inverse problems."

While they do exist in the appendix and carry out important information, they carry more scientific content than the existing paper's text.\n\n    To be clear, the paper's topic is certainly relevant to ICLR and could benefit the ICLR community. However, the conference format may not be the most suitable to present the work as best as it could have been.\n\n2. The work utilizes 10 different methods for training PINNs, but a brief description of these methods in a single mathematical framework is missing. Adding such a description and correlating the numerical findings to the theoretical properties of each method is probably the most important, yet under-performed, part of the work in my opinion.\n\n    To be clear, I understand the paper's space constraints, but this is very important in my opinion. The least the authors could do is to add such a section, however briefly, to the appendix."

Here we address responses to your questions.\n\n\n**Q1.** The conference format may not be the most suitable to present the work.\n\n**A1.** We acknowledge your concern regarding the format constraints. Due to space limitations, a considerable portion of our results and discussions had to be relegated to the appendix, which might inconvenience readers. However, it's worth noting that at the ICLR conference, many benchmark articles are accepted annually [1, 2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, the main conclusions of our article are presented in the main text, with the appendix serving primarily to supplement and corroborate these findings.\n\n**Q2.** A brief description of these methods in a single mathematical framework is missing.\n\n**A2.** Thank you for your valuable suggestion. It is important to note that different methods contribute to the improvement of PINNs in varied ways, hence we categorized these methods and described each category within a unified framework. Due to constraints in the main text's length, we have included these descriptions in an additional section denoted as **Appendix B.4**.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Given that PINNs seem to be mostly providing different function spaces for PDE solutions, one original base PINN should be included in the benchmark, which is to give each hat function on a finite element mesh one parameter, and hence include finite element methods. Because some of the data sets were created using FEM, the original mesh would yield 0 error, but different meshes may not, and in particular coarser meshes would accumulate error. Analyzing a curve of remeshing from same resolution to coarse would provide a baseline for the performances of the other PINNs.\n\n- In the above sense, it also becomes important to quantify flop counts. It appears that most PINNs need to be fitted for each PDE solution, incurring the typically high flop count of solving an optimization problem (compared to one forward pass), and only some of them can learn solutions conditional on hyperparameters given as input and require only forward passes to solve e.g. from different inital conditions.\nFor all cases, there should be 3 different flop counts provided: 1) The number of flops required to create the training set 2) The number of flops required for any general training of the method  3) the number of flops required to evaluate/fit the method on a particular example. Many PINNs, and the FEM baseline would only have nonzero counts in point 3, and it would be good to compare them.\nHaving flop counts or even wall time counts would allow answering questions like \"at equal error rate, does fitting a PINN or fitting FEM cost more computational power?\" and \"At equal computing power, can FEM beat the error rates of the listed PINNs?\"\n\n- continuing the discussion about flop counts, methods learning from multiple data sets/examples should be included in order to compare flop counts and provide additional reference error values. In particular for the time propagating PDEs, solutions using U-nets or FNOs from e.g. PDE bench should be included as reference values, in terms of performance, flops required for training, flops required to generate the required training data, and flops required to run a forward pass to obtain a solution. Then one can assess how many PINNs or FEM solutions one can compute for the same budget as a certain number of forward passes of the propagator network. The should be a break-even point at some number of forward passes justifying the training effort.\n\nWithout these points, the benchmark is unfortunately sitting just beyond actual widespread utility. I would highly encourage the authors to add these baselines to make the benchmark useful. Despite my positive bias towards benchmarking efforts I cannot recommend acceptance of this paper in its current state."

Here we address responses to your questions. \n\n**Q1.** The relative error values in the results tables are for the most part shockingly bad and simply not useful for many numerical analysis contexts.\n\n**A1.** In the experiments presented in this paper, a variety of metrics such as L2RE, L1RE, MSE, and Fourier error at different frequencies were employed to demonstrate the discrepancies between the predicted solutions and the true solutions. Importantly, the poor performance of L2RE in certain tasks is attributed to the deliberate selection of PDEs with varying degrees of difficulty. For instance, NS2d-LT and Heat2d-LT highlight the current challenges in mitigating error accumulation over long durations in PINNs, thereby drawing attention to this issue. Moreover, most PINN-related studies compare L2RE in their results; hence, our utilization of L2RE as a primary criterion facilitates a more effective comparison with other research findings.\n\n**Q2.** Analyzing a curve of remeshing from the same resolution to coarse.\n\n**A2.** Firstly, PINNs are not purely data-driven machine learning methods; they do not require a training set. Thus, even using original FEM grid points does not reduce the error to zero at these points. Secondly, we present the trend of L2RE variation with increasing grid points (corresponding to batch size) in **Table 15** and **Figure 2**, accompanied by an analysis in the main text.\n\n**Q3.** On using PINNs to predict FEM's hat function.\n\n**A3.** We believe that combining the strengths of PINNs and FEM in this manner could be an interesting approach worthy of in-depth investigation. However, as a benchmark, comparing this currently nascent method falls outside the scope of this paper. We anticipate considering its inclusion in our comparisons once more detailed related research is published in the future.\n\n**Q4.** Calculation of FLOPS.\n\n**A4.** We have listed the training and inference FLOPs of different methods across various PDEs in the **Table 13, Table 16, Appendix E.1**. As for the flops for data generation in main experiments, we only generate FEM solution for evaluating different approaches on a single instance per PDE. Thus the cost is negligible as we do not need parametric data like PDEBench. \n\n**Q5.** Comparison with methods like U-Net, FNO, etc.\n\n**A5.** In all our experimental settings for positive PDE problems, no data was provided; we sought to solve using PINNs solely based on the PDE itself. In contrast, neural operator methods such as FNO and U-Net are data-driven and, thus, are not applicable to our problem settings.\n\n**Q6.** Comparing datasets and PDEs with those used in PDEBench/PDEArena.\n\n**A6.** The PDEs we selected are not significantly related to those chosen in PDEBench or PDEArena. PDEBench and PDEArena primarily focus on time-dependent PDEs like compressible Naiver-Stokes equations, Diffusion Reaction equations, etc. Moreover, their complexity is such that PINNs often fail to solve them correctly or yield substantial errors. Our selection of PDEs, derived from various PINN publications, encompasses a diverse range of types and complexities. For common PDEs, we selected the incompressible Naiver-Stokes equation and the Poisson equation (Darcy flow) due to their representativeness and widespread applicability in numerous fields."
