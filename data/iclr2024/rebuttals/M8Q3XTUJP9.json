                    "value": "This paper studies the influence on the number of parameters (over- vs. underparameterization) on the learned features. In particular, the work investigates whether a concatentation of independently trained underparameterized networks (with similar parameter count) retrieves the expressive power and performance of an overparameterized network. To scale networks, the work employs scaling of network widths, while keeping other network hyperparameters, such as depth, fixed (Sec. 2.1 & 2.3). To analyze feature similarity, they introduce some metrics: feature span error (Sec. 2.2), feature span gap (based on FSE; Sec. 3.2), and feature performance (Sec. 2.4). They find that underparameterized networks cannot fully capture the features of overparameterized networks, and vice versa (Sec. 3.2). Thus, they conclude that the networks seem to learn distinct features. Further, the features from the overparameterized have higher predictive prowess (Sec. 3.3). Finally, the work provides a toy example to show that some features can only be learned by overparameterized networks (Sec. 4)."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "* The research question has significant flaws. That is, independently trained underparameterized networks are likely to converge to similar feature representations, as each of them tries to minimize the target loss and, thus, only the features with the largest effect on the target loss are learned (given the more restrictive capacity constraint from the width scaling). On the other hand, overparameterized networks do not suffer from such an issue and can use their larger capacity during training to learn more (and other) features to further reduce the target loss. Consequently, this raises substantial concerns about the empirical findings.\n\n* The paper is hard to follow. For example, the varying notation makes it hard to read without keeping track of notation and resolving ambiguities. E.g., why is $\\beta$ needed if $\\alpha$ suffices and seems to also be used interchangeably by the authors, e.g.:\n   * Eq. 2.1\n   * vs. \u201clinear combination of the features $\\lbrace m_{\\beta}(x_k)[s]\\rbrace^{\\beta n_L}_{s=1}$\u201d (p. 3)\n   * vs. $\\lbrace m_{\\beta}(x_k)[s]\\rbrace^{\\alpha n_L}_{s=1}$ (p. 4))?\n\n* Besides the above, the paper seems partially unordered. E.g., why are the proposed metrics interleaved with the setup on how the networks are scaled?\n\n* The introduced metric \u201cfeature performance\u201d is only a linear probe and not an original contribution of the work.\n\n* The feature residual analysis has contradictory results (Fig. 4a vs. 4b and Fig. 10). For the transformer setting, it is quite clear that the residual features help in predictive performance. However, for the ResNet setting this is not clear, as for $\\alpha=1/8$ and $\\alpha=1/16$ the difference is negligible. There is no discussion on this.\n\n* Sec. 4 seems to reiterate the lottery ticket hypothesis (the initial weights are particularly effective or ineffective for training). It is unclear how this relates to the empirical findings of the present work."

                    "value": "* Do the authors ensure the same random initialization between the overparameterized and the underparameterized networks (assuming that layer widths are integer multiples of $\\alpha$)?\n\n* How do the underparameterized networks perform on the target task compared to the overparameterized network?\n\n* Seemingly, the underparameterized CIFAR-10 models improve their predictive performance for $\\alpha=1/2$ in Fig. 3. Is there any explanation by the authors for why?\n\n* How are the feature residual experiments conducted? I.e., how are these features \u201cappended\u201d? Is a new linear mapping $W^{(L+1)}$ learned for the additional features?\n\n* How is the MLP scaled in Sec. 4?\n\n## Suggestions\n\n* As mentioned above, the paper would be easier to follow by substantially improving the presentation. For example, instead of $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ in Def. 2.2, it would be easier if the authors would just use $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ instead.\n\n* Table 1 should be within the page size limits."

We address their concerns as follows: \n\n**\"Independently trained underparameterized networks are likely to converge to similar feature representationss, as each of them tries to minimize the target loss \"**\\\nAlthough the reviewer's claim may have a point, it does not necessarily hold. The learning process of each network can be different depending on their initialization. It is a noisy process and smaller networks may be learning some bad quality (noisy or redundant) features and these features may not help in the test set. \n\\\nMoreover, for instance, in our toy example (Section 4), all the networks have the capacity (enough neurons) to learn all the features but still they need to be large enough to learn all.\n\n**\"The introduced metric \u201cfeature performance\u201d is only a linear probe and not an original contribution of the work.\"**\\\nWe apologize for the confusion. We already state FSG is a linear probe in the paper and we will make it clearer. Our work differs from the previous work in how we utilize FSG. \n\n**\"The feature residual analysis has contradictory results (Fig. 4a vs. 4b and Fig. 10).\"**\\\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We apologize that Fig 4b is wrongly plotted. Plots in the figure are shown to be plotted for decreasing $\\alpha$ but they are indeed plotted for increasing $\\alpha$. That is why Figure 4b seems contradictory but the results in reality are not. \n\n**\"Sec. 4 seems to reiterate the lottery ticket hypothesis (the initial weights are particularly effective or ineffective for training). It is unclear how this relates to the empirical findings of the present work.\"**\\\nIn section 4, our setup leads to many neurons to be dead at initialization. We wanted to point out that that is realistic as the lottery ticket hypothesis show."

Initialization may lead to slight differences but I would still expect that they remain quite similar to each other. Regarding Section 4, I do not see the novel insight beyond the lottery ticket hypothesis. Thus, to reiterate my question: how does this relate to the empirical findings of the work?

Please note that when $\\alpha < 1/8$,  Table 2 shows a very similar training accuracy (99.81 - 99.99) but different validation accuracy (92.72 -95.29). Table 1 ($\\alpha < 1/8$) doesn't reflect feature differences.\n- The proposed FSE score (Definition 2.2.) is a common metric. [1 (iclr)] shows (almost) the same feature score.

We address their concerns as follows: \n\n**\"The feature difference can come from well-learned / poorly-learned networks instead of overparameterized / underparameterized networks.\"** \\\nOur purpose is to create smaller (underparameterized) networks that has number of parameters comparable to the data size. Hence, we cannot use resnet18 as the lowest degree model in our experiments since it has much more paramaters than the data size. \n\\\nMoreover, we train all the networks for 300 epochs. Since smaller networks ($\\alpha \\le 1/8$) do not achieve a training accuracy close to 100 with 300 epochs, we also tried training these networks much longer. Although training much longer helped somewhat increasing the training accuracy, it either decreased or very marginally increased the validation accuracy. It is also natural that smaller (underparameterized) networks may not achieve a perfect training accuracy due to their capacity. \n\\\nLastly, we concatenate many smaller networks to match the parameters of the large network. It could have been enough to match the number of features in the large network for a fair comparison. In that sense, we over-concatenate for a stronger empirical finding and still FSE scores of these concatenations are significantly high.\n\n**\"The proposed FSE score (Definition 2.2.) is a common metric.\"**\\\nWe do not claim that FSE is a completely different metric from the previous ones. FSE is indeed used in [3] and we mentioned this (citing it) in our paper. The novelty of our paper lies in the use of FSE and FSG to compare the features between low- and high-width networks. Our papers also mentions some other similarity metrics too. Our work significantly differs from the literature in the way it utilizes FSE and FSG."

                        "value": "Thanks for your answer. As the title says \"How does overparametrization affect features?\", this work tries to investigate the features learned by overparametrized networks and compare these features with non-overparameterized (aka, underparameterized) networks. To compare features of two models (over- / under-parameterized), one requirement is to at least have a similar training loss. Otherwise, one can not know whether the different features come from over- / under-parameterized model or the well / poorly-training process. \n\nFor example, with the exact same network (e.g. resnet18), one can train it with different hyperparameters to achieve different training losses. Then the resulting features could also be very different."

The experiments did not scale past the CIFAR and MNLI scale.\n3. I think there are some related works that should have been discussed.

My biggest reservation about the paper is that there are multiple ways of comparing the similarity of neural representations. This paper introduces the FSE and FSG, but I do not see why prior methods were not considered. At a minimum, these deserve discussion. Section V.G of [Rauker et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13243) discusses single neuron alignment, vector space alignment, CCA, singular vector CCA, CKA, deconfounded representation similarity, layer reconstruction, model stitching, representational similarity analysis, and probing.

I would not be shocked if the main result from 3.2 didn\u2019t hold much for a nonlinear version of FSE.\n6 I see no error bars in some of the figures. Were these results based on one trial?

We address their concerns as follows:\n\n**\"The experiments did not scale past the CIFAR and MNLI scale.\"**\\\nWe preferred smaller scale experiments because for our results we solve many regression problems that becomes computationally very expensive as the dataset and the networks grow.\n\n**\"My biggest reservation about the paper is that there are multiple ways of comparing the similarity of neural representations.\"**\\\nAs we state in our introduction, our focus (with FSE and FSG) is not on similarity  rather the expressivity that is dictated by the features in last layer of a network. The similarity between A and B  is the same as similarity between B and A but that is not the case for expressivity. FSE and FSG help us understand the expressive power of the features of different size networks relative to each other and quality of the feature on a given task.\n\n**\"Why use a linear layer to define the FSE? Why not allow yourself to use a nonlinear layer?\"**\\\nAs explained in Section 2.2, the model makes predictions based on the linear combination of its (last layer) features - each output neuron (before softmax) is linear combination of these features. Hence, the expressive power of a model is dictated by the linear span of the last hidden layer features (that is only the case for the last hidden layer), and this expressive power does not depend on non-linear relationships between the last hidden layer features. This expressive power's dependence on the linear combination of these features is the basis of the FSE measure, which quantifies one model's expressive capacity with respect to another.\n\n**\"I see no error bars in some of the figures. Were these results based on one trial? Or are the error bars too small to see?\"**\\\nError bars are too small to see in most cases. Experiments are averaged over 5 trials."

But this seems to itself be a big limitation of what the paper does, right? I would imagine that we should care about others as well. Other methods of comparing representational similarities of which I know have been applied in a more versatile way."
