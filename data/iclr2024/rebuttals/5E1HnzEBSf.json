Including a comparison of computational efficiency in the experiments would make the argument more convincing.\n\n3. Ablation study. From Figure 5, it is evident that LSS without diversity term and affinty term (i.e., $\\lambda_a = \\lambda_b = 0$) achieves an accuracy of $62.0\\\\%$, which still outperforms baselines in Table 1. How to explain this observation?\n\n4. Further explanations, such as error landscape visualizations, would be beneficial to elucidate how the proposed diversity and affinity terms enhance performance."

                        "value": "**1. Addressing Novelty Concerns:**\n   Thank you for highlighting the importance of novelty in our work. The core novelty of our paper lies in the improved and efficient model soup method into federated learning (FL) with pre-trained models to drastically reduce communication rounds. This approach, particularly in the context of pre-training FL, represents a novel contribution to the field. Our experimental results across various datasets, model architectures, and FL non-iid settings demonstrate its effectiveness, which we believe is a significant contribution in FL research.\n\n**2. Computational Efficiency of the Diversity Term:**\n   We appreciate your concern about the computational efficiency of the diversity term. To address this, we conducted an empirical evaluation of the computational overhead. Our findings indicate that the diversity term results in only a marginal increase in runtime (about 5%) for a typical model pool size of 4.\n\n**3. Ablation Study and Figure 5 Observation:**\n   The results shown in Figure 5, where LSS without diversity and affinity terms still outperforms baselines, underscore the effectiveness of our connecting-preserving random model interpolation module. This module, a key component of our method, significantly contributes to the overall performance by enhancing the connectivity between local low-loss regions. The absence of the diversity and affinity terms in this scenario highlights the standalone impact of our interpolation technique, reinforcing the value it brings to the local model training process in FL.\n\n**4. Error Loss Landscape and Further Explanations:**\n   In response to your suggestion for further explanations, we provide data in Appendix E.2 on the flatness quantification of loss landscape to further show how our method enhances the local training performance and is located in a common low-loss region. This addition should provide a clearer understanding of the underlying mechanisms of our approach.\n\nYour feedback is helpful in refining our work, and we hope these revisions and explanations address your concerns satisfactorily."

                    "value": "The paper studies the problem of pre-trained model adaptation in a federated learning (FL) setting. While existing work (Nguyen et al. 2022) have shown the benefit of using pre-trained models in FL, they still require significant number of communication rounds between clients and server to reach good accuracy. At the same time, centralized fine-tuning methods (model soup, DiWA) cannot be easily extended to the federated setting due to their significant computational cost. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose Local Superior Soups (LSS), an efficient and local model interpolation-based method. LSS consists of three main innovations - a random interpolation method to speed up the model selection step, a loss term encouraging the models in the model pool to be more diverse and a loss term penalizing the distance of the candidate models to the initial model (affinity). Experimental results are provided on FMNIST, CIFAR10, Digit5 and DomainNet showing that the proposed LSS outperforms other heterogeneity tackling FL algorithms and also other weight/model averaging algorithms."

                    "value": "* Section 3.2 seems to be mostly a rehash of existing work and can be significantly shortened I feel. For instance, the result in Theorem 1 has already been derived in [1] (see Table 1). A version of Proposition 3.1 has also been stated in Nguyen et al. 2022 (see Equation 3). Therefore I do not find any novelty in this section. There are also a few typos which complicate reading. For instance, it should be $f$ and not $f_i$ in the definition of $\\zeta$. The authors also write that \"there is an additional error term in the convergence rate that monotonically increases with the number of local steps (see the 3rd term of the RHS of Eq. 2)\". I don't quite understand this. The 3rd term has a $\\tau^{-1/3}$ and therefore it should decrease as $\\tau$ increases right? The authors main message is that there is a limited gain we can get by increasing the number of local steps, which is fairly intuitive and does not need such a lengthy explanation.  \n\n* The paragraph explaining why connected low-loss valley +pre-trained initialization can achieve extreme communication rounds reduction is purely based on hypothesis with no empirical/theoretical evidence. It would be good to verify that some of conclusions drawn in that paragraph (smaller $d$, lower $\\beta$, smaller $\\zeta$) hold empirically in practice. \n\n* The authors should add a separate algorithm environment for the RandomInterpolation subroutine that is called within the LSS Pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. Currently the Random Interpolation is only described in words, making it hard to understand exactly what the authors are doing. Also the authors make the claim that 'this integration ensures that the models selected for interpolation are inherently aligned within the same low-loss valley'. Why is this the case? What is special about the random interpolation that ensures that selected models are well aligned? Also is there anything specific to FL for the random interpolation or can it be applied to the centralized setting? If so, the authors should highlight this as I believe reducing the computation cost of model soup methods is a concern in the centralized setting as well.\n\n* Experimental results are mostly conducted on a small number of client ($M = 5$) which reduces the difficulty introduced by client heterogeneity in FL. Experimental results would be more convincing if they are conducted on more realistic FL settings, like those studied in Nguyen et al. 2022 with $M > 100$ clients and partial participation."

                    "value": "* I was wondering if the authors have taken care to ensure a fair comparison between FedAvg and LSS. For instance, LSS involves clients training multiple local models which would entail a much higher computational cost than training just one local model. It would be good to add a figure/table comparing the computation cost of all the algorithms for some specific model/dataset.\n\n* Fixing the number of local steps to be 8 seems to be restrictive, especially considering that there are only $5$ clients, so each client will have around $10$k data-points. Have the authors actually verified that using more than $8$ steps leads to a decrease in performance?\n\n* Why is the performance of LSS so much better than other model-soup methods (second big row of results in Table 1 and Table 2)? Based on my understanding, these methods are performing a more sophisticated and computationally expensive model selection phase?\n\n* Please re-define the variable $i$ in Algorithm 1. Earlier $i$ was used to denote the index of the clients (Eq. (1)) which makes Algorithm 1 confusing at first glance. There is also a typo in the expression \"connecting preserving\" in Line 7 Algorithm 1. \n\n* In the first paragraph of Section 3, the words firstly, secondly and finally should not be capitalized.\n\n* It would be good to add the performance of all FL baselines (such as MOON, FedProx, FedBN, FedFomo, FedBABU) for the results in Figure 3, in order to make a stronger claim on reducing the number of communication rounds.\n\n\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Woodworth, Blake E., Kumar Kshitij Patel, and Nati Srebro. \"Minibatch vs local sgd for heterogeneous distributed learning.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 6281-6292."

                        "value": "**1. Length of Section 3.2 and Typos:**\n   We appreciate your observation regarding the length of Section 3.2. In response, we have succinctly revised this section to better highlight our unique contributions while referencing prior works for context. And we also correct the typos and refine our explanations to be more precise. We also provide the empirical studies in Appendix E.2 for verifying the limited gains achievable by increasing the number of local steps arbitrarily.\n\n**2. Empirical Validation of Hypotheses:**\n   To address the concern about the lack of empirical validation, we have included new empirical studies in the Appendix E.2. These studies test our hypotheses on communication rounds reduction and provide evidence supporting our assertions on improving smoothness (reducing $\\beta$).\n\n**3. Detailed Description of Random Interpolation:**\n   In line with your suggestion, we have added an algorithmic comparison of the Random Interpolation subroutine in the Section 3.3.1 and the Appendix E.2. This addition aims to clarify our methodology and its unique benefits, particularly in ensuring model alignment within low-loss valleys.\n\n**4. Client Scale in Experimental Setup:**\n   Our algorithm primarily focuses on the cross-silo federated learning setting, hence the number of clients in our experiments is usually set to be within 100. In the appendix, we have included experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with 50 clients on the CIFAR10 dataset.\n\n**5. Comparative Analysis of Computational Overhead:**\n   To ensure a fair comparison between FedAvg and LSS, we have added a comparative analysis of computational overheads in the Appendix E.2. This includes a table comparing the computational costs across different methods. While our method requires more memory during training, compared to other soups-based methods, our overall computation time is faster within a communication round.\n\n**6. Local Epochs and Model Performance:**\n   Regarding the fixed number of local steps, additional experiments have been conducted to show the optimal number. The results, now included in the Appendix E.2, demonstrate that increasing the local epochs beyond 8 leads to diminishing returns in performance, validating our initial choice.\n\n**7. Performance Comparison with Other Model Soup Methods and Explanations:**\n   To address your query on LSS's superior performance, we have included a detailed analysis in Section 1. This analysis contrasts LSS with other model soup methods, emphasizing the importance of our proposed three key modules: random model interpolation, diversity and affinity regularization term. We improve the inefficient training approach of the previous soup-based model, which involved training a large number of models and then filtering them. Instead, we have adopted the random model interpolation method to maintain the connectivity of various candidate models during the training process. Moreover, we incorporate two regularization terms to increase model diversity and enhance connectivity between models to reduce the time for training unnecessary models, thereby improving training efficiency.\n\n**8. Clarifications and Typo Corrections:**\n   We have redefined ambiguous variables in Algorithm 1 for clarity and corrected the identified typographical errors, including the expression \"connecting preserving\" and capitalization in Section 3.\n\n**9. Additional FL Baseline Performance Data:**\nThank you for your suggestion to include additional FL baselines in Figure 3. However, our primary objective with Figure 3 is to emphasize the fast convergence achieved by our LSS method. The inclusion of FedAvg as a comparison baseline is intended to clearly demonstrate this aspect. Adding more baselines, while potentially informative, might not substantially contribute to this specific narrative focus.\n\nYour thorough review has been invaluable in enhancing the quality and clarity of our work. We are grateful for your time and effort, and we remain open to any further suggestions or discussions."

Federated learning inherently leads to parameter heterogeneity across local devices, which may result in diminished model performance. To counteract this, the authors introduce a novel algorithm termed Local Superior Soups (LSS). The algorithm performs interpolation between randomly chosen local models during each local training phase. This interpolated model tends to be more stable, thereby enhancing its generalizability when integrated into FedAVG. For local training, two cost functions are also proposed, aimed at enhancing model diversity and affinity. These facilitate a more effective interpolation process and generally contribute to building a superior global model. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm."

For example, the proposition 3.1, I understand the authors would like to convey $\\tau$ has an upper bound thus can not be arbitrarily increased to decrease $R$. However, this seems never really referred to or validated in the rest of the paper. \n\n- There are also several places unclear to me also in the theory part. For example, the authors claim \"there is an additional error term in the convergence rate that monotonically increases with the number of local steps\", which refers to the 3rd term of RHS. However, isn't the $\\tau$ in the denominator?\n\nAnd the main motivation of the model averaging is the authors claim the $\\beta$, which is the Lipschitz constant, will be controlled by LSS. However, I do not see any validation of such connection except for some intuition-based argument. Thus, whether the logic can go through remains unclear to me.\n\n- Based on my understanding, LSS replaces the multiple runs in model soups, which require several different hyperparameter specifications, with an iterative model averaging, i.e., average models continuously along with the optimization path. Basically, similarly to SWA? Currently the presentation of random interpolation is a bit confusing due to overcomplicated description.\n\n- About the experimental setup, the authors describe using different local update steps for different approaches. I am not very clear about the reasoning. Is there any figure or table showing FedAvg cannot take more local steps? And how to ensure a fair comparison in this different local update regime."

To address this, we have included an empirical verification in Appendix E.2 concerning FL methods for reducing communication rounds, which cannot be achieved simply by increasing local epochs.\n\n3. **Clarification on Additional Error Term in Convergence Rate:** \n  Thanks for your correction. In the revised version, Section 3.2 has been updated to provide a clearer explanation and the correct error term index.\n\n4. **LSS Smoothness:** \n  In response, we have included empirical studies in Appendix E.2. These studies demonstrate the effect of LSS on the improved smoothness and provide evidence to support our theoretical claims.\n\n5. **Comparison with Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Random Interpolation:** \n  To clarify the differences with SWA and the concept of random interpolation, we have revised Section 3.3. This includes a more straightforward and less complicated description of our methodology, differentiating it from existing techniques like SWA.\n\n6. **Experimental Setup and Rationale for Different Local Update Steps:** \n  To address this, we have added new empirical evidence in Appendix E.2, showcasing the reasoning behind choosing different local steps for FedAvg.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the time and effort you have put into reviewing our work. Your feedback has been instrumental in enhancing the clarity and rigor of our manuscript. If any part of our response requires further elaboration or discussion, please let us know."
