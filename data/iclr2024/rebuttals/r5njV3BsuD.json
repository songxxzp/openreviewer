The authors revisit the analysis of Chen et al. 2023a/b and improve upon it in terms of dimensional dependence (from $d^2$ to $d$, which is further argued to now be optimal). This improvement stems from a refined discretization analysis using ideas from the stochastic localization literature."

There are some caveats here that I detail below but this is nothing that cannot be adressed by a round of further proof-reading. Although I did not check the appendix in sufficient detail to vouch for correctness, I think their math is generally OK to follow.\n\n- In terms of originality, the authors observe that Conforti et al. have produced a similar result in a parallell submission. I don't see this as an issue for publishing this manuscript at ICLR. I think it is safe to say that these have been developed in parallell and given the different techniques used they are both independently of each other of interest to the community---in my view the ideas herein are fairly original and interesting."

I do have a few remarks on writing though:\n\n- The notation is a little messy throughout and feels somewhat rushed/needs further proofreading. There are quite a few undefined/implicitly defined objects. Let me give a few examples:\n\n    -  Previous to stating the main theorem, the main object of interest $p_{t_N}$ has never been defined. \n    - The use of bold $\\mathbf{x}$  for realization when defining conditional objects is a little confusing when at the same time $\\mathbf{x}_*$ is a random variable. This is also in conflict with the use in equation 3 where $\\mathbf{x}_t$ is a random variable drawn from $q_t$. It would be helpful if there was a consistent distinction between realization and random object throughout and if this were defined early in the manuscript.\n   -  The notation for conditional expectation given the observation (function $\\mathbf{a}$)  following eqn 6 is unnecessarily dense. In particular, that the LHS depends on $U_s$ whereas the RHS depends on $\\mu_s$ is a little confusing at first glance. It would be good if the authors were a little more parsimonious and consistent in their notation---at least when introducing objects for the first time.\n\n\n*Other comments*:\n\n\n- Following Lemma 1 it would not hurt to expound a little on the significance of the covariance matrix and why it will be useful in the sequel. It would be nice if some version of what is stated \"inside\" the proof of thm 1, second paragraph, appears near this lemma.\n\n- Above equation (9) there is an extraneous square in the definition of the Frobenius norm (and the square root should probably be outside of the trace)"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their positive and detailed comments on our work. Regarding the reviewer's remarks on the writing and notation, we acknowledge the points of confusion and apologize for the lack of clarity in the original version. We will take on board the suggestions regarding the definitions of $p_{t_N}$, $\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{x}_\\ast$, and $\\mathbf{a} (U_s)$ and update the notation in the camera-ready version. We will provide an updated manuiscript reflecting the changes below by tomorrow.\n\n> Following Lemma 1 it would not hurt to expound a little on the significance of the covariance matrix and why it will be useful in the sequel.\n\nThe covariance matrix $\\mathbf{\\Sigma_t}$ is significant since it can be related to the Jacobian of the score function (see Lemma 4). Thus, controlling $\\mathbf{\\Sigma_t}$ as in Lemma 1 allows us to control the Jacobian of the score function. In turn, this allows us to control time-discretization terms of the form $E_{s,t} := \\mathbb{E}[||\\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2]$ via Ito calculus (see Lemmas 2 and 3). We will include a discussion of this intuition for Lemma 1, coming from the proof of Theorem 1, after the statement of Lemma 1 in the camera-ready version.\n\n> Above equation (9) there is an extraneous square in the definition of the Frobenius norm (and the square root should probably be outside of the trace)\n\nThank you for spotting this; we will correct this in the camera-ready version.\n\n> With regard to the second of part of assumption 2---you mention that your analysis is not dependent on \"it\"---I have clarifying question: would the result incur extra \"condition numbers\" or does it still work even if this covariance matrix has 0 or near 0 eigenvalues?\n\nNo, we do not incur extra condition numbers, and the result still holds if the covariance matrix has zero or near zero eigenvalues. For an arbitrary covariance matrix, our bounds may occur a linear dependence on $M_2 = \\mathbb{E}[||x_0||^2]$ instead of $d$, but are essentially very similar in spirit. For a more detailed analysis of what exactly must be changed in our proofs and the form of the resulting bound, see our response to Reviewer 73Lh's point number 3.\n\n> Could you expand on the steps taken in equation (9)? I do not immediately see how this follows from the standard Ito Isometry relating squares of stochastic integrals and integrals of their squares.\n\nOf course; our additional exposition was probably too brief. First, writing $\\textup{d} (e^t \\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t)) = \\sqrt{2} e^t \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) \\cdot \\textup{d} B_t'$ in integral form we get\n\\begin{equation*}\n    e^t \\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - e^s \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s) = \\int_s^t  \\sqrt{2} e^r \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r}(Y_r) \\cdot \\textup{d} B_r'\n\\end{equation*}\nBy the standard form of Ito's isometry applied to this integral, we get (under suitable integrability conditions)\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\Big|\\Big| \\int_s^t  \\sqrt{2} e^r \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r}(Y_r) \\cdot \\textup{d} B_r' \\Big|\\Big|^2 \\Big] & = \\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\int_s^t (\\sqrt{2} e^r \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r}(Y_r) \\cdot \\textup{d} B_r')^T(\\sqrt{2} e^r \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r}(Y_r) \\cdot \\textup{d} B_r') \\Big] \\\\\\\\\n    & = \\mathbb{E}\\Big[\\int_s^t 2 e^{2r} || \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r} (Y_r)||^2_F \\textup{d} r \\Big]\n\\end{align*}\nCombining both expressions and exchanging the order of itnegration on the RHS, we have\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\mathbb{E}[||e^t \\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - e^s \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2] = 2 e^{2r} \\int_s^t \\mathbb{E}[|| \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r} (Y_r)||^2_F] \\textup{d} r.\n\\end{equation*}\nEquation (9) then follows by differentiating with respect to $t$.\n\n> Following the statement of proposition 4 could you be a little more precise/remind us about which stochastic transformation is used in the invokation of the data-processing inequality? It seems like it is here the early stopping idea is used but I find it hard to follow.\n\nWe are applying the data processing inequality with the transformation $f : (\\omega_t)  \\mapsto \\omega_{t_N}$ which takes a path $(\\omega_t) \\in C([0,t_N], \\mathbb{R})$ on $[0,t_N]$ and returns its endpoint. Under this transformation, $Q$ and $P^{\\pi_d}$ are mapped to $q_\\delta$ and $p_{t_N}$ respectively. (This is a similar argument to that used in Chen et al. (2023d).)"

Several auxiliary results are known in the literature or can be adapted from known results in a straightforward way. However, proofs for many of these results are still given in the appendix.

Or am I mis-interpreting the meaning of second moment of a distribution on R^d?\n\n3. It is claimed that the isotropic condition in Assumption 2 is not essential. However, this has never been formally justified, if I'm not missing it. Which nuisance of the proof needs to be changed if the covariance is general? In fact, I have some doubt on the claim that this assumption is immaterial. What if the covariance is not strictly positive definite? What if the covariance is **unknown**?\n\n4. In the line following equation (9), there seems to be some typos in the equations for verifying the applicability of Fubini. \n\n5. Right before the statement of Lemma 6, it's claimed that the existence of t_M = T-1 is WLOG. This is likely technical but I suggest briefly justify it. I guess if this does not hold, a tiny approximation error needs to be introduced.\n\n6. Please introduce the notation $\\lesssim$ somewhere if it's not been done yet. I assume that this means the LHS is upper bounded by the RHS multiplied by a numerical constant. \n\n7. It's argued informally in section 4 (with some details in appendix G) that the linear dependence of the convergence rate on d is necessary. \nThis seems like a nice observation. Is it possible to turn it into a formal proposition and specify how this lower bound depends on other parameters besides d? In fact, this observation is a little surprising to me since for product distribution, the problem is effectively 1-dimensional however denoising diffusion still incurs a dimension-dependence. Could the authors offer some more intuition? Thanks in advance."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their detailed engagement with our work and thoughtful comments and suggestions. In response to the questions raised by the reviewer:\n\n1. We agree this is a sensible suggestion, and will update the title to \"Nearly $d$-Linear Convergence Bounds for Diffusion Models via Stochastic Localization\".\n\n2. Yes, the first part of Assumption 2 is technically superfluous. We chose to state it in this way to separate the assumption that the data distribution has finite second moments (which is absolutely required by our methods) and the assumption that $p_{\\textup{data}}$ is isotropic (which can be weakened, see next comment).\n\n3. The main changes required are in the proofs of Lemmas 5 and 6 and Proposition 4. Suppose that instead of assuming that $\\textup{Cov} (p_{\\textup{data}}) = I_d$, we only assume that we have finite second moments and let $M_2 = \\mathbb{E}[||x_0||^2]$. Then, Lemmas 2, 3 and 4 hold unchanged. Also, the proof of (13) can be adapted, replacing each time we use $ \\mathbb{E}[||x_0||^2] = d$ with $ \\mathbb{E}[||x_0||^2] = M_2$; we find that all instances of $M_2$ cancel in the final result and so Lemma 5 also holds unchanged. The only change in the proof of Lemma 6 comes at the top of page 18, where we find instead that $\\mathbb{E}[\\textup{Tr}(\\mathbf{\\Sigma_t})] \\leq M_2$ for $t \\in [1,T]$. We deduce that Lemma 6 holds almost unchanged, except the RHS of (17) should contain an additional term of $\\kappa M_2$. The final change that must be made is in Proposition 4, where the bound becomes $\\lesssim (d + M_2) e^{-2T}$ (this can be easily seen from the proof). Putting this all together, we end up with the final result that $\\textup{KL}(q_{\\delta}||p_{t_N}) \\lesssim \\varepsilon^2_{\\textup{score}} + \\kappa^2 d N + \\kappa d T + \\kappa M_2 + (d + M_2) e^{-2T}.$ This bound holds even in the case where the covariance is not strictly positive definite, and in the case that it is unknown in advance. Since we expect $M_2$ to scale linearly in $d$, we consider this result to be in essentially the same spirit as Theorem 1, with only minor adaptations required.\n\n4. Thank you for drawing our attention to this line. In fact, in the first version of the manuscript, we made a mistake when giving the relevant inequalities which permit the application of Fubini. As can be seen from writing out the application of Ito's isometry in full (see our response to Reviewer wcsw below), the correct justification should be $\\int_s^t e^{2r} \\mathbb{E}[||\\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-r}(Y_r)||._F^2] \\textup{d} r < \\infty$ (which follows from (13), as stated above equation (9)). We will correct this in the camera-ready version.\n\n5. Indeed this is merely a technicality, and our justification is as follows. If we wanted to work in full generality, we would instead define $M$ to be an index such that $t_M \\in [T-2, T-1]$, noting that this must exist since the step size $\\gamma_k$ satisfies $\\gamma_k \\leq \\kappa \\leq 1$ (for small enough $\\kappa$). Then, we would divide our time period into the intervals $[0,t_M]$ and $[t_M, T-\\delta]$ and treat them separately. The interval $[0,t_M]$ is a subset of $[0,T-1]$ and so could be treated exactly as before. We would treat $[t_M, T-\\delta]$ the same way as $[T-1, T-\\delta]$ with the only change being that for $t \\in [t_M, T-\\delta]$ we now have $T-t \\leq 2$ rather than $T-t \\leq 1$ and so we would end up with different constant factors in our upper and lower bounds on $\\sigma_{T-s}^2$ and $\\gamma_k \\sigma_{T-t_k}^{-4}$. These different constant factors do not affect the overall result.\n\n6. We will include a definition in the camera-ready version.\n\n7. Intuitively, we see the dimension dependence as arising unavoidably from the use of KL divergence to measure the distance between the true and approximate data distribution. Even if the problem factorizes completely, so that it can essentially be viewed as a product of independent 1-dimensional approximation problems, the fact that the KL divergence tensorizes across dimensions means that the error will still scale linearly in the dimension. We considered trying to formalize a lower bound on the iteration complexity in terms of $d$ and the other problem parameters. However, we came to the conclusion that it would be challenging to supply a lower bound that had realistic dependence on both the data dimension and the step size, since the two appear to somewhat trade off against each other for reasons discussed in Section 4. Getting more precise about exactly how the dependence on the dimension and the step size trade off would likely require a much more thorough theoretical investigation."

This paper seeks to prove mixing bounds for the reverse diffusion process after the denoising score model has been learned. In particular, under the assumptions of a learned score function with an L2 error bound and a data distribution with identity covariance, the authors use the theory of stochastic localization to yield a bound on the KL divergence between the generated samples and the data distribution. This bound those that the number of iterates to reach error $\\epsilon$ scales linearly in $d$, quadratically in the forward time $T$, and $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ with respect to $\\epsilon$."

Lemma 1 thus allows us to control the Jacobian of the score function, which in turn allows us to control time-discretization terms of the form $E_{s,t} := \\mathbb{E}[||\\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2]$ via Ito calculus (see Lemmas 2 and 3).\n\nLemma 1 could be proved without reference to stochastic localization. The proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 boil down to standard applications of Ito calculus, and these could be rephrased entirely in the language of diffusion models. However, we choose to present Lemma 1 in the context of stochastic localization in order to provide due credit, since this was the context in which we discovered these ideas, and because we feel that the relationship to stochastic localization provides additional intuition and motivation for our proofs. We will include some more discussion of Lemma 1 after the statement in the camera-ready version (see also our reply to Reviewer wcsw)."

In particular, it seems that the work on the discretization error is new, so the authors are then able to apply the bound from stochastic localization.\n\nWe apologize for the lack of clarity surrounding this overarching structure in the original manuscript. We will provide an updated manuscript by tomorrow with a clearer roadmap at the start of Section 3 explaining which sections of our work are novel. We will also slightly modify the structure of Section 3 to make it easier to get an overview of the proof at a glance, including adding in lemmas summarising the key results of the sections on the bound on the discretization error and the application of Girsanov's theorem.\n\nWith the updated structure, our proof comes in three key steps. We view Step 1 as our main novel contribution, while Steps 2 and 3 closely follow Chen et al. (2023a;d).\n\n**Step 1:** We bound the error from discretizing the reverse SDE. Previous works bound $E_{s,t} := \\mathbb{E}[||\\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2]$ using a Lipschitz assumption. We use a new Ito calculus argument to get a differential inequality for $E_{s,t}$ (Lemmas 2 and 3), relate the coefficients of this inequality to $\\mathbf{m}_t$ and $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}_t$ using known results (Lemma 4), and bound the differential inequality coefficients using our key Lemma 1 (resulting in Lemmas 5 and 6).\n\n**Step 2:** We bound the KL distance between the path measures of the true and approximate reverse process. We use an analogous Girsanov-based method to Chen et al. (2023a;d).\n\n**Step 3:** We use the data processing inequality to bound $\\textup{KL}(q_{\\delta}||p_{t_N})$ in terms of the distance between reverse path measures and the distance between $q_T$ and $\\pi_d$. We bound the former using Step 2 and the latter using the convergence of the OU process (Proposition 4), as in Chen et al. (2023a;d).\n\n> However, is the perspective taken where they view the single process as solutions to (2) and (4) under different measures new?\n\nNo, this is also done in Chen et al. (2023a;d). We will make this clear in our updated introduction to Section 3.\n\n> The biggest issue, though, in my opinion, is that much of the proof is left to the appendix. I understand this is necessary, but without more interpretation in the paper to help the reader understand what is happening, it is easy to get lost. Improving this explanation would greatly help the paper since it is primarily theoretical. Some suggestions are the following...\n\nHopefully, our improved introduction to Section 3 will help to mitigate any lack of clarity caused by the fact that some technical details must inevitably be left to the appendix. In particular, we have taken on board the reviewer's helpful suggestions to pull out the key results from the sections on the bound on the discretization error and the application of Girsanov's theorems, and will use these to add more context to the proofs.\n\n> While the linear dependence in the dimension is expected in the worst case, does the analysis of this paper and similar ones point toward dimension-independent rates under further assumptions on the score? Or is this a limitation of the Langevin diffusion? Could other processes help to alleviate this?\n\nEven for smooth data distributions such as Gaussians, we expect that the convergence rate measured in KL divergence will depend linearly on the data dimension. This is unavoidable since the KL divergence tensorizes over independent dimensions, so we will inevitably pick up a linear scaling in $d$ in the time-discretization error (unless the error is precisely zero, which will not happen if we include some time-discretization). Even the Langevin diffusion with respect to a strongly log-concave distribution (or more generally a distribution satisfying a log-Sobolev inequality) will pick-up a linear dimension dependence once discretised."

Usually, score approximations would be found with deep neural networks. \n\nPrevious results by other authors obtained bounds relating the quality of score approximations to the distance between $q_0$ and the distribution output by the diffusion model. The present paper gives improved bounds: the main difference is that the error in approximating scores is not multiplied by any time- or -dimension dependent factors, but only by a universal constant.   The proof of this result follows the outline of previous work by Chen, Lee and Lu; the main modification (according to the authors) is in dealing with discretization errors.is"

Regarding the novelty of our work, we have provided a detailed discussion explaining which parts of our work are novel and which are related to the previous literature in response to Reviewer TDrD below.\n\n> Can you give me a better sense on where the restrictions on the discretization come from?\n\nOur intuition for the condition on the step sizes is as follows. Consider a diffusion model with an OU noising process where the data distribution is a point mass at the origin and we have learned to perfectly approximate the scores of the marginal distributions. Then, it can be shown that the KL distance between the true and approximate reverse path measures will be (roughly) $\\sum_k \\gamma_k^2/ (T-t_{k+1})^2$, assuming we initialize the reverse process at $q_T$. Hence, we should choose our discretization scheme to ensure that this quantity is as small as possible. One intuitive way to make this quantity reasonably small is to make all of the ratios $\\gamma_k/ (T-t_{k+1})$ equal to some constant $\\kappa$, and then choose the smallest $\\kappa$ such that this is possible. This will force the step sizes to decay exponentially as we approach the starting time.\n\nThe condition $\\gamma_k \\leq \\kappa(T-t_{k+1})$ can then be thought of as forcing at least exponential decay in the step sizes near the original starting time. Note that smaller step sizes nearer the starting time are beneficial, because for non-smooth data distributions the scores will explode as $t \\rightarrow 0$ and so we should take smaller step sizes to compensate for the decreased regularity. The condition $\\gamma_k \\leq \\kappa$ is included to ensure that in addition to decaying exponentially, the step sizes also all uniformly converge to zero at a rate controlled by $\\kappa$."

For instance those found in later work by Chen et al. [1]\n\nFirst, we note that our results should apply directly to any case where the drift term of the noising SDE is replaced by some linear function of $X_t$; this is since the resulting noising process can be transformed into an OU process via a combination of a linear transformation and rescaling the time variable. Consequently, an analogous version of Theorem 1 will hold in these cases. In particular, this means that our results also hold for the variance-exploding SDE, as described in Song et al. (2021b). We will add a remark to this effect in the camera-ready version.\n\nFor more general noising SDEs of the type described in Chen et al. [1], our proof methods would need significant adaptation. This is because the linearity of the SDE is integral to Lemma 1 and therefore to our derivation of Lemma 5. However, if one could derive a result analogous to Lemma 5 in the more general case then this may be sufficient; the form that would be required for the rest of our argument to go through is, roughly, that $E_Q [||\\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2]$ and  $E_Q [|| \\nabla^2 \\log q_{T-t} (Y_t) ||^2]$ should both be bounded by terms of the form $A(t) + \\frac{\\textup{d}}{\\textup{d} t} B(t)$ where $A(t) \\lesssim d \\sigma_{T-t}^{-4}$ and $B(t) \\lesssim d \\sigma_{T-t}^{-2}$. It may be possible to derive such a bound by assuming, for example, a linear upper bound on the drift coefficient and a lower bound on the diffusion coefficient, and using a comparison method with a linear SDE. However we have not explored these details further, as doing so would likely require significant additional technical work beyond the scope of the current paper.\n\nIn addition, in practice non-linear SDEs are rarely used as noising processes, since the linear structure in the SDE greatly simplifies training procedures. Therefore, we have chosen to focus on linear noising SDEs in the current work.\n\nWe will also incorporate the minor comments on the definition of the Frobenius norm and the statement of Girsanov's theorem in the camera-ready version."

The central novelty of the paper's analysis is the incorporation of the decay of the expected covariance of the denoising posterior measure during the process of the sampling. The rate of the decay is obtained through results in the stochastic localization literature, which is subsequently combined with the existing analysis based on Girsanov's theorem. The analysis leads to an improved dependence of the iteration-complexity on the input dimension in the absence of a uniform-Lipschitz assumption on the score function."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful remarks and suggestions.\n\n> Majority of the proof closely follows the analysis of Chen et al. (2023a;d).\n\nWe agree that the structure of our proof closely resembles that of Chen et al. (2023a;d). We see our main contribution as being a more refined treatment of the time-discretization component of their bounds, and the relationship between this treatment and the stochastic localization literature. We are planning to update the introduction to Section 3 with a more thorough overview of which parts of our work are novel and which parts follow previous results; see our response to reviewer TDrD below for more details.\n\n> However, more explanation is required to understand why Lipschitzness is a limiting assumption. For instance, while for discrete measures it is apparent that one must resort to early stopping on a corrupted version of the distribution, it requires further justification for measures absolutely continuous w.r.t the Lebesgue measure.\n\nTo clarify, our motivation for wishing to remove the Lipschitz assumption is two-fold. Firstly, as the reviewer comments, this assumption is inappropriate for discrete measures, but also for measures which are supported on a sub-manifold of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. We expect that many data distributions of interest will be of this form.\n\nSecondly, even if the score of the data distribution is Lipschitz, the Lipschitz constant will be very large when $t \\rightarrow 0$ for many data distributions (e.g. those approximately supported on a sub-manifold). Crucially, in many cases we expect that the Lipschitz constant will scale with the data dimension (as is seen, for example, in Chen et al. (2023a), where they use early stopping to ensure that the scores of the marginal distributions are uniformly Lipschitz, but in doing so pick up an extra $d$ dependence in the Lipschitz constant). As such, previous assumptions of a uniform-in-time Lipschitz constant can hide the full dimension dependence. We therefore consider them misleading in many practical cases, even if the data distribution is smooth. As this intuition is a key part of the motivation for our work, we thank the reviewer for highlighting it and will clarify the presentation in the camera-ready version.\n\n> Assumption 1 of approximating the score to arbitrary error, while utilized in existing works, is unrealistic for several setups.\n\nWe agree that Assumption 1 has some important limitations. On the one hand, there are limitations on the estimation of the score function, as highlighted by the reviewer. In addition, while the results in our paper would suggest that the convergence rate of the diffusion model is determined by the error in the discretization of the reverse process, we find in practice that the score-approximation error $\\varepsilon_{\\textup{score}}^2$ is the dominant term in the bound of Theorem 1. Therefore, Assumption 1, which states that we may learn the score to within an arbitrary approximation error $\\varepsilon_{\\textup{score}}^2$, may be inappropriate in practice. We will include an additional mention of these limitations in the camera-ready version of our work.\n\nNevertheless, Assumption 1 is the standard assumption on the error of the score approximation used in the rest of the literature on the convergence of diffusion models. We therefore choose to focus on it in our work. A more detailed analysis of its appropriateness would be somewhat orthogonal to the main thrust of the present work.\n\n> For what classes of distributions is the uniform Lipshitzness assumption restrictive? What iteration complexity could one expect under smoothness assumptions non-uniform in time?\n\nHopefully, our response above clarifies that the uniform Lipschitzness assumption is restrictive for data supported on a sub-manifold, and also may hide sub-optimal dependence on the data dimension in many additional cases -- for example, any case where the Lipschitz constant implicitly scales with the data dimension, which may occur if the data distribution is approximately distributed on a sub-manifold. Using a Lipschitz constant which varies in time will not automatically avoid these problems; indeed, the work of Chen et al. (2023a) only assumes Lipschitz smoothness at $t=0$, but still obtains quadratic dependence in the data dimension. Fundamentally, it seems to us that any proof method which aims to control a quantity of the form $E_{s,t} := \\mathbb{E}[||\\nabla \\log q_{T-t}(Y_t) - \\nabla \\log q_{T-s}(Y_s)||^2]$ using Lipschitzness of the scores - i.e. a supremum bound - rather than working in expectation will pick up an extra factor of $d$ and so be suboptimal compared to the results in our work."

Can this be interpreted as establishing an average-Lipschitzness of the score function?\n\nYes; the operator norm of the Jacobian of the score can be thought of as a \"local Lipschitz constant\" of the score function. Hence Lemma 5, which controls the expected Frobenius norm of the Jacobian, can be thought of as controlling the \"expected local Lipschitzness\" of the score (up to the equivalence of the Frobenius and operator norms).\n\n> Are deterministic sampling schemes expected to yield identical iteration complexities?\n\nWe expect that deterministic sampling schemes will still have a linear dependence on the data dimension (as our example in Appendix G will continue to apply in this setting). However, we expect deterministic sampling schemes to generally have a better dependence on the step size. This is seen, for example, in this paper by Li et al. (2023): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09251.pdf. However, convergence results for deterministic sampling typically require either additional smoothness assumptions on the data distribution (see e.g. Benton et al. (2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16860), or a small amount of stochasticity in the sampling scheme in order to smooth the reverse process (see e.g. Chen et al. (2023c) https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11798, or Albergo et al. (2023) https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08797).\n\nWe also thank the reviewer for their additional suggestions. We will update the title of our work to ``Nearly $d$-Linear Convergence Bounds for Diffusion Models via Stochastic Localization'' and include their suggested changes on Equations 5,6 and the comment on the posterior means in the camera-ready version."
