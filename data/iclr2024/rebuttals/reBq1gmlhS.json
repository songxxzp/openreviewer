It would be better if the authors could highlight their technical contributions.\"\n\nThe main technical contribution is that standard objective perturbation (as used in Algorithm 1) requires strong-convexity of the original loss in order to achieve the best possible rates for DP. In our case, the loss is not in fact strongly convex in the standard sense (i.e. with respect to the $\\ell_2$-norm, but rather is strongly convex with respect to a data-dependent norm. This makes it completely unclear if there are instantiations of these DP algorithms, that when combined will achieve DP with the same statistical rates of the non-private algorithms. Our main contribution is in showing that this is indeed possible, which requires a somewhat delicate analysis of how these different DP methods interact with strong-convexity with respect to a dataset-dependent norm.\n\n> \"2. The sub-optimality bound has dependence $\\tilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{n\\epsilon })$, where the dependence is not optimal and the second term could dominate if $\\epsilon$ goes to 0.

In addition, [3] shows that the additional cost due to DP could be of $\\tilde{O}(1/n\\epsilon)$\n for offline RL tasks. What is the challenge to derive such dependence?\n\nThe additional cost of DP from [3] in the linear function approximation case includes an explicit dependence on $\\frac{1}{\\kappa}$, where $\\kappa$ is the minimum eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix (analogous to our $\\Sigma_D$). In contrast our work, precisely as in Zhu et al. (2023), requires no assumption on the eigenvalues of $\\Sigma_D$, and indeed still holds when some eigenvalues are zero. This is the main source of the difference in bounds achieved in our case versus the offline RL setting of [3].\n\n\n> \"For the MDP setting, the reward for a whole trajectory is still a linear function of $\\theta$. Given that the occupancy measure $\\rho$\n is an input of Algorithm 3, is this setting identical to the contextual bandit setting?\"\n\n The settings are similar but not quite identical. In particular, the loss on line 1 of Algorithm 3 needs to be modified to be:\n\n$$ \\hat{J}(\\pi) = \\min_{\\theta\\in\\Theta(\\tilde{\\theta},\\lambda)} \\mathbb E_{s\\sim\\rho_{\\pi}}[\\langle\\theta,\\phi(s,\\pi(s))-v\\rangle]$$\nwhere $\\rho_{\\pi}$ is the occupancy measure induced by the policy $\\pi$. That is, the expectation defining the loss is now over a policy-dependent distribution, rather than a fixed distribution as in the bandit case."

In RLHF, humans provide rankings for multiple (state, action) pairs (in LLM applications, (prompt, text) pairs) to train a reward model, which is used for downstream reinforcement learning tasks. This paper tries to study how to train the reward model while ensuring DP on the ranking dataset. To do this, this paper takes the theoretical model of [Zhu et al, 2023], which assumes that humans have real numerical preferences for (state, action) pair in a linear form $r_{\\theta^*}(s, a) = \\langle \\theta^*, \\phi(s, a)\\rangle$ and sample rankings according to some classical probability models based on the numerical preferences (Bradley-Terry-Luce, Plackett-Luce). So, the central task is to learn the parameter $\\theta^*$ differentially privately. The paper shows that this can be done by standard DP techniques. Also, the paper shows that the downstream reinforcement learning performance using a reward model with the DP-learned parameter is similar to that of the non-DP learned parameter."

I know that this is a theoretical paper, but I do think experimental results are necessary here, for the following reasons: The purpose of introducing differential privacy to RLHF is to protect the privacy of the human data providers __in practice__. This paper's theoretical results provide upper bounds on privacy loss and the learning performance loss due to privacy guarantee, _under an idealized model_ ([Zhu et al, 2023]'s model). Humans' ranking behavior may not follow that idealized model, and the RLHF algorithms (for both the reward training and the downstream RL) used in practice are not necessarily the algorithms analyzed in this paper. Whether the theoretical results in this paper can be applied is questionable. Given that the theoretical contribution of this paper is only marginal (see below), I think an empirical contribution (trying DP on real datasets with real RLHF algorithms) is needed here.\n\n(2) My second concern is that the technical contribution of this paper is marginal. The DP technique (adding Gaussian noises to the loss function and the solution in a convex optimization) is a standard technique from [Bassily et al, 2019a] and [Kifer et al, 2012]. The linear reward + BTL/PL model is the same as [Zhu et al, 2023]. The proofs of the theorems are basically a combination of the proofs from these two lines of previous work.\n\nDue to the above two concerns I recommend weak reject."

                        "value": "> \"(1) How does [Zhu et al, 2023]'s idealized model capture real-world RLHF algorithms?\"\n\nOne main way in which [Zhu et al, 2023]'s model captures real-world issues is in the necessity of using pessimistic policy optimization in the RLHF setting. That is, they show that one gets asymptotically worse convergence rates using standard policy optimization. Real-world RLHF algorithms generally include a KL-divergence regularizer designed to ensure that the learned policy does not deviate too far from the original LLM, which can be seen as a form of pessimism in policy optimization.\n\n> \"(2) How does adding DP to their model really inform RLHF in practice?\"\n\nThe high-level takeaway of our DP results for practical RLHF is that one can maintain privacy without asymptotically affecting the amount of data that needs to be collected for RLHF to succeed. This sets a target for practical research, by demonstrating that in the theoretical setting where provable statistical gaurantees are possible, privacy for RLHF comes at no additional cost."

In this work, the authors assert that the sub-optimality gap is near-optimal.

In addressing the general Markov Decision Process (MDP) setting, the author exclusively focuses on estimating the reward function and undertaking pessimistic policy optimization. However, a fundamental challenge in learning an MDP lies in acquiring knowledge about the transition probability function  $P$. The determination of the occupancy $\\rho$ for a given policy $\\pi$ remains unclear. The assumption appears to presume that the transition process is already known, effectively simplifying the MDP problem to a bandit problem and streamlining the learning process. It is imperative to explicitly state all assumptions before making any claims.\n\n4. The proposed algorithm lacks experimental results to substantiate its efficacy."

To briefly highlight the differences with our work, note that in the RLHF setting the goal is to learn a reward function, and then train a policy using the learned reward. In contrast, the papers [1] and [2] both achieve differential privacy in standard reinforcement learning settings, where a reward function is already given as part of the interaction with the MDP. The difference in settings is significant even without differential privacy, and different algorithmic choices are required (e.g. optimistic algorithms in standard MDPs, vs pessimistic policy optimization needed for RLHF)."
