It is nearly impossible to track all new works on arXiv because of the tremendous amount of papers posted on arXiv. \n\nSecond, the goal of our work is different from [1]. [1] aims to demonstrate that the proposed positional encoding together with global self-attention is endowed with stronger expressiveness compared to the 1-WL algorithm. \n\nIn contrast, our work aims to illustrate that the adjacency function of various GNNs (e.g., MPNNs, graph transformers, etc.) is the dominant component in the expressiveness of modeling graph-structure, demonstrated with color refinement algorithms, while the feature-conditioning counterpart in self-attention (i.e., attention scores based on features similarity) is not the key factor."

More formal connection can make me understand better.\n\nA: Understanding the \"bottleneck\" of GNNs has been extensively studied and is known to be a critical factor affecting the performance of graph models [2]. In such models, bottlenecking refers to a situation where a small number of edges or vertices significantly restrict the flow or connectivity of information propagated by GNNs between two nodes. \nThe authors' proposal in [2] to use Ollivier-Ricci (OR) curvature as a means to quantify this phenomenon has been a significant advancement in understanding graph structures. \nDue to the limitation of OR, they utilize OR on the input graphs which are unweighted and undirected to study the bottleneck of MPNNs.\nHowever, when the scope goes broader to various GNNs (e.g., MPNNs, graph rewiring, graph transformers), it is insufficient. Different GNNs behave differently given the same input graphs. \nTherefore, we propose a unified framework, GPNN, for various GNNs. Theoretically and empirically, we demonstrate that various GNNs can be viewed as generalized propagations with learned or fixed propagation matrices. Thus, we can study the bottleneck on GNNs directly via the corresponding propagation matrices instead of on the input graphs.\nHowever, the propagation graphs are naturally weighted-directed (for example, the learned attention matrices), where the OR is not applicable.\nThis drives us to extend the OR to weighted-directed graphs, termed the CURC (Curvature Under Ricci Curvature), to become a valuable tool for studying the bottleneck of graph transformers."

How to use these theories to guide the design of GNN ?\n\nA: We would strongly argue that the definition and properties of CURC are not trivial. Even though curvatures have been utilized to analyze the bottleneck of MPNNs (Topping et al, ICML 2022). However, it is limited on analyzing the input graphs, which need to be simple graphs (i.e., undirected without self-loop) due to the property of curvature (only applicable the symmetric graphs). Considering the behaviors of various GNNs (e.g., MPNNs, graph rewiring, graph transformers, etc.) are not strictly tied to the input graphs: MPNNs and graph transformers, as examples, show different behaviors given the same input graphs. \nTo better analyze various GNNs, we propose the unified framework, GPNN, which accommodates various GNNs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dominant component in GPNN to the expressiveness is the adjacency functions, which allow us to analyze the expressiveness of various GNNs in a unified approach, ridding of the less relevant parts.\nHowever, the propagation graphs from adjacency functions are naturally weighted and directed (e.g., attention matrices are asymmetric). To better understand the bottleneck of various GNNs under the GPNN framework, we carefully extend the definition of Ricci-curvature to weighted directed graphs without breaking the desired properties of curvature. \n\nThe proposed tools, CURC and GPNN framework, are beneficial to the graph research community, for better understanding the behaviors of GNNs and guiding the future design of GNNs. Open questions can be studied with CURC and GPNN including but limited to: 1. whether the larger average curvatures of the propagation graphs are beneficial for GNNs to learn graphs? 2. do negative curvatures for node pairs contain important information on modeling graph structure?"

By configuring the adjacency function f and entry-wise function \\pi, various GNNs (MPNNs, graph rewiring and GTs) can be unified into a general framework, generalized propagation networks (GPNNs). And the authors show that the expressiveness of models within GPNN framework sorely depends on the adjacency function f. Therefore, novel GNN models with diverse expressive power can be constructed by designing appropriate adjacency functions. Extensive experiments are conducted on several public datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model."

In general, the goal of Table 2 and Table 3 is to justify our hypothesis that the adjacency function is the essential component of the expressiveness of GNNs,  while the _feature conditioning_ property in self-attention, which is considered crucial in other domains, is just the icing on the cake with respect to the expressiveness in graph transformers. The hypothesis is verified by the observation that GPNN-PE without feature conditioning outperforms previous graph transformers with different adjacency functions and only slightly underperforms the graph transformer with the same adjacency function, GRIT."

Therefore, we mainly focus on benchmarks widely utilized in evaluating the expressiveness of graph transformers in previous works (Kreuzer et al., NeurIPS 2021; Rampasek et al., NeurIPS 2022; Ma et al., ICML 2023).\nThus, we would argue that addressing the scalability limitation of graph transformers is not the duty of this paper.\n\nIn addition, the suggested node-level benchmarks (e.g., Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed) are generally not suitable for evaluating the expressiveness of GNNs: even simple GNNs like GCNs, GATs are prone to overfitting, which obfuscates the understanding of expressiveness with the overfitting issue due to the limited amount of training data."

They show that expressiveness of the model depends only on the function of its adjacency and they empirically test this by removing self-attention (i.e. the entry-wise function) from one of the GT models  and still retaining its performance (prior to its modification). The authors also extend Ollivier-Ricci (OR) curvature to weighted directed graphs, thus defining Continuous Unified Ricci Curvature (CURC). They study the theoretical properties of CURC and leverage this in analyzing the shifts in curvature distribution for propagation graphs after training, for a number of graph learning models that can be cast as GPNNs."

Firstly, we would like to maintain matrix notation to shorten the expression of $\\rho$ $f$ and $\\phi$ in eq. 23-29 (appendix D). With a matrix notation, those expressions can be significantly shorter than their entry-wise counterparts. Secondly, the GPNN framework started from the idea of separating the entry-wise function $\\pi$ with adjacent function $f$. Thus, we would like to embed the restriction of \"entry-wise\" in the notation of $\\pi$ to make sure the theory would hold with various GNNs that are able to be cast as GPNNs. Thus, from our point of view, it is unavoidable to use an entry-wise notation for $\\pi$ in eq. 2, but keep matrix notation for the others. $P$ matrix and $P_{u,v}$ entry is the variable that connects the entry-wise notion and matrix notion.\n\n\n> (W1 b) providing standard names to symbols so that referring to them is straightforward (e.g.\u00a0$\\rho$()\u00a0is referred to as both \"normalized function\" and \"normalized propagation\" which may be confusing,\u00a0\u00a0does not have a descriptive name)\n\nA: We thank the reviewer for the very detailed example of the name ambiguity that appears. From our inspection, we found the specific case the reviewer mentioned is in Sec 3.2:\n\n**\"normalized function\"** -- \"And $\\rho$, which represents the normalized function.\"\n**\"normalized propagation\"** -- \"where $\\times$ denotes the matrix multiplication between normalized propagation $\\rho(P)$ and $\\phi(X)$\".\n\nAs stated in the former sentence, $\\rho$ is referred to as a normalized function. In the second, we are referring to the matrix output of $\\rho(P)$ as normalized propagation. Thus, there is actually no two-name issue associated with the same function. We will include extra clarification to reduce the ambiguity it might cause.\n\n> (W1 c) Consider using a simple model as GNN as an example of the choices for the functions \"embedded\" within the text (rather than only as part of Table 1)\n\nA: We would like to direct the reviewer to Appendix D, where we demonstrate how to cast various existing MPNNs/GTs/Rewirings into our framework. The model which we included is various: \n**MPNNs** -- GCN, GAT, GatedGCN\n**GTs** -- Graphormer, GRIT, SAN, GraphGPS\n**Rewiring** -- DREW\nWe have included an extra paragraph in Sec 3.2 to emphasize the importance of those examples and encourage the readers towards Appendix D."

Illustrating CURC on a **small simple example graph** is possible, however, picking the specific graph would highly depend on what properties of CURC one would like to show. However, contrasting **OR** could be difficult since OR can only be applied on unweighted-undirected graphs while CURC is extended from OR to cover weighted digraphs. Thus CURC is equivalent to OR where OR is applicable. Given those difficulties, in the paper, we took another approach in **Figure 1**, where we demonstrate **CURC-curvature** (with top-10/20/30% Attention) on **a ZINC graph** with practical model (GPNN-PE). Such visualization concentrates more on the exact application of CURC is considered in this work: to analyze the information flow in a learned propagation graph. We will include a simple example graph in the appendix to show CURC's properties."

There are various adjacency function designs exist in the literature (See Appendix D). In general, most of the positional/structrual encoding and rewiring procedures, which brought huge improvements empirically, are an instantiation of adjacency functions. Previously, those are regarded as different directions of research. In this work, a general framework is proposed to setup a unified view on thoes encodings/procedure which brings extra expressiveness beyond 1-WL."

How could this reconcile with the reported elevated efficacy of GTs ... any other potential empirical factors ...\n\nA: The reported elevated efficacy of GTs has also been questioned by [1] and [2]. Those papers raised two observations: 1. the globality of self-attention is more important than the feature-conditioning counterpart (query-key feature similarity). 2. The performance gain of GTs highly depends on positional encodings. Our theoretical framework and empirical result explain their findings while providing a deeper understanding of the elevated efficacy of GTs. \nHere we summarize our empirical findings: removing QK attention would not affect the performance of GTs but changing adjacent functions affect the performance a lot. In detail -- Table. 3, concise with theoretical finding, shows GPNN-PE (a GNN with non-feature-conditioning global filters based on a properly designed adjacency function) outperforms most previous GTs with global self-attention and only slightly underperform the SOTA GTs (GRIT) with the same adjacency function.\n\n**Thank you once more for your valuable and detailed feedback, which has significantly enhanced the work. The authors are committed to revising their paper, incorporating the recommended plots, and diligently addressing the highlighted issues and shortcomings. Upon your assessment that we have adequately resolved the identified concerns, we would appreciate your consideration of a re-evaluation of our work.

The paper explored the expressiveness of GPNN, and an upper bound was proved. Plus, the paper defined CURC (continuous unified Ricci curvature) and utilized it to explore expressive power.

But CURC is based on an asymmetric metric function (which is not a metric), which means the metric could be different from u to v or v to u, which in turn means that the curvature from u to v could be more curved or less curved than the reverse.

The $f$ function in Appendix A1 is not the adjacency function. However, they share the same notion $f$ due to the adjacency function being permutation equivariant. \n\n**why not restricting Appendix A1 the same as the Adjacency function?** We choose to introduce permutation equivariance by defining its most general form, which is between two \"arbitrary order\" tensor power spaces. This is because a strong adjacency function could be realized/implemented by stacking mappings between such higher-order tensor power space. In fact, such implementation is proved to be crucial and unavoidable as showed in Equivaraint GNN [1] (Haggai) [Theorem 1] that a stronger expressiveness (k-FWL) needs at least R^(n^k) \u201cintermediate variable\u201d during the computation.  Since we are targeting to provide a general framework and considering the additional content of CURC, such an indication remains implicit due to the content limit. We thank the reviewers\u2019 comments and include an extra section in the Appendix to discuss the designing space of the permutation equivariant adjacency function."

In geometry, Ricci curvature is a degrade of Riemann curvature, while it is enough to characterize two-dimensional manifolds.\n\nA: This comment is regarding towards **our choice of Ricci curvature**, in the context of exploring graphs in our paper. Your observation about the role of Ricci curvature in geometry is indeed accurate. Ricci curvature, derived from the more general Riemann curvature tensor, is crucial in the characterization of two-dimensional manifolds. However, our paper's focus extends beyond the traditional geometric interpretation of Ricci curvature to its application in graph analysis, particularly within the framework of Graph Transformers.\n\nIn our study, we build upon existing research that employs Ollivier-Ricci curvature for analyzing graphs [2]. The choice of Ollivier-Ricci curvature is motivated by its ability to capture the geometric properties of a graph in a way that is particularly relevant to our analysis of Graph Transformers. Specifically, CURC extends the application of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to weighted directed graphs (digraphs), which are representative of the propagation graphs defined in our GPNN framework, unifying various GNNs (e.g., MPNNs, graph rewiring, graph transformers).\nThe extension to weighted digraphs is not trivial because it allows for a more nuanced understanding of how GNNs behave via propagation graphs rather than on the property of input graphs, \nwhere the directionality and weights of edges play a critical role. This is particularly pertinent in the context of Graph Transformers, where the learned propagation graphs can differ from the input graphs remarkably.\n\nWe believe this extension not only enriches the theoretical understanding of graph curvature in the realm of machine learning and graph neural networks but also provides practical benefits in terms of enhanced model interpretability and performance."

As outlined in Definition 4, $m$ is indeed a mapping from the vertex set $V$ to the interval $(0,1]$. This mapping places $m$ in the space $R^{(0, 1] \\times |V|}$, considering the discrete nature of the vertex set. \n\nThe normalized left eigenvector, which we refer to in our paper, resides within this space. Therefore, when we mention $ m(x) $, we are specifically referring to the x-th value of this eigenvector, denoted as $ (\\frac{v\\_{pf}}{||v\\_{pf}||})\\_x $. This notation represents the x-th component of the eigenvector $ v_{pf} $ normalized by its norm $ ||v_{pf}|| $. \n\nWhen discussing $ m(x) $ divided by $ m(y) $, we are comparing these specific components of the normalized eigenvector, which correspond to different vertices in the graph respectively. This comparison is crucial for the analysis presented in section 7 and Lemma B7, as it relates to the behavior of the network at different vertices."

How they relates to bottlenecking within weighted-directed graphs? any section it refers to?\n\nA: The notion of a \"bottleneck\" in undirected graphs has been extensively studied and is known to be a critical factor affecting the performance of graph models [2]. In such models, bottlenecking refers to a situation where a small number of edges or vertices significantly restrict the flow or connectivity within the network. The authors' proposal in [2] to use Ollivier-Ricci (OR) curvature on input graphs as a means to quantify this phenomenon has been a significant advancement in understanding graph structures. \nWhen we extend the concept of bottlenecking to weighted-directed graphs, the CURC (Curvature Under Ricci Curvature) becomes a valuable tool. \nThis is driven by the fact that different GNNs (e.g., MPNNs, graph rewiring, graph transformers) behave differently given the same input graphs. \nAlternatively, we propose to analyze the propagation graphs of various GNNs under the GPNN framework, which are naturally weighted-directed graphs and not compatible to OR curvature.\nIn this context, CURC's extension to OR curvature allows for a nuanced understanding of bottleneck phenomena in the propagation graphs. This generalization is crucial as it adapts the concept of bottlenecks, traditionally applied to undirected graphs, to the realm of weighted-directed graphs, thereby providing deeper insights into the bottleneck of GNNs. We will include a more throughout discussion on this topic in the appendix\n\n**The authors hope this clarification addresses the reviewer's query and highlights the novelty and significance of their approach in integrating geometric concepts with advanced graph analytical methods.**\n\n\n\n[1] Maron, H., Ben-Hamu, H., Serviansky, H., & Lipman, Y.
