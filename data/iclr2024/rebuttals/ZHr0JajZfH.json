In Section 4.3, the paper claims that the OOD state-actions can harm the performance of online fine-tuning. Wouldn\u2019t the collected online data, that contain reward signals, enhance the data support of the offline dataset? \n\n- There is a lack of clear explanation towards the unique challenges in the exploration-exploitation of the offline-to-online problem. For instance, a major issue could be the \u201cforgetting\u201d - during the model updates  the fine-tuned policy can quickly forget what it has learned from offline, which is neglected by this work.\n\n- The motivation and evaluation are isolated. In the Introduction, the paper claims \u201cthe proposed method provides a generic solution for offline-to-online RL to enable finetuning agents pretrained with different offline RL objectives.\u201d However, in the experiment, the tuning policy is pretrained from the same task."

                        "value": "Many thanks to Reviewer MwS2 for providing the detailed and valuable review, and we respond to the weaknesses and questions as below.\n\n> **Q1: Definition of uncertainty.**\n\nIn this work, we define the uncertainty as the approximate negative log likelihood of the state-action density as shown in Page 4:\n$\\mathcal{U}(s,a)\\overset{\\rm{def}}{=}-\\log p(s,a)\\approx\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{ELBO}}(s,a;\\psi,\\varphi).$\n\n> **Q2: Advantage of VAE over ensemble-based technique for uncertainty quantification.**\n\nWe detail the reasons at the beginning of Section 4.1 as below.\n\n> Many prior works typically utilize Q ensembles to qualify uncertainty. However, the ensemble technique may significantly increase computational costs. Thus, in this work, we utilize a simple yet effective approach by adopting VAE  as a state-action visitation density estimator for uncertainty quantification.\n\nFurthermore, we also derive some initial empirical results on the ensemble setting in Table 9 in the appendix. From Table 9, we can observe that uncertainty quantification with VAE can attain comparable performance to using the variance of 10 Q functions, where the latter would significantly increase computational costs.\n\n> **Q3: Enhance data support of the offline dataset through online interaction.**\n\nYes, the collected online data can enhanced the data support of the offline dataset. However, we aim at 100k environment step setting in this work, which requires extremely high sample efficiency. Therefore, although the policy can automatically recover the extrapolation error brought by OOD state-actions via trial-and-error, it leads to inferior sample efficiency. Thus, we introduce the adaptive exploitation method with OOD sample identification to overcome this issue.\n\n> **Q4: Explanations on exploration-exploitation issue in offline-to-online RL.**\n\nWe observe that aggressive exploration may exacerbate the distribution shift, while conservative exploitation can hinder agents from efficient online finetuning. Specifically, as stated at the end of Section 4.2, to solve the constrained exploratory behavior issue, we introduce optimistic exploration strategy. However, this may also bring negative effects by further increasing state-action distribution shift, as a result of the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty. Thus, simultaneously and efficiently addressing both challenges brings additional improvement.\n\n> **Q5: \"Forgetting\" issue.**\n\nWe want to clarify that the forgetting issue is one outcome of failing to handle state-action distribution shift. As stated in Introduction, \n\n> Accordingly, the state-action distribution shift between offline and online data occurs, leading to the well-known extrapolation error during exploitation, which may wipe out the good initialization obtained from the pretraining stage.\n\nThus, we solve this issue by proposing the adaptive exploitation method with OOD sample identification.\n\n> **Q6: Evaluation of \"generic\" solution for offline-to-online RL.**\n\nWe want to clarify that the genericness of SUNG means that SUNG can be seamlessly combined with multiple existing offline RL methods. We verify this by combing SUNG with four backbone offline RL methods, including TD3+BC, CQL, CQL-10, and SPOT.\n\n> **Q7: Hyper-parameter Tuning.**\n\nWe want to clarify that we only tune these two hyper-parameters of SUNG in this paper, i.e., finalist action set size k and OOD sample percent p. Actually, SUNG does not require extensive hyper-parameter tuning; instead, it only demands minimal effort in that regard. As demonstrated in Figure 3, SUNG consistently outperforms the best baseline for any choice of k. Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 4, SUNG consistently outperforms the best baseline when p is appropriately set within the range of [5, 10]. Thus, SUNG achieves robust performance without the need for intensive hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which aligns with our initial motivation to develop a simple-yet-effective offline-to-online RL algorithm.\n\nIn terms of other hyper-parameters, we set them with an appropriate value and never tune them out of simplicity. For example, we set N=100 for TD3+BC and CQL, and set them to 20 for CQL-10 to decrease the computational costs. We set alpha=1.0, which is the exactly the default setting without temperature. We set lambda=1.0, which is exactly the default multi-task loss setting. Thus, we also highlight that carefully tuning these hyper-parameters may bring further improvement of SUNG.\n\n> **Q8: Relationship between finetuning method and pretraining algorithm.**\n\nYes, you are right. In this work, we utilize the corresponding online RL objectives for online finetuning to keep consistent.\n\n---\nWe hope that our response could address your concerns and that you would consider increasing your score."

In response to the identified weaknesses and questions, we provide the following clarifications and improvements\n\n> **Q1: Novelty Concern.**\n\nWe want to highlight our novelty from the following aspects.\n\n**Firstly**, we mark that we identify the key question in offline-to-online RL as simultaneously addressing both challenges of constrained exploratory behavior and state-action distribution shift while eliminating the inherent conflict between exploration and exploitation. While prior research has attempted to address each challenge independently, tackling both challenges simultaneously is not a trivial task. For instance, some previous works (e.g., O3F) proposes efficient exploration strategy to mitigate the constrained exploratory behavior. However, we observe their divergence and sub-optimal performance when finetuning CQL agents, precisely due to this inherent conflict. Please refer to Appendix B for detailed analyses. In contrast, SUNG naturally unifies the solutions to both challenges with the tool of uncertainty, achieving the desired trade-off between exploration and exploitation. As a result, when combined with either TD3+BC or CQL, SUNG significantly surpasses previous SOTAs.\n\n**Secondly**, we point out that we develop novel techniques, such as bi-level action selection mechanism and adaptive exploitation with OOD sample identification, enabling SUNG to present a simple-yet-effective manner. Different from previous optimistic exploration techniques, we propose a bi-level action selection mechanism to mitigate the challenges of computation complexity and intensive task-specific hyper-parameter tuning, while achieving efficient exploration. In contrast to previous adaptive exploitation methods, SUNG builds on the insight that offline RL objectives can be typically interpreted as an online RL objective and a regularization term. As such, we develop a novel adaptive exploitation method with OOD sample identification to achieve the desired trade-off between performance and stability. Significantly, SUNG demonstrates robust superiority over previous SOTAs across a diverse set of hyper-parameters, as shown in Figure 3 and 4, which further enhances its practical applicability.\n\n**Thirdly**, we emphasize that we perform systematic empirical evaluations for SUNG. We combine SUNG with 4 backbone offline RL algorithms across 15 settings spanning MuJoCo and AntMaze domains, and we utilize 13 baselines for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that SUNG significantly outperforms previous SOTAs. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies on each component to thoroughly verify the effectiveness of SUNG. Additionally, we also showcase SUNG's seamless integration with other techniques, such as ensemble Q learning and high update-to-data ratios, leading to superior finetuning performance.\n\n**Finally**, we also contribute a series of fresh insights to the offline-to-online setting, e.g., (1) Exploration with high Q-value actions leads to divergence when finetuning CQL, as elaborated in Appendix B. SUNG can stably finetune CQL agents by balancing the trade-off between uncertainty and Q value. (2) Fully online RL objectives fail in challenging sparse-reward tasks, as detailed in Appendix D.1. SUNG can achieve flexible trade-off between offline and online RL objectives, which enables stiching sub-optimal sub-trajectories and overcoming the sparse reward issue.\n\n**Overall**, in this paper, we aim to develop a simple, generic, sample-efficient offline-to-online RL framework as a good starting point for deriving strong empirical performance."

Despite the practical theoretical results achieved by the offline RL community, to the best of my knowledge, there still exists a gap in establishing an initial theoretical foundation for offline-to-online RL. Moreover, given the diversity of theoretical foundations of offline RL algorithms, proposing a single framework considering different theoretical guarantees presents challenges. Therefore, we follow previous works [1-5] to focus on developing empirically effective and robust offline-to-online RL algorithms. From our systematic empirical evaluation on MuJoCo and AntMaze domains, SUNG significantly outperforms the previous SOTAs and does not require intensive hyper-parameter tuning. Moreover, extensive ablation studies on each component also demonstrate the effectiveness of SUNG.\n\n[1] Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning via Balanced Replay and Pessimistic Q-Ensemble, CoRL'22.\n\n[2] Online Decision Transformer, ICML'22.\n\n[3] Policy Expansion for Bridging Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning, ICLR'23.\n\n[4] Adaptive Policy Learning for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning, AAAI'23.\n\n[5] Actor-Critic Alignment for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning, ICML'23.\n\n---\nWe hope that our response could address your concerns and that you would consider increasing your score."

Why does SUNG use Q value for other offline RL methods?\n\nMoreover, SUNG introduces many new hyperparameters to be tuned. However, hyperparameter tuning has proven to be a challenging task in offline or offline-to-online RL.\n\nOverall, SUNG is not an elegant and \"simple\" method.\n\n[1] Zhou, W., Bajracharya, S., & Held, D.

SUNG can achieve flexible trade-off between offline and online RL objectives, which enables stiching sub-optimal sub-trajectories and overcoming the sparse reward issue.\n\n**Overall**, in this paper, we aim to develop a simple, generic, sample-efficient offline-to-online RL framework as a good starting point for deriving strong empirical performance.\n\n> **Q2: Theoretical analysis/insight on bi-level action selection.**\n\nWe want to highlight that the bi-level action selection mechanism is a practical solution for Eq. (7). It overcomes two challenges of solving Eq.(7): the difficulty in finding an optimal solution and the necessity for task-specific hyper-parameter tuning. Although we do not include theoretical insights of it, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimistic exploration strategy."

Similarly, as illustrated in Figure 4, SUNG consistently outperforms the best baseline when p is appropriately set within the range of [5, 10], with the highest D4RL score obtained at p=5. Thus, SUNG achieves robust performance without the need for intensive hyper-parameter fine-tuning, which aligns with our initial motivation to develop a simple-yet-effective offline-to-online RL algorithm. We only tune these two hyper-parameters of SUNG in this paper, i.e., finalist action set size k and OOD sample percent p. \n\n>**Q5: Claim for state distribution shift.**\n\nThanks for pointing out this ambiguity.

                    "value": "The paper proposes a unified methodology for offline to online reinforcement learning based on an out of distribution sample identifying mechanism that employs a variational autoencoder for density estimation and ultimately to quantify uncertainty. The authors propose the SUNG (simple unified uncertainty guided) framework to work on top of most model-free offline RL algorithms & evaluate the approach with CQL & TD3+BC as base algorithms. Since a key limitation when moving from offline to online learning is the conservatism that hinders collection of new data, the algorithm employs the concept of optimism in the face of uncertainty so that the policy should in the online phase choose actions that have both high value and high uncertainty. Since the distribution shift induced by this exploration scheme makes value estimation harder and can hinder learning, an adaptive uncertainty guided exploitation scheme is introduced, which regularizes the policy based on the samples' OOD-ness.\nThe empirical evaluation compares SUNG with two base algorithms against multiple other baselines on D4RL tasks and finds SUNG to outperform prior works substantially."

Selecting actions optimistically in the face of uncertainty seems like a good exploration strategy for O2O, since it's been proven to work in prior works on other exploration tasks. Especially the fact that the method is compatible with many offline RL algorithms that can be used under the hood as base algorithm appears to be a practical advantage."
                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "I find the formulation of the SUNG framework a bit counterintuitive: The authors mention that they want to have high-uncertainty actions, yet at the same time they only sample \"near-on-policy actions for exploration\", which appears contradicting. Further, during the optimization / policy improvement part (green arrows in fig 1), the same percentage p of the batch is always labeled as OOD, which is not consistent, since the absolute uncertainty value at which a sample could be labeled OOD can vary (it could even be the case that the same sample is sometimes OOD and sometimes not, depending on the other samples in the batch).\n\nGenerally, I have a bit of an issue with the additional OOD detection in the adaptive exploitation - the regularizer in offline RL algorithms is mostly already doing OOD detection (often also based on some measure of uncertainty), so it should already automatically detect low and high uncertainty samples and thus assign low or high regularization accordingly. While this is normally not done in such a binary nature, I don't see how the adaptive exploitation scheme is not doing pretty much the same thing again. It seems to just amplify the regularization tendency that is already there. The emperical ablation in fig 2d shows it to be important, but to me it is unclear why that is the case - is the normal regularization simply not yet enough? or is the VAE based OOD detection in some qualitative way better than the base algorithms own regularization?\n\nIn the exploration scheme, where actions are ranked & selected based on value and then sampled based on uncertainty (or the other way around), you mention the possibility to adapt the trade-off preference between value and uncertainty - what do you mean by that? Would you adaptively change the trade-off during the training process or is it something you set in advance (and based on what information)? I'm also not sure whether you mention which way around you ended up doing filtering + sampling (first value or first uncertainty or maybe some combination) and why.\n\nIn the empirical evaluation I'm assuming you report final performances (i.e. after the 100k environment steps). Prior works that you mention (like Cal-QL, AWAC) have shown that during O2O, algorithms commonly suffer from immediate performance drops right after online learning starts due to distribution drift - it would be extremely interesting to see how SUNG performs in this context, which is why another performance metric reporting during the beginning of online learning could be useful or directly plotting the test returns over training time.\n\nI believe some other prior works that are currently not contained should also be considered in the related work section:\n\n[1] Swazinna, P., Udluft, S., & Runkler, T. (2021). Overcoming model bias for robust offline deep reinforcement learning.\u00a0Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI),\u00a0104.\n\n[2] Ghosh, D., Ajay, A., Agrawal, P., & Levine, S. (2022). Offline rl policies should be trained to be adaptive. ICML 2022\n\n[3] Hong, J., Kumar, A., & Levine, S. (2022). Confidence-Conditioned Value Functions for Offline Reinforcement Learning. ICLR 2023\n\n[4] Swazinna, P., Udluft, S., & Runkler, T. (2022). User-Interactive Offline Reinforcement Learning. ICLR 2023\n\n[1] introduces MOOSE, which is a model-based offline RL method that uses a VAE as a regularizer. While your adaptive exploitation scheme is using it in a different way, I still believe it should be mentioned. The works [2-4] are also concerned with offline to online learning, just that their online phase is a little shorter and their adaptations thus look a little different than the one you consider. Still, when thinking about O2O they are closely related and should be considered.\n\nMore a sidenote: Fig. 2b is labeled \"Optimistic Exploration without Uncertainty\". As far as I understand, this method is greedily selecting best actions based on value - it is unclear to me how that is optimistic (i.e. optimisim in the face of what) so maybe the different ablations should be named more clearly.\n\nI realize the weakness section is a bit lengthy, but I think your paper has merits and I am prepared to increase the score if you are able to address my concerns."

                        "value": "We would like to sincerely thank Reviewer K3Su for providing the constructive review, and we respond to the weaknesses and questions as below.\n\n> **Q1: Contradiction between high-uncertainty and near-on-policy actions.**\n\nAs shown in Eq. (7), SUNG involves selecting actions with both high Q values and high uncertainty to guide exploration. Specifically, we restrict our exploration to near-on-policy actions to prevent significant deviations. This restriction offers two key advantages:\n\n(1) Ensuring finetuning stability: By exploring near-on-policy actions during finetuning, we maintain stability in the learning process. The policy improvement relies on experiences collected during exploration. Deviating too far from the current policy could lead to abrupt and undesirable changes, rendering the learning process unstable and less sample-efficient.\n\n(2) Avoiding inaccurate Q value and uncertainty estimation: Sampling actions far from the on-policy actions may result in less reliable estimates of Q values and uncertainty. This unreliability has the potential to throw the exploration direction out of control, hindering the overall effectiveness and efficiency of exploration.\n\n> **Q2: The absolute uncertainty value at which a sample could be labeled as OOD can vary.**\n\nWe fully agree with your perspectives. SUNG detects OOD samples via percentage-based filtering strategy out of simplicity. This approach is intentionally designed to minimize the complexity associated with hyper-parameter tuning. However, we want to highlight that empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of SUNG, as evidenced by the SOTA finetuning performance achieved by SUNG through the proposed adaptive exploitation. We acknowledge that there is room for future exploration in refining adaptive and precise identification of OOD samples.\n\n> **Q3: Why introducing additional OOD detection in the adaptive exploitation.**\n\nAlthough many offline RL methods integrate OOD detection in the adaptive exploitation, they still necessitate heavy conservatism in the objective to avoid the extrapolation error. In this paper, SUNG introduces OOD sample identification to adaptively relax such conservatism for higher sample efficiency during online finetuning. It is noteworthy that certain offline RL algorithms, including TD3+BC, CQL, and SPOT, lack explicit OOD detection. Hence, the proposed adaptive exploitation holds significant importance for these methods to attain desirable fine-tuning performance.\n\n> **Q4: Explanation on trade-off between value and uncertainty.**\n\nIn the suggested optimistic exploration strategy, choosing the ranking criteria as \"value first\" implies that a low value of k indicates a preference for high value, whereas a high value of k indicates a preference for high uncertainty. Conversely, if the ranking criteria are set as \"uncertainty first\", the scenario is precisely the opposite. As such, by altering ranking criteria and k, the algorithm allows for the customization of preferences between uncertainty and Q value to varying extents. This flexibility empowers users to finely adjust the trade-off according to the specific requirements of their realistic scenarios.\n\n> **Q5: How to select the ranking criteria?**\n\nWe detail this problem in Appendix A.2 and A.3. Specifically, we choose uncertainty first for value regularization based offline RL methods, whereas Q first for other offline RL methods. This choice is underpinned by the following considerations. Firstly, we want to highlight the empirical finding that value regularization based offline RL methods (e.g., CQL) are only compatible with preference for high uncertainty, whereas other offline RL methods are compatible with preference for both high uncertainty and high value. We give a detailed analysis for the reason of this finding in Appendix B. As articulated in Q4, irrespective of the chosen ranking criteria, we possess the flexibility to adeptly adjust k to attain the desired preference. Consequently, we select the aforementioned criteria to fix the tuning range within a small value of k, only aiming for consistency.\n\n> **Q6: Other evaluation metrics.**\n\nSince this paper focuses on the improving the sample efficiency of offline-to-online RL, we choose the final average performance of 100k environment steps as the evaluation metric in the main body of this paper for clear comparison. Note that we also provide the full training curve for 30 settings in Appendix D.4 to further demonstrate the effectiveness of SUNG.\n\n> **Q7: Some related works.**\n\nThanks for providing these related works! They are all included for discussion in the revised version.\n\n> **Q8: Label of \"Optimistic Exploration without Uncertainty\"**\n\nHere, the optimism refers to exploration with optimism in the face of Q value. We give detailed experiment settings of the ablation study in Appendix D.5.\n\n---\nWe hope that our response could address your concerns and that you would consider increasing your score."

I have only a single follow-up question:\n\nYou make a distinction between conservatism and OOD detection (see your response to question 3). I would argue the two are very closely related, i.e. conservatism is usually enforced by trying to regularise the policy to only perform actions that can be considered in distribution and filtering out everything else - this seems to be pretty much the same as detecting out of distribution actions and avoiding them. Can you explain to me where you see the key difference between the two, and thus one of the key added advantages your method brings to the table?"
