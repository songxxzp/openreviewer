In particular, the model obtained at time t is never used to predict data from previous times, and hence is not affected by the specific problems of \"continual learning\" such as catastrophic forgetting. There is a significant body of work for online learning methods with delayed labels with which the methods in the paper should be compared with.\n\nThe paper first describe how different ideas do not work and then proposes a simple technique that works better. The first part of the paper is of limited interest. It would be more useful if the authors compare the technique they propose with other methods for online learning with delayed labels."

                        "value": "We agree with the reviewer that we need to differentiate our contributions from the works in Online Learning as we propose a Continual Learning framework. To this end we provide an extensive comparison on forgetting in [F] (see resources in the general comment). We exclude TTA from the evaluation as the feature representation is not altered by the training procedure in our TTA adaptation. Furthermore, note that on CGLM our method achieves twice the amount of backward transfer than the relevant baselines. \n\nOnline Learning and Online Continual Learning, while both involve learning from data arriving sequentially, differ fundamentally in scope. Online Learning typically deals with single-task streams, often assumed to be from an i.i.d. distribution, as outlined in section 2.3 of [20] and the introduction of [21]. In contrast, Online Continual Learning (OCL) is more concerned with non-stationary streams that undergo frequent changes in distribution, where mitigating forgetting is one of several challenges [21, 18, 22].\n\nRegarding our selection of metrics, we note that recent work in OCL, especially in scenarios with task-free or unclear task boundaries, has shifted the emphasis towards reporting final accuracy [22, 23] and adaptation to future samples (or domains) [14, 24, 16], rather than focusing on the measurement of forgetting (i.e., backward transfer). Consistent with [16], our work similarly emphasizes adaptation to future samples as a primary metric. However, for a comprehensive assessment, we will include backward transfer results in the appendix."

The problem setting of continuous learning or online learning with label delay is observed and studied over a decades ago and there are many both theoretical and empirical studies on this problem, please see [1,2,3,4] and reference in these papers. There is lack of discussion and comparison with this line of research. \n\n\n[1] Weinberger, Marcelo J. and Ordentlich, Erik. On delayed prediction of individual sequences.

Results in section 4 provides a good validation on the recent images dataset in continuous learning that the multiple gradient descents in historical data may not benefit generliazation on newly arrived unlabled data due to distribution change. However, in my opinion, it is overclaiming to be a contribution as it is a known result. If there are not enough data at each time stamp (typically in continuous learning setting) and lack of well-designed regulazation term, the performance will even degrade with increasing number of gradient descent because the model overfits to such limited number of previous data with different distribution.\n\n3. Experimental comparisons are unfair. Self-supervised learning and test-time adaptation methods are designed for the learning scenario where the learner does not have access to historical labeled data, or in some test-time training algorithms, the learner can only modify the training process in the training time. Comparing these algorithms with importance sampling on historical data is unfair, since in the latter case we can obtain and use the ground truth label of the historical data. It is more reasonable to consider rehearsal-based continuous learning algorithms as a comparison."

                        "value": "1. **There exist overclaim on the contribution of this paper...**\n\nThe label delay and the literature the reviewer is referring to all fall in the online optimization/learning literature. While there is an overlap with our work that is focused on online continual learning, the setup here is far more challenging. Please read our response in the general comments above on the differences between the 2 domains both in the definition of the problems and the algorithms used. As we explain in detail in [F] existing work does not overlap or does not scale to this regime. More specifically, two of the four suggested works do not even consider time-evolving distributions. The largest dataset of the 4 works [9,10,11,12] consists of 2310 data points with 19 features. Our work is the first one to consider algorithms in the large scale (39M high resolution images) setting with over 10k sample delay and the first one to evaluate backward transfer in the label delay setting.\n\n2. **... it is overclaiming to be a contribution as it is a known result...**\n\nThere is no prior art that reports this phenomena at such scale. While the observed behaviour is expected, we disagree with the reviewer that this is a known result. We do experiments on 17,000x more samples of 2,900x more dimensions than the most complex experimental setup across all suggested works - this inevitably leads to significantly different findings and contributions. Rejecting new findings on the basis of not citing outdated work puts a significant burden on scientific progress.\n \n\n3. **Experimental comparisons are unfair.**\n\n>\"Self-supervised learning and test-time adaptation methods are designed for the learning scenario where the learner does not have access to historical labeled data, or in some test-time training algorithms, the learner can only modify the training process in the training time.\" \n\nTTA and SSL methods do not assume access to prior data however they are particularly tailored to handle domain shift, which is our hypothesized root cause of the degradation in online accuracy. Even though they are targeting this domain shift (using the newest unlabelled data) they are incapable of bridging this gap without labels. Moreover, all TTA and SSL methods we compare against, as stated in Section 5.1 - Experimental setup, in fact are augmented with the memory replay strategy (illustrated in Figure [E]) in which these methods aim to preserve performance on prior data through memory rehearsal while adapting to new data. \n\n\n4. **It is more reasonable to consider rehearsal-based continuous learning algorithms as a comparison.**\n\nWe would like to ask for clarification, as in which methods should we directly compare against? \nMore specifically, we take the best performing method from [16] namely Experience Replay (ER)[19]. In the reported experiments of [16] (e.g. Figure 3) the rehearsal based continual learning methods like MIR[17] and GSS[18], requested by the reviewer, are the *two worst performing methods* when compared against ER[19] (which is chosen to be the Na\u00efve baseline in our paper). Since our experimental setup is identical to [16], we can directly report these results in our work. Furthermore, in Figure 3 of [16], notice that the performance gap between ER-GSS and ER-MIR in the non-delayed scenario is larger than (in Figure 1 of our paper) the gap between the non-delayed ER and the d=100 ER method."

We would like to draw the other reviewer's attention to the claims on the thoroughness of our experiment and the simplicity of our method. We believe these are indeed the key contributions of our work.\n\n\n## Weaknesses\n1. **how could model trained on it outperform a model trained on the newest data with labels?**\n\nIt can be due to multiple factors: \n- Refer to our Ablation studies for overfitting on an outdated distribution (also mentioned by reviewer jtG8): when multiple iterations are taken, the Naive baseline might overfit on the supervised data which does not hurt the on-line accuracy when the delay is small but with increasing delay the distribution shift is increased too. This is why even RR can significantly outperform Naive (Figure 5 left in our paper).\n- In the original experiments the memory size was limited (40K), please refer to our experiments with 2^19 memory size in the updated paper. We observe that IWMS only converges to Naive w/o delay and cannot outperform it neither on CLOC nor CGLM.\n\n2. **Can you explain why the proposed IWMS performance is so different between CLOC and CGLM?**\n\nCertainly! Our two key observations are:\n- There is little to no correlation of the image content to the label on CLOC that may lead to such extensive differences in the results, however evaluations on this dataset is expected in the Online Continual Learning literature. See the supplementary material for examples of extremely low quality images in CLOC. \n- Furthermore, the difference in performance between the two datasets is possibly due to excessive concept drift in CLOC (reinforced by findings in [15]) while close to no concept drift in CGLM. While both dataset show covariate shift, CGLM does not exhibit concept drift (input to a previously different category appears under a new label) whereas CLOC does. For example a sunny beach could belong to Australia during December, while in June a visually very similar image would be a lot more likely to be taken in Spain or the US. As pointed out by reviewer nqA5 and prior work [4], detecting and handling concept drift before observing the actual labels is theoretically impossible. While our method successfully tackles the challenges of covariate shift, in case of concept drift our method recalls samples belonging to all potential candidate classes (regardless of their future ground truth label) which may be the ideal solution to the problem without any knowledge about the future, however is less robust against unpredictable changes in the stream. Such unpredictable changes are more prominent in CLOC, thus the difference in performance.\n\nWe will include this explanation in the main paper and provide details in the supplementary materials.\nHowever, if the reviewer is referring to semi-supervised methods that use pseudo-labeling, we have provided further  experiments in Figure [B,C,D].\n\n3. **Typos**\n\nwe thank the reviewer for the thoroughness and we have fixed the typos in the main paper\n\n4. **In page 8, memory buffer is introduced without detailed description. What samples included in the buffer, what's the frequency to update the buffer.**\n\nThe buffer follows the same First-In-First-Out implementation as it does in prior work [14,16,19] which we have already highlighted in the experimental setup, Section 4.1."

They study this problem with the additional challenge of label delay, which occurs when the label of a data point is delayed and hence it cannot be immediately used for training.\n\nThey run different experiments using existing techniques such as SSL (Semi-Supervised Learning) and TTA  (Test-Time adaptation) to leverage the unlabeled data, however, in their analysis, they find out that these methods do not outperform the naive approach to discard the unlabeled data until one receive the labels. To address this problem, they propose a new method called Weighted Memory Sampling that leverages the unlabeled data as follows: the unlabeled data is used to find labeled data points that are similar (feature representation) so that we can use the latter data for training. This heuristic allows the authors to address distribution drift since it can possibly adapt to the change in distributions by using similar points from the past.\n\nThey run different experiments to verify the effectiveness of their approach and show that it indeed performs better than the previously tried baselines."

In particular, I think your method can only work correctly if there is a shift in the covariate distribution, but it cannot detect a shift in the label distribution (but this is probably impossible because of the label delay)."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for recognizing our research direction, extensive experiments, and proposed alogrithm, as well as their valuable suggestions. Here are our responses to each of the comments. \n\n1.  **additional benchmarks that could be used**\n\nThe suggestion for the benchmark is a really good idea, and the proposed dataset Wild-time contains a large number of of real world problems, which is quite aligned with our original intention of the paper. However, we want to clarify some properties of our online continual learning setting. Our experimental stream is ordered strictly over time, and each sample on the stream has a unique time step label. \nOn such a stream, the batch is for the evaluation of the last time step and for training of the current time step with whatever choice of batch size, there is always the time shift of one batch.\nMost tasks in the Wild-Time benchmark do not have such properties, and thus require further considerations and modifications. Due to the time limit, we could not evaluate our approach on Wild-Time. We will cite them and benchmark Wild-Time in our future research. \n\n2.  **It would be interesting to relate your measure of similarities with other quantities that were computed in domain adaptation**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for mentioning the distribution shift. Measuring the distribution shift explicitly is an interesting and important avenue for the further analysis of our method. However, some traditional domain adaptation metrics, such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), $\\mathcal{H}$ distance, or Wasserstein distance, are hard to measure in an ever-changing online stream. Most of them rely on two distinct, time-invariant disitributions (namely source and target) with large amounts of data readily available. They would be highly sensitive to the design choices of model and data.\n\nWe want to note that such analysis has been already carried out on the two benchmarks we use in prior literature, and is tightly correlated with the quantities suggested by the reviewer for measuring the shift:\n- In CLOC [14] there is a section dedicated to \"Validating the Distribution Shift of CLOC\" where they compare the performance of two models, one trained on a limited temporal range, and the other trained on the entire temporal range, over the validation stream. The degradation of the first mentioned model demonstrates the distribution shift. \n- RapidOCL [15] uses \"blind classifiers\" predictors that completely ignore the input data yet still achieve unrealistically high accuracy due to strong temporal label correlations. \n\n3. **your method can only work correctly if there is a shift in the covariate distribution, but it cannot detect a shift in the label distribution**\n\nYour description is indeed accurate. Our proposed method IWMS is, indeed, designed  for covariate shifts, since we hope to synthesize future batches by data from previous time-steps. \n\nActually dealing with label drift(also known as concept drift, where the input data distribution remains the same/similar but the corresponding label distribution changes) is intrincally hard and almost impossible, as mentioned in [4]: \"One interesting connection between semi-supervised learning and unsupervised concept (label) drift detection is that if the underlying marginal data distribution \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc4b) over the input does not contain information about \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc4b) or indicates changes on \ud835\udc43 (\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc4b), then it is impossible to exploit unlabelled data to improve a supervised learner (SSL) or detect a change.\"\n\nHowever, in our framework, if the label shift between two categories (either A->B or B-A) has been observed in the past, IWMS will recall samples belonging to both categories that can help the feature extractor to further refine the discriminative patterns used for distinguishing the two categories.  To illustrate this consider the following example: if the model has seen sandy beach images before from Australia (A) and later from Brazil (B), then later on when the stream reveals a new image of a similar sandy beach then the optimal policy is to recall both (A) and (B) from the memory and fine-tune the model to learn more discriminative features on the pictures. This in turn will result in increasing the chances of the classifier making the correct prediction on the yet to be labeled image of a sandy beach."

However, we  argue that the majority of prior art referenced by the reviewer (which we commend) is in fact within the online learning (from optimization perspective) literature as opposed to *continual learning* online/offline literature that is a concern of the paper. The main issue seems to be the contextualization of our work.\n\nAmong them, [4] and [8] are the most related to our work. However, they cannot compete in our limited computational budget as highlighted by the paper [4]: \u201cthe main challenge in adopting such a strategy to a streaming [online] scenario is that it requires multiple passes over the input data\u201d. \n\nPseudo labeling is one important perspective of [B], and we had already done the experiments of using pseudo labeling. The experiments failed since\n- The base classifier C has really low accuracy from the beginning, the quality of the pseudo labels were extremely poor, always leading to a feedback loop on training wrong labels.\n- The correct predictions often have low confidence scores (top-1 softmax scores), and it makes the pseudo-label selection, proposed in [B], unstable. Furthermore, in the attached Figure [C,D], by increasing the delay it becomes less and less probable that a correct prediction will have a high enough confidence score\n\nWe have a more detailed description of each of the literatures in our provided link [G]. Nevertheless, we will cite the ones that address our problem in particular. If the reviewer considers this a relevant baseline to compare against, we are happy to include the full results in the updated version of the paper."
