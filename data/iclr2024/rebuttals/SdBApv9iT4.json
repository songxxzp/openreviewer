                    "value": "This paper introduces an algorithm for linear MDPs that achieves a regret bound independent of the horizon length ($H$). It specifically analyzes regret by grouping indices with the same maximal total variance for the optimal value function, allowing value functions within the same group, even if values are inhomogeneous, to share samples. Despite its computational inefficiency, this work addresses the research question of whether it's possible to obtain a horizon-independent regret bound in linear MDPs, extending the prior research on horizon-free regret analysis in linear mixture MDPs."

Based on this perspective it seems like an interesting approach to group $H$ bandit problems and share samples to get a $H$-independent regret bound."

                    "value": "- While the analysis of horizon-free regret in linear MDPs, as an extension of the algorithm for linear mixture MDPs, is intriguing, the technical novelty in this paper seems somewhat limited. As mentioned in related work, Zhang et al. (2021b) initially proposed a horizon-free algorithm for linear mixture MDPs, and Zhou & Gu (2022) introduced a computationally efficient horizon-free algorithm. Although it is acknowledged that Linear MDPs become fundamentally more challenging as the dimension of unknown parameters grows with the increasing state space, given that the order of regret bound for minimax algorithms with $H$ dependence in both linear MDPs and linear mixture MDPs is the same (Hu et al., 2023), it is regrettable that this paper only presents a computationally inefficient algorithm despite the existence of computationally efficient $H$-free regret bounds in linear mixture MDPs.\n\n(Hu et al., \u201cNearly minimax optimal reinforcement learning with linear function approximation\u201d, ICML 2022)\n\n- Providing a slightly clearer explanation of the method in the main text would be beneficial. For instance, as mentioned in Technique 3, calculating an upper bound for $\\max\\_{h' \\in [H]} \\sum\\_{k=1}^K \\sum\\_{h=1}^H \\mathbb{V} (P\\_{s^k\\_h, a^k\\_h}, V^*\\_{h'+1})$ is required, but it was stated that a bound for $ \\sum\\_{k=1}^K \\sum\\_{i=1}^{\\log\\_2 H +1} \\max\\_{h' \\in [H\\_i]} \\sum\\_{h \\in H\\_i} \\mathbb{V} (P\\_{s^k\\_h, a^k\\_h}, V^*\\_{h+1})$ was given. A more explicit explanation of how these two bounds are connected would enhance clarity."

                    "value": "- While the set of all possible features $\\Phi$ is not precisely defined, if we define it as $\\Phi:=  \\\\{ \\phi(s,a) : (s,a) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\\\}$, then the convexity of $\\Phi$ implies that for all $\\phi_1, \\phi_2 \\in \\Phi$ and \\lambda \\in [0,1], $\\lambda \\phi_1 + (1 - \\lambda) \\phi_2 \\in \\Phi$. This appears to be a highly restrictive assumption. It would be beneficial to explicitly mention this assumption as a Key assumption like Assumption 1-3 if it is essential, especially considering it is not utilized in existing linear MDP literature (e.g., Jin et al. 2020b).\n\n- On page 7, could you please provide an explanation for the statement, \"$\\mathbb{V}(P_{s,a}, v) = \\phi(s,a)^\\top (\\theta(v^2)) - (\\phi(s,a)^\\top \\theta(v))^2$\" being described as a linear function of the matrix ?\n\n- Could you clarify how the last inequality in equation (11) holds?\n\n- Typo?: It seems that while $l_h^*$ is defined below equation (10), $l_h$ is not defined. Please provide a definition for $l_h$.\n\n- What is the meaning of \"size of transition model\"?"

Suppose there are two actions $a_1$ and $a_2$ with feature $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ respectively, then we can create a new (virtual) action with feature $p \\phi_1+(1-p)\\phi_2$ by playing $a_1$ with probability $p$ and $a_2$ with probability $1-p$. Therefore this assumption is without the loss of generality. \n\n**About the statement** \"$\\mathbb{V}(P_{s,a},v)= \\phi(s,a)^{\\top} (\\theta(v^2)) - (\\phi(s,a)^{\\top}\\theta(v))^2$\" in page 7:\n\nWe can write $\\mathbb{V}(P_{s,a},v)= \\phi(s,a)^{\\top} (\\theta(v^2)) - (\\phi(s,a)^{\\top}\\theta(v))^2$ as $\\mathrm{Trace}(L^{\\top}(s,a) B(v))$ where\n$$\nL(s,a)=\n\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n  \\phi(s,a)\\phi^{\\top}(s,a)  , &  \\phi(s,a),\\\\\\\\\n   \\phi^{\\top}(s,a), & 1\n\\end{array}\\right] $$ \nand\n$$\nB(v)= \\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\n  -\\theta(v)\\theta^{\\top}(v) ,  &   \\theta(v^2)/2,\\\\\\\\\n  \\theta^{\\top}(v^2)/2 ,& 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n $$\nFor fixed $(s,a)$, $\\mathbb{V}(P_{s,a},v)$ is a linear function of the matrix $B(v)$. In Equation.(42), with Lemma 5 we derive that\n\\begin{align}\\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{h\\in H_i}\\max_{v\\in V_i}\\mathbb{V}(P_{s_h^k,a_h^k},v) & = \\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{h\\in H_i}\\max_{v\\in V_i}\\mathrm{Trace}(L^{\\top}(s_h^k,a_h^k)B(v)) \n\\\\\\\\ & \\leq 2(d+1)^2\\max_{v\\in V_i}\\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{h\\in H_i}\\mathrm{Trace}(L^{\\top}(s_h^k,a_h^k)B(v))\\\\\\\\&=2(d+1)^2\\max_{v\\in V_i}\\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{h\\in H_i}\\mathbb{V}(P_{s_h^k,a_h^k},v).\n\\end{align}\n\n\n**About the last inequality in Eq.(11):**\n\nWe have that \n$$ \\max_{\\phi\\in\\Phi} 2d\\phi^{\\top}\\sum_{h=1}^{H-1}\\mu^{\\top} (V_{h+1}-V_{h+2})  =2d \\max_{\\phi\\in \\Phi}\\phi^{\\top}\\mu^{\\top}V_{2} =2d\\max_{s,a}\\phi_{s,a}^{\\top}\\mu^{\\top}V_2.$$\nContinuing the computation, we have\n$$ \\max_{\\phi\\in\\Phi} 2d\\phi^{\\top}\\sum_{h=1}^{H-1}\\mu^{\\top} (V_{h+1}-V_{h+2}) =2d\\max_{s,a}P_{s,a}^{\\top}V_{2}\\leq 2d\\max_{s}V_1(s)\\leq 2d.$$\n\n\n**About $l_h^{*}$:**\n\nThank you for point this out.

                    "value": "This paper considers a regret bound of linear MDP that has a mild dependency on the horizon $H$. The main results are emphasized in the Thm 1 (2nd page). The transition kernel is uniform over timesteps, the Q function is discountless, and the time horizon H is fixed. The challenge here is the optimal action may depend on the remaining time (i.e., should the model explore more or not), which is reflected in the index $h$ in $Q_h$, $V_h$. The process is sequential; before the beginning of each episode k, we declare policy $\\pi^k$ to play it and observe rewards, and evaluation is based on online measure (regret). Assumptions are that 1: bounded total rewards, 2: linear transition kernel (dim: $S \\times d$) and rewards (dim: $d$) with constant scale per feature. Assumption 3 states that the transition and reward share parameter \\theta (dim: $d$).\n\nThe contribution of this paper is to show horizon-free regret (the regret of subpolynomial dependence on H) for MDP under assumption 2 (compared with similar results with assumption 3 by Zhou and Gu 2022). The paper proposed an algorithm (Algs 1--3 combined) to show this regret. The algorithm seems to be computationally inefficient given it defines some quantities that depend on v (a real variable with bounded norm). While the contribution of this paper is written in the paper and it seems fine, I do not consider the paper to be well-written and ready for publication. Since I am not convinced of the correctness of the claim, I lean to be negative on the paper, but I do not have a strong position . I have several questions in the corresponding section for the sake of clarity."

First, $\\mathcal{W}(\\epsilon)$ is not defined in this paper; similar quantities such as $\\mathcal{W}$ and $\\mathcal{W}_\\epsilon$ are defined twice, so I assume these are equivalent. Lines 6--9 in Alg1 loops over $v \\in \\mathcal{W}(\\epsilon)$, which, defines quantities $(\\hat{\\theta}, \\tilde{\\theta}, \\Lambda^k(v), b^k(v, \\phi))$ as a function of $v$. $\\mathcal{U}^k$ is also optimized on the space of $v$.\n* $\\tilde{\\theta}(v)$ is not used in the line 10 of Alg 1 and after?\n\nOn assumption 2: Is assumption (2d) standard? It seems that the number of unknown parameter $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathcal{S}\\times d}$ can be arbitrarily large and it is highly nontrivial to have regret bound that does not depend on the size of $\\mathcal{S}$.\n\nOn the similarity with the (contextual) linear bandit problem. The linear bandit problem is where $x$ is disclosed (contextual is $x$ is $x(t)$) and reward is $r(t) = x^\\top \\theta$ where $\\theta$ is an unknown quantity. In the MDP of this paper, transition has uncertainty and the uncertainty on the reward $r(t)$ w.r.t. transition kernel is much more involved.\n\nThe following are rather minor opinions:\n* VOFUL: Is it by any means related to OFUL? If I understand correctly, OFUL (e.g., Abbasi-Yadkori et al. 2011) is an algorithm for online bandit algorithm whereas Alg 3 is for the uniform confidence bound (also referred as self-normalized bound or martingale bound).\n* Typos. Many periods are missing, for examples:\n> p2: See Section 3 for more details. Due to space limitation, we postpone the full proof of Theorem 1 to Appendix B\n> p6: That is, we need to use all the samples along the trajectory...\n> p7: Fix some eps>0 \n\n* Lines 5, 11, 13 in Alg 1 are comments and can be used some special characters for indicating that, such as $//$"

                        "value": "Thanks for your detailed review! Please find our discussion on the computational complexity in the common response. For other questions, please find our response below.\n\n\n**About paper structure:** \nWe have adjusted the structure of this paper and presented the algorithm before introducing the techniques.\n\n**About the typos:** \nWe have fixed the typos accordingly in the revision. Thanks for the effort to check the correctness of this work.\n\n**About Algorithm 1:**\n\n**About $\\mathcal{W}(\\epsilon)$:**\n\n$\\mathcal{W}$ is  a continuous set and $\\mathcal{W}_{\\epsilon}$ is the discretization of $\\mathcal{W}$. \n\nYou are correct that $\\mathcal{W}(\\epsilon)$ and $\\mathcal{W}_{\\epsilon}$ denote the same set.  \n\nWe replaced $\\mathcal{W}(\\epsilon)$ by $\\mathcal{W}_{\\epsilon}$ and updated the paper accordingly. Thanks for pointing out!\n\n\n\n**$\\tilde{\\theta}(v)$ is not used in the line 10 of Alg 1 and after?** \n\nWe do not use $\\tilde{\\theta}(v)$ in the main algorithm.  $\\tilde{\\theta}$ in the output of Algorithm 3 is used in the statement and proof of Lemma 10, which states that $(\\hat{\\theta}, \\tilde{\\theta})$ is a close estimation of $(\\theta(v),\\theta(v^2) )$. \n\n\n**Assumption 2: Is assumption (2d) standard?** \n\nAssumption (2d) could be find in Section 8.1 in [Agarwal et al, 2019]. The commonly used assumption [Jin et. al., 2020, He et.al., 2022]: $P_{s,a,s} = \\phi_{s,a}^{\\top}\\theta_{s\u2019}$ with $\\||\\theta_{s\u2019}\\||_2 \\leq \\sqrt{d}$, implies assumption (2d). It is possible to obtain an $|S|$-independent regret bound due to the linear structure since we are only required to learn $\\mu^{\\top}v$ for certain vectors $v$.\n\nAdditional reference: \n\n[Agarwal et al., 2019] Reinforcement learning: Theory and algorithms\n\n[Jin et. al., 2020] Provably efficient reinforcement learning with linear function approximation\n\n[He et. al. 2022]  Nearly Minimax Optimal Reinforcement Learning for Linear Markov Decision Processes.\n\n\n\n**Similarity with contextual linear bandit problem:**\n\nWe believe linear MDP has the same intrinsic hardness as contextual linear bandit problem. The transitions are involved but it suffices to learn $\\theta^*_h$  for $h \\in [H]$ to make decisions.\n\n**About VOFUL:**\n\nVOFUL is an algorithm with variance-awared regret bound for linear bandits. The high-level idea is to construct a confidence region for the unknown parameter $\\theta$ and then choose arm optimistically. Both VOFUL and OFUL rely on optimism but the algorithm structures are quite different."

I know these sketches are better than nothing, and in many cases, they help the reader -- we cannot understand a paper without good intuition, and typically, the key points in 25-page proof can be condensed. Meanwhile, these are nothing guaranteed in the sense of math. Making them into key lemmas enables you to highlight the main results without compromising rigorousness.\n\n* Assumption 2: Is assumption (2d) standard?\n* Similarity with contextual linear bandit problem:\n\nI understand, thanks. At least your comment is very clear.\n\n* VOFUL (minor)\n\nI mean, Algorithm 3 builds some confidence ball, but no \"selection\" component.  Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty (OFUL) implies choosing the argmax of some function in a confidence ball, so Algorithm 3 does not represent its name. I do not think this affects the decision, so just please ignore this."

                        "value": "Thanks for your detailed feedback! We have updated our paper accordingly. Please find our response to your questions below.\n\n\n**About Lemma 4:**\n\nWe revise the proof of Lemma 4 in the revision. We are sorry that in the previous version we mistakenly define $\\bar{\\phi} = \\int_{\\Phi}\\phi du(\\phi)$. Indeed we need add a regularization factor as $\\bar{\\phi} = \\int_{\\Phi}\\phi du(\\phi) / \\int_{\\Phi}du(\\phi)$ to make sure $\\bar{\\phi}$ is the geometry center of $\\Phi$.\n\nHere we presented the response to your two questions regarding Lemma 4. Because of the symmetric structure of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we can assume that $\\psi = [1,0,0,\\ldots,0]^{\\top}$. Now we try to explain your questions.\n\n#### Why $\\frac{f(l-y)}{y^{d-1}}\\leq \\frac{f(l-x)}{x^{d-1}}$:\nWe have added a detailed proof in the appendix page 13 (marked in red).\nAt a high-level, $f(x)$ denote the $d-1$-dimensional volume of the slice $\\mathcal{V}(x):=\\Phi \\cap \\{\\phi_1  = x | \\phi\\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\}$ (here $\\phi_1$ denotes the first dimension of $\\phi$). Note that $\\mathcal{V}(l)$ is non-empty, and $\\Phi$ is convex and closed. Let $\\tilde{\\phi}$ be an arbitrary element of $\\mathcal{V}(l)$. We then have that $\\frac{x}{y}\\mathcal{V}(l-y) + \\frac{y-x}{y}\\tilde{\\phi}:= \\{ \\frac{x}{y}\\phi+\\frac{y-x}{y}\\tilde{\\phi}\uff5c \\phi\\in \\mathcal{V}(l-y) \\}\\subset \\mathcal{V}(l-x)$, which implies the $d-1$-dimensional volume of $\\mathcal{V}(l-x)$ is at least $(\\frac{x}{y})^{d-1}$ fraction of that of $\\mathcal{V}(l-y)$ for $0<x\\leq y \\leq l$.\n\n**About (16):**\n\nAfter correcting the definition $\\bar{\\phi}$, \n\\begin{align}\nz &= \\frac{\\int_{\\Phi}\\phi^{\\top}\\psi du(\\phi)}{\\int_{\\phi}du(\\phi)} \\nonumber\n\\\\ & = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0}\\sum_{i=0}^{\\left\\lceil l/\\epsilon\\right\\rceil}\\frac{\\int_{\\phi\\in \\Phi, \\phi^{\\top}\\psi \\in [i\\epsilon,(i+1)\\epsilon) } \\phi^{\\top}\\psi du(\\phi) }{\\int_{\\Phi}du(\\phi)}\\nonumber\n\\\\ &  = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0}\\sum_{i=0}^{\\left\\lceil l/\\epsilon\\right\\rceil}\\frac{\\int_{\\phi\\in \\Phi, \\phi^{\\top}\\psi \\in [i\\epsilon,(i+1)\\epsilon) } i\\epsilon du(\\phi) }{\\int_{\\Phi}du(\\phi)}\\nonumber\n\\\\ & = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0}\\sum_{i=0}^{\\left\\lceil l/\\epsilon\\right\\rceil}f(i\\epsilon)i\\epsilon^2\\nonumber\n\\\\ & = \\int_{0}^l f(x)xdx. \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\nBy re-arrange the inequality, and noting that $int_{0}^{l}f(x)dx = 1$ we have that \n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{ 0\\leq x \\leq z}f(x)\\cdot (z-x) d(x)= \\int_{ z\\leq x\\leq l} f(x)(x-z)dx, \\nonumber\n\\end{align}\n\n\n\n\n**About Lemma 11:**\n\n**About Equation (a).**\nWe make a re-arrangement as \n$$\\sum_{h=h_1}^{h_2} v^2(s^k_{h+1}) \\leq  \\sum_{h=h_1}^{h_2} v^2(s^k_{h}) + v^2(s_{h_2+1}^k)\\leq  \\sum_{h=h_1}^{h_2} v^2(s^k_{h})+1$$\n\n**About $\\bar{v}(s)$:** \nIt should be $\\bar{v}(s) = \\max\\{ \\max_a P_{s,a}v, v(s) \\}$.\n\n**About Equation \\(c\\).** with the definition of $\\bar{v}(s)$ above, we have \n$$\\max\\{ v(s_h^k)-P_{s,a}v, 0 \\} \\leq  \\max\\{ \\bar{v}(s_h^k)-P_{s,a}v,0 \\} =\\bar{v}(s_h^k)-P_{s,a}v.  $$\n\n\n**About Equation (d).**\nThe term c should be replaced by $\\|\\bar{v}-v\\|_{\\infty}$. Sorry for this mistake.\n\n**Typos:**\n\n**About $\\sigma$:** we use $\\sigma^2$ to denote the variance term throughout the paper. We fix the typos in the revision.\n\n**About $O$ in the proof of Lemma 5.** $O$ should be $\\max_j \\sum_{i=1}^n \\phi_i^{\\top}\\psi_j$.  We fix this inequality and delete $O$.\n\n**About $Var$ in Eq.(28):** we replace it by $\\mathbb{V}$. \n\n**About Eq.(29):** We add the bracket to $i$.\n\n**About Eq.(30):** We replace $\\bar{\\Lambda}^k$ by $\\bar{\\Lambda}^k_{(i)}$ in the analysis after Eq.(30). \n The equation \n$$\\bar{\\Lambda}^k_{(i)}+\\sum_{h\\in H_i}\\frac{\\phi_{h}^{k}(\\phi_{h}^{k})^{\\top}}{\\max_{v\\in V_i}(\\sigma_{h}^{k}(v))^2} \\preccurlyeq \\bar{\\Lambda}^k_{(i)} + \\sum_{h=1}^H\\frac{\\phi_{h}^{k} (\\phi_{h}^{k})^{\\top}}{\\max_{v\\in V_i}(\\sigma_{h}^{k}(v))^2} =\\bar{\\Lambda}^{k+1}_{(i)}$$\n\nshould be replaced by \n$$\\bar{\\Lambda}^k_{(i)} + \\sum_{h\\in H_{i}}\\frac{\\phi_{h}^{k} (\\phi_{h}^{k})^{\\top}}{\\max_{v\\in V_i}(\\sigma_{h}^{k}(v))^2}  =\\bar{\\Lambda}^{k+1}_{(i)}$$\n\n\n**About $\\|\\bar{v}-v\\|_i$:** it should be $\\|\\bar{v}-v\\|_{\\infty}$.\n\n**About norm type in Lemma 12:** it should be $\\infty$ norm"
