                        "value": "Thank you for this review. We appreciate the feedback and will address each comment and question in the order they were presented.\n\n**W1:** While the average FOSI iteration takes longer, FOSI requires much fewer iterations to reach the same loss compared to the base optimizer. This can be visualized in Fig 5 in the supplementary material. FOSI's ability to use fewer steps is due to its utilization of additional second-order information in each iteration, thereby facilitating more precise descent steps. We stress that the crucial factor is the time to convergence, not the number of internal steps (iterations).\n\n**W2 + Q2:** \nSince our focus was for FOSI as a drop-in replacement without additional tuning, we did not tune $k$ or $\\ell$. Instead, for optimizing non-convex losses like DNNs, we recommend setting $k$ to a small number (less than the number of classes), and  $\\ell$ to 0. This is supported by the common observation that the number of extreme eigenvalues is generally small, on the order of the number of classes (see for example reference [R1] below), and small eigenvalues predominantly exhibit negative values in real DNN settings. It is worth noting that even if $k$ is lower than the actual number of outlier eigenvalues, the distance between these large eigenvalues can potentially be large, hence the effect on the condition number is still considerable.\nSimilarly, $\\alpha$ can simply be set to a small conservative constant such as 0.01, since the bottleneck for convergence is the base optimizer used for $f_2$, not the Newton method optimizer for $f_1$.\n\nIn practice, as supported by our experiments, it is perfectly fine to simply set $k=10$, $\\ell=0$ and $\\alpha=0.01$ across a wide range of tasks and architectures. \n\nIn our future research, we aim to develop innovative techniques that dynamically adjust $k$ and $\\ell$ based on observed improvements in the effective condition number. This approach will enable us to strike a balance between computational cost and optimization performance. However, we acknowledge that this research extends beyond the scope of the current paper.\n\n**Q1:** Concerning Sophia, we emphasize that, despite the paper's title containing \"Second-order Optimizer,\" Sophia bears a close resemblance to Adam, as both approximate the Hessian diagonal. The distinction lies in Adam's utilization of the second moment of the gradient and sqrt for a conservative approximation, whereas Sophia employs the gradient of predictions and clipping. As such, we can expect Sophia to suffer from similar issues as Adam for non-diagonal Hessians (see Section 4.3 and Section B.2.1). We will add this discussion to the paper.\n\nDRSOM is a first-order method, specifically an approach for determining the most accurate step size for gradient methods incorporating Polyak's momentum. To our knowledge, DRSOM has not been applied to DNNs, but for problems with $n<1000$ dimensions and small datasets. We have been unable to find a Python implementation to support a direct comparison for (our much larger) tasks.\n\nReferences:\n* [R1] Vardan Papyan, 2019, Measurements of Three-Level Hierarchical Structure in the Outliers in the Spectrum of Deepnet Hessians, PMLR."

Our responses to each comment and query in the review are presented in the same order as they appear in the original review.\n\n**W1:** Thank you for this comment. We do think FOSI provides a novel alternative for hybrid 2nd-order optimizers: rather than estimating the inverse preconditioner (the Hessian), FOSI estimates the preconditioner directly. Beyond this, while we are not aware of any specific optimizer with a similar decomposition followed by application of two different optimizers, we would be glad to include such a paper in our discussion.\n\n**Q1:** We are committed to clear notations and will differentiate more explicitly between the preconditioner\u2019s P and PD for positive definiteness.\n\n**Q2:** Absolutely! The FOSI repository is ready to go, showcasing solid implementations in both Jax and Python. Its API conforms with commonly used packages in these frameworks (Optax and TorchOpt) to facilitate seamless drop-in replacement. Upon the lifting of anonymization requirements, FOSI will be promptly released. You can visit the anonymized repository at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/fosi-497F."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for this detailed review. We will address comments and questions in the same order as they appear in the original review.\n\n**W1:** One of the key areas of focus in our future research will be addressing the memory overhead associated with FOSI, as well as parallelization of the algorithm. The first enhancement is to run the ESE procedure on the CPU in parallel to the training process occurring on the GPU. By carefully managing the synchronization between these processes, we aim to reduce the computation bottleneck of computing second-order information and overall training time. This will also reduce FOSI\u2019s memory consumption on the GPU by moving the ESE scratch space memory to the more plentiful CPU memory.\n\nConcerning the execution of the ESE in a distributed setting, our FOSI implementation already supports parallel computation of the dominant $hvp$ operation across multiple GPUs when available (our experiments were performed on a single GPU, however). $hvp$ computation involves gradient computations, allowing for efficient parallelization over the batch axis. We will include this discussion in the final version.\n\n**Q1:** Block diagonal preconditioners such as KBFGS (Goldfarb et al., 2020), Shampoo and its variants [1], and NGPlus [2] have similar limitations as diagonal preconditioners, though to a lesser extent. They may not fully capture the problem's rotation. In contrast, by splitting the problem into two subspaces as done by FOSI, we obtain a full low-rank representation of the Hessian for the first subspace ($\\hat{V}$), which captures both the rotation and curvature of the sub-problem. This contributes to accuracy and stability of the optimization, particularly as it is based on extreme eigenvalues and vectors that can be approximated more accurately. We will clarify the relevant discussion in the Related Work section.\n\nIn particular, KLBFGS is similar to K-FAC as both algorithms employ a Kronecker factored block-diagonal approximation of the Hessian, and both perform similarly (see Goldfarb et al., 2020). As our experiments show, while K-FAC is indeed better than classic LBFGS, its performance is still substantially worse than SGD, HB, Adam, and their FOSI variants.\n\nConcerning the specific paper by Anil et al. [1], this paper proposes a distributed variant of the Shampoo optimizer (Gupta et al., 2018) that also uses parallel CPU computation. As noted above, while we intend to explore such optimizations for FOSI in our future research, we consider it beyond the scope of the current work.\n\nFinally, we wish to stress that FOSI provides a new alternative formulation for hybrid 2nd-order optimizers: while prior work estimates the inverse preconditioner (the Hessian), FOSI estimates the preconditioner directly. Inverse preconditioner approaches such as K-FAC, K-BFGS and Shampoo have been developed and improved over years of research, and there are now many proposed second-order optimizers based on their principles with various targeted optimizations. We therefore opted to compare our approach with the two most representative ones so that we can focus on the difference between our direct preconditioner approach and inverse preconditioner approaches, rather than specific optimization.\n\n**Q2:** The primary focus of our paper is to demonstrate FOSI's improvement over the base optimizer, without additional tuning, and even when the base optimizer is not perfectly tuned. This aligns with our drop-in replacement concept for FOSI. Rather than tuning Adam, we show in Section 4.3 and Appendix B 2.2, figure 9, that FOSI improves performance across a wide range of learning rate and momentum. Also, given Adam's inherent adaptability, it tends to perform well across a relatively broad spectrum of hyperparameters. \n\n**Q3:** This drop is due to overfitting. Note HB similarly overfits: while we cut the x axis after 7000 seconds for clarity of presentation, we can observe HB starting to overfit after around 5200 seconds. In practice, whenever the base optimizer overfits, FOSI\u2019s acceleration of convergence also leads to overfitting, simply earlier. We describe this phenomenon in the initial paragraph on page 8. Throughout our experiments, we have not observed FOSI to overfit more than the base optimizer; FOSI always reaches the same or superior validation accuracy as the base optimizer.\n\n**Q4:** Thank you for this suggestion. We are actively exploring multiple avenues to enhance the efficiency of ESE computation. It's noteworthy that, in line with the reviewer's suggestion of randomized numerical algebra, our current approach already incorporates elements of this concept. Specifically, we utilize a set of samples to approximate the Hessian in the $hvp$ computation. However, we acknowledge there is considerable potential for further optimization in this direction, including the exploration of techniques such as warm starting the Lanczos algorithm and other more intricate methods."

In this context, the convergence rate of the base optimizer concerning the subproblem $f_2$ becomes the limiting factor, given that Newton's method exhibits a quadratic convergence rate on $f_1$. Consequently, for any given base optimizer, FOSI's convergence rate is the same as the convergence rate of the base optimizer for $f$, but with improved constants due to the smaller condition number of $f_2$.  For example, the convergence analysis of GD yield $f^t - f^* \\le \\|x^0 - x^* \\|^2 / (2\\alpha t)$ for $\\alpha \\le 1/L$. In the convex case, $L=\\lambda_1$ (the maximal eigenvalue of the Hessian). Since FOSI-GD reduces the maximal eigenvalue to $\\lambda_{k+1}$, its bound is tighter. \n\nWe will incorporate that discussion into the text.\n\n**W2:** We agree with the reviewer. The pseudo-code was moved to the appendix due to space limitations. We will endeavor to incorporate it back into the main paper for the camera-ready version."
