Thus, they propose to represent the referring object with the coordinates of its bounding box and convert the coordinates into texts in a specific format. By regarding the coordinates as natural language, they can use a small instruction tuning dataset to transfer the knowledge in pretrained models. Furthermore, they propose a self-consistent bootstrapping method to extend dense object annotations into high-quality query-box pairs. The model is trained with a parameter-efficient tuning framework. Results show that the whole pipeline can significant improve the referential comprehension ability of MLLMs."

                        "value": "1) On the novelty and contributions of this work.\n\nThank you for the constructive comments. We would like to clarify the main contribution of the paper. The paper did not claim that transforming bounding boxes into coordinates into the text or the use of parameter efficient training as the main contributions. We summarized the main contributions in the 5th paragraph in the introduction as \u201cOur work is an original exploration to enhance LLMs with RC abilities by leveraging annotations from existing datasets and alleviating the dependence on expensive GPT-4 APIs.\u201d.\n\nThis paper argued that the visual encoder shall be tuned during multi-modal instruction tuning (using Adapter or LoRA) instead of being frozen. Then it boils down how to build a good instruction tuning set for RC tasks at a low cost. This paper proposed a new instruction set construction pipeline by designing diversified RC tasks using the annotations in existing datasets, without heavily using the API of GPT-4. Then plus self-consistent bootstrapping, the proposed method has achieved the best performance on both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Exploiting available annotations in existing datasets and using far less training data to boost the performance of RC capabilities of MLLMs are very useful techniques and the main contributions of the paper to share with the academic community.\n\nMoreover, Shikra [Chen et al. 2023b] was trained with limited RC tasks, which can only deal with the RC tasks included in the instruction-tuning. As shown in the qualitative results, our method shows fairly good generalization ability on various unseen RC tasks, e.g., the two questions in Fig.3. These results further validate the contribution and value of the proposed method.\n\n2) On the performance gain.\n\nFor the ablation studies, please refer to Table 1. It shows that without our designed RC tasks, the model shows limited instruction-following ability on the RC tasks. As more RC tasks are included, the model starts to exhibit better instruction-following ability for these tasks. The performance improves from 0.2\\% to 63.1\\% for PointQA. Moreover, the addition of the RC tasks also leads to 3.2\\% performance gains on IconQA. As shown in Table 2, even without generated query-box pairs, our method outperforms the compared methods by a clear margin. For example, our method outperformed Shikra by about 6.0\\% on OK-VQA. \n\nGiven the intensive study on MLLMs, the authors do not think these performance improvements (+6.0\\% on OK-VQA, +6.0\\% on VSR and +4.7\\% on IconQA as shown in Table 2) are limited. Every step forward over the SotA is very hard, especially given the data/computing resource required by the proposed method. In academia, we do not possess abundant data and GPUs, so IMHO the data and computation efficient method reaching SotA on some datasets is valuable to report to the community timely. Also the authors do not agree that these performance gains just come from the generated new dataset (i.e., Object365 with generated pairs).\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your second thoughts on the technical contributions and performance gains of this paper. Thank you!"

                        "value": "Q1: The limitation on complex images with numerous or overlapping objects.\n\nR1: Yes, this remains a very challenging case to MLLMs. Most of MLLMs, if not all, including the proposed method, can not well handle \u201cimages with numerous or overlapping objects\u201d yet.\n \nQ2: There might be limitations when dealing with less common or more complex RC tasks not covered in the existing datasets.\n\nR2: As shown in Table 2, our method has achieved the best performance on the RC tasks under both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. Any progress on the SotA for MLLMs is hard given current intensive efforts on MLLMs, especially our method requires less training data and computation resources. These results can validate the effectiveness of the proposed instruction tuning dataset construction method.  \n\nOur method exhibits a stronger generalization ability on various RC tasks. The compared model Shikra can only deal with the RC tasks included in its instruction tuning stage. As shown in the qualitative results, our method shows fairly good generalization ability on various unseen RC tasks, e.g., the two questions in Fig.3. Certainly, there are more complex RC tasks to figure out in the future research, as we do not claim the proposed method can handle all RC tasks not covered in the existing datasets.\n \nQ3: It's unclear how well it would generalize to other types of RC tasks.\n\nR3: Current datasets and tasks for multimodal RC tasks are limited. It is hard, if not impossible, to provide a quantitative analysis for other types of RC tasks due to the lack of a benchmark.\n\nFor the instruction tuning, in order to increase the diversity of RC tasks, we propose an efficient instruction tuning dataset construction method. Moreover, we also showed many qualitative results about the RC tasks in the main paper and Appendix."
