In Appendix A.1 in our revision, we have included a discussion of some practical implications of our results, as well as potential ways to further improve ICRL practice.\n\nAs examples, our results highlight that the training labels (expert actions) in the offline dataset matter a lot.

Unlike in-context learning for supervised learning problems (Garg et al. 2022) in which the loss only needs to be calculated on a new test data point since an i.i.d. assumption on the in-context data is assumed, in ICRL the actions chosen by the expert algorithm may depend on the time $t$ and previous actions and rewards. Therefore, to fully imitate the expert at every time step, the loss needs to be calculated on the entire trajectory."

I stand by my original recommendation to accept the paper and have raised my confidence accordingly.\n\nThe paper theoretically investigates the conditions under which Transformers, pre-trained with offline RL datasets, can be trained to perform In-Context RL (ICRL). To this end, the paper distinguishes between an offline algorithm, used to collect trajectories, and an expert algorithm, which is evaluated on the offline trajectories and the goal of the transformer is to learn to imitate the expert algorithm. The main result of the paper is a generalization bound that depends on model capacity (somewhat expected) and on the distribution ratio between the offline algorithm and the expert algorithm to imitate; implying that ICRL is possible if the model capacity is large enough and the online algorithm performs \u201cclose enough\u201d to the expert algorithm. The paper then theoretically analyzes three RL algorithms in detail (LinUCB, ThompsonSampling, and UCB-VI), concluding that Transformers are able to learn these and then perform them in-context. The theoretical analysis is complemented with simulations that support the theory."

The analysis is timely and original, looks very plausible to me (though I did not check the proofs in detail), and sheds some much needed light on the properties of Transformers that are often portrayed as borderline mystical. I think the work lays some much needed groundwork and provides a theoretical framework for analysis of further RL algorithms; I thus have no concerns regarding the paper's significance to the ICLR community.  \n\n**Pros:**\n * Timely problem, approached from a solid theoretical angle. The result is a sophisticated theoretical framework for analyzing RL algorithms and their learnability by Transformers via offline supervised pre-training.\n * Generalization error bound regarding the imitation performance of the Transformer w.r.t. the expert algorithm. Additionally, when assuming realizability, the supervised pre-trained Transformer (log-loss minimization on offline trajectories) is proven to be able to imitate the expert algorithm, given that the offline policy used to collect data \u201cis close\u201d to the expert algorithm (quantified in terms of a distribution ratio).\n * Analysis of 3 concrete RL algorithms, showing theoretically that Transformers can learn to imitate them in-context (with some extra conditions).\n * Simple simulations to confirm the theoretical results for the 3 algorithms."

                    "value": "The paper is interesting and results look good - my main criticism is that the paper stops somewhat short of situating the results within a wider agenda and clearly stating open issues and limitations of the current results. Overall I currently think that the paper is ready for publication and interesting to a significant part of the ICLR audience. I therefore suggest acceptance at the moment, and will update my verdict based on the other reviews and the authors\u2019 response (it is possible that I missed or overlooked some critical details in the theory and required assumptions for it to hold; therefore I have lowered my confidence accordingly).\n\n**Cons:**\n * The paper currently lacks a strong discussion of limitations. The theory requires some assumptions, and while having the generalization bound is very good it remains somewhat unclear how hard/easy it is to make the bound tight in practice (a lot comes down of course to the mismatch between offline and expert algorithm; how easy is it in practice to keep this mismatch low? What can even be easily said about the distribution ratio in practice?). How do the theoretical statements in the paper lead to non-vacuous practical take-aways (after all requiring low distribution ratio between offline and expert algorithm, and sufficient model capacity are not the most surprising requirements)? Or do additional problems need to be solved to make such statements?\n * Another issue that is missing from the discussion (and perhaps even the analysis) is partial observability. If the expert algorithm depends on unobservables, I believe it would be possible to create settings that lead to a failure to imitate the expert; essentially leading to \u201cSelf-Delusions\u201d - see [1]. Taking a wild guess here, but this would probably imply additional assumptions around identifiability? This point becomes even more important when considering humans as \u201cexpert policies\u201d.\n * This is perhaps more a question than a weakness with actionable improvement (so consider this point addressed if it can easily be clarified/answered). I am wondering about the relationship between the transformer learning an **amortized algorithm** (i.e. the trained net behaves as if it were running the algorithm under the hood, but only on-distribution because it is not actually running the algorithm but has learned a function that produces the same outputs) **vs. actually implementing something close to the expert algorithm**. It seems to me that the paper suggests the latter (which is why it is important that Transformers can implement accelerated gradient descent and matrix square roots algorithmically). Naively I would have guessed that the transformer learns an amortized solution rather than the actual algorithm. On-distribution the two are indistinguishable, but typically the amortized solution generalizes less well. There are some experiments that could tease apart the two possibilities (but I\u2019d also be interested in a general comment by the authors; most importantly whether anything in the paper would break with an amortized solution). Sketches for experiments (I do not necessarily expect to see them performed, but they might help clarify the discussion):\n    * Let the offline algorithm not fully cover the state space. At test time input these parts of the state-space (e.g. a coordinate input in a gridworld that is much larger than anything the Transformer has ever seen; but same dynamics, same reward function, etc). An amortized solution should struggle in this case (and potentially break down catastrophically), whereas learning the correct algorithm should not.\n    * Change the reward function at test-time (e.g. picking up bananas in a gridworld has positive reward and apples have negative reward during pre training, but at test-time the rewards are reversed). The amortized solution should struggle in this case.\n\n[1] Shaking the foundations: delusions in sequence models for interaction and control, Ortega et al. 2021."

Or, alternatively, is it possible make a theoretical statement showing that ICRL performance is capped at exactly the level of the expert (even if we used ICRL to generate a new dataset of supervised trajectories where it slightly surpasses expert performance)?\n\n2) After Eq (2): \u201call the algorithm outputs [...] along the trajectory can be computed in a single forward propagation.\u201d Does that also imply having masked (causal) attention?"

In the following, we hope to address each point raised in the review in the order presented.\n\n> The paper currently lacks a strong discussion of limitations\u2026 mismatch between offline and expert algorithm\u2026  non-vacuous practical take-aways?\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have added a discussion of the limitations as well as practical implications in our revision, which is currently in Appendix A.1 (due to the space limit) with a pointer in the Conclusion section in the main text. \nAs one example of a non-vacuous practical take-away, our results highlight that the training labels (expert actions) in the offline dataset matter a lot. When it is itself a proper algorithm that only depends on the past observations, we can learn ${\\sf Alg}_E$ (cf. Theorem 9). By contrast, when ${\\sf Alg}_E$ is the ground truth optimal action $a^\\star$ (which involves knowledge of the underlying MDP), we can learn the posterior average of this algorithm given past observations, which corresponds to the Thompson sampling algorithm as in Decision-Pretrained Transformers (cf. Theorem 11). A discussion about this can also be found in \u201cThree special cases of expert algorithms\u201d (Page 3) where the \u201creduced algorithm\u201d $\\overline{\\sf Alg}_E$ denotes this posterior average.\n\n> \u2026 partial observability. If the expert algorithm depends on unobservables, I believe it would be possible to create settings that lead to a failure to imitate the expert; essentially leading to \u201cSelf-Delusions\u201d - see [1]. Taking a wild guess here, but this would probably imply additional assumptions around identifiability?\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer raising the question of partial observability. It would be helpful if the reviewer could clarify what they mean by \"partial observability\" in this context. \n\nWe agree that when the expert algorithm depends on variables that are unobserved by the learner, the transformer will fail to perfectly imitate the expert. Our Theorem 6 formalizes this notion: we show that the transformer will imitate the expectation of the expert algorithm conditional on the observables, rather than the exact expert algorithm itself. In this setting, the full environment (the decision process instance) is unobservable to the learner. \n\nHowever, the \"self-delusions\" discussed in [1] seem to refer to a different type of \"partial observability\" than what we are considering above. It would be helpful if the reviewer could clarify what they mean by partial observability in this context. Specifically, is the reviewer referring to the formalism of \u201cpartially observable Markov decision processes\u201d? We want to ensure we fully address the reviewer's concern, so additional details would allow us to refine our discussion accordingly. \n\n[1] Shaking the foundations: delusions in sequence models for interaction and control, Ortega et al. 2021.\n\n> \u2026 **amortized algorithm** vs **expert algorithm** \u2026 \n\nAs posited by the reviewer, our *statistical theory* only ensures that the pretrained transformer learns an \u201camortized algorithm\u201d that is only guaranteed to match the expert algorithm in-distribution (same training/test distribution for the bandit/MDP instances), even though our *algorithmic construction* gives the existence of a transformer that actually approximates the expert algorithm in the whole input space.\n\nIn some of our early experiments (not included in the paper), we have indeed found that the learned transformers do not generalize that well to out-of-distribution instances such as shift of reward distribution. Similar phenomena have been observed in other types of in-context learning problems, e.g. Garg et al. (2022), among many others. We have added a brief discussion about this in Appendix A.1 in our revision.\n\n> (How) Could ICRL be used to surpass the performance of the expert (e.g. going from human chess as the expert to superhuman chess)? \u2026 Or, alternatively, is it possible make a theoretical statement showing that ICRL performance is capped at exactly the level of the expert (even if we used ICRL to generate a new dataset of supervised trajectories where it slightly surpasses expert performance)?\n\nIn our setting, we can indeed only expect the learned ICRL algorithm to at most match the expert (i.e., $\\overline{\\sf Alg}_E$) but not surpass it. However, as the reviewer pointed out, that does not rule out surpassing the expert, e.g. by online RL style training where the transformer can interact with the environment in an online fashion. We would like to leave that as future work.\n\n> After Eq (2): \u201call the algorithm outputs [...] along the trajectory can be computed in a single forward propagation.\u201d Does that also imply having masked (causal) attention?\n\nYes, we use the masked (causal) attention in this work (see Definition 1)."

Please see my response to your general response for more details on my final verdict (as well as my updated review).\n\nRe partial observability: I really like the authors' response to my ambiguous question - primarily, I think it is a good idea to have one or two sentences along these lines in the limitations section or general discussion. The main point is that imitation of any expert algorithm has fundamental limitations when the imitator lacks access to certain \"knowledge\". This can play out in multiple ways (as pointed out by the authors' response) - but no amount of scaling (more data, larger transformers, etc) can solve the problem. This is a general limitation of imitation, not a criticism of the paper. What I had in mind in particular is the case where the expert algorithm observes parts of the state that the imitator does not observe, or, equivalently, the expert has an unobservable internal state (this might sound a bit exotic, but I would argue that this certainly applies in the case of RLHF for instance). Formally, this falls under POMDPs, where the belief-state of the expert is not observed by the imitator, leading to a difficult and potentially ill-defined inference problem on the imitator's side. Again, this is not a particular shortcoming of the paper, but an important problem with imitation in general that the paper is not immune to - and pointing it out briefly to readers might be helpful as the problem is often overlooked in in-context decision-making and RL.\n\nRe amortization: thanks for clarifying. I really like the first sentence of the response above (differentiating between statistical guarantee and algorithmic construction). The algorithmic construction is very nice and definitely adds value - the only (small) caveat observed many times before (e.g. w.r.t. Turing completeness of neural networks) is that showing the existence of a set of parameters to implement a particular algorithm with a neural network type can sometimes be a bit vacuous in practice, since *finding* that set of parameters via SGD can reliably fail empirically; thus effectively limiting the representational capacity for due to issues with optimization/search.\n\nI appreciate the authors detailed comments, and want to point out that, also given my initial rating of the paper, I do not consider the issues raised by me as substantial for acceptance - I raised them out of interest, and do think that the answers (slightly) add to improving an already good paper."

                        "value": "Reading all other reviews and the authors' response I personally believe that all issues raised, including all issues raised by ycZf, have been well addressed by the authors. I have therefore raised my confidence accordingly.\n\nI agree with the authors that the independence of Theorem 6 on the transformer architecture is an advantage, and I disagree with ycZf that this makes the title a mismatch or implies that the results are only weakly related to transformers - the overwhelming fraction of modern work on in-context RL is done via transformers, which makes it fair, in my opinion, to focus the paper on transformers, even though some of the main results hold for other neural network architectures. Similarly, the results in Section 4 benefit from a focus on architectures that have attention (aka transformers) - while weak (and as the authors state, inefficient) versions of the results could be obtained for other neural network architectures, transformers are *the* important special case that give Section 4 (practical) relevance. \n\nIssue 3 raised by ycZf, regarding the practicality of the bound in Eq. (6), is somewhat warranted, I think: of course it would be nice to have a tighter bound - but given the nature of in-context RL, I would be surprised to see any theory that could come up with a much tighter bound. I would argue that Eq. (6) is a proper formalization of a very naturally and intuitively expected condition. I therefore consider Eq. (6) highly valuable as a formal expression of a fundamental condition for in-context RL to work. Adding additional structural assumptions (as pointed out by the reviewers) is interesting and of high practical relevance, but will not invalidate the more general Eq. (6). In addition, finding other practical ways to keep the bound low are important (but again: this seems a very natural thing to do in in-context RL; analogously in offline-RL there is only so much that can be done about distributional shift; under arbitrary shifts performance bounds are expected to become arbitrarily large). I would be happy to discuss this further in the reviewer discussion, and could see how one might make a point that Eq. (6) is perhaps a contribution of lower significance w.r.t. immediately coming up with an improved ICRL method - I personally would argue that that is not the aim of the paper."

                        "value": "We are grateful to the reviewer for their thorough review and valuable feedback on our paper. In the following, we hope to address each point raised in the review in the order presented. \n\n> I am not sure the conclusion is a little bit narrow. The conclusion is limited in a supervised paradigm, using pretraining, and in an ICRL setting. It seems that these conditions restrict the conclusions to be general.\n\nRegarding ICRL: We believe the ICRL paradigm (especially with transformers) has received lots of recent attention, and many works keep improving it including Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2022), Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPT; Lee et al. 2023), and more recent ones such as AMAGO [1]. In general, we believe ICRL is a promising way of using transformers to do reinforcement learning, and offers an alternative to other paradigms such as Decision Transformers.\nRegarding supervised pretraining: we believe this is a natural way for transformers to learn to do ICRL, and is actually an advantage (easier and more stable to train) compared with alternatives such as reward maximization using RL training.\n\n[1] AMAGO: Scalable In-Context Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Agents, Grigsby et al., 2023.\n\n> Would different pre-trained method lead to different results?\n\nRight, other pretraining methods may lead to different results. While we use a supervised MLE loss, there exist other training methods such as cumulative reward maximization, e.g. in Duan et al., (2016). However, that method does not give similar guarantees in our setting. We have added a discussion about this in Appendix A.1 in our revision.\n\n> Can learning-from-scratch DT figure out similar conclusion? What\u2019s the difference?\n\nBy \u201cDT\u201d does the reviewer mean Decision Transformers, and \u201clearning-from-scratch DT\u201d as some adaptation of DT to the ICRL setting? (Since the original paradigm of DT only learns a goal-conditioned policy for a fixed environment and cannot do ICRL in new environments). In that case, the \u201cLearning-from-scratch DT\u201d in our opinion is very different from the original DT and not very different from our setup other than perhaps goal-conditioning. \n\n> Will your conclusions help to inspire the empirical study? Such as figuring out better DT-based offline RL algorithms when using D4RL datasets?\n\nWe believe our conclusions may provide several intuitions for empirical study on ICRL: \n* The training labels (expert actions) in the offline dataset matter a lot. For example, AD (using actions generated from some expert algorithm) learns the nominal algorithm, DPT (using the optimal actions $a_i^*$) learns Thompson sampling algorithm instead. \n* The distribution ratio between the offline algorithm and the expert algorithm may affect the generalization properties of the learned algorithm. As shown in both our theories (Theorem 6) and simulations (Figure 4), it is important to have a small distribution ratio between the offline algorithm $A_0$ and the expert algorithm $A_E$ in order to achieve good online performance, otherwise the performance may substantially degrade. This suggests that it is good to always incorporate trajectories generated purely from the expert algorithm (\u201con-policy ICRL\u201d) into the offline dataset, when possible."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our paper and provide helpful feedback! We truly appreciate your comments and suggestions, and believe they can make our work better.\nIn the following, we hope to address each of the points made in the review, in the order as they came out.\n\n> \u2026 Two main sets of results are not as dependent/relevant to Transformers\u2026 any supervised pretraining models that satisfy the approximate realizability assumption should suffice Theorem 6. Is this true? \n\nTheorem 6 indeed does not depend on transformers, and it holds for any model class that satisfies the approximate realizability assumption. We believe this is not a concern but rather a benefit, and this is expected as the result only involves statistical analysis that does not rely on the structure of the model class.\n\n> For the theorems in Section 4, the paper mostly constructs a specific Transformer structure (e.g., 3-head attention + MLP with a specified QVK) and says that this certain Transformer can mimic the gradient update in the no-regret RL/bandit algorithms. My understanding is that the Transformer is an overkill, and this can generally apply to NNs that have similar structures. Is this true?\n\nWe agree with the overall statement that the constructions in Section 4 can be done on other NN architectures that have the similar structures. However, we emphasize that in order for the construction to be *efficient* (with a small number of layers and parameters), our proof heavily uses the specific structure of attention, specifically its ability for token $t$ to efficiently retrieve information from token $1$ to $t-1$, as well as the inner product (between query and key). It is unclear to us whether other sequential architectures such as RNNs/LSTMs can do these as efficiently. \n\n> The idea of proofs of Theorems in Section 4 seems essentially similar to that of Bai et al. 2023, though with nuances. \n\nFor our proof ideas for Section 4, we believe the only core similarity with Bai et al. (2023) is that we also use some form of gradient descent as an iterative algorithm to approximate more sophisticated procedures such as matrix inverse. Other than that, our constructions involve several new ingredients, such as accelerated gradient descent (Theorem 8), approximate matrix square root (Theorem 10), and dynamic programming (Theorem 12), as well as lower-level operations such as token copying. In addition to transformer constructions, Section 4 also involves RL arguments for propagating the approximation error from the single-step log-probabilities to the regret, and for bounding the regret of the soft UCBVI algorithm (Theorem 13). \n\n> If I understand correctly, the distribution ratio R in Equation (6) can be arbitrarily large. This significantly limits the usefulness of the bound. In fact, in many cases (except the Algorithm distillation case), this ratio should be sufficiently large as Alg_E and Alg_0 are usually different, and the difference is accumulated over the entire trajectory. \n\nWe agree that the distribution ratio R can be large when Alg_E and Alg_0 are different. We believe how to get rid of the dependence on R, e.g. under additional structural conditions for the RL problem or the algorithms is an important question, which we would like to leave as future work.\n\n> Minor issues: $M$ is used as both an MDP environment and the number of heads\u2026 $n$ in Equation (5) and onwards has not been formally introduced. Is this the number of trajectories/samples?\n\nThanks for noticing these. We have fixed the $M$ in our updated version. $n$ is the number of pretraining trajectories ($nT$ is the number of samples), which we introduced in the first paragraph of Section 3."
