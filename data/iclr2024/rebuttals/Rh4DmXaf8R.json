                    "value": "The paper analyzes multistep prediction models for model-based reinforcement learning. \nTraining models for multiple steps can yield better performance. However, as every timestep step prediction is required for planning,  different loss compositions for training single-step models with multistep losses are studied. \nThe paper reports that an exponential weighting of loss terms, where longer time horizons have a lower weight, performs better, both in short as well as long-term predictions. The empirical evaluation is based on the cart-pendulum system."

                    "value": "- Sec 4.2 + Fig 1: it is hard to believe that the model with h=10 makes no difference in the random case, but h=50 suddenly makes a big difference. \n    - The inset does not really help, as all lines coincide\n- Sec 4.3 + Fig 2: I am confused. Here $h=2$ ($\\alpha=0$)$ improves performance whereas in Fig 1 it did not?!\n    - Also, I would suggest plotting these results with respect to h=1. So h=1 is a flat line at 0. It would be potentially easier to see differences. \n    - I think the long-term behavior (h>50) might not be so helpful, as such low $R^2$ values render the models useless anyway\n\n- Sec 5.2: I would expect that when I need a model for h-step horizon planning, I would train it with an h-step loss (and then also only evaluate the prediction power up to h-steps. In the plots, there is mostly no visible difference after those steps. But how important is a difference in $R^2$ close to 1? Your Fig 5 suggests small differences can be actually quite important when planning. \n- Fig 4: for h=4 and h=10, the pink lines seems to be missing\n- Also for the non-noisy case, the learned weighting seems very competitive, which is really interesting.\n\n- Sec 5.3:\nI see where little robust results here. for h=10 it seems to be mostly worse and with high variance.\nFig 5: Do I understand correctly that e.g. the red markers are all the same model trained with n=10 loss but used only for planning with h=1, 5, 10... ?\n\nComments: \n- I suggest in a future submission to run the same method on a variety of tasks going beyond just low-dimensional tasks and the DM-control suite. Following up on the learned alphas might be very fruitful and general. \n- testing the strength of the models with a short horizon model-based planning method might also be useful"

We show different manifestations of the same dot along the x-axis (R2 score) to showcase the relationship between the return and $R2(h)$ for different values of $h$."

I encourage the authors to consider a larger suite of benchmarks, (e.g., MuJoCo, Brax, Myriad, MinAtar, Atari), picking the one that best suites their computational constraints.\n- The results on the performance of RL algorithms are not particularly meaningful or significative (e.g., looking at Figure 4 and 5, the performance of all approaches seems to be the same): this might actually be related to the fact that more complex or even just diverse environments might be required to have a better understanding of how dynamics accuracy is related to expected return collected by an agent.\n- Empirical comparison with similar approaches that are mentioned in the related work is missing. For instance, it is unclear why one should use a weighted loss instead of learning a different model for each time horizon."

The correlation between action sequences and the underlying state transitions, as highlighted by Reviewer yoeH, is indeed a significant issue. Our current evaluation method is an approximation that downplays the role of the controller in the dynamics function. We argue that this remains a fair comparison method as it is consistently applied across models. However, we agree that a thorough examination of the interaction between the controller and the visited states necessitates a reconsideration of the current evaluation methodology, beyond just the final return of the agent.\n\nReviewer yoeH\u2019s second point concerns the computational cost of the multi-step loss. This is a primary follow-up idea that we are considering, and we have presented the initial stages of it in Appendix C. Indeed, the analytical form of the multi-step loss gradient simplifies nicely, and we plan to explore approximation schemes that will reduce the current linear temporal complexity."

                    "value": "The paper has two severe weaknesses, first the proposed approach has been evaluated multiple times and second the experimental evaluation is very limited. \n\n1) Multi-step Losses:\nIf I understand the proposed multistep loss correctly, this multistep loss has been proposed and utilized very often. For example, see the references [1-4] and there are many more. I am quite certain that one could even go back to the older system identification literature that talks about the multi-step loss for linear system identification. [4] even provides an ablation study across multiple horizons and systems. Interestingly, the results of [4] paint a different picture that going longer in the horizon is not necessarily better in terms of reward and quite frequently even worse (see Figure 3). The evaluation metrics as well as the RL algorithm are different in [4], [4] uses a CEM-like planner using the learned model instead of an actor-critic, but the discrepancy requires further investigation (see point 2).   \n\nCould the authors please precisely elaborate on how their multi-step loss is different from the previous works, except for the different weighting approach? \n\n2) Experimental Evaluation:\nThe paper only evaluates using the cartpole swing-up task which is quite limited and does not include discrete contact events. Therefore, the paper would need to evaluate on much more and more complex dynamical system. Again [4] shows quite nicely that the results/conclusions from a cartpole do not transfer to a more complex system. [4] shows that for the cart pole, the longer horizon is always better in terms of prediction error and obtained reward, the conclusion cannot be generalized to more complex systems, where longer horizons start to perform worse. \n\nTo make more claims about the multi-step loss the paper needs more evaluation of more complex systems that involve contacts.\n\n[1] Hafner et. al.

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer XNaE for their insightful comments. We now delve into a discussion on the references cited by Reviewer XNaE and how they intersect with our contribution:\n\n[1] Hafner et. al. (2015). Learning latent dynamics for planning from pixels: This paper presents a derivation of a multi-step $\\beta$-VAE bound on latent sequence models trained via variational inference (termed latent overshooting). While the underlying intuition is similar, the context in which we apply the multi-step loss differs, focusing on simple feedforward dynamics models trained via MSE minimization. Moreover, the authors discovered that the latent overshooting variant of their algorithm didn\u2019t yield any improvements and was not adopted in their final agent. This could potentially be due to the fixed value of all $\\beta_{>1}$\u200b, which overlooks the exponential growth of the error, a problem we aim to address in our study.\n\n[2] Abbeel et. al. (2005) Learning vehicular dynamics, with application to modeling helicopters: This paper indeed proposes a similar loss function termed \u201clagged criterion\u201d (equation 4). However, to simplify the non-convex optimization to a linear least squares problem, the authors relax the dependency of intermediate predictions $\\hat{s}_{t+h}$ on the model parameters $(A,B)$. This results in a data augmentation-like technique that instructs the model to recover from its own errors without propagating the gradients through the multi-horizon applications of the model.\n\n[3] Venkatraman et. al. (2015) Improving multi-step prediction of learned time series models: Although this paper begins with a theorem (Theorem 1) that illustrates the exponential growth of the multi-step loss, the algorithm idea \u201cData-As-Demonstrator\u201d is essentially a data-augmentation procedure that \u201csynthetically generates correction examples for the learner to use\u201d. This is akin to [2] and does not involve any gradient-based optimization of the multi-step loss as we propose.\n\n[4] Lutter et. al. (2021). Learning Dynamics Models for Model Predictive Agents: This paper is the closest to our concept as it back-propagates the gradients through the multi-step loss, and we thank Reviewer XNaE for highlighting this. However, as Reviewer XNaE pointed out, the differences in the model architecture, the evaluation metric, and the actor could potentially be confounding factors in our respective analyses. Furthermore, the question of the optimal horizon is strongly tied to the weighting of the intermediate MSE terms as this corrects the differences in scale. This question is not considered in [4], and we aim to demonstrate that it\u2019s a crucial component in maximizing the benefits of the multi-step loss component."
