Besides, the presented analysis is based on the 11 layers _found by visual inspection_. While suitable for a single experiment, this method can't be applied broadly.\n\nThe numerical results you obtain are far from convincing. If the logistic regression can predict the goal reachability in 82% compared to naive 71%, then quite few hard cases were actually explained. Certainly, there are more important features. I'd like to see that you define like 20 different features, exceed 95% accuracy, and then identify those that contribute most. Now, I think that you still miss important features. Also, when you analyze the interventions in Section 3.1 (and others as well), I see quite little difference between no intervention and intervening on all 11 channels. I'm not convinced that you _control_ the policy. I'm convinced that _there is some correlation between the intervention and the intended behaviour_. Furthermore, I think this analysis would be useful if you exceed the impact of moving the cheese. Only then you can confidently claim that you can control the policy and convince me. Now, it seems more like a bias than a control.\n\nOverall, after reading this paper I would agree that you identified _some_ features that contribute to the behaviour, although (as you claim yourself) clearly there are much more of them, which makes the contribution even lower.\n\nI am willing to increase my rating if you prove me wrong in those claims."

Technically, it could be arbitrarily mixed with other features (as long as it can be extracted with linear transformations), rendering the visual inspection impractical.\n\nWhy did you choose this specific layer to inspect?

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you. We\u2019re glad you found our work \u201cwell-written\u201d and addressing \u201can important topic\u201d. We\u2019ve made a number of clarifications below, which we hope will allow you to improve your evaluation score.\n\n\n> The scope of the paper is far too narrow. The study is exhaustive, but it is focused on a particular architecture in a particular environment. Is there any chance of applying those results to other agents in other domains? [...] Besides, the presented analysis is based on the 11 layers found by visual inspection. While suitable for a single experiment, this method can't be applied broadly.\n\n**We believe the purpose of our work is to develop an understanding of the goals and goal representations of neural networks. Carefully studying a particular network is one way of doing this**, similar to studying \u201cmodel organisms\u201d in biology.\n\nIn particular:\n\n* Finding that the goals of AI systems are redundant and retargetable is an important finding. **We find this holds across 15 different agents**.\u00a0\n\n* **There is further evidence of retargetable goals in other agents, like LLMs [1,2,3]**. We will add these to the paper to contextualize the work. We show these findings also hold here.\n\n\n\n> **the numerical results you obtain are far from convincing. If the logistic regression can predict the goal reachability in 82% compared to naive 71%, then quite few hard cases were actually explained**.\n\n**Our aim is not to perfectly predict the generalization of the network. Instead, we show that it is possible to generalize depending on environmental factors**. We think the interesting part of these results is showing that the pursued goal of the network depends on the environment. One might have thought that this would be random. Moreover, we never claim to perfectly predict the generalization.\n\n> Also, when you analyze the interventions in Section 3.1 (and others as well), I see quite little difference between no intervention and intervening on all 11 channels.\n\nIn Fig. 83 (Appendix E), we show that intervening on all 11 channels results in increased retargetability in all cases, even as we grow far away from the top-right path. Therefore we find substantial differences in the behavior when intervening. We admit the differences in the heatmaps can be hard to see; we will improve this. Additionally, there is a notable difference between no intervention and intervening on the 11 channels.\n\n> Furthermore, I think this analysis would be useful if you exceed the impact of moving the cheese.\u00a0\n\nThis evidence shows that the goals of a network can be partially retargeted via online activation editing. To our knowledge, we are the first to give a proof of concept of this ability. We think this is an important finding because it develops insight into alignment methods that reuse existing network circuits.\n\nRegarding defining many features and selecting those which contribute the most, we do initially regress upon ten features. Appendix B contains further details.\u00a0\n\n> Only then you can confidently claim that you can control the policy and convince me.\n\nWe agree that we cannot perfectly control the network in this way. That is why we describe our network as \u201cpartially\u201d controlling the policy. We do not claim to be able to fully control the policy, only that we provide first steps along a pathway to greater control through intervention techniques based on network activations.\n\n\n\n> Can the results that you present be generalized to other architectures and environments?\n\nThere is some evidence showing these results generalize to LLMS [1,2,3].\n\n> Can all those steps you describe be automated?\n\nPotentially! We\u2019ll add this to the paper under future work.\n\n\n> Are there any reasons for the network to learn the goal location as a separate feature?\n\nYes, the convolutional layers do present a \u201cprivileged basis\u201d (the channel activations). However, visual inspection did not reveal an analogous \u201ctop-right\u201d feature. Even though our results strongly suggest that the network tracks the location of the top-right accessible location. Therefore, it is interesting that the cheese was so clearly and redundantly represented.\n\n> Why did you choose this specific layer to inspect? Are those observations valid for many layers and you've just chosen an arbitrary one, or was it a careful decision?\n\nWe first developed the cheese vector technique, and found it worked best at this layer. So we looked into it in more detail.\n\nThank you for the review. We hope our clarifications are useful, and are looking forward to hearing what you think.\n\nBest,\nThe Authors\n\n\n1 - Turner, A., et. al. (2023).

We\u2019d like to make some clarifications, which we hope will allow you to increase your evaluation score and vote for acceptance.\n\n\n\n> The paper lacks further validation of whether the discovered intrinsic representation of the goal in the pre-training policy can be generalized to different policies\n\nWe find evidence that the cheese vector technique transfers across 15 different policies. This shows that our findings generalize across policies. Moreover, we perform our behavioral analysis across the same 15 policies, and repeatedly find evidence that the goals of these policies are context-dependent. **We believe these are valuable findings**. There is other evidence that suggests that we can align policies by modifying activations during forward passes, a technique sometimes known as activation engineering [1, 2].\n\n> The experimental phenomena and conclusions of the author cannot fully support their core contribution. We cannot demonstrate from the experiments that the 'intrinsic representation' of the goal in the policy can be represented by the activations of these 11 channels that are selected by human visual inspection\n\nWe would like to clarify that **we have visual and quantitative evidence that these channel activations depend primarily on the location of the cheese**. We do not mean to claim that all cheese information passes through these channels, but these channels are used by the network to track cheese. The visual evidence we include in the appendix, but we also include resampling results (Pg. 4), where we state \u201cAcross 200 mazes, resampling the cheese-tracking channels from mazes with a different cheese location changes the most probable action at a decision square in 40% of cases, which is much more than when resampling from mazes with the same cheese location (11%)\u201d.\n\n> 3: The presentation of some of the experiments is confusing, and it may be helpful to detail the setup of these experiments in the appendix to help understand the work.\n\nThank you. We\u2019ll improve this. Are there any specific things you\u2019d like to see improved?\n\n> Question 1: Are the activations influenced by the agent's location or different steps? When we aim to control the policy by adjusting the activations, should we modify the activation of the initial state or all other states?\n\nThe activations depend on the agent's location. We adjust the activations at all time steps (i.e., the policy network, as consistently used by the network), which defines a new policy.\n\n\n> Question 2: Does the number of the most effective channels change when the size of the maze is altered? Or will the features found in 11 selected channels maintain consistency with respect to such changes in experimental settings\n\nThe mazes as seen by the network **are all the same size**. We show the \u201chuman-friendly view\u201d, which might be smaller than the full game grid if there is padding at the edges. As a result, the network always sees RGB images of the same size, and the number of effective channels thus **do not change as the maze size is altered**.\n\n\nQuestion 3: Thanks. We\u2019ll clarify this in the camera ready. By the geometric mean, we mean the following equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    P_\\text{path}(s_t\\mid \\pi):= \\sqrt[t]{\\prod_{i=0}^{t-1}\\pi(a_i\\mid s_i)},\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $s_0,s_1,\\ldots, s_t$ is the unique shortest path between $s_0$ and $s_t$, navigated by actions $a_i$. If $s_0=s_t$, then $P_\\text{path}(s_t\\mid \\pi):=\\pi(\\texttt{no-op}\\mid s_0)$. The probability the agent goes through a path depends on the probabilities of each step multiplied together, so we used the geometric mean.\n\nQuestion 4: Empirically we found that the cheese vector worked best there. We\u2019ll clarify this in the paper.\n\nQuestion 5: Thank you. **It is possible to compose some activation additions**. We can subtract the cheese vector and add the top-corner vector together, which leads to an increase in top-right corner seeking and a decrease in cheese-seeking. We\u2019ll add this example to the paper, but we leave better understanding of composition to future work.\n\n\n[1] Turner, A., Thiergart, L., Udell, D., Leech, G., Mini, U., & MacDiarmid, M. (2023).

                    "value": "The authors study generalization of an image-based RL agent trained to find cheese in a maze. During training time, the cheese is always in the top right corner of the maze. During test time, the cheese can be anywhere. As a result, in a new maze at test time, the agent sometimes finds cheese, and sometimes goes to the top right corner.\n\nThey carefully analyze the network's behavior and internal mechanisms, and find key situations in which the agent decides between finding the cheese, or just going to the top right corner. Next, they analyze the network structure and find key neurons in the network that track the cheese. By modifying these neurons, they can somewhat control the behavior."

                    "value": "The authors tackle a very important problem in RL - generalization. Their specific definition of generalization, \"goal misgeneralization\", is less studied, yet is extremely important in the context of modern LLMs, RLHF, and  alignment. Even if we give the agent the \"correct\" reward function, it may still act unpredictably in OOD situations.\n\nTheir analysis of the maze task and policy is quite deep, and has some interesting studies and findings. They find that the agent chooses to pursue the cheese or the corner based on visual proximity.  Their experiments on controlling the policy by modifying internal activations is quite interesting as well."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The paper's deep analysis of the maze-cheese task and policy is its strength, and also main weakness. Many of the analyses and experiments hinge on their knowledge of the task, and also their design of the policy. This leads me to question 1) if these findings hold true for more realistic, complicated and relevant tasks, and 2) if the particular methodology used here, can be applied to other RL agents.\n\nFor example, the interpretability and controllability of the policy hinges on architecture and input image - an image-only, CNN-based policy.  Because the task is a 2D image, and the policy is CNN based, the authors can manually inspect all feature maps to find correlations with the 2d position of the cheese.  \n\nMany tasks though, may be multimodal, non-image based, or even if they are image-based, may be first-person views of a 3d world. Many deep RL agents have different architectures - MLPs, LSTMs, Transformers, etc. The wide variety of possible tasks and agents seems to make it hard to use this approach for future studies.\n\nNext, I did not see any mention of seed variance. Is it possible that these findings only emerge with the correct seed? How general are these results across RL agents, even if we fix the task to the Maze task?"
