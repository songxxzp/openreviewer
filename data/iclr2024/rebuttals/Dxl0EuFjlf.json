                    "value": "Major concerns:\n\n1. The amplitude shifting loss seems not optimal for noisy time series data, which is almost all time series of interest. The MSE loss aims to estimate the expectation of the probability distribution of the time series, which is the optimal solution, while the amplitude shifting loss always introduces a bias so that the prediction is always above or below of the noisy signal. \n\n2. Similar to question 1, in many cases, the amplitude shifting loss will compete against the standard MSE loss. For some problems, MSE loss will be optimal and, for the other cases, probably the amplitude shifting loss makes sense. However, how to decide which one to use?\n\n3. The Fourier loss makes a much more sense than the amplitude shifting loss. It will capture the periodicity of the time series data. Recently, it has been shown in many studies that capturing a periodicity is a key element in time series forecasting. However, the authors should elaborate how they compute the Fourier coefficients. For example, when if the signal is not periodic, the Fourier series do not converge, meaning it is difficult to truncate the Fourier series. So, deciding the dominant frequency is non-trivial. What's the theoretical reason to choose $\\sqrt{T'}$ to truncate the Fourier seires?\n\n4. The loss based on the auto-correlation also makes a sense. However, I don't fully understand the explanation of the weakness of the Fourier loss. The authors explained three reasons why the Fourier method fails to represent the characteristics of the time series. But all of the three reasons exactly apply the same for the auto-correlation function. As the authors explained, if the time series is non-stationary, the auto-correlation also keeps changing, like the Fourier series. As a matter of fact, auto-correlation and Fourier series are like two sides of a coin. \n\n5. What's the logic behind of the structure of the loss function in (7)? Why is $L_{phase}$ grouped with $L_{shift}$? And $L_{amp}$ is separate?\n\n6. It may be interesting to compare the results with DLinear (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf), where they proposed a very simple linear model with trend and seasonality decomposition, which should be similar to the loss functions proposed."

                        "value": "Q1. The amplitude shifting loss seems not optimal.\n> Thank you for your valuable feedback. For clarification, we would like to point out that having a non-optimal solution is often better than an optimal solution as prior work shows [1, 2]. Ishida et al. [1] revealed that providing some \u201ctolerance\u201d for the loss function makes training easier, resulting in better generalization. We also want to emphasize that the noise-robustness of our softmax loss depends on the choice of the distance function. We described and emphasized these issues in Appendix A. \n\nQ2. It seems like $L_{a.shift}$ competes against MSE. How do we decide which one to use?\n> We think that the amplitude shifting is not designed to perfectly replace the standard MSE. Rather, amplitude shifting can be used as a complementary technique (e.g.,  [1, 2]) that allows tolerance for the models that do not necessarily aim at zero distance.  As a result, it achieves greater generalization than MSE, therefore, $L_{a.shift}$ could be used for all the datasets. In Appendix C, we provide multiple qualitative examples to illuminate this issue.\n\nQ3. Questions about design rationale of $L_{phase}$\n> In our design of $L_{phase}$, we chose the dominant frequency with $\\sqrt{T\u2019}$, which is equivalent to the statistical significance (i.e., one standard deviation) on Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, $L_{phase}$ guarantees the minimum number of dominant frequencies as $\\sqrt{T\u2019}$ when handling non-periodic signals. This regularization works as a noise filter, which is helpful in practice (detailed information is available in Appendix A). For an in-depth validation of the noise-robustness of our method, we provide qualitative examples in Appendix C.2.\n\nQ4. $L_{phase}$ and $L_{amp}$ seem to be monotonic. Do they actually have differences?\n> If we used raw Fourier coefficients and correlation computation, your comment would be correct. However, we did not use the raw coefficients and correlation as they are. For clarification, 1) we regularized non-dominant terms in Fourier coefficients and 2) we utilize a \"normalized version\" of full correlation, which is invariant to the uniform amplification (since it is normalized by the norm of signal). We have clarified these issues in Appendix A.\n\nQ5. Design rationale for $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$\n> We introduce $\\alpha$ and $1 - \\alpha$ for $L_{a.shift}$ and $L_{phase}$ since they complement each other in terms of periodicity and statistical differences (in mean value and variance). $L_{amp}$ acts as a supplement, so we set $\\gamma = 0.01$.  Note that we have provided detailed information on the setting and our source code in Appendix B. We have also described the design rationale for each sub-loss, $\\alpha$, and $\\gamma$ in Appendix A. \n\nQ6. It may be interesting to compare the results with DLinear\n> Thank you for your comment. You can check the experimental results of NLinear in Anonymized GitHub (link available in Appendix B). In short, in most cases, MSE and TILDE-Q show comparable performance. However, we find that in the case of the Weather and Exchange datasets, which are hard to forecast due to frequent fluctuation patterns, TILDE-Q achieves better performance. In the case of the Weather dataset, we observe 6% to 12% improvements for NLinear. \n\n[1] Do we need zero training loss after achieving zero training error?

                        "value": "Thank you for your valuable comments! We revised our manuscripts and appendices accordingly. Below are the detailed responses.\n\nQ1. Does $L_{a.shift}$ really satisfy a requirement (i..e, Eq. (1))?\n> Yes, $L_{a.shift}$ satisfies a requirement. In short, we reformulated the \u201censuring equal gaps between all points\u201d into \u201cmaking a uniform distribution of the gaps (i.e., $\\sum_i{p_{d_i}\\log p_{d_i}}$),\u201d which is equivalent to entropy maximization. Therefore, we used the Softmax function for $L_{a.shift}$ and $L_{a.shift}$ satisfies Eq. 1. A detailed explanation of the sub-loss design can be found in Appendix A. \n\nQ2. Could you explain more about your design rationale for $L_{phase}$, especially for the dominant frequency term selection?\n> In our design, we chose the dominant frequency with $\\sqrt{T\u2019}$, which is equivalent to the statistical significance (i.e., one standard deviation) on Fourier coefficients. Furthermore, $L_{phase}$ guarantees the minimum number of dominant frequencies as $\\sqrt{T\u2019}$ when handling non-periodic signals. This regularization works as a noise filter, which is helpful in practice (detailed information is available in Appendix A). For the validation of our noise-robustness, we also provide qualitative examples in Appendix C.2.\n\nQ3. How do you choose $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma$? Could you clarify the design rationale?\n> (Why three terms? Is it empirically selected?) In Sec. 4.1., we describe why we chose those three distortions. We excluded uniform time scaling, dynamic time scaling, and dynamic amplification, as they either require data-specific hyperparameters (e.g., a window size of DTW) or can impede the proper encoding of information for forecasting (e.g., causing a failure to encode periodicity). \n\n> (How do you choose alpha and gamma?) We introduce $\\alpha$ and $1 - \\alpha$ for $L_{a.shift}$ and $L_{phase}$ since they complement each other in terms of assumption on periodicity and the statistical differences (in mean value and variance). $L_{amp}$ acts as a supplement, so we set $\\gamma = 0.01$.  Note that we have provided detailed information on the setting and our source code in Appendix B. We have also described the design rationale for each sub-loss, alpha, and gamma in Appendix A. \n\nQ4. Do distortions always exist among all datasets? How common these distortions are?\n> As we described in Sec. 3.1, distortions are defined between two time-series, which means they are the gap between two similar time-series. We want to emphasize that distortion itself can appear between ground-truth time-series and prediction results regardless of the dataset. If we ignore the potential impact of the distortion and keep using an objective function, which is vulnerable to distortion, the model produces uninformative forecasting results, as shown in the top and middle parts of Fig. 1. For a more thorough explanation and evaluation of the model and cases, we provide qualitative results in Appendix C."

TILDE-Q aims to be invariant to shift and scale distortions, both in space and time, to capture, e.g., shifts in phase and amplitude. Compared to traditional losses, such as MSE and DILATE, the proposed TILDE-Q loss helps various models to generate more accurate predictions on numerous datasets."

(2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099) to your related work section. Otherwise, the manuscript adequately cites related work.\n\n_Quality:_ The writing, presentation, and demonstrations are well approachable and claims are properly supported by exhaustive experimental results. Some comments about limitations of TILDE-Q would be highly appreciated.\n\n_Clarity:_ The organization of the manuscript is appealing and the arguments are well presented and iteratively constructed. In general, the manuscript provides the necessary information to understand the core message and to follow the clear line of argumentation.\n\n_Significance:_ Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and have the potential to provide valuable insights to the time-series forecasting community. Given the computational overhead is not too large, the proposed loss could evolve to an alternative to traditional loss functions, especially replacing MSE."

Since you report that 10 models were trained, it would be easier to assess the loss quality if you provide error variations in form of $\\sigma$ scores.\n2. Given the various computations required to calculate the TILDE-Q loss, it is unclear how much computational overhead the method introduces and whether the benefits outweigh and justify the increased time complexity."

If the TILDE-Q score matches closely with visual inspections, this would be agreat metric as well. It would be a great outcome, if the judgement of subjects on the similarity of two time-series would correlate strongly with TILDE-Q.\n2. Inspecting the qualitative results in the appendix, can you formulate situations in which TILDE-Q performs poorly (consistently)?"

Below are detailed responses.\n\nW1. About $\\sigma$ score and in-depth evaluation of our results\n> We uploaded the results with the $\\sigma$ score in our Anonymized GitHub, which is also provided in Appendix B. Please note that we only provide $\\sigma$ scores in GitHub due to their large size. Additionally, we have updated various qualitative results and their analysis in Appendix C.\n\nW2. Lack of justification for TILDE-Q's computational costs and its benefits\n> We updated our design rationale and discussion of time complexity in Appendix A. In short, TILDE-Q only requires O(n log n) time for its computation, which has an almost negligible impact on the overall time complexity.\n\n\nQ1. Could TILDE-Q serve as a performance measure?\n> Yes. We think that if TILDE-Q is correctly used, it could work as a performance measure, as we show in the results, which will create a major impact on the domain. In addition, researchers could formulate their own measurements if their measurements met the requirements we described in Sec. 4.1. \n\nQ2. Can you formulate situations in which TILDE-Q performs poorly (consistently)>\n> Thank you for your comment. We updated Appendix C, adding descriptions of the current stage of TILDE-Q with qualitative examples."
