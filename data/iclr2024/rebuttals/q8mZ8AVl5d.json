AdaLinks comprise of down- and up- projections and identity connections, forming a bottleneck-shaped residual architecture. AdaLinks are inserted exclusively to the middle between token embeddings and the transformer, and are modal-aware, i.e., a separate set of weights is used for each supported input modality. The claimed advantages of such non-intrusive adapters include low computational costs, minimal interference between tasks, and less engineering efforts to serve the model. The adapted models are evaluated on various tasks, including captioning and VQA for multi-modal understanding, and NLU tasks from GLUE for natural language understanding, and obtained results comparable to full-finetuning and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "* **The advantages of being non-intrusive is not persuasive.** This is by far the most concerning point of mine. Since the performance of AdaLinks still fall behind intrusive methods (e.g., LoRA) in many experiments, it is very important that AdaLinks clearly excel in some other aspects. I list my questions for each of the point 1 and 3 mentioned in section 3.3 as follows:\n  * *Scalable computational cost.* (1) The statement *prompt tuning ... increasing the sequence length, which leads to a quadratic increase in computational complexity* is misleading. The *added complexity* of prompt tuning is actually $O(Ld_{emb}^2r + LNd_{emb}r)$, with the $r$ being number of prompts, $L$ being transformer depth, first item being *added complexity* in linear layers and the second term being *added complexity* in attention layers, from which we can see that the *added complexity* is in fact *linear* to the sequence length if measured by the same standard (i.e., by consider only the additional computation on top of the backbone computation) as used in the previous statement about the paper's own method. (2) Nevertheless, the total cost of the adapted network will be dominated by the backbone cost for most (if not all) known adaptation methods, in which case further optimizing the additional cost of adaptation will bring very limited advantages according to Amdahl's law. (3) It is indeed possible that for some methods, the theoretical additional cost is small but the actual additional cost on hardware is large, in which case the paper needs to give some fundamental reasons why this is difficult to resolve (e.g., due to hardware limitations), ideally with measured performance numbers (e.g., throughput or latency on actual hardware).\n\n  * *Configurable Serving.* The ease of deployment need to be compared to the other well-known adaptation methods in more details. For example: (1) LoRA weights can be merged into the backbone weights as $W_{adapt} = W_{backbone} + W_{up} W_{down}$ without any architectural change. On what specific infrastructure will AdaLink be easier to deploy than merged LoRA with exactly the same architecture before and after PEFT? (2) Adapters [1] are usually inserted before / after / parallel to a whole transformer block. What are the specific reasons making them much harder to deploy than AdaLinks [e.g., What are the specific cases in which *adaptation weights (are difficult) to be transferred to the internal architecture* (quoted from section 5.2)? Or why a fused operator needs to cross the block boundary to make intrusive adapters difficult to insert?]\n\n* **Limited novelty.** Other than introducing the modal-specific adaptation for different tokens, the concept and architecture are very similar to the original adapters [1]. Applying modal-specific projections is also among the first attempts of adapting language models to multiple modalities (e.g., [2, 3] but far from being complete).\n\n* **Community accessibility.** Most results in the paper reported using PaLI-X, which I believe is still not open-sourced at the time of this review. Thus, the community may face difficulties reproducing the results or further developing the method. It would be helpful if the paper could also include some open-source model results for future reference.\n\n[1] Houlsby, Neil, et al., Parameter-efficient transfer learning for NLP., ICML 2019.\n\n[2] Eichenberg, Constantin, et al., MAGMA - Multimodal Augmentation of Generative Models through Adapter-based Finetuning, EMNLP 2022.\n\n[3] Yang, Antoine, et al., Zero-shot video question answering via frozen bidirectional language models, NeurIPS 2022."

It might be slightly easier to adapt to different network architectures, but the AdaLink makes the assumption that the input is a set of tokens, and is only evaluated on transformer architectures, so this is hard to assess. Maybe the authors should evaluate it on different kinds of architectures to make this point stronger.\n\nTherefore, I think this distinction should not be highlighted in the paper. \nIt would be more interesting if the comparison would focus on quantitative metrics, like additional FLOP to the forward/backward passes or the number of parameters (this is reported already), and the experimental results, which are convincing.\n\n## Novelty and related works\nSome papers have proposed similar approaches to adapt textual LLM and visual models together into multimodal models, which are not cited in this paper:\n- BLIP-2 [1], which uses a light transformer model to bridge between the visual and the textual models\n- Some papers evaluate the use of a *single* linear layer [2,3].\n\nThose methods have similarities to the proposed work, therefore the novelty of this work is not as important as claimed. The differences with those works are: (a) they use an already trained multimodal model instead of two frozen unimodal models (b) they use a two-layers MLP instead of a transformer or a single-layer MLP.\nThose works should be cited in the related work, and if possible evaluated on the same models.\n\n## Nonreproducible multimodal experiments\nThe multimodal model is not available to the public. It would be nice to have the same experiments on an open multimodal model like OpenFlamingo or Idefics. \n\n[1]\u00a0BLIP-2 https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12597\n\n[2]\u00a0Limber https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15162\n\n[3] eP-ALM https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11403"

                    "value": "The authors present a method to optimize an encoder-decoder generative model across multiple new tasks with only a fraction of the parameters it would take to finetune the model. Their model called \u201cAdaLink\u201d is made of a small MLP that is plugged between the image encoder and the large language model of a PALI-X model or before the decoder of a T5/FLAN model to stir the outputs of the full backbone toward the respective new tasks.\nThey evaluate their results on multiple VQA and captioning datasets with a raw PALI-X model and an instruction tuned one, and on NLU for the FLAN and T5 models.\nThey compare their method against three baselines: full finetuning, LORA and prompt tuning and show that their method perform better and that instruction tuned models get even better results than non-tuned ones."

                    "value": "- Limited novelty: a lot of papers already use this kind of architecture for image-text generative models.\n\n     1) Visual Instruction Tuning, Liu et al. -> They use a linear projection between the image encoder and the large language model. They freeze the LLM in a first step, showing good results as an adaptation layer, then fine tune the LLM in a second step.\n     2) eP-ALM: Efficient Perceptual Augmentation of Language Models, Shukor et al. -> They use a linear projection between the image encoder and the frozen LLM but don\u2019t use multiple image tokens. Instead they concatenate the projected image token to each layer of the LLM. They show that this method works well across modalities too.\n     3) MiniGPT-4: Enhancing Vision-Language Understanding with Advanced Large Language Models, Zhu et al -> They use a linear projection between the image encoder and the frozen large language model.\n\n- It is hard to tell the gain those PEFT methods allow to make starting from the original model. I think that the performances of the original/MMIT Pali-X in 4 and 32 shots should be a baseline on table 1 and table 4 and the same 4/32 shots baseline for FLAN/T5 should be in table 5."

                    "value": "- While the gain on COCO, going from ~110 in 32 shots to ~140 with PEFT seems impressive, it is hard to tell if the model was already really good (especially the MMIT one) and is just overfitting on COCO. Adding the 4/32 shots baseline would help. You could also do multi-task analysis that is performed on the text evaluations (table 5) between COCO and TextCaps in table 1 and between all VQA datasets in table 4 would help to disentangle overfitting to the specific vocabulary/text length/format of the task from real understanding of the task.\n\n- AdaLink is really good at tuning the model to one task, and is pretty good for multiple NLU tasks (table 5), but it might lack expressivity against other methods such as LoRA in the multi-tasks setup. While prompt tuning is hard in the multi-task case, could you add the LoRA baseline to the Table 5 ? The rank ablation from table 6 applied to the multi-task of Table 5 could also help us understand the effect of the number of tasks on the best rank."
