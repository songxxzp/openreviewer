Through well-written experiments, the\nauthors show how deep linear networks display critical learning periods. They\nconducted two experiments: one focused on competition in a multi-path model\n(similar to our eyes), and the other focused on the effect of critical periods on transfer\nlearning.\n\nThe first experiment reveals that a deprivation deficit in one pathway will result in the\nother pathway to winning the competition and learning all the corresponding features.\nThe deprivation only has an effect if applied in the early epochs. This reinforces the\ncritical learning period claim. The authors also show, by permanently lesioning the\ndominant pathway, that the deprived pathway isn\u2019t dead and will pick up features that\nthe dominant pathway has missed.\n\nThe second experiment highlights the effect of depth and data distribution on the\nimpact that deprivation during the critical period has. It reveals that deeper networks\nare more sensitive to deprivations in the critical period, and the structure of the data\ndistribution also dictates the impact of the deprivation."

We describe how we address their comments below.\n\n> **The authors prove the dependence on depth and data distribution. But how can they claim independence from other factors, like architecture and non-linearities, especially when considering models other than deep linear networks?**\n\nThe reviewer is correct that the point is misphrased. Indeed, critical periods can depend, in part, on other factors (such as optimization algorithm and non-linearities), which has also been shown empirically in nonlinear networks (Achille et al., 2019). We rephrased the point in our introduction and discussion. We want to emphasize, however, that even ablating those details (nonlinearities and optimization algorithm), as done in our paper, we still observe critical periods that depend on architecture depth and data distribution. This means that the effect of other factors is not necessary for the emergence of critical periods in deep networks, and in general may have a less significant effect than architecture depth and data distribution. \n\nIn our revised paper, we ran additional experiments in our multipathway setup where we included nonlinear activation functions (Relu and Tanh) and observed similar trends to in the deep multipathway linear case (Fig 11 and Fig 12 in revision). \n\n>**Figure 2\u2019s markers should be changed. It is difficult to differentiate between a circle and a circle-triangle overlap. Try plus (+) and cross (x) as markers or a straight line (|) and an oblique line (/).**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We modified our multipathway plots accordingly, and we believe it helps with distinguishing between the different pathways.\n\n> **Codebase not provided.**\n\nWe will provide our code along with the final version of our paper. \n\n>**Typos:**\n\nWe fixed the typos. Thanks for the careful reading and for catching those!\n\n>**I understood the use of PyTorch\u2019s \u201c.detch()\u201d for blocking the flow of gradients in the deprived branch. However, shifting the desired target output to ensure learning the unexplained component did not make sense to me. Please elaborate.**\n\nDetaching is how it is implemented in our code. The alternative (and equivalent) interpretation as shifting the target was provided solely to relate it to a more biologically meaningful process. Specifically, consider a deficit where parameters along pathway A are not updated. Without the deficit the Loss is $L_{normal} = (y - W_A^{tot}x - W_B^{tot}x)^2$, and gradients are updated in both pathways. During the deficit (to pathway A) the loss is equivalent to $L_{def} = (\\tilde{y} - W_B^{tot} x )^2$ where $\\tilde{y} = y - W_A^{tot}x$, and gradients only occur in pathway B. We referred to $\\tilde{y}$ as the shifted output.\n\n---\nAchille, Alessandro, Matteo Rovere, and Stefano Soatto. \"Critical learning periods in deep networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019."

We address their concerns below.\n\n>**I think the assumption of the deep linear network is a bit strong. Since in real-world applications, most neural networks require non-linear activations. A deep linear network can be actually approximated by a single-layer linear network.**\n\nWhile it is true that a deep linear network has the same expressive power as a single-layer linear network, we emphasize that the parameterization of a deep linear network leads to complex and depth-dependent non-linear learning dynamics that is sufficient to lead to the emergence of critical periods. By restricting our analyses to deep linear networks, we highlight that the deep parameterization alone (which is shared with non-linear networks) is enough to explain the emergence of critical periods and may indeed be the most important factor underlying them. Indeed, in our updated experiments in our revision paper that we posted, we show that even a non-linear network follows largely the exact same trends as the multipathway linear network in our experiments (Figure 11, Figure 12).\n\n>**Critical periods in artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) may be due to specificities of the optimization process, such as an annealing learning rate, or from defects in the artificial implementation and training, like ReLU units becoming frozen or gradients vanishing.**\n\nWe agree and acknowledge this directly in our introduction as one of the main motivations for studying deep linear networks in our paper. In particular we show that deep linear networks trained with constant learning rate and without nonlinearities also exhibit analogous phenomena, and also permit analytical analysis. As we replied to R1, we don't want to claim that in any model depth and structure of the data distribution are the only factors determining the existence of critical periods. In fact, other papers have shown that choice of optimization algorithm or regularization can significantly affect the critical period (Achille et al., 2019). What we show is that depth and structure of the data are a minimal set of requirements that alone can support the emergence of a critical period, and also enable differential equations that precisely characterize the learning dynamics. We clarified the text to better communicate this.\n\n>**What's the model's generalization ability on more sparse data settings?**\n\nWe interpret this question to be referring to our matrix completion settings. In Fig. 5 right, we examine reconstruction error as a function of the number of entries. In general matrix completion becomes easier with a larger number of observed entries. When we have a very sparse number of entries (1000 entries) the network obtains a large reconstruction error even without pre-training on a different task (this corresponds to the point deficit removal at 0). In the sparse setting too, the network obtains worse reconstruction by initially training on the higher rank task (other points along the curves). \nWe also found that pre-training on a subset of the observed entries adversely affects generalization (Fig 5, left). We added in an additional experiment to highlight that this effect also depends on the depth of the parameterization, with deeper architectures being more affected (Fig 13). \n\n---\nAchille, Alessandro, Matteo Rovere, and Stefano Soatto. \"Critical learning periods in deep networks.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019."

They perform a variety of analyses and experiments, largely inspired by work on critical periods in biological systems, demonstrating that depth and data distribution provide information processing constraints that give rise to the critical periods."

Sure the literal biochemical explanation doesn't hold in an artificial setting, but analogies of this (reduced plasticity) could well occur. I don't think these are 'competing' hypotheses as they are framed; plasticity, imperfect optimization, etc. are *mechanisms* by which critical periods could arise in both artificial and biological systems; it doesn't tell us the reason\u00a0\u00a0(inherent to learning, quirks of substrate, something else, etc.). In the conclusion \"natural information processing constraints\" are contrasted with biochemical processes like plasticity as an alternative hypothesis, but what is (decreased) plasticity buyt a natural information processing constraint? Demonstrating presence in artificial systems doesn't estabilsh it as a general feature of learning, except insofar as we've defined learning narrowly to be done by biological and ANNs (does naive bayes learn? does it exhibit critical periods?). It becomes sort of a circular argument about what does \"learning\" even mean. This commonality is actually supported by your experiments in Fig 3 recreating Guillery's. Anyway, I think the key sentences/claims (e.g. last of the abs) and results stand and are extremely interesting,\u00a0 I would just like to see this framed around mechanisms or instantiations of information processing constraints, or something, rather than competing hypotheses. and maybe acknowledge\u00a0more of the ambiguity of what \"learning systems in general\" means/ (without compromising clarity and narrative, which I believe are strong points of the paper).\n\nTerms used in equations are not explained when introduced\u00a0 in 3.1 -- I know it's from a citation and you might be short on space, but you will lose a lot of readers here and it's a shame not to continue the clear prose you've had thus far.\n\nAround eqn 9, connection of matric completion to what you're trying to do is not clear -- be explicit about how imputing missing values is the same as / allows us to specify\u00a0 task relationships with flexibility.\u00a0\n\nWhile the relationship of experiments to showing dependence on depth is very clear and well-explained, the insights and relationship of experiments to data distribution is much less clear."

We appreciate the positive assessment of our research and presentation of our results. We explain below how we address the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n>**Framing of introduction and conclusion:** \n\nWe appreciate this thoughtful and insightful point. We updated the introduction and discussion to better highlight this nuance \u2013 indeed \u201cnatural information processing constraints\u201d should not be contrasted with biochemical processes. In our introduction and discussion, we aim to emphasize that architecture and data distribution are sufficient for leading to critical periods in deep artificial networks, and that this offers an intriguing, and different lens for understanding critical periods in biological systems. We plan to further elaborate on this in subsequent revisions subject to space constraints and incorporating other reviewer feedback during the discussion period. \n\n>**Terms used in equations are not explained when introduced  in 3.1 -- I know it's from a citation and you might be short on space, but you will lose a lot of readers here and it's a shame not to continue the clear prose you've had thus far.**\n\nWe updated our manuscript to better introduce notation (also pointed out by other reviewers).\n\n>**Around eqn 9, connection of matric completion to what you're trying to do is not clear -- be explicit about how imputing missing values is the same as / allows us to specify  task relationships with flexibility.**\n\nThanks, we updated our manuscript to better introduce the matrix completion setting \u2013 the changes are in blue text of our revision.\n\n>**While the relationship of experiments to showing dependence on depth is very clear and well-explained, the insights and relationship of experiments to data distribution is much less clear.**\n\nWe appreciate the feedback. In general, pre-training on a modified data distribution for some duration can either be helpful or harmful, depending on the relationships between tasks. In the case of critical learning periods, we focus on the case when such pre-training is harmful. Empirically, Achille et al., (2019) found that pre-training on blurred images was harmful for subsequent generalization on normal images, but pre-training on pure noise for the same duration was much less harmful. This suggests that the learning dynamics depend on the complex relationship between the tasks.\n\nIn general it\u2019s difficult to define the \u201ccomplexity of a task\u201d or the relationships between tasks. However, the matrix completion setting gives us the ability to completely specify the task, its complexity, and the relationship between tasks. We find that pre-training on a higher rank task (more complex) leads to worse generalization performance (Fig 5, left). We also found that pre-training on a subset of the observed entries (a partial view of the data, similar to the blurred image experiments) also leads to impaired generalization (Fig 6, left). We added in an experiment to highlight that this effect becomes more pronounced in deeper architectures (Fig 13 of revision). \n\nWe updated the text to better motivate these experiments in text.\n\n>**The main other thing I'd like to see is connections made/discussed with nonlinear networks -- what should we expect to change vs. hold? maybe according to the sources you cite (e.g. Saxe), or ideally, a suite of experiments with e.g. MLPs of increasing depth. Another specific link could be made in Fig. 6 to scaling laws.**\n\nWe expect deeper networks to be more affected by a temporary deficit, and we now directly discuss this connection in the text. This finding that deeper architectures are more affected by an initially training on a related, partial dataset, is consistent with the empirical results of Achille et al., (2019, in particular see Fig 2, right panel of reference) and Kleinman et al., 2023 (in particular see Fig 5 center panel of reference) who empirically found that deeper convolutional architectures were increasingly affected by initially networks on blurred images before training on regular images. We also ran an additional experiment where we trained on a subset of the observed entries, and we found that while a single layer network is not affected, deeper architectures are increasingly affected by a sufficiently long initial deficit (Figure 13 of revision) We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion.\n\n> **inconsistent use of \"artificial neural network\", \"deep net\", \"neural net\"**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the feedback and will better clarify the text. There were times where we wanted to emphasize the distinction between artificial and biological networks, as well as highlight the depths of the architectures, but we will strive for improved consistency and clarity."

This work focuses on why critical learning periods emerge in deep linear network models. The paper investigates the critical learning period that depends on the depth of the model and structure of the data distribution, with supporting experiments. Meanwhile, they also show the learning of features is tied to competition between sources. They analyze the impact of pre-training on some tasks, and there are some simple experiments used to prove the \u201ccritical learning periods\u201d. This work provides analytical understanding of critical periods in deep linear networks and draws connections between artificial and biological learning."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their accurate summary of our work and for their time, feedback, and comments. We explain below how we address the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n>**Improved clarity of the ``linear multi-pathway framework\" (Sec.3.1.)** \n\nIn our revised manuscript, we better introduce our notation in Sect 3.1. The updates are highlighted in blue text. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we believe the changes lead to a more readable manuscript.\n\n>**Only studying deep linear networks seems not enough to clearly understand why deep networks have critical periods, and network depth and data sources cannot guarantee sufficient persuasiveness.** \n\nWe don't want to claim that in any model depth and structure of the data distribution are the *only* factors determining the existence of critical periods. In fact, other papers have shown that choice of optimization algorithm or regularization can affect the critical period (Achille et al., 2019, Zilly et al., 2021). What we show instead is that depth and structure of the data are a minimal set of requirements that alone can support the emergence of a critical period, and also enable differential equations that precisely characterize the learning dynamics. This allowed us to better understand how depth, competition between sources, and data distribution affects critical learning periods. We have clarified the text in our revision.\n\n>**There are fewer categories of experiments, and it would be better if the authors could provide more types of experiments to prove their claims.**\n\nWe ran additional experiments to further support our claims that we include in our revision. Related to the above question, for the multipathway simulations, we included results using Relu and Tanh nonlinearity and observed similar conclusions where deficits early on as in the deep linear case (Figure 11, and Figure 12 in revision)\n\nFor the matrix completion setup, we also ran an additional experiment where we trained on a subset of the observed entries, and we found that while a single layer network is not affected, deeper architectures are increasingly affected by a sufficiently long initial deficit (Figure 13). This finding that deeper architectures are more affected by an initially training on a related, partial dataset, is consistent with previous empirical results of Achille et al (2019; in particular see Fig 2, right panel of reference) and Kleinman et al (2023;  in particular see Fig 5, center panel of reference) who empirically found that deeper convolutional architectures (with nonlinearities) were increasingly affected by initially training on blurred images before training on regular images.\n\n>**For the experiments related to pre-training, I cannot guarantee sufficient correlation with key learning practices. I hope I can explain the motivation for doing this part of the experiment. By the way, this is not to say that this is an obvious weakness.**\n\nIn neuroscience, critical periods are observed in two settings broadly speaking: (1) sensory deprivation, when the input to one sensor is completely absent, and (2) the related setting when the agent initially learn on a abnormal data distribution (e.g., because of anomalous working of the sensor, or abnormal sensory experience) before having access to proper data later in life. While our multi-pathway experiments are targeted at modeling the competition-based effects coming from the first case, our matrix completion setup where we pre-train on a modified data distribution setting more closely models the second case (the network is pretrained on a different data distribution than the one it sees later in training). The matrix completion setup provides a good simple model to probe this critical period phenomena (how generalization on a final task is affected by pre-training on an initial task) since it allows a notion of generalization, as well as a well defined notion of tasks, their complexity, and their relationships.\n\n**Please continue to the comment below**"
