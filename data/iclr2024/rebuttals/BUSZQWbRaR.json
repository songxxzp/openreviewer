Proofs of convergence for Tsetlin machines have been provided in the cases of 1 and 2 input bits. Such a proof of convergence remains elusive in the general case. In particular, for any number of bits greater than 2. \n\nIn this work the authors provide a probabilistic variant of Tsetlin machines. They call their novel framework PCL (Probabilistic Concept Learning). The main result of the paper is a proof that for any clause C_k, PCL converges almost surely to a conjunction of minerals whenever the inclusion probability p_k lies strictly between 0.5 and 1."

Section 2 of our paper provides a description of the original Tsetlin Machine, which should not be confused with the Tsetlin Automaton. It is true that some concepts introduced there are exclusive to the original Tsetlin Machine and do not apply to the basic framework of PCL. The reviewer's concern about the unclear description of sampling has been resolved by removing the relevant content from the paper. The parameters involved in sampling, including the vote sum ($v$), the voting error ($\\epsilon$), and the margin ($T$), are not employed in either the PCL method or its proof. These parameters are specifically used in vanilla TM for differentiating between various sub-patterns. To prevent confusion, we have decided to omit certain notations that are irrelevant to PCL and will focus only on defining the key aspects of the original Tsetlin Machine (check our updated Section 2). We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.\n\nFor information on the practical implications, results, and the generalization of the PCL proof, please refer to the answer provided in the general response section."

It is now clear that the theoretical results on the convergence of PCL do not apply to TMs.\nThis makes a throughout evaluation of the PCL model a necessity. The additional experiments is an initial step towards that goal but, in my opinion, they are not sufficient to convince the general audience that PCL is a promising learning framework. \nI would expect more experiments, mean and standard deviation of the accuracy over repeated runs, training runtime.\nThis of course require some time and effort and in my opinion they should be the priority before deriving any theoretical convergence result. Ultimately, it is not clear to me how significant are the theoretical contributions and how they could benefit other models."

Our article primarily contributes to the theoretical realm, specifically impacting the family of approaches based on the Tsetlin automaton.

For more details on this, please refer to the experimental results in our updated paper and the general response section.\n\nAlso, to clarify, an 'epoch' in our context refers to a single cycle where feedback is provided for all training examples."

However, in the context of PCL, it is possible to learn multiple clauses. These conjunctions act as fundamental elements that are then aggregated to develop a comprehensive Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF).\n\nWe concur that proving the convergence of a machine learning model is essential, as it affirms the model's reliability and stability, ensuring consistent and dependable solutions. This proof not only aids in the development and evaluation of algorithms but also serves as a theoretical benchmark for assessing performance and comprehending the limitations of the model. It is true that some algorithms may perform effectively in practical applications even without a formal proof of convergence. Nonetheless, providing such proof undeniably enhances the robustness of the approach. To support this, we have included relevant references in the second paragraph of our introduction.\n\nFor a more detailed and formal description of PCL, we provided an algorithm in the appendix of our paper. Additionally, we have improved the description of Figure 2 for better clarity.\nFor additional experiments, please\nrefer to the experimental results in our updated paper and the general response section."
