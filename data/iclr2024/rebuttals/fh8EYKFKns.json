The authors provide an extensive list of citations to provide credibility for the risk factors that are outlined, and many points are further expanded in 3.5 pages of small-print endnotes. Currently, the topic of whether LLMs will, in the not-so-distant future, lead to the destruction of human civilization is widely discussed inside and outside the community. Hence -- as the authors state -- a paper examining this issue through the lens of current technical methodology would be much appreciated."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "First, I'm wondering whether ICLR is the right venue for a (rather controversial) position paper like this. My main criticism would be that I don't think that their risk factors (and final conclusions) are well-supported by their reasoning and hence I don't think it'll provide a significant benefit to the community. It seems to me that a through rebuttal of the paper is beyond the scope of this review (that would probably have to be another position paper), but to give a few points:\n- The papers places a heavy focus on reinforcement learning, takes popular phenomena from the field (reward hacking, emergence of counterintuitive behavior, emergence of internal representations of high-level plans) and extrapolates them to LLMs at the level of AGIs. An immediate criticism here would be that equating LLMs with AGIs is a stretch, to say the least.\n- The risk factor of situational awareness strikes me as to be dubious from an empirical perspective. Answers from GPT-4 on whether it is aware of itself would need to be treated with a large grain of salt as we lack insight into their training data. The authors admit in Appendix E that this could be due to specific prompts being used behind the scenes, and then frame situational awareness as being able to include a prompt. I don't think this is the same thing, and in particular it doesn't make sense for the model to use this awareness to deceive researchers and engineers during RL training (the prompt is under human control and can be changed at a whim).\n- In Section 5, my understanding is of the text is that, together with the two other risk factors, an LLM would be able to intentionally fool the \"human overseers\" during the RLHF training stage, only to then detect distribution shift at deployment time and continue to seek power in the real world. This requires several leaps of faith (situational awareness, intentionality on the side of the model, the ability to detect distribution shifts) that are not grounded in current technical abilities and appear to me as pure speculation.\n\nOverall, I would argue that this paper does not live up to its promise of grounding AGI risk scenarios in state-of-the-art training methods for LLMs. This reflects the overall public debate in that arguing for an extreme position (this will be fine/this will be the end of humanity) inevitably requires several jumps in reasoning due to lack of evidence."

Here are some strengths I believe readers should notice. \n\nDense, solid and well-organized positions. Positions start from the introduction to the fundamentals of RLHF and reviews of the related literature. Especially in clarifying the concept of situation-awareness and reward hacking, authors list several concrete examples about how the underlying situation, e.g. reward hacking, would happen in practice. The reasoning is well-supported by the recent literature, also with a simple news article experiment shown in this paper. While most of the opinions are not entirely novel as other works more or less mention some of them in various discussions, this paper compels scattered opinions into a self-contained and well-written form. In short, I believe if a position paper is really worth reading back and forth then it deems successful."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The title is not proper. It is really vague to me by framing something as \u201cfrom a deep learning perspective\u201d. Frankly speaking it could use more work to become concise and precise. There is perhaps no such thing known as \u201cdeep learning perspective\u201d as many things in deep learning are either not unified or still in debate and there is a mixture of knowledge used in deep learning. For example, is this paper based on any statistical learning theories or optimization works? I would suggest using a better term like \u201cpolicy learning\u201d or \u201cin using human feedback\u201d. But, I will let the authors decide. \n\nBefore the discussion of power-seeking models, the discussion more or less relates to the underspecification issue [1]. There might be a lot of ways to define the word  underspecification, but one explanation from me is simply as a situation our training objectives fail to specify what we really desire for. This happens not just recently in the most advanced models tuned with RLHF but ubiquitously on many other tasks. For example, we train a model to classify ImageNet images hopefully with features we use but the model could \u201chack\u201d the task by using spurious features and ends up being adversarially vulnerable. Many short-cuts described in the reward hack look really similar to the underspecification issue. It would be nice to relate some discussions here to the broader underspecification discussion.\n\nA minor point: there are many works, e.g. [2], showing lies / deceptions are detectable in LLMs. How does these works influence people to analyze AGI\u2019s intentions or situation-awareness.\n\n\n[1] D'Amour, A., Heller, K.A., Moldovan, D.I., Adlam, B., Alipanahi, B., Beutel, A., Chen, C., Deaton, J., Eisenstein, J., Hoffman, M.D., Hormozdiari, F., Houlsby, N., Hou, S., Jerfel, G., Karthikesalingam, A., Lucic, M., Ma, Y., McLean, C.Y., Mincu, D., Mitani, A., Montanari, A., Nado, Z., Natarajan, V., Nielson, C., Osborne, T.F., Raman, R., Ramasamy, K., Sayres, R., Schrouff, J., Seneviratne, M.G., Sequeira, S., Suresh, H., Veitch, V., Vladymyrov, M., Wang, X., Webster, K., Yadlowsky, S., Yun, T., Zhai, X., & Sculley, D.
