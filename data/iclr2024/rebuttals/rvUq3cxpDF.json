                    "value": "This paper proposes a novel method to pretrain for RL with only observation sequences without action labels. It first infers latent actions, then learns a policy by behavior cloning on the inferred latent actions, and subsequently refining the policy via RL. What sets this research apart from previous studies is its unique strategy in latent action inference, which features a VQ latent action space and a combined optimization target for IDM and FDM.  Experiments on Procgen demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer NDab,  \nWe sincerely thank you for your valuable feedback on our paper as well as your suggestions for improving it. We address your questions and comments below.\n\n> Do you think this method can generalize to domains with continuous action space?\n\n\n**We updated the paper to include results on two `dm_control` tasks \u2014 please see Figure 9 in the Appendix.** We note that the performance characteristics of LAPO in this setting are similar to our earlier Procgen results, as **LAPO significantly outperforms the PPO-from-scratch baseline.** We aim to provide results for additional continuous control environments in the camera-ready version.\n\nMore generally, we note that the latent action space in LAPO is used to describe observed changes from one observation to the next and is thus actually more closely related to the task\u2019s observation space than action space. In Procgen, where we demonstrate the success of our method, the observation space is continuous.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that many prior works have successfully used discrete action representations in the context of continuous control. For example, `[1]` and `[2]` use manual, per-dimension quantization schemes for actions and `[3]` goes further by replacing Gaussian policies with Bernoulli policies, in a setting called bang-bang control. Several works learn to quantize continuous actions via vector-quantization, including `[4]` which learns a discrete action representation for use in downstream offline-RL and `[5]`, which applies vector quantization to high-level latent actions. Furthermore, `[6]` learns a quantization scheme from action-labeled demonstrations.\n\n\nIn summary, we are confident that the approach taken by LAPO can be applied to many environments featuring continuous action spaces.\n\n`[1]` Janner et al.

Continuous Control with Action Quantization from Demonstrations. ICML 2022.\n\n\n> Does the number of discrete tokens in VQ matter? I would appreciate a ablation on this.\n\nYes, the number of discrete tokens that the latent policy generates does matter. When the number of tokens is large, the outcome is similar the No-VQ ablation in the paper (see Figure 3 and Figure 7). This is because the IDM is then able to pass large amounts of information to the FDM and does not need to learn to compress the transition information, thereby effectively negating the bottlenecking effect of vector quantization. When the number of tokens is too small, the performance decreases too. This is because the IDM is then no longer able to pass sufficient information to the FDM. This is particularly noticeable in environments with partial observability, such as Procgen tasks where the camera moves and shows parts of the game in future frames that weren\u2019t visible in the past since in these environments there is a large amount of information that needs to be passed to the FDM.\n\n> Toy experimental setup: The paper motivates from learning (pretraining) with large scale web data. However, during experiments, the author uses the data from a simulator (Procgen). The pretrain data contains less visual complexity compared to real world data. I encourage author to explore pretraining with real world data (like MC YouTube videos [1] and first-view driving videos [2]). Or, the authors should at least make the pretraining data different from the RL observation data to simulate the difference between pretrain and finetune scenario. One way could be using different backgrounds in Procgen.\n\nWe generally agree and intend to address the evaluation of LAPO against real-world observational data in future work. However we believe that our use of a synthetic benchmark does not reduce the utility or novelty of our work. Similar criticism could be leveled against dozens of papers that used Procgen as an evaluation benchmark, many of which were instrumental in developing the current state-of-the-art methods in RL. Indeed, Procgen was developed to be a useful evaluation setting for developing new methods in deep RL and is an effective tool to rapidly perform experiments in a tightly controlled setting. Likewise, the VPT work itself is based on a video-game environment that only loosely resembles the real world."

Our primary design consideration with LAPO was to push the need for true action labels as far back in the pretraining/finetuning pipeline as possible. While other methods like VPT, ACO, SS-ORL `[3]`, and RLV `[4]` need action labels to even train an IDM, not to mention a policy, LAPO can train both of these, as well as an FDM, with no need for action labels.\n\nWe believe this to be a very useful feature of LAPO going forward, as it could allow us to train large-scale general-purpose latent policies on vast amounts of data from the web for which truly no action-labeled data (or even an RL environment) exists and then decode these policies to a true action space using a comparatively minute amount of labeled data from potentially only a small subset of the tasks present in the pretraining data.\n\n`[1]` Baker et al.

The proposed algorithm LAPO aims to infer actions taking place between two consecutive observations of such data. LAPO models latent representations for the actions instead of trying to infer the true ground-truth action. It does so using two components -- inverse dynamics model (IDM) and forward dynamics model (FDM). The IDM's task is to generate a latent representation of the action that takes place between a given history of observations (including current observation) and the next observation. Consequently, the FDM's task is to generate the next observation given the current observation and a latent representation generated by IDM. Both these components are trained in conjugation to learn latent representations of unknown actions. These representations are further finetuned using true actions via either online rollout or matching actions in an offline dataset. The paper presents results on 16 discrete-action ProcGen environments."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "I find the following weaknesses in the paper:\n1. The utility of learned latent representations for large-scale pretraining: It is evident from the plots that the actions are meaningfully clustered. However, if one has enough compute, to me, it seems plausible to train a transformer autoregressively to generate the next observations in observation-only data, ensuring that the latent representation for actions is also learned. I raise this point because if such a pretraining is possible directly with transformers, the utility of LAPO reduces. Plus, if someone wants to apply the LAPO (IDM + FDM) approach, it could be inflexible compared to a transformer extension. Anyway, I do acknowledge that LAPO does provide evidence that it is possible to meaningfully identify actions in observation-only data.\n\n2. Issue with NOOP: From the IDM-FDM perspective, the NOOP being a null action, its latent representation should produce no transition when sent to FDM. It was unclear from the writing if there is any experimental validation of the same. Also, there is an issue with NOOP and actions with delayed effects. The present IDM-FDM model will fall short in modeling the two separately. (Authors briefly touch up on modeling the delayed effect actions, but I did not find their mention contrasting them with NOOP's.)\n\n3. LAPO with continuous action environments: The current implementation of LAPO involves using vector quantization (VQ). However, using VQ would, in principle, limit the actions to be chosen from a finite set of discrete codes. This, in turn, creates issues while scaling to continuous action environments. The ProcGen games, environments used in the experiments, are discrete action environments, too, and I find it difficult to see how the approach would scale to non-discrete real-world control tasks."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer BaGY,  \nWe sincerely thank you for your valuable feedback on our paper. We particularly appreciate your recognition of the relevance of our method to current RL research as well as the support for our experimental results as seen in the UMAP projection plots. We address your questions below.\n\n> 1. How can we advantageously use the LAPO latent representations for large-scale pretraining on unlabelled videos of control tasks?\n\n*(this answer refers both to the question 1 above as well as the related point 1 in the weaknesses section)*\n\nOur experiments used simple non-recurrent architectures to represent the IDM, FDM, and policy, since these were entirely sufficient to achieve good results in Procgen and demonstrate the usefulness of our method. However, the ideas behind LAPO are agnostic to the specific architectures used. In more complex environments it could very well be advantageous to implement these models with a large transformer. Referring to your statement \"it seems plausible to train a transformer autoregressively to generate the next observations in observation-only data, **ensuring that the latent representation for actions is also learned**\", we thus argue that LAPO is *exactly* a solution to this problem. Given a transformer that predicts future observations based on past observations, we would still require some additional method to extract meaningful latent actions from it. LAPO is such a method.\n\nWe strongly believe that a transformer-based IDM and FDM could allow LAPO to scale to much more difficult tasks by allowing it to model complex temporal dependencies. Thus, we fully agree scaling LAPO to more powerful, transformer-based models is a promising direction for future work.\n\n> 2. Do authors observe that NOOP IDM representation does not affect FDM's transition?\n\nWe agree with your point 2 in the weaknesses section, that from the perspective of the IDM & FDM, the NOOP action is simply an action like any other. However **we disagree that the NOOP action should produce no transition when sent to the FDM and argue that the NOOP action\u2019s effect depends on the environment.** In Procgen \"starpilot\" for example, the NOOP action causes the agent to continue moving across the screen at the current velocity. In other Procgen tasks, the physics of the environment as well as the enemy characters similarly continue to affect the state of the environment, even under the NOOP action. Empirically, we observe that the NOOP action is modeled as expected and generally does not affect the transition in tasks such as \"maze\" and \"miner\", while indeed affecting the transition in the expected way in tasks like \"starpilot\". Please see the answer to the next question for evidence of the latent clustering behavior of the NOOP action.\n\n> 3. Do NOOP IDM representations get clustered similarly to other actions?\n\nYes, similar to other actions, the NOOP action also takes on distinct clusters in the latent action space. However, it is important to note that in Procgen tasks, there are actually three kinds of actions that can act as a NOOP action:\n\n1. The actual NOOP action\n2. Any action that is invalid in the given environment. For example, the task \"maze\" only supports the actions LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. Procgen internally maps all other actions to NOOP.\n3. Any action that is invalid/impossible to perform in a specific state & environment. For example if the agent has a wall immediately to its right, performing the \"move right\" action is identical to performing the NOOP action.\n\nFrom the perspective of our action-free IDM & FDM, these three kinds of actions are indistinguishable from one another and therefore end up in the same latent action cluster. Our reason for omitting the NOOP action clusters in Figures 5. and 7. was simply visual clarity, since the NOOP clusters are not color-coded with a single true action label, but rather with all action labels corresponding to the cases 1-3 above.\n\nNote that this clustering behavior also highlights the strength of LAPO\u2019s learned latent action representations, which tends to cluster actions that are more closely related in actual effect on the environment, without relying on the externally-defined action space, which might contain many redundant or equivalent actions.\n\n**Please see Figure 8 in the Appendix of the updated paper for UMAP projection plots that also include the NOOP action.**"

                        "value": "> 4. How does NOOP compare with actions with delayed effects?\n\nThe latent action space in LAPO models the *observable effects* of the agent\u2019s actions, rather than the actions themselves. In this way, latent actions can be thought of as highly-compressed descriptions of observed transitions.\n\nIn the case of an action $a$ that is taken by the agent at time $t$, but only generates a visible effect at a later time $t+k$, the IDM will be unaware of the action being taken at time $t$ and will only observe the delayed effect. Since at time $t$, true actions $a$ and NOOP are indistinguishable from the IDM\u2019s point of view, the latent action at that time will be the same. As the latent policy is trained to imitate the IDM\u2019s predictions, the policy will generate the NOOP latent action at time $t$, and a latent action describing the visible effect at time $t+1$. We don\u2019t believe this to be a significant issue, since in most environments, actions that have any impact on the state of the environment will usually elicit some degree of immediate change in the observation.\n\n> 5. How will VQ-based LAPO fare in continuous action environments?\n\n**We updated the paper to include results on two `dm_control` tasks\u2014please see Figure 9 in the Appendix.** We note that the performance characteristics of LAPO in this setting are similar to our earlier Procgen results, as **LAPO significantly outperforms the PPO-from-scratch baseline**. We aim to provide results for additional continuous control environments in the camera-ready version.\n\nMore generally, we note that the latent action space in LAPO is used to describe observed changes from one observation to the next and is thus actually more closely related to the task\u2019s observation space than action space. In Procgen, where we demonstrate the success of our method, the observation space is continuous.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that many prior works have successfully used discrete action representations in the context of continuous control. For example, `[1]` and `[2]` use manual, per-dimension quantization schemes for actions and `[3]` goes further by replacing Gaussian policies with Bernoulli policies, in a setting called bang-bang control. Several works learn to quantize continuous actions via vector-quantization, including `[4]` which learns a discrete action representation for use in downstream offline-RL and `[5]`, which applies vector quantization to high-level latent actions. Furthermore, `[6]` learns a quantization scheme from action-labeled demonstrations.\n\nIn summary, we are confident that the approach taken by LAPO can be applied to many environments featuring continuous action spaces.\n\n`[1]` Janner et al.

Continuous Control with Action Quantization from Demonstrations. ICML 2022.\n\n> 6. What are the possible extensions to the current architecture that will allow us to use LAPO seamlessly on real-world continuous action control tasks?\n\nWe believe that the current architecture of LAPO is already well suited for continuous control tasks, as demonstrated in our `dm_control` results in Figure 9 of the updated paper. To apply LAPO seamlessly in real-world settings we are interested in the following two research directions.\n\n1. Compared to many continuous control tasks, Procgen requires less temporal processing and can be solved close to optimally with policy architectures that simply stack the 4 most recent observations (\"frame-stacking\"). To apply LAPO in challenging control tasks, the use of more powerful transformer-based architectures for IDMs, FDMs and policies could be fruitful. This would also address the challenge of partial observability, as recurrence would allow the FDM to attend to the entire history of observations.\n2. Real-world settings might feature diverse data distributions including cases where the pre-training data and fine-tuning data consists of different sets of tasks. Future work should address this multi-task transfer setting in order to be able to leverage unlabeled data from the broadest set of tasks during pre-training and then fine-tune/decode the latent policy with the much smaller set of tasks for which action-labeled data or an environment is available."

We address your question below.\n\n> Do the results of LAPO generalize to other environments, especially in continuous control settings? (such as MoJoCo, DMControl, Meta-World, etc.)\n\n**We updated the paper to include results on two `dm_control` tasks\u2014please see Figure 9 in the Appendix.** We note that the performance characteristics of LAPO in this setting are similar to our earlier Procgen results, as LAPO significantly outperforms the PPO-from-scratch baseline. We aim to provide results for additional continuous control environments in the camera-ready version.\n\nMore generally, we note that the latent action space in LAPO is used to describe observed changes from one observation to the next and is thus actually more closely related to the task\u2019s observation space than action space. In Procgen, where we demonstrate the success of our method, the observation space is continuous.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that many prior works have successfully used discrete action representations in the context of continuous control. For example, `[1]` and `[2]` use manual, per-dimension quantization schemes for actions and `[3]` goes further by replacing Gaussian policies with Bernoulli policies, in a setting called bang-bang control. Several works learn to quantize continuous actions via vector-quantization, including `[4]` which learns a discrete action representation for use in downstream offline-RL and `[5]`, which applies vector quantization to high-level latent actions. Furthermore, `[6]` learns a quantization scheme from action-labeled demonstrations.\n\nIn summary, we are confident that the approach taken by LAPO can be applied to many environments featuring continuous action spaces.\n\n`[1]` Janner et al.

The approach involves training a inverse dynamics model (IDM) along with a Forward Dynamics Model (FDM) using an unsupervised objective. The IDM learns to predict the latent action given the past and future observation. FDM on the other hand uses the predicted latent action, and past action to predict the future observation. Training these two models together for predictive consistency helps learn latent actions that can reliably explain observed transitions. To prevent the model from compressing all of past observation\u2019s information into the latent action, the authors propose using vector quantization which acts as an information bottleneck. Finally, the authors show that latent actions can be mapped to real actions using online RL policy fine-tuning, or by using an offline dataset of action-labeled transitions. The authors show results on the Procgen benchmark. They show that the approach exceeds expert demonstrations by fine-tuning a policy pretrained with LAPO using significantly fewer number of steps. The authors also show through many visualisations that the structure of the latent space is highly interpretable"

I really appreciate the UMAP projection visualisations in the paper!

                        "value": "> 3. Finally, the paper doesn\u2019t fully justify using vector quantization approach to learn disentangled latent actions. While the empirical results do show the efficacy of this approach, I don\u2019t fully grasp why vector quantization based information bottleneck works. Additionally, did the author consider an approach like minimizing the conditional mutual information I(a_t, o_t+1 | o_t) (as in Deep Variational Information Bottleneck, Alemi et al, 2016) to learn a latent action space that is consistent with the transition observed without over-relying on the past observations\n\nVector-quantization (VQ) reduces the amount of information that the IDM is able to pass to the FDM down to a small set of discrete tokens. This reduces overfitting, as the IDM can no longer use a different highly-specific latent action to precisely describe each transition in the dataset, but instead is forced to learn a small set of actions that capture transition information at a high level. Intuitively, this means that instead of being able to represent pixel-level details such as \u201cpixel X changes from color A to color B\u201d, the IDM has to encode high-level information such as \u201cthe player character moves to the right\u201d.\n\nThis hypothesis is supported by several observations reported in our paper:\n\n1. When not using VQ (as in the No-VQ-ablation in the paper \u2014 see Figure 7 and Figure 3 right), we observed that during IDM/FDM training the next-observation reconstruction loss was significantly lower, even though the final policy evaluation performance was worse. This indicates that the IDM is able to pass more useful information to the FDM, but the learned latent action representation is less useful in the downstream policy learning task.\n2. To measure the quality of a learned latent action representation, we used a metric intended to measure how predictive latent actions are of true actions. This metric was computed by training a small latent -> true action decoder network and evaluating its performance on a hold-out test set. In the NO-VQ ablation, this metric was significantly worse. This too indicates that even though the NO-VQ latent action was more useful to the FDM for minimizing the pixel-level reconstruction loss, it was worse at capturing high-level action information useful for inferring the true action.\n3. Comparing Figure 5 and Figure 7 in the paper shows that VQ reduces fragmentation of the latent action space. This fragmentation likely corresponds to the IDM using different latents for analogous transitions in different parts of the state space. For example, in Procgen tasks with randomized background images, the IDM might use a different latent for describing \u201cthe player character moves to the right\u201d for each background. VQ forces the IDM to re-use the small set of discrete latents, thus leading to a disentangled representation.\n\nThank you for the reference to `[1]`. Our approach could indeed be interpreted as maximizing $I(z_t, o_{t+1}| o_{t-k}, \\ldots, o_{t})$, the mutual information between the future observation and latent action given past observations.\n\n`[1]` Alemi et al.
