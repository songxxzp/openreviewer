How it is different from standard Bayesian deep learning evaluation? \n\nWe use classification tasks precisely so we can use standard, well-understood methods for assessing the quality of uncertainty estimation.  \n\n> I want to understand where the benefit is coming from on those eval metrics through a principled way.\n\nThe improvement on calibration metrics is arising because we use approximate Bayesian inference to estimate our uncertainty in fine-tuning weights given a very small number of fine-tuning examples.\n\n**Autoregressive generation**\n\nGiven that this is the first investigation of Laplace for LoRA fine-tuning, we chose to focus on multiple-choice QA because that allowed us to use robust, well-understood calibrations metrics like ECE and NLL.  \n\nAs a next step, we are indeed excited by the possibility of investigating free-text generation: Laplace-LoRA certainly could be applied in this setting.  However, the development of robust, well-understood calibration metrics for free-text generation remains a challenging and open research question. Given the complexity of evaluating calibration in the free-text setting, this extension is out-of-scope here, and we leave it for future work.\n\n**Memory and runtime cost**\n\nWe have added the memory and time cost comparison between LoRA fine-tuning and LoRA with post-hoc Laplace-LoRA in Section 5.4 and Table 5 in the main text.  The upshot is that the dominant additional cost arises from accumulating the low-rank Kronecker factors; that takes about 10\\% of the time, and only slightly more memory (actually about 1-5\\% more memory) than the original finetuning run."

This one together with Weakness #1 above are the major concerns from my point of view.\n3. There was some discussion on the cost to perform Laplace approximation when introducing Fasher. However, there is no empirical results that support it.\n4. The ablation study (LLLA vs LA) is also from the [1]. Only comparing LA with Last Layer LA is not very convincing on where the uncertainty comes from.\n\n[1] Erik Daxberger, Agustinus Kristiadi, Alexander Immer, Runa Eschenhagen, Matthias Bauer, and Philipp Hennig.

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive, thoughtful feedback.\n\n**Novelty**\n\nBayesian deep learning is rarely if ever used by LLM practitioners.  That's because there are currently no effective and efficient methods for Bayesian finetuning of modern LLMs.  Here, we show comprehensively that highly efficient Bayesian methods can dramatically improve calibration in modern LLMs.  That's the key novelty in this paper, and it opens the way to practical applications of Bayesian methods in modern LLMs, along with a far more thorough exploration of Bayesian methods for LLMs in future work.\n\nRegarding the novelty of our Laplace-LoRA approach, we believe its significance lies in the innovative integration of well-studied methods to create a novel framework for Bayesian fine-tuning on LLMs. This integration is not trivial and addresses a critical gap in current methodologies. In addition, we opensourced code that works with any publicly available LLMs on Huggingface.\n\n**Ablations**\n\nLaplace Redux only compares LLLA vs LA for ResNets for simple computer vision tasks such as CIFAR-10.  This tells us very little about what to expect in modern LLM finetuning.  Indeed, we come to the opposite conclusion from the Laplace Redux paper.  They find that LLLA is sufficient in their tasks.  While we find that retaining uncertainty at all layers is important in parameter-efficient LLM finetuning with low-rank adaptation.  \n\nAdditionally, our experiments weren't really directed at finding \"where the uncertainty comes from\".  They were directed at discovering why, when optimizing the prior using the Laplace estimate of the marginal likelihood, the uncertainties for LLLA and LA were so different.  Specifically, the uncertainty for LLLA was far too low, whereas the uncertainty for LA was about right.  Our conclusion was that there is little uncertainty arising at the last layer.\n\nIn response to your request, we expanded our analysis in Appendix G.3, by applying LA to different LoRA layers. Specifically, we experimented with applying LA on the first 8, 16, 24, and 32 (all) layers. While we observed only small differences, there does seem to be a small improvement in the NLL when LA is applied beyond the top 8 layers. \n\n**Memory and runtime cost**\n\nWe have added the memory and time cost comparison between LoRA fine-tuning and LoRA with post-hoc Laplace-LoRA in Section 5.4 and Table 5 in the main text.  The upshot is that the dominant additional cost arises from accumulating the low-rank Kronecker factors; that takes about 10\\% of the time, and only slightly more memory memory (actually about 1-5\\% more memory) than the original finetuning run."

That's because there are currently no effective and efficient methods for Bayesian finetuning of modern LLMs.  Here, we show comprehensively that highly efficient Bayesian methods can dramatically improve calibration in modern LLMs.  That's the key novelty in this paper, and it opens the way to practical applications of Bayesian methods in modern LLMs, along with a far more thorough exploration of Bayesian methods for LLMs in future work.\n\nRegarding the novelty of our Laplace-LoRA approach, we believe its significance lies in the innovative integration of well-studied methods to create a novel framework for Bayesian fine-tuning on LLMs. This integration is not trivial and addresses a critical gap in current methodologies. In addition, we opensourced code that works with any publicly available LLMs on Huggingface.\n\n**Methods**\n\nWe have added a Methods section describing the nontrivial methods required for the low-rank K-FAC approach that we designed for Laplace-LoRA, with detailed derivations in Appendix E.\n\n**Autoregressive generation**\n\nGiven that this is the first investigation of Laplace for LoRA fine-tuning, we chose to focus on multiple-choice QA because that allowed us to use robust, well-understood calibrations metrics like ECE and NLL.  \n\nAs a next step, we are indeed excited by the possibility of investigating free-text generation: Laplace-LoRA certainly could be applied in this setting.  However, the development of robust, well-understood calibration metrics for free-text generation remains a challenging and open research question.

The proposed Laplace-LoRA seems to be a scalable solution to enable uncertainty estimation for large models.\n\n- **Good experiment design**: Despite some practical issues (see *weakness*), the experiment was conducted well on six public datasets with several strong baseline methods, in terms of three settings -- 1) early stopping, 2) finetuning with validation, and 3) OOD generalization.

It would also be interesting to compare the proposed method with semantic uncertainty [Kuhn et al., ICLR'23]. \n- **Lack of LLM backbones**: The empirical evidence of the proposed method is somewhat weak due to the lack of more LLM backbones. Some concerns include: 1) can the proposed Laplace-LoRA work with larger model sizes (e.g., 13B, 70B)? 2) Can Laplace-LoRA be applied to models other than LLaMA2 (e.g., Mistral 7B, GPT-2, etc.)?\n- **Comparison to ensemble**: Besides the checkpoint ensemble, it is also expected to implement a baseline given by the LoRA ensemble (similar to the deep ensemble approach)."
