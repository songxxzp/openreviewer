It then uses two separate text encoders, one for the original input text and one for the extracted structured pairs. The two representations are concatenated and used as a conditioning input to the diffusion denoiser.\n* The paper also proposes a data synthesis method that produces paired audio-text samples that are temporally aligned in the audio and text content. Audio samples from other datasets that have single event labels as tags are mixed and concatenated using simple templates. A corresponding diverse audio caption is also synthesized using an LLM by feeding it the individual event information.\n* A secondary contribution is a 1D CNN based audio encoder and Transformer based Diffusion model that is supposed to provide better results on variable length generation.\n* Experimental results on Audiocaps and Clotho show that the proposed method can provide better numbers on the metrics meant for evaluating audio generation."

It is not clear why the IS metric is suitable for measuring temporal alignment. \n* The experimental results provides an analysis of the proposed method as any other general audio generation method. This is necessary but not sufficient to justify the claims on improving temporal consistency.\n* The section on variable length generation, 1D CNN based audio encoding and Transformer diffusion model is very confusing. \n* The 1D CNN\u2019s latent representation is still a 2D tensor where there is subsampling in the mel-channels dimension. The only difference is that it is a single channel 2D tensor. A 1D CNN\u2019s output should typically be a 1D vector for a single channel.\n* It is not clear how the combination of 1D CNN audio encoding and Transformer diffuser is better for variable length generation i.e. what aspect of it is making it suitable for variable length output. The model doesn\u2019t seem to be an autoregressive model, hence, it is still trained and inferred with fixed lengths."

For longer audio clips, it is not clear for me why they opt for a structure that only supports 3 temporal positions: start, end, and all.\n2. This sentence is not clear: \"Additionally, 2D spatial structures widely used in T2A works lead to unsatisfactory audio quality when generating variable-length audio samples since they do not adequately prioritize temporal information.\" What do you mean by \"they do not adequately prioritize temporal information\"? and I don't understand how it is related to \"variable-length\" audio.\n3. Reproducibility: Although the method to generate the dataset is clearly described, The subsystems are not clearly described, which makes reproducing the result very hard, especially in Section 3.5 \u00a0(see the next point).\n4. Section 3.5 is not clear at all:\n   1. The 1D-convolution-based audio encoder\u2019s latent is \u00a0of the shape C_a/f_1 X T/f_2 . It's not clear how \u00a0the 1D convolution results in\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0this shape, is there no channels dimension, or are you just pooling over time and frequency?\n   2. The complexity calculation is not clear: \"Compared to the original spatial transformer, the computation complexity reduces from O( (TXF)^2 x D ) to O(T^2 X D)\". It's not clear what happened to the frequency dimension; was it merged into the latent features D? I also think the related work uses only U-nets so to what models are you comparing exactly here?\n5. Evaluation:\n   1. \u00a0Since the main motivation of the paper is temporal disorder, I think there should be a comparison with LM-based audio generation (such as AudioLM etc...) where the LM can resolve temporal dependencies.\n   2. Again, since this work addresses mainly temporal disorders, I believe that there should be a clear evaluation of this exact point.\n   3. Can you please explain the evaluation metrics in Section 4.1 clearly (directly) and what they mean when evaluating temporal disorder. I think in its current form, it's ambigious. Additionally, make sure you're using the same evaluation methods (AudioLDM uses a different classifier than AudioGen to calculate the KL)."

The LLM-based data augmentation approach bears some resemblance to the approach presented in the \"make-an-audio\" paper [1]. It might be valuable to highlight what differentiates the proposed method from the one cited.\n3. In Section 4.4's Table 6, the 1D VAE and FFT diffusion seem to be the primary contributors to the observed performance enhancement. It might be worth discussing how the other combined design elements factor into this performance boost.\n[1] Huang, R., Huang, J., Yang, D., Ren, Y., Liu, L., Li, M., ... & Zhao, Z. (2023).

It remains unclear how the proposed method compared to the approaches proposed in Make-An-Audio.\n- The authors claim state-of-the-art performance for text-to-audio synthesis while the proposed systems are only evaluated on AudioCaps and Clotho, which are both rather noisy.

Isn't the original model convolution-based?\n- (Section 4.1) What's the difference between MOS-F and MOS-T?\n- (Table 1) What's the standard errors for the MOS? It's hard to make any conclusions without error bars. Also, were all these baseline models trained on AudioCaps?\n- (Section 4.1) \"We reimplement Make-An-Audio and train it on AudioCaps Dataset.\" -> I don't believe this is how Make-An-Audio was trained? Did you apply the augmentation technique proposed in Make-An-Audio? Also, it becomes a unfair comparison when your model is trained on a larger dataset than Make-An-Audio. In my understanding, Make-An-Audio is the most relevant system that we should compare TETA to, so please clarify how you reimplemented Make-An-Audio for a fair comparison.\n- (Section 4.2) I didn't get the idea of using IS to measure temporal alignment. Is this a standard metric to measure temporal alignment? What's the intuition and rationale behind this?\n- (Section 4.2) What's the mean/median/stddev of audio length for Clotho-eval-variable? Some statistics of the length will be helpful here. It's unclear to me whether this means generating shorter or longer audio.\n- (Table 2 & 3) Should compare with Make-An-Audio. These models are not built and trained for temporally compositional audio generation.\n- (Section 4.3) What are the vocoders used in the comparison in Table 1? How can we disentangle the effects of vocoders from the synthesis model? Are FD values comparable among models -- are they using the same parameters for mel spectrogram computation?\n- (Section 4.4) When we tried to train them with variable-length data. They don't converge to a good result, the results even deteriorate when tested in AudioCaps and Clotho dataset.\n\nHere are some other comments and suggestions:\n\n- The format of citations are confusing. Please use parentheses when appropriate. For example, the citations in the first line of introduction should be parenthesized.\n- (Section 3.1) \"ensuring extremely faithful...\" -> \"extremely\" is not a proper word to be used in a scientific paper\n- (Section 3.4) \"Then we randomly select N \u2208 {2, 3} samples from D, mix and concatenate them at random.\" -> One of the problems of such artificially created mixture is the inconsistency of sound characteristics in different component sounds such as reverberations and microphone quality.\n- (Section 3.4) \"we bind them with start, mid or end depending ...\" -> This offers a poor time resolution. It remains unclear how this method can be scaled up to long-form audio generation.\n- (Section 3.5) \"Furthermore, the use of a 2D-convolution layer and spatial transformer-stacked U-Net architecture limits the model's ability to generate variable-length\naudio.\" -> Not sure why this is the case. I believe UNets can generate the desired output length if you can provide a noise sequence of the same length. Please provide more supporting evidence for your argument.\n- (Section 4.1) \"This results in a dataset composed of 0.92 million audio text pairs, ...\" -> From this I assume there is an intense filtering involved during the preprocessing since AudioSet has 2M samples and is rather noisy. Please include some descriptions on the data cleaning approach in the main text as it is  a critical step.\n- (Section 4.2) AudioCaps and Clotho are both noisy datasets, so FD and FAD doesn't necessarily measure the audio quality. Moreover, I believe KL doesn't measure the audio quality. CLAP is also known to perform poorly on complex audio with multiple sources and temporal ordering.\n- (Section 5) \"TETA achieves the SOTA audio generation quality in both objective and subjective metrics and extends the boundaries of the T2A.\" -> This is a problematic statement as the authors only evaluated the systems on AudioCaps and Clotho."
