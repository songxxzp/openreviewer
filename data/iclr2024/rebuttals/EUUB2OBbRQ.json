The authors show that GNNs are poorly calibrated when graphs have OOD nodes and lowering the weights of the edges connecting to OOD nodes can improve the calibration. Based on these observations, they propose a method to identify these edges and reweight them automatically through DDPG. Specifically, they design state, action, and reward as edge features, edge weights, and the weighted sum of accuracy and carefully designed entropy. Then, they iteratively sample edges from self-loops to other edges within 2-hop subgraphs while computing reward at each step. In experiments, they show that their algorithm can improve calibration in various datasets and detect OOD nodes well."

The existing calibration methods are less effective on graphs with OOD nodes as they do not consider the negative impact of OOD nodes. The proposed framework incorporates reinforcement learning (RL) to learn new edge weights that can adjust the entropy of the output from GNNs and mitigate the calibration issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the RNGER framework can effectively calibrate GNNs and achieve comparable accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The learned edge weights are also transferable and beneficial in other graph learning tasks."

As stated in Intro and Related Work, there are some previous works focus on OOD nodes. The shortcomings of existing works are not well discussed in this paper, and the experimental results do not show significantly better results than existing works(e.g. On Cora, Citeseer and Amazon-Computers, baselines outperform the proposed method).\n4. Proposed algorithm needs to compute 2-hop edges, which makes the time complexity unacceptable and limits its potenial for real-world large graphs.\n5.
