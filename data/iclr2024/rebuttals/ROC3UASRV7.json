This type of algorithm learns a classifier on the domain that predicts optimality, and alternates between updating that classifier and updating the best solution found so far. The paper has two main contributions: 1) a novel learning theoretical analysis and 2) a modification of an existing algorithm with better learning bounds achieved by shrinking the region where the best solution may be found so far. Experiments on DFO benchmarks and LLMs show that the proposed algorithm RACE-CARS improves over the modified algorithm SRACOS and CMA-ES (which is computationally expensive). Ablations of the hyperparameters are also done."

We have reorganized the manuscript and supplemented more experiments, the new manuscript will release soon.\n\n# Answer to Q1:\n\nThanks for your suggestions. Proof framework utilizing shattering rate removes the issue that computational complexity overflows the upper-bound. However, we cannot assert that the new upper bound is tight, since black-box functions are quite intricate. Meanwhile, we didn't make proofs about tightness. Nevertheless, the new bound is tighter in the more desirable cases, such as the counterexample we proposed.\n\n# Answer to Q2:\n\nFor computational complexity upper bounds on function evaluations, you can refer to Theorem 3.1 and 3.2, for SRACOS and RACE-CARS respectively. As for numerical computation, neither SRACOS nor RACE-CARS involves matrix computation, the training and replacing sub-procedures consist of assignment operations and uniform sampling. You can refer to (Liu et al., 2017; 2019b.) for more running time comparisons or try code package in supplementary material if you interest. The only different operation of RACE-CARS is region shrinking, which consist of $4n$ boolean and assignment operations, the additional computational complexity can even be neglected.\n\n# Answer to Q3:\n\nGenerally, BO is a good choice for functions with less oscillation in low dimension, but it fails in handerds dimensions (Bickel  Levina, 2004; Hall et al., 2005; Fan  Fan, 2008). In addition, randomly embedding BO was selected as a baseline in (Qian et al., 2016a;b; Hu et al., 2017), for RACOS and SRACOS respectively, and has been proven worse than baseline in our experiments. These are the reasons why we didn't try BO. We mentioned at footnote 2 in page 8, that DE and ZO-Adam are poor performed and we excluded these baselines in LLM for concision and explicit comparisons."

As a result, the term  $\\frac{1}{| \\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  |}  $ in the complexity bound  equals to  $\\frac{1}{| \\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  |} =  (\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^n $, which grows exponentially for $\\epsilon < 1$. \n\n2. $\\textbf{Impractical Assumptions}$\n\n The Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption in Definition 3.1 together with the $\\gamma$-Shrinking assumption in Definition 2.3 are too strong to be practical.  The Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption requires the classifier prediction to have at least a $\\eta$ overlap with the true $\\epsilon$-solution domain $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $.   In the above example,  the size of $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $ decay exponentially w.r.t. the dimension $n$ , which requires the classifier to be very accurate or to have high positive prediction percentage ($h(x) =1$). \n\nIn addition, $\\gamma$-Shrinking assumption requires the region of the positive prediction to have a $\\gamma$-shrinking for all $t$.  As a result, the region of the positive prediction exponentially decays w.r.t. $t$,  i.e., $\\gamma^t$.  However, the  Hypothesis-Target  $\\eta$-Shattering assumption requires to have at least a $\\eta$ overlap with the true $\\epsilon$-solution domain $\\Omega  _ {\\epsilon}  $,  which requires a very strong classifier for high-dimensional problems. However, how to achieve a  strong classifier with limited training samples for high-dimensional problems is challenging.  \n\n3. $\\textbf{No Convergence Guarantee}$.\n\nThe complexity analysis can not guarantee convergence as $t$ tends to infinity.   In Theorem 3.3, the left-hand side of the inequality decays exponentially fast w.r.t $t$. However,  the RHS of the inequality can not guarantee an exponential decay. \n\n4.

We have reorganized the manuscript and supplemented more experiments, the new manuscript will release soon.\n\n# Answer to Q1:\n\n## Exponentially Growing Complexity Bound\n\nIn order to prove universal acceleration, upper bounds in Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 are established only on the non-zero-measure assumption for objective $f.$ Consequently, the established bounds are inevitable to compromise for certain extreme objective functions. This compromise is quite common in convergence rate analysis. For instance, when we are talking about first order optimization algorithms for L-smooth objectives, the best convergence rate for convex functions is sublinear while for strongly convex functions is linear. As far as the authors' knowledge, for black-box objectives without additional assumption, curse of dimensionality is unavoidable. Fortunately, as Corollary 1 and 2 in Yu et al. (2016) show, the complexity upper bound of RACOS is polynomial about dimensionality $n$ (which we mentioned in introduction) when the objective is locally Holder continuous (the objective is not even point-wise continuous according to the definition), let alone the acceleration to SRACOS. In addition, in terms of the 4 Holder continuous synthetic functions, empirical results in appendix show the convergence complexity increases linearly w.r.t. dimensionality.\n\n## Impractical Assumptions\n\n+ Firstly, it is true that $\\gamma$-shrinking assumption is to some extent irrational. But it is used in the former studies and is no longer needed in this paper. Rethinks of its plausibility is one of the reasons why we propose to shrink the region proactively.\n\n+ Secondly, hypothesis-target $\\eta$-shattering assumption coincides with error-target $\\theta$-dependence. It can be proven that $\\eta>0$ as long as $\\theta<1-\\mathbb{P}(R_t)$, meaning that our new assumption is at least not stronger than former studies. Moreover, the mechanism of training sub-procedure, i.e., RACOS in former studies, has shown the ability to maintain error-target $\\theta$-dependence for small $\\theta,$ in other words $\\eta$-overlap with $\\Omega_\\epsilon.$ In fact, the trained classifier at each iteration entails to encompass as much proportion of true solution as possible, i.e.,  being more precise rather than being strong or accurate. RACOS itself is a radical training method, therefore satisfying the assumption is not bothering.\n\n+ Lastly, the proposed DFO algorithm requires application-dependent hyper-parameters tuning. Introduction of supplementary hyper-parameters, which is reasonable for black-box exploration given the \"no free lunch\" theorem, indicates a concrete direction towards applicable DFO algorithms. In the present study, we address hyper-parameters selection from a practical perspective (see Discussion 5.2). Consolidation of the proposed theoretical analysis is considered as an important direction for our future works.\n\n## No Convergence Guarantee\n\nTo be frank, Theorem 3.3 plays as a sufficient but not necessary condition for Theorem 3.2, introducing a theoretic concept shrinking factor $\\gamma^{n\\rho}$ for empirical hyper-parameters tuning, rather than a convergence conclusion of the proposed algorithm. It is not trivial to establish a sufficient and necessary condition of Theorem 3.2, given the complexity of stochastic process coupling $Training$ and $replacing$ sub-procedures. However, according to our empirical analysis, region shrinking does not jeopardize the convergence of algorithm as long as hyper-parameters are well selected (see Discussion 5.2). Moreover, even an extremely conservative selection of hyper-parameters, i.e., $\\gamma^\\rho$ is extremely close to 1, achieves acceleration to SRACOS.\n\n# Answer to Q2:\n\nExperiments on other datasets have been updated. We will release the new manuscript soon. Please wait patiently.\n\n# Answer to Q3:\n\nThe training sub-procedure RACOS outputs hypotheses $h_t$ with cubic positive region, and after orthogonal projection the positive region of new hypothesis $\\tilde{h}_t$ is also cubic. Therefore, sampling $(x_t, y_t)\\sim \\mathbf{Y}_t$ is coordinate-wise uniform sampling, making it negligible compared with function evaluation."

                        "value": "Thanks for your kind comments and suggestion.\n\n# Answer to Weakness: \n\nJust as you mentioned, the upper bound of SRACOS and RACE-CARS, i.e., Theorem 3.1 and Theorem 3.2 respectively, are established both under the assumption of $\\eta$-shattering rather than dimensionally local Holder continuity. In our paper, Theorem 3.3 gives a lower bound of $\\gamma^\\rho$ to maintain the same shattering rate of ``RACE-CARS'' and SRACOS, playing as a theoretical guidance for hyper-parameters selection when the objective is dimensionally locally Holder continuous. However, the generality of RACE-CARS is not less than SRACOS, we list the reasons below:\n+ We adopt dimensionally locally Holder continuous as assumption for mathematical considerations, with which $\\eta$-shattering can be simplified analytically. RACE-CARS achieves acceleration to SRACOS as long as $\\eta>0,$ rather than limited in Holder continuous situation.\n+ From practical standpoint, neither of the upper bounds of SRACOS and RACE-CARS are polynomial about $t,$ whereas Yu et al. (2016) gave a proof saying that RACOS converges to an $\\epsilon$-solution in polynomial time when the objective is locally Holder continuous. Therefore, assumption for sufficient conditions in Theorem 3.3 is in line with what SRACOS needs.\n+ Assumption on dimensionally local Holder continuity is a weakened equivalence to condition $|\\Omega_\\epsilon|>0$ for all $\\epsilon>0.$ The latter one is needed to avoid discontinuity at global minima, such as the case $f(x)=0$ when $x=0$ otherwise $f(x)=1,$  which is literally impossible to solve with DFO algorithms. Additionally, according to the Definition 3.2, dimensionally local Holder continuity implies the objective is upper and lower enveloped by certain continuous functions, while discontinuities can still happen within the region.\n\n# Answer to Question: \n\nAs aforementioned, point-wise continuity is not necessary for RACE-CARS in theoretical viewpoint, whereas without which DFO methods with gradient estimator may fail. Nevertheless, we appreciate the inspiring suggestions, we have supplemented experiments on discontinuous objectives, the new manuscript will release soon."
