I believe DiffSim is designed to enable flexible binding docking. Perhaps it would be beneficial to incorporate visualization features that display protein changes, such as side chain alterations, during the process.\n5. Also, what is the pocket RMSD? or if you just use holo protein/pocket as initial docking?\n5. It might be valuable to include a discussion on the time efficiency of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in this stage, particularly in the context of protein MD.\n\n[1] Xu, Minkai, et al. \"GeoDiff: A Geometric Diffusion Model for Molecular Conformation Generation.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2021."

More specifically, Langevin dynamics sample from an Boltzmann distribution under the energy function, while intermediate reverse diffusion steps sample from a Gaussian, changing as $t$ evolves.

We appreciate your insights and the references you provided for further discussions in terms of the connection between MD and diffusion.\n\nThe step-wise bounding approach may not be optimal. In light of your feedback, we are delving deeper into the literature and consider theoretically compatible approaches to aligning reverse diffusion and MD trajectories, taking into account the differences in sampling distributions.\n\nOnce again, we express our gratitude for your time and effort in reviewing our paper."

The key ideas are:\n\n- DiffSim integrates a diffusion-based generative model with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to combine their strengths.\n- It aligns the reverse diffusion sampling process with MD trajectories using a novel loss function.\n- An active learning approach selectively chooses training samples for MD simulation.\n- Theoretical analysis shows consistency in dynamics between diffusion models and MD, making DiffSim a reasonable hybrid.\n- DiffSim outperforms previous blind docking methods on standard RMSD and centroid distance metrics."

Such as, E3Bind, https://openreview.net/forum?id=sO1QiAftQFv, FABind, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06763.\n- Computational efficiency comparison to alternatives would be helpful. It is necessary to give computational comparison since MD is usually cost, while diffusion with many steps are also cost. \n- The experimental results are not good as expected, which leads to a negative view of the effectiveness of the method."
