It is well-motivated, clearly written, well-organized and rather complete. \n\nI like the focus on real social interactions, the careful design to promote a diversity of testing scenarios along several axes and the careful definition of the evaluation protocol. This framework appears easy to extend with more complex interactive scenarios (eg multi-player) and more evaluation dimensions, which makes it very useful. \n\nThe study of GPT-4's ability to conduct evaluations is interesting. It appears that its capacity to do so is currently limited, but it's good to have a methodology to measure it, so future work can improve on it and measure these improvements reliably. \n\nThe paper consistently answered questions I had while reading earlier paragraphs, which is a pretty good sign of the quality of its structure."

                    "value": "I don't have many weaknesses to point at, but there is a couple of small things that could improve the paper. \n\nI'm not sure the paper clearly states the result of the study of GPT4's ability to evaluate interactions. The results seem to say that GPT4 is rather good at evaluating the goal dimensions and 2 others when it comes to the behavior of other models, but the paper then states \u201cPutting these observations together, we conclude that, with some caution, GPT-4 can be used as a proxy to human judgments for evaluating model performance on most dimensions and for human performance on the GOAL dimension.\u201d --> is 3/7 'most'?\n\nIt sounds to me that it's not bad but also not working so well. Should we use it? Probably not. The authors point out possible biases that might interfere with the ratings, but since they are not studied here it's hard to tell where and when they might play. I think this is fine to say it's not ready yet, but argue that the evaluation protocol is a strong contribution that will help us track progress in that direction. For this reason, I think the authors should commit to release the dataset of interactions between models and human judgments so it can be used as training/testing data to support further research in developing better automated evaluations approaches. \n\nMore generally, since it's a benchmark paper, it should be written somewhere what will be released publicly. Ideally we'd like to see a release of: 1) the codebase to run these experiments, 2) an easy to use way to plug a new language models, define other models it could interact with to get the final (automatic) evaluation score, 3) interaction data across models and with humans, 4) human judgments, 5) GPT4 judgements;; basically all code and data. Please be explicit as to what will or will not be released. The quality of this work will be directly correlated to the amount of things released that can be useful for others. Indeed, benchmark papers that don't release anything are pretty useless. \n\nThe discussion of limitations should probably be part of the main paper and not hidden in the appendix. \n\nCould you provide an estimate of the number of calls made to the API and the resulting costs? It's interesting to see what budget these kind of experiments lead to. Eg: how much would it cost to evaluate a given agent in SOTOPIA using GPT4 evaluation? etc.\n\nMinor comments:\n* \u201cIn the following paragraphs, we itemize all seven dimensions in SOTOPIA, each with a score range in [lower bound\u2013upper bound] form, the explanation, and the literature inspire us.\u201d \u2192 grammar issue in the end of the sentence\n* Table 2: \u201cThe best performance for each dimension is bolded when significant.\u201d \u2192significant does not mean much in itself. What is significant here? The null hypothesis (difference in means? medians? two-by-two?), the level of confidence and the statistical tests used should be stated.\n* couple of typos here and there"

Since LLM answers are longer and always repeat the previous point, humans might guess it's an AI and we know humans usually have a negative AI bias that could lead to different behaviors in both cases. eg: do humans perform higher again humans or gpt4 and is this simply due to the quality of the other player or to a negative AI bias? Could you reproduce this effect by asserting that the other player is AI or human whereas it's always an AI?\n\n* Why is there a gap in Table 1 (human + sec)\n\n* why not normalize and rescale measures between 0-1 to make the table easier to read?\n\n* Why is the pairwise performance in Figure 3 not symmetric?\n\n* It would be interesting to study how robust are humans / AI to adversarial humans trying to get them to score lower on the benchmark dimensions. I'd expect AI to be quite sensitive to human behavior in these interactions and to be thrown off quite easily. \n\n* It would be interesting to discuss how to make LLM better on this benchmarks. eg suggesting that we could run these interactions, evaluated them with GPT4, then finetune the model on successful interactions, repeat that and see how performance improves with iterations?\n\nConclusion of the review: I think this paper is very good and will be a good basis for future research IF most things are released. I condition the score I'm giving now on the author adding a statement listing what will be released publicly."

                        "value": "We are happy the reviewer felt that our work *makes an interesting contribution towards the robust assessment of LLMs' social capabilities* and our carefully designed framework *appears easy to extend with more complex interactive scenarios (eg multi-player) and more evaluation dimensions, which makes it very useful*.\n\nWe also appreciate the exciting future research questions asked in the reviews, which show the potential of SOTOPIA facilitating a line of research centering on social interactions.\n\n\n### Bringing Limitations to Main Paper\nWe agree that it would be best to move the discussion of limitations from the appendix to the main paper. We will try to fit it into the space constraints.\n\n### Clarifications on Typos and Cost Estimates\nThanks for pointing out the typos, we will fix them. Running evaluation over one episode would on average have 2k input tokens and 500 output tokens. As of the current GPT-4's price (https://openai.com/pricing), it would cost around 0.09 to evaluate one episode, therefore, it would cost around 0.09*900=\\$81 to use GPT-4 to evaluate a given agent.\n\n ### GPT4's ability to evaluate social interactions\nThe results are somewhat mixed, GPT-4 is good in some dimensions (esp. The goal). And apologies, yes, \u201cmost\u201d is not accurate; we changed it to \u201csome\u201d in our updated version. Also, note that the correlation (Table 1) between GPT-4 and human judgment belongs to instance-level correlation while Figure 2 shows the system-level correlation which indicates GPT-4 still provides an evaluation that can be cautiously applied and offers insights into models\u2019 overall social intelligence (this is further demonstrated in the appendix Table F.1, where human evaluation shows the same trend as GPT-4 when comparing models\u2019 performance.)\n\n### Comprehensive Release Plan\nYes, we have all of these ready to be released upon acceptance:\n1) the codebase to run these experiments.\n2) an easy-to-use way to plug new language models, and define other models it could interact with to get the final (automatic) evaluation score. Our API supports both locally hosted and 3rd party models. \n3) interaction data across models and with humans.\n4) human judgments.\n5) GPT4 judgments.\n\n### Q&A\n * *\u201cIt could be interesting to have studies that vary single dimensions of the interactive tasks at a time and see the impact on the various evaluation metrics: eg simply vary the relationship between the two players, or vary one personality traits; or vary the goal etc. Does each variation lead in the expected shift in the conversation?\u201d*\n\nYes, we plan to carry on the future study on that topic. After analyzing the existing episodes, we find both variations in personality and gender can influence the completion of goals. Specifically, There is a statistically significant increase in goal completion for personas that have higher openness, which is reflected in some physiology literature [1]. Though out of the scope of this project, it is an exciting direction to use Sotopia as the social simulation platform to study various social science problems.\n \n[1] Gatzka, Thomas. 2021. \u201cAspects of Openness as Predictors of Academic Achievement.\u201d Personality and Individual Differences 170 (February): 110422."

Could you reproduce this effect by asserting that the other player is AI or human whereas it's always an AI?\u201d*\n\nIn our human study, we randomly pair humans with other humans or LLM agents and deliberately tell humans that they could have been paired with humans or AI. We interviewed human annotators in the end and some of the time they could not disambiguate whether the interlocutor was a human or AI. Due to the limitation of our IRB project scope, we cannot deceive humans by telling them they are always talking to AIs (or always talking to humans) when it is not always the case. But this is an interesting question: would humans behave differently when they think they are talking with AI vs humans. \n\n * *\u201cWhy is there a gap in Table 1 (human + sec)\u201d*\n\nThe gap in Table 1 emphasizes that GPT-4's performance varies when evaluating human-involved interactions.\n\n* *\u201cwhy not normalize and rescale measures between 0-1 to make the table easier to read?\u201d*\n\nThe choice of our specific evaluation scale is based on its ability to convey nuanced \nsemantic meanings, noted in footnote 2, which we will further clarify.\n\n* *\u201cWhy is the pairwise performance in Figure 3 not symmetric?\u201d*\n\nBecause we report the performance of each model when interacting with a partner model. A\u2019s performance when interacting with B is different from B\u2019s performance when interacting with A. \n\n* *\u201cIt would be interesting to study how robust are humans / AI to adversarial humans trying to get them to score lower on the benchmark dimensions. I'd expect AI to be quite sensitive to human behavior in these interactions and to be thrown off quite easily.\u201d*\n\nThe idea of examining how AI and humans react to adversarial interactions is interesting. This study could provide valuable insights into the resilience of AI systems in complex social environments. We are excited to pursue this line of research, which could reveal critical aspects of AI robustness and inform future developments in the field.\n\n* *\u201cIt would be interesting to discuss how to make LLM better on this benchmarks. eg suggesting that we could run these interactions, evaluated them with GPT4, then finetune the model on successful interactions, repeat that and see how performance improves with iterations?\u201d*\n\nWe are actively working on methods to improve LLM performance on these benchmarks. Your suggestion of iterative fine-tuning aligns with our current research direction. We aim to not only improve performance but also to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive successful interactions. This iterative approach could offer valuable insights into the evolving capabilities of LLMs in complex social contexts!"

We appreciate your questions that indeed highlight crucial aspects of our work, and we are happy to address them. \n\n### How SOTOPIA addresses the limitations of the previous benchmarks for social intelligence and how they relate:\n\n1. The current benchmarks, such as SocialIQA, primarily consist of descriptive interactions paired with question-and-answer (QA) sets. In these cases, the model doesn't engage in real-time interactions. In contrast, Sotopia introduces a dynamic approach. It evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) within a first-person interactive framework, allowing for direct engagement. This marks a significant shift from the static nature of existing benchmarks to a more dynamic and interactive evaluation environment in Sotopia.\n2. With the rapid development of LLMs, some of the benchmarks gradually become saturated. While there are new adversarial benchmarks to evaluate social intelligence, which are harder than their predecessors, they still lack the dynamic nature of social interactions and the rich social context, which is deemed insufficient for evaluating social intelligence in AI systems [1].\n3. Our work is indeed inspired by several benchmarks and datasets in social intelligence, such as SocialIQA, Persona Chat, and others. For instance, many of our scenarios come from SocialIQA, and our character design is inspired by Persona Chat (see more details in Appendix B.2 Scenarios)\n4. While our current focus is on evaluation rather than the improvement of agents\u2019 social intelligence, we acknowledge the importance of the latter. We have ongoing work using SOTOPIA to enhance social intelligence in AI agents and there is likely a correlation between doing better at SocialIQA and being a better interaction agent.\n\n[1] Lee, Mina, Megha Srivastava, Amelia Hardy, John Thickstun, Esin Durmus, Ashwin Paranjape, Ines Gerard-Ursin, et al. 2023. \u201cEvaluating Human-Language Model Interaction.\u201d Transactions on Machine Learning Research. https://openreview.net/pdf?id=hjDYJUn9l1."

We'd like to emphasize that our metrics do draw on multiple pieces of literature from these domains, as well as economics. Specifically: Goal Completion (Weber, 1978), Believability (Joseph, 1994; Park et al., 2023a), Knowledge (Reiss, 2004; Maslow, 1943), Secret (Reiss, 2004), Relationship  (Maslow, 1943; Benabou & Tirole, 2006), Social Rules (Maslow, 1943), and Financial and Material Benefits (Gilpin & Sandholm, 2006; Burns et al., 2017). We believe that these were already described in some detail in Section 3 in the submitted draft, but we would be happy for any suggestions about how to make this more clear. Since these metrics are based on multiple disciplines, similar concepts are often defined under different names. We unify similar concepts from different domains by giving them a new definition that is compatible with most of the existing definitions and SOTOPIA scenarios."

This paper shows that GPT-4\u2019s evaluation of social interactions is similar to the human evaluation scores. The authors performed experiments on several LLMs accompanied by human evaluations in the SOTOPIA-EVAL framework. The results show that GPT-4 performed best among most dimensions compared with other LLMs. But when evaluating on SOTOPIA-hard tasks, GPT-4 still falls short of human performance in terms of goal completion rate and struggles to demonstrate social commonsense reasoning and strategic communication skills. Based on these findings, the authors suggest that SOTOPIA can serve as a valuable tool for assessing the social interaction abilities of both human and model agents."

So it is unclear whether the evaluation using GPT-4 is biased or not.\n- SOTOPIA-EVAL introduces a multi-dimensional framework that utilizes different scores with hand-crafted ranges. However, there is no quantitive explanation/definition for those metrics. According to the prompts, only the positive/negative and higher scores are described, so the scores are not presented to the LLMs like the Likert scale presented to human evaluations and appear to be heuristic in nature. \n- Some of the evaluation metrics are not really related to social intelligence.

However, in scenarios involving agent-to-agent or agent-to-human interactions, the related aspects, e.g. completion of goals and financial benefits, are also evaluated by GPT-4 or other LLMs. This raises a significant concern as the content of the generated scenarios is already present in the training data. So it is unclear whether the evaluation using GPT-4 is biased or not.\"*\n\nWe acknowledge this is an important issue when evaluating large language models. We have carefully considered the issues of potential bias throughout our framework and experiment design.\n\n###  *If you are asking whether GPT-4 would significantly prefer its own output during evaluation*\n\nThis may be a factor, but it does not change our main conclusions as those are corroborated by human evaluations. In addition to GPT-4 based evaluation Table 2 and 3, we have human-annotated evaluation results in Table F.1 and F.2, and they show similar trends. Putting these together with results in Table 1, we can conclude that GPT-4 based evaluation is a reasonable indication of models\u2019 performance on SOTOPIA tasks. In addition, for future evaluations using SOTOPIA, it is also possible to reproduce our human evaluation protocol, so we can re-examine our assumptions about the correlation between human and machine evaluation as more competitive non-GPT-4 models are released. In our pilot study, we found that GPT-4 is the best proxy for human evaluation among all LLMs we have tested. We are conducting more rigorous experiments to evaluate other models\u2019 correlations with human judgments. We will update our revision as soon as we get the results. \n\n### *If you are asking about biases related to scenarios being more \"in-domain\" for GPT-4 than other models*\n\nWe not only use templates to steer GPT-4\u2019s output, but also manually inspect and correct the generated scenarios and goals. As such, the language distribution of our diverse scenarios significantly deviates from GPT-4's most probable language distribution [1]. Furthermore, the complexity of the task also depends on the partner agent during the interactions (Section 2.1). We will clarify this in the paper.\n\nWe are not sure what the reviewer is referring to with \"the generated content being present in the training data.\" For the reviewer's point about the generated content possibly being present in the training data: we would clarify that we do not train any models in our work. If the reviewer is pointing out that generated scenarios might reflect GPT-4's training data: we verified that our scenarios are novel generations and are not present in the public web corpora that we could browse (we searched for our scenarios through n-gram matching with https://wimbd.apps.allenai.org/  in OpenWebText, C4, OSCAR, The Pile, LAION-2B-en and found 0% of them in there, while we don't know what GPT-4 is trained on, these datasets are representative of data used to train LLMs), so we have very little reason to believe that they are in the training data of GPT4 or any other language model. We will discuss this in our paper.\n\n[1] Kim, Hyunwoo, Jack Hessel, Liwei Jiang, Peter West, Ximing Lu, Youngjae Yu, Pei Zhou, et al. 2022. \u201cSODA: Million-Scale Dialogue Distillation with Social Commonsense Contextualization.\u201d EMNLP 2023"

And we would like to point out that previous work has demonstrated that LLMs can be effectively used for annotating subjective social tasks. [1].\nWhile there are inherent challenges in rating social interactions, our human eval shows that GPT-4 provides an evaluation for models that aligns with human annotations at the system level (Table F.1). \nThank you very much for the suggestion of making the prompts more fine-grained. We agree that this is a good idea, and so we ran some experiments where the evaluator is additionally provided with the descriptions of quantitive definitions for each range of the scale (e.g., *Relationship Deteriorates (-5 to -3): Scores from -5 to -3 indicate that the relationship is deteriorating. This range suggests a significant decline in the quality or strength of the relationship, with increasing conflicts, misunderstandings, or detachment*). However, this unfortunately did not result in a significant difference and if anything the correlation with humans became slightly worse (see the table below). We also encourage future work to further improve the evaluation based on our human annotation, which will be publicly available upon acceptance.\n\n|                   | SEC  | KNO  | SOC  | BEL  | REL  | FIN  | GOAL |\n|-------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Original Pearson R| 0.22 | 0.33 | 0.33 | 0.45 | 0.56 | 0.62 | 0.71 |\n| + Fine-grained Description Pearson R | 0.03 | 0.33 | 0.33 | 0.35 | 0.57 | 0.57 | 0.71 |\n\n\n[1] Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?\nCaleb Ziems, William Held, Omar Shaikh, Jiaao Chen, Zhehao Zhang and Diyi Yang\nComputational Linguistics, 2023"

The former, for example, led us to include, \"believability\" as a dimension needed specifically to measure AI social intelligence: it captures not only conversation naturalness but also the agent's character consistency (i.e., whether they remain \"in-character\" and consistent with their prompted persona); this is a critical shortcoming in many social AI systems  [1] that needs to be measured. This contrasts with **humans**, where persona consistency is less of a concern because most humans naturally have their own consistent persona. As for social rules, this dimension is not about just recalling rules, but about measuring whether AI agents can successfully follow or apply the *relevant* rules during the interactions, which often tends to be challenging in many social settings [2].\n\n\n[1] Shuster, Kurt, Jack Urbanek, Arthur Szlam, and Jason Weston. 2022. \u201cAm I Me or You?

Note that these categories overlap. We will include this distribution in the paper.\n\n*\"The framework and the evaluation mainly focus on two agents. It is not trivial to extend the interaction and evaluation to multi-agent coordination. How can we scale the interaction and evaluation to more complex social scenarios?\"*\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that extending Sotopia to multi-agent (>2 agent) scenarios is an interesting topic that future work should explore. From a practical perspective, SOTOPIA, built on the PettingZoo framework, could support interactions among multiple agents. The only additional feature required would be managing turn-taking, which could be done via a number of methods, such as bidding [1]. Evaluating multi-dimensional social intelligence for each character in multi-agent scenarios can be trivially conducted in SOTOPIA.\n\n[1] Selfridge, Ethan O., and Peter A.

For training data, I meant \"the generated content being present in the training data.\" It will be helpful to include this discussion in the paper. I will update my rating to reflect this part.\n\nMy main concern is the evaluation using GPT-4. The correlation computed between human evaluations and GPT-4 evaluations doesn't consider the absolute values of the rating. So a positive correlation can still show that GPT-4 favors GPT-generated text. Table F.1 and F.2 also show that GPT-4 scores are higher than the human range in SEC and SOC dimensions (the scores are more in the human score range in REL and FIN dimensions). In SODA's supplemental material \"Automatic Evaluation via GPT-4\", they also discussed that \"GPT-4 tends to favor GPT-generated texts over those written by humans\" so the evaluation may be potentially biased. We can use the GPT-4 evaluation to show the relative strength of each dimension of an agent but it may not be an optimization target for a new model and be used to replace human evaluation. I would appreciate if the authors could share a more rigorous analysis to show how GPT-4 is biased or not biased in the evaluation and if it is biased, what we can do to calibrate the evaluation."

We acknowledge this concern and have conducted various analyses, as well as referenced various previous works, to highlight the possible risks. Specifically, Figure 2 shows the distributional differences between GPT-4 scores and human scores, which indicates *\u201cGPT-4 is more likely to rate higher instead of lower than humans when it disagrees with average human judgment\u201d*.\n\nExpanding on that, we have a more fine-grained breakdown analysis by each social dimension in Appendix Figure F.1/2/3, which further shows the effect of GPT-4 being more lenient than human annotators on machine-generated interactions. Furthermore, we have conducted an in-depth analysis of the biases in GPT-4's evaluations across different models. As shown in the table, interestingly, GPT-4 is actually more lenient to social interactions generated by LLaMa2 and GPT-3.5 compared to those generated by itself. \n\nAs you mentioned, this does not hurt using GPT-4 to *\u201cshow the relative strength of each dimension of an agent\u201d* but rather highlights a limitation in using *\u201cbe an optimization target\u201d* (which is out of the scope of this paper). We would like to further illustrate the importance of human annotation and as an initial step, one can calibrate the GPT-4 evaluation by subtracting the mean differences outlined below. Nevertheless, it's important to note that this remains a complex challenge [1]. We encourage future research to explore the potential of using GPT-4's scores as rewards in further studies.\n\n|       | BEL  | REL | KNO  | SEC  | SOC  | FIN  | GOAL |\n|-------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|------|\n| GPT-4 | 1.44** | 0.13 | 0.56* | 0.17* | 0.32** | 0.13 | 0.88** |\n| GPT-3.5 | 2.18** | 0.21* | 1.06** | 0.11 | 0.50** | 0.25** | 1.48** |\n| Llama2 | 3.43** | 0.05 | 0.91** | 0.24 | 0.56** | 0.14 | 1.13** |\n\nMean = avg_GPT-4_evaluation-avg_human_evaluation  \n\\** means a 0.01 significance level under t-test  \n\\* mean a 0.05 significance level under t-test\n\n[1] Pernot, Pascal and Fabien Cailliez. \u201cA critical review of statistical calibration/prediction models handling data inconsistency and model inadequacy.\u201d Aiche Journal 63 (2016): 4642-4665."
