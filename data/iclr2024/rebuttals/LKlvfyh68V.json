They introduce GUARD, the Generalized Unified SAfe Reinforcement Learning Development Benchmark, which offers several key advantages over existing benchmarks. GUARD provides a versatile framework with a wide variety of RL agents, tasks, and constraint specifications, encompassing a comprehensive range of state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms with self-contained implementations. Moreover, GUARD is highly customizable, allowing researchers to tailor tasks and algorithms to specific needs. Through GUARD, the paper conducts a comparative analysis of state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms across various task settings, establishing essential baselines for future research. The paper also acknowledges future work to address limitations and broaden the spectrum of available task types within GUARD."

GUARD's unique contributions include an extensive and generalized framework encompassing 11 different types of agents, 7 distinct robot locomotion tasks, and 8 safety constraint specifications. Furthermore, it offers a unified platform with comprehensive coverage of 8 state-of-the-art safe RL algorithms, all implemented with a consistent and independent structure. GUARD's high customizability allows researchers to effortlessly tailor robot locomotion testing suites to their specific needs, with self-customizable agents, tasks, and constraints. This approach fosters clean code organization and facilitates the integration of new algorithms, making GUARD a versatile and powerful tool for advancing research in the domain of safe reinforcement learning."

The target cost (which is equal to zero) is not achieved in many experiments, which suggests that the safe algorithms did not learn to be \u201csafe\u201d. I think designing the tasks and tuning the algorithms would be one of the main contributions of this work, but it seems to be lacking.\n\n1. It would be great to provide some details on implementation (apologies if I missed them). For example, it would be good to know if other libraries are being used as the base, e.g., RLLib or torchRL. Also, how to customizable are the algorithms? Can we use Lagrangian TRPO with a safety layer (provided that there are two different types of constraints)?  \n\n1. The choice of TRPO as the base on-policy algorithm may not be the optimal one. It is quite heavyweight and PPO would be preferable at least as an option. Note that it is possible to implement PPO and TRPO in one class as done in the Open AI safety agents. I also recommend implementing Stooke et al 2020 as another baseline, which in my experience works really well.\n\nI appreciate that these weaknesses may seem like minor ones, but I feel it is very important to get these things right the first time. If the authors have better results for the algorithms and the tasks I will consider raising the score."

Specifically the authors consider the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with cumulative constraints. They implement several model-free algorithms CPO (Achiam et al. 2017), TRPO-lagrangian (Bohez et al. 2019), TRPO-FAC (Ma et al. 2021), TRPO-IPO (Lie et al. 2020), PCPO (Yang et al. 2020), including two hierarchical algorithms TRPO-SL (Dalal et al. 2018) and TRPO-USL (Zhang et al. 2022). In addition they provide an unconstrained baseline TRPO (Schulman et al. 2015). \n\nBy equipping each algorithm with the same MLP architecture the authors obtain a fair comparison between all these methods across a number of environments. The environments can be configured with 8 different control robots, over 4 possible task and 3 possible constraint configurations. The authors provide some discussion on the relative complexity of these possible configurations, accompanied by a discussion regarding the performance profile of the different algorithms."

Clearly Safety Gym (Ray et al. 2019) has inspired this work, it would be nice if the 3 robots and 3 environment configurations from Safety Gym were captured by GUARD.\n\n(3) The number of algorithms implemented is far from exhaustive. Of course I don't expect every safe RL algorithm to be implemented, but unfortunately other benchmarks like Safety-Gymnasium (Ji et al. 2023) and Omnisafe (Ji et al. 2023) do have a more comprehensive suite of algorithms available.\n\n(4) Lack of a comprehensive discussion of safe RL and the limitations of considering CMDPs. In the original Safety Gym paper, Ray et al. discuss more broadly safe RL and safe exploration, and where the problem they are trying to adress sits in the literature. They also adress the critiques of CMDP and considering simple cumulative constraints.  It would be nice if a similar discussion of the broader context of this research was present in the paper and how you might adress other problems in the future.\n\nFor these reasons I am not recommending acceptance of the paper. For me the benchmark does seem useful and the novelty of the environments makes the benchmark distinct from similar \"competitors\", for lack of a better word. Issues (1)-(3) are not big issues for me. However, I am reviewing a paper not a benchmark and issue (4) does poses a problem in this instance. Without providing a thoughtful discussion of the broader context of safe RL the paper seems more like a user manual than an interesting and thought provoking read. If the authors adress this weakness I would consider recommending acceptance, since I do see merit in this work."
