                    "value": "This paper introduces the \"Hypotheses-to-Theories\" (HtT) framework, which is designed to equip LLMs with a rule library for conducting reasoning. HtT comprises two distinct stages: an induction stage and a deduction stage. In the induction stage, the LLM is initially tasked with generating and validating rules based on a set of training examples. Rules that frequently appear and lead to correct answers are aggregated to create a rule library. In the deduction stage, the LLM is then prompted to leverage this acquired rule library to engage in reasoning and respond to test questions. The authors have evaluated their approach on a numerical reasoning benchmark and a relational reasoning benchmark and argue that their approach can significantly enhance the performance of existing few-shot prompting methods."

Specifically, I feel that the proposed Hypotheses-to-Theories (HtT) framework \nlacks comprehensive development within this submission. The authors describe general ideas but do not provide sufficient technical details \n  describing how their methods advance the state-of-the-art. The core technical contribution of the paper\nis succinctly described in just one and a half pages (pages 3 and 4), while the majority of the paper \nis devoted to the description of the experiments and the obtained results.  Unfortunately, the description of the approach\n appears somewhat lacking in depth and places an undue emphasis on \"tricks\" like XML tagging, detracting attention from fundamental principles and methodologies that can be adopted and further developed by other researchers.\n\nAs an example of the paper lacking important detail, I feel that the concept of a \"rule\" remains ambiguously defined in the paper. Specifically, the paper lacks an explicit description of the nature of \"rules\" that can be incorporated into the library and subsequently used in the deduction phase. The examples presented in Figure 1 proved to be somewhat confusing; for instance, the rule library in Figure 1 includes statements like \"3 + 4 = 7,\" which, in my view, represent concrete facts rather than rules. A rule typically constitutes a formalised, general statement that applies to a potentially infinite collection of objects (e.g., \"the successor of an even natural number is an odd number\" or \"all men are mortal\"). In this context, the assertion that the proposed approach can induce \"rules\" appears unjustified and potentially misleading.\n\nSimilarly, it remains unclear how these \"rules\" are to be applied. Rule application, in its essence, involves the process of using a general statement to derive new facts from existing information (e.g., given that 4 is an even natural number and the established rule that the successor of an even number is odd, we can deduce the new fact that 5 is an odd number). It remains unclear how a \"rule\" such as \"3 + 4 = 7\" would be employed in a deductive context to generate new insights in the aforementioned sense."

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive comments. We noticed that you didn\u2019t mention any technical problems. If you have additional questions, feel free to let us know before the end of the discussion period. Here is our response to your concerns.\n\n**W1: The authors describe general ideas but do not provide sufficient technical details describing how their methods advance the state-of-the-art. The core technical contribution of the paper is succinctly described in just one and a half pages (pages 3 and 4), while the majority of the paper is devoted to the description of the experiments and the obtained results. Unfortunately, the description of the approach appears somewhat lacking in depth and places an undue emphasis on \"tricks\" like XML tagging, detracting attention from fundamental principles and methodologies that can be adopted and further developed by other researchers.**\n\nA1: HtT is a simple prompting method, where the implementation details are from the standard CoT prompt, the generation and verification of rules on the training set. These can be found in Section 3.1 & 4.1 and appendix A. Specifically, the rules are then filtered by two hyperparameters, minimal occurrence k and minimal accuracy p. Technically, the rules are extracted by regular expressions, but they are not sensitive to the choice of regular expressions. The occurrence of a rule is the number of times that it appears in the intermediate steps of all examples in the training set. The accuracy of a rule is the probability of the LLM reaching the correct answer when the rule occurs. We will follow the reviewer's advice to move part of appendix A to the main text, in order to provide more details and better readability.\n\nXML tagging is a trick to augment the retrieval ability of LLMs without finetuning them on retrieval tasks. Our hypothesis is that it provides the right hint to the transformer attention mechanism and that's how it helps the rule deduction. We will follow the reviewer's advice to better position this with respect to the overall framework.\n\nIn a nutshell, the fundamental principles of this paper is to modify CoT prompts into an induction stage to learn rules and a deduction stage to use rules. We will emphasize this more in the revision.\n\n**W2: I feel that the concept of a \"rule\" remains ambiguously defined in the paper. Specifically, the paper lacks an explicit description of the nature of \"rules\" that can be incorporated into the library and subsequently used in the deduction phase. The examples presented in Figure 1 proved to be somewhat confusing; for instance, the rule library in Figure 1 includes statements like \"3 + 4 = 7,\" which, in my view, represent concrete facts rather than rules. A rule typically constitutes a formalised, general statement that applies to a potentially infinite collection of objects (e.g., \"the successor of an even natural number is an odd number\" or \"all men are mortal\").**\n\nA2: We use the term \u201crules\u201d to refer to any intermediate steps that we can reuse for multi-step reasoning problems. This can be arithmetic rules like \u201c3 + 4 = 7\u201d, propositional logic rules like \u201cfather\u2019s mother is grandmother\u201d, or first-order logic rules like \u201cIf Y is X\u2019s father and Z is Y\u2019s mother, Z is X\u2019s grandmother\u201d. As discussed in Section 2, rules and facts are relative concepts, and every rule can be a fact in a certain context. \u201c3 + 4 = 7\u201d is a rule when we are playing with different base systems, since \u201c3 + 4 = 10\u201d in base-7 and \u201c3 + 4 = 11\u201d in base-6. Of course you can regard \u201c3 + 4 = 7\u201d as a fact when you assume the context is a decimal system.\n\nAs you said, a rule is a general statement that applies to a potentially infinite collection of objects. We agree with you and our rules also satisfy that. Here the objects are not the digits, but the arithmetic problems themselves. The arithmetic rules can be applied to any arithmetic problems in the same base system, which satisfies the infinite requirement you pointed out.\n\nAdditionally, we provide the results on CLUTRR with first-order logic rules (e.g. If Y is X's aunt and Z is Y's father, Z is X's grandfather). Our HtT method can be applied to different forms of rules, such as first-order logic rules, propositional logic rules and arithmetic rules.\n\n| **CLUTRR** | **2 hops** | **3 hops** | **4 hops** | **5 hops** | **6 hops** | **7 hops** | **8 hops** | **9 hops** | **10 hops** | **Avg** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-shot CoT | 50.0 | 22.2 | 22.6 | 32.0 | 37.5 | 38.1 | 33.3 | 46.2 | 16.0 | 33.1 |\n| 5-shot CoT (propositional) | 50.0 | 55.6 | 71.0 | 80.0 | 50.0 | 52.4 | 30.0 | 46.2 | 20.0 | 50.6 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (propositional) | 100.0 | 61.1 | 74.2 | 84.0 | 75.0 | 38.1 | 56.7 | 53.8 | 36.0 | 64.3 (+13.7) |\n| 5-shot CoT (first order) | 50.0 | 71.4 | 90.9 | 90.6 | 76.5 | 88.6 | 75.9 | 66.7 | 66.7 | 75.2 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (first order) | 100.0 | 71.4 | 97.0 | 96.9 | 82.4 | 85.7 | 93.1 | 88.9 | 83.3 | **88.7 (+13.5)** |"

While arithmetic rules may not be so obvious, the relational rules such as \u201cfather\u2019s mother is grandmother\u201d learned for CLUTRR naturally satisfy your definition. For arithmetic rules, a formal way is to think \u201c3 + 4 = 7\u201d as \u201cin this base system, if the current input digits are 3 and 4, and there is no carry from the previous digit, the output digit should be 7\u201d. However, the formal version is unnecessarily redundant and costly for both human prompt writers and LLM inference."

What is the confidence of rules, how are they evaluated, and does LLM output a confidence score associated with the rules?\n2. This work is basically a technical report, some claims lack supportive facts or resources. For example, the authors say \"hallucination in LLMs resembles hypothesis generation in scientific discovery\", which is incorrect. In scientific discovery, hypotheses are generated by logical induction and abduction ([reference](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-discovery/)), while the logic behind hallucination remains unknown.\n3. Rules in the form of natural language weaken the generalisation ability and usually cause ambiguity and may confuse people. This is exactly the reason why Gottfried Leibniz calls for mathematical logic. However, most of the time, humans, like LLMs, are using natural language for reasoning, so I don't think the method proposed by this paper is bad. It would be interesting to make a more comprehensive test for the learned rules using formal methods, for example, ask LLMs to abstract those numerical rules in Appendix C into higher-order forms, such as Peano axioms and see if LLMs can make use of those more advanced rules."

                        "value": "Thanks for your recognition and constructive comments. Here is our response to your concerns.\n\n**W1: How does the induction stage work? How to use ground truth answers to verify the induced rules, does it require human annotators? What is the confidence of rules, how are they evaluated, and does LLM output a confidence score associated with the rules?**\n\nA1: The induction stage uses an LLM and CoT prompt to generate intermediate steps containing rules and the final answer, which are verified based on the ground truth answer. To compare the generated output and the ground truth answer, we take the last sentence of the generation and check if the ground truth answer is a full word in the output, following the open-source implementation of CoT[1]. As pointed out in Section 3.1, the confidence of a rule is defined by the probability that it leads to the correct answer on the training set. For example, if a rule occurs 5 times across the entire training set, and results in the correct answer for 3 times, its confidence is 0.6. The LLM doesn\u2019t need to output any confidence score for the rules. All the confidence scores are computed by the verification results on the final answer.\n\n**W2: This work is basically a technical report, some claims lack supportive facts or resources. For example, the authors say \"hallucination in LLMs resembles hypothesis generation in scientific discovery\", which is incorrect. In scientific discovery, hypotheses are generated by logical induction and abduction, while the logic behind hallucination remains unknown.**\n\nA2: We agree that scientific discovery may be generated by logical induction and/or abduction in many cases, and this is likely to be different from the mechanism of hallucination. Here we don\u2019t want to make any claim, but try to draw parallels between the hypotheses and hallucination \u2013 both may contain useful information but must be verified on a set of samples. This serves as a motivation for our method. If this doesn\u2019t address your concerns, we are happy to further discuss this and modify the introduction accordingly.\n\n**W3: It would be interesting to make a more comprehensive test for the learned rules using formal methods, for example, ask LLMs to abstract those numerical rules in Appendix C into higher-order forms, such as Peano axioms and see if LLMs can make use of those more advanced rules.**\n\nA3: That\u2019s a good question. We tried to prompt an LLM to automatically discover some more abstract rules or principles, but found the model can only do so when we provide the term \u201cPeano axioms\u201d in the instruction, which is too handcrafted for the arithmetic dataset and doesn\u2019t generalize to new tasks. Instead, we use a more generic instruction to ask the LLM to write some knowledge describing the rules. Due to the large variance in the generated description, we sample 5 descriptions for each base system, and report the mean and variance of the results. We found that the description generated by the LLM from the learned rule library can improve the reasoning performance compared to standard CoT, yet it is worse than HtT since the description often loses some detailed information of the rule library. One advantage of the generated description is that it compresses the rule library into some compact descriptions, which reduces the length of the prompt. We will include these results in the appendix of the paper.\n\n| **Arithmetic** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **Avg** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5-shot CoT | 83.3 | 71.1 | 61.5 | 52.8 | 47.4 | 46.2 | 75.0 | 36.8 | 42.3 | 57.4 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT | 100 | 94.7 | 84.6 | 88.9 | 71.1 | 46.2 | 86.1 | 68.4 | 65.4 | **78.4 (+21.0)** |\n| 5-shot CoT+higher-order forms | 81.6\u00b16.2 | 67.7\u00b18.6 | 60.6\u00b110.2 | 79.5\u00b18.1 | 61.5\u00b111.4 | 62.8\u00b16.7 | 81.6\u00b14.4 | 65.4\u00b18.1 | 55.0\u00b16.9 | 68.4\u00b12.4 (+11.0) |\n\n[1] Yao Fu.

                        "value": "Below is the instruction we used to ask the LLM to generate descriptions about the rule library.\n\n```\nInstruction: The following rules are learned from base-{{ base }} arithmetic problems. Use the rules to write some knowledge in a Wikipedia style. The knowledge will be used as a part of a prompt to teach a large language model to solve new problems. Try to make the knowledge precise and detailed so that even a weak large language model can understand the knowledge and reconstruct all the original rules from the knowledge.\n```\n\nHere is an example of the description generated by the LLM.\n\n```\nIn base-9 number system, addition operates on nine digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The operation can be broken down into following basic patterns:\n                                                                                                          \n- When any number is added to 0, the sum remains the same number (e.g., 3 + 0 = 3, 7 + 0= 7).\n- Summing two numbers less than 9 (without carry) remains a standard operation similar to base 10 addition (e.g., 3 + 4 = 7).\n- Exceptions are observed in specific cases where summing two numbers may yield a result in double digits. For instance, 1 + 8 yields the sum as 10 instead of 9. It changes the unit column to 0 and adds 1 to the tens column. This rule applies to all combinations that sum to 9 or more (e.g., 4 + 5 = 10, 6 + 3 = 10).\n- It's noteworthy that, in base-9 arithmetics, 10 is not a two-digit number but a single digit representing what would be 9 in decimal count.\n\nThe concept extends to the addition of multiple numbers. When sums exceeding 8 (the highest digit in base-9) result, $n overflow or carry occurs to the left, similar to traditional addition operation. For instance:\n- 1 + 3 + 1 results in 5, while 1 + 7 + 1 yields 10 (not 9 as in the decimal system).\n- Adding 7, 1, and 1 together will yield a sum of 10.\n- Adding 8, 1, and 1 together will yield 11 in base-9 arithmetic.\n\nOverall, base-9 arithmetic's behavior is similar to base 10, except that sums of 9 and above represent overflow conditions, leading to the next higher order of magnitude (e.g., tens column in simple addition), much like how 10 does in $ase-10. In other words, '10' is a single digit value in base-9 that translates to '9' in base-10.\n```"

In the deduction step, the induced rules are given as a knowledge base, and the model is expected to use rules to infer new answers. \n\nThe authors test there idea on simple synthetic datasets, by extending the Chain of Thoughts (CoT) and Least to Most (LtM) prompting methodology, showing consistent advantage of using the proposed method. The datasets consist of simple task of arithmetic in different bases and learning (simple) kinship relationship rules."

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive comments. Here is our response to your concerns.\n\n**W1 & Q2: The setting is too simple, the learnt rules are just true/false propositions of the form \"A is B\".**\n\nA1: The goal of using a simple setting is to reduce inference cost and allow manual analysis of error cases (e.g. Figure 3 in the paper). However, we should emphasize that HtT is not limited to learning proposition logic rules. Here we experiment HtT with first-order logic rules (e.g. If Y is X's aunt and Z is Y's father, Z is X's grandfather) on CLUTRR. It is observed that HtT with first-order logic rules perform even better than the propositional logic rules. We will update these results in the revision.\n\nWe note that HtT is not limited to certain forms of rules. However, besides rule learning, another problem that is important but is beyond the scope of this paper is the planning problem. In general, reasoning with first-order logic rules requires unification (i.e. to match rules and facts at each step), where for CLUTRR dataset the reasoning is a path-based special case. Empirically, we find it is hard to design a CoT prompt that teaches LLMs to perform unification for general case, as it requires planning abilities that LLMs typically don\u2019t possess[1]. As a result, we can\u2019t learn useful rules based on the CoT prompt when the task requires unification. A future work is to empower the rule learning with planning. If we have a deductive reasoning prompt that can perform unification, we believe HtT with that base prompt should be able to learn rules in general first-order logic settings.\n\n| **CLUTRR** | **2 hops** | **3 hops** | **4 hops** | **5 hops** | **6 hops** | **7 hops** | **8 hops** | **9 hops** | **10 hops** | **Avg** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-shot CoT | 50.0 | 22.2 | 22.6 | 32.0 | 37.5 | 38.1 | 33.3 | 46.2 | 16.0 | 33.1 |\n| 5-shot CoT (propositional) | 50.0 | 55.6 | 71.0 | 80.0 | 50.0 | 52.4 | 30.0 | 46.2 | 20.0 | 50.6 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (propositional) | 100.0 | 61.1 | 74.2 | 84.0 | 75.0 | 38.1 | 56.7 | 53.8 | 36.0 | 64.3 (+13.7) |\n| 5-shot CoT (first order) | 50.0 | 71.4 | 90.9 | 90.6 | 76.5 | 88.6 | 75.9 | 66.7 | 66.7 | 75.2 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (first order) | 100.0 | 71.4 | 97.0 | 96.9 | 82.4 | 85.7 | 93.1 | 88.9 | 83.3 | **88.7 (+13.5)** |\n\n**W2: The examples as shown in appendix are not very impressive, at least from a skim through, it seems the rules already exist explicitly in the prompt text. At this point how is this different from just knowledge retrieval as done in [1]. In fact the tasks presented in [1] seems much more nuanced than the one presented here.**\n\nA2: We guess you mistook the rules in HtT prompts as human-written or code-generated, while they are actually learned by LLMs in the induction stage. We\u2019ve clarified that rules in HtT prompts (Prompt 3, 5, 8 & 10) are just for demonstrating the format of the prompts in Appendix B. All the rule libraries used by HtT (Prompt 13-16) are learned in the induction stage. The only human-written rules are those in the few-shot exemplars, which are less than 10% of the size of the learned rule libraries for every dataset we used. Note the same set of human-written rules are used in the few-shot CoT prompt. So it is fair to use them to elicit and learn rules in HtT.\n\nIRCoT[2] augments CoT with an external corpus and a pretrained retriever, which is totally different from the setting of HtT. HtT learns a rule library from a training set and a standard CoT prompt, without any external corpus. Once the rule library is learned, the deduction stage of HtT is similar to the setting of IRCoT. We agree that IRCoT may be a better solution for our deduction stage, but we implement the rule library and retrieval steps as a prompt to make it a fair comparison with CoT.\n\n[1] Karthik Valmeekam, et al.

Furthermore, the authors have not tested CoT and LtM with XML tagging, making it unclear how much of their gains are from tagging, and how much is from the extracted knowledge.**\n\nA3: We agree that XML tagging brings a large gain in the performance, as shown by the ablation studies in Table 4. We are aware that XML tagging is used to separate different sections of the input, as documented by OpenAI and Anthropic. Here we extend this technique to guide the retrieval of knowledge in LLM generation. The XML tagging provides a prompting solution to improve the retrieval ability of LLMs without finetuning the model on retrieval tasks. As far as we know, there is no existing paper using XML tagging in such a way. With that being said, if you know any paper regarding this trick for retrieval, we are happy to cite and credit it.\n\nThis is a good suggestion on ablation studies. Here we apply the same XML tagging trick to CoT and LtM. Note that there isn\u2019t any rule library in CoT and LtM, so the tags only help elicit rules from the LLM, rather than retrieve rules from the library. We observe that XML tagging doesn\u2019t contribute significantly to the performance of our baseline methods except for CoT on Arithmetic. For both datasets and both prompting methods, HtT consistently outperforms baseline methods with XML tagging by a large margin, which suggests that our performance gain comes from the synergy of the learned rule library and XML tagging, rather than XML tagging alone. We will add these results in the revision.\n\n| **Prompt** | **Arithmetic** | **CLUTRR** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5-shot CoT | 57.4 | 50.6 |\n| 5-shot CoT (w/ XML tags) | 64.0 (+6.6) | 47.7 (-2.9) |\n| 5-shot CoT + HtT (w/ XML tags) | **78.4 (+21.0)** | **64.3 (+13.7)** |\n\n| **Prompt** | **Arithmetic** | **CLUTRR** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5-shot LtM | 51.0 | 46.8 |\n| 5-shot LtM (w/ XML tags) | 52.6 (+1.6) | 36.4 (-10.4) |\n| 5-shot LtM + HtT (w/ XML tags) | **62.0 (+11.0)** | **57.9 (+11.1)** |"

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive comments. Here is our response to your concerns.\n\n**W1: How are the rules extracted? Is it through regular expressions? How are the occurrence k and accuracy p calculated?**\n\nA1: As discussed in Appendix A, we extract the rules with regular expressions. Here are the regular expressions we used:\nNumerical reasoning: `[A-Z0-9]+(?: \\+ [A-Z0-9]+)+ = [A-Z0-9]+\\.`, which accepts a summation equation of arbitrary numbers or characters.\nRelational reasoning: `([a-zA-Z\\-]+)'s ([a-zA-Z\\-]+) is ([a-zA-Z\\-]+)\\.`, which accepts a sentence describing the combination of two arbitrary words. We note that HtT is not sensitive to the choice of regular expressions, as long as the regular expressions can extract rules from the human-written few-shot exemplars with 100% precision and recall. If the regular expression recalls wrong rules from the LLM, they can be easily filtered by our minimal occurrence criterion.\n\nThe occurrence of a rule is just the number of its occurrences in the induction stage. The accuracy of a rule is the probability of reaching the correct answer when the rule occurs. Taking the rules learned in base-9 as an example, a correct rule \u201c4 + 3 = 7\u201d occurs 20 times and leads to correct answers for 9 times in the induction stage, resulting in an accuracy of 0.45. The reason why correct rules don\u2019t have 100% accuracy is that they are sometimes combined with other wrong rules in some examples. A wrong rule \u201c7 + 5 = 12\u201d occurs 42 times and never leads to correct answers in the induction stage, resulting in an accuracy of 0. Therefore, a minimal accuracy p of 0.3 is enough to distinguish these rules. The minimal occurrence k is used to filter less reusable rules such as \u201c5 + 1 + 2 = 8\u201d, which is correct but only occurs when the previous step generates a carry of 2 by mistake. The choices of $k$ and $p$ for different datasets are provided in Appendix A.\n\n**W2: In the appendix, considering Prompt 2, it is evident that a substantial number of ground rules are already present within the prompt. If we rely solely on the rules from the prompt, what level of performance can be achieved?**\n\nA2: Prompt 2 is the CoT baseline, of which the results have already been provided in Table 1. The same prompt is also used in the induction stage of HtT to learn rules. We copy the results of GPT-4 here for visibility.\n\n| **Arithmetic** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **2 digits** | **3 digits** | **4 digits** | **Avg** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-shot CoT | 72.2 | 26.3 | 7.7 | 22.2 | 10.5 | 3.8 | 30.6 | 34.2 | 23.1 | 25.6 |\n| 5-shot CoT | 83.3 | 71.1 | 61.5 | 52.8 | 47.4 | 46.2 | 75.0 | 36.8 | 42.3 | 57.4 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT | 100 | 94.7 | 84.6 | 88.9 | 71.1 | 46.2 | 86.1 | 68.4 | 65.4 | **78.4 (+21.0)** |\n\nWe note that Prompt 2 provides only a very small fraction of the ground truth rules (10 rules compared to 512/242/162 ground truth rules in base-16/11/9 respectively). It is possible that these rules somehow help the LLM to recall rules, which explains why 5-shot CoT is better than 0-shot CoT. However, as shown in Table 1 & 2, with the learned rule library, HtT significantly improves over CoT.\n\n**W3: The citation is inconsistency.**\n\nA3: Thanks for pointing that out. We will update it in the revision.\n\n**W4: The paper falls short of providing a comprehensive description regarding the spectrum of problems that the introduced approach is adept at solving. The authors may provide a complete understanding of the method\u2019s capabilities and limitations.**\n\nA4: We plan to add a paragraph discussing the scope of HtT in the camera ready version. Based on what we observed for HtT in experiments, it has the following constraints.\n\n1) The task is approachable via CoT prompting, where each intermediate step explicitly uses a rule.\n2) While the rules can be in natural languages, they should have a consistent template, otherwise it is hard to count the occurrences of rules of the same semantics. \n3) The same set of rules are applicable for every sample in the whole dataset, otherwise we can\u2019t reuse rules learned from the training samples on the test samples. \n4) CoT has a reasonable performance on the task, otherwise we often get errors in the induction stage and can\u2019t learn the rules. \n5) The size of the rule library is moderately small, otherwise we can\u2019t fit it into the context length of the LLM in the induction stage.\n\nWe believe only constraint 3 is a hard limitation on the scope of problems solvable via HtT compared to CoT. Constraint 2 may be improved by using external models for matching rules of the same semantics. Constraint 4 is a general drawback on CoT. For example, CoT fails on tasks requiring unification of first-order logic rules, and we can\u2019t apply HtT in this case either. Constraint 5 may be solved by offloading the learned rule library to external databases using RAG or equivalent methods."

If unification is required during reasoning, can LLMs still utilize these rules for inference?**\n\nA5: Yes. Although we implement HtT to learn arithmetic rules and propositional logic rules in the paper, HtT is compatible with different forms of rules. Here we implement HtT to learn first-order logic rules (e.g. If Y is X's aunt and Z is Y's father, Z is X's grandfather) on CLUTRR. Surprisingly, we find that first-order logic rules perform significantly better than the propositional logic rules for both 5-shot CoT and 5-shot CoT+HtT. We will update these results in the revision.\n\nOne thing we need to point out is that, in general the first-order logic rules involves unification steps, which require planning and backtracking. For the CLUTRR the path of relations can be reduced from left to right in a deterministic way, but generally the unification is difficult and neither CoT or HtT can work in this case. However, we should emphasize that failure on unification is an issue of CoT, as HtT doesn\u2019t change the CoT prompt except prepending the learned rule library in the deduction stage. If we have a deductive reasoning prompt that can perform unification, we believe HtT with that base prompt should be able to learn rules in general first-order logic settings.\n\n| **CLUTRR** | **2 hops** | **3 hops** | **4 hops** | **5 hops** | **6 hops** | **7 hops** | **8 hops** | **9 hops** | **10 hops** | **Avg** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0-shot CoT | 50.0 | 22.2 | 22.6 | 32.0 | 37.5 | 38.1 | 33.3 | 46.2 | 16.0 | 33.1 |\n| 5-shot CoT (propositional) | 50.0 | 55.6 | 71.0 | 80.0 | 50.0 | 52.4 | 30.0 | 46.2 | 20.0 | 50.6 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (propositional) | 100.0 | 61.1 | 74.2 | 84.0 | 75.0 | 38.1 | 56.7 | 53.8 | 36.0 | 64.3 (+13.7) |\n| 5-shot CoT (first order) | 50.0 | 71.4 | 90.9 | 90.6 | 76.5 | 88.6 | 75.9 | 66.7 | 66.7 | 75.2 |\n| 5-shot CoT+HtT (first order) | 100.0 | 71.4 | 97.0 | 96.9 | 82.4 | 85.7 | 93.1 | 88.9 | 83.3 | **88.7 (+13.5)** |"
