                    "value": "The paper addresses the problem of limitations in traditional physical simulations, which rely on numerical schemes and mesh-refinement methods to balance precision and complexity. The proposed methodology is based on a double observation challenge, which involves extracting regularities from weakly informative physical variables that are sparsely measured in space and time. The authors propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain. System 1 is a discrete dynamical model used to compute a sequence of latent anchor states z_d auto-regressively, while System 2 is used to design a state estimator q retrieving the dense physical state at arbitrary locations (x, t). The proposed methodology has several potential implications and effectiveness. First, it allows for predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain, which is not possible with traditional methods. Second, it is trained on sparse observations, making it highly adaptable and efficient. Third, the proposed method is generalizable and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems."

The paper criticizes traditional physical simulations based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and numerical algorithms for their limitations in complex phenomena and handling sparse observations. It is imperative to acknowledge the extensive success and development of these traditional methods across various applications over the years. Data-driven methods, despite showing potential in overcoming some of these limitations, bring their own set of challenges and limitations. These include the substantial data requirements for training and the often opaque nature of these models, which can make interpretation and validation of results challenging.

However, we highlight that these papers address a very different task, and our contribution is not limited to the latent unroll method. In particular:\n- We support our design with theoretical results allowing us to analyze why our approach is beneficial,\n- We address the task of continuous production by introducing a new interpolation module based on attention,\n- We outperform the state-of-the-art, including on challenging datasets such as Eagle,\n- We provide numerous ablation studies and experiments to better support our method.\n\n> **The spacial resolution of the encoder's input in the most experiences (and the number of subsequent samples) is low. It is concerning if the proposed method is scalable to large resolution since f1 is implemented as MPNN that hardly captures global information unless the number of nodes is small. Do you observe any relationship among the number of processor blocks of f1, the spacial resolution, and the resulting error?**\n\nThis is an interesting and debatable remark. We would like to make the following observations:\n1) The low spatial resolution is motivated by our task, which seeks generalization over arbitrary positions, including unobserved ones. In the case of dense observation, there is probably no need for our method.\n2) GNNs are indeed known to struggle to capture long-range information. However, several empirical results (in particular, MeshGraphNet, Pfaff et al, 2021) show that they succeed in forecasting the dynamics of complex physics phenomena with dense observation grids.\n3) We conducted a study of the influence on the number of processor blocks of $f_1$ in Fig. 9a of the appendix and show that more blocks tend to improve the performances up to some extent.\n\nFinally, we argue that most of our contributions (ie. theoretical results, interpolation module based on attention, etc.) still hold with a different architecture of the processor unit, including more advanced GNN structures that may fit a particular problem.\n\n> **Why does the variance of the runtime of proposed method in Figure 7(b) sporadically get high?**\n\nFigure 7(b) shows the evolution of the runtime for a varying number of query positions (top graph) and query timesteps (bottom graph). The graphs show the runtime averaged on 100 consecutive runs of each model, and we represent the lower and upper bounds in the envelope (not the variance, this has been made explicit in the paper). We hypothesize that these spikes are due to outliers in the runs, potentially either due to the PyTorch or the python runtime engine. However, we observed that, in average, our method is sensibly faster than the baselines."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review.\n\n> **The model's reliance on a regular sampling rate could constrain its applicability.**\n\nWe indeed acknowledge this limitation in the conclusion of the main paper. Handling non-uniform sampling times is a more challenging task, and requires redesigning the auto-regressive forecaster. This modification is not trivial and requires additional work. In particular, our theoretical framework needs to be extended to a continuous setup for System 1. However, we believe that this is one of the next milestones for the future of our approach, and will explore the possibility of re-designing System 1 as a continuous-time system (implemented with Neural-ODE), thus allowing us to handle non-uniform time steps.\n\n> **A discussion on how the anchor state computation rate \u0394 influences performance would be beneficial.**\n\nThis study is available in Fig. 9b of the supplementary material. We observed that a higher value of $\\Delta$ degrades performances (since System 2 benefits from less anchor to interpolate the solution at an arbitrary location). However, choosing $\\Delta=\\Delta^*$ leads to poor generalization capacity in the time domain.\n\n> **what is the meaning of the small Figure on page 9 on the right? Is it a mistake?**\n\nThe small figure is a teaser of the experiments conducted in the supplementary material since many ablations are presented in the appendices.\n\n> **For System 2, the use of GRU implies iterative discrete predictions rather than time-continuous ones. Does this allow for predictions at arbitrary time frames?**\n\nThere is a misunderstanding. As stated in eq. (44) (45), the GRU is used to aggregate estimations of the solution (at arbitrary time and space locations) performed at different anchor points. As their name suggests, the \u201c*anchor points*\u201d provide estimates at fixed anchors which provide computational support, but they do not correspond to the time instant for which the prediction will be made. We designed the GRU to aggregate information over these anchors, but prediction and interpolation are performed by the GNNs and the attention module. Our model can perform predictions at arbitrary time frames, as shown in Table 2 (see *Ext-T* metrics)\n\n> **If the sampling rate \u0394 does not align with \u0394\u2217 such that \u0394 is not an integer multiple of \u0394\u2217, would this lead to enhanced model generalization for unseen time intervals?**\n\nThe value of the sampling rate $\\Delta$ is limited by the need for supervision of the auto-regressive backbone (we showed in Figure 7 of the appendix that removing this supervision is detrimental). If $\\Delta$ is not an integer multiple of $\\Delta^*$, we do not have access to supervision for the auto-regressive backbone.\n\n> **I am curious about the performance over long-time rollouts. Does executing rollouts in the hidden space contribute to more stable long-term predictions?**\n\nAs stated in the main paper, time extrapolation is outside the scope of this paper, but we agreed that this is an interesting property, and performed an extrapolation experiment reported in Table 3 of the appendix. We show that our model is capable of longer horizon prediction, and still outperforms the baselines.\n\n> **When the query position (x,t) has a time t that falls between two anchor states, how does the model do inference?**\n\nThe key to arbitrary time inference is the use of the attention mechanism to compute an estimation of the state $s(x,t)$ (with arbitrary position and time) conditioned by the anchor state, ie. $z_{n\\Delta}$ in eq. 42 of the main paper. These estimations are then merged using the GRU. It is important to note that, while the anchor points are discrete, the model can still interpolate to arbitrary positions thanks to the attention module."

If the training data is that sparse, how does a data-driven approach learn high-resolution details?**\n\nThe term \u201c*supervision*\u201d in the webpage indeed indicates the supervision used during training, ie. the sparse observation in the training dataset. Yet, while humans are not capable of reconstructing the high-resolution simulation, data-driven methods can exploit the physical prior knowledge extracted from the (large-scale) dataset during training to reconstruct missing parts using \u201cphysics-guided\u201d inference. To give a very high-level explanation,\n- the model learns regularities in two different ways: (1) For each instance (trajectory) it receives sparse observations over time, from which it can infer temporal regularities; (2) is also observes a large amount of trajectories from which it can infer regularities on full dataset/problem level by fusing all sparse observations and linking them to their initial conditions. This is a hard problem, but there is a large amount of information in the data. \n\n- as other inverse problems, the  interpolation of sparse observations is a problem which is traditionally less well solved by humans than computational models, be they based on precise modeling and inverting, or data-driven. The human visual system has not been \u201ctrained\u201d for this kind of problems, whereas computational models can pick up and exploit regularities efficiently, if they exist.\n\n> **as discussed in the paper, sparse observation yields an ill-posed state except the observed time period is long enough. How would the author resolve the ill-posedness? Are there any failure modes observed during the test time?**\n\nAs for many problems in machine learning, the Bayes error for this problem is not zero, i.e. there are instances for which it cannot be solved fully, but this does not mean that good quality predictions cannot be made by picking up regularities from data. As a similar case we can cite the SfM (structure from motion) problem in computer vision, which is known to be theoretically solvable only up to scale, but data-driven methods can produce unnormalized predictions by picking up regularities from data (eg. \u201ca car is not 3km long\u201d). \n\nIn our case, since the ground-truth PDE is unknown, addressing the ill-posedness nature of the problem fully theoretically is difficult. However, it can be mitigated using observability considerations. For instance, our method uses a sequence of discrete states to infer the state at arbitrary locations rather than a single time frame. Moreover, sampling points are distributed uniformly to prevent unobservable areas, which could lead to ill-posedness. In a nutshell, as many (most?) inverse problems solved with data-driven methods, we cannot address the issues fully theoretically, but argue that our model is tailored through inductive biases to mitigate it. \n\nWe would even go further and argue, that data-driven have a particular potential in the cases, where the illposed-ness nature of a problem is hard to model, and it is in these cases where they beat model-based methods. \nWe exposed and discussed failure modes on the EAGLE dataset in Appendix G of the paper.\n\n> **would it be possible to incorporate initial observation over a longer time step (instead of just s_d[0], but maybe s_d[0],s_d[1],...,s_d[n]) to make the problem less ill-posed. Given such a sparse initial state, there could be many plausible initial states, I am curious why would this work...**\n\nThis could be indeed possible and is supported by the concept of finite-time observability of dynamical systems (which is a milder assumption compared to strict observability) but requires access to a sequence of initial conditions. This is not the case in most simulation applications, which are initialized with a unique IC. \n\nFurthermore, using a sequence would require observing or simulating more time steps, before using our model to perform prediction hence lowering the need for a prediction."

On the other hand, the authors' approach hypothesizes the existence of a Markovian discrete system that is able to represent the advance in time. This is an equivalently strong hypothesis in my opinion. Furthermore, we assume that an latent space $\\mathbf{z}_d$ can be found using an encoder. This is even more relevant since they perform the time advancement in the latent space: with a scheme \"encode-process-decode\" at each timestep, the encoder needs to take care only of the spatial representation, instead in this case the temporal dynamics also need to be embedded."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review. \n\n> **I think that the authors could highlight better the hypothesis behind their model.**\n\nWe added clarification in the discussion in section 3.2. Apart from learnability, our approach leverages 3 hypotheses:\n1) **The existence of a discrete System 1** can be interpreted as a requirement on the sparse observations: we require the observed samples to follow a dynamics, ie. to contain enough information to be predictable, although it can be potentially complex. Markovianity is a mild assumption when applied to physical systems, but may not exist for some edge cases.\n2) **The observability of System 1** (ie. the existence of an encoder) this hypothesis (shared with DINo) allows us to retrieve a complete representation of the state of the system from an observation. This is mandatory since we perform prediction from a single-frame sparse initial condition rather than a sequence. \n3) **Finite-time observability of System 2** is discussed thoroughly in the paper and is arguably a milder assumption compared to the strict observability condition required in MaGNeT\n\nWith respect to Dino, one difference which we think might by important is the fact that our dynamics is supposed to be in an embedding space and not in the space of network parameters (Dino predicts modulations for implicit representations).\n\n> **the encoder needs to take care only of the spatial representation, instead in this case the temporal dynamics also need to be embedded.**\n\nThe temporal dynamics is indeed embedded in the latent space $z_d$, but this does not affect the encoder, which is only used once on the initial condition. Temporality will be handled by the (much more expressive) GNNs layers. Moreover, we argue that, since the state representation remains in the latent space, our model can store and use temporal knowledge in the vector. On the other end, encode-process-decode schemes discard this information to fall back to the physical space. \n\n> **In the introduction, the model from Yin et al. (2022) does satisfy R3, so it would be better to correct the statement there**\n\nWe apologize for this confusion and fixed the introduction in the main paper. Fortunately, this error did not propagate, and DINo is correctly presented in the rest of the paper.\n\n> **The loss function (eq. 13) has two terms, did you check how the balance of the two terms affects the solution?**\n\nWe conducted an ablation study by zeroing the term related to System 1 in the loss and showed that this impacts performances negatively. In practice, we observed that equal weighting of each term already results in significantly outperforming the baselines. We show the impact of the weighting in the cost function in new figure 9b in the appendix.\n\n> **The author state that there is a trade-off in the performance of psi_q. Did you train different models to quantify it?**\n\nWe did investigate the relationship between the accuracy of the model and the length of the anchor sequence by testing different values of $\\Delta$ (see Fig. 9a). We indeed observe that reducing the number of anchor states (ie. increasing $\\Delta$) has a negative impact on performance, as suggested by Proposition 2. Yet, we also observed that exploiting every observed time frame (ie. $\\Delta$=$\\Delta^*$) is detrimental to the interpolation capacity of the model.\n\n> **It would be better to focus on more challenging benchmarks**\n\nWhile we agree that one of the next milestones of our approach is to address more and more challenging tasks, we would like to point out that the tasks used in our experiments are standard and widely used in very recent literature (in particular Yin et al. 2022). In addition to the benchmarks covered in this paper, we also conducted experiments on the challenging EAGLE dataset, which represents a leap in difficulty with regards to the literature."
