The evaluation is insufficient and confusing. The results in Table 1 shows there is no significant improvement between the proposed approach and the baselines. The proposed approach is trying to achieve good alignment for both text prompt and the style. However, the paper evaluates the text alignment, style alignment, and image quality separately. It is hard to see how much improvement the proposed approach achieved compared to the other approaches.\n3. More ablation studies are needed to justify the contribution. For example, how much does image shuffling improve the performance? How does the combined attention impact the attention weight in Figure 3(e). How would the design of the transformer model in Figure 2 impact the performance?\n4. Would mixing various styles impact the performance. How to keep the extracted style consistent between multiple images?\n5.  The paper writing style can be improved. For example, the vanilla style adapter is not well defined in section 3.2. Figure 2 is not aligned with the text description. There are also a lot of typos in the paper, e.g. TOW, etc."

Furthermore, a semantic suppressing vision model is used to suppress the semantic content of style images.Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms some training-free works."

First is the semantic-suppressing visual model (SSVM), which translates a set of style reference images into style embedding. To suppress the semantics while extracting style, the paper proposes to shuffle patches. Second is two-path cross-attention. In addition to existing (thus frozen) pre-trained text cross-attention module, the paper proposes to train a cross-attention with respect to the style embedding and sum outputs of two cross-attention modules. SSVM and Stable diffusion are frozen, and style cross-attention module and style embedding module are trained on a 600K image-text paired data (LAION aesthetics). Experimental results show that the model can generate images consistent in styles to style reference images."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- Overall technical contribution is rather marginal.\n\n- While the proposed method seems to outperform other diffusion-based style consistent image generation, it is unclear how it compares against results based on the StyleDrop. Results in Figure 12 suggests that, while generated images are consistent styles to each other, it is not as consistent to the style reference images to StyleDrop. \n\n- First two rows of Figure 12 suggest that the style is not really well transferred to different text prompt. For example, baby penguin, monkey are not really \"rusty\" for the second row, and monkey or bench are not covered with grass in the first row.\n\n- Some styles considered in the paper may be too generic and may be generated via text prompt engineering. For example, Figure 11 third row. Also, the generation results only captures the texture, but not the color scheme or the layout. It would be great if authors can provide more results on the diverse set of style reference images (e.g., those considered in StyleDrop) and discuss the limitation more comprehensively.\n\n- It would be great to include the interface used for user study and more details about how the question was asked, which options raters are provided to answer, etc.\n\n- This begs a question on the definition of \"style\" the paper has considered. Are color or texture schemes style? How about the layout or composition? It seems the shuffling technique of SSVM seems to make style to be limited to more local properties (e.g., color, texture) but not really the global properties. It would be great if authors can provide textual description of the style that the model is trying to extract. Also, it would be great to have an ablation study with different shuffling strategy (e.g., block shuffling to retain more global properties)."
