There are not much analyses why there are distractors and how sensitive is the proposed method against the segmentation accuracy. It basically assume the SAM segmentation is good enough such that the segments belong to the same object can be grouped successfully using the proposed method in Sec. 3. Although it demonstrate some good results, the scene are relatively simple which has only one dominant object. I am not fully convinced that the method proposed in Sec. 3 is general enough for handling complex scene with many objects. I am also not convinced that the proposed method can handle tiny objects effectively since the tiny objects are likely to be filtered out by the proposed method as distractors. \n\nConsidering the limited technical novelty and the potential problems on complex scene and tiny objects, I am not convinced that the submission has reach the bar of acceptance."

Then, it segments out regions that include pixels considered as distortion using the SAM model. Finally, it removes the segmented-out pixels from the training images to reduce the inference of distortion. The paper then conducts experiments on the RobustNeRF dataset and a synthetic dataset."

In real-world scenarios, noise and distortion can originate from various sources, such as inaccurate camera calibration, motion blur, out-of-focus blur, JPEG compression noise, and more. Simply discarding the information from these inconsistent pixels by segmenting out the entire region may result in significant information loss, especially in cases like inaccurate camera calibration and motion blur. I would recommend that the author reconsider this approach and seek to improve it.\n2. The presentation of the results is limited. It is challenging to assess the effectiveness of the approach based on the content in the current version of the paper. I suggest that the author include more qualitative results, as there is more than half a page remaining empty.\n3. The Method section is not well-written, containing numerous typos and mistakes. For example, the line following equation 5 states \"loss is defined as,\" but it proceeds to show how theta is computed. Additionally, the notion of I(r, r) appears to be unscientific."

What if this approach is applied to JPEG compression noise?"
