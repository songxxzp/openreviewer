                    "value": "This paper proposes CycleAlign, an iteratively AI preference alignment framework. The core idea is collaborative interaction between the black-box LLM and white-box model. For each instruction, the white-box model generates multiple responses to an input prompt with varying degrees of human alignment. Then both white-box and black-box models rank the response at the same time, with the black-box one adopting some in-conext demonstration while white-box one doesn't. Then the white-box model is optimized based on the black-box ranking, while the demonstration of black-box model is updated with the ranking that both models agree. The cyclical interaction loops up to N times (N=5 in this paper). Experiments show the effectiveness of the dynamic alignment algorithm."

                    "value": "1. The dynamic alignment resembles the actor-critique framework of PPO to some extent. Therefore, compared to offline methods like DPO, RRHF, and PRO, the iterative update for the black-box model may keep it caught up with the knowledge/distribution of the white-box model and thus provide a more accurate ranking. This online idea is very interesting and the effectiveness of updating demonstration has been demonstrated in experiments.\n2. This approach appears to be data efficient and works well with only 1000 instructions."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The biggest concern for the method is that, though the method is data-efficient, on the other hand, it can be expensive to scale up the instructions since each instruction requires querying commercial models 5 times. On the contrary, the baseline methods can easily scale up the training data and may benefit from larger data sizes.\n2. The evaluation is skeptical. The author uses a reward model to score the responses of different models. However, the reliability and capacity of the reward model remain unknown, hence I am not sure if the evaluation is reliable. Moreover, only HH-RLHF is adopted for evaluation, which is not enough to demonstrate the general effectiveness.\n3. The writing should be improved. For example, the author spent half of the abstraction to elicit the claim \"researchers have begun to align the language model with human preference from AI feedback\". On the contrary, their motivation is not well-explained. Also, as a very important metric in experiments, the details of the reward model they used is missing.\n4. The method is not so effective regarding human evaluation. This method is comparable with the original PRO on helpfulness online/rejection split. This further confirms my concern about weakness #2."

                    "value": "Though this paper is relatively well-written and organized, there are three main problems:\n\n* The motivation of the core components is questionable, and some key information is missing. Since RLAIF is not a new idea, the main contributions of this work lie in (a) the combination of both student and teacher models\u2019 rankings and (b) dynamical demonstrations. \n    1. The authors claimed several times that their method could \u2018*break the bottleneck of black-box models*\u2019 (Sec. 1, Sec. 4.3, Sec. 7), but it\u2019s unclear what the bottleneck is and why the proposed method would work for it.\n\n    2.  (a) is unreasonable and unnatural for me. Since the black-box model is always weaker than the black-box one (ChatGPT in this work) (as shown in Table 1), the white-box LLM\u2019s ranking would bring more noise. It\u2019s hard to understand why it could improve the alignment process.\n\n* The experimental settings are problematical, making results unconvincing.\n   \n    1. The proposed method, as a kind of RLAIF, should be compared with previous RLAIF methods (Bai et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023), instead of the original ranking-based alignment tuning methods. Since RLAIF can be considered a kind of data augmentation method, it would definitely improve the original methods.\n    \n    2. Some key ablation experiments are missing. To justify the effectiveness of the two designs (a) and (b), besides the ablation on dynamic demonstration, the authors should also compare more settings: i) with only the black-box rankings and ii) with only white-box rankings.\n\n* Some essential designs need more in-depth analysis. \n   1. The performance drop of CycleAlign_{PRO} + Alpaca and LLaMa on Harmless_{base} in Table 1.\n   2. In Table 4, CycleAlign+PRO w/o dynamic demonstration achieves a total reward of 67.36, even worse than the original PRO (67.64) in Table 1.
