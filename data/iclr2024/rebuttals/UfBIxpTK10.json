                        "value": "Thank you very much for your feedback and questions, we truly appreciate the effort and time you spent on the review. We responded to each of your comments and questions below and we adapted the manuscript to reflect these changes.\n\n**Q: The paper mentioned a lot of works in terms of neural network architecture and data augmentation. However, I could not see their connections to the main topic of generalization. In Table 1, all those attempts failed to improve DIFFDOCK performance in the DockGen benchmark in terms of success rate(<2A).**\n\nThe reason why we tested these different approaches is that a few of the most widely used techniques to improve generalization used with neural networks are (1) improve inductive biases in neural architecture, (2) get more data, (3) perform data augmentation. Indeed, these strategies do not seem to provide significant improvements in this setting (with arguably the exception of data increase). We do report these \"failed attempts\" because we believe it gives the reader a better understanding of the tradeoff between different approaches. We clarified this point in the manuscript.\n\n**Q: Although a code repo is provided, I can not find any details about how baselines are benchmarked with the DockGen dataset. Specifically, when new data-split is provided, it is important to report whether baselines are re-trained or not. I am also confused by unclearified marks like EX. 64\u2026 In Table 1, do you retrain GNINA or other machine learning methods under the DockGen split?**\n\nThank you for raising these points. We tried to clarify them below and in the manuscript. The DockGen benchmark was designed specifically to be compatible with the dataset and splits the baselines were originally trained on i.e. the (validation and) test sets contain complexes that belong to different clusters from those seen in PDBBind's training and validation set. Therefore none of the baselines required retraining. Ex. indicates the level of search exhaustiveness that can be regulated in search-based methods.\n\n**Q: The effect of confidence bootstrapping is not approperately evaluated. Although the performance is demonstrated on 8 clusters, it is documented that there are 63 clusters in the test set. It is not convincing to claim the proposed method is effective before a more systematic and quantitative evaluation.**\n\nAs a reminder, the model is finetuned on individual protein clusters. We have selected the 8 clusters in the test set by including all clusters that have 6 or more complexes. Most clusters contain 2 or less complexes, and it is difficult to fine-tune on clusters with very little structural or binding data (on top of being computationally very expensive to finetune 63 different models). Although we only include 8 clusters out of 63 in the test set, the 8 clusters actually contain 85 out of 189 complexes in the test split. We clarified these points in the manuscript.\n\n**Q: Why is ECOD used for data split? Best to my knowledge, SCOP(e) and CATH are more widely acknowledged.**\n\nWe largely expect ECOD, SCOP(E), and CATH to give similar splits (see the introduction of [1]). We used ECOD also because it is automated and applied to every PDB entry.\n\n[1] R. D. Schaeffer, J. Zhang, L. N. Kinch, J. Pei, Q. Cong, N. V. Grishin, Classification of domains in predicted structures of the human proteome. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 120, e2214069120 (2023)\n\n**Q: 1QXZ and 5M4Q have a sequence similarity of 22% but not 16%. I blast it myself.**\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We obtained the 16% value with the pw2.align.globalxx routine of biopython. However, we recognize that BLAST is a more widely accepted score and have updated the manuscript accordingly. \n\n**Q: Why do traditional methods like SMINA not perform well on the DockGen benchmark?**\n\nWe believe it is for a combination of reasons: (1) they also contain some parameters that have been fitted to protein domain clusters that are unlikely to be contained in our benchmark (i.e. the receptors are harder than for example those in PDBBind), (2) the receptors present in our test set are on average larger than those present in PDBBind's test set making the docking prediction potentially harder. We now plot these statistics and discuss this point in Appendix A.2."

                        "value": "**Q: Only 4 out of 8 clusters are proved to be improved by confidence bootstraping. Why are other clusters not improved?**\n\nIndeed of out the 8 clusters we see 4 with significant improvements, 2 with marginal improvements and 2 with no improvements. The level of success of confidence bootstrapping seems to be largely dependent on the initial quality of the score model in the given cluster: if no good poses are ever sampled by the model the bootstrapping process has no way of succeeding. In other words, for the bootstrapping process to succeed the initial generative model needs to have some (non-negligible) coverage of the correct poses in its distribution. One possible strategy to alleviate this would be to use a combination of confidence models trained to recognize poses at larger cutoffs (current one was trained with 2A), as discussed in the paper, the larger the cutoff the less likely will be the confidence model to generalize. We demonstrate this point in Figure C.1 where, with an oracle confidence model that gives signal in the right direction even beyond 2A, the model is able to improve significantly across all clusters.\n\n**Q: In the paper Do Deep Learning Models Really Outperform Traditional Approaches in Molecular Docking? (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.07134.pdf), a new baseline of DIFFDOCK+Vina(UniDock) is proposed. It would be more approperate to be compared with than P2RANK+SMINA.**\n\nThank you for the suggestion, we have added the baseline DiffDock+GNINA (an improved version of Vina) to Table 1.\n\n___\n\nThank you again for the very constructive feedback! We are happy to integrate any further suggestion you may have and we hope the improvements have helped increase your conviction on the value of our work."

The key points are:\n\n- Existing docking benchmarks are limited in diversity, focusing on common binding modes. A new benchmark DOCKGEN is proposed based on binding protein domains to better test generalization.\n- ML docking models show very weak generalization on DOCKGEN. Increasing training data and data augmentation do not help much.\nA new training approach \"Confidence Bootstrapping\" is proposed. It trains a diffusion docking model using high-confidence poses judged by a separate confidence model, without ground truth data.\n- Confidence Bootstrapping significantly improves model accuracy on DOCKGEN, doubling search-based methods. It is more sample-efficient than self-training."

We integrated all your suggestions in the updated version of the manuscript and summarized the additions below.\n\n**Q: Confidence boostrapping is much like a RL-based method, therefore the authors need to add more discussions about RL and its related works in docking and science.**\n\nThank you for raising this point. We have updated the manuscript to include a discussion on the connection between RL and our method. This is presented in detail in Appendix D, where we present the mathematical and practical similarities and differences of our approach with policy gradients. In brief, the direct application of the approach of policy gradient to diffusion models fails due to the intractability of the likelihood function, however, we show that by modifying the RL objective, Confidence Bootstrapping can be seen as maximizing a lower bound to the expected objective (we leave the specific details to Appendix D). Further, we discuss the relation of our work with previous application of RL for protein-protein or protein-ligand docking.\n\n**Q: There is one recent work that achieves strong performance on unseen targets (though split by UniProt ID), the authors are strongly encouraged to compared the performance on that model: FABind, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06763**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We tried running FABind on the DockGen benchmark but have so far been unsuccessful. The repository does not give precise instructions on how to preprocess the data (in README the inference on custom complexes section is referred as \"coming soon\"). It does mention that the preprocessing is the same as TANKBind, but when we tried using the preprocessed data we generated for TANKBind we ran into some errors. We will reach out to the authors to understand how to run the model and will update the results in the future.\n\n**Q: More analysis needed on what protein features DOCKGEN probes that past benchmarks missed.**\n\nAlthough it is hard to point out specific protein features that are captured in DockGen but not in PDBBind's test set, the main property that DockGen is able to probe is the capacity of generalization to new binding modes. To highlight this we conduct a careful analysis of the binding sites in the various datasets in Appendix A.2 comparing the similarities that the different benchmarks have with the training set. \n\nIn particular, we extract the binding sites of different complexes and then compare them both at a sequence/chemical (using the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix to quantify the similarity of aligned residues) and structural (using the TMalign output for any aligned residues) level. The results, shown in Figure 5, show significant overlap in the pockets in PDBBind and very little similarity when looking at DockGen pockets. More details on this analysis can be found in Appendix A.2.\n\n**Q: Ablation studies could better isolate benefits of different components of Confidence Bootstrapping.**\n\nThank you for raising this suggestion. We have now included a number of the ablation results of different components of the method (use of buffer, buffer size, use of training examples, sampling schedule\u2026) in Appendix E."

                        "value": "**Q: Computational cost and sample efficiency could be compared to alternate training schemes.**\n\nThank you for raising this point. We have now added a discussion on the computational cost in Appendix C.3 and refer to it in the main text as well. The runtime of our approach depends on the number of complexes sampled and the number of gradient update steps. In our experiment, on average we sample 320 complexes in the cluster for every 200 gradient update steps (with a batch size of 5). We interleave these two operations 60 times. With these parameters and training on one Nvidia A6000 GPU, the average run time is 8 hours. \n\nUnfortunately, it is hard to evaluate the sample efficiency of our approach with radically different training schemes, as no such method for finetuning has been proposed before. However, in the ablation experiments of Appendix E one can look at the rate with which the performance of the finetuned models improves to determine the relative sample efficiency of different variations of the method.\n\nOne can also try to compare this cost with for example running GNINA, which generalizes better without retraining but it is considerably slower and cannot be finetuned on specific domains. Assuming the methods (GNINA & DiffDock w/ confidence bootstrapping) work similarly, then one can ask in which setting would it be faster to run either one of them. It takes 232 inference complexes for DiffDock to amortize the cost of the finetuning and from then onwards it can provide significant runtime improvements. As many screening campaigns require significantly more than 232 complexes, we believe that the idea of finetuning a docking model to the specific target class of interest may prove a useful feature in the future.\n\n___\n\nThank you again for the very constructive feedback! We are happy to integrate any further suggestion you may have and we hope the improvements have helped increase your conviction on the value of our work."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your constructive feedback and positive review. Below we respond to each of your questions and we have updated the manuscript to reflect these changes. We are glad you appreciated the paper and we hope that our responses clarify your questions.\n\n**Q: The authors have made a number of somewhat significant changes to it, even before testing the Confidence Bootstrapping (i.e. the results in Table 1). I think it makes things a bit confusing for readers that are already very familiar with the field and the method (which I was not).** \n\nMost of the changes we made were targeted at making running the score and confidence models faster to make our method faster. We tried to clarify these points in the paper and, as you suggested, to make contributions more clear we have added some rows in Table 1. \n\n**Q: Although the writing and presentation is overall very good, I find a few small parts to lack clarity.** \n\nThank you for raising these points, we responded to each point below with an explanation, and we tried to clarify these points in the manuscript as well. Please let us know if you still find some of the explanations unclear.\n\n**1. For instance in Section 4.2 (paragraph 4), it is not really clear to me why the more local and easier task of testing the goodness of a pose can make it easier to generalize to unseen targets.** \n\nThe harder an underlying task is, the more a model is likely to overfit by capturing some spurious correlations in the data instead of the underlying signal. Classifying poses is generally considered to be an easier task than generating new poses. This is why we hypothesized that the confidence model would generalize better to unseen targets compared to the score model. \n\n**2. The relationship to the multi-resolution structure of diffusion models is also not very clear to me.** \n\nAt some noise level, the score model has to reason about what types of conformations are more likely to be correct, i.e. it should reason about what part of the space contains the optimal conformation(s). The larger the noise, the more the space over which the score model has to reason is large (since the noise level provides it a prior over the state space), and, therefore, the score model will rely on heuristics that are more likely to overfit. \n\n**3. The explanation and justification on the choice to limit the order of the spherical harmonics is a bit cryptic, especially compared to the level of details of the rest.**\n\nIn all honesty, we believe this is a relatively unimportant empirical finding, that is purely aimed at reducing the runtime of the score and confidence models and not significantly affecting the way they work. We have clarified and put less emphasis on it in the updated manuscript to avoid potential confusion.\n\n**Q: To get a clearer overall picture of the performance of the proposed approach(es), I think it would make sense to add the Confidence Bootstrapping results in Table 1 (even if results would only be reported in the DockGen-clusters column).** \n\nThank you for the suggestion, we added this row.\n\n**Q: In addition to be able to see more clearly the improvement in terms of performance, it would also be useful to see the runtime of this approach. I have no insight on how costly the confidence bootstrapping is, from a runtime perspective.**\n\nThank you for raising this point. We added this discussion in Appendix C.3 and referred to it in the main text as well. The runtime of our approach depends on the number of complexes sampled and the number of gradient update steps. In our experiment, on average we sample 320 complexes in the cluster for every 200 gradient update steps (with a batch size of 5). We interleave these two operations 60 times. With these parameters and training on one Nvidia A6000 GPU, the average run time is 8 hours. \n\nOne can try to compare this cost with for example running GNINA (here we assume the default version without extra search exhaustiveness), which generalizes better without retraining but it is considerably slower and cannot be finetuned on specific domains. Assuming the methods (GNINA & DiffDock w/ confidence bootstrapping) perform similarly, then one can ask in which setting would it be faster to run either one of them. It takes 232 inference complexes for DiffDock to amortize the cost of the finetuning and from then onwards it can provide significant runtime improvements. As many screening campaigns require significantly more than 232 complexes, we believe that the idea of finetuning a docking model to the specific target class of interest may prove a useful feature of these models in the future."

                        "value": "**Q: The choice, during the update step, of using a ratio of half-half training samples coming from real, and from the buffer seems a bit arbitrary to me, especially combined with the choice of using only training samples for small t. Wouldn't it make sense to use a ratio that varies more smoothly, i.e. an increasing proportion of buffer samples as t increases?**\n\nThank you for raising these points. Regarding the use of training samples, while the RL objective is to directly maximize reward/confidence, we also want to prevent the model from overfitting into pathological spaces of the confidence model (where the confidence model gives high confidence for bad poses) aka \"overoptimization\", which is why we included the real samples from training set. We added a discussion on this point in Appendix D and we hope this clarifies the intuition of combining the two losses. We also added an ablation experiment that uses no real samples during fine-tuning (see Appendix E). \n\nRegarding the sampling ratio/weight of the training loss for different t. Note that because of the way we sample t (which is directly related to the loss weight $\\lambda(t)$), even when considering $t_{min}=0.3$ the proportion of buffer samples is 0 until 0.3 and then increases gradually. We have clarified this point in the manuscript by instead of framing it in terms of sampling distribution we look at the difference in loss weight $\\lambda$ vs $\\lambda'$.\n\n**Q: Also, the results in Table 1 look at the percentage of top-ranked predictions with RMSD smaller than 2 and 5A. 2A certainly is a commonly used and satisfactory threshold. On the other hand, 5 is admittedly a very high threshold (cf the remark at the end of Section 4 stating that a RMSD larger than 4A constitutes a negative example). Do you have any comment about this?**\n\nIndeed 5A is large and a pose 5A away typically cannot be considered a \"good pose\", however, we report it (while definitely not focusing on this throughout the paper) because (1) it has been used a lot in the literature, (2) it can represent approximately whether or not the model guesses the correct pocket which might be a useful question when dealing with blind docking.\n\n___\n\nThank you again for your time and effort spent in reviewing and providing careful feedback, we hope to have clarified your questions!"

Molecular docking methods based on machine learning do not perform well when confronted with unknown binding pockets, and this issue is not adequately addressed in previous benchmarks. In this benchmark, the validation and testing datasets are extracted from a different database, Binding MOAD, which contains new classes of binding pockets (based on clustering). The testing binding pockets are ensured to have a different shape than those in the training dataset. The ML-based docking methods fail in this benchmark, so a new training strategy is proposed to improve the results of the diffusion-based models. This strategy is called Confidence Bootstrapping and can be used to train (or fine-tune) DiffDock. The paper demonstrates that this methodology is effective in improving the results of DiffDock in the proposed benchmark, which focuses on model generalization."

Given the recent criticism of ML-based docking models, it would be advised to include conformation quality metrics like those proposed in PoseBusters [1].**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer and the authors of [1] that the quality of poses is an important metric. However, [1] shows that although the poses coming out of the diffusion model do not pass all quality metrics most of the time, they do pass them while remaining accurate typically if a quick energy minimization is applied. In [1] (Figure 5) the performance of DiffDock <2A goes down (in their benchmark) only from 38% to 35% if quality checks are also applied, assuming poses are relaxed (instead of 12% without relaxation). Therefore we believe that it makes sense to apply these checks in combination with the relaxation. To perform this test, we reached out (twice) to the authors of [1] to get the code used for the relaxation procedure, however, they said they will only release it in the future. Once this code is made available we'd be very interested in adding these metrics as the reviewer suggested!\n\n**Q: It would be interesting to quantify the similarity between the binding pockets used in training, fine-tuning, and testing.

Indeed for fine-tuning and testing, we use data from the BindingMOAD dataset as we are finetuning on protein clusters that were not present in PDBBind. The critical difference is that the fine-tuning process only uses the protein structures and the ligand identities and not the docked structures that are then what is evaluated at testing time. Further, there was also no leakage w.r.t. the hyperparameters as these were obtained when running fine-tuning on the validation set (that contains different clusters). This setup simulates a relatively common setting in screening campaigns where researchers typically have access to some accurate protein structures and the identity of some ligands binding to it derived from some experimental assays. At that point, before running a large-scale screening campaign the researchers could use confidence bootstrapping to finetune their docking model.\n\nThank you for the suggestion on quantifying the similarity between binding pockets in the training data vs testing. We conducted a careful analysis of the similarity of the binding sites in DockGen test set and the training set and comparing this with the similarities observed in the commonly used PDBBind splits. We extract the binding sites of different complexes and then compare them with one another both at a sequence/chemical (using the BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix to quantify similarity of aligned residues) and structural (using the TMalign output for any aligned residues) level. The results, shown in Figure 5, show significant overlap in the pockets in PDBBind and very little similarity when looking at DockGen pockets. More details on this analysis can be found in Appendix A.2."

                        "value": "**Q: Why have you decided to call your method Confidence Bootstrapping? This setup does not remind me of the classical bootstrapping method.**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the method is not related to the method of bootstrapping used in mathematics. However, the term bootstrapping has a wider meaning in English where it indicates \"to create something using the minimum amount of resources possible\" (Oxford dictionary). In this sense our motivation for choosing the name is the ability of the model to learn to sample good poses for unseen protein classes without access to data only relying on the feedback from the confidence model and the binary information that a protein and ligand bind (the minimum amount of resources possible).\n\n**Q: What do you think about including conformation quality metrics in the benchmark, like those proposed in PoseBusters? Do you think that self-training using the confidence model can impact the pose quality in any significant way?**\n\nSee the answer above. Moreover, including relaxation and quality checks could improve the confidence score and therefore lead to the sampling of complexes that are more likely to be correct and can be relaxed to good poses (in terms of quality metrics).\n\n___\n\nThank you again for the thoughtful feedback and questions! We hope the improvements and clarifications might warrant raising your score and we are happy to continue the conversation."
