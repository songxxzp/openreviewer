The final weighting parameter (as we learn this, it is rather a parameter than a hyper-parameter) is obtained by averaging out the third layer output and passing it to a sigmoid function. We will add this detail in the revision.\n\n$\\to$ Training hyper-parameters: we found that using the same learning for the 3 components in Alg 1. yields robust results as opposed to tuning the hyperparameters. This is due to the MLP being relatively simple in architecture which makes it easier to train robustly. Then, the MLP re-weights the loss values adaptively, which makes training the other component more stable.\n\n$\\to$ Effect on performance: We experimented with variations of the architecture and hyperparameters of the MLP but it had little impact on the final performance.\n\n> Minor: Fig. 8 and 9 are not quite clear as they are not high-resolution.\n\n$\\to$ Thank you for the suggestion!

To further enhance generalization, the authors incorporate adversarial balancing and employ multi-resolution input techniques.

In other words, parameter updates near the threshold are exacerbated which means a few samples can incur large changes in the binary weights. Unfortunately, the changes in the binary weights is what actually trains the binary network even if they are exacerbated. Thus, gradient updates from samples in the long-tail classes could be amplified, which would worsen the overfitting to the small number of training samples in the LT class. In other words, the binary networks are more prone to data scarcity in the LT data. \nAs an illustrative empirical demonstration, we present Fig. 4-(a) that shows that the classifier weight norms for tail classes rose more for binary networks than for FP networks. Higher classifier weight norms for tail classes indicates the network learned to multiply high weights to features present in the infrequent training samples in the long-tail classes.\n\n\n> Flow improvement: There are some instances where the writing or logical flow could be improved. I've noted some specific cases below:\n\n$\\to$ Thank you for the valuable suggestions to improve 2.1 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4. We will change them accordingly in the revision. \n\nFor your question about Sec. 2.5: Multi-resolution training can be understood as data augmentation where we explicitly obtain more training data by using differently resized images. This is particularly beneficial for our problem of binary LT as binary LT is more prone to the data-scarcity in long-tailed classes (please refer to our answer regarding the question on special difficulties of binary LT ).\n\n> Regarding section 3.3, it appears that multi-resolution learning is primarily for efficient training. Would it be more fitting to discuss this within the implementation of experiments? Alternatively, is it integral to the overall framework's effectiveness?\n\n$\\to$ We agree that the implementation of the multi-resolution could be discussed within the experiment section. Rather, we should provide the motivation for the multi-scale training in the approach instead, as described in our second answer to the question regarding flow improvement in Sec. 2.5. While it is not integral to our approach, it certainly does help when we can utilize it (please see Tab 3 for ablation results)."

The motivation of the paper is to train the resource constrained binary network on a real-world long-taile dataset. For this the authors propose the Calibrate and Distill Framework, which uses a combination of feature similarity loss and logit distillation loss, to jointly optimize the neural network on the long tailed data. The three major components of the proposed approach are calibrate and distill, Adversarial lambda learning and Multi-Resolution training. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated across 15 datasets including both the small scale and large scale dataset."

Hence, it\u2019s unclear whether the LT classes in target dataset really constitute the long tail distribution or not.\n\n$\\to$ We cordially argue that whether the LT classes in the target dataset constitute the long tail distribution in the pretraining data is not a critical matter to our proposed approach. Specifically, we design our method to not be dependent on how close or far the pretraining data and the target LT data might be as follows. The  calibration process improves the pretrained model on the LT dataset by learning a newly attached classifier. The distillation supervision from the frozen feature vectors and the classifier logits are adversarially balanced in a data-driven manner. Thus, if the pretraining data covers the target LT classes, our distillation emphasizes more on frozen feature vector supervision and vice versa, all without needing human tweaking. This design choice allows us to use a wide array of LT datasets (15 in total) with the **same** methodology and still achieve superior performance.\n\n> Motivation: Why is this a long-tailed method?\n\n$\\to$ It is because the calibrate part of the proposed calibrate and distillation is used specifically so that the distillation stage can work whether the pretraining data covers the target LT classes or not (please refer to our answer on the question regarding Setup). In addition, the multi-scale training is more effective for binary LT as binary LT is more prone to the data-scarcity in long-tailed classes (please refer to our answer to reviewer udmW on question A). We will revise the manuscript to better reflect on this in the revision soon.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, as this is a new (eG2e), compelling (udmW), and relevant (HnuF) problem for the community, we strived to introduce a general framework which showed strong performance (udmW, HnuF) but was open to modifications down the road.\n\n> Baselines\n\n$\\to$ We cordially argue that as there was no prior work on binary LT, we did our best of using the same binary backbone architecture (which already incorporates some of the techniques mentioned in the pointed paper) for all compared methods and ours. \n\nIn addition, for certain instances where the performance was too low (*e.g.*, DiVE with binary networks), we swapped out the part that was causing the low performance with some of our proposed components (*e.g.*, the teacher network part in DiVE) and created a better baseline (*e.g.*, DiVE*) which we also compare with (please see Table 1 & 2).\n\n> Missing references: \n\n$\\to$ We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out the work. We will review them in the related works section in the revision and incorporate some of the mentioned techniques into our calibrate & distill framework."

One of the underlying motivations for addressing the long-tailed recognition problem stems from the inherent imbalances frequently encountered in natural datasets.\n- It is advisable to update the set of compared methods in the experimental evaluation, as the current selection appears somewhat outdated. A more comprehensive comparison with contemporary methodologies is suggested.\n- The mechanism by which the parameter $\\lambda_\\phi$ facilitates generalization across multiple data distributions remains unclear. In Figure 6, it is evident that, across all datasets, $\\lambda_\\phi$ consistently converges to a value of 1, indicating that towards the conclusion of the training process, improvements are predominantly focused on the classifier rather than the encoder.

                        "value": "> Limited novelty\n\n$\\to$ While we definitely agree that we are standing on the shoulders of giants, we argue that the calibrate and distill framework which uses pretrained models in the context of LT (or binary LT) is novel (fEHn).  In addition, the way we use the knowledge distillation (KD) is different from most of the KD methods (*e.g.\u201d, distilling feature extraction and classifier information with learnable balancing parameters) with application of adversarial learning on the balancing parameters being novel. Lastly, learning multi-resolution inputs in the proposed way is novel and computationally efficient. \nOrthogonally, our contribution also lies in introducing a new and important problem (eG2e, udmW, HnuF) to the community, whilst also providing a simple yet strong baseline (udmW, HnuF) that is void of bells-and-whistles for ease of modification to the research community.\n\n> Scalability concern, given its utilization of a teacher model of substantial size. Notably, in Table 2, only single-resolution is utilized, primarily due to VRAM limits.\n\n$\\to$ We cordially argue that the scalability concern is not critical for multiple reasons. First, we can simply calculate the teacher model\u2019s output on the dataset beforehand which will substantially reduce VRAM overhead. Second, the multi-scale training is not integral to our calibrate and distill framework. If we did not have enough VRAM to utilize it, we could simply forgo it and still obtain good performance. Last, at the rates in which VRAM size is advancing with today\u2019s hardware improvement, we believe that the size of our teacher models are not that limiting with regards to VRAM.\n\n>  Practicality of incorporating non-LT pretrained models in advance.\n\n$\\to$ As great efforts have been devoted into curating publicly available large-scale datasets that are balanced such as ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21K, we argue that obtaining non-LT pretrained models in advance is indeed not difficult, $i.e.*, quite practical. We also note that we do **NOT** assume that a pretrained model is trained on either LT or non-LT distributions. Instead, we utilize a cheap calibration process (training only a linear classifier) for the pretrained model, which makes it possible to utilize the pretrained model as a distillation teacher no matter what the pretrained data distribution was. Empirically, the calibration noticeably improves the performance by more than 10% compared to using a non-calibrated teacher (please see Tab 3 for the ablation studies).\n\n> Update the compared methods.\n\n$\\to$ We will definitely update them for the final version. But we believe that the strong performance of CANDLE,  as noted by other reviewers (udmW, Hnun, HnuF) as well,  is enough to provide empirical validations..\n\n> Mechanism of \\lambda_phi. In Figure 6, it is evident that, across all datasets, \\lambda_phi consistently converges to a value of 1, indicating that towards the conclusion of the training process, improvements are predominantly focused on the classifier rather than the encoder. If the variation in the scheduling of \\lambda_phi is considered essential for enhancing generalization, a more thorough explanation is needed.\n\n$\\to$ As $\\lambda_\\phi$ approaches the value of 1, the binary encoder is primarily trained with the supervision from the pretrained model\u2019s feature extractor (please see Eq. 4), which is inline with the reviewer\u2019s comment and also mentioned in Sec. 4.3 of the paper.  However, as pointed out, the scheduling of the $\\lambda_\\phi$ is important for generalization as it varies substantially from dataset to dataset. Our formulation of $\\lambda_\\phi$ allows a schedule to be learned solely by the target LT data and not by humans. This makes it applicable to multiple target LT datasets without the need for human intervention.\n\n> How large teachers help when there is a significant domain gap.\n\n$\\to$ Thank you for the interesting question. Currently, the teacher models with the size as used in our work perform well for addressing domain gaps such as from ImageNet to Places dataset. While we are also curious about the effect of teacher model size on the performance of addressing domain gaps, the experimental undertaking is not trivial for two reasons. First, it is difficult to quantify the domain gap, which makes plotting the teacher size vs its effect on addressing the domain gap hard. Second, isolating the effect of teacher size scaling is hard as the architectural differences of differently sized models also have an effect. Thus, we leave this as an interesting future research avenue.\n\nMeanwhile, to better address larger domain gaps, we believe that improving the calibration process to better handle the large domain gaps given the same model size budget also could be another interesting future work (*i.e.*, gaining hints from the transfer learning and domain adaptation literature)."
