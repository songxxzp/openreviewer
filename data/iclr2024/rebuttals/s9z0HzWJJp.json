                    "value": "This work tries to propose an open-ended lifelong learning environment designed for developing autonomous agents that can perform human-like and up-to-date analysis and decision-making on societal topics. To do so, the environment SocioDojo is structured to emulate the historical development of society using real-world texts and time series data. \n\nSpecifically, it 1) integrates a continuous stream of real-world texts and messages from various information sources, including news, social media, reports, and more. The information in the form of time-stamped messages, ensures that the agents are exposed to up-to-date societal developments, forcing them to analyze and respond to fresh data.\n2) incorporates a vast array of time series data spanning various societal aspects like finance, economics, politics, and social trends.\n3) incorporates multiple knowledge bases and tools, including books, journals,  encyclopedias, interfaces to search engines and knowledge graphs, etc.\n\nWith the environment, the task of the agent is called \"Hyperportfolio Task\". They are given an initial \"cash\" value and are tasked with making \"investments\" in different \"assets\" that correspond to various time series. The goal is to maximize their total assets over a specified period, just like investment and asset management in the real world.\n\nIn this work, the author also proposes the Analyst-Assistant-Actuator agent architecture to tackle the hyperportfolio task, and the Hypothesis and proof prompting technique for generating high-quality analysis, which achieves improvements of 32.4% and 30.4% in two experiment settings compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The ablation study results show 1)the importance of domain-specific analysis techniques and high-quality information sources. 2)The analyst is critical for the hyperportfolio task."

Such as the prohibition of \"day trading\"  ensures that agents don't exploit short-term fluctuations but instead focus on understanding and predicting more meaningful, long-term societal trends. \n\nOverall, I do believe the complexity of the hyperportfolio task could set a high bar for LLM-based agents, challenging the community to rise to the occasion."

We have taken your comments into careful consideration and offer the following detailed responses:\n\n\n## For the Weaknesses:\n\n\n> 1. While the SocioDojo environment is comprehensive and emulates the running of the world, its complexity might make it challenging for researchers to quickly adapt.\n\nWe acknowledge that the comprehensive nature of SocioDojo presents a learning curve. To provide some help to assist researchers in navigating this complexity, we have included a new figure in Appendix D. This figure provides an overview of the collaborative decision-making process involving the Analyst, Assistant, and Actuator, offering a clearer understanding of their roles and interactions within SocioDojo.\n\n\n> 2. I think it would be beneficial to introduce some actual real-world classic scenarios or investment cases. These could serve as short-term goals or benchmarks, allowing researchers to run and evaluate their own model in a phased manner. It could also be useful for evaluating the information coverage level of the system.\n\nIntroducing real-world scenarios and investment cases is indeed a valuable suggestion. We plan to develop and include these examples in SocioDojo to serve as benchmarks and to enhance the system's evaluation in terms of information coverage and real-world applicability.\n\n\n> 3. The lower bound of the system is not clear. The complexity of SocioDojo might inadvertently obscure the foundational or simpler strategies that also be effective. For instance, SOTA time-series forecasting methods could be employed as a foundational strategy for investment within the SocioDojo environment. It could serve as a baseline or a lower bound against which more complex strategies can be compared.\n\nWhile SOTA domain-specific models in areas like quant finance could provide a foundational strategy within SocioDojo, our focus is on creating fair baselines with autonomous agents geared toward general socio-intelligence. However, incorporating expert domain models and tools into the agent's analysis process presents an exciting future direction, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for tool utilization.\n\n\n> 4. I also hope the author put more discussion on how the authors have addressed potential biases, screened sources, and ensured the diversity of data, it would bolster the paper's credibility and address potential concerns.\n\n\nTo address potential biases and source diversity concerns, we have added Appendix B, detailing our methodologies for screening sources and ensuring data diversity. \n\n\n## For your Questions:\n\n\n> 1. Are there any data leakage between the knowledge base and the streaming messages?\n\n\nTo prevent data leakage, we have strictly used only materials published before the start date in the knowledge base. \n\n---\n\nWe hope these responses comprehensively address your points and enhance your understanding of our project. We greatly appreciate your constructive feedback and remain open to any further inquiries or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for your support and valuable contribution to our work's development."

                        "value": "We greatly appreciate your thoughtful feedback and acknowledgment of our work on SocioDojo. After careful consideration of your comments, we offer the following responses:\n\n\n## For the Weaknesses:\n\n> 1. Since GPT-3.5-Turbo was used as foundation models with a non-zero (0.2) temperature, the results should not be fully deterministic, while the paper may miss some studies on randomness.\n\nWe choose a non-zero setting as 0 temperature may restrict the model performance. While the chosen temperature of 0.2 (on a scale of 0 to 2) is relatively low and aligns with recommendations for deterministic tasks, we recognize the value of further exploring how varying temperatures might affect outcomes. We are currently conducting additional studies on this aspect and plan to include these findings in future updates of our work.\n\n\n> 2. The setting of \"Forbid day trading\", that an asset cannot be sold within 5 days of purchase to avoid profiting from short-term patterns, might be overly strict.\n\nThe stringent \"Forbid day trading\" rule was designed to elevate the cost of decision-making, thereby promoting depth and consideration in the agents' analyses. This aligns with our goal of fostering high-quality, thoughtful decision-making. Additionally, our use of daily close price data, which are public while minute-level data are usually commercial, necessitates such a restriction to counterbalance the potential information advantage that agents might have due to data delays. We have added Appendix D to examine the implications of utilizing close price data.\n\n\n> 3. For the experimental setting of \"tracking\", it remains unclear how the portfolio performs against an actual index tracker.\n\nIn response to your query about portfolio performance in the \"tracking\" experimental setting, we have added a comparison with major indices like S&P 500 and FANG+ in Appendix C. This comparison helps contextualize our agent's performance, although it's important to note that SocioDojo has not been explicitly optimized for financial market environments. The direct comparison may not be fair considering the agent's unique advantages and disadvantages, such as not adhering to trading hours and not utilizing real-time data, along with the restriction against day trading.\n\n\n\n## For your Questions:\n\n> 1. When multiple news articles sent out on the same day, did the order of news matter? i.e., to which extend the agent is permutation invariant?\n\nIn SocioDojo, each news piece is timestamped to maintain chronological order, mirroring real-world scenarios. Overlaps in timestamps are rare, but even if they occur, they accurately reflect real-life information flows, ensuring that the agent's response is realistically grounded.\n\n---\n\nWe hope these responses address your concerns and provide further clarity on our research. We are grateful for your feedback and remain open to any additional questions or suggestions you might have. Thank you once again for your valuable input and for the opportunity to enhance our work."

Is there any specific reason that the authors do not consider the standard deviation?\n2. In Table 1, it is shown that there would be 9 research papers per day. Is this an average statistic or subscribed information that will constantly have 9 papers?\n3. How does the \u201creturn\u201d of \u201chyperportfolio\u201d change over time? How is the final \u201creturn\u201d distributed across different time periods?\n4. For some of the time series, e.g. GDP as an economic time series, we would have existing forecasting beforehand. They might be part of the report, and the model can directly use these numbers, which are typically fairly accurate. In this case, how do you confirm that the agent utilizes the comprehensive information from different sources to make the \u201cinvestment\u201d instead of directly taking those numbers?\n5. Financial time series is typically the most noisy one compared with other time series, which should also be the least predictable. However, it is shown that the financial time series achieves the highest return. How do authors interpret such results?\n6. Typos: equation 3.1.2, Table 3.2.1 and Figure 3.2.1 are not pointing to the correct place and are not indexed correctly. Table 1 in the Knowledge Base part should be Table 2."

Those notations are not used in other parts at all.\n\nWe appreciate your observation regarding the use of POMDP in our manuscript. In Section 3.2, we clarify how SocioDojo implements the POMDP environment, with information sources forming the observation space $\\Omega$, time series approximating the world state $S$, and the knowledge bases as context $Z$. This formulation in POMDP terms offers a structured and compact mathematical framework, enhancing the manuscript's comprehensibility and providing a common language for future research in this domain.\n\n\n> 2. The main evaluation results are only based on a final return in the defined period, which misses other important aspects for the results to be valid.

However, I still have some concerns regarding (1) if using existing forecasting is a legitimate strategy, then it's probably more reasonable to also include reliable existing forecasting as baselines. (2) It remains a bit unclear how long would the agent hold for each time series, which might shed some light on the decision of the agent. For example, this holding period may reflect the frequency of public forecasting.

A positive return does not necessarily mean that a wise decision is made. Take GDP as an example, since a lot of countries have positive growth, it's fairly easy for an agent to invest in such a time series and obtain a reasonable positive return.\n\nSincerely,\n \nReviewer apFV"

Regarding your concerns:\n\n> (1) if using existing forecasting is a legitimate strategy, then it's probably more reasonable to also include reliable existing forecasting as baselines. \n\nWe acknowledge there exist reliable domain-specific models in fields like quantitative economics and algorithmic trading. However, their focus differs from ours, our main focus is on general societal intelligence rather than domain-specific expertise. Such generality allows their applications to be extended beyond traditional time series forecasting such as business planning and social science research, as outlined in the introduction. Yet, directly competing with experts in all fields without domain-specific optimizations is not the target. We agree that comparison with domain experts can provide important insights into specific applications, but it will go beyond the main focus of this work. \n\n> (2) It remains a bit unclear how long would the agent hold for each time series, which might shed some light on the decision of the agent. For example, this holding period may reflect the frequency of public forecasting. \n\nThe holding period for each time series is dynamic adjustments with multiple buy/sell operations in different amounts at different time points. Thus, there is no determined holding period for a time series. We recognize the value of visualizing these holding periods can provide useful insights. Considering the rebuttal period is limited, we will incorporate this into future revisions. \n\n\n> (3) The return of hyperportfolio as an evaluation metric of an agent is not easy to interpret, especially with so many time series combined together. A positive return does not necessarily mean that a wise decision is made. Take GDP as an example, since a lot of countries have positive growth, it's fairly easy for an agent to invest in such a time series and obtain a reasonable positive return.\n\nWe have handled your concern on time series like GDP in **Section 3.2.2:** ***\"Since some assets are almost ever-growing, such as GDP, which leads to risk-free returns, we wish all returns to come with risk, thus requiring good analysis to achieve a better risk-return trade-off.\"*** and further detailed in **Appendix C Robustness Analysis of SocioDojo**. We introduced mechanisms like overnight rate and explored the proper settings by experiment to eliminate \"risk-free\" returns for such time series to ensure every positive return can reflect an improvement in societal understanding and decision-making. We agree that developing more intuitive evaluation metrics for agents is an essential aspect of our future work, but also challenging akin to evaluating a fund in the real-world financial context.\n\n---\n\nWe hope this response can address your concerns and aid in the further evaluation of our work. Your feedback is invaluable, and we remain open to any further questions or suggestions you may have.\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nAuthors of Submission 2968"
