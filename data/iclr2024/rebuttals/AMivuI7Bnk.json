Novelty: the novelty of this work might not be enough. Overall, it transforms the state-wise expectation constraint into a cumulative discount expectation constraint (which is fairly simple) and solves the safe RL problem in a TRPO way (which doesn't show novelty as well).\n\n3.

(especially the proofs of main theorems reported as supplementary material). Also, the overall clarity might be improved. For example, the introduction of MMDP lacks a formal definition of the up-to-now state-wise costs in the augmented CMDP, leading to ambiguity in understanding the extended transition dynamics. Equations like Equation 11 that combine discounted state-distribution over infinite horizon and undiscounted state distribution over a finite horizon lack clear theoretical justification. In the experimental metrics, the absence of a clear definition of the cost rate also impacts the interpretability of the results in the figures.\n\n### Significance:\nThe paper addresses an important area in the field by focusing on constrained MDPs with state-wise constraints. A better development, both in theory and practice, of the current approach might have potential significance for the community."

However, the manuscript lacks clarity in justifying the necessity of this new formalism. \nFurthermore, the paper lacks a theoretical discussion on the solvability of MMDP in relation to existing formalisms, opting instead to employ approximate methods to demonstrate its efficacy in high-dimensional problems. \nTo improve the theoretical grounding of this new formalism, I would expect a more in-depth presentation and discussion on its necessity, along with a theoretical characterization of its solvability.\n\nAmong the contributions that differentiate the current work from the existing methods, in the practical implementation section, the authors introduce a sub-sampling technique to train the maximum state-wise critic. The evaluation of it is confined to a very limited setting (specifically, a single experiment on Drones-3DHazard-8) without comparative reference performance from baseline methods (Figure 6). Although a comparison of performance can be inferred by checking the previous figure (Figure 4.d), the consistency of the proposed techniques across various experiments remains unclear. It would be beneficial to expand the evaluation to multiple experiments to ascertain the consistency and generalizability of the proposed sub-sampling technique."

                    "value": "Other observations/questions that would improve the clarity of this work:\n - The paper initially claims optimization to fulfill hard state-wise cost constraints but defines the set of safe policies based on expected state-wise cost constraints, which are not \"hard.\" This inconsistency is also acknowledged by the authors at the end of the paper.\n- The augmented CMDP introduces up-to-now state-wise costs M_i in the state, yet lacks a formal definition of these costs and the extended transition dynamics for the M_i components.\n- Equation 11 combines discounted state-distribution over an infinite horizon and undiscounted state distribution over a finite horizon within the same optimization problem. The rationale behind this mix and its theoretical justification remain unclear.\n- Baseline algorithms are re-implemented by the authors, and the manual tuning of hyperparameters (as detailed in the Appendix) might not be adequate for a comprehensive comparison. Given the sensitivity of current RL algorithms and the significance of implementation details, employing stable implementations from RL libraries and automatic hyperparameter tuning is crucial.\n- The absence of a clear definition of the cost rate diminishes the interpretability of the results in the Figures 1, 4. It seems that the range of the cost rate depends on the problem and does not converge to zero for any algorithm, leading to personal uncertainty in understanding the metric correctly.\n- Some claims within the paper appear to be hasty conclusions. For instance, in section 6.2, the authors state \"End-to-end safe RL algorithms fail since all methods rely on CMDP to minimize the discounted cumulative cost...\" This might not entirely represent the situation, as numerous factors, such as tuning and algorithmic implementations, could significantly influence performance in this setting rather than solely attributing it to the CMDP framework.\n- Figure 5 demonstrates the max state-wise cost for the proposed SCPO algorithm. It would be valuable to compare this with the max state-wise cost for the other baselines for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n- Figure 6 exhibits the impact of sub-sampling for the Drone environment. As already said, it would be equitable to visualize the effects of this technique across all environments and tasks to provide a complete evaluation of practical implementation strategies."

In particular, the proofs of the main theorems reported in the supplementary material repeatedly report entire chunks of text from Achiam et al.\n\nFor example, comparing Appendix A - Preliminaries with 10.1.1-2 in Achiam et al.:\n- The text surrounding Eq.17 and 18 is the same as the text of Eq. 17 in Achiam et al. apart from a few words.\n- The proof of Lemma 1 is the exactly same as in Lemma 1 and Eq.19 in Achiam et al.\n- The text before Eq. 21 is the same as before Eq. 20 in Achiam et al.\n- Lemma 2 adapts the math and reports the same text of proof of Lemma 2 in 10.1.2 of  Achiam et al. \n\nThis continues for the rest of the section and further evidence can be provided during the discussion.\n\n### Other reasons\nMany references in the introduction and related work look unrelated to the actual text and cite the same author or group of authors, suggesting a potential high-number of self-citations which is in my opinion beyond the tolerance. For example, in the introduction, after the statement \"There is a fundamental limitation that it is impossible to guarantee hard state-wise safety during training without prior knowledge of the dynamic model (Zhao et al. 2021; 2022; 2023b)\".\n\nThe reported three citations from Zhao et al. are not too related to the statement, which is rather generic. \nMoreover, looking at the references, 8 over 33 cited works comes from this author."
