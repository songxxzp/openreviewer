Several techniques to apply the rejection, estimate an optimal threshold, and evaluate the performance of classifiers have been proposed. The suitability of these methods strongly depends on the classification task, as every domain and particular application has its own requirements and thus different costs for rejects and misclassifications. For this reason, it's very hard to establish a general rule to perform this task.\nMoreover, to the best of my knowledge, all the previous works perform the threshold tuning on a validation set from the same distribution of the training set, adding in some cases synthetic data (for instance through data augmentation). The knowledge of the \"threat\" is not considered, as it does not represent a realistic setting. \nThe obtained results are not surprising: if the rejection mechanism is \"fitted\" to reject data from a certain distribution, the performance is better. Adding other unrelated data makes the rejection of the considered threat harder, as the reject regions will be more complex - but it has to be considered that the classifier will be able to reject data from different distributions."

Isn't the point of threshold-independent metrics like AUROC and AUPR that different applications will have different tolerances for different kinds of error? This is widely recognized in binary classification and in the OOD detection research community, so it seems a bit odd to have thresholds be the unit of evaluation. It's useful to know whether thresholds that are good for one metric are also good for other metrics, but there is still a fundamental ambiguity about the requirements of the problem. There is a substantial literature on cost-sensitive learning that goes one step further in formalizing this, which would be good for the authors to discuss."

If the focus of a paper are empirical findings, the experimental design should be motivated more thoroughly and any findings should be phrased by mentioning the limitations of the experimental design. \n2. The introduction and abstract of the paper are formulated quite generally. The contribution should be limited and results should be mentioned in more detail.\n3. For me the focus of the paper, threshold search for runtime monitors, could guide the first four pages of the paper more. The authors could describe in more detail what they mean by monitoring and what differentiates the monitoring techniques they chose to assess, and why they chose them. Similarly the choice of threats could be motivated and explained in more detail.\n4. The presentation in the first four pages obscures simple concepts and leaves many important questions unanswered. For instance, I wonder what the relation is between $f$ and $m_f$ and further what threat data can entail. Table 1 took me a long time to understand whereas it only says that the test data only contains target threat data that was not used in the training data set and no other generic threat data.\n5. The experimental study is not repeated over multiple seeds. It is not clear how high the variance of the results are.\n6. The choice of aggregating the results over multiple experimental settings might obscure findings. There are other ways to present complex experimental results. First, the non-aggregated results could be presented in the appendix. Second, plots with differently colored and shaped markers could be used."

Can the authors find a better word for \u201cOODness\u201d, maybe just OOD or \"what constitutes as OOD\"?\n3. What is the difference between $f$ and $m_f$? \n4. In the work of Arampatzis & van Hameran (2001), does the effectiveness measure depend on the ground-truth labels of the test data?\n5. Weaknesses of the analysed approaches were not discussed. Can the authors think of any?\n6. Paragraph headings should be in small caps and also the usage of an em dash for additional separation is not necessary.\n7.
