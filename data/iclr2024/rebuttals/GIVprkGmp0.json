This paper first illustrates this phenomenon by theoretical and numerical analysis, concluding that with conventional initialization schemes, both vanilla GCN and ResGCN are inclined to over-smoothing in terms of the FSP, BSP and GEV metrics. To tackle this issue, the authors propose SPoGInit, a layer-wise initialization approach aiming to optimize the above metrics. SPoGInit achieves performance enhancements in the node classification task in various datasets."

Otherwise, it is hard to say whether the theoretical results make sense or not.\n2. The motivation of this paper is unclear: why do we need deep GNNs? According to experimental results on deep GNNs of previous works and also this paper, deep GNNs do not significantly outperform shallow ones on most datasets. In addition, deep GNNs have much larger model sizes and training costs. Then what is the motivation for deepening GNNs? Is it just GNNs are models in deep learning and so they have to be deep?\n3. Lack of comparison. Please compare the proposed method with other approaches (i.e., those listed in the related work section) for improving deep GNNs performance."

A notable example is Virgo [2], which has been specifically devised for GNNs. To provide a comprehensive evaluation and validate the effectiveness of their proposed method, it is crucial for the authors to include such GNN-specific initialization methods in their experimental comparisons.\n\n\n2. **Novelty of the Proposed Method**: \n   - The proposed SPoGInit method bears a conceptual resemblance to MetaInit, while SPoG-ResGCN shares similarities with ReZero. The authors briefly mention these two prior works in the Appendix, dedicating only a few words to them. Given the substantial similarities, a more thorough and detailed discussion is needed, preferably within the main body of the paper, to critically examine and delineate the differences and advancements made by their methods in comparison to existing ones.\n   - The Graph Embedding Variation (GEV) is conceptually identical to concepts proposed in previous works, specifically referenced in [1].\n   - The theoretical derivations heavily rely on frameworks previously applied to conventional neural networks. While the findings are applicable to GCNs, they do not significantly deviate from those associated with conventional neural networks. Considering that GCNs inherently deal with graph-structured data, an initialization method that more directly reflects and leverages the unique properties of graphs is expected.\n\n3. **Improper Evaluation**: \n   - The evaluation predominantly relies on the ogbn-arxiv dataset, where the authors claim a 2.2% improvement in test accuracy with increasing network depth. However, the homophilous nature of ogbn-arxiv means it doesn\u2019t significantly benefit from deeper architectures. In fact, state-of-the-art performance on this dataset surpasses that achieved by SPoGInit, and interestingly, these results were obtained using shallower GNNs. The heavy focus on this particular dataset in the experimental evaluations does not adequately justify the need to address the 'curse of depth' and is insufficient to validate the effectiveness of SPoGInit across diverse graph structures and datasets.\n\n\n[1] Samuel S.
