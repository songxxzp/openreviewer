While the authors provide an example that Adam works but SGD fails, there may exist more examples under which Adam fails but SGD works. The results in this paper do not provide insights into the conditions under which Adam is likely to fail, as well as the efficiency of Adam in deep learning.\n\n3.

Therefore, the authors proposed the very first convergence result of Adam without assuming the L-smoothness. The L-smoothness is replaced by a (L_0, L_1)-smooth condition, where the norm of Hessian matrix can be upper bounded by a linear combination of constant and gradient norm."

However, L-smoothness does not hold in practical settings (e.g., training of DNNs), so the main focus in this paper is to weaken the assumption to $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness. The authors show that Adam can converge to a bounded region even under this weaker assumption. Moreover, they also demonstrate the Adam's benefit over SGD by comparing the upper bound of Adam's convergence rate with the lower bound of the SGD's."

                    "value": "1. One of the main theorems (Theorem 4.1) is very weak.\n\n(i) It says that unless $ D_0=0 $, the convergence rate of Adam is worse than SGD. One has to choose very large $\\beta_2$ to converge to $\\epsilon$-stationary points. As the second term in RHS of formula (4) is of order $1/(1-\\beta_2)^2$, and one has to choose $(1-\\beta)^2=\\epsilon^2$ to make the second term of (4) on the RHS to be small, then $\\beta_2$ has to be $1-\\epsilon$, and hence $T$ has to be $O(\\epsilon^{-8})$ to make the first term of RHS of (4) to be less than $\\epsilon^2$. This is much worse than the complexity of SGD. In this setting, the SGD complexity indeed depends on the magnitude of gradient on a sublevel set, but this quantity can be bounded by smoothness constants and independent of $\\epsilon$. The $\\epsilon$ dependency of SGD is still $\\epsilon^{-4}$. Therefore this contradicts the main claim of this paper about the \"provable benefit of adaptivity in Adam\".\n\n(ii) The Theorem 4.1 requires $O(n\\epsilon^{-8})$ gradient calls to find $\\epsilon$-stationary points, because the RR-Adam algorithm described in Algorithm 1 denotes $k=1,\\ldots,T$ as $T$ as epochs, not $T$ iterations. The hidden $n$ dependency makes this paper extremely weak. For example, there is a simple baseline that significantly dominates RR-Adam analysis in this paper: one can run gradient descent with clipping as in [Zhang et al. 2019a] in a deterministic case (e.g., every epoch), then the number of gradient oracle calls is at most $O(n\\epsilon^{-2}$) (Theorem 3 in Zhang et al. 2019a).\n\n(iii) The provable benefit of Adam is proved in [Li et al. 2023] and they prove the $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ gradient complexity of Adam in the setting of stochastic optimization, which I believe is more general than the finite-sum setting as considered in this manuscript and they achieved a much better complexity results.\n\n2. The presentation of the proof of Theorem 4.1 is very difficult to read. There are too many \"constants\" (e.g., from $C_1$ to $C_{13}$ on Page 18) which depend on each other. I suggest the authors to highlight which term is dominating and what are their orders.\n\n3. The lower bound results are standard extensions of existing lower bounds in [Zhang et al. 2019a, Crawshaw et al. 2022]. As I saw from the proof, the hard instances are the same and the proof idea is also closely following these prior works. The only main difference is concatenating two 1-dimensional instances from previous works to a single 2-dimensional instance. I think this is a very marginal contribution.\n\nOverall, although this paper studied an interesting problem, the upper bound results are too weak and dominated by previous works, and the lower bound results come from straightforward extensions from previous works. Therefore I recommend rejecting this paper."

However, due to the brevity of the rebuttal period, we are unable to complete this process in time and have decided to withdraw the paper. We would like to address a point of contention regarding the comparison of our work with that of [Li et al., 2023], which we believe to be both unfair and inappropriate.\n\n* Firstly, our draft was submitted to flagship conferences nearly a year before [Li et al., 2023] made their submission to arXiv, and our work was even cited by them. We believe that drawing a comparison under such circumstances is not correct.\n\n* Secondly, the analysis presented in our paper holds true when $\\lambda = 0$. Here, $\\lambda$ represents a term added to $\\sqrt{\\nu_t}+\\lambda$ to improve numerical stability and can be as minimal as $10^{-8}$. Contrarily, Li et al., [2023] operates under the assumption that $\\lambda>0$, which creates a vastly different framework. This assumption allows the adaptive learning rate to be instantly upper-bounded, significantly simplifying the analysis. Conversely, in our proof, deriving the upper bound of $\\sqrt{\\nu_t}$ presents a central and complex challenge. The bounds provided by [Li et al., 2023] show a polynomial dependence on $1/\\lambda$, which could potentially result in an extremely loose bound. We acknowledge and appreciate the contribution of [Li et al., 2023] in providing an $O(1/\\epsilon4)$ rate in the stochastic setting. However, due to the stark differences in setup, as discussed above, comparing our work with theirs is not even meaningful."
