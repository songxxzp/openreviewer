The authors try to find a motivation from the similarity between positive and negative pairs to support such a modification. However, after reading the paper, I do not feel the observations in Fig. 1 correlate much with the proposed method.\n2. As for the paper writing, probably due to the limited contributions in the method design, the authors spend a lot of space reviewing previous contrastive learning methods, which is not informative. The authors also provide the connection of the loss with the maximum likelihood estimation, which is also not novel and has few differences with existing literature.\n3. Though the experiments show the proposed method enhances the performance, it is not surprising since it introduces more learnable parameters including the temperature, whose effectiveness has been proved in previous works."

                    "value": "+ Empirically, multiple projection heads may not introduce more diversity of image representations, since a wider MLP projection head can achieve the similar target. A wider MLP head also provides larger capacity for image representations, whereas the results in SimCLR paper reports that wider MLP projection doesn't achieve more performance gain than the narrow one. So, as the wider MLP projection head, I don't think multiple projection heads can address the proposed problem.\n\n+ The relationship between more diverities of image representation and inaccurate similarity problem in plain contrative methods (as clarified by athous) is not well clarified. The aim of projection head for contrastive objective is to capture the similarities but filter out the dissimilarities. Applying contrastive objective unavoidably removes some dissimilarities. More accurate learning targets may achieve better performance, instead of more projection heads.\n\n+ The design of temperature in Eq.3 is not well clarified. As understood by me, this design is not reasonable. As Eq.3, a more similar pair is normalized by lager temperature. It causes that the temperature normalized similarity scores of all pairs, including positive- and negative- one, are the similar ones. How to discriminate positive pairs from negative ones.\n\n+ The writing is somewhat confusing and can be furhter refined. The problems are listed in Question section.\n\n+ The results of SimCLR and SimSiam on CIFAR10 are obvious worse than the ones reported in SimSiam paper (SimCLR: 89.9 vs 91.1; SimSiam: 90.7 vs 91.8). The experimental results are not so convicing for me."

They are very important experiment details for this paper.\n\n+ The motivation of multiple projection heads and adaptive temperature should be clarified more clear. Why it works by analysis?\n\n+ Eq.3 and Eq.4 are confusing. I also believe that Eq.4 is wrong.\n\n+ For better convicing experimental reuslts, the authors should compare their results with the ones reported on the original paper.\n\n+ The number of sampled pairs for Figure 6 should be more."

Although the effectiveness of the two modules has been empirically verified by the performance improvement against baseline, it is still not clear enough why they work. In other words, some discussion on the mechanisms of the two modules could be further clarified and some qualitative analysis or examples of how the multiple projection heads and adaptive temperature affect the learned representations and similarity scores could be supplemented.\n2. This paper does not discuss the computational cost of using multiple projection heads and adaptive temperature, especially for large-scale datasets and models.\n3. The paper introduces some crucial hyper-parameters in Equations 4 and 6. Such hyper-parameters are varied in different experiments. it's essential to include ablation studies to explore the sensitivity of the proposed method to variations in the hyper-parameters. A more comprehensive analysis would provide a deeper understanding of the method's robustness."
