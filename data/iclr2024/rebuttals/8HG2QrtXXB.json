                    "value": "This paper is motivated by the classic Helmholtz decomposition to decompose fluid flow motions into curl-free and divergence-free parts. This is embedded into a multi-scale architecture and evaluated with multiple two-dimensional examples. Unfortunately, using Helmholtz for learning is a pretty \"classic\" topic even in the deep learning field, which the paper seems not to be aware of. Hence, the baselines do not take into account numerous approaches that have likewise used curl-based constructions in losses and as neural network layers."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "An important point I see with this submission is that it does not seem to be aware of the wide array of papers that use Helmholtz and curl constructions from the fields of deep learning and from the computer graphics. As the paper already targets CG-like flows, and cites several works from this area, I have trouble understanding why the authors have omitted all the classic works from this area.\n\nHowever, most important of course are directly relevant DL papers, that have used very similar constructs. The classic \"Accelerating eulerian fluid simulation with convolutional networks\" Tompson et al. ICML 2017 uses it in the loss,  and \"Deep fluids: A generative network for parameterized fluid simulations\" Kim et al. 2019 use it for inferring flow solutions, very closely related to the paper here. \n\nMany newer papers likewise use curl constructions, e.g. \"Curl-Flow: Pointwise Incompressible Velocity Interpolation forGrid-Based Fluids\" Chang et al. 2021, and \"Discovering Hidden Physics Behind Transport Dynamics\" Liu et al. 2021. Also closely related, just last year at ICLR 3D flows were synthesized using a multi-scale architecture with curl: \"Learning to Estimate Single-View Volumetric Flow Motions without 3D Supervision\"  Franz et al. 2023. None of these papers are cited, or compared to. This is a big omission, and leaves many questions open. Most importantly, whether there are any gains from the proposed approach over these already published works.\n\nIn addition, I would recommend citing and acknowledging the classic CG papers: Bridson's curl-noise paper, and derivatives such as \"Stream function solver for liquid simulations\" Ando et. al 2015. Beyond this, the related work in terms of works from the DL field focusing on fluids also looks like it could be broadened and improved.\n\nBeyond the unclear advantages, I was also surprised that the paper focuses on extremely short prediction horizons. 10 steps do not seem like a state of the art for current DL-based simulators. I think it will be important to target much longer roll-outs in order to keep up with existing works. (I would expect the higher order time integration methods to relatively quickly cause trouble in these cases.)\n\nIn general, the appendix is quite sparse w.r.t. additional details. I think future revisions of the submission could also be improved by providing further ablations and details here."
                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "It is not intuitive to me why the Helmholtz decomposition should be enforced throughout the network, and on multiple scales. In the end, only the final output should adhere to this, and I would expect it to overly constrain the inner latent spaces of a network. Have the authors tried adding only a single layer at the end?\n\nIt's crucial for a fair comparison to keep the number of network parameters similar. Why have the authors chosen to vary them so widely? There's a factor of 20x between smallest and largest in Table 9. Along those lines, 10m for a 64x64 flow seem huge. I would recommend to add an ablation for different sizes.\n\n---\n\nPost-rebuttal comments:\n\nI want to thank the authors for the updates and their replies. However, I really cant understand why the authors are trying to argue that their \"task\" is not the simulation of a fluid, but rather an inverse problem of inferring velocities from some observed state. To quote the abstract \"we propose the HelmSim toward an accurate and interpretable simulator for fluid\" , and the main body continues like this. If the goal of the paper is really _not_ the simulation of fluids, but some derived inverse task, I would recommend to reflect this in introduction and the presentation of the method and rewrite them accordingly. However, if the goal is simulating fluids after all, I think it's important how the method fares for actual simulation tasks using velocities and central input output quantity (instead of only focusing on velocity estimation tasks). \n\nI do evaluate this paper based on its currently stated objectives, i.e. simulating fluids, and for this 10 steps are clearly not sufficient. Current learning-based methods typically focus on hundreds or thousands of steps. As such, I will keep my score. I don't think this paper should be published at ICLR in its current form, but would require some fundamental revisions that should be carefully checked by reviewers.\n\nTable 12 also contains the stream only / curl only versions. I think future versions of the paper should make clear that \"curl only\" is widely used in the DL community already. Being very close to the full version, this seems to give the majority of the gains."

The experimental results are reported as single relative L2 errors. Are these compared over networks trained on various random seeds, or how was this single value chosen? Ideally we can see a statistically significant improvement with the proposed model.\n3. More detail should be added on the boundary condition inclusion, how is this implemented in an efficient manner?\n4. The last sentence on page 4 should have hats on the states $x_T$ and $x_{T-1}$, is that correct?\n5. Figure 9 shows an efficiency comparison, is it correct to assume the y-axis performance is equivalent to accuracy of the model? Higher is better? Why would HelmSim be at the lower end of the spectrum then? Especially since it's the second slowest model in runtime. \n6. The number of parameters is different between each model, it would make sense to make a fair comparison where the same number of parameters was provided for each model. In this particular case, FNO was provided roughly 9x less parameters to train on. The number of parameters should ideally also be mentioned in the main text.\n7. Figure 10 should be presented in a more quantitative manner. The boundary condition errors do not look significantly different, it would help to know what sort of percentage difference on average it has on the overall prediction error."

So what about staying in simulation, would the model easily generalize to that?\n2. It was unclear until the multiscale integration network section that we were operating with a Lagrangian and not a Eulerian fluid learning setup, since we are learning a velocity field and using this to advect field quantities. Is this interpretation correct?\n3. In the experimental results, the authors mention that the blurry predictions from U-Net \"impede its practicability\". In what application areas will these models be applied? \n4. The argument for why directly estimating the velocity will overwhelm the model in the ablation study is not very convincing. Is that not what the other baseline models are already capable of?"

                        "value": "Many thanks to Reviewer 2nz9 for providing the insightful review and comments.\n\n> **Q1:** It is unclear what the observed state is at all.\n\nFollowing the reviewer's suggestion, we have added the observed state information in $\\underline{\\text{Appendix A.1 of revised paper}}$.\n\n> **Q2:** Are these compared over networks trained on various random seeds, or how was this single value chosen?\n\nSorry for this missing information. We repeated all the experiments three times with seeds randomly selected from 0 to 1000. The presented results are the mean value of three repeated experiments.\n\nExperimentally, the standard deviations of relative L2 are smaller than 0.001 for Navier-Stokes, Bounded N-S and Sea temperature and smaller than 0.003 for Spreading Ink. For scientific rigor, we keep four decimal places for all results. We have included this in $\\underline{\\text{Appendix A.2 and A.3 of revised paper}}$.\n\n> **Q3:** More details about boundary condition inclusion.\n\nAs we presented in $\\underline{\\text{Eq. (4) of original submission}}$, we add the boundary condition to the correlation calculation process. A detailed description is also added in $\\underline{\\text{Appendix A.2 of revised paper}}$.\n\n> **Q4:** Typo of the last sentence on page 4.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have corrected this typo in the $\\underline{\\text{revised paper}}$.\n\n> **Q5:** Explanation of Figure 9: Efficiency comparison.\n\nSorry for the misleading y-axis label. The y-axis is Relative L2, which means that a smaller value refers to better performance. We have rephrased this figure in the $\\underline{\\text{revised paper}}$.\n\n> **Q6:** FNO with roughly 9x less parameters to train on compared to HelmSim. Compare HelmSim to FNO with similar model size.\n\nFirstly, we want to emphasize that all the baselines are compared with their official configurations in their paper, which means FNO is proposed as a lightweight model.\n\nFollowing the reviewer's suggestion, we enlarge the FNO parameter and compare it with HelmSim as follows. We can find that, even with sufficient model parameters, FNO still performs worse than HelmSim.\n\n| Model                       | Relative L2 in 64 \u00d7 64 Navier-Stokes | Model parameter |\n| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------- |\n| FNO (offical configuration) | 0.1556                               | 1,188,641       |\n| FNO (enlarge model)         | 0.1524                               | 10,633,265      |\n| HelmSim                     | **0.1261**                           | 9,929,101       |"

                        "value": "Thank you to the authors for the extensive replies to all the reviewers, and for grouping the concerns into specific categories.\n\nThanks for including so much extra detailed information in the appendix, that will ensure reproducibility and clarity of the paper. Indeed, the comparison with FNO is very much appreciated, and now clearly shows the improvement of the proposed HelmSim approach. The additional section to 3D is perhaps slightly weak, since as the authors mentioned, it is a larger challenge within the community, and it would have been a great addition to see realized within this paper.\n\nOn the topic of how directly learning the velocity \"overwhelms\" the model, the way this could be understood is that we craft a simpler representation where the solution is easier to learn. Which goes into engineering features for neural network representations. In this case it is interpretable, yet it remains unclear if this decomposition-based representation is either the easiest to learn or the most physically interpretable. Where one would rather use dimensionality reduction techniques for the first, and potentially directly learn velocities and pressures for the latter. This is only a small comment to add, and perhaps a bigger problem challenge to tackle in the future.\n\nOne concern still remains, and perhaps has been amplified by the extra experiments, that the improvement feels somewhat incremental. Same with learning velocity directly, where it is a slight trade-off of runtime/memory for accuracy. It would be great if the model outperforms all baselines by a small amount, but excels in specific scenarios. This one specific scenario is what is missing to make this an excellent paper as opposed to a good paper.\n\nHowever, the answers from the authors, in addition to the extensive benchmarks, have proven satisfactory and convinced me to improve my score. Thank you once again for clarifying a lot of the points,"

Notably, the absence of the multi-head mechanism leads to a performance drop (0.1261 -> 0.1344) for the 64x64 Navier-Stokes, which is somewhat comparable to the performance decrease resulting from the ablation of the Helmholtz decomposition (0.1261 -> 0.1412). These results raise questions about the model's overall performance gain compared to the baseline models when the multi-head trick is absent. Additionally, the ablation studies need to be explained more comprehensively with sufficient details, as the current presentation makes it difficult to understand the methodology and outcomes.\n  - The paper claims that Vortex (Deng et al., 2023) cannot be tested on other datasets, which seems unusual, as they are the same type of task and data that are disconnected from the choice of dynamics modeling itself. It should be further clarified why Vortex cannot be applied to other datasets.\n- Interpretability Claim:\n  - The paper's claim about interpretability is not well-explained. If the interpretability claim is based on the model's prediction of an explicit term of velocity, it needs further comparison and a more comprehensive explanation. Does the Helmholtz decomposition significantly improve interpretability compared to baseline models, such as Vortex (Deng et al., 2023)?\n  - In Figure 4, it appears that the model predicts incoherent velocity fields around the circle boundary, even with non-zero velocity outside the boundary, while baseline models do not exhibit such artifacts. This weakens the interpretability claim.\n- Multiscale modeling: \n  - The aggregation operation after \"Integration\" needs further clarification. Please provide more details in the main paper, and if you refer to other architectures, acknowledge their structure properly.\n- Regarding some missing experimental results with cited baselines, it's crucial to include and report all baseline results to ensure transparency, even if the outcomes are considered inferior.\n- Minor issues: \n  - Ensure proper citation format for baseline models (Authors, Year).\n  - Make sure that symbols are well-defined with clear reference to their definitions. For example, in Equation (4), the undefined operator $\\mathbb{I}_{\\vec r\\in\\mathbb{S}}$ needs clarification. If it's an indicator function, use standard notation with a proper explanation. \"Embed(\u2022)\" should be indicated more explicitly."

Since different video sequences have inherently different vortex trajectories, we need to re-train Vortex to fit every video sequence. However, the other three benchmarks, for example, the Navier-Stokes dataset, have more than 1000 different video sequences. It means that we need to train 1000+ Vortex models for these benchmarks, which is unacceptable. But as per your request, we still implement this experiment in $\\underline{\\text{Table 15 of revised paper}}$, where we train one vortex model on one single video sequence and generalize it to others. Here are part of the results. We can find that Vortex degenerates a lot.\n\n| 64 \u00d7 64 Navier-Stokes Dataset | Relative L2 |\n| ----------------------------- | ----------- |\n| Vortex                        | 8.1379      |\n| HelmSim                       | 0.1261      |\n\n#### **Section 2: Interpretability Claim**\n\n> **Q4:** Does the Helmholtz decomposition significantly improve interpretability compared to baseline models?\n\nAs we keep emphasizing in defining \"Helmholtz dynamics\" in $\\underline{\\text{Section 3.1}}$, HelmSim not only learns the velocity field but also estimates the potential and stream functions of fluid. We believe that this design surpasses other baselines in learning \"physically interpretable evidence\", not just the velocity fields.\n\n> **Q5:** In Figure 4, the model predicts non-zero velocity outside the boundary.\n\nSorry for this misleading visualization. Since the Spreading Ink dataset is only within the circle boundary, we only compute the loss within the boundary. Thus, the part outside of the boundary is without restriction.\n\nWe have added the implementation details in the $\\underline{\\text{Appendix A of revised paper}}$.\n\n#### **Section 3: Multiscale modeling**\n\n> **Q6:** The aggregation operation after \"Integration\" needs further clarification.\n\nWe conduct this operation following U-Net. As per the reviewer's suggestion, we have included details in the $\\underline{\\text{Appendix A.2 of revised paper}}$."

The error map looks similar except for a narrow region. What is the L2 error with and without the Helmholtz dynamics? What is the computational overhead for training with Helmholtz dynamics? Moreover, the error map looks the same for including and not including the boundary condition terms, making it hard to understand the benefits of including the boundary terms.  Can you also include the ablation study for the multihead, multiscale structure of your proposed model to demonstrate their effects?\n\n5. The author mentioned that 3D fluid field is hard to observe, so they focus on the 2D cases, which is a false statement. There are many advanced techniques to observe the 3D fluid fields like PIV. It is more like the limitation of the current method that only works on 2D cases."

In 2D cases, we set the the velocity component on the $z$-axis to zero, that is $\\mathbf{A}_x(\\mathbf{r})=\\mathbf{A}_y(\\mathbf{r})=0$. To extend HelmSim to 3D fluid, the key point is to change the HelmDynamic block into learning 3D potential and stream functions $\\widehat{\\Phi}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{1\\times D \\times H\\times W}$ and $\\widehat{\\mathbf{A}}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times D \\times H\\times W}$, where $D$ is the additional depth dimension of 3D fluid. Then, following the Helmholtz decomposition presented in $\\underline{\\text{Eq. (1) of revised paper}}$, we can easily obtain the inferred 3D vector velocity field, thereby enabling HelmSim to achieve the velocity-aware 3D fluid prediction.\n\n> **Q2:** What are the Reynold numbers for the cases? How is your method's performance on turbulence?\n\nSorry for this missing information. The Reynold number for the Navier-Stokes dataset is about $10^4$, and for the Bounded N-S dataset is about 300.\n\nTo better evaluate the performance of the turbulence dataset, we experimented with a turbulence dataset provided by TF-Net [1]. We strictly followed its setting and reported the RMSE for predicting future 20 timesteps. In this dataset, Helmsim still perfroms best. These results have also been included in $\\underline{\\text{Appendix D of revised paper}}$.\n\n| Turbulence Dataset | HelmSim     | FNO     | UNet    | MWT     | U-NO    | LSM     | TF-Net  |\n| ------------------ | ----------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\n| RMSE               | **1042.38** | 1187.44 | 1062.13 | 1276.64 | 3276.09 | 1069.26 | 1061.78 |\n\nReference: \n\n[1] Wang, Rui, et al. \"Towards physics-informed deep learning for turbulent flow prediction.\" KDD. 2020.\n\n> **Q3:** Missing movies for the predictions to check for temporal coherence.\n\nFollowing the reviewer's suggestion, we have provided the prediction movies in the $\\underline{\\text{revised supplementary material}}$, where HelmSim achieves favorable temporal coherence."

After that, we may not have a chance to respond to your comments.**\n\nSincere thanks for your dedication! We are looking forward to your reply."
