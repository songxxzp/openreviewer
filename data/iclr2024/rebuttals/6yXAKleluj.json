It is necessary to describe the main contributions of the study and clearly explain how the existing challenges are addressed. Furthermore, as a key technology involved in this research, TRW should be introduced with more details, such as what specific temporal features are used and how they interact with spatial features, if applicable. Additionally, it is not clear which 7 features are extracted and why they were selected. Were they chosen based on findings from other existing studies? An example to demonstrate a sample and how the spatial and temporal patterns are involved would be helpful. \n\n+ Regarding the ground truth\n\nAfter reading the Empirical Analysis section, it feels that the anomaly detection results are not validated against any ground truth. In other words, it is unclear whether the detected anomalies represent actual threats. Furthermore, from the description stating, \"by changing the threshold, far more anomalies could be detected,\" it appears that the accuracy of anomaly detection depends on the chosen threshold. This raises the question of how to determine the threshold in practical applications.\n\n+ Lack of comparison with existing approaches\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction section, there are numerous related studies that employ various sampling methods. Liu et al. (2023) is introduced as an approach that \"combines historical information over time\". However, none of these approaches is considered as a benchmark method. It would be better and necessary to provide more experimental results demonstrating that the proposed approach offers a superior solution."

At the same time, we would like to request the reviewer to see the innovation in the context of blockchain network; as anomaly detection in Ethereum is quite complex with the challenge of not having readily available ground truth for anomalies. Here is our response to your comments and questions:\n\n\\section*{1. Presentation and Writing of the Paper:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The paper has been structured to clearly present the main contributions (page 2), particularly focusing on the Temporal Random Walk (TRW) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) methodology for anomaly detection in the Ethereum network. The empirical analysis section and the use of figures aim to make the presentation more understandable (Pages 8-9).\n    \\item TRW is introduced on page 3 with a focus on its ability to encapsulate temporal sequences and correlations of transactions to detect anomalies (page 4). It also explains how TRW impacts GCN performance, particularly in the context of Ethereum. This includes mathematical justification and algorithmic representation of the TRW-GCN combined method (page 11-14).\n    \\item The paper details the extraction and selection of 7 features, emphasizing their relevance in anomaly detection. These features include incoming value count, activity rate, change in activity, and time since the last transaction. The selection is based on their ability to capture spacial and temporal dynamics, which is crucial for detecting anomalies (Page 6-7).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{2. Paper Theory Contributions:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We aimed to prove three theorems in this paper (Section 2.3):\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item ``Enhanced Anomaly Detection in GCNs through Temporal Random Walk Integration'' (see page 4, 5).\n        \\item ``TRW sampling maintains higher temporal consistency than traditional random walk sampling'' \u2013 added to section 2.3.\n        \\item ``Improvement of GCN performance with probabilistic sampling in the context of random walk sampling'' (see appendix)\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{3. Experimental Results Against Ground Truth:}\n\\begin{itemize} \\item There is a lack of readily available ground truth for anomalies in Ethereum transactions; as we started on page 4, In our work, the term `anomaly' refers to patterns that are statistically uncommon or divergent from the norm based on the features learned by our model. These uncommon patterns, while not definitively erroneous, are of interest because they deviate from typical behavior. In the context of Ethereum transactions, such deviations could potentially indicate suspicious activities, novel transaction patterns, or transaction bursts.'' \\item Ethereum, being a blockchain platform, records all transactions in a public ledger. These transactions include not just simple transfers of Ether. The variety of transaction types and the complexity of smart contract interactions make it difficult to establish a clear baseline of normal'' behavior. \\item What constitutes an anomaly in Ethereum transactions can be subjective and context-dependent. For instance, a transaction pattern that seems unusual in one context might be perfectly normal in another. \\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{4. Comparison and Validation of Experimental Results:}\n\\begin{itemize} \\item We evaluate the TRW-GCN methodology using four distinct machine learning techniques: DBSCAN, SVM, Isolation Forest (IsoForest), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Page 7). This comparative analysis, especially in the context of different block sizes in Ethereum, demonstrates the effectiveness of the TRW-GCN approach over traditional methods. This also underscores the importance of algorithm selection, indicating a higher false positive rate with clustering methods. \\item We also discuss the convergence of GCNs and TRW, emphasizing our approach in refining anomaly detection methods. This includes comparing different clustering and scoring methods to decrease false positives in detecting anomalous activities. \\item We used 7 features for anomaly detection including outgoing_tx_count, incoming_tx_count, outgoing_value_count, incoming_value_count, activity_rate, change_in_activity, time_since_last (the last three are time-based features), that we added to detect time-sensitive transaction anomalies, and we showed that in Figure 2 that our TRW-GCN method distinguishes and detects such time-sensitive anomalies. \\item We further introduced a scoring function for displaying nodes with an anomaly score beyond a certain threshold, section 3.3, using a z-score threshold of 2.0 (95% confidence). This is part of the methodology to identify anomalous nodes in the Ethereum network dataset (Page 7-8). We made a comparison between 4 features (without time-sensitive features) and 7 features (with time-sensitive features) to assure that with TRW-GCN method, we could detect more anomalies. \n\\end{itemize}\n\\end{document}"

Lack of ablation experiment: While the paper presents the theoretical benefits of the TRW-GCN framework, there is a need for empirical evaluation to demonstrate its tangible benefits. Comparing the performance of GCN with and without TRW on a temporal dataset would provide more evidence of the model's effectiveness.\n3. Lack of intuitive visualization of experimental results: The paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the superiority of the TRW-GCN framework, but the visualizations and figures provided are not clear and do not effectively convey the findings.

Paper Theory Contributions}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We aimed to prove three theorems in this paper (Section 2.3):\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item ``Enhanced Anomaly Detection in GCNs through Temporal Random Walk Integration'' (see page 4, 5).\n        \\item ``TRW sampling maintains higher temporal consistency than traditional random walk sampling'' \u2013 added to section 2.3.\n        \\item ``Improvement of GCN performance with probabilistic sampling in the context of random walk sampling'' (see appendix).\n    \\end{enumerate}\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{2. Lack of Experimental Results Against Ground Truth}\n\\begin{itemize} \\item There is a lack of readily available ground truth for anomalies in Ethereum transactions; as we started on page 4, In our work, the term `anomaly' refers to patterns that are statistically uncommon or divergent from the norm based on the features learned by our model. These uncommon patterns, while not definitively erroneous, are of interest because they deviate from typical behavior. In the context of Ethereum transactions, such deviations could potentially indicate suspicious activities, novel transaction patterns, or transaction bursts.'' \\item Ethereum, being a blockchain platform, records all transactions in a public ledger. These transactions include not just simple transfers of Ether. The variety of transaction types and the complexity of smart contract interactions make it difficult to establish a clear baseline of normal'' behavior. \\item What constitutes an anomaly in Ethereum transactions can be subjective and context-dependent. For instance, a transaction pattern that seems unusual in one context might be perfectly normal in another. \\item The Ethereum blockchain is continuously evolving, with new smart contracts and transaction types emerging regularly. \\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{3. Comparison and Validation}\n\\begin{itemize} \\item We evaluate the TRW-GCN methodology using four distinct machine learning techniques: DBSCAN, SVM, Isolation Forest (IsoForest), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Page 7). This comparative analysis, especially in the context of different block sizes in Ethereum, demonstrates the effectiveness of the TRW-GCN approach over traditional methods. This also underscores the importance of algorithm selection, indicating a higher false positive rate with clustering methods. \\item We also discuss the convergence of GCNs and TRW, emphasizing our approach in refining anomaly detection methods. This includes comparing different clustering and scoring methods to decrease false positives in detecting anomalous activities. \\item We used 7 features for anomaly detection including outgoing_tx_count, incoming_tx_count, outgoing_value_count, incoming_value_count, activity_rate, change_in_activity, time_since_last (the last three are time-based features), that we added to detect time-sensitive transaction anomalies, and we showed that in Figure 2 that our TRW-GCN method distinguishes and detects such time-sensitive anomalies. \\item We further introduced a scoring function for displaying nodes with an anomaly score beyond a certain threshold, section 3.3, using a z-score threshold of 2.0 (95% confidence). This is part of the methodology to identify anomalous nodes in the Ethereum network dataset (Page 7-8). We made a comparison between 4 features (without time-sensitive features) and 7 features (with time-sensitive features) to assure that with TRW-GCN method, we could detect more anomalies. \\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{4. Clarity of Visualizations}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The paper includes figures to demonstrate the effectiveness of the TRW-GCN framework in anomaly detection. However, the reviewer's concern about the clarity and interpretability of these visualizations is noted. The paper could benefit from improving the quality and clarity of these figures to make the experimental results more intuitive and easier to understand. For instance, we made Figure 1 and 2 bigger and more clear. We numbered all the equations. Figure 3 compares anomaly detection in different block sizes with varying features, in Figure 2, we explained the importance of time-sensitive feature selection with different colours. In Figure 4, we illustrated the improvement on GCN performance using random walk sampling.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{document}"

Gaps in the Literature}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We have stated the literature gaps on page 2.\n    \\item  see ``Potential Contributions'' on page 2, where we introducd the effectiveness of TRW in detecting anomalies, and suggested the importance of temporal patterns in identifying irregularities..\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{2. Readability Improvement}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The paper has been structured to clearly present the main contributions (page 2), particularly focusing on the Temporal Random Walk (TRW) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) methodology for anomaly detection in the Ethereum network. The empirical analysis section and the use of figures aim to make the presentation more understandable (Pages 6-7).\n    \\item All equations were numbered, and the font size of Figure 1 and 2 were increased.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{3. Proofs are Short}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The proofs provided in the paper are concise, focusing on the fundamental aspects of the methodologies used. We added proof of theorem 2 in section 2.3.  The paper also includes proof of theorem 3 in the appendix, demonstrating analytically how probabilistic sampling can improve GCN performance. This brevity is due to the focus on empirical analysis and practical application.\n    \\item We aimed to prove three theorems in this paper (Section 2.3):\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item ``Enhanced Anomaly Detection in GCNs through Temporal Random Walk Integration'' (see page 4, 5).\n        \\item ``TRW sampling maintains higher temporal consistency than traditional random walk sampling'' - added to section 2.3.\n        \\item ``Improvement of GCN performance with probabilistic sampling in the context of random walk sampling'' (see appendix page 12-14).\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \\item Section 3.2 mainly concerns the empirical analysis for the 1st theorem.\n    \\item Section 3.4 mainly refers to the empirical analysis done for the 3rd theorem.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{4. Overall Novelty Compared to Current State of the Art}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The novelty of this research lies in its integration of TRW with GCN for anomaly detection in the Ethereum network. This approach is particularly innovative in its focus on the temporal sequences and correlations of transactions, a gap not extensively explored in existing literature. We suggest that this methodology offers a more refined lens for anomaly detection, capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics in Ethereum transaction data. \n    \\item On page 2, we stated the literature gap and our potential contributions. This represents a significant advancement in the field.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{5. Evaluation Metrics / Tabular Data}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We evaluate the TRW-GCN methodology using four distinct machine learning techniques: DBSCAN, SVM, Isolation Forest (IsoForest), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Page 6-7). This underscores the importance of algorithm selection, indicating a higher false positive rate with clustering methods.\n    \\item We also discuss the convergence of GCNs and TRW, emphasizing our approach in refining anomaly detection methods. This includes comparing different clustering and scoring methods to decrease false positives in detecting anomalous activities.\n    \\item We used 7 features for anomaly detection including outgoing\\_tx\\_count, incoming\\_tx\\_count, outgoing\\_value\\_count, incoming\\_value\\_count, activity\\_rate, change\\_in\\_activity, time\\_since\\_last (the last three are time-based features), that we added to detect time-sensitive transaction anomalies, and we showed that in Figure 2  that our TRW-GCN method distinguishes and detects such time-sensitive anomalies.\n    \\item We further introduced a scoring function for displaying nodes with an anomaly score beyond a certain threshold, section 3.3, using a z-score threshold of 2.0 (95\\%). This is part of the methodology to identify anomalous nodes in the Ethereum network dataset (Page 8). We made a comparison between 4 features (without time-sensitive features) and 7 features (with time-sensitive features) to assure that with TRW-GCN method, we could detect more anomalies.\n    \\item We also compared the accuracy of three GCN models on full graphs and subgraphs, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional random walk and temporal random walk in capturing essential graph properties (Page 9). \n    \\item Although the paper extensively uses Figures for data representations. In Figure 3, we showed the list of addresses for detected anomalies, however lack of further tabular data is due to the nature of the data and the methods used, which would be more effectively represented visually. Including tables could enhance the clarity of results and comparisons, making it easier for readers to understand. We are still bound by the 9 pages though.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{document}"

At the same time, we would like to request the reviewer to see the paper novelty in the context of blockchain or the Ethereum network.Anomaly detection in Ethereum is quite complex with the challenge of not having readily available ground truth for anomalies. This issue arises due to the nature of blockchain data and the complexity of defining what constitutes an anomaly in such a decentralized and diverse environment. To this end, we believe the paper presents a novel approach using available baseline and evaluation metrics. \n\n\\section*{1. Incomplete Sections and Hypothetical Theorems:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We aimed to prove three theorems in this paper (Section 2.3):\n    \\begin{enumerate}\n        \\item ``Enhanced Anomaly Detection in GCNs through Temporal Random Walk Integration'' (see page 4, 5).\n        \\item ``TRW sampling maintains higher temporal consistency than traditional random walk sampling'' - added to Section 2.3.\n        \\item ``Improvement of GCN performance with probabilistic sampling in the context of random walk sampling'' (see appendix page 11-14).\n    \\end{enumerate}\n    \\item Section 3.4 referred to the empirical analysis done for our 3rd theorem for which the proof was presented in the appendix (page 11-14). All the subsections related to \"Theorem (Hypotehetical)\" in Section 3.4 have been removed.\n    \\item by ``Potential Conclusions'' we meant ``Potential Contributions''in the context of Ethereum network and effectiveness of TRW in detecting anomalies (Page 2).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{2. Lack of Proper Baselines in Experiments:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item There is a lack of readily available ground truth for anomalies in Ethereum transactions; as we started on page 4, ``In our work, the term `anomaly' refers to patterns that are statistically uncommon or divergent from the norm based on the features learned by our model. These uncommon patterns, while not definitively erroneous, are of interest because they deviate from typical behavior. In the context of Ethereum transactions, such deviations could potentially indicate suspicious activities, novel transaction patterns, or transaction bursts.''\n    \\item Ethereum, being a blockchain platform, records all transactions in a public ledger. These transactions include not just simple transfers of Ether. The variety of transaction types and the complexity of smart contract interactions make it difficult to establish a clear baseline of ``normal'' behavior.\n    \\item What constitutes an anomaly in Ethereum transactions can be subjective and context-dependent. For instance, a transaction pattern that seems unusual in one context might be perfectly normal in another.\n    \\item The Ethereum blockchain is continuously evolving, with new smart contracts and transaction types emerging regularly. This dynamic nature means that what is considered normal can change over time, further complicating the establishment of a static ground truth.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section*{3. Inappropriate Evaluation Metrics:}\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We evaluate the TRW-GCN methodology using four distinct machine learning techniques: DBSCAN, SVM, Isolation Forest (IsoForest), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) (Page 7). This comparative analysis, especially in the context of different block sizes in Ethereum, demonstrates the effectiveness of the TRW-GCN approach over traditional methods. This also underscores the importance of algorithm selection, indicating a higher false positive rate with clustering methods.\n    \\item We also discuss the convergence of GCNs and TRW, emphasizing our approach in refining anomaly detection methods. This includes comparing different clustering and scoring methods to decrease false positives in detecting anomalous activities.\n    \\item We used 7 features for anomaly detection including outgoing\\_tx\\_count, incoming\\_tx\\_count, outgoing\\_value\\_count, incoming\\_value\\_count, activity\\_rate, change\\_in\\_activity, time\\_since\\_last (the last three are time-based features), that we added to detect time-sensitive transaction anomalies, and we showed that in Figure 2 that our TRW-GCN method distinguishes and detects such time-sensitive anomalies.\n    \\item We further introduced a scoring function for displaying nodes with an anomaly score beyond a certain threshold, section 3.3, using a z-score threshold of 2.0 (95\\% confidence). This is part of the methodology to identify anomalous nodes in the Ethereum network dataset (Page 7-8). We made a comparison between 4 features (without time-sensitive features) and 7 features (with time-sensitive features) to assure that with TRW-GCN method, we could detect more anomalies.\n    \\item we also compare the accuracy of three GCN models on full graphs and subgraphs, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional random walk and temporal random walk in capturing essential graph properties (Page 9).\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\end{document}"

The theorems are not rigorous.\nIn the previous versions, the authors use the term 'hypothetical' in the theorem, which does not indicate a rigorous theorem. The current revised version expands the proof a bit and removes the word \"hypothetical\". However, the proofs are still not mathematically rigorous.\nFor example, the statement: \"If the anomaly is temporally influenced, then h\u2032_n should be significantly different from h_n due to the weights introduced by T_nj\". This is not a mathematically rigorous statement. In fact, the statement may not be true, as the weight in T_nj may cancel out, giving a similar value to the case without the weight.\n\n2. The experiments are not rigorous.\nThe lack of ground truth in the experiments indicates that the experiment setup is not conducted properly. One can always detect more anomalies just by shifting the threshold used by the model. Arguing that finding ground truth in Ethereum data is hard is not helping to make the experiment sounder. \nMany unsupervised anomaly detection papers that face similar problems, overcome it by either gather anomalous samples, or simulate anomalous patterns to the datasets.\n\n3. The baselines are not sufficient\nThere are many GNN-based anomaly detections that can be used as baselines, including some models that incorporate temporal information, like many CTDG-based models. None of the baselines are included in the experiments."
