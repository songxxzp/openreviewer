                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The main weakness of the method is its sensitivity to the number of principal\ncomponents to include, $k$. Figure 5 shows that accuracy varies hugely (by 20 to\n30 percent) if we don't choose exactly the right value for $k$. Comparatively\nthe method achieves modest gains (1 to 3 percent) compared to previous work. The\naccuracy drops happen even if we change $k$ by just 1 or 2. The authors state\nthat they cannot automatically determine the optimal parameter value for a\ndataset.\n\nIn the Introduction, the authors state that previous methods have \"lack of\nguidance on finding optimal prompts\" in contrast the the presented method. I\ndon't think this is true as previous methods (including Auto-CoT) are very\nsimilar; the most significant difference is the way the questions to include in\nthe prompt are selected, which is using PCA in the presented method.\n\nConnected to this, some claims the paper makes are too extensive in my opinion,\nlike the presented method being \"an innovative mathematical solution\" which\n\"aims to develop a deep understanding on how to design CoT prompting\".\n\nThe algorithm itself is presented as if it would be a novel algorithm inspired\nby PCA, but I think it's actually PCA without making the data zero mean. I found\nsome of the explanations (e.g., linear independence, some parts of PCA, the\nproof for using SVD to compute PCA) superfluous.\n\nA weakness of the evaluation is that the authors used gpt-35-turbo instead of\nthe widely used davinci model. This makes the results very different from\nprevious work (e.g., the CoT paper reported 46.9% accuracy on GSM8K and 68.9% on\nSVAMP with GPT 175B compared to 75.8% and 80.2% in the present paper). Even\nthough gpt-35-turbo may outperform davinci, it would be good to report those\nresults too for the sake of comparison to previous work.\n\nSome smaller issues:\n- I think that in-context learning is not a prompt engineering technique as\n  stated in the abstract.\n- In the Introduction, the authors state that CoT prompting demonstrates that\n  the reasoning ability of LLMs perfectly matches the scaling laws. I believe\n  this should be rephrased as these scaling laws are not mathematically exact to\n  be perfectly matched.\n- In the first paragraph of 4.2, I think some text is missing from \"average of\n  3.2% in Table 2\"."

In addition, many of the design choices (e.g., the question set for each task, number of basis questions $k$, choice of the embedding model) are not well justified and seem to be determined based on the best test set performance (which could mean info-leaking on the test set).\n\n- For doing SVD over a question set: end of page 4, step 1 \"Embedding questions\", the authors said there are $m$ questions in a task, which they further used to embed and construct a matrix to select the top k basis questions from. Where do those $m$ questions come from? The training set or the test set of each task? and what is $m$ for each task? Note both zero-shot CoT and few-shot CoT are completely unsupervised and do not require a training dataset.\n\n- Optimal number of basis questions: In the beginning of section 4, the authors mentioned \" 3. Prompt Space can determine the optimal number of basis questions for significantly improving the performance of\nLLMs on each dataset. \". However, in section 4.4, the authors said \"there remains a challenge that we cannot automatically determine the optimal number of basis questions for each dataset\". Can the optimal number of basis questions be automatically determined or not? Based on Figure 5, there is a big discrepancy on the performance depending on the number of basis questions, how is the final performance determined in Table 1 and 2? Is it based on which k gives the best test performance?\n\n- Which embedding models to use: in Section 4.3, different embedding models give quite different results, for example, if choosing a different embedding model, the proposed method's performance could be worse compared to the baselines. Why choosing the MiniLLM:384 as the embedding model? Is it again based on the test set performance?"
