The agent is capable of generating instructions, invoking various tools, and detecting stereotypes in generated images. The authors construct a benchmark dataset based on toxic text datasets to evaluate the agent's performance and find that text-to-image models often display serious stereotypes related to gender, race, and religion. The results highlight the need to address potential ethical risks in AI-generated content. The paper contributes a comprehensive framework for stereotype detection and emphasizes the importance of addressing biases in AI-generated content."

Additionally, there is a need to ensure that the benchmark dataset used for evaluation is diverse, representative, and free from any additional biases. Creating a dataset based on toxic text datasets may introduce additional ethical considerations, such as the potential for harm to individuals or communities whose data is included in those datasets. The paper should be reviewed from an ethics perspective to assess the potential impact and implications of the research on society, and to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to mitigate any harmful effects."

In our study, we attempted to increase the diversity of evaluated samples by drawing from toxic text content datasets on various social platforms. Regarding the imbalanced distribution of subgroups, we would like to clarify that Figure 3 illustrates the proportional distribution of instruction pairs obtained during the initial text extraction process, which is biased towards specific subgroups. It is important to note that this distribution does not represent the training data. Instead, it highlights the strong stereotypes associated with certain subgroups in everyday expressions.\n2. In the Appendix section, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed agent framework, including an analysis of false positives, false negatives, and the impact of different parameters. We apologize for not making this clear in the main text and will revise accordingly.\n3. We compare our proposed agent framework with existing stereotype detection methods. It's important to highlight that these conventional methods rely on manually crafted prompts for comprehensive testing.\n\n| Bias dimensions | Ours     | Cho et al. [1] | Bianchi et al.

Our agent framework emphasizes the use of existing models to complete complex tasks. We add a more comprehensive justification for the selection of specific tools.\n5. We understand the importance of discussing the potential impacts and implications of stereotype detection in practice. In the revised paper, we provide a more thorough discussion of the unintended consequences of bias mitigation strategies, the role of human judgment in determining stereotypes, and the balance between freedom of expression and risk mitigation.\n\n6. In response to the concern about providing explicit recommendations or strategies for mitigating biases, we include a section discussing potential bias mitigation approaches and their implications in the revised paper.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Language agents for stereotype detection in text-to-image models may face limitations in accurately detecting subtle stereotypes or those embedded in complex contexts. Additionally, they may struggle with cases where stereotypes are expressed using sarcasm or irony. We discuss these challenges and potential solutions in the revised paper.\n2. For manual annotation, annotators were provided with guidelines that included descriptions and examples of stereotypes. They were instructed to determine the presence of stereotypes based on these guidelines. We provide more information about the criteria used for manual annotation in the revised paper.\n3. We apologize for the lack of detail regarding the annotation process. In our study, multiple annotators were involved, and we conducted an inter-rater reliability assessment to ensure consistency. We include this information in the revised paper.\n4. The toxic text datasets used to construct the benchmark dataset were selected based on their relevance to the task, diversity of content, and representation of various social platforms. We provide more details about the selection criteria and guidelines in the revised paper.\n\n\n\n[1] Jaemin Cho, Abhay Zala, and Mohit Bansal. 2022.

                        "value": "Regarding the technical novelty of our paper, we understand your point about the use of existing models and metrics. However, our primary contribution lies not in the novelty of the models or metrics, but in the innovative application of these tools. Our core motivation is to build a language agent that can perform task planning and effectively utilize various tools to detect and identify a broader range of stereotypes present in social media texts. Therefore, this agent overcomes the limitations of previous work that required exhaustive testing of all possible occupations and other descriptors to construct prompts. \n\nWe appreciate your concerns regarding open sourcing the code of our study. While we have included the code in the submission auxiliary materials, we understand the need for it to be easily accessible. Therefore, we commit to open sourcing the code in an easy-to-access format in subsequent papers. We will also provide ample examples to illustrate the seriousness of stereotypes in existing text-to-image models, further aiding in the understanding and reproduction of our work."

                    "value": "aper seems to try to do too many things and as a result I believe doing none of them sufficiently well and adding confusion to the paper:\n\nW1a. The paper is framed around the method proposing an autonomous agent for stereotype detection. This is a great vision, but the method seems to (a) follow a consistent, pre-determined sequence of actions for the task, and (b) it seems far from autonomous in relying on human intervention and a lot of custom steps (unique datasets, custom prompts, human feedback, etc) at every stage.  This to me is not a critique of the method but that it shouldn't be over-complicated or over-sold as an autonomous agent rather than a reliable process for red-teaming for stereotypes building on LLMs as a tool in that process.\n\nW2a. There has been a fair amount of work on sterotype detection which this work is not compared to and does not grapple with similar issues.  For example, what if there are multiple people in the same image?  How is the diversity and coverage of the generated concerns? When is this better than a curated list? For example, this claim is good but I'd like to experimental evidence: \"However, this approach to bias evaluation has its limitations, as it often neglects the more subtle stereotypes prevalent in everyday expressions. These biases frequently manifest in toxic content disseminated across various social platforms, including racial slurs\"\n\nW3a. [less critical] The method is framed as benchmarking but I think is better explained as automated red-teaming.  Because the metrics and distribution is less controlled, understanding this as a consistent benchmark seems challenging but the discovered issues are still important as in red-teaming.\n\nW2. Related to the above point, it is hard to gauge how diverse the stereotypes uncovered are and how diverse the images are.  (Are all imges generated with \"The people who ___\")"

While you pointed out the dependence on \"human intervention,\" it is crucial to note that, at the present stage, crafting well-written prompts manually remains a vital component in enhancing the performance of an agent. Our intention was to highlight the potential for autonomy rather than present a fully autonomous system. In light of your comments, we will revise our framing to better represent the current state of the method and potential future developments. \n\nW2a: We compare our proposed agent framework with existing stereotype detection methods. It's important to highlight that these conventional methods rely on manually crafted prompts for comprehensive testing.\n\n| Bias dimensions | Ours     | Cho et al. [1] | Bianchi et al.

We will revise our framing accordingly to ensure that the discovered issues are highlighted as important aspects of red-teaming, rather than focusing on consistent benchmarking.\n\n1. Questions:\nIn response to your questions, we would like to provide the following information:\n- Diversity of stereotypes: Our experiments uncovered more than 2800 prompts that simultaneously showed stereotypes pointing to one subgroup across multiple models. These prompts cover the special expression of \"verb + noun\" that was missing in previous studies, such as \"commit sadistic murders\" and so on.\n- Autonomy and flexibility of the agent: We acknowledge that our method currently involves human intervention and custom steps. However, our goal is to progressively refine these processes towards greater autonomy and flexibility for new tasks. \n\nRegarding the diversity of images, we would like to clarify that all prompts start with a fixed \"The people who ___\" to avoid the prefix prompt introducing additional stereotypes. This approach ensures that the uncovered stereotypes are solely attributed to the models and not influenced by the prompts themselves.\n\n\n[1] Jaemin Cho, Abhay Zala, and Mohit Bansal. 2022.
