It introduces a rewarding mechanism to parse and ground human knowledge in natural language form to the task space and produces an interpretable policy for each task in a task-agnostic setting. \n\nThe **challenge** it solves involves the need for the agent to adapt quickly to new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous tasks.\n\nLLIT promotes the sharing and reuse of knowledge among tasks that are closely related, all while mitigating the harmful effects of cross-task interference, which often leads to forgetting and poor adaptation to new tasks."

It would need quite a lot of improvement to get up to ICLR\u2019s standard in time for publication."

There is a lack of details throughout the paper, with decisions not being fully explained, many missing examples of parts of the process, and finally no Appendix to give any details for how most of this was parametrised and implemented. In this state this is not reproducible research.\n2. Several aspects of the model are not introduced well enough. Even though a lot of space is spent talking about how the LLM is used, and why using one is useful, I do not think I understand the details of how all components fit together still.\n3. Key parameters are not defined (e.g. D, alpha, lambda) and there is no Appendix to help.\n4. Overall the paper feels rushed and would need some iterations to reach ICLR\u2019s expected threshold."

                    "value": "1. What does CW provide, and what exactly are you modifying in it?\n   1. I had to look at their paper to see that it automates the data collection + policy learning aspect, there is no mention of any of that in the paper, to the point where I thought you were just using some offline RL data that was pre-collected?\n   2. How is the Auxiliary Reward model used? Where is it connected and how does it influence the behaviour?\n   3. How is the similarity reward used?\n   4. What parts of these are functions of time/observation or just constant per task?\n2. There are no details about the LLM behaviour and outputs.\n   1. What are the prompts used?\n   2. Why did you split them between task tips and task content?\n   3. What does the model output? You need to provide examples on a few tasks.\n   4. How do you obtain the observation and action specs? How would that inform how to solve the task?\n3. There are not enough details about the Grounding Tips to Policy section:\n   1. Why did you have to map the tips to the observation specs in the manner described in 3.2? What happens if you did not do that? Did you try other methods?\n   2. How is f_ARM trained? Is it trained? On what data? To predict what target?\n4. Section 3.3 contains many low-level details yet is not clear enough about what it presents.\n   1. It uses entirely different notation and semantics than what is in Figure 1. It is the \u201cModular Pool Model\u201d, correct?\n   2. Where is e_tn?\n   3. How are these trained? Which data, etc?\n5. Again Section 4 contains no details at all, or assumes full knowledge of what Continual World provides. This is not acceptable IMO.\n6. Section 5.1 uses different notation yet again and isn\u2019t clear enough\n   1. What is alpha? D? lambda?\n   2. Are these the most important parameters/aspects to modify?\n   3. What about the way to prompt the LLM?"

The paper evaluates LLIT on several CRL benchmarks and shows that it outperforms existing methods in terms of stability, plasticity, and generalization."

The similarity model is used for measuring the semantic similarity, and can not be used to provide reward signal. In this way, the auxiliary reward is not effective for policy learning.\n\nOverall, there lacks some figures (e.g., Effect of key hyperparameters, Fig 3), and some important information that support the proposed method.
