To this end, the authors propose a method called Online Label Shift adaptation with Online Feature Updates (OLS-OFU), the main idea of which is to utilize a self-supervised learning (SSL) technique to refine the feature extraction process of existing OLS algorithms. Experimental results are presented to verify the performance of their method."

Instead, we varied the severity of data shifts in the experiment and studied how OLS-OFU is influenced. Figure 2(b) shows the results under a mild severity of data shifts. Because the feature extractor is refined for the shift distribution and the violation of the label shift assumption is alleviated, OLS-OFU still benefits from the OLS module if we compare OLS-OFU with OFU. However, when the data is shifted with a higher level of severity, after the same feature refining, the violation of the label shift assumption cannot be controlled under a certain level so the OLS-OFU should not benefit from the OLS module. This is validated by the empirical results: as shown in Figure 3, OLS-OFU performs worse than the single OFU without any OLS module."

The results on several other datasets (STL10, CINIC, EuroSAT) are presented in Figure 5 and they actually show the same improvement pattern as the results for CIFAR10 (Figure 2). We agree that moving these results to the main paper will make the conclusion look more convincing. We will fix the pages in the revision.\n\n**Ablation study**: Thank you for raising this concern. We actually have done the main ablations for our method implied by the main results (Figure 2). We explain these ablations below: \n- The ablation for the OFU module. The OFU module in OLS-OFU can be studied by comparing OLS-OFU and OLS in the main result Figure 2. We can observe consistent improvement across all OLS methods, which demonstrates the advantage of the OFU module introduced in this paper.\n- The ablation for the OLS module. The OLS module in OLS-OFU can be studied by comparing OLS-OFU and OFU in the main result Figure 2. The improvement of OLS-OFU over OFU shows the superiority of the OLS module in the OLS problem. \n\nWe will highlight these comparisons in the revision. Moreover, in the last paragraph of the experimental section, we also studied whether to \"make predictions\" first or \"update $f_t$ to $f_{t+1}$\" first as an ablation study for the overall framework of OLS algorithms (as shown in Figure 1)."

Unlike the previous which focused on re-weighting the pretrained classifier or re-training the final linear layer of the classifier, this paper proposed to enhance the feature representation by leveraging the unlabeled data at test time. Specifically, a novel Online Label Shift (OLS) adaptation with Online Feature Updates (OFU), named OLS-OFU, was proposed by refining the feature extraction process through self-supervised learning (SSL). Theoretical analysis indicated that the proposed OLS-OFU could reduce the algoritmic regret by introducing the SSL. And the empirical results showed the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method under both the OLS setting and the online generalized label shift (OGLS) setting."

And the authors hypothesized that \"a similar effect can be leveraged in the generalized label shift setting\". However, I did not see strong relations between the drawbacks of the existing methods in this field and the lack of feature representation improvement. \n2. The theoretical support in this work is not well verified by the empirical results. In Eq.(5) of the draft, the math showed that the online updates yield improvements. However, this point cannot be theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, existing empirical results cannot reveal the relationship between the larger improvement and the better performance.\n3. Some algorithmic steps are a little confusing for the readers.\n\n\nSee Questions part for more details."

For example, why did you believe the feature representation learning has not been enough in the existing methods? Why should we introduce the feature representation improvement, and is there any empirical support? If we cannot explain this point, introducing self-supervised learning just looks like a naive combination of the online label shift adaptation with the popular topic, self-supervised learning.\n2. About the theoretical analysis in Eq. (5). I believe that the motivation of introducing the online feature updates comes from the assumption in this inequality. 5And the authors tried to provide empirical evaluations in Sec. 4 (and Appendix D.6) to verify the holdness of this inequality. However, there is no further demonstrations of the quantitative relationship between the amount of feature representation refinement (or in other words the tightness of Eq. (5)) and the final performance. I will describe my question in the mathematical way:\n\nSuppose $\\mathcal{M}$ denote the OLS methods (e.g., $\\mathcal{M}\\in${FLHFTL, FTH, ROGD,...}). Take $\\mathcal{M}=$FLHFTL as an example. \nLet \n$$X^{\\mathcal{M}}=\\mathbb{E}[ \\frac{1}{T} \\Sigma_{t=1}^{T}\\ell(f_{t}^{\\mathcal{M}-ofu}; \\mathcal{P}_{t}^{test})]$$\n\n$$Y=\\mathbb{E}[ \\frac{1}{T} \\Sigma_{t=1}^{T}\\ell(g(\\cdot; f_{t}^{\\prime\\prime}, q_t/q_0); \\mathcal{P}_{t}^{test})]$$ \n\nand \n$$Z=\\frac{1}{T} \\Sigma_{t=1}^{T}\\ell(g(\\cdot; f_{0}, q_t/q_0); \\mathcal{P}_{t}^{test})$$\n\nAccording to [1],  Then, the Eq.(3) can be rewrote as \n$$ X^{\\mathcal{M}} - Y  \\leq \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{K^{1/6}V_{T}^{1/3}}{\\sigma^{2/3}T^{1/3}} + \\frac{K}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}})$$\n\nIf we define $\\Delta = Z- Y$  as **the amount of improvement** ($\\Delta \\geq 0$ if we admit Eq. (5)). \nThen, introducing feature update can make the original bound in Eq. (4) tighter by $\\Delta$:\n$$X^{\\mathcal{M}} - Z \\leq \\mathcal{O}(\\frac{K^{1/6}V_{T}^{1/3}}{\\sigma^{2/3}T^{1/3}} + \\frac{K}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}}) - \\Delta$$\n\nThe larger improvement we make by feature update (in other words larger $\\Delta$), the tighter bound we can derive from the original version.\nThus, my question is: **could you please verify this point with empirical results to support your motivation in Eq. (5) in a quantitative manner?** Maybe we can fix an OLS method $\\mathcal{M}$, and then choose different ways to obtain $f_{t}^{\\prime\\prime}$ (e.g., different $\\ell_{ssl}$), then give a quantitative measure on the loss of $\\mathcal{M}$-OFU (i.e., $X^{\\mathcal{M}}$ defined above) with respect to the value of $\\Delta$?\n\n3. It seems the organization of the descriptions in Algorithm 1&2 is a little confusing and make the core steps of your methods less readable. For example, if we start Algorithm 1 from $t=1$, the step-1 of Algorithm 1 aims to return $f_{2}^{\\prime} \\leftarrow \\textit{OLS-R}$. However, in the details of this step shown in Algorithm 2, it seems we need $f_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}$ returned by the step-3 of Algorithm of the previous loop. I failed to get what is the exact definition of $f_{1}^{\\prime\\prime}$.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Online label shift: Optimal dynamic regret meets practical algorithms. NeurIPS 2023."

We agree that although our algorithm is theoretically motivated by Equation (5), stronger evidence between Equation (5) and the results can provide stronger motivation. To show this, we calculate the Pearson coefficient between the improvement from Equation (5) (RHS - LHS) and the improvement from OLS to OLS-OFU (i.e. loss$^{\\rm OLS}-$loss$^{\\rm OLS-OFU}$) across all experimental setups (dataset, online shift pattern, SSL method).  Pearson coefficient is between [-1, 1] and if it is positive, it indicates their positive correlation. The coefficients as evaluated are 0.70, 0.76, 0.54, 0.63, 0.58, and 0.75 when OLS is set as FTFWH, FTH, ROGD, ATLAS, UOGD, and FLHFTL respectively, which all show strong positive correlations. We will include this analysis in the revision.\n\n**Motivation of feature extraction refinement**: Please see our general reply \u201cClarifications on Contribution\u201d.\n\n**Definition of $f_1''$**: Thank you for raising this clarification question. Both $f_1$ and $f_1''$ are defined as $f_0$ initially. We will address this in the revision."

                        "value": "I appreciate the effort from the authors. However, I think the authors did not fully get my question. What I want to verify is whether the amount of performance improvement is highly related to the amount of feature representation improvement under different SSL methods. That is because according to my above analysis, if the theoretical guarantee holds, it seems that a better SSL method (i.e., with larger RHS-LHS in Eq. (5)) will probably lead to more significant performance improvement (e.g., final accuracies) for each OLS method and each dataset. In other words, it would be better if the authors could compare the RHS-LHS in Eq. (5) as well as the performance improvement under different SSL methods for each OLS method and each dataset. \n\nI also read the reviews from the other reviewers and I noticed that some reviewers (i.e., xmwo and 5U9r) also have more or less doubt about the motivation for introducing the OFU process with the SSL method. I believe that this is the base of the theoretical guarantee of this paper. Without this, it seems that the gap between the theoretical guarantee of introducing the OFU process and the empirical improvement cannot be fully bridged."

We will include tables in the appendix for completeness in the revision. \n\n**Experiments on the Imagenet and Imagenet-C**: Current OLS algorithms might not work very well when the number of classes is large (e.g. 1000 in Imagenet), because it is hard to estimate the confusion matrix (e.g. 1000 by 1000 matrix on Imagenet) but the confusion matrix estimation is a very crucial step in all OLS algorithms. We will include this limitation discussion in the revision.\n\n**Generalized label shift**: Yes, the definition of online generalized label shift implies it is a combination of domain shift and label shift, while domain shift is specified in this form: the two distributions conditioned on any label class can be aligned by the same mapping function $h$.\n\n**Lightweight SSL methods**: Besides MoCo, we also experimented with other two lightweight SSL methods: entropy minimization and rotation degree prediction. From Figure 2, 6 and 7, we can observe that both entropy minimization and rotation degree prediction provides very consistent improvement and MoCo provides the most significant improvement overall among all three SSL methods."
