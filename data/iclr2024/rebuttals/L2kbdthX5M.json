                    "value": "This paper looks at the problems of Sign Language (SL) production and translation. They introduce a significant new dataset of annotated sign language data. While many of the videos used are curated from other datasets (e.g., How2Sign), a core contribution is their optimized 3D body (SMPL-X) and hand (MANO) representations for each frame in these datasets. Sign Language transcription forms can vary (e.g., text/gloss/HamNoSys), so one benefit of this work is the inclusion of multiple forms and across languages (English, German SL, French SL, Polish SL, Greek SL). The authors also introduce benchmarks and metrics to facilitate future modeling work. \n\nOn top of this, the authors describe development of an SL production baseline based on VQ-VAE models which shows promise. The videos are compelling and the results are significantly better than Ham2Pose on various metrics."

For example, adding biomechanics constraints on top of the SMPL and MANO computations. \n* The use of multiple SL annotation types (HymNoSys, text, gloss) makes this work useful for working on SL modeling from multiple perspectives. \n* The SL production work is a really nice advanced development of discrete variable model approaches for complex motion synthesis. \n* Related work is well represented and contextualized (although some additional work from the HCI and Accessibility communities could be added)\n* The paper is well written and generally easy to follow (but may be hard to reproduce given the complexities of each model involved)."

We appreciate that they recognize the impact and significance of the SMPL-X and MANO annotations in our dataset as well as its multi-prompt and cross-language nature. We are delighted that the reviewer finds our system design novel and paper exceptional. We confirm that the reviewer has a good grasp of the contributions of our paper.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that some of the de-facto metrics used ubiquitously do not reflect the performance very well for the task at hand. $\\textbf{FID}$ could be one of them. However, rather than omitting these metrics, we find it important to have them available as they are used across a wide range of works and make cross-checking easier. Nonetheless, we only employ FID to evaluate the first stage of VQVAE training. For this part, FID provides hints on whether our VQVAE is generating reasonable and plausible motions with a similar distribution to our ground-truth annotation. \n\nNew videos in $\\textbf{our project webpage (see general remarks)}$, correlate well with our low-FID scores and demonstrte the realism and stability of our motion generation. Following reviewer's suggestion, in the project webpage we included character-driven animation to produce more visible motion patterns. In addition, we have $\\textbf{enriched our Appendix}$ with Figures $\\textcolor{red}{10-13}$, where the benefits are qualitatively shown.\n\nEvaluating the impact of biomechanical constraints is indeed a good idea. To this end, we have included a version of our method ablating the biomechanical constratints in Table $\\textcolor{red}{6}$ of our $\\textbf{revised Appendix}$. This table can also be found in response to Reviewer qy3Y. Furthermore, Figure $\\textcolor{red}{12}$ qualitatively depicts the the impact of these constraints, where the reconstructed poses are essentially more realistic and plausible."

This approach is evaluated on the presented benchmark, and the presented qualitative results look promising."

Failure analysis and having SLP with different prompts that are corresponding to the same meaning would have strengthened the submission. \n\n- Overall the presentation quality of the paper can improve significantly. As is it does not meet the expectation of being publication ready (See Questions). \n\nAbout Dataset:\n- This manuscript is framed as a dataset paper, however there is no new data that is collected or will be released. What the paper actually presents is derivative data, i.e. 3D pose estimates from existing datasets, which is disappointing as a reader who was hoping to find a new,  potentially useful data source. \n\n- Although the authors present this dataset as \"large scale\", it still lacks the scale to be considered as one. 70,000 videos is hardly large scale, even considering the contemporary SL alternatives, such as BOBSL or Youtube-ASL. \n\nAbout Pose Estimation Framework:\n- Given one of the main proposed contributions of this paper is the pose estimation framework, I would have expected more qualitative and quantitative results against the state-of-the-art approaches from the model based pose estimation domain. If this is just an application of previously existing approaches, such as (Spurr et al., 2020), then this needs to be clearly stated. \n\nAbout VQ-VAE SLP-based Approach:\n- The proposed VQ-VAE based SLP approach is only evaluated on the presented benchmark dataset, which does not give the reader any anchor points to compare against the state-of-the-art on other benchmarks. Also the authors compare their approach only against the Ham2Pose-3D approach on the new benchmark."

What is \"word\", which is the \"ASL\" dataset? It would have been better to have a clear introduction of the terminology and the source dataset that are utilized just after or before Figure 2. \n\n- \"Moreover, there are over 300 different sign languages across the world, with hearing-impaired people who do not know any SL.\" Can the authors elaborate what they mean here?\n\n- \"Our SL annotations can be categorized into four common types: HamNoSys, spoken language, word, and gloss, which can be used for a variety of downstream applications such as SLP and SLR\".

We appreciate that the reviewer acknowledges the usefulness of our method and finds our SLP performance to be compelling, and multi-source prompting to be interesting especially when combined with 3D mesh generation.\n\nImportantly, we appreciate their warning on the use of terminology. We have now updated the manuscript to use either $\\textbf{``Deaf\" or `Hard of Hearing' everywhere}$. \n\n$\\textbf{General.}$ We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Our new supplementary video on our project page (see general comments) now contains narration. Rapid motions are still difficult for us to handle. Handling ambiguities in the SL videos is in fact an important future work.\n\n$\\textbf{About Dataset.}$ We kindly disagree with the reviewer. There are several components to a dataset, two of which are the input and the labels or annotations. While we source our videos from various online repositories, we do compute our annotations (crucial for supervised learning) which indicates a new dataset. We will in fact be releasing these annotations upon publication. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that \"large scale\" is an ambiguous term used in reference to varying sizes for varying problems. Note that, we are a \"3D motion\" dataset and not a 2D video dataset. \nFor example, a subset of our data, How2Sign, is already claimed to be large-scale for this setting. Nevertheless, our dataset is the largest as far as 3D meshes, SMPL-X and MANO annotations are concerned, making it a significant contribution in this field as confirmed by Reviewer MwWu. \n\n$\\textbf{About Pose Estimation Framework.}$ We thank the reviewer for bringing this up. Note that our annotation pipeline (pose estimation or reconstruction algorithm) with its temporal-consistency, biomechanical constraints and hierarchical initialization is novel. To demonstrate its advantage, we have now included more qualitative and quantitative results, both regarding our dataset and EHF dataset [1]. Specifically, $\\textbf{Appendix B.1}$ provides new evaluations of our reconstruction in comparison to the state-of-the-art. In the existing benchmark of EHF, our annotation method shows a clear advantage (see Table 6, which we also include in response to Reviewer qy3Y). We further illustrate this qualitatively in Figure $\\textcolor{red}{10}$. \n\n[1] Pavlakos, Georgios, et al. \"Expressive body capture: 3d hands, face, and body from a single image.\" CVPR 2019."

Structure of autoregressive Transformer and code-index vector.}$\nCode index vector is the (discrete) latent feature of the motion. Let us consider Motion VAE in Figure 4. Any SL motions can be encoded into a continuous latent space, which can be discretized into a sequence of codebook indices via quantization using a learnable codebook. This is denoted as $X = [x_{1}, ..., x_{T/w}, x_{\\mathrm{EOS}}]$, where $\\mathrm{EOS}$ (end of sequence) is an extra learnable end token representing the stop signal. By projecting $X$ back to their corresponding codebook entries, we can obtain the $\\textit{code index vectors}$ as the latent feature $F^m_{1:(T/w)}=(f_{1}^{m}, \\dots , f_{1:(T/w)}^{m})$ and $f_{i}^{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{z}}$.\n\nAutoregressive Transformer serves as an autoregressive code index generator and the objective for training the code index generator can be seen as an autoregressive next-index prediction task. The process can be formulated as follows: given the previous $i-1$ indices and the conditioning code $c$ embedded by fusing the linguistic feature $E^{l}$ and the codebook index vectors, the Transformer predicts the distribution of possible next indices $p(X_{i},c\\mid X_{<i})$ as shown in Figure 4.\n\n$\\textbf{References}$\n\n[1] Pavlakos, Georgios, et al. \"Expressive body capture: 3d hands, face, and body from a single image.\" CVPR 2019.\n\n[2] Lin, Jing, et al. \"One-Stage 3D Whole-Body Mesh Recovery with Component Aware Transformer.\" CVPR 2023.\n\n[3] Zhang, Hongwen, et al. \"Pymaf-x: Towards well-aligned full-body model regression from monocular images.\" TPAMI 2023.\n\n[4] Feng, Yao, et al. \"Collaborative regression of expressive bodies using moderation.\" 3DV 2021.\n\n[5] Rong, Yu, Takaaki Shiratori, and Hanbyul Joo. \"Frankmocap: A monocular 3d whole-body pose estimation system via regression and integration.\" ICCV 2021.\n\n[6] Moon, Gyeongsik, Hongsuk Choi, and Kyoung Mu Lee. \"Accurate 3D hand pose estimation for whole-body 3D human mesh estimation.\" CVPRW 2022.\n\n[7] Lin, Jing, et al. \"Motion-x: A large-scale 3d expressive whole-body human motion dataset.\" NeurIPS 2023."

Word-level and sentence-level videos should be divided, as they have different co-articulated characteristic.\n- For the proposed baseline method, how does the semantics input act as a condition in the autoregressive Transformer?\n- What is PLFG? I cannot find this module in Figure 4.\n- The core design of the baseline is the utilization of VQ-VAE for both motion and semantics tokenization. Could the authors perform ablation on it?\n- Some typos, divrse in Page 4; the ASL data volume is not consistent in Table 2 and the text description (34K, 35K).\n- Some other relevant works should be discussed in the part of 3D holistic mesh reconstruction (for SL), such as \nHu H, Zhao W, Zhou W, et al.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their constructive feedback and appreciate that the reviewer acknowledges the impact of our SL motion dataset on sign language production as well as the soundness of our baseline and the quality of our manuscript. We have incorporated the minor corrections and additional citations. We address the rest of the concerns below.\n\n- $\\textbf{Evaluation metrics.}$ We absolutely agree with the reviewer that, due to the novelty of the task and our benchmark, evaluation needs to be rethought. Unfortunately, we are not aware of a direct 3D back-translation model for motion SLP, which we plan to investigate in a future study. In this work, instead of re-inventing the wheel, we indeed contribute to the available repertoire of metrics. In particular, inspired by the studies in human-motion-generation, we introduce MR-precision, which evaluates how much $\\textit{generated motion}$ resembles the $\\textit{ground truth motion}$. As we describe in our Appendix C1, it measures the average accuracy at top-$k$ positions of sorted Euclidean distance between a motion feature generated from a sequence joint-rotations and 16 motion samples from dataset. We argue that, as opposed to mean 3D joint position error, this metric is especially suited to the 3D  motion SLP task since: (i) the orientation of hand joints carries particular semantic meaning, (ii) such comparison in the latent space parallels a $\\textit{semantic evaluation}$ of signs, without having the need for an explicit continuous-mesh to sign classifier. In the future, we will work on designing more explicit, physical evaluation-models. We have now updated the paper for further clarity.\n\n- $\\textbf{Baseline semantics input.}$ $\\textbf{In our SignVAE}$, the semantics input to our method is the linguistic feature $E^{l}$. As in Figure 4, our conditioning code $c$ is formed by concatenating this semantics input and the codebook index vectors of $Z^{l}$, whose dimension is reduced into the transformer dimension by a linear projection. We subsequently concatenated this feature with the current $\\textit{code index vector}$ for a positional embedding. $\\textbf{In our baseline in Table 5}$, SignVAE (Base), we remove the PLFG, and replace the conditioning code $c$ with a canonical CLIP-style encoder feature with 512 dimensions. \n\n- $\\textbf{PLFG}$ is our parallel linguistic feature generator, which is the VQVAE based structure illustrated at the top of Figure 4. It is a linguistic feature generator jointly optimized with our SL motion generator (bottom of Figure 4) in a parallel manner. We have polished the description of this part in our revised version.\n\n- $\\textbf{Ablation on VQVAE.}$ We agree with the reviewer that ablations on our VQVAE are important. This is the reason why Table 5 of our main paper ablates on the essential components of our VQVAE, namely the parallel linguistic feature generator (PLFG) and the quantized semantic representation.\n\n- $\\textbf{Comparison to SignBERT+ on reconstruction.}$ We have properly cited and discussed SignBERT+ in our revised paper."
