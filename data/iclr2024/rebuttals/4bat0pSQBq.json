                    "value": "This paper discusses a Graph Neural Network based model to simulate the progress of a flood over a heterogenous region due to a rainfall event. The Digital Elevation Map (DEM) of the region is provided as an input. The model is based on the laws analogous to conservation of mass and momentum to govern the flow of water from one region to another, depending on the height and amount of water already accumulated. It is shown that this model can simulate the spreading of flood more accurately than other ML-based models, especially in the early stages of the flood."

The difference between CommGNN- and CommGNN is in the water retention capacity. Does it then indicate that it is this aspect, and not the model itself, which has most impact?

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We were able to address each one of them and hope that the reviewer would consider upgrading the rating based on our responses\n\n1) **The GNN-based model, including the message-passing mechanism, is not described very thoroughly.**  \nWe have rewritten the Method section providing a detailed description of our architecture.\n\n2) **Does it then indicate that it is this aspect, and not the model itself, which has most impact? If that is the case, then shouldn't we be trying to incorporate the water retention aspect in the existing architectures rather than proposing a new architecture?**  \nThe design of the message passing plays a key role in the dispersion phase. The GCN and GAT models considered in our work are implemented the same way as CommGNN with the retention component but with the message-passing of the vanilla GCN and GAT,  respectively. We show that they do not perform as good as CommGNN because their message-passing is not as expressive as the one we propose following the conservation of momentum and mass\n\n3) **We have no results on how the proposed approach compares with the hydrological/hydrodynamic models used by domain scientists for flood simulation**  \nThe training data is generated using the hydrodynamical model LISFLOOD-FP which we use as the ground truth. There is not enough spatio-temporal data readily available to train an ML model. Therefore, ML models are trained on the simulation output of hydrodynamic models so that they can match their accuracy.\n\n4)**Fig 1 shows how water from two adjoining nodes at higher elevation can flow into one node at lower elevation. But how can water from a higher region divide itself into two lower locations?**  \nWe apply the D8 flow direction graph, which is represented by linking each node to its steepest neighbor. Thus, for each node, there is only one outgoing edge (Page 4 & Appendix A.3). The D8 flow direction has long been used by domain experts in hydrology especially when dealing with very shallow water. However, we recognize that this becomes a limitation for later stages (which is shown in our experiments in Table 2). In future work, we will investigate a better graph representation such as a dynamic graph which will be determined based on the current surface elevation and potential energy surface\n\n5) **Is elevation the only factor that influences the dispersion of water? What can be other factors and can they be taken into account in the proposed model?**\nSoil infiltration and friction can be other factors that can be taken into account. However, these data are not readily available, especially solid infiltration extraction which is an active area of research. The incorporation of these features will result in a more involved shallow water equations and therefore will require some modification to the message passing proposed in our current work.\n\n6) **Do the competing models take DEM or any other auxilliary information as input?**\nWe use the same input, that is, DEM and precipitation, for all the models for a fair comparison.\n\n7) **Is it possible to have an experimental result that shows the water retention and dispersion stages separately?**  \nCommGNN$^-$ considers only the water dispersion. MLP, used as one of the baselines,  does not have propagation. It can be considered as a retention-only method\n\n8) **Can the retention abilities be different in different regions? Which factor in the model takes the retention capacity into account?**  \nYes, water retention can be different over a region because the precipitation data is spatially distributed, resulting in different amounts of rainwater falling in different places of a region. Other local attributes could also be incorporated as inputs in the retention phase.\n\n9) **In the experiment, has it been assumed that each region is of uniform elevation? What is the spatial resolution of the DEM, rainfall and flood water depth map?**  \nNo, they are not uniform. We are using real-world data representing watersheds with various topographies. Details about the regions are shown in Appendix A.4, Table 5, and Figure 6. The resolution of each DEM grid cell is 30m by 30m, and so are the rainfall and water depth maps."

To facilitate modeling, the region is discretized into sub-regions, each \nrepresented as a graph node. The GNN comprises multiple sequential message-passing (MP) layers \ndesigned to process and propagate local information, drawing inspiration from the physical \nprinciples of mass and momentum transport as described by the shallow water equations (SWE). In \naddition to this, two other physical inductive biases are considered: (i) the orientation of graph \nedges between nodes follows the steepest descent direction, with only one outgoing edge per \nnode/sub-region, and (ii) a retention layer is applied before each MP layer to account for water \naccumulation at each sub-region due to local precipitation. The model produces temporal rollouts by \nrecursive evaluation.\n\nThis model was trained and tested using empirical precipitation data and corresponding simulated \nflooding data. The performance of the model was compared against that of an MLP, a U-Net, two \npopular GNNs, and a baseline GNN previously proposed for flood modeling. The proposed model \noutperforms the baselines, particularly in early-stage flood simulations."

It seems not to be the goal to improve the accuracy, since the model is trained with simulated \nflooding data. Is it accelerating the simulation? Runtime comparisons with numerical solvers are \nnot included in the paper.\n\n2. Solely from a deep-learning viewpoint, the contributions are not significant. Another \"species\" \nof message passing is added to an already vast range of options.\n\n3. The term \"physics-informed\" used in the title is not well chosen in my opinion. This may lead to confusion \nwith Physics-Inspired Neural Networks (PINNs), where the governing equations are included \nin the loss function. Instead, something along the lines of \"physical inductive-bias\" would be more suitable.\n\n4. The use of a single out-going edge per node assumes that the information is only propagated \ndownhill. This may not be true for later-stage flood simulations. The authors should verify \nand indicate if this inductive bias is actually helpful for test case here considered. Its possible \ndrawbacks should be discussed. It seems like a clear limitation for other settings without such\na strongly biased transport.\n\n5. The authors mention the previous work of Bentivoglio et al. (2023) and Kazadi et al. (2022), \nhowever, other similar research is missing. E.g.,\n* Oliveira Santos V, Costa Rocha PA, Scott J, Th JVG, Gharabaghi B. A New Graph-Based \nDeep Learning Model to Predict Flooding with Validation on a Case Study on the Humber \nRiver. Water. 2023; 15(10):1827. https://doi.org/10.3390/w15101827\n* Farahmand, H., Xu, Y. & Mostafavi, A.

Sci Rep 13, 6768 \n(2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32548-x\nIn these two articles, the flooding models account for past states as opposed to the model \nproposed here. The authors should discuss if that is needed or not. It may happen that only \nthe current state is relevant for inferring the water depth at the next time-point due to the \ndeterministic nature of the problem.\n\n6. Whilst the model is compared to other GNNs and the GNN proposed by Bentivoglio et al. \n(2023), it is not compared against the Interaction Networks (Battaglia et al. 2016), which were \nshown to very suitable for Lagragian and Eurlarian simulations of fluids (Pfaff et al. 2021, \nSanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020)."

The loss term in equation (8) penalizes the prediction of negative water depths, however, is \nnot better to enforce the satisfaction of this condition by the use of ReLU activation after the \nlast layer?\n\n2. What is the number of parameters of each model? This is a crucial factor that usually directly determines the performance.\n\nAnd 2 minor points:\n\n3. Wrong formula for the Pearson correlation coefficient, it seems to repeat NSE?\n\n4. Other research has considered back-propagating through multiple evaluations of the model. Could this be beneficial for the flood forecasting and long-term stability?\n\n________\n\nPost-rebuttal:\n\nI'd like to thank the reviewers for the detailed update.  It is good to see that it outperforms a series of popular MP algorithms in early flooding stages. It would be important, however, to make sure all models have the same number of parameter. It seems the current comparison uses significantly different sizes.\n\nSo overall, I think the submission is improving, but I believe there are still quite a few open questions: beyond a thorough baseline comparison, the runtime would be interesting, and potentially a more detailed derivation of the method or a demonstration of broader applicability. As such I will keep my score, I'm still leaning towards the rejection side."

(ii) The design of a message passing that follows the conservation of mass and momentum \n(iii) Applications on real-world regions, which have complex topologies compared to nicely shaped manifolds considered in current ML for dynamic systems.\nThrough extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method is better than the existing alternatives. We have written the Related Work and Methods sections present our work more clearly.\n\n3) **The term \"physics-informed\" used in the title is not well chosen in my opinion**  \nThank you for the suggestion. We will change the title  to \u201cFlood Simulation With Physics-guided Message Passing\" when the openreview system allows it. \n\n4) **The use of a single out-going edge per node assumes that the information is only propagated downhill. This may not be true for later-stage flood simulations**  \nWe agree with the reviewers. This is the main point we showed in Table 2 and pointed out this limitation to address in future work. In future work, we will investigate a better graph representation such as a dynamic graph which will be determined based on the current surface elevation and potential energy surface. That said, a single out-going edge per node seems to work well at the early stages of simulations, and it has long been used by domain experts in hydrology when the water depth is not very high. We show these results comparing the performance between the single edge out-going edge graph and when the entire grid is used as a graph in Table 4 (Appendix A.3).\n\n5) **In these two articles, the flooding models account for past states as opposed to the model proposed here. The authors should discuss if that is needed or not**  \nThank you for suggesting these works. In our case, based on the design of the model we tried to use past history of precipitation data in our model but we did not notice any performance improvement. However, we cannot give a definitive answer to whether the past history is relevant or not, since we might need to investigate a little bit further to figure out what feature might be suitable with past history.\n\n6) **More baselines** \nWe have compared our method to MeshGraphNet from the same authors of (Battaglia et al. 2016), (Pfaff et al. 2021), and (Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. 2020). We have added two more baselines MP-PDE, and ConvLSTM (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2015/file/07563a3fe3bbe7e3ba84431ad9d055af-Paper.pdf) \nThe original versions of these baselines did not perform well. When fine-tuning them and trying out different activation functions and data normalization techniques, we found that log-transformation of the data and tanh activations boosted the performance of these methods. We therefore applied the same transformation to all other methods (including ours) for fair comparison and noticed an improvement, the results of the current version of the paper are much better than the previous ones for all the methods. Our proposed method still performs the best compared to these additional baselines\n\n7) **Use ReLU activation after the last layer?**  \nThis was our initial implementation, but we found that this was a little bit difficult to train, probably due to zero gradients, the \u201cdying ReLU\u201d phenomenon.\n\n8) **What is the number of parameters of each model?**   \n We have added the parameters of each model in Table 7 Appendix (A.5)\n\n9) **Other research has considered back-propagating through multiple evaluations of the model. Could this be beneficial for the flood forecasting and long-term stability?**  \nWe are not sure we understand. However, this looks like an interesting idea. We would be grateful if the reviewer could share some references."

Currently these DL models are inaccurate at modeling the early stages of flooding events and do not incorporate physical knowledge from numerical methods. The authors propose using a physics-inspired GNN to predict water depths autoregressively. Their method, ComGNN, similar to MeshGraphNet's message-passing framework is inspired by the conservation of mass and momentum in the shallow-water equations (simplification of Navier-Stokes). The proposed method is tested on real-world data covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation events and the results show that the model outperforms the baslines and is better at early stage flooding detection."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the comments. We were able to address each one of them and hope that the reviewer would consider upgrading the rating based on our responses. \n\n1) **For methods such as Forward Euler to converge there is a CFL condition which bounds \u2206t by \u2206x and 1 is too large.**  \nWe agree with the reviewer. This was not clear  in the paper. Data is generated from numerical hydrodynamic model LISFLOOD-FP,  an optimized and specialized model developed by domain experts. At fixed intervals, it outputs snapshots of water depths. However, internally it uses an adaptive time-stepping to ensure convergence. $\\Delta t$ here refers to the output time (which remains the same for the entire dataset), not the internal time step used by LISFLOOD-FP.  We set $\\Delta t$=1 in the current version of our work as it doesn't change\n\n2) **Forward Euler not numerically stable, advanced schemes such as RK4 may perform better**.\nWe mentioned Foward Euler to show how  $\\frac{q^t-q^{t-1}}{\\Delta t}$ comes from $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}$ in Eq 8.This is only used  for our model, true data is generated by LISFLOOD-FP with an adaptive time-stepping.\n\n3) **Numerical solutions as additional baseline**\nGiven the complexity and size of the domain, the shallow water equations for flood simulation are solved numerically with optimized numerical hydrodynamic solvers (e.g, LISFLOOD-FP)  developed by domain experts. Raw numerical solvers such as FD, FEM can break in some scenarios due to the ground topography inequalities and external boundary conditions such as precipitations.\n\n4) **Highly related to MeshGraphNets**\nOur method is different from MeshGraphNet  (i) We are dealing with system of PDEs, in MeshGraph only 1 PDE equation is used at a time (ii) Our method has 2 stages: water retention, and water dispersion. This paradigm turns out to be useful for capturing external input such as precipitation.  MeshGraphNet does not model such phenomena (iii) We have 2 message-passings that approximate spatial derivative in Eq1&Eq2 with Eq9&Eq8, respectively (iv) The design of these message-passings captures the topography of the domain and the amount of water based on conservation of mass and momentum. MeshagraphNet simply concatenates all the features.(v) We are working on domains with very complex topographies where the continuity of the water elevation can break. MeshGraphNet has been applied only on smooth manifolds.  \nWe compared our method to MeshGraphNet with same features as our method and showed that our approach achieves  better results.\n\n5) **Loss function hard-coded**\nThe loss function is for training purposes only, with no theoretical derivation. We found that most methods benefited from this loss, especially MeshGraphNet, with an increase of up to 20% in performance. Whereas $L_2$ and $L_1$ would require fine-tuning the learning and decay function for each individual model, which could still perform worse than this loss function. \n\n6) **Generalization**\nWhile we are looking at extending our work to other physical processes, the current version of this work is specific to shallow-water equations in the context of flood simulation. We have improved the motivation of our work in the introduction.\n\n7) **No theoretical or convergence properties**\n We have rewritten the method section by providing a justification for the design proposed.\n\n8) **More baselines**\nWe have added MeshgGraphNet, MP-PDE, and ConvLSTM (Shi 2015)  as baselines. However, we had trouble fine-tuning DINO, PINNs, and FourierNet on our dataset because of memory constraints. \nThe original versions of MeshGraphNets and MP-PDEs did not perform well. When fine-tuning them and trying out different activation functions and data normalization techniques, we found that log-transformation of the data and tanh activations boosted the performance of these methods. We therefore applied the same transformation to all other methods (including ours) for fair comparison and noticed an improvement, the results of the current version of the paper are much better. Our proposed method still performs the best compared to these additional baselines.\n\n9) **Reason why GNNs not been explored for flood simulations?.**\nFlood simulation poses the following challenges (i) The complexity of the ground topography, which can break the continuity of flows. Even though methods such as MeshGraphNets and DINO have simulated the Navier-Stokes, their experiments are mainly conducted on simpler and smoother manifolds which ensure the continuity of the physical process. (ii) The sparsity of the data: The data is usually very sparse, which makes it difficult to train. (iii) Swift transition of states from dry to wet or wet to dry. Assuming a discretized domain, it is easy to predict water increment on a cell that has already water in it. This explains the good performance of all the methods in Table 2. However, predicting the transition from a dry cell to a wet cell is usually harder (see Table 1)."

The model innovatively incorporates physical laws, specifically the conservation of momentum and mass from the shallow-water equations, into its framework. It operates on real-world, spatially distributed rainfall data to predict water depth over time, addressing the shortcomings of traditional hydrodynamic models and previous ML-based methods. ComGNN stands out for its two-stage approach, which first accounts for water retention at the rainfall site and then simulates the water's propagation throughout the region. The model demonstrates superior performance over existing methods, particularly in early flood stages, which is critical for timely flood risk mitigation. It's trained on real-world data from nine regions and seven historical precipitation events, showing promising results, especially in reducing root mean square error (RMSE) when predicting water depths."

We were able to address each one of them and hope that the reviewer would consider upgrading the rating based on our responses. \n\n1) **Novelty of the ComGNN model**.  \nWe have expanded the method section by providing a detailed description of the model. In the revised version of the manuscript,  we show that our method operates in two stages. Each cell first retains water from the rain and then propagates it following Eq1 & Eq2  Propagation starts with the conservation of momentum (Eq2) where we use a message passing based on the topology of the ground elevation and the amount of retained water (of each cell/node) as an approximation of the spatial derivative to obtain Eq8. This produces a flow that is used in the conservation of mass (Eq1) approximated by Eq10 to output the final water depth. \nTherefore, the novelty of our method includes (i) a two-stage paradigm in the spatiotemporal simulation of flooding when accounting for precipitation data, which as external sources are rarely considered in current ML simulations of dynamic systems. (ii) The design of a message passing that follows the conservation of mass and momentum \n(iii) Applications on real-world regions, which have complex topologies compared to simpler manifolds considered in current ML for dynamic systems\n\n2) **Eq 1 to 4 appears to describe the application of learnable multilayer**  \nWe have expanded the method section by showing that Eq 8 & 10 (in the current version) are the building blocks of a message passing architecture inspired by the conservation of mass and momentum.\n\n3) **Figures in page 8 and 9 could move them in to appendix**  \nThank you for the suggestion, we have moved most figures to the appendix and have expanded the method section.\n\n4) **The current formulation of the problem may be overly simplistic for readers not well-versed in the field. It would be advisable to include the mathematical model within this section to enhance comprehension**  \nThank you for the suggestion. We have included a description of the physics behind a flooding process in section 3 as follows. \"The theoretical framework for flood modeling is based on fluid mechanics described by the 3D Navier-Stokes equation. In practice, however, the characteristic vertical length scale of the flow is very small with respect to the characteristic horizontal length scale, resulting in a constant horizontal velocity field throughout the depth of the fluid. The dynamics of a flooding process are, therefore, derived by depth integrating the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, leading to a system of non-linear PDEs called shallow-water equations...\""
