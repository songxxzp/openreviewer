This is a novel problem formulation according to the authors. But since I am not well-versed in this line of work, I am not confident about the authors's claim on the originality. I encourage other reviewers comment on this point. The paper reframes text classification tasks into a binary classification task, adaptable to any number of labels and occurrences. I think it is a neat approach that unifies various text classification tasks into a single framework. It is something I have not read about before, but again I am not an expert in this area, so please refer to other reviewers' comments on this point. \n\nQuality: The paper provides a thorough evaluation of X-SHOT on three benchmark datasets across diverse domains in both single-label and multi-label classifications. The evaluation demonstrates that X-SHOT outperforms preceding state-of-the-art techniques in FewRel and UFET.\n\nClarity: The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear section headings and subheadings. The paper provides detailed explanations of technical terms and concepts, making it accessible to readers with varying levels of expertise.\n\nSignificance: The paper's contributions seems to have significant implications for the field of text classification, as X-SHOT provides a unified system that can handle any label occurrence, making it a versatile solution for real-world applications."

                    "value": "* May be over claiming contributions: I have to admit that I have not read a lot of papers in few-shot/zero-shot/one-shot domain. It seems quite unexpected to me that no one had ever attempted to develop a system that can utilize labels of all frequencies. After reading this paper, I did some simple google search. Without going into too much details, I found some articles discussing models that can handle \"N-shot\" labels with N ranging from 0 to some N, albeit N is not claimed to be set to infinity, which seems to be very similar to the \"X-shot\" problem formation. Since I am no expert in this topic and I certainly do not intend to become on for the purpose of this review, I encourage other reviewers who have more domain knowledge than me to think about this point.\n* The fact that the proposed model does not do well on the Situation dataset can be problematic: From table 2 we can see that the proposed model does not do well on the Situation dataset and it certainly did not \"still exceed[s] all other baselines significantly.\" In particular, I find it hard to be persuaded that the proposed model exceeds NLI (Li et al., 2022) **significantly**. Can authors elaborate on this?\n* Other aspect might worth considerations yet unexplored: For example, for the Situation dataset, GPT3.5 is able to outperform all other models. However, the authors could have argue that GPT3.5 might be less advantageous because of computational efficiency. The paper does not provide a detailed comparison of X-SHOT with other state-of-the-art techniques in terms of computational efficiency. It is unclear how X-SHOT compares in terms of training time and computational resources required."

In order to prove the practical value of the proposed X-shot that the zero-shot, few-shot, and frequent-shot problems can be well-solved by the unified training, I think the final results should be compared with the additional results retrieved by disjoint training.
