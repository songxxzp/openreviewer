We appreciate your recognition of our approach to ground LLM-based planning in real environments using video demonstrations and CLIP-based reward. Your understanding of the significance of our method in enhancing the detail and contextual relevance of sub-instructions is encouraging.\n\n```\nQ1: I am just curious if the CLIP reward can be leveraged to finetune the low-level policy.\n```\nYes, the potential fine-tuning process could be:\n**Generating Feedback**: After the low-level policy executes an action, the result (captured as an image or video frame) is fed into CLIP along with the textual description of the intended action or task. CLIP then evaluates how well the result aligns with the description.\n**Reward Mechanism**: Based on CLIP's evaluation, a reward signal can be generated. If CLIP finds a high correlation between the action's outcome and the textual task description, a positive reward is given. Conversely, a low correlation results in a lower reward or a penalty.\n**Policy Adjustment**: This reward signal is used to fine-tune the low-level policy's neural network.  RL algorithms such as PPO can be employed here, where the policy network's parameters are adjusted to maximize the received rewards over time.\nIterative Improvement: Over multiple iterations, the low-level policy learns to generate actions that increasingly align with the task descriptions, as validated by CLIP. The policy becomes more adept at interpreting instructions in the context of the visual environment it operates in.\n\nWe believe this integration would be significantly contribute to the field of embodied AI. Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback and the opportunity to consider this exciting direction for our research."

Doesn't the MultiReAct that use a fully trained Cliport policy? if so, the trained policy has already been trained with the gt reward, hence, has been given more information than Cliport (data it had access to during pretraining, as well as additional pretraiend models). If this is the case, then the expectation is that MultiReAct should significantly surpass Cliport. I think a detailed breakdown between the two models are needed to clarify the benefits of MultiReAct.\n\n-   Providing information on the model's architecture with notations on which parts are finetuned and with what data, and which parts are frozen, will add more clarity. At the moment this information is scattered across the paper and hard for the reader to get the bigger picture. To my understanding, the only finetuned part is the VLM, finetuned on the dataset introduced in Section 3.3. \n\n**presentation errors**\n- In Table 1, MultiReAct (Cap) for Tower of Hanoi has SR of 90 but in text in Section 4.2 it has been stated 99.0.\n- The y-axis in Figure 3 is labeled as Performance, without mentioning what that is. SInce two measures of evaluation have been introduced (SR and Cliport reward), I assume that refers to Cliport reward? If so, why in the text in Section 4.3 while referring to Figure 3, numbers for Clip Reward are stated and not Cliport reward?  \n\n\n**validity of empirical results**\nthere seems to be no repetition with various random seeds to measure variation across different runs, also no significance test as well as no use of more recent measures such as IQM[1] were used to validate the reported results are statistically meaningful. Please provide either significant tests or use IGM.\n\n**limitation of empirical evidence**\nThe framework has been presented as a generalist approach to embodied AI. While there are many available benchmarks for Embodied AI such as Habitat, MineDojo, etc, this paper can be strengthened by extending empirical evidence to such environments, or rephrase statements to match the level of generality that the empirical evaluations can support.\n\n[1] Agarwal, Rishabh, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 29304-29320."

The authors evaluate their framework only on the CLIPort tasks, which are relatively simple (e.g., the suction-based gripper abstracts away most of the low-level actions). Tasks involving more low-level controls (e.g., object manipulations) should be evaluated or at least discussed, where whether the CLIP or any existing 2D-based VLM is good enough for providing useful reward signals remains a question. For instance, the CALVIN benchmark. Alternatively, other popular embodied agent planning tasks involving only high-level actions such as ALFRED should be evaluated or at least discussed to give a better sense of the applicability of this framework.\n\n[1] Zero-Shot Reward Specification via Grounded Natural Language"

We understand the importance of distinguishing our work from existing literature and demonstrating its practical applicability in a range of scenarios.\n\n> w1: novelty\n\n**Multimodal Rewards with CLIP Integration**:\n\nWhile integrating multimodal rewards with CLIP might be an existing idea. In our methodology, the Large Language Model (LLM) planner interacts with the CLIP model to dynamically generate both negative and positive conditions. This process is crucial for determining whether a sub-instruction has been successfully executed. Unlike static reward systems, our approach adapts the reward criteria based on the specific context of each task, leading to more nuanced and accurate evaluations.\n\n>w2: suction-based gripper abstracts away most of the low-level actions\n\nClarifying Research Motivation and Focus:\n\n1. Emphasis on Embodied Planning:\nOur primary objective is to enhance embodied planning capabilities within AI systems. This focus is specifically geared towards understanding and improving how AI systems can develop and execute plans based on abstract instructions. Our research is less about physical manipulation and more about the cognitive process of planning in response to given tasks.\n\n2. Scope of Current Experiments:\nThe reason we chose CLIPort tasks for our initial evaluation is that they provide a controlled environment to test our framework's planning capabilities. While these tasks may appear simple due to the abstraction of low-level actions, they are quite effective in demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in generating and executing plans based on multimodal inputs.\n\n3. Future Directions and Broader Applicability:\nWe acknowledge the importance of evaluating our framework in more diverse scenarios, including tasks that involve more intricate object manipulations (as in the CALVIN benchmark) or high-level action planning (such as in ALFRED). While these are valuable areas for future research, they were beyond the initial scope of this study. Our immediate goal was to establish a foundational understanding of how multimodal tools can enhance the planning process in AI systems."

                    "value": "This work proposes the MultiReAct method, which consists of 3 main components: 1. a vision language model for captioning demonstrations in image forms into text forms; 2. A large language model for orchestrating the video captioning model and 3. A CLIP-based discriminator for evaluation of sub-task progress.\n\nConcretely, the VLM is fine-tuned with LoRA on a dataset of demonstrations containing the long-horizon instruction, sub-instructions, and demonstrated image observations.\n\nThe CLIP-based reward function (discriminator) takes in an image observation, a positive proposition, and a negative proposition. It compares the similarity score to determine whether the current observation has completed a particular sub-instruction. Note that here the positive and negative propositions are generated by the LLM.\n\nFinally, the LLM is provided access to trainer VLM and actor modules. It is instructed to parse the visual demonstration into textual sub-instructions and then execute them sequentially. The CLIP-based discriminator provides the signal for the LLM to determine whether the actor has finished the current sub-instruction and can proceed to the next one.\n\nThe authors experimented with CLIPort and Code-as-Policy actors on a suite of short and long-horizon tasks. The results of CLIPort-based methods show that the MultiReAct performs similarly to CLIPort although it doesn't have access to the ground-truth reward signals. Further ablation studies also prove the utility of the CLIP-based reward. Results on Cap-based methods show that MultiReAct combined with Cap enables successful learning of long-horizon tasks."

                        "value": "Thanks for your comments. We address your major concerns one by one.\n> W1: Experiment Fairness\n\nTo ensure the fairness of comparison we make the following setting\n- **CLIPort:** During test time, CLIPort does not directly access video demonstrations. However, it is equipped with an oracle feature that accurately provides it with the necessary sub-instructions at each time step. This setup is intended to simulate a scenario where CLIPort can rely on high-quality, contextual guidance to execute tasks, without the direct need for visual demonstrations.\n- **CaP and ReAct:** Both CaP (Comprehension and Planning) and ReAct (Cap) systems are provided with general instructions on how to fulfill the tasks. These instructions are comparable to what a human operator might receive.  For example, we tell LLMs ``a pyramid is something wide at the bottom and narrow on the top, for a 3 layer pyramid, it should have 3 blocks on the bottom, 2 blocks in the middle and 1 on the top.``  For a detailed view of these instructions, we refer you to Figure 4 in our paper.\n- **MultiReAct**: Unlike CLIPort, which utilizes an oracle feature for sub-instruction guidance, or CaP and ReAct, which access general task instructions, MultiReAct relies exclusively on multimodal reasoning. This approach integrates visual data with abstract robot instructions, enabling the LLMs to infer appropriate actions without the need for explicit oracles or detailed guidelines.\n\n> W2: Is LLMs overkill?\n\nThe LLMs is suitable for the planning tasks. For the following reasons:\n1. **Complex Decision-Making and Integration:**\n    The LLM's role extends far beyond that of a mere sequential call dispatcher. It is integral in orchestrating complex decisions that involve the integration of multimodal inputs and the interpretation of nuanced instructions within varying contexts. This sophisticated level of decision-making and integration, essential for our method, is beyond the capabilities of a simple program.\n2. **Advanced Natural Language Processing:**\n    LLMs excel in understanding and generating human-like text, a key feature that enhances the intuitiveness and effectiveness of interactions, particularly with abstract or complex instructions. Moreover, the plans generated by LLMs are marked by superior interpretability, facilitating clearer communication and execution of tasks.\n3. **Scalability and Versatility:**\n    The LLM-based planning pipeline offers remarkable scalability, adaptable to a wide array of robotics tasks. Unlike fixed programs, LLMs can adjust to new tasks with minimal modifications, demonstrating their versatility and applicability across diverse scenarios.\n4. **Enhancing Reward Model Judgments:**\n     LLMs contribute significantly to setting the judgment criteria for reward models. They generate context-specific positive and negative conditions, guiding the reward models to accurately assess whether a sub-instruction has been successfully fulfilled."

                        "value": "> Q1: How many demonstrations are needed to fine-tune the VLM? How many are used to train CLIPort?\n\t\nBoth our VLM in the MultiReAct system and CLIPort are trained on a dataset comprising 100$T$ demonstrations. $T$ denotes the number of tasks.\n\n\n> Q2: Is the VLM fine-tuned for each individual task or on all tasks? Does it generalize to unseen tasks?\n\nOur VLM is fine-tuned across a broad spectrum of tasks, rather than on individual tasks.\n**Incorporating Randomization:** We introduce randomization in the layout and arrangement within each task type. This strategy is crucial for the VLM to handle variations and complexities within the same task domain, ensuring robustness against overfitting to specific layouts or configurations.\n- **In-Domain Generalization:** While our VLM does not generalize to entirely unseen tasks, it exhibits strong generalization capabilities within the domain of trained tasks. This means that the VLM can effectively deal with variations of the same tasks, such as different layouts and arrangements of objects. The model\u2019s ability to adapt to these variations within its training domain is a significant strength. It can understand and process tasks that are similar in nature to the trained ones but differ in specific details, thereby demonstrating a level of flexibility and adaptability within its operational domain.\n\n> Q3: How are the Stack Block Pyramid and Tower of Hanoi tasks randomized? As far as I can tell, MultiReAct will try to replicate exactly what has been done in the demonstration. If this is the case, would the task fail if the colors and initial ring locations are swapped?\n1. **Stack Block Pyramid:**\n     In the Stack Block Pyramid task, randomization is introduced in terms of the block colors and starting positions. This approach ensures that while the overall task objective remains consistent, the specific scenario in each iteration is unique. MultiReAct is trained to understand the fundamental concept of building a pyramid, irrespective of these variations.\n2. **Tower of Hanoi:**\n\tFor the Tower of Hanoi task, we introduce randomization in the initial placement of the rings and occasionally in the color of the rings. The goal is to ensure that MultiReAct does not merely memorize a specific sequence of moves but understands the underlying logic and strategy required to solve the Tower of Hanoi under varying initial conditions.\n\n> Q4: Why do you use CLIP reward score as performance measure in section 4.3 but not the ground-truth reward?\n\n1. **Ground-Truth Reward Challenges:**\n\tIn the context of our experiments, defining a precise ground-truth reward can be challenging. The tasks we are addressing involve complex interactions within dynamic environments, making the establishment of a fixed, objective ground-truth reward for each possible outcome impractical. The subjective nature of some tasks further complicates this issue.\n 2. **CLIP Reward as a Proxy for Ground-Truth:**\n\tThe CLIP reward score serves as a practical and effective proxy for ground-truth in our experiments. CLIP, trained on a vast range of images and text, is adept at evaluating the alignment between visual outcomes and textual descriptions. This alignment is crucial in tasks where success is defined by how well an action aligns with the given instructions or objectives.\n 3. **Real-World Applicability:**\n\t Using the CLIP reward score aligns with real-world scenarios where ground-truth may not be readily available or easily quantifiable. By leveraging CLIP's capabilities, we simulate a more realistic setting where the system must evaluate its performance based on available visual and textual cues, mirroring practical applications.\n\n If you find that our explanations and clarifications have resolved the issues you raised and have shed more light on the aspects you were unsure about, we kindly request you to consider revising your evaluation of our paper. We believe that our detailed responses might provide a clearer perspective on the value and robustness of our work."
