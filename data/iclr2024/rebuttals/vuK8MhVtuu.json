                    "value": "This paper introduces a new technique for path planning, specifically path generation, on graphs such as road networks. \n\nThe key innovation is a diffusion model over a graph, capable of learning a probability distribution of paths from a set of expert demonstrations. Initially, a diffusion model for vertices is defined using the graph Laplacian, which is then extended to create a diffusion model for paths. Once learned, the model can be used for path generation through conditional sampling given a pair of origin and destination vertices. A significant advantage of this approach is its capacity to learn expert paths without assuming that they minimize linearly accumulative costs, a departure from standard search-based path planning.\n\nThe proposed method is evaluated on real-world road network datasets and is shown to outperform several existing methods."

The ability of the proposed model to generate paths without assuming linearly accumulative costs is intriguing.\n\n**Quality**: The overall quality of the work is high. The proposed method is well-designed and technically sound.\n\n**Clarity**: The paper is well-written, with clear statements of the work's motivation and contribution.\n\n**Significance**: The significance of the proposed method is evaluated on a real road network dataset, a strong point of this work, although I have some concerns about the dataset itself, as shown below."

                    "value": "While the proposed method's ability to bypass the linearly accumulative cost assumption is appealing, it's unclear if the path planning tasks for the collected datasets used in the experiment require such assumptions. In other words, I'm not sure if the dataset is fully suited to demonstrate the proposed method's significance.\n\nIn fact, the performance improvements over Dijkstra search are not very significant in terms of the DTW metric. With only average scores reported, it's unclear whether the proposed method demonstrates overall small improvements or if there are a few samples in the dataset where baselines completely failed to work. Similarly, the performance difference between the proposed method and CSSRNN is relatively small in Table 3. Does this suggest that path planning on the new dataset can be mostly solved by existing approaches that assume linearly accumulative costs?\n\nAnother concern is the computational cost. Classical path planners like Dijkstra are appealing because they can run quickly even on CPUs. In practical situations, people use path planning (e.g., route search on a map app) on mobile devices that don't always have sufficient GPU resources. It's not clear how much computation resources are required by the proposed method and other baselines."

At least the standard deviation or confidence intervals should also be reported in each table, but I wonder if the proposed method's strength could have been demonstrated more systematically using synthetic data that simulate paths that existing methods cannot plan or imitate from demonstrations? Such controlled experiments can be as important as real-world data evaluations.\n- How does the proposed method compare to other baselines in terms of computational costs?"

                        "value": "Thank you for the response! Although some of my initial concerns are resolved, I'm not yet convinced if the current experimental result validates the ability of proposed method to handle non-linearly accumulative costs. \n\nSpecifically, I found that just outperforming Dijkstra is not necessarily mean that the proposed method can plan a path based on non-linearly accumulative costs. Suppose a problem where there are two roads from the start to the goal; one road is longer and safer, and the other is shorter but not safer. Safe drivers may choose the longer-safer roads, which cannot be imitated by Dijkstra search \"if the edge cost is given solely by its length\" (i.e., shorter road will be planned). But if the cost is instead given based on safety metrics, Dijkstra search can find a longer-safer choice as the lowest-cost solution. So the problem here is actually about how the underlying cost function is defined, rather than if the cost had been linearly accumulated in demonstration paths or not. Keeping this in mind, it is not obvious whether the current dataset involves demonstration paths that are really based on non-linearly accumulative costs or paths that are just based on unknown cost functions that are still able to be linearly accumulative. Please correct if I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nI just wonder if it's possible to just remove the claim that the proposed method can account for non-linear accumulative costs. Although it could decrease the significance of the work, but doing so would at least avoid arguing the contributions that are not empirically supported."

They compared against traditional optimization methods as their baselines, including Dijkstra's algorithm, NMLR, Key Segment, and Navigation API from Amap. The result shows that the paths generated by GDP are closer to the ground-truth paths than those baselines."

The original results can now be found in App.F.2.\nPlease refer to Sec 6.2 of the revised manuscript for these updates.\n\nAdditionally, as introduced in Sec. 6.1 of the original manuscript, the Navi baseline uses the planning API from Amap (also known as Gaode Map), one of the largest mobile digital map providers in China, boasting over 100 million daily active users. \nAmap has invested considerable resources in enhancing navigation intelligence by developing a complex framework that integrates both rule-based and data-driven approaches, making it an exceptionally strong baseline for comparison."

We are sorry for the confusion.\nIn fact we can choose any search-based planning algorithm as our fallback strategy (eg. the A* algorithm) to guarantee that our method always hits the goal. \nThis will not significantly impact our performance, as our method maintains a high hit ratio of 98.6\\%, as illustrated in App. F.3 of the original manuscript.\n\nResponse to Q2:\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nWe have added an experiment on execution efficiency in App. F.5 of the revised manuscript. \nDijkstra's algorithm is the fastest due to its simplicity. \nThe execution time of our method is $0.112 \\pm 0.315$ seconds, which is faster than the baseline Navi ($0.339 \\pm 0.133$ seconds). \nGiven that Navi is a real world navigation API developed by AMap (https://lbs.amap.com/), one of the leader location service providers in China, it can support real-world applications, the latency of our method is also acceptable for real-world applications.\nOur experiments were conducted on an Nvidia RTX 3090 with 24 GB of memory, accommodating up to a batch size of $400$. \nAs the batch size increases, the memory cost rises linearly, but the time consumption per OD pair decreases from $0.32$ to $0.12$ seconds. \n\nPlease refer to App. F.5 of the revised manuscript for detailed information.\n\nResponse to Q3:\n\nThanks for your question.\n\nUnconditional path generation is one of the solutions for trajectory data mining [1], serving as a building block for various intelligent transportation applications, such as road network planning, traffic light scheduling, and traffic bottleneck detection [2]. \nRecently, the success of generative models in image and text generation tasks has spurred interest in developing models capable of generating paths or trajectories, making it a compelling research topic [3]. \nResearchers hope that the capabilities of generative models will enhance the mining of implicit patterns from path data, enabling the creation of smarter transportation systems.\n\nHowever, these methods are not suited for high-quality road map generation, primarily because they require the road network (i.e., graph structure) as an input.\n\n[1] Yu Zheng.

ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST), 2014, 5(3): 1-55.\n\n[3] Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-temporal Data: A Survey\n\nResponse to Q4:\n\nThanks for your question.\nThe paper you mentioned is indeed interesting. \n\nThe primary distinction between our method and that work lies in the space where the diffusion process occurs: our method operates in graph space, while the other work functions in high-dimensional Euclidean space. \nAs mentioned in Sec. 1 of our original manuscript, this difference renders the adoption of a Gaussian-based diffusion model formidable and necessitates the development of a new diffusion process. \nTo address this, we drew inspiration from the heat conduction process on graphs and devised a novel diffusion model capable of diffusing distribution across graph space, thereby enabling us to capture the graph structure effectively.\n\nWe have added discussion of this paper into Related work, please refer to Sec. 7 of the revised manuscript."

I found that DiffTraj in NeurIPS'23 tacked a similar problem, but they seem to focus on the continuous space. Therefore, please clarify the difficulty of discrete spaces or the similarity between the two models.

To clarify the difference, your contributions are expected to be clarified and explained well.\n- I cannot completely follow the discussion of introducing U-net for the purpose of $\\mathbf{x}_0$: Could you give some additional explanations? (In experiments, for example, they are static (OD-pairs seem to be known), but some probabilistic characterization as a distribution p(x0) is required for the diffusion process; is this right? In Line 2 of Alg1, $\\mathbf{x}_0$ is sampled from $p(\\mathbf{x}_0)$, but I'm confused that $\\mathbf{x}_0$ is already known?)\n- As the dataset contains multiple OD pairs, I\u2019m curious about the std. of the metrics (DTW, LCS): Does the GDP show good performance for almost all OD pairs?

We are sorry for the confusion.\n\nIn the beginning of Sec. 4 and Sec. 4.1 of the original manuscript, we have highlighted the idea or reasons to follow the heat conduction.\nSpecifically, our goal is to design a diffusion model for categorical values (i.e., vertices) that can effectively capture the graph structure, making it more suitable for graph space tasks such as path planning. \nWhile existing literature has explored diffusion models for categorical values, these studies do not focus on designing a process that captures the graph structure. \nHowever, recent research has highlighted the potential of tailoring diffusion processes to different categorical values. \nFor instance, Austin et al. in their paper stated,\"We argue that for most real-world discrete data, including images and text, it makes sense to add domain-dependent structure to the transition matrices $Q_t$ as a way of controlling the forward corruption process and the learnable reverse denoising process.\"\n\nTo further clarify our motivation, we have made modifications to Sec. 1 in the revised manuscript.\n\nResponse to W2 and Q2:\n\nThanks for your comments and we are sorry for making you confused.\n\nThe primary distinction between these two approaches stems from specific task requirements. \nFor path planning in a road network, the output must be a connected path on the graph. \nThis is because vital metadata such as the number of lanes, traffic lights, traffic signs, and speed limits are typically organized based on road segments rather than longitudinal or latitudinal coordinates [1]. \nAs a result, a path on a graph is more suitable for the post-processing of navigation applications.\nConversely, for certain trajectory analysis applications, the focus is more on understanding the relationships among spatial locations and areas. \nIn these cases, generating coordinates is more practical.\n\nMoreover, since the road network graph also includes longitude and latitude information for vertices, converting connected paths into sequences of points with these coordinates is straightforward. \nHowever, models that generate coordinate sequences face challenges in converting these into paths on a graph. \nThis difficulty arises because the coordinate sequence generation process does not account for structural constraints. \nSuch models may need to use map-matching techniques [2] to align the coordinate sequence with the road network.\n\nThese differences and their implications are further discussed and clarified in Sec. 7 of the revised manuscript.\n\n[1] Zheng Wang, Kun Fu, Jieping Ye.

In Sec. 6.1 of the original manuscript, we explained our experiment detail and put other settings in App. F.1.\nWe are sorry for making you confused.\nDue to the page limit, we have to put some details in the appendix.\nWe have thoroughly revised the paper to ensure that all detailed information provided in the appendix is appropriately referenced in the main content."

I do have some questions:\n\n - In Table 3, the authors present an ablation as \"trivial uniform diffusion\". Do the authors mean the \"generic categorical diffusion\" with Q = $\\alpha_t I + \\beta_t 1 1^T / V$? If this is the case, the authors should make that more clear so that readers may enjoy the significant improvement their work brings. If this is not the case, and the authors mean something else, they should run another ablation using \"generic categorical diffusion\" as a baseline, since that seems like the relevant benchmark to beat.\n - Can the authors elaborate on the beam search aspect, and how often a sampled path is actually invalid (i.e., disconnected, or with loops, etc), and what heuristics are used to fix those sampled paths?\n - Can the authors discuss their Guassian mixture model for path lengths in some more detail? While some metrics are provided in the appendix, it is not clear what information this model takes, if any. It seems to me that path length is highly dependent on origin and destination, so I assume their mixture model takes these as input. Can the authors elaborate exactly what the structure of this model is?\n - What is the scaling of the algorithm? Especially compared to Dijkstra? Both in terms of path length, and number of graph vertices.\n - Can the authors elaborate on how they generalize to paths without learning a joint distribution across time? Sampling nodes independently certainly would not yield a sensible path. I could imagine this would work if the reverse process was conditionally independent (i.e. $x^i_{t-1} | x_t$, the latter $x_t$ being _all_ nodes instead of $x_t^i$), but eqn 9 does not actually seem to suggest that. The text touches on this (end of paragraph 3 in 4.3, \"masking $\\hat{x_0}$\"), but to me this statement is quite uninformative, and seems like a very essential point of the paper.\n - Does it generalize to different graphs? i.e. do you need to retrain for each city?\n\nMinor points:\nThe text is generally well written, but it seems like a few paragraphs were missed during the proof reading stage.\nA non-exhaustive list:\n - first paragraph of 4.2 \n - first paragraph of sec 5\n - App. D\n - 6.2 paragraph 2\n - typo in Fig 2. \"Pais\", it is also confusing for 3rd panel to say \"Real\", since the text says these were generated using Navi"

                        "value": "Response to W1 and Q2: \n\nWe apologize for any confusion caused. \nWe have explained how beam search is used to maintain connectivity in App.C.2 of the revised manuscript. \nSpecifically, the beam search is conducted after the reverse process when we have obtained the final estimated distribution $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_0$. \nIdeally, beam search operates in a breadth-first search manner. \nWe start by sampling $n$ vertices from the distribution of $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_0^0$ (with replacement). \nSubsequently, we sample (up to $n$) neighbors of each vertex from the distribution $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_0^1$. \nThis process continues, and we always keep (up to) $n$ sequences with the highest probability in a queue. \nFinally, we sample from these $n$ sequences to get the final path. \nIn practice, however, setting $n$ to 1 suffices for good performance and efficient execution.\n\nWithout beam search, path legality is not guaranteed. \nIf our model fails to generate an ``almost legal'' path without beam search, it suggests that the model does not accurately capture the path pattern. \nTo address this concern, we discuss illegal cases (i.e., disconnections and loops) in App. F.3 of the revised manuscript, alongside the original hit ratio discussion. \nIn summary, our model maintains a low ratio (less than 5%) of illegal vertices in each path, indicating its proficiency in capturing the path pattern.\n\nResponse to W2 and Q3: \n\nWe are sorry for the confusion.\nThe Gaussian mixture model is detailed in the appendix primarily because it is utilized for unconditional path generation. \nIn other words, the Gaussian mixture model takes only the path length as input, without additional information such as origin and destination. \nIn practice, a Gaussian mixture model with four components effectively models the path length distribution.\n\nThe process of unconditional path generation can be summarized as follows:\ni) Sample from the Gaussian mixture model to determine the path length (denoted as $l$);\nii) Generate a random vertex sequence of length $l$;\niii) Perform the reverse process to denoise the random vertex sequence, obtaining the estimated distribution of $\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}_0$; and\niv) Apply beam search to ensure connectivity.\n\nFor conditional path generation, we employ an exponentially increasing window size strategy, negating the need for a Gaussian mixture model for a predefined path length. \nWe adopt this approach instead of directly sampling a long random sequence because we hope a progressive manner will better inform the network $nn_\\theta$ about the path prefix, which results in more effective planning. \nThe detailed process is outlined in Algorithm 3 in App.E. of the original manuscript. \nIt begins with the origin as the initial path sequence, which is then diffused and concatenated with one randomly sampled vertex, yielding a (diffused) path of length two. \nThis path is then denoised through a reverse process. \nNext, the path sequence is diffused again and concatenated with two new randomly sampled vertices, followed by another reverse process. \nThis results in a path of length four. \nThis iterative process continues until the goal is reached or the maximum length limit is hit. \nThe exponential increasing strategy eliminates the need to predefine the path length before planning and enhances efficiency by avoiding a one-by-one diffusion process.\n\nResponse to Q1:\n\nWe are sorry for the confusion.\nYes, the trivial uniform diffusion means ``generic categorical diffusion''. \nWe have modified the description for unification in Sec. 6 of the revised manuscript.\n\nResponse to Q4: \n\nThanks for your comments.\nWe have added an experiment on execution efficiency in App. F.5 of the revised manuscript. \nDijkstra's algorithm is the fastest due to its simplicity. \nThe execution time of our method is $0.112 \\pm 0.315$ seconds, which is faster than the baseline Navi ($0.339 \\pm 0.133$ seconds). \nGiven that Navi is a real world navigation API developed by AMap (https://lbs.amap.com/), one of the leader location service providers in China, it can support real-world applications, the latency of our method is also acceptable for real-world applications.\nOur experiments were conducted on an Nvidia RTX 3090 with 24 GB of memory, accommodating up to a batch size of $400$. \nAs the batch size increases, the memory cost rises linearly, but the time consumption per OD pair decreases from $0.32$ to $0.12$ seconds. \n\nPlease refer to App. F.5 of the revised manuscript for detailed information."

                        "value": "Thank you for addressing my comments and concerns. \n\nThere is one issue that I think might be better addressed in the paper. Although I do not think it is reason to reject the paper, it could be added to the discussion. This issue is that the authors algorithm for determining length is \"greedy\", i.e. it stops when an allowable path has been sampled. While this is allowable, I think that path and path length are highly correlated (i.e. a short path would probably go over highways, while a longer route would probably take more scenic roads). This means that the sampling scheme the authors have devised would preferentially yield short segments, which is in contradiction with the justification the authors provide with in the introduction. \n\nThere is another small concern remaining, which is that my concerns regarding writing clarity have not been addressed in the current manuscript, the following sections should be carefully proofread since there are a lot of grammatical mistakes (missing articles, wrong conjugations, etc). Also not a reason to reject, but I think the authors should address it:\n - first paragraph of 4.2\n - first paragraph of sec 5\n - App. D\n - 6.2 paragraph 2\n\nThat said, I think the things that concerned me most have been addressed, I am in particular happy to have heard the authors clarify that they indeed beat generic categorical diffusion, which I think really demonstrates the value of the paper."
