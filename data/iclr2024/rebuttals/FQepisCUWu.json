The experiments consider two benchmarks: (1) FairEval along with human annotation results from Wu et al. (2023) \u2013 containing 80 open-ended questions with three annotators\u2019 annotations on two model outputs and (2) Topical-Chat along with human annotation results from Mehri & Eskenazi (2020) \u2013 containing 60 dialogue contexts with human annotation on six model outputs. Based on the findings, the authors claim that ChatEval \u201cdelivers superior accuracy and correlation in alignment with human assessment.\u201d In addition, they find that using diverse role prompts (using different personas) helps improve performance."

                    "value": "* Note that I\u2019ve listed both strengths and weaknesses here as they are topically grouped together.\n* The work provides a good list of related work and contextualizes itself in relation to prior/concurrent work. In doing so, however, it is unclear how the main goal of the proposed approach mirrors or differs from prior work (other than the proposed method itself; scoping the contribution/types of tasks more tightly can help here) and what kind of pros and cons or trade-offs there are in comparison to these other works that also leverage multiple LLMs. I\u2019d encourage the authors to provide more information on this aspect both in introduction and related work, as I find the current explanation to be a bit hard to understand in the related work (i.e., \u201cConcurrent with our work, Li et al. (2023b); Zhang et al. (2023) also propose a similar approach. However, they probe different dimensions of improving LLM-based evaluators and do not explore the effectiveness of natural language interaction.\u201d In this sentence, what are \u201cdifferent dimensions\u201d and what does \u201cnatural language interaction\u201d mean here?)\n* I think the idea of exploring diverse role specifications and communication strategies has a lot of potential. However, the current version that\u2019s explored in the paper lacks depth and justification. For instance, there is one line justification for how the diverse role specification was formulated (\u201cWe take inspiration from Wu et al. (2023) and formulate an analogous role description.\u201d), but it is unclear what other alternatives there are, why this is a good baseline to default to, what potential limitations are with this approach. Same thing applies to the design of communication strategies. The authors designed three strategies, but it is unclear how the design decisions were made and what factors are accounted for.\n* Regarding the experiments, I have some concerns about the authors\u2019 main claim. In Table 1, it\u2019s unclear whether the difference between different methods is meaningful since it\u2019s smaller than the difference between human annotators. More discussion on the inter-annotator agreement and how we should interpret the results would be necessary to make the claim about \u201csuperior accuracy and correlation\u201d.  To account for a small number of instances, I\u2019d highly encourage the authors to include standard deviations or errors on all tables and figures. On the other hand, I do appreciate that the authors delve into the importance of diverse role prompts, communication strategies, and the impact of role numbers and discussion turns. However, the qualitative analysis lacks nuance when reporting the finding; I\u2019d be very cautious to call model behaviors \u201chuman-like\u201d and \u201cnot just as a tool [...] but as an embodiment of interactive natural language dialogue\u201d solely based on the four patterns observed in the experiments.\n* Overall, I find the paper to have much room for improvement in terms of writing, need for more justification and explanation for design choices for the proposed method, and need more rigor in analyzing and reporting the experiment results."

                        "value": "We express our genuine gratitude for the questions and concerns you've presented in your review. In response, we begin by re-emphasizing the main goal of our papers, which hold substantial significance. Subsequently, we address your specific concerns, offering explanations that we trust will illuminate the innovative aspects of our research and address the issues you've raised.\n\n**Main goal of our papers:**\nMost of the prior work utilizes a single LLM to score model responses. Recognizing the efficacy of single-LLM evaluations, we pondered how to transition from solitary evaluators to a coordinated system that integrates the decision-making of diverse evaluators, yielding more comprehensive and transparent conclusions. Given that impersonation (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14930) reveals LLMs strengths, we considered the MA approach through impersonative debating. We have also demonstrated that through linguistic communication, LLMs can effectively reach a consensus and provide superior evaluation outcomes. \n\n---\n**Q1: Comparison with contemporary works**\n\nThe contemporary research we referenced share the same aims to enhance the performance of llm-evaluators through multiple llms. However, by \"different dimension,\" we intend to highlight that these works do not investigate the MA debate framework, and they overlook the potentiality and the heuristics of natural language communication\u2014a primary focus of our paper. For instance, while the work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02762) also employs multiple LLMs, their emphasis is on the discussion to takes into account each LLM's pairwise preferences of all answer pairs rather than the intricate components of debate frameworks, such as role design, communication strategy, moreover, their results have shown to be inferior to ours. The work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01862), on the other hand, uses multiple LLMs to collate answers in an ensemble manner, aggregating results without the models engaging in a debate. We appreciate your feedback and will ensure that our distinctions from concurrent work are more explicitly stated in the revised version.\n\n---\n**Q2: The origin of role design and communication strategy**\n\nOur role prompt design originated from existing literature as a foundational reference. We think that taking the existing design from the literature is a good start point for us to study the impersonation. As is shown in table 3, it also shows the effectiveness of the above mentioned role design. Additionally, we have also developed alternative designs and assessed their impact, with details available in section 4.1. We discovered that these specifically crafted role prompts perform better in their respective categories, as is shown in figure 3. Regarding communication strategy, the 'one-by-one' method establishes a common practice for turn-taking debates which is also adopted by previous framework (https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17760). The two additional strategies we introduce are inspired by human interaction patterns and inherently have different functionalities in our framework. For example, 'simultaneous-talk' relaxes the rigid sequence of turns, while 'simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer' addresses the challenge of maintaining a lengthy conversation history. These functionalities are discussed in section 4.2. We are grateful for the reviewer's input and will further clarify these aspects in our forthcoming version.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Whether the difference between different methods is meaningful?**\n\nWe have run the experiments for 5 times and included standard deviations in our results to showcase the consistent stability and statistically significant improvements rendered by our method. This speaks volumes about the robustness of our approach. Additionally, our objective is to demonstrate that our method can consistently outperform another as evidenced by the average and standard deviation. Therefore, if a method consistently yields results closer to the human average, we consider it to be superior. \n\n|                             |                        | Acc.        | Kap          |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n|ChatGPT                      | Single-Agent           | $53.7_{\\pm 1.4}$ | $0.27_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|ChatGPT                      | Multi-Agent (Ensemble) | $55.5_{\\pm 0.7}$ | $0.29_{\\pm 0.01}$ |\n|ChatGPT                     | Multi-Agent (ChatEval) | $60.0_{\\pm 0.9}$ | $0.30_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | Single-Agent           | $60.8_{\\pm 0.7}$ | $0.36_{\\pm 0.01}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | Multi-Agent (Ensemble) | $61.5_{\\pm 0.5}$ | $0.38_{\\pm 0.01}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | Multi-Agent (ChatEval) | $63.8_{\\pm 0.9}$ | $0.40_{\\pm 0.01}$ |"

                        "value": "**Q4: Further clarification of qualitative analysis**\n\nFirst of all, we appreciate the reviewers' recognition of our contributions through quantitative experiments.\nIn terms of qualitative analysis, we would like to clarify that the term \"human-like\" used in our paper refers to the four patterns we've identified, which are heuristically derived from observing human behavior during debates. Noting the similarity in LLM debate processes, we initially labeled these as \"human-like.\" However, considering your feedback, we acknowledge that the term might have been somewhat premature in the context of current AI capabilities. Consequently, we will amend the term to \"human-inspired\" to more accurately convey the essence of our observations.\n\nRegarding the concern about ChatEval as \"not just a tool [...] but as an embodiment of interactive natural language dialogue,\" we want to emphasize that our debate framework transcends being merely an evaluative tool; it is instrumental in increasing the transparency and interpretability of AI systems. OpenAI has indeed articulated in their blog https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research that debate is a technique intended to refine alignment research, aiding humans in evaluating complex tasks beyond direct human assessment. While their own work https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00899 on debate has not extensively covered experiments in natural language and remains preliminary, our framework's utilization of natural language initiates a crucial dialogue on the evolving role of AI in evaluation processes. Our framework envisages AI as a collaborative partner in the evaluative discourse, not just the subject of evaluation.\n\nThese discussions and the nuanced adjustments will be incorporated into the latest version of our paper. We believe that these revisions will not only address your concerns but also present our results more accurately, preserving the integrity of our original assertions about the dual contributions of our method in enhancing both quantitative performance and providing qualitative insights.\n\n---\n\n**Q5: Minor suggestions**\n\nThank you for your advice for improving our paper, we will take these issues into account and incorporate the necessary amendments in the forthcoming version of our paper."

We have detailed our responses to your insightful questions and concerns below:\n\n---\n\n**Q1\uff1aWhether simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer outperform one-by-one**\n\nAs is shown in Figure 4,  'simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer' communication strategy exhibits an upward trend, achieving higher accuracy than the 'one-by-one' method under certain conditions, such as increased role numbers. However, our intention of the analysis is not to rank these strategies but rather to highlight the potential of a component that has been previously overlooked in literature. Prior studies on multi-agent debate have predominantly focused on the 'one-by-one' strategy, which we believe leaves room for further enhancement by considering various communication strategies.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Specific examples of different communication strategy**\n\nCurrently, the comprehensive algorithm is detailed in the appendix, and we will include illustrative examples in the appendix of our next version to facilitate a better understanding.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Time and money cost**\n\nWe have assessed the resource expenditure, and the following table shows our method can substantially lower both time and labor costs in comparison to the employment of human annotators.\n\n|                | Cost    | Time   |\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\n|Human             | \\$90    | 240min |\n|gpt-4 (SA)    | \\$2.90  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA ensemble)  | \\$8.70  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA chateval)  | \\$12.30 | 36min  |\n|Chatgpt(SA)   | \\$0.11  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA ensemble) | \\$0.33  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA chateval) | \\$0.41  | 11min  |\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Details about ensemble method**\n\nTo clarify the use of the ensemble method in our paper, the term 'ensemble' as used in our context refers to the procedure where we apply the SA Chain of Thought (COT) method multiple times using different role prompts across the same instance and then aggregate their results through averaging to derive the final outcome. We will amend our paper to explicitly define this process and ensure that the methodology is understandable for all readers."

We have carefully considered your points and offer our detailed responses to each concern and question below:\n\n---\n\n**Q1: Analysis of different sub-metrics**\n\nOur findings indicate that on average, our MA approach surpasses the SA method in performance when using both ChatGPT and GPT-4. However, there are subtle variations in performance across different sub-metrics between the two LLMs. Table 2 shows that for ChatGPT, MA slightly underperforms in Naturalness and Coherence but shows improvements in Engagingness and Groundedness. In contrast, MA of GPT-4 displays a more uniform improvement across three sub-metrics, with only a minor decline in Groundedness. It is also important to highlight that such variability is observed not only within our proposed metrics but also within traditional metrics and previous methods like g-eval. For instance, g-eval-4's performance dips in Engagingness and Groundedness compared to g-eval-3.5. It is notable that our GPT-4 (ChatEval) consistently excels over ChatGPT (ChatEval) in both SA and MA configurations, which is a trend we consider to be a reasonable and scalable behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Q2\uff1aQuestions on the LLMs we choose**\n\nOur focus on ChatGPT and GPT-4 stems from their recognition in prior studies as benchmarks for evaluating LLM-based evaluators https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634. They are the mostly widely used llm-based evaluators in various scenerio and has been shown effective under SA settings. This established efficacy provides a solid foundation for our decision to build upon ChatGPT and GPT-4 for our MA framework. It is reasonable to extend their proven capabilities in a SA context to a more complex MA setting, which can potentially harness and amplify the strengths of these models. In comparison, some other smaller models diverge from human preference even in SA setting, let along the multi-agent debate framework. To ensure consistency and comparability with previous research, we believe it is appropriate to conduct our experiments with these two models.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Time and money cost**\nHere we include the cost analysis table. The results indicate that while the MA debate inherently incurs higher costs, it remains significantly more cost-effective than using human annotators, both in terms of time and expense. We will incorporate this cost analysis into the forthcoming version of our manuscript. \n\n|                 | Cost    | Time   |\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\n|Human             | \\$90    | 240min |\n|gpt-4 (SA)    | \\$2.90  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA ensemble)  | \\$8.70  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA chateval)  | \\$12.30 | 36min  |\n|Chatgpt(SA)   | \\$0.11  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA ensemble) | \\$0.33  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA chateval) | \\$0.41  | 11min  |\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Implementation details**\n\n1. In the experiments involving two agents, we utilize the roles of 'general public' and 'critic'. \n2. In Figure 3, we have compared specific roles against the default setting. Here, 'general' on the x-axis refers to the default setting. \n3. Regarding the models referenced, \"ChatGPT\" corresponds to gpt-3.5turbo-0301 and \"GPT4\" to gpt-4-0314."

Some follow up on question 2 about the selection of LLMs. I agree that ChatGPT and GPT4 are widely adopted as evaluators in the literature thus should definitely be included. But I still feel that since the focus is the multi-agent frame work with LLMs, it is still important to examine other LLMs and not GPT models alone.\nMeanwhile, seems there is an assumption is that the LLM must first be good at single-agent evaluation setting in order to succeed in the multi-agent scenario, is this true. Actually I feel if through multi-agent debate weaker LLMs can obtain improvement and get close to GPT performance, it is also valuable, and might be a great choice to reduce cost as well."

As indicated in the updated table, Llama2 achieves only marginal performance under single-agent CoT methods. Despite reaching an accuracy of 37.5%, the negative kappa coefficient suggests that the observed agreement is less than what would be expected by chance. However, it's noteworthy that through the application of a multi-agent debate, Llama2 demonstrates a modest improvement, albeit still marginally above chance levels.\n\nIn contrast, Vicuna exhibits more robust performance improvement compared to Llama2. ChatEval notably enhances its capabilities, achieving an accuracy of 52.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.19, indicative of fair agreement beyond chance. While both models show limitations in their performance, **these results demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatEval and underscore its positive impact**.\n\nWe are grateful for the reviewers' insights regarding the application of ChatEval to less powerful models. Our findings demonstrate that ChatEval can still significantly enhance performance, a point we believe holds substantial value, as also echoed by the reviewers.\n\nFurthermore, we hope that our revisions and comprehensive responses have satisfactorily addressed the initial concerns.

                        "value": "We highly value your detailed feedback on our study. Please find below our response to the key issues highlighted in your comments.\n\n---\n\n**Q1: Time and money cost analysis**\n\nWe extend our gratitude to the reviewer for highlighting the importance of a time cost analysis in supporting our proposed framework. In the appended table, it is evident that the evaluator based on LLMs significantly reduces both time and financial expenditures. Although the chateval framework incurs higher costs than the SA  and MA ensemble methods due to multiple inference rounds necessary for final judgment derivation, it remains more cost-effective than employing human evaluators. We consider this an acceptable trade-off for the benefits provided.\n\n |                | Cost    | Time   |\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\n|Human             | \\$90    | 240min |\n|gpt-4 (SA)    | \\$2.90  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA ensemble)  | \\$8.70  | 10min  |\n|gpt-4 (MA chateval)  | \\$12.30 | 36min  |\n|Chatgpt(SA)   | \\$0.11  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA ensemble) | \\$0.33  | 3min   |\n|Chatgpt(MA chateval) | \\$0.41  | 11min  |\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Challenges of long context issue**\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer's point regarding the challenges of evaluating prolonged conversations, a concern shared by both academic and industrial spheres.  Within our framework, we have incorporated a summary-style communication strategy specifically designed to mitigate the issues presented by lengthy historical context. Specifically, at the end of each iteration of the debate, we will prompt an extra LLM to summarize the messages conveyed so far and use this condensed information as its historical context. The results in section 4.3 show that summary-style has a better scalable behaviour. Additionally, we would like to emphasize that the principal aim of our work is to establish a more comprehensive mechanism for evaluating textual content. The experimental results indicate that the application of a debating format can indeed catalyze improved performance. As more capable LLMs emerge, particularly those adept at managing exceptionally long contexts, our framework is inherently equipped to generalize these advancements. The integration of such LLMs is anticipated to unlock the full potential of our framework further.\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Additional results for other communication strategy**\n\nInitially, we highlighted the 'one-by-one' strategy for ChatEval as it was our primary focus and the most direct method to benchmark against existing frameworks. We agree that it is important to show a comprehensive view of the performance across different strategies. To this end, we have now included results from additional strategies in the revised tables. The data presented in the table indicate that each of the strategies yields a statistically consistent enhancement over the SA method, affirming the efficacy of our approach. For an in-depth examination of communication strategies, we recommend that reviewers refer to Section 4.2.\n\n\n|                             |                       | Acc.        | Kap          |\n|------------------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n|ChatGPT                      | SA         | $53.7_{\\pm 1.4}$ | $0.27_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|ChatGPT                      | one-by-one           | $60.0_{\\pm 0.9}$ | $0.30_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|ChatGPT                      | simultaneous-talk | $59.3_{\\pm 1.0}$ | $0.29_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|ChatGPT                     | simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer | $58.8_{\\pm 1.3}$ | $0.28_{\\pm 0.03}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | SA         | $60.8_{\\pm 0.7}$ | $0.36_{\\pm 0.01}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | one-by-one           | $63.8_{\\pm 0.9}$ | $0.40_{\\pm 0.01}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | simultaneous-talk | $63.2_{\\pm 0.6}$ | $0.38_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n|GPT-4                         | simultaneous-talk-with-summarizer | $63.4_{\\pm 0.8}$ | $0.39_{\\pm 0.02}$ |\n\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Reviewer's question on Chateval underperform Faireval**\n\nUpon reviewing the results presented in our paper, we kindly request the reviewer to re-examine the figures in table 1. It appears that the performance of chateval exceeds that of faireval, particularly concerning the Kappa correlation coefficient. \n\n---\n\n**Q5: Hallucination issues**\n\nThe issue of hallucination in LLMs is indeed prevalent, and past research has suggested that multi-agent debates can mitigate this to a certain extent https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14325. However, we consider a thorough investigation into this matter to be beyond the scope of the current paper. We believe that integrating external resources, such as search engines or databases, could be an effective strategy to curtail hallucinations. We plan to explore these possibilities and assess their compatibility with our debate framework in subsequent research endeavors."

In addition, the framework relies on prompting LLMs, however, the paper lacks sufficient information on the design of prompts and their robustness.\n2. The evaluation results present a challenge in assessing whether the multi-agent debate framework outperforms existing LLM-based evaluators in general cases. Addressing questions related to the listed questions would contribute to a more informed judgment."

Regarding Table 2, does \"MA\" in the table represent multiple agents employed in the debating way. Are there corresponding results for multiple LLMs used in an ensemble manner, aligning with the methods in Table 1?\n\n3. Considering the performance gap between G-EVAL-3.5 and ChatGPT(MA) in Table 2 for dialogue response generation, it appears that the effectiveness of the proposed framework is influenced by the chosen LLM. Has there been an evaluation of ChatEval's generalization ability?\n\n4. It seems that the G-Eval framework can be easily adapted to open-ended QA evaluation. From the performance differences in Table 2 between G-Eval and ChatEval, I wonder whether the multiple-agent debating framework really works better than the single-agent COT framework?"

                        "value": "We are grateful for your thoughtful observations on our research approach. In this response, we aim to address the points you've raised.\n\n---\n\n**Q1: The origin and the impact of varying role design as well as order issue**\n\nWe choose the role design introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15078 as a starting point to specify role prompts and facilitate a fair comparison with prior literature. As for roles design alternatives, we believe that the experiments presented in Section 4.1 probe the impact of different roles design. We design roles for different groups, and these roles perform better in their respective categories. As evident in the results, we believe the impact of role design is significant. In terms of the order issue, we have proposed \"simultaneous-talk\" communication strategy which represents a pragmatic solution to alleviate strict order constraints in contrast to one-by-one communication. It employs asynchronous functions to merge historical messages, shuffling the order of messages within the history at each round. This approach enables a flexible and dynamic interactions among agents. We will make it clearer in our next version of the paper.\n\n---\n\n**Q2: Inter-annotator agreement among agents**\n\nIn response to your question about agreement, we provide an analysis of the inter-annotator agreement experiment results in the following table. We employed ICC (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) to measure the agreement among annotators. From the table, it is evident that the annotators are generally able to reach a consensus by the end of their debate. We also observe that as we increase the number of roles, there is a decrease in agreement. It is reasonable considering that it's not also easy for a team of people to reach a consensus. Still, the overall ICC values remain at a high level, indicating strong agreement among annotators.\n\n\n  |     | 2 roles | 3 roles | 4 roles | 5 roles |\n|-----|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| ICC | 0.981   | 0.955   | 0.890   | 0.881   |\n\n\n---\n\n**Q3: Ensemble results in Table 2**\n\nHere are the results for the ensemble method applied to Topical-Chat benchmark. It is evident that the ensemble method in Topical-Chat shows some improvement compared to SA. Nevertheless, it still falls behind our Chateval framework, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n\n|                   | Nat| | Coh|       | Eng|       | Grd|       | Avg|       |\n|-------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                   |  $\\tau$ |   $\\rho$    |  $\\tau$     |   $\\rho$    |   $\\tau$    |   $\\rho$    |   $\\tau$    |   $\\rho$    |   $\\tau$    |     $\\rho$  |\n| ChatGPT(SA)       | 0.474   | 0.421 | 0.527 | 0.482 | 0.599 | 0.549 | 0.576 | 0.558 | 0.544 | 0.503 |\n| ChatGPT(Ensemble) | 0.421   | 0.359 | 0.486 | 0.442 | 0.611 | 0.551 | 0.661 | 0.628 | 0.545 | 0.495 |\n| ChatGPT(ChatEval)       | 0.441   | 0.396 | 0.500 | 0.454 | 0.664 | 0.607 | 0.602 | 0.583 | 0.552 | 0.510 |\n| GPT-4(SA)         | 0.532   | 0.483 | 0.591 | 0.535 | 0.734 | 0.676 | 0.774 | 0.750 | 0.658 | 0.611 |\n| GPT-4(Ensemble)   | 0.512   | 0.450 | 0.607 | 0.544 | 0.755 | 0.693 | 0.781 | 0.756 | 0.664 | 0.611 |\n| GPT-4(ChatEval)         | 0.630   | 0.571 | 0.619 | 0.561 | 0.765 | 0.695 | 0.722 | 0.700 | 0.684 | 0.632 |\n\n---\n\n**Q4: Generalization of ChatEval and its performance compared to G-eval**\n\nWe would like to clarify that our method is also applicable to a range of LLMs and it operates orthogonally to SA prompting techniques. It complements and extends these techniques by integrating them within a MA debate context, which can leverage the unique strengths of different LLMs in a collaborative setting. Looking ahead, we are excited about the potential of more specialized and expert-driven LLMs in different domains, which promise to further generalize our framework.\n\n It is important to note that while we benchmarked our approach against the g-eval method, the comparison may not be entirely straightforward. The g-eval method, which achieved a better 3.5 performance score, does not solely rely on COT prompting; instead, it requires access to the language model's logits. These logits are then used to perform a weighted calculation, which differs from our methodology. However, our proposed MA approach does not necessitate access to the model's logits\u2014a requirement that is often impractical in real-world applications. Consequently, it is expected that there would be performance discrepancies between our method and g-eval.\n\nAdditionally, our experimental results demonstrate that the MA approach (MA ChatEval), surpasses the performance of the SA COT method referenced in our main text. This responds to the reviewers' queries by confirming that our MA approach surpasses the SA CoT method, as clearly demonstrated by our experimental results."
