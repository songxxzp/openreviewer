Since the method mostly focuses on cross-domain recommendation, why must the authors use multimodal data?  There is almost no contribution for multimodal design.\n2. The paper simply lists related works. There is no discussion on the differences between this work and literature, making its position unclear.\n3. The designed methods are widely adopted in general domain adaptation, with small technical contributions.\n4. The experiments are only conducted on two small datasets, hard to show the generality of the method. Also, there is no mean and variance or significance test.\n5. The method uses multimodal information and cross-domain information, but the baselines only use one of them, which may be also unfair. It should be clearly stated the adopted information."

The graph attention encoder extracts node representations for each modality and then fuses them. The basic objective is to predict positive interaction of users and items.  The VAE encodes these user representations into domain-specific and domain-shared latent representations. The paper proposes intra-domain and inter-domain information bottleneck regularizations methods to get disentangled representations. The paper also proposes the cross domain knowledge alignment method to solve the problem of native semantic space heterogeneity of the two shared latent representations."

How to optimize the three parameters in equation (9) exactly?\n5. In equation (11), why only L_A has minus coefficient? It is awkward that L_A is loss function and we want to maximize it. I'm so confused about whether we want to maximize equation (10) or not.\n6. Are \\lambda in equation (10) and (11) is same?\n7. Does equation (10) mean that we want to minimize the loss of domain classifier while maximizing L_y? Why do we maximize the L_y?"
