See \"Questions\" for details."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "I have concerns and questions regarding the algorithm, the experimental setup, and the positioning wrt SoA.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n- It is not clear if the paper proposes to solve a general clustering problem, or a binary one (outlier vs. non-outlier)? \n\n- The \u201cAlgorithm\u201d and corresponding discussion in the main paper are about clustering. Do the authors also use NNs to approximate linear regression, SVD, and decision trees? If so, what are the corresponding architectures? If not, how is FedOD used with them? \n\n- The criticism of the \u201cclassical algorithms\u201d is caveated with \u201cmost\u201d and \u201cmany\u201d \u2013 So which of the \u201cclassical\u201d algorithms are amenable to federated learning? Which of them have \u201clow complexity\u201d? \n\n-The so-called \u201cdecomposition into basic operations\u201d is merely to identify them as convex or non-convex. The novel contribution is unclear. And it is not clear how the proposed algorithm solves the local minima issue in the non-convex case. \n\n-Sec 3.3: How does one sort and rank across datasets without sharing datasets? \n\n- Why does the proposed algorithm apply only to shallow OD and not to deep OD algorithms? \n\n- Section 8 states: \u201cextends its benefits to over 20 shallow (non-neural-network) OD algorithms\u201d. What are these 20 algorithms? Why are they labeled \u201cshallow\u201d? \n\nThe experimental section is unacceptable:\n\n- The choice of the \u201cdirect\u201d methods needs justification. Why is this the best state-of-the-art method for comparison? As explained in the paper, this involves training K separate models (one at each user) and then \u201cconcatenating\u201d them; so, there is no federated learning in the \u201cdirect\u201d case. Insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art. \n\n- The setting is supposed to be \u2018federated\u2019, but the experimental section provides NO details of how many clients were in the setting, and how data was distributed across the clients (iid, non-iid), how many training epochs were used, etc. \n\n- The model architecture is not clear. A fully connected MLP is mentioned at one point, but it is not clear how many layers were in the model, and the dimensions of each layer.\n\n- Inference time comparisons are provided for the proposed method vs. classical methods. Absent is a table showing the training times and training complexity. \n\n- Section C.1 states: \u201cWe also create and use synthetic datasets throughout the experiments to demonstrate the results on larger datasets.\u201d \u2013 but results of performance on synthetic datasets are not reported. These would be very insightful. \n\n- Some of the datasets described in Table C.2 are a bit odd. The Heart dataset is reported to have 44.44% outliers! Does this, in fact, mean that the Heart dataset is essentially a balanced dataset for a binary classification problem vs. say the satimae-2 dataset that has only 1.2% outliers. Am assuming that the ground truth on the outliers was provided with the datasets \u2013 if not, please clarify how the ground truth was established. \n\n- Table C3: What does \u201cAUC\u201d for ground truth mean? And what does it mean to say that the proposed algorithm is better than ground truth (\\Delta >0)? The row showing \u2018average \\Delta\u2019 is meaningless. \n\n- AUC represents a gross performance metric. It is useful but insufficient. Typically, in an OD problem, one fixes the probability of false alarm (at say 0.01 or 0.005) or the probability of missed detection, and then computes the corresponding probability of detection or of false alarm. This needs to be done. \n\n- The discussion of Table C3 is insufficient. When does the proposed method not beat the \u2018direct\u2019 method, and why?  What are the characteristics of those datasets? \n\n- If the focus of the paper is on outlier detection, why are the results on OD relegated to the appendix in the supplement?\n\n-Inference times shown in Fig 5a are meaningless without corresponding figure for accuracy. At this point, it is also not clear how FedOD is used with PCA, iForest etc. The y-axis in Fig 5d and 5e should be in log scale. \n\n-What is the performance metric in Figure 6? \n\nState-of-the-art\nThere is a large body of work on federated clustering which pays attention to data privacy.

                    "value": "1. My major concern is a Lack of theoretic explanation for the NNC, especially, how to overcome the lack of a global data view in the FL setting. It seems very difficult ' to design a loss function that allows each neural OD operator to update the model w.r.t. the local data only, to approximate the global ground truth.'\nFor example, Equation (1) does not always approximate the true global KNN Obj. Because a good clustering for each local agent does not mean that they are good from a global point of view. How good it is, and what are the costs by not having a global view, is an important research question. This needs more in-depth theoretic studies.\n\n2. In Section 4.2, only showing the KNN example is not enough for readers to judge whether the approximation approach generalize to all operators. It is also important show how other common operators are approximated in the FL setting, for example the tree-based operators.\n\n2. In equation 1, D_{i,j} is ambiguous, does it stand for D_{i,j} = cdist(X_i, X_j) ? Which violates the data preservation constraint of FL.\n\n3. Table C3 contain the main results, it should be placed in the main text rather than in the appendix. Meanwhile, in this table, FedOD sometimes surpasses the gound truth, how is that possible. The paper should provide explanation."
