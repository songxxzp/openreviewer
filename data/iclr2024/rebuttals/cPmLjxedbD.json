The authors argue that while machines with large language models and deep reinforcement learning have shown sparks of super-human intelligence in certain tasks, animals still reign supreme in primitive forms of intelligence such as smell. By using LMMs, the authors aim to build an engineering theory of cognitive development for chemosensing and advance the statistical mechanics of learning. The paper contributes to the development of a mathematically tractable framework for cognitive development and provides a complementary approach to other paths that focus on more advanced and autonomous intelligence such as natural language understanding and motor development."

Most statements in the paper are generally clear. Figure 2 is a nice conceptual diagram.\n\n**Signifiance**\nAs mentioned above, machine olfaction is relatively understudied.

It is unclear what the prior models of chemosensing are, and how the proposed model differs from prior work.\n\nSecondly, the content of the contributions seems to be lacking. Frankly, beyond motivating the problem that existing methods are unable to learn the true spectrum, I'm struggling to see what this submission contributes, although I may be missing some key aspects of the submission. One possibility to improve this submission's contribution is to derive an analytical scaling law as suggested in Section 2.3.\n\nThird, it is mentioned that one advantage of LMMs is their interpretability. It would be ideal to investigate the interpretability of LMMs experimentally.\n\nAlso, the notation is a bit unclear. I would suggest defining the dimensionalities of all the variables as well as making sure all the variables are defined as soon as they are introduced. The author may wish to consider adding a notation table.\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n\"worser than\" in Section 2.2\n\nThe parameters in Table 2 are not justified or explained"
