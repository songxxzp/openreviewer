The paper proposes a way to measure the out-of-distribution-ness using conditional entropy bottleneck. Finally the paper compares the proposed algorithm with other baselines on a rage of offline-to-online benchmarks."

                    "value": "1. The paper proposes a natural way to address the oto RL problem: during the online fine-tuning stage, performing exploration to cover the unexplored region (thus out-of-distribution) seems a very reasonable strategy, and the paper suggests that one should also perform the exploration in a more careful manner (taking the return into account), which is a reasonable heuristic in practice. \n\n2. The proposed algorithm is easy to understand and extensible (for a wide range of offline RL methods). \n\n3. The empirical performance seems strong."

Although there seems no issue with the technical part of the paper, I do want to bring the attention to a recent paper: Reward-agnostic Fine-tuning: Provable Statistical Benefits of Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10282). I believe this paper, from the theory perspective, proposes the same intuition as the current paper: after running model-based offline RL on the offline dataset, one could use the model to estimate the occupancy measure of the offline policy, and thus have the knowledge of the uncovered directions from the offline data, and during online fine-tuning, one could use exploration to collect the data in the remaining directions. To me the current paper shares a lot of intuition with this earlier paper, minus many empirical considerations, which are also good contributions. \n\n2. Other than CEB, there might be many other methods for measuring the out-of-distributioness. It would improve the paper if there are more ablations. \n\n3. The experiment section seems to miss of of the benchmarks that are tested in cal-QL. \n\n4. Minor point: in the related work section, two cited paper (Nair et al., 2020 and Song et al., 2023) seem to be more general than just using expert demonstration. I believe they also use the more general offline data (the same as the ot2 setting)."

Please find our responses to your questions below, and we kindly ask whether Reviewer Q4z6 would be willing to increase their score or let us know if further clarifications are needed.\n\n\n**Suggested theory paper in tabular MDPs**\n\n\nWe thank Reviewer Q4z6 for pointing us to this interesting reference. We were not aware of this work, but we have now included it in our Related Work section.\n\n\n**Other representation learning methods**\n\n\nIn principle, representation learning methods other than the CEB can be used within PTGOOD. However, as we highlight in Section 4.2, CEB-learned representations have been shown to work well in out-of-distribution detection tasks, which is a property that is useful for PTGOOD\u2019s purposes.\n\n\n**Request to include environments from the Cal-QL study**\n\n\nWe specifically avoid using datasets that contain demonstrations of expert or hand-crafted policies (i.e., policies that successfully complete the task in the case of binary success tasks like Kitchen or optimal policies like in HalfCheetah Expert.) We motivate this setting in our introduction and reiterate it in our Related Work section. Below, we will go through each of the datasets used in the Cal-QL paper\u2019s main results (Figure 6), and highlight that each of these datasets contains trajectories that violate this dataset selection criterion.\n\n\nAll four of the AntMaze datasets used in the Cal-QL paper are collected by expert policies. The D4RL documentation (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl/wiki/Tasks#antmaze) describes the trajectories as being generated by \u201ccommanding random goal locations in the maze and navigating the ant to them.\u201d Also, the D4RL paper (Fu et al., 2021) states that the AntMaze datasets are generated by first \u201ctraining a goal reaching policy.\u201d\n\n\nAll three of the Kitchen datasets are filled with trajectories that successfully complete the task. The documentation (https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/d4rl/wiki/Tasks#frankakitchen) states that the datasets \u201cincludes demonstrations of all 4 target subtasks being completed\u201d and the D4RL paper describes the Kitchen datasets as coming from \u201chuman demonstrations\u201d that are either \u201cperforming all of the desired tasks\u201d or \u201cperforming subtasks.\u201d  \n\n\nThe Pen, Door, and Relocate datasets are also filled with trajectories that successfully complete the task. The Cal-QL paper describes these datasets with: \u201cEach of these tasks only provides a narrow offline dataset \tconsisting of 25 demonstrations collected via human teleoperation and additional trajectories collected by a BC policy.\u201d Additionally, the D4RL paper describes these datasets with: \u201cThis domain was selected to measure the effect of a narrow expert data distributions and human demonstrations.\u201d \n\n\nThe Cal-QL authors do not provide the dataset used in the Visual Manipulation environment, but they do refer to its datasets as containing \u201cnarrow\u201d behavior, which is verbiage often used to describe datasets collected by expert policies. These datasets appear to come from Ebert et al., (2021), who describe the datasets as being collected via teleoperation specifically for imitation learning purposes, which suggests that the trajectories within the dataset successfully complete the tasks."

In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of offline-to-online RL, with numerous relevant works published. It is crucial for the authors to include and discuss these more recent works in the related works section, like AWAC[1], E2O[2], PROTO[3], SUNG[4] and PEX[5].\n3.

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer 3FpJ for their time and comments. We are glad they found our paper to be well-written and easy to follow and that our work provides an interesting perspective on the offline-to-online problem. We have added additional baselines that Reviewer 3FpJ requested, which can be seen in our newly uploaded PDF. Please find our responses to your questions below, and we kindly ask whether Reviewer 3FpJ would be willing to increase their score or let us know if further clarifications are needed.\n\n\n**Request for more environments from D4RL**\n\n\nWe specifically do not use all of the environment-dataset combinations in the D4RL suite because many of them violate our selection criteria (explained in section 6.2.) Many of the environment-dataset combinations in D4RL can be solved to (near-) optimality during the offline pretraining phase. Such environment-dataset combinations are uninteresting in the OtO setting and violate our criterion 1, which is defined in Section 6.2. On the other hand, some of the environment-dataset combinations provide such poor coverage of the MDP (e.g., the Random dataset in D4RL\u2019s Walker2d) that offline pretraining provides virtually no benefit (violating criterion 2 which is defined in Section 6.2.) As a result, we collect several of our own datasets in environments that are not represented in D4RL, such as Ant, Humanoid, and DMC Walker, for a total of 7 environment-dataset combinations. These datasets comprise a portion of our work\u2019s contribution to the research community, and we will release them to the public in our work\u2019s code repository.\n\n**Request for more baselines**\n\n\nWe have added two of the requested baselines (PROTO and PEX) to the main results in Table 2, Figure 11, and Figure 12. Two of the other requested baselines (E2O and SUNG) do not have code provided by the authors. The final baseline (AWAC) is outperformed by the two baselines we have already added, and therefore it would likely not provide additional information. We highlight that PTGOOD, our contribution, significantly outperforms both PROTO and PEX in all of our benchmarks.\n\n\n**Cal-QL performance**\n\n\nThe environments used in the Cal-QL paper (Figure 6) contain trajectories of expert policies. This property is useful for Cal-QL since it contains a learning mechanism that keeps the learned policy close to the policy that collected the datasets (Equation 3.1 in the Cal-QL paper.) In contrast, we specifically avoid datasets that show expert behavior and instead only choose datasets collected by highly-suboptimal policies. We outline our dataset selection criteria in Section 6.2. As we explain in paragraph four of section 6.3, Cal-QL\u2019s poor performance in these datasets should not be surprising, since it is actively keeping its learned policy close to the highly-suboptimal dataset-collection policy. The same should be true for any of the other algorithms that use the \u201cconservative\u201d and/or \u201cpessimistic\u201d mechanisms.\n\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that the Cal-QL paper records agent returns over one million or more online fine-tuning steps. In contrast, our work records agent performance over only 50k timesteps, which represents a small fraction of the x-axis of the plots in Figure 6 of the Cal-QL paper.\n\n\n**Traditional exploration methods**\n\n\nWe display in our experiment section (e.g., Table 2) that traditional exploration methods, such as intrinsic rewards and UCB exploration, work fine, but not as well as PTGOOD. Also, we perform hyperparameter tuning for each one of these baselines, as seen in Figures 3-7. We also show that following the policy without any exploration guidance (Naive) works fine but also significantly underperforms PTGOOD.\n\n\n**Algorithm used during online fine-tuning phase**\n\n\nAll of our baselines (except for Cal-QL, PROTO, and PEX) and PTGOOD use model-based policy optimization (MBPO) and Soft-Actor critic (SAC), as we mention in the first paragraph of Section 6.1. Combining SAC with MBPO is standard practice and works well, as shown in the original MBPO paper (Janner et al., 2019)."

In particular, the proposed planning to go out of distribution (PTGOOD) treats this problem as an exploration problem and encourages the exploration on the dataset that is unlikely to be visited by the behavior policy. The experiments show that the proposed method can improve the learning performance comparing with previous methods."

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer Ftkq for their time and comments. We are glad they found our work to be novel. Please find our responses to your questions below, and we kindly ask whether Reviewer Ftkq would be willing to increase their score based on our responses or let us know if further clarifications are needed. Also, please see our updated PDF to see additional results we have added during the rebuttal period.\n\n\n**Question about finding relatively-high reward regions**\n\n\nWe highlight in Section 6.4 that the relatively high-reward regions are found by keeping exploration \u201cclose\u201d to the improving policy. Due to the agent\u2019s learning process (via RL), it should visit increasingly higher-reward regions of the MDP\u2019s state-action space naturally. As we show in the experiment in Section 6.4 and Figure 2, keeping the exploration process \u201cclose\u201d to this improving policy is critical. This is shown by the large decrease in returns throughout training when the planning noise is too high.\n\n\n**Question about the relation between dynamics modeling accuracy and agent performance**\n\n\nThis is an interesting question. Ideally, the learned dynamics model would be an oracle over the MDP\u2019s entire state-action space (both in terms of reward- and transition-prediction.) However, our paper\u2019s focus is on the limited-interaction setting. Therefore, we cannot afford to have the agent explore the MDP exhaustively, which would likely be required to achieve an oracle model. In our case, it is not so clear over which regions of the MDP\u2019s state-action space we should measure the dynamics model\u2019s accuracy and other performance metrics.\n\n\nAlso, some recent works (e.g., Lambert et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2023), have shown that dynamics model prediction accuracy is not well correlated with agent performance. This is often called the \u201cobjective mismatch\u201d between dynamics modeling and policy optimization of rewards. Because of this mismatch, it would probably be difficult to draw meaningful conclusions by observing modeling accuracy.\n\n\n**Explanation of the low variance in Figure 1**\n\n\nCould Reviewer Ftkq please clarify their question? In Figure 1, sometimes the variance across seeds is small when lambda is small, but sometimes the variance across seeds is large when lambda is small. The same is also true for relatively large values of lambda. So we are unsure what the reviewer is referring to specifically."
