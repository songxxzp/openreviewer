                    "value": "This paper considers the problem of designing exploration schemes that are simple, general, and computationally efficient. Towards this end, the authors propose to combine three basic functions: a new beta function the authors learned to explore under-explored actions, the usual Q function for exploring overestimated actions, and finally a Q_mask function designed for exploitation. A diverse set of policies is constructed from them to encourage space coverage or bias correction, and the specific policy used per episode is selected by a meta-controller in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit fashion. Experiments are performed on a few environments and various components of the proposed method are analyzed, which validates the soundness of the proposed exploration scheme."

It makes sense to me by combining the three basic functions to construct a set of policies that explore for space coverage and another set of policies that explore for bias correction. The toy example on CliffWalk and the related figures are very helpful in understanding/visualizing the method. There are also experimental ablation studies on the method. Overall, the evaluation seems to confirm that this is a sound approach."

Given the simplicity and generality of the method, it makes sense to conduct a larger-scale experiments, e.g., divide all environments on Atari into easy/hard exploration tasks and see if one can systematically analyze the performance gain/loss of the method and whether interesting insights could be drawn as a whole. While the method works right now as of the current presentation, it's unclear how those environments are selected."

For example, this makes intuitive sense: \"At the beginning, the exploration policies for data coverage (\u03c0cov) are chosen more frequently. After a good coverage of the whole state space, the exploration policies for bias correction (\u03c0cor) are chosen more frequently in this sparse reward environment.\" The pattern however does not hold and becomes more complicated in Section 5.3.1 (Figure 4). Could the authors perform more experiments on a diverse environments to see if any insights can be obtained collectively wrt the environment charactristics? \n2. In Section 5.3.2, \"The policy argmax Q takes greedy actions among the whole action space, it may take overestimated actions thus the performance is not as stable as argmax Qmask.\"  Figure 5 doesn't seem to suggest any clearly difference in terms of stability, though argmax Q_mask does perform better."

                        "value": "- The pattern however does not hold and becomes more complicated in Section 5.3.1 (Figure 4).\n\nIn our current experiments, we find that in simple (LavaCrossing-Easy) or dense reward (Asterix) environments, exploring for bias correction plays a more important role. In hard exploration environments (RedBlue-Doors, LavaCrossing-Hard), the two kinds of policies interleave and result in a more intricate selection pattern. \nWe distill these insights as follows: In simpler environments, the emphasis is on efficiently discovering low-hanging-fruit rewards, prioritizing exploitation over extensive exploration. In contrast, in challenging exploration environments, the importance of state-novelty exploration is heightened, resembling the principles of depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS). Our approach adapts to this context: upon encountering positive rewards, it adopts a depth-first exploration strategy, delving deeper into discovered areas for further exploration. Conversely, in the absence of immediate rewards, the strategy shifts towards a breadth-first approach, exploring widely to uncover promising areas.\n\n- argmax Q is not as stable as argmax Qmask in Figure 5.\n\nThanks for pointing out this. A more precise description would be argmax Q does not perform as well as argmax Qmask because it may select overestimated actions. We will revise the description to accurately reflect this distinction."

High-level idea: the key insight behind exploration is not simply to visit the actions that are infrequently visited, but to add frequency measure (like the count-based methods) to the value, to perform an exploration-exploitation trade-off. The idea of learning a behaviour density estimator is interesting, but integrating this idea with a count-based MAB exploration algorithm makes the algorithm no longer elegant, and hard to identify the performance improvement.\n\n2. The presentation of the paper can be improved. There are many misleading terminology usages. e.g., the *space coverage*, *bias correction*, what does those terms mean in this context?\n\n3. Is the MAB trained concurrently with the Q networks? How does the choice of hyper-parameters affect learning stability (it was partially revealed in Figure 6). In practice, is there a golden standard for selecting those hyper-parameters?\n\n4. It would be helpful to have a standard deviation in results (table 1.)\n\n5. In Equation (1), it\u2019s not clear what \\beta exactly is and how it is parameterised and optimised. Is it a supervised / behaviour cloning policy?\n\n6. Some related works are missing: \n\nEnsemble:\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01929.pdf discussed ensemble methods in DQN.\n- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07288.pdf discussed the ensemble methods using different hyperparameter settings.\n\nCuriosity-Driven Exploration:\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08332 BYOL-Explore is one of the state-of-the-art exploration algorithms for discrete and continuous control\n- https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10515\n- https://openreview.net/forum?id=_ptUyYP19mP further improves the RND\n\n7. The authors mentioned Montezuma's Revenge environment in the introduction but did not experiment in this challenging setting. I wonder if the authors could provide results in such a setting.\n\n---\n\nI'm happy to re-evaluate the work if those questions can be addressed."

For example, the idea of learning in-sample state-action pairs in Eq. (2) is similar to Eq. (4.1) in BAC. The idea of making trade-off between standard and conservative Q-value functions in Eq. (5) is similar to Eq. (4.3) in BAC. Apart from being overlapped with BAC, the idea of constructing a policy set has been extensively studied in literature, e.g. [2].\n2.

                        "value": "- Related work and baselines\n\nWe will discuss these related work and add more baselines in the next version. \nBAC [1] is a concurrent work which is also submitted to ICLR2024 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=VPx3Jw2MSk). We will compare with it in the next paper version. While both works consider in-distribution learning, which makes them similar at the high level, the methods used are very different.  BAC blends two operators to trade off exploitation (IQL-style) and exploration (SAC-style), while our method uses a behavior function $\\beta$ as a mask to switch the mode between exploitation and exploration. In this way we can explicitly generate a group of policies ranging from pure exploitation to exploration with Q and $\\beta$, while BAC cannot. \nFurther, the BAC method tunes parameters for each task individually to get high performance, while we used a single set of parameters for all tasks. This reduces the burden of hyper-parameter tuning.\n\nThe idea of constructing a policy set has been extensively studied in the literature [2,3,4,5]. All these methods maintain a group of policies with independent parameters. The computational cost blows up and is unaffordable for most research communities. In contrast, our method constructs a set of diverse policies from only one additionally learned behavior function, which is\nstraightforward to implement and computationally efficient.\n\n- $\\beta$ is learned with supervised learning, and is not robust when facing policy or dynamics shifts.\n\nIn online learning, since the replay memory changes with every environment step, $\\beta$ and $Q$ keep changing accordingly. The role of $\\beta$ is to estimate the current replay memory content, and it should be updated with the changing memory. The supervised learning of $\\beta$ is more straightforward and stable compared to the concurrent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of $Q$. The inherent stability of learning $\\beta$ stems from its simplified nature, contributing to a robust training process.\n\n- The DQN-style formulation constrains the action space to be discrete.\n\nThe DQN-style formulation, by design, restricts the action space to be discrete. Our method is an improvement for DQN, it cannot be applied directly to continuous action space. Addressing this limitation and extending our method to accommodate continuous action spaces is an intriguing avenue for future work.\n\n[1] Ji T, Luo Y, Sun F, et al.

                    "value": "1. The proposed algorithm is limited to the discrete action domain while most other exploration algorithms do not have such a limitation, and there is no obvious way to directly apply it to the continuous action domains. \n2. The environments of choice are not standard, and potentially too easy to solve. The scale of both environments is too small, and it is skeptical that the proposed algorithm does not scale to a more standard discrete action domain like Atari. The details of my concern are the following:\n* First, the behavior policy \\beta is changing every environment step, which means that the \"mask\" is changing every step. Given that the experiments are only conducted in environments with a limited diversity of observations, the stability of the algorithm when learning in a more complex environment is concerning.\n3. The baselines are not tuned, and the selection of the baseline does not align with the main motivation of the experiment. I am going to decompose my reasons as the following:\n* The purpose of this paper is to propose a computationally efficient, hyperparameter-insensitive, and well-performing exploration algorithm. However, $\\beta$-DQN has two hyperparameters, $L$ and policy set size. Policy set size controls the hardness of the MAB algorithm, whereas the $L$ affects the process of the learning of MAB. The authors provide an ablation study on the analysis of the sensitivity of the size of the policy set but do not provide the ablation study on $L$, which is not enough to convince the reader that $\\beta$-DQN is not sensitive to hyperparameters.\n* As the authors mentioned in the paper, most exploration algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameters. For intrinsic-reward based ones, they are particularly sensitive to the bonus scale factor $\\alpha$. Specifically, the implementation of RND is from the LESSON paper by Kim et al., but the authors use a different $\\alpha$ in this paper and achieved better performance compared to the RND in LESSON paper, which further shows that the the hyperparameter selection can be crucial for the performance of exploration algorithm like RND. Without the systematic tuning of hyperparameters for the baselines, it is hard to convince the readers that $\\beta$-DQN is preferred. Additionally, the ablation study of the size of the policy set does not show an insensitivity of $\\beta$-DQN to this hyperparameter.\nOverall, the experiment setup, including the choice of environments, the hyperparameter selections for baselines, and the ablation study on hyperparameters of $\\beta$-DQN, does not provide enough information for the reader to decide whether or not $\\beta$-DQN is more hyperparameter insensitive, or performs better than other exploration methods."

The detailed suggestions are the following:  \n1. Tune the hyperparameters of RND, Bootstrapped DQN in a systematic manner, and show that even the best hyperparameter would not yield better performance compared to $\\beta$-DQN, i.e. showing that $\\beta$-DQN is indeed favorable compared to them.\n2. Compare $\\beta$-DQN against the public implementation of RND-PPO and Bootstrapped DQN with the original selection of hyperparameters on the Atari domain, on two sets of environments one contains environments with sparse reward and requiring heavy exploration, the other contains environments with dense reward where even $\\epsilon$-greedy can perform well. \n3. Provide a more systematic ablation study for the hyperparameter of $\\beta$-DQN."

We will extend it to continuous action space in future work.\n\n- The behavior policy \\beta is changing every environment step.\n\nIndeed, the dynamic nature of the behavior policy $\\beta$ aligns with our objective. In the context of online learning, the replay memory changes with every environment step. $\\beta$ serves as an estimation of the replay memory and should be updated along with the evolving memory content. Supervised learning of $\\beta$ is more straightforward than concurrent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) of $Q$, where both $\\beta$ and $Q$ are subject to continuous adjustments. The simpler learning task for $\\beta$ leads to inherent greater stability and contributes to a robust training process.\n\n- The baselines are not tuned.\n\nWe did tune each baseline and achieved higher performance than in the original paper. For example, untuned RND and LESSON by Kim et al. achieve success rates of around 0.1 and 0.2 on LavaCrossingS9N1 (LavaCrossing-Easy in our paper). In our paper, these baseline methods are tuned to achieve 0.63 and 0.75, much higher than the original paper. We found that these intrinsic reward based methods are sensitive to hyperparameters.\n\n- Ablation study and systematic hyperparameters tuning of baselines.\n\nWe appreciate the systematic suggestions provided. In our next version, we will conduct an ablation study and undertake a more comprehensive systematic hyperparameter tuning of baselines.\n\nRegarding the ablation study on $L$, a rough search among $L$ in [100, 500, 1000, 2000] on SimpleCrossing-Easy and Asterix found no obvious differences between 500, 1000 and 2000, and lower performance for $L=100$. Based on this preliminary experiment, we fixed $L= 1000$ for all environments. We can do a grid search for $L$ for all environments."

                    "value": "This paper proposed a new method to perform diverse exploration in the reinforcement learning setting. A behavior function beta is learned on in-sample data to model the coverage of different state action pairs. Then standard DQN learning learns a state-action value function Q. Based on the behavior function and the state-action value function Q, the authors proposed to construct a new Q_mask function that corresponds to a pure exploitation policy due to that less explored actions are suppressed by altering its Q value. Next the paper constructs two basic policies pi_cov and pi_cor that aim at better coverage and bias correction respectively. From there, a set of diverse policies are created. These diverse policies have different levels of exploration and exploitation that intuitively help with the learning process. A meta controller is designed based on non-stationary multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to select a policy from the diverse set, which is then used to interact with the underlying environment to collect new data. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodoloy."

                        "value": "- Technical contribution. \n\nOur paper is motivated by the fact that while many complex methods have been proposed for efficient exploration, the most commonly used ones are still simple methods such as $\\epsilon$-greedy and entropy regularization [1,2]. Previous literature attributes this to two key challenges of other methods: their increased complexity and lack of generality [3,4]. In response, our contribution is a simple yet effective exploration method which enhances the performance of DQN. Our idea is simple and straightforward to implement, which we consider an advantage.\n\n- No theoretical results. \n\nOur paper is experimental, focused on empirical results rather than theoretical analysis. Other well-known simple yet effective practical exploration approaches include $\\epsilon z$-greedy [4] and RND [5]. Our work builds on and extends this empirical tradition, and contributes to the understanding of exploration strategies through a series of experiments.\n\n- Not clear how well .. generalizes to more complicated scenarios such as continuous environments. \n\nAs an improvement for DQN, our method does not apply directly to continuous action spaces. However, it is suitable for state spaces that are continuous/high-dimensional. Our current experiments are all on image-based domains. While MinAtar is simpler than Atari it is also high-dimensional, in 4 out of 5 games (all except Breakout) trajectories do not overlap in practice [6]. Even for minigrid, the tasks are not simple for current algorithms. For example, in our results for LavaCrossing-Hard, no algorithm can learn to reliably reach a goal state within 5 million steps. This is still a very challenging testbed worth deeper research.\n\n[1] Mnih, Volodymyr, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Andrei A. Rusu, Joel Veness, Marc G.
