                        "value": "Dear Reviewer hqfj, \n\nThank you for taking the time to review. We appreciate that you found our paper well-written and the literature review comprehensive. \nWe would like to make the following clarifications about your concern. If you find these responses useful to address your questions and concerns, we would be grateful and would consider increasing your score. \n\nWe summarize the mentioned concerns and we hope the corresponding comments address your concerns, we would be grateful if you could consider increasing the review score.\n\n> Q: More information on specific steps and instructions for each algorithm is needed.\n\n**A**: Thanks for reminding us of the specific steps, which is helpful for readers to better comprehend our methods. In our original paper, we unify the evolutionary algorithms in a framework. Considering your comments, we have updated our draft and added detailed algorithms for GA and DE, respectively (See Appendix A for details of implementation). We hope this can be responsive to your concerns. Additionally, we have attached the corresponding code in the supplementary materials. Later we will release our code to the public.\n\n> Q: How the algorithms are adapted to work with discrete prompts and how the LLMs are used to generate new candidate prompts?\n\n**A**: LLMs play a role in generating new prompts based on evolutionary operators including mutation and crossover according to the given candidates. Figure 1 and Figure 2 in the paper provide detailed instructions on guiding LLMs to generate a new discrete prompt. Meanwhile, we utilize the selection and updating strategy in evolutionary algorithms to control convergence and effectiveness. \n\n> Q: This paper could include more ablation studies to better understand the impact of different components of the proposed method, such as the effect of different population sizes, mutation rates, or selection strategies.\n\n**A:** Sec. 5.1 and 5.2 in our original paper have explored the effect of important components designed in GA and DE respectively. Particularly, for GA (Sec. 5.1), we mainly analyze the selection strategy including the random, tournament roulette wheel strategy. For DE (Sec. 5.2), we demonstrate the importance of mutation over different parts and the selection of Prompt 3 in Figure 2. Due to the space limitation, the study on population sizes is in Appendix C.1 of our paper.\n\nBesides, we would like to appreciate your suggestion about the mutation rates. Considering the LLMs may struggle with the rate of concrete float value since at the level of natural language, it is hard to measure the mutation extent, we leave this for future work. \n\nWe also want to kindly remind you that the discussion phase will end soon, so we would greatly appreciate your support in this regard before the deadline."

The EvoPrompt has been instantiated to both Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Differential Evolution (DE) versions. Comprehensive experiments across 31 datasets have demonstrated the efficacy and good performance of EvoPrompt when tested on both closed-source and open-source LLMs."

However, the search doesn't appear to converge in Figure 6. Is it possible to illustrate the effects of more iterations? It's unclear if these 10 iterations are conducted within a single LLM session or if each iteration starts with a new session. Besides, more details should be provided regarding the runtime, and resources for running the GA.\n* It would be beneficial if the authors could present negative examples where EvoPrompt failed, as this could inspire direction for future research.

How effectively can EvoPrompt discover novel prompts utilizing EA operators? (e.g., considering factors such as prompt length and the variance in approaches between new and prior prompts). \n3. When the LLM generates mutated new words, is there adequate diversity in the new words introduced, or is there a repetition of the same words?\n4. See other questions in the weakness part.\n5.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer HRoN,\n\nThank you for your positive and thoughtful feedback and look into every detail of our work. We appreciate that you found our paper well-written and experiments commendable. We summarize the mentioned concerns and we hope the corresponding comments address your concerns, and we would be grateful if you could consider increasing the review score.\n\n> Q: EvoPrompt\u2019s performance may be influenced by initial prompts.\n\nA: In Sec 5.3, we investigate the effect of initial population quality. The results of random-k and top-k initialization exhibit a high degree of similarity and the random setting is more in line with the real situation. This suggests that EvoPrompt does not depend on carefully crafted manual prompts. Instead, even randomly selected prompts can achieve a good performance. Additionally, though DE (48.64) and GA (47.80) starting from the selected bottom population perform not that well, they still outperform APE (46.32), demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of EvoPrompt.\n\n> Q: Deeper analysis for DE\u2019s exploration over GA. \\& Diversity of prompts\n\nA: We are very grateful for your insightful comments on comparing DE and GA from this perspective. Considering your suggestions, We mainly analyze prompt diversity through the following aspects: 1) the average length of the prompt and the corresponding variance in the population; 2) the number of new words after each iterative step; 3) the case study. We will briefly summarize the results in this response. \n\n* **Average length and variance**: From Figure 9 (a, b) in the Appendix, DE shows higher length and variance than GA. This implies that the prompts generated in DE are more diverse in terms of length. \n\n* **Number of new words**: From Figure 9 (c), we can observe that in the latter iterations, DE mutates more new words than GA, and thus shows better potential to explore and escape from the local optimum.\n\n* **Case study**: in Figure 1 (GA) and Figure 2 (DE), the given examples are taken from our experimental logs. \n**1)** For GA, in the final prompt (at the bottom), words in orange and blue are inherited from the parental prompts respectively, and words in black are mutated parts. \n**2)** For DE, comparing the final generated prompt (wrapped by a box at the bottom) with the basic prompt (in the upper part of the figure, prompt in blue words), the new prompt keeps half of the original one, while the other half derives from crossover and mutation referring to other candidates. DE keeps the common parts between the given candidates as repetition and only performs mutation on different parts. Both of them have repetitions and mutations, corresponding to exploitation and exploration.\n\nResults related to prompt diversity revealed that DE tends to generate more diverse prompts than GA. This result also indicates that DE is potentially better at exploration than GA. Please see Appendix C.4 in our revised version for more details. Thank you again for your insightful comments on comparing DE and GA from this perspective. \n\n> Q: The search doesn't appear to converge and it is possible to illustrate the effects of more iterations.\n\n**A**: We increase the iteration steps and there\u2019s still slight performance gain on the Subj dataset, but EvoPrompt, both GA and DE versions, on most of the datasets converge around 10 steps. To maintain uniformity and reduce hyperparameter elaboration in the experimental setup, we selected a consistent value of 10 across all tasks. \nIt's true that at the iteration of 10, the average score still shows an increasing trend but there exists a trade-off between the number of iterative steps and performance. If we continue evolving until convergence, the best score of DE can rise. \nPlease refer to Appendix C.3 for more detailed demonstrations.\n\n\n> Q: Are 10 iterations conducted in a single LLM session or a distinct new session?\n\nA: Each evolution is in a distinct new session."

                        "value": "Our responses to the rest of the questions are as follows. \n\n> Q: Details about the runtime and resources.\n\nA: Please refer to our general responses on cost analysis for details related to resources. The runtime varies from each dataset, the table below lists the runtime when optimizing for Alpaca on a single V100 GPU (except that BBH is optimized for GPT3.5). Additionally, the runtime of evaluation depends on iterations, the size of the population and the size of the dev set. Here we show the time under our default setting. The time for evaluation is almost the same for APE and our methods. Note that each task in BBH takes about the same amount of time to run.\n\n|                | SST-2 | CR   | MR   | SST-5 | AG's News | TREC | Subj | ASSET | BBH  |\n| -------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ----- | --------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- |\n| Runtime (mins) | 63    | 63   | 65   | 90    | 162       | 99   | 194  | 163   | 86   |\n\n> Q: Negative examples where EvoPrompt fails and the limitations can lead to future investigation.\n\nA: In our results of Big-Bench Hard, there are several tasks that either EvoPrompt (GA) or EvoPrompt (DE) fails. This is because the distribution of the randomly sampled dev set is not aligned with the test set, resulting in a performance gap between the evaluations based on them. Accordingly, though EvoPrompt gets a better prompt based on the dev set, it may not perform as well when tested on the test set. Thus, constructing a more effective dev set could further enhance the performance, which needs future investigation.\n\n> Q: What is the ratio of manually created and LLM-generated prompts in the initial population when DE works better than GA? & What would be the performance of EvoPrompt if the initial prompts were all generated by LLM?\n\nA: There are two ratios of manually written prompts in the initial population, before top-k and after top-k and variations. Before selecting top-k, the ratio of manually written prompts is around 50\\%. The ratio after top-k and variations are listed in the table below. We haven't observed a significant correlation between the ratio of manual prompts in the initial population and the performance. \n\n|                 | SST-2 | CR    | MR    | SST-5 | AG's News | TREC  | Subj  | ASSET |\n| --------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |\n| Score (GA)      | 95.13 | 91.27 | 90.07 | 49.91 | 72.81     | 64.00 | 70.55 | 46.43 |\n| Score (DE)      | 94.75 | 91.40 | 90.22 | 49.89 | 73.82     | 63.73 | 75.55 | 46.21 |\n| Ratio of manual | 0.37  | 0.50  | 0.20  | 0.23  | 0.47      | 0.00  | 0.30  | 0.33  |\n\nAdditionally, here we conduct experiments with the initial prompts generated by LLMs completely, as shown in the table below. We can observe that for SST-5, initialization has little impact. \n\n| Method             | SST-5 |\n| ------------------ | ----- |\n| APE                | 46.32 |\n| GA                 | 49.91 |\n| GA (-manual)| 49.98 |\n| DE                 | 49.89 |\n| DE (-manual) | 50.06 |\n\n> Q: Will there be any benefits to combining and alternating GA and DE updates during the search?\n\nA: Thanks for your comments. It\u2019s a promising suggestion. The selection and updating strategy differ from DE and GA, making the combination non-trivial. We will further investigate this for our extensions."

                    "value": "In this paper, the authors present EvoPrompt, a framework to combine Evolution Strategies and a Language Model to engineer prompts to improve the performance of possibly another Language Model on a variety of instruction tasks. The authors mention that the prompt used to instruct an LLM strongly influences its performance and that human crafted prompts are often sub-optimal thus motivating the need to use optimization algorithms to generate prompts so as to maximize the performance of an LLM on a given task. In that context, the authors motivate the use of Evolution based algorithms as they typically perform great on discrete sequential data and offer a good way to balance exploration and exploitation. Evolution algorithms also have the benefit from performing black box optimization - they do not access to the function or its gradient - which allows users to use them with models that are only accessible through an API for instance. However, standard mutation and crossover functions  that typically invert / replace / mutate individual elements in the discrete sequences without maintaining global coherence which would lead these operators to quickly generate prompts that are unreadable and non interpretable. Therefore, the authors propose to use an LLM to perform crossover and mutation operations to always generate coherent and meaningful new samples. The authors compare to Evolution strategies - genetic algorithms and differential evolution - and benchmark their method on a variety of tasks including language understanding and summarization. The method is applied both to Alpaca (instruction-fine tuned Llama which is open-source) and to GPT-3.5 (proprietary model accessible through an API). They compare obtained to several baselines and propose some ablations to study the impact of mutation strategy used and the impact of the initial population."

The method is also clearly explained and detailed which makes it easy for the reader to understand what is going on and which might help to reproduce the work as well. I also really enjoyed Figure 1 and 2 which are very clean, colorful and do a great job at illustrating the method.\n\nThe method itself is sound and I agree that Evolution Strategies make a lot of sense for this problem for all the reasons mentioned. I mainly like the way crossover and mutation is implemented by querying an LLM. I find this idea very powerful as indeed, in most cases the main challenge in using EAs lies in defining operators that can stay in the data distribution when perturbing samples. \n\nI also find the experimental setup convincing as the authors performed a large number of experiments and compared to several relevant baselines. The fact that the method was illustrated both on an open-source and on a proprietary model also strengthened that part and I also like that the authors illustrated how to apply their method and LLM-based evo operator with two different types of Evolution Strategies."

However, I acknowledge that there are ongoing efforts in that field and while I personally don't find it very exciting or relevant, this work contributes efficiently to this research track.\n\nI also have some doubts about the relevance of this work to ICLR. In my opinion, the main contribution of this work is this LLM-based mutation/crossover operator which would make more sense in an evolutionary algorithms conference such as GECCO than at ICLR. \n\nFinally, I think that this work would strongly benefit from a study of the computational cost of the approach in the main core of the paper. I saw some elements that could help towards this end in the supplementary, but I would like to see an analysis of the computational cost / financial cost and time needed to perform this optimization. It would be interesting also to add similar analysis for the baselines. I think this would be very useful to the readers to evaluate to what extent they could apply that to their research if they have either to serve themselves Alpaca on an accelerator or to query the OpenAI API after connecting their credit card."

It might be an idea for the next one though ;)). However, I have some doubts if ICLR is the best place for that as I think GECCO would be better suited. Therefore, I will say minor accept for now but I would be happy to increase my grade if the reviewers and other authors convince me that actually ICLR is the right place.\n\n\n**A few other general comments**:\n\n- As mentioned above, I think this would be very exciting to apply these LLM-based evo operators to other applications. For instance this could be used to generate game levels through textual description or coding exercises. With latest models such as DALLE-3, the same strategy could be applied to generate images.  \n\n- The authors mention that EA are good at balancing exploration and exploration, however it is not always the case and this is for instance often a limitation of GA methods. I would recommend the authors to have a glance at the Quality Diversity literature with algorithms such as MAP-Elites which are much better at balancing exploration. I think it would be very exciting to use EvoPrompt on top of a QD method.\n\n- In the conclusion, the authors mention looking at Simulated Annealing (SA) for future work. In my experience, GA and other more recent EAs always outperform SA by a strong margin (if correctly tuned and implemented). Thus, I would not advise going in that correction. QD methods are probably going to be more fun. Looking at multi-objectives methods such as NSGA-II might be interesting as well."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer LYv4,\n\nThank you for taking the time to review and propose promising extensions. We appreciate that you found our paper well-written and sound with convincing results. If the following comments address your concerns, we would be grateful if you could consider increasing the review score.\n\nFirstly, we would like to clarify our **motivation for focusing on prompts**. \n\n* We kindly argue that prompts for large language models (LLMs) are crucial, as provide a necessary interface to interact with black-box LLMs. In the era of LLMs, the fine-tuning paradigm is computationally demanding, while the prompt in natural language is effective, interpretable and human-readable, especially practical for those limited by the computational budget. Previous works find prompt order [4], templates and examples can highly affect [5] the performance. \nThe field of prompt engineering has recently gained significant popularity, evolving into a highly sought-after career. Automating this process, and achieving superior performance compared to human-designed prompts, signifies a major step forward in the area of language model optimization. This motivates us to study the automated generation of high-quality prompts. \n\n* We understand your concern that prompt engineering might not be useful as the language model scales. However, it has not been proved that the larger the model is, the more robust it is to the given prompt. In our experiments, even GPT3.5 is sensitive to prompts. Lu et al. [4] demonstrate that models of different scales are sensitive to the prompt, with the largest LM being 175 billion. Meanwhile, our proposed EvoPrompt also achieves significant improvement on multiple tasks (e.g., up to 25% improvement on BBH compared with the famous Chain-of-Thought, which shows the influence of different prompts). Moreover, as the model's scale increases, the corresponding rise in computational cost renders fine-tuning methodologies less feasible. This shift amplifies the importance and relevance of prompts, known for their effectiveness and better interpretability.\n\n* One major benefit of employing LLMs as evolutionary operators is their ability to take into account the coherence within a sequence. Consequently, the prompt in natural language is a particularly appropriate application. We begin with NLP tasks because they come with standard objective evaluation criteria, which are more effective in showcasing the performance of EvoPrompt. As you mentioned, it would indeed be intriguing to apply EvoPrompt to multi-modality applications (e.g., game level and image generation) by adjusting the evaluation and selection strategies. \n\nSecondly, **ICLR considers a broad range of subject areas.** One contribution of our work is to connect LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, where, as you mentioned, the most innovative design is the LLM-based mutation/crossover operator. \nThis connection does not contribute to improving the evolutionary algorithms, instead, it sparks new applications for both of these fields. Accordingly, besides evolutionary algorithms, it is also highly related to LLMs. For example, the works considering evolutionary algorithms with reinforcement learning [2, 3]  were also accepted by ICLR\u201922 and ICLR\u201923. Another contribution is the prompt optimization framework. While our main focus is on prompts for NLP tasks, potential applications could also include prompts for vision tasks. This is in line with the \"applications in language and vision\" in the call for papers, as well as other previously accepted papers at ICLR'23 like APE [1].\n\nFinally, to address your **criticism regarding costs**, we analyze the cost to apply our EvoPrompt in general responses. Intuitively, there exists a trade-off between costs and the corresponding performance. EvoPrompt shows a higher ceiling compared with APE. Besides, EvoPrompt outperforms APE when keeping the same number of API requests. Please see the general response for more statistics. \n\n# References\n[1] Zhou, Yongchao, et al. \"Large Language Models are Human-Level Prompt Engineers.\"\u00a0*The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[2] Wang, Yutong, Ke Xue, and Chao Qian. \"Evolutionary diversity optimization with clustering-based selection for reinforcement learning.\"\u00a0*International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2022.\n\n[3] Hao, Jianye, et al. \"ERL-Re $^ 2$: Efficient Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Shared State Representation and Individual Policy Representation.\" *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[4] Lu, Yao, et al. \"Fantastically Ordered Prompts and Where to Find Them: Overcoming Few-Shot Prompt Order Sensitivity.\" Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). 2022.\n\n[5] Zhao, Zihao, et al. \"Calibrate before use: Improving few-shot performance of language models.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

Specific responses to each of your questions are as follows:\n\n* **Applications of our method**: In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of LLMs to implement evolutionary algorithms given clear instructions and mainly aim at prompt optimization. In addition, our framework can be applied to various fields, such as non-trivial NP-hard problems (e.g. TSP), and multi-modality scenarios. It also can be deployed on agent-based systems to enhance cooperation among agents in diverse situations. We leave this for future exploration\n* **QD methods**: Thanks for this insightful suggestion and for reminding us of the limitation of SA compared with EAs. QD methods like MAP-Elites are more recent and seek to find a set of policies with both high rewards and diverse behaviors. These approaches show a promising ability to balance exploitation and exploration, which is crucial for heuristic searches. We will further investigate this for future work.\n\nThank you again for your thoughtful feedback, and we hope our response has addressed your concerns adequately."

While the study showcases the ability to optimize prompts for language models like GPT-3.5 and Alpaca, this contribution doesn't significantly advance the state of the art, particularly given the use of well-known evolutionary operators of DE and GA. Designing prompts for language models, although important, might not meet the level of substantial novelty expected at a conference like ICLR. This approach, while showing performance enhancements, might not present a substantial leap forward in the field of language model optimization, especially considering the expectations of innovation and original contributions at such academic conferences. I think this paper would be better suited in a conference like IEEE CEC or PPSN."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer ZLDk,\n\nWe are grateful for your careful review and the valuable feedback that you provided for our paper. We would like to make the following clarifications about your concern. We also want to remind you that the discussion phase will end soon, so we would greatly appreciate your support in this regard before the deadline.\n\nFirstly, we would like to clarify the motivation and novelty of using the transitional evolutionary algorithms. The main novelty of this work is to propose a general framework that connects LLMs with evolutionary algorithms, as well as the LLM-based evolutionary operator design, which is also highlighted by all the other reviewers (LYv4, HRoN, hqfj). Furthermore, we believe that many traditional algorithms are still attractive due to their good performance, and connecting them with LLMs may encourage more innovative applications and not be limited to prompt optimization. Besides, many excellent works combine traditional well-performed algorithms with LLMs to get powerful methods. For instance, Self-Consistency [6] combines ensemble learning and LLMs (ICLR'23). [7] introduces effective beam search into reasoning paths (NeurIPS'23).\n\nSecondly, we appreciate your concern that our contribution doesn't significantly advance the state of the art. As shown in the experiments, EvoPrompt shows significant improvement on multiple tasks (e.g., up to 25% improvement on BBH compared with the famous Chain-of-Thought) and Reviewer LYv4, HRoN, hqfj find our experimental results convincing. \n\nFinally, we appreciate your concern regarding the novelty and appropriateness of prompt design for ICLR. \n\n* Prompts provide a necessary and efficient interface to interact with black-box LLMs. Previous works find prompt order [8], templates and examples can highly affect [9] the performance. The field of prompt engineering has recently gained significant popularity, evolving into a highly sought-after career. Automating this process, and achieving superior performance compared to human-designed prompts, is challenging and also signifies a major step forward in the area of language model optimization.\nwe have observed many good works related to prompts presented at previous ICLR, as well as other top conferences. For example, the famous Chain-of-Thought [1] has been accepted by NeurIPS'22. APE (one of our strong baselines [2]), GenRead [3], TEMPERA [4], least-to-most prompting [5] have been accepted by ICLR\u201923. Thus we believe that prompt design contributes to the advancement of the field and is in line with other previously accepted papers at ICLR'23.\n\n* On the other hand, the contribution of this work extends beyond prompt optimization. It also establishes a novel connection between evolutionary algorithms and LLMs. This framework can also be applied to various tasks, such as non-trivial NP-hard problems. Furthermore, we hope our work can inspire future research at the intersection of LLMs and traditional algorithms, encouraging innovative applications.\n\n# References\n[1] Wei, Jason, et al. \"Chain-of-thought prompting elicits reasoning in large language models.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*. 2022.\n\n[2] Zhou, Yongchao, et al. \"Large Language Models are Human-Level Prompt Engineers.\" *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[3] Yu, Wenhao, et al. \"Generate rather than Retrieve: Large Language Models are Strong Context Generators.\" *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[4] Zhang, Tianjun, et al. \"Tempera: Test-time prompt editing via reinforcement learning.\" *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[5] Zhou, Denny, et al. \"Least-to-most prompting enables complex reasoning in large language models.\" *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[6] Wang, Xuezhi, et al. \"Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models.\"  *The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2023.\n\n[7] Xie, Yuxi, et al. \"Decomposition enhances reasoning via self-evaluation guided decoding.\" *Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems*. 2023.\n\n[8] Lu, Yao, et al. \"Fantastically Ordered Prompts and Where to Find Them: Overcoming Few-Shot Prompt Order Sensitivity.\" Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). 2022.\n\n[9] Zhao, Zihao, et al. \"Calibrate before use: Improving few-shot performance of language models.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

                        "value": "Specific responses to each of your questions are as follows:\n- **The reason for choosing GA and DE**: We choose representative and widely used evolutionary algorithms, GA and DE for their fast convergence without any parameters. \nGA is among the most highly regarded evolutionary algorithms and DE has emerged as one of the most widely utilized algorithms for complex optimization challenges since its inception (first two paragraphs in Section 3). Apart from these two representative algorithms, other diverse algorithms can be further explored. \n- **Offspring generation strategy of DE**: Our original paper has carefully investigated different generation strategies of DE (analysis in Sec 5.2). In the main experiments, we choose one of them with the best performance.\n- **Repairing infeasible offspring and effect on time complexity**: For both GA and DE, after each iteration including selection, mutation and crossover, updating upon the current population, the infeasible offspring will be eliminated. The elimination is up to their fitness value, i.e., the performance on the given development set in our work. Eliminating infeasible offspring based on certain rules or a small subset of the development set, rather than evaluating them on the entire development set, could potentially reduce costs and leave them for future investigation."

If not, why?  \n\nAlso, given the inherently discrete nature of the prompt optimization problem, why didn't you try binary PSO or the ant colony optimization type algorithms? WIll not doing round-off for the solutions returned by inherently continuous operators of DE introduce more quantization noise?"
