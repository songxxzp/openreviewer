The product of NN weight matrices is taken as their causal adjacency matrix. Two regularizations are introduced to improve the quality of the extracted causal relationships: L1 regularization and a \u2018DAG loss\u2019 that ensures the resulting causal graph has no cyclic dependencies.\n\nAuthors propose an additional iterative retraining procedure to progressively improve confidence in learned causal relationships, by measuring agreement within an ensemble of models. \n\nFinally, an ensemble of CTP models is used to measure uncertainty with respect to possible treatment effects (e.g. due to unobserved confounding). These are retrained to maximize their difference in predicting treatment effects.\n\nThe model is studied on different simulated and real datasets."

See Q about graph directionality below.\n  * Are the small gains achieved by CTP on top of Linear ODE + L1 due to non-linearity or to the DAG loss term? NGM does not help answer this as it does not have the same L1 regularization.\n  * No numerical experiments measuring the quality of treatment effect bounds. I am surprised they are \"not very loose\", since they are maximized in training.\n  * Finally, I think a figure summarizing the many modeling elements would help the reader.\n\n* No discussion on interpretability, despite it being stated as one of the main motivations behind the paper.\n* No discussion of related works. I don't think this should be relegated to the appendix without even a mention in the main text.\n\n* The paper is often confusing and challenging to read. Issues include language, heavy/undefined notation. Some non-exhaustive examples:\n  * Paragraph after Eq.7. I would change the $k$ superscript there to another letter to avoid confusion with feature indices used above.  \n  * please carefully proofread language (\u201cOnce the constrained hold\u201d, \u201cproofed\u201d, \u201cadjacent matrix\u201d, \"casual\", etc.).\n  * First paragraph of the introduction could be improved and better connected to the actual content of the paper.\n  * Eq 11 has a tuple on the LHS and a single value on the RHS, as far as I understand. Could authors please clarify?\n  * See q's about Sec 2.4. below."

Could authors comment on this potential failure mode and what empirical bounds are then obtained in treatment effect prediction?\n\n* How expensive is the procedure of training multiple CTP models until convergence for causal identification, then again multiple converged models for TE bound estimation? Would this realistically be feasible in practice?\n\n* Is CTP robust to high-dimensional sources of confounding?\n\n* How is missing data (incl. the hidden confounder dimension) treated within the LSTM network?\n\n* What is the pattern for putting results in bold (not always best result)? Overlapping results should be treated in the same way. Same in your analysis: CTP does not obtain \u201cfirst place\u201d if results overlap.\n\n* Eq 8 (loss): would it ever make sense to weigh the contributions of different features differently? e.g. if they are measured at different frequencies?"

The experimental results suggest that the CTP model performs well in trajectory prediction, causal discovery, and treatment effect prediction, outperforming or at least matching existing models and, the model's scalability is demonstrated by its good performance in high-dimensional scenarios, such as the MM-25 and MM-50 datasets."

This raises concerns about the model's capability to model time-varying causal relationships. Did the authors assume that causal relationships remain constant over time? Otherwise, one might consider more advanced models that can capture changes in causality over time. \n\n- There is no clear theoretical analysis provided to ensure the correct identification of the causal graph with the proposed method from observational data.\n\n- The manuscript assumes the existence of unobserved confounding variables but does not provide further sensitivity analysis to quantitatively assess the impact of these variables on estimation uncertainty.\n\n- The evaluation of real-world data is limited, with only one dataset (ADNI) used, and a small sample size of 275. This raises questions about the model's generalizability and effectiveness in practical scenarios.\n\n- The predictive performance on the real-world dataset, as shown in Table 2, is suboptimal (AUC ~ 0.55, close to random guess). Given such results, how can the model perform well on the other two evaluation tasks, which are even more difficult than trajectory prediction?\n\n- The treatment settings are vague:\n    - The criteria for treatment selection in each dataset are not provided.\n    - The paper\u2019s claim that \"a treatment can be direct, dynamic, and continuous\" is not substantiated with examples from the datasets (i.e., only one variable at only one-time point as the treatment).\n    - The outcomes of interest and the confounding variables in each dataset are not specified.\n\n- While the paper claims that the model can aid in clinical decision-making, a concrete example or case study illustrating this application is needed.\n\n- The presentation of results could be improved for clarity. For instance, in Table 4, only the top-performing results should be highlighted in bold. Figure 2 requires clarification on what is meant by \"normalized value\" on the y-axis.

In the proposed model, it is unclear how it captures the hidden confounder, and no theoretical insights are given. \n- Eq. (6) needs more clarification. It is unclear about the dimensions of $W_1, ..., W_N$, how $C$ is obtained, why it is a vector, etc.\n- In Section 2.4, it is assumed \"all these parameters are located in a connected region.\" First, a \"connected region\" needs to be religiously defined as it can mean differently in different fields (e.g., optimization and graph theory); second, this assumption does not seem obvious. More illustration is expected about when and why this assumption holds.\n- When estimating the treatment effect, deconfounding methods are not used, but rather claims that \"estimates the feature trajectories and probable bounds under a treatment\". The exact meaning of this sentence is not very obvious to me. Since deconfounding has been widely deemed necessary, strong justification for not applying deconfounding would be expected with some grounded theoretical analysis.\n- Ablation study is not provided.\n- There are no theoretical insights provided about the identifiability and consistency of the developed method.\n- Minor type: \"There maybe infinite\" --> \"There may be infinite\" in the first paragraph in section 2.4.\n\n\n[1] Wang, Yixin, and David M.
