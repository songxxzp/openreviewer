Research into this topic is timely, highly relevant and important in the field.\n\nTheir framework generalizes existing work from Wood and Shawe-Taylor, and is tight in the sense that the characterization theorem enumerates all pairs of pointwise activation and linear layer that commute (and hence can be used in an equivariant network design). \n\nThe result for rotational equivariant architecture (that pointwise activation is equivariant iff representation of the linear layer is trivial) is surprising and may be crucial in opening up efforts to find other approaches to rotational equivariant architecture."

While I believe the paper is still self-contained, it may be beneficial for readers if the authors can expand on some intuition on the main theorems, maybe even in the appendix. \n\nRegarding the first point, we are currently enhancing the paper's readability and comprehension for a broader audience. In particular, we will incorporate examples and strengthen the appendices.\n\n> It doesn\u2019t look like the technique in this paper can generalize to infinite dimensional representation, which the author acknowledged in Page 4.  \n\nConcerning the issue of infinite-dimensional representations: these play a significant role in the current theoretical discourse on equivariant models and our framework does not cover this approach. We acknowledge that this is one of the main limitations of our work, and we will address the matter in the manuscript with more precision. It is however remarkable to note that, while the descriptive models employed generally involve infinite-dimensional representations and concepts of harmonic analysis, the final deployed model is essentially a discretization of their theoretical formulation. In certain instances [1, 2], these models maintain exact equivariance solely through finite-dimensional representations and finite groups, conditions addressed in our framework as mentioned on page 4, though perhaps too briefly.\n\n> Minor: I think the paper would also greatly benefit from a further discussion of \"what's next?\", what is the loss if we give up point-wise activations for rotational equivariant network but replacing them with other kinds of activation. \n\nTo address another problem raised by the reviewer, we will expand the conclusions. Despite the heterogeneous literature on non-pointwise activations, where each approach may vary for different tasks and little theoretical clarity exists, we will provide a more in-depth discussion.\n\n> For permutation-equivariant network, it may also be interesting to work out another nontrivial architecture that is neither DeepSets nor IGN (higher order tensor representation). I'd also understand if the authors deem these as being out-of-scope.\n\nRegarding the reviewer's last request, we can readily provide another example of a permutation-equivariant network that is not an IGN. For instance, considering the alternating group $A_n$ as the subgroup of even permutations in $S_n$, this subgroup cannot be isomorphic to any of the subgroups $S_\\lambda$ presented in the paper. The module $\\mathbb{R}^{S_n / A_n}$ will be a two-dimensional representation compatible with point-wise activations. Exploring such spaces, although they may seem pathological and of dubious practical utility, could aid in the understanding of permutation equivariance in its generality and hence in constructing better performing networks.\n\n**Response to questions:**\n\nWe thank the reviewer again for the help in improving the manuscript. We acknowledge the errors and inaccuracies and want to assure that we are already incorporating the suggested corrections.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Taco S.

The main result looks like a relatively simple add-on to the study of equivariant networks by Wood & Shawe-Taylor (1996). Most results found in the appendix are either simple facts from the group and representation theory or are borrowed from Wood & Shawe-Taylor (1996) (e.g., the key equivariance condition (3)). Theorem 1 seems to be a relatively simple consequence of these results.    \n\n2. Though the paper includes a discussion of applications of Theorem 1 in Sections 5 and 6, I found these sections not easy to follow. They essentially consist of a long and not so well structured list of comments surrounding a few corollaries. The context of these comments is explained relatively vaguely, partly through references to other papers. It is not really clear to me why any of these corollaries and comments is actually important. The paper does not include specific examples, illustrations or experiments showing how Theorem 1 can, say, help improve designs of equivariant models. \n\n**Writing.** The writing is sloppy in several places, with typos and unclear grammar. For example, only in Lemma 5:\n- the index $i$ seems to be missing in the definition of $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathcal M)$; \n- the indices and coefficients are wrong in the formula for $f(\\sum_{j\\in S}M_{rj}x)$; \n- a word seems to be missing in \"It is a simple to check\".\n\nI could understand the proof of Lemma 5 only with some effort (especially the sentence \" And obviously each..\"). The sentence \"Hence, we can restrict our classification..\" after the proof of Lemma 7 seems to consist of two different statements, but it is unclear where the first one ends and the second begins. In Lemma 7: \"dived into three different type\"."

Note that two isomorphic representations are equivalent in terms of learning capabilities and this aspect was not covered by the original paper. Indeed, we solve an issue raised in Section 4.2 of Wood and Shawe-Taylor where they provide an example of a positive monomial representation that is not a permutation representation. That representation is actually isomorphic to a permutation representation. With our approach we fix all issues like this in a *general* and *complete* setting. \n* We integrate the theory developed by Wood and Shawe-Taylor with several adjustments that make the classification effective. For example, our Lemma 1 ensures the maximality of the families of matrices and activations presented. This aspect is not discussed by Wood and Shawe-Taylor, and it is necessary for the rigor of the characterization. \n* We want to highlight that despite acknowledging the authorship of some technical lemmas presented at the end of the appendices to Wood and Shawe-Taylor, our proposed proofs place a greater emphasis on algebraic aspects, especially grounding our characterization on the classification of multiplicative subgroups of $\\mathbb{R}$, diverging by Wood and Shawe-Taylor. This approach not only improves the readability of the proof but also highlights the potential to generalize these results to complex numbers as a plausible solution to certain limitations of real equivariant networks as suggested in the Conclusions.\n\nIn the manuscript that we will upload, we will further update and refine these proofs. When compared to the original ones, they will show their kinship, but also their novelty.\nWe believe that the impact and implications of these innovations are significant for the machine learning community, especially considering the evolution and growth of the use and study of equivariant representation learning during the twenty years passed since the publication of Wood and Shawe-Taylor's paper. \n\n2.\n> Though the paper includes a discussion...\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the difficulty in understanding the focus and significance of Sections 5 and 6. We intend to refine these sections in the updated version of the manuscript to enhance comprehension. This will involve introducing fundamental concepts essential for understanding, along with the inclusion of simple examples. In instances where space constraints may limit these improvements, we will ensure to adequately strengthen the appendices and incorporate appropriate references in the main text. The reviewer rightfully questions how our proposed results may influence the design of equivariant models. We indirectly address this concern by highlighting how our findings show gaps in understanding specific phenomena. For instance, in Section 5.2, we present a list of permutation-equivariant neural networks which, to the best of our knowledge, are not found in the existing literature. The existence of these networks show an inadequate understanding of the permutation equivariance, a gap stemming from the scarcity of theoretical results in the field. In the long term, addressing this gap appropriately may lead to the development of new, more efficient, and better-performing models. With this work, we aim to contribute to this endeavor.\n\n**Response to writing:**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for their comments, particularly appreciating the precision of their remarks. We acknowledge the errors identified in Lemma 5 and will promptly rectify them in the manuscript. We will also revise the proof of Lemma 1 to enhance its clarity. Furthermore, we acknowledge and will rectify the errors and ambiguities noted in Lemma 7.\n\n**Response to questions:**\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we are committed to enhancing the readability of the paper by improving the quality of writing and incorporating illustrative examples. Regarding the suggestion to focus on fewer applications but delve into them more thoroughly, we acknowledge this as a viable and effective approach. Secondly, maintaining a comprehensive overview of all applications is essential to convey the significance and ubiquity of the implications of Theorem 1 within the entire research field of geometric deep learning.\n\n**References:**\n[1] Wood and Shawe-Taylor.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough comments. \n\n**Response to weaknesses:**\n\n**Readability:**\n> 1. I find this paper quite difficult to read at times, and I think that it would benefit from more explicitly defining certain concepts and writing out certain arguments. In the proof of Corollary 3, I do not quite understand the application of Theorem 1; why does the representation have to be trivial? Also, Section 6.2 about invariant graph networks is very dense. See also questions.\n\nAs suggested, we will provide more explicit definitions of concepts and arguments. In particular, we will modify the proof of Corollary 3 to emphasize how it derives from Theorem 1 and how those representations are trivial. Subsequently, we will proceed to clarify and expand Section 6.2.\n\n**Applicability to equivariant ML:** \n> 2. The applicability of these results to empirical equivariant machine learning is unclear.\n\nThis theorem may be of interest even to the ordinary machine learning practitioner as it provides the complete list of cases where the application of point-wise activations is viable and those can generally lead to increased computational efficiency. \n\n**Result on SO(3):** \n> Already practitioners do not use pointwise nonlinearities for $SO(3)$-equivariant networks.\n\nWe agree that many different approaches to non-pointwise activations for equivariant $SO(3)$-equivariant networks are employed in practice but they in general require more computational resources, present a slow convergence rate, or both. For this reason, it may be favorable to employ pointwise activation to mitigate those shortcomings, but we prove in the paper that this is not a viable option.\nIndeed, we believe that this result is of greater significance for machine learning researchers aiming to construct new equivariant models. In fact, in some relevant cases (e.g. exact rotation equivariance), this theorem suggests that natural research directions (e.g., pointwise activations coupled with any $SO(3)$-representation) might require more careful thinking.\n\n**Implication for IGN:** \n> Also, are there any expectations of potential benefits from using other representations of $S_n$ for invariant graph networks?\n\nRegarding the list of other presented $S_n$-equivariant models, we have no strong results about their general properties. We deemed it significant to highlight their existence not only for sake of completeness but also because this manifests a lack of understanding of the broader concept of permutation equivariance, a deficiency arising from a scarcity of theoretical work in the field, a lacuna that, if strongly addressed, could lead to the construction of more efficient and expressive models. With this work, we hope to contribute positively to the long-term effort of filling this gap.\n\n**Response to questions:**\n> 1. In Section 6.1 / Section 6.3, why is the following case ruled out? Say I let $f$ be linear, so that\n$\\tilde f$ is just scaling and is hence equivariant to $SO(3)$. Then the output representation is the same as the input, and is in particular not invariant. This can be done in the $SO(3) \n\\times S_n$ case as well.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for catching our oversight formulating Corollary 3; indeed, an hypothesis was missing from the statement and the statement holds true only for nonlinear activations which rules out the provided example.\n\n**Typos:**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer for pointing out these typos. The corrections will be promptly incorporated into the manuscript."

However, I believe that in order for it to be of practical value the paper should be more accessible to a broader audience. Although formal and precise, there is little effort put in describing the main results in plain English.\n2. Although partially covered by clarifying the scope of the paper, I do think the notion of regular representations is insufficiently covered. By sticking to irreducible representations one naturally comes to the conclusion that if one wants to apply point-wise activations one has to use trivial (invariant) irreps. However, if one admits regular representations (either approximations in the full SO(n) case, or exact as in the discrete sub-group cases of SO(n)) then one is not limited to invariants as the regular representations are effectively permutation representations. The regular representations can also be defined in the continuous setting, though the discretization may introduce some equivariance error, however, this need not be a problem as one could use random grids to avoid such biases. See e.g. Kuipers-Bekkers-2023:\n\nKuipers, T.P., Bekkers, E.J. (2023). Regular SE(3) Group Convolutions for Volumetric Medical Image Analysis. In: Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention \u2013 MICCAI 2023. LNCS, vol 14222. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-43898-1_25\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13960\n\nAs for equivariant models with point-wise activation functions, it is often the case that internally the models use (non-trivial) irreps to parametrize the layers, and use an inverse Fourier transform to transform back to the regular representation basis, apply point-wise activation, then project back to irrep basis. I think including such approach in the discussions enable more people to relate to the result of the paper. Although commonly used in practice, I did find it hard to find references to such approaches. See e.g. the library e3nn ( https://docs.e3nn.org/en/latest/api/nn/nn_s2act.html ) and escnn (https://quva-lab.github.io/escnn/api/escnn.nn.html?highlight=fourier#escnn.nn.FourierPointwise). As for papers I could find [Cesa et al. 2021] Appendix H.2:\n\nCesa, G., Lang, L., & Weiler, M. (2021, October). A program to build E (N)-equivariant steerable CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nand perhaps the following as it represents signals on a grid but performs convs in the Fourier domain\n\nCohen, T. S., Geiger, M., K\u00f6hler, J., & Welling, M. (2018, February). Spherical CNNs. In International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\n3. By the previous item, remarks such as (see abstract) \"we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant\" is in practice more nuanced, and I consider the statement actually incorrect. Another example of a rotation equivariant method based on equivariantly obtained spherical grids (they call it equivariant mesh) is GemNet:\n\nGasteiger, J., Becker, F., & G\u00fcnnemann, S. (2021). Gemnet: Universal directional graph neural networks for molecules. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34, 6790-6802.\n\nEffectively, the paper works with scalar fields over the homogeneous space $\\mathbb{R}^3 \\times S^2$, as also discussed in recent work https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02970 , which also fully operates in the domain of regular representations. I remark that this reference seem to have appeared only after the ICLR deadline so of course I do not expect this to have been included.\n\n4. In conclusion, I think the paper could improve on impact if the relation to regular group convolution methods is further clarified and if the main results are introduced in simpler terms. The claim that equivariant networks can only be invariant is I think an artifact of the choice of sticking to irreducible representations.\n\nThank you for the great work and for considering my comments. I'm open to discussing my comments as I could have surely misinterpreted some parts of the paper."

The paper is a theoretical contribution and emphasizes that the results are of practical value. [...]\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of improving the paper's accessibility and readability. In our revisions, we ensure to present the main results in a more straightforward manner to enhance clarity for a broader audience.\n\n2. **Regular representations and Irreps:** \n\n> 2. Although partially covered by clarifying the scope of the paper, I do think the notion of regular representations is insufficiently covered. [...]\n\nIf we correctly understand the concerns regarding regular representations and irreps, we suppose that there may be confusion due to the adoption of Wood and Taylor's notation for regular representations. We will explicitly clarify in the manuscript that despite this notation choice, our results address arbitrary finite-dimensional representations, which encompass regular and, more in general, permutation representations. Additionally, we will emphasize that the specific treatment of disentangled representations (hence the introduction of irreps) is confined to Section 5.2 and does not affect other parts of the paper. The invariance result for compact connected topological groups (e.g. $SO(3)$) is not implied by disentanglement but it follows from the finiteness of the matrix groups underlying admissible representations. Indeed, note that hypotheses of Corollary 3 do not require disentanglement. For further clarification, the last paragraph in Section 6.3 exploits the existence of decomposition in irreducible components and Schur's Lemma only to prove triviality, but it does not require disentanglement of the layer, meaning that the basis chosen in the definition of the pointwise activation (see Section 3.2) does not need to agree with some irrep decomposition (see the first paragraph of Section 5.2). Note that irrep decompositions exist for each representation, regular ones too, (see Appendix A.2, Theorem 2) the stringent constraint is disentanglement that we are not assuming in this instance.\n\n3. **Discretization:**\n\n> 3. By the previous item, remarks such as (see abstract) \"we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant\" is in practice more nuanced, and I consider the statement actually incorrect. [...]\n\nIn agreement with the reviewer, we acknowledge the necessity for a broader contextualization of Theorem 1 within the current literature covering all nuanced takes on equivariance. For brevity in this comment, we categorize these nuances as approximate equivariance compared to exact equivariance, and finite-dimensional frameworks compared to harmonic analysis approaches. Adopting this simplified view, our restriction to  exact equivariance and finite-dimensional representations should be pointed out earlier and more clearly in the text, highlighting how the analysis conducted under these constraints also affects practices derived from harmonic analysis approaches. We proceed to elaborate on the matter in greater detail:\nWe agree, as pointed out by the reviewer, that a substantial portion of the current literature on equivariant models relies on harmonic analysis approaches [1, 2, 4]. Processed inputs are continuous finite-energy signals defined on homogeneous spaces (e.g., $L^2(G)$ functions) which are infinite-dimensional spaces and thus fall outside the scope of our study.\nHowever, as pointed out at page 4 of the paper, in practice continuous models are often discretized, relaxing the equivariance condition to an approximate notion. This process is often obtained by truncating finite Fourier transforms of the signal or discretizing the symmetry group and domain. This discretization frequently boils down to considering equivariant models with finite-dimensional representations of finite groups [5, 8], which is dealt with by our framework and, in line with our findings, allow pointwise activations and non-trivial representations.\nContrary to our approach, other methods suggested by the reviewer (such as GemNet [3]) employ tools akin to Tensor Field Networks [7], featuring non-pointwise activations that, as implied by the paper's title, go beyond the scope of our work (utilizing tensor representations, a nonlinear function, formula 4 in Dym and Maron [7]).\nThese are however very interesting directions that we will address as future research.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** \n\n> 4. In conclusion, I think the paper could improve on impact if the relation to regular group convolution methods is further clarified and if the main results are introduced in simpler terms. [...]\n\nWe agree, and in light of the observations made, we will incorporate your suggestions and compare our work to the proposed references to enhance the overall impact and clarity of the paper."

The paper is sound and overall accessible.\n\nMy worry about the claim of practical usefulness remains. I am afraid that stating things like \"we prove that rotation-equivariant networks can only be invariant\" will only hamper practical usefulness (/impact) as in no one would be interested in neural networks that are strictly invariant. I very much appreciate our discussion above, however I did not see how this discussion will be incorporated in the revision, and thus cannot justify an increase in my score and maintain it at 6. \n\nFinally a small note, GemNet [3] does use point-wise activation functions. It is based on invariant message passing, but effectively on the homogeneous space of positions and orientations (as messages are send between edges), see [4]. The precise group convolutional viewpoint in that paper is obscured, but it is an instance of an exactly equivariant neural network, which utilizes point-wise non-linearities. It achieves exact equivariance through the construction of \"equivariant meshes\". The paper is of a different kind than TFNs (I understand the confusion, but only uses part of the theory for proving universal approximation power [7], and only uses spherical harmonics for embedding the invariants, it is not based on clebsch-gordan tensor products otherwise).\n\nThus, the claim of invariance is technically sound from the disentangled representation (steerable/irrep) viewpoint, but I think the nuance and context as raised in our discussions are very important."
