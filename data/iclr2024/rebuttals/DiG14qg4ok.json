However, the flexibility of learning new tasks in a long task sequence is constrained due to the orthogonal projection mechanism of GPM. To address this issue, this paper proposes to optimize on oblique manifold to relax the orthogonal projection constraint. Specifically, the proposed method minimizes the cost function that involves both inter-task and intra-task coherence. The paper also provides some theoretical analysis to support the idea. Extensive experiments on several standard CL benchmarks show the improvement of the LcSP compared to GPM and other related methods."

Further, another alternative solution is to assign different weights to the bases so that new tasks can learn more effectively, as proposed by [2].  These similar works diminish the novelty of this work.\n\n* Optimization in oblique manifold is a well-studied technique in existing literature. Thus, the technical contribution of this paper is weak. \n\n* The authors state that their method can be applied to class-incremental learning.

The accuracy of TRGP is slightly larger than the proposed method, but the proposed method is more efficient than TRGP. Figs. 1 and 2 show the superiority of the proposed method clearly.\n- This paper attempts to guarantee the performance theoretically.

I think that this paper presents an interesting idea, but careful writing of the article is a minimum requirement for acceptance so that readers do not misunderstand.\n- Writings of theoretical results are a bit odd. Lemma 1 seems to define the condition (eq. (15)) when models overcome catastrophic forgetting, but in afterward proof, the paper proves that the proposed method satisfies the condition. I think that definition is separated from Lemma 1 and Lemma 1 should be finished like that \"models trained by LcSP satisfy eq. (15)\".\nThe second proof does not have a theoretical claim, and it is difficult to grasp what result is proved by this proof.\nAdditionally, I suggest you to add intuitive explanation of theoretical results after each claim.\nPlease note that I am not an expert in this area. So, plasticity and stability might be well known in this area, and these results may not require additional explanations for experts.\nEven so, I think this paper should show the definition of stability and plasticity or citation that presents these concepts before Method Analysis.\n- This paper may have been written in haste and contains many typographical errors. For examples, Singular value decomposition is written as \"Single\" Value Decomposition.\nThis paper uses wrong table number in Section of Experiments: Table 3 is referred in the main paper but it is the table in appendix.\nMany careless errors undermine the reliability of this paper: It is difficult to believe that an experiment is being performed without error or bugs when there are so many errors in writing of the paper.\n- Several papers in Reference lack the title of journal or conference."

As a relaxation of the orthogonal subspace, it is unclear how well the low-coherence subspace-based method can perform on handling the forgetting issue, in priciples. The limits and assumptions behind the proposed method are not clearly analyzed and discussed. \n\n- The developed method (with task-specific projection) and experiments are limited to only the task-incremental continental learning, where the task identifiers are required in both training and testing. Although the authors mention an algorithm to apply the low-coherence subspace modeling with other methods to handle other CL settings, they seem not implemented and validated in the experiments.
