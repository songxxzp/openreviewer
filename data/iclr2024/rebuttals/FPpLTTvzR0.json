                        "value": "Dear Reviewer P55P,\n\nThank you for recognizing the strengths of our work, including our interesting motivation, interesting approach, good representation, and great experimentation. We appreciate the opportunity to provide a detailed response to the weaknesses and questions you have highlighted.\n\n**Q1:** Minor language issues throughout the paper\n\n**A1:** We have thoroughly revised the paper to ensure that the language is clear, precise, and adheres to high academic standards. For ease of identification, all modifications have been highlighted in blue in the revised version of our paper. \n\n**Q2:** It is not clear why the end result of the encoder H would be a causal feature. I can see how the learned representation could be a feature set that is invariant to the features the attack but making a causal claim is not completely justified.\n\n**A2:** We appreciate your recognition that the learned representation is invariant to attacks. We would like to offer further clarification on our use of the term \"causal feature.\" This terminology is specifically chosen to denote features that maintain a direct and invariant causal relationship with the labels, as supported by the principles found in the invariant causal learning literature [1,2,3,4]. For instance, the concept of Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) posits that invariance is a defining characteristic of causal relationships [1].\n\nIn our initial paper, detailed in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2.1, we delineate our intention to identify features that hold a causal influence over the labels. By examining causal relationships and conditional independencies, we have developed the predictive and invariant goals. These goals are designed to steer the encoder $h$ towards learning these causal features, as further elaborated in Section 3.2.2.\n\nWe trust that this elaboration dispels any ambiguity surrounding our use of the term \"causal\".\n\n**Q3:** It is unclear how the method generalises to multiple unseen attacks.\n\n**A3:** As stated in Section 3.2, our IDEA aims to learn the causal features that determine labels, having strong and invariant predictability across different attack domains, rather than spurious relationships that are limited to a single domain. As stated in Section 3.2.1, the element vulnerable to the attack, denoted as $G$ (since the attack propagates from attack domain $D$ to perturbation $T$ and subsequently to ego-network $G$), exhibits certain characteristics; specifically, the conditional mutual information $I(D,Y|G)$, is substantially high, because collider. Our invariance goal is to minimize the conditional mutual information $I(D,Y|Z)$, avoiding $Z$ learning the part affected by the attack. Meanwhile, our component of domain learner aids in proving IDEA achieving adversarial robustness across all attack domains, as proved in Proposition 2. \n\nIn addition to theoretical guarantees, experimental results further demonstrate that the IDEA is robust to attacks that do not appear in the training set, thereby confirming the effectiveness and generalization of our method against unseen attacks, and this strength is also identified by Reviewer jN54.\n\nIn conclusion, we greatly appreciate your recognition of our method and experimentation. We observe that your concerns are mainly regarding the conception, which has been stated in our initial paper. We have provided further clarification to address each concern. We hope you can reconsider your assessment and potentially improve the overall assessment based on our clarification. We believe that our work offers valuable insights and advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial graph machine learning, making a meaningful contribution to the research community. We appreciate your valuable feedback, and we look forward to any further comments or questions you may have.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer jN54,\n\nThank you for recognizing the strengths of our paper, including the comprehensive theoretical basis, the novelty of perspective, as well as the effectiveness and generalization of our method as demonstrated by our experiments. Regarding the weaknesses you have identified, we provided explanations and supplemented them where appropriate in the paper, as follows:\n\n**Q1:** The table only shows the excellence of this method when facing one of poisoning attacks or evasion attacks.\n\n**A1:**  We would like to clarify that there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the scope of the attacks tested. In fact, our IDEA has been rigorously tested against four evasion attacks. These include the graph modification attack Nettack and node injection attacks including PGD, TDGIA, and G-NIA. In addition to evasion attacks, we have also employed the widely acknowledged metattack for poisoning scenarios, testing it across different perturbation rates. This approach is a standard in defense-related research, as evidenced by its extensive use in prior studies [1,2,3,4]. The results in our initial submission broadly cover various types of attacks, including untargeted (MetaAttack) and targeted (nettack, PGD, TDGIA, and G-NIA) attacks, graph modification attacks (nettack and MetaAttack) and node injection attacks (PGD, TDGIA, and G-NIA), as well as white-box attacks (adaptive attack in Table 4) and gray-box (MetaAttack, nettack, PGD, TDGIA, and G-NIA) attacks. These have been stated in \u201cimplementation\u201d in Section 4 in our initial submission.\n\n**Q2:** The symbols seem unclear.\n\n**A2:** We appreciate your valuable feedback. To address this, we have revised the manuscript to include Table 5 that summarizes all symbols and their definitions for quick reference in Appendix E. We believe this can make the paper more reader-friendly and help to ensure that the symbols are clear and well-understood.\n\n**Q3:** The drawing of overall block diagram of the method.\n\n**A3:** Thank you for your constructive feedback. In response, we have further improved Figure 3, which illustrates the overall architecture, enhancing its layout and alignment. Please refer to the updated paper for a detailed view.  Furthermore, we have appended a description to Figure 3, aiming to augment its clarity and facilitate better understanding for the readers. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.\n\n**Q4:** Can purification methods in CV extend to graph purification? \n\n**A4:** We read the computer vision purification literature you recommended [5, 6, 7, 8] and observed that they often leverage image data priors. For example, paper [5] incorporates self-supervised tasks such as image rotation that are unique to the domain of computer vision, while paper [8] depends on a pixel loss function, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}_{img}$, to encourage image smoothness. These domain-specific dependencies pose significant challenges when considering the direct transposition of these methods to graph data, which inherently lacks such image-based priors.\n\nIn contrast, graph purification methods are specifically designed to exploit the unique structural and feature-related properties of graph data, making them appropriate for addressing graph-specific issues. However, graph purification defenses rely on heuristic assumptions, as detailed in our initial submission. Experimental results demonstrate that our method IDEA outperforms these existing methods when defending against attacks.\n\n In our revised paper, we have added a separate subsection Appendix A.4 discussing these purification methods in the computer vision field [5, 6, 7, 8]. We believe this extended discussion will provide our readers with a more holistic understanding of the challenges and potential of purification methods across various fields.\n\nIn conclusion, we are encouraged by your recognition on our novelty and effectiveness. To address your concerns, we have implemented clarifications and revisions. These include the addition of a symbol table for quick reference, the refinement of Figure 3 for enhanced clarity, and the inclusion of a new subsection, Appendix A.4, which expands on related work and discussion. We trust that these updates will provide a clearer understanding of our work. We kindly request that you re-evaluate our submission in light of these modifications. We believe that our work offers valuable insights and advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial graph machine learning, making a meaningful contribution to the research community. We are grateful for your constructive feedback and are open to any additional comments or inquiries you may have. Thank you for your consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe authors"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer 6toz,\n\nThank you for recognizing the strengths of our sound method and complete theoretical derivations. We understand your concerns and would like to address them as follows:\n\n**Q1:** The expired link of code.\n\n**A1:** We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by the expired link. The issue has been resolved, and the repository is now available at the updated link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IDEA_repo-666B. We have ensured that this repository contains all the necessary code, datasets, and hyperparameters for comprehensive validation of our empirical results. Additionally, we submitted all these resources in the \"Supplementary Material\" on our initial submission on the OpenReview website, for complete transparency and ease of reproducibility. We trust that the updated link and these resources can address any concerns regarding the validation of our work.\n\n**Q2:** The claim that causality directly contributes to improved defense performance is weak, as opposed to algorithmic superiority.\n\n**A2:** We respectfully disagree with this assertion. In our paper, we have not claimed that \"causality directly contributes to improved defense performance\". But, the causality is important, since the goals of IDEA are obtained based on the causality. We have explained the relationship between the causality and IDEA\u2019s goal in Section 3.2.1 in our initial submission. Here, we provide the summary:\n\n- Predictive goal $\\max_{\\Phi} I\\left(\\Phi(G), Y\\right)$ is according to causality $C_i \\rightarrow Y_i$.\n- Node-based Invariance goal $\\min_{\\Phi}  I\\left(Y, D \\mid \\Phi(G)\\right)$ is derived by comparing the conditional independences $ Y_i \n\\not\\negthickspace \\perp \\negthickspace\\negthickspace \\perp D_i \\mid G_i$ and $Y_i \\perp \\negthickspace\\negthickspace \\perp D_i \\mid C_i$, which are based on causalities in Figure 2.\n- Structural-based Invariance goal $\\min_{\\Phi}  I\\left(Y, D \\mid \\Phi(G)\\_\\mathcal{N}\\right)$ is derived by comparing $Y_{i} \\not\\negthickspace \\perp \\negthickspace\\negthickspace \\perp D_{i} \\mid G_{k}$ and $Y_{i} \\perp \\negthickspace\\negthickspace \\perp D_{i} \\mid C_{k}$, which are based on causalities in Figures 2.\n\n**Q3:** What's the significance of Figure 1 (b)? Aren't there inherent learning capability differences between different GNN architectures?\n\n**A3:** The purpose of this figure is to demonstrate how various assumptions influence clean performance, as stated in our initial Section 1. Note that the basic architecture (such as the hidden layer dimensions and a number of hidden layers) of defense methods (such as ProGNN, STABLE, and SimpGCN) are consistent with GCN, to ensure the comparison is fair.\n\nDespite their architectural similarities, we observe a notable degradation in the performance of ProGNN, STABLE, and SimpGCN when they process clean graphs. This observation is critical as it highlights the limitations of these models. For example, ProGNN aims to counteract adversarial attacks by modifying the graph structure; however, when applied to clean graphs, this strategy may inadvertently remove legitimate edges, thereby impairing the model's performance.\n\nIn essence, Figure 1(b) shows the influence of these heuristic priors on clean performance, highlighting the limitation of existing methods.\n\n We observe that some of your concerns come from some misunderstanding which has been stated in our initial paper. We have provided further clarification to address each concern and updated the repository to strengthen the validation of our paper's claims. We hope you can reconsider your assessment and potentially improve the overall assessment. We believe that our work offers valuable insights and advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial graph machine learning, making a meaningful contribution to the research community. We appreciate your valuable feedback, and we look forward to any further comments or questions you may have. Thank you for your consideration.\n\nBest regards,\n\nThe authors"

Specifically, it first defines a causal graph that some casual feature would have strong predictability for the label and maintains invariant predictability across attack domains so that perturbing the features adversarially won't induce a successful attack. It then defines a objective by defining different mutual information to learn the casual features. The experiments show the proposed method could achieve a significant improvement over current defenses."

The threat model is actually unclear. The proposed method actually built a detector neural network in the defense. The attacks tested seems have no knowledge about the detector network. Therefore, the improvement might be brought by the attacker's incapability acquiring enough model information. Also,   it is unfair to compare with other proposed methods since they are only modifying the provided model or aggression rule. A adaptive attack  or white box attack should assume the attacker has already known the added detection neural networks.\n3. There are some notations and figures problems that causes the paper not easy to follow. \nNode j in Figure 2 should be Node k.  Z in Section 3.2.1 is not defined.  (.)_\\cN is never defined.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer knCN,\n\nThank you for acknowledging our new perspective and the significant improvement of our method on experiments. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the points you have raised and hope the following responses will enhance your understanding of our work.\n\n**Q1:** Since I am not expert in causal inference, it is unclear to me how the initial casual graph is defined. \n\n**A1:** Thank you for your question. Our interaction causal model is grounded in the well-established understanding in the field of invariant causal learning [1,2,3] and our analysis of graph adversarial attacks. We have elucidated the explanation of each causal relationship in Section 3.1, and provide a summary below:\n\n1. The causal feature $C$ determines the input ego-network $G$ and label $Y$. According to the literature [1,2,3], the causes of input data generation are divided into two categories for simplicity. (i) The causes that causally determine the label are called causal feature $C$, leading to the causal relationships $C \\rightarrow Y$ and $C \\rightarrow G$. For example, in credit scoring, $C$ represents the financial situation, which determines both $G$ (including personal attributes and friendships) and credit score $Y$. (ii) The causes that do not influence labels are called non-causal features $N$. These are recognized in the causal invariant field [1,2,3].\n2. In the graph adversarial field, the attack domain $D$ influences the perturbation $T$, and the perturbation $T$ influences the input ego-network $G$. We summarize $D$ and $T$ as the non-causal features $N$.\n3. Particularly, in graph data, due to the interconnectedness of nodes, we introduce the interaction causal model to capture this non-IID characteristic. The causal feature $C_i$ and perturbation $T_i$ of a node $i$ affect its neighbor $G_k$, which is also consistent with the GNN literature [4,5].\n\n**Q2:** The knowledge of the threat model and \u201cdetector network\u201d\n\n**A2:** We would like to address the misunderstandings regarding the threat model and our method:\n\n- **We have provided adaptive attack results**: In our initial submission, we have indeed included the evaluation against white-box adaptive attacks [9], as detailed in Appendix D.4 titled \"Performance under adaptive attacks\". Here, the adaptive attacker is fully aware of all the information of defense methods, including the architecture, parameters, as well as input and output data. As presented in Table 4, the results demonstrate that while adaptive attacks significantly challenge defense methods, our proposed method IDEA maintains superior performance over all baseline methods. This rigorously tests IDEA's robustness in scenarios where the attacker has complete knowledge of the defense strategy.\n- **Details on the threat model are in Section 4**: We have provided the information of the attack in the \"Implementation\" in Section 4 of our initial paper, found on page 7. \"Implementation\" outlines the attack phase (evasion/poisoning), target nodes, and knowledge of the attacker.\n- **Misunderstanding of our method**: We would like to rectify a misunderstanding regarding our proposed method. IDEA does not employ a separate 'detector network' as part of its defense strategy. Instead, it focuses on learning causal features through the optimization of node-based and structure-based invariance losses that we have proposed. This approach is fundamentally different from detection-based defenses and is integral to the novelty of our contribution.\n- **Fair comparison**: We assure you that all comparative evaluations have been conducted under the same conditions. Both IDEA and the baseline methods are provided with the same level of information regarding the attacks they are tested against. This ensures that the comparisons are fair and the improvements observed with IDEA are attributable to its inherent robustness and effectiveness.\n\n**Q3:** Notation and figure issues\n\n**A3:** We apologize for any confusion stemming from inaccuracies in notations and figures previously presented. In the updated version of the paper,\n\n- Node $j$ in Figure 2 is now corrected as node $k$.\n- The notation $Z$ in Section 3.2.1 has been updated to $\\Phi(G)$ for clarity.\n- The symbol $\\mathcal{N}$, denoting neighbors, has been clarified.\n\nThere are also some misunderstandings about our paper in the review comments:\n- Framework introduction: In our initial submission, we have provided the introduction of the framework in the 3.2.4 \u201cOverall Framework\u201d on page 6.\n- Figure 5 viewing issue: This issue may be attributed to browser-specific rendering limitations. We kindly recommend downloading the PDF version of our paper and viewing it with a PDF reader for accurate display.\n\nWe have meticulously revised the entire document to prevent any such errors in the paper. For ease of identification, all modifications have been highlighted in blue in the revised version of our paper."

This is consistent with the existing causal invariance literature [1,2,3].\n\n**Q5:** If the attacker knew the added neural network, would the proposed method still achieve a similar improvement in the paper?\n\n**A5:** We have already conducted the white-box adaptive attack [9] experiments, and exported the results in Appendix D.4 \u201cPerformance under adaptive attacks\u201d. As shown in Table 4, adaptive attacks make serious performance degradation to defense methods because they are powerful white-box attacks. IDEA outperforms all the baselines. The results offer a broader evaluation of IDEA\u2019s performance under a hard scenario, consistently showing IDEA\u2019s superiority.\n\nWe observe that there are quite a lot of misunderstandings on our paper and most of them have been stated in our initial submission. We have provided further clarification to address each concern. We hope you can reconsider your assessment and potentially improve the overall assessment based on our clarification. We believe that our work offers valuable insights and advances the state-of-the-art in adversarial graph machine learning, making a meaningful contribution to the research community. We are available for any further clarifications you may require.
