The quantum embeddings are generated by evolving the quantum system govern by the Hamiltonian which is parametrized by the graph structure. The paper also presents theoretical evidence to support that the quantum embeddings could distinguish some graphs that cannot be distinguished by the classical method (GD-WL test with RRWP embedding). The numerical experiments demonstrate that quantum embeddings can enhance state-of-the-art graph transformers on real-world and synthetic graph datasets."

It introduces a framework for mapping graphs to quantum states and extracting quantum features such as correlations and probabilities from quantum dynamics.\n\n2. Compared to the extensive prior work in quantum graph machine learning, the theory proposed in this paper is interesting. It shows that some quantum features are theoretically more expressive than classical ones, such as random walk probabilities, for certain classes of graphs.\n\n3. It demonstrates that quantum features can enhance state-of-the-art graph transformers on standard benchmarks (though the gain is small), as well as on synthetic datasets that are hard for classical models."

                    "value": "1. From my point of view, in the literature of quantum graph learning, it is not particular novel to obtain the node/graph embeddings by encoding the graph structure into the Hamiltonian of the quantum system. Many previous papers have done a lot of research [1,2,3,4].  \nThe authors need to provide a thorough and comprehensive summary of the existing relevant work in quantum graph learning.\n\n2. The reviewer does not clearly see or understand where the main contributions of this paper lie in comparison to these highly relevant existing literature listed above. The reviewer believes that the research contributions of this paper is relatively insufficient, and the authors primarily transferred existing results to a new context, including some minor improvements, such as incorporating quantum embeddings into attention mechanisms. \n\n3. The reviewer acknowledges that the numerical experiments reported in this paper are not particularly exciting. Most of the experimental results do not show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art models especially for real-world benchmarks, or they only show marginal improvements. \n\n4. It should be noted that there are some errors w.r.t the results in the tables. For the results for the CIFAR10 in Table 1, the accuracy reported by GRIT is 76.468 \u00b1 0.881, which should be the top one. In Table 2, the std value of GRIT 2-QiQRW (0.023 \u00b1 0.002) is relatively larger than the GRIT (0.023 \u00b1 0.001), thus the best one should be the later. \n\n5. Simulating the quantum evolution in classical computers is generally a hard problem. While these experiments may be potentially realized on real physical devices in the future, it would be beneficial if the authors could provide more detailed information on memory/CPU usage and training times. This would assist other researchers in assessing the feasibility of replicating the experiments.\n\n\n[1] Tindall J, Searle A, Alhajri A, et al. Quantum physics in connected worlds[J].

Consequently, the main text could benefit from a more balanced structure to ensure clarity in understanding both the rationale behind utilizing quantum computing for positional encoding and the practical implementation of the proposed encoding method. A revision of the main text is recommended to enhance the clarity of the contribution."

A clearer rationale for focusing on these Hamiltonians, such as their implementation efficiency on quantum computers or theoretical advantages, would provide context and enhance the understanding of the research direction.\n2.\tFrom a technical perspective, the proposed encoding methods can be seen as an extension of quantum approximate optimization algorithms (QAOAs). While this is a valid approach, it limits the submission's technical contribution, and a more distinct and innovative angle of contribution could be explored.\n3.\tThe inclusion of numerical simulations to support Theorem 1 is unconventional for an academic paper. To improve clarity and maintain academic rigor, the authors might consider either removing the theorem or reducing the emphasis on theoretical achievements.\n4.\tThe statement in Appendix B.1 regarding measuring multiple correlators to enrich the number of features extracted from the quantum state is somewhat confusing. As the operators $Z_iZ_j$ and $X_iX_j$ are commutable, the results $A_{ij}(\\theta)$ obtained may not change significantly even with the removal of some features, which should be clarified for greater accuracy and coherence in the submission."

Firstly, the notations and variables such as \\( \\theta \\), \\( t \\), \\( \\delta \\), the adjacency matrix \\( A \\), and the feature matrix \\( X \\) require clear definitions within the specific context of the proposed model to improve the paper\u2019s precision and replicability. This precision is particularly needed in Section 3.2.2, where the lack of detailed explanations may leave the reader uncertain about the implementation and significance of the variables used.\n\nMoreover, the paper could strengthen its argument by elucidating the role of the quantum correlation matrix within classical graphical models. A clearer foundational explanation or intuition behind the effectiveness of this integration, especially in support of Theorem 1, would help articulate the purported advantages of the approach.\n\nFinally, the comparative analysis presented in the results, while indicative of improvement, limits its benchmarking to the findings of Ma et al. (2023). Expanding this comparison to include a broader range of contemporary works could provide a more compelling argument for the proposed method's state-of-the-art status. Additionally, it would be constructive to contextualize the scale of improvement, explaining its relevance and potential impact, despite being modest.\n\nIncorporating these enhancements would significantly solidify the paper's contributions and help establish the proposed method's place within the landscape of graph neural network research."
