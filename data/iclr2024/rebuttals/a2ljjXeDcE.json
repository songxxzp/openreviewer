We will include the following result in the revised manuscript. Here is an in-depth analysis.\n\nWe calculated the time complexity with the big O notation of all methods used in our paper. Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be the number of nodes, $|\\mathcal{E}|$ be the number of total edges, $|\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{tr}}|$ be the number of edges connected to training nodes, $d$ be the hidden dimension of the GNN layer, and $K$ be the number of layers. \n\nThen, we can get the time complexity as shown in the below table. The time complexity of GCN was represented in the original GCN paper [1]. Since there are dropping edges or nodes in DropEdge and DropNode, the complexity for data preparation of DropEdge and DropNode is $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$, respectively. Also, the complexity for graph convolution is  $\\mathcal{O}(p|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, where $p \\in [0, 1]$ is a dropping probability. DropMessage considers all edges and nodes in all layers, their complexity is the same as the standard GCN. For M-Mixup, the complexities for data preparation and graph convolution are $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and  $\\mathcal{O}(2|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, respectively. Lastly, in the case of iGraphMix, the complexities for data preparation is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and that for graph convolution is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$.\n\n| Operation           | None                              | DropEdge                           | DropNode                                       | DropMessage                        | M-Mixup                                         | iGraphMix (ours)                                |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) Data Preparation | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                  | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|)$     | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                   | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ |\n| 2) Graph Convolution | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ |  $\\mathcal{O}(2\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$               |\n|                     |                                   |                                    |                                                |                                    |                                                 |                                                 |\n\nFrom this analysis, we found that our method would not need lots of computational complexity, especially compared to M-Mixup. Although some methods require less computational time, our method leads to better performance when training GNNs, highlighting the necessity of the proposed method.\n\nThe below table shows the computational time of data preparation and graph convolution on Cora and ogbn-arxiv datasets. Due to the time constraint, only the computational time for Cora and ogbn-arxiv was represented in this rebuttal instead of covering all the data. The below table shows the mean computational time (second) per epoch. We could find that the real computational time is consistent with our time complexity calculation. We will report these results in the appendix section of the revised manuscript.\n\n| Dataset    | Operation           | Data Augmentation |           |           |         |           ||\n|------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|            |                     | none       | DropEdge | DropNode |DropMessage|M-Mixup | iGraphMix |\n| Cora       | 1) Data preparation | **0.83e-3**    | 1.13e-3   | 1.33e-3   |**0.83e-3**| 1.96e-3 |  3.72e-3  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 1.12e-2    | **1.10e-2**   | 1.10e-2   |1.11e-2| 1.73e-2 |  1.57e-2  |\n| ogbn-arxiv | 1) Data preparation | **1.25e-3**    | 1.34e-3   | 1.39e-3   | **1.25e-3** | 2.61e-2 |  2.56e-2  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 3.32e-2    | **1.76e-2**   | 1.81e-2   | 3.30e-2 | 8.33e-2 |  3.37e-2  |"

First, we select an augmentation method and apply it to the original graph data. For instance, consider the application of DropNode that masks random node features. DropNode generates an augmented graph with some nodes removed from the original graph. Second, iGraphMix is applied to the augmented graph. In this step, with DropNode, iGraphMix performs interpolation on the remaining nodes and edges after DropNode. These two steps enable more diverse graph augmentation.\n\nThe reason for the better result is due to the generation of more varied samples and the mitigation of distorted interrelationships between inputs and labels. By taking these advantages, the efficacy of graph augmentation can be enhanced, supported by our experiment. Furthermore, based on the results, exploring diverse sample generation for iGraphMix presents a promising research direction.\n***\n[1] Kipf et al., Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, ICLR 2017\n\n[2] Berthelot et al., MixMatch: A Holistic Approach to Semi-Supervised Learning., NeurIPS, 2019."

Also, we would like to appreciate the feedback on experiments and presentation details, which help us improve the manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses.\n\n* * *\n### **[W1]** (Performance of iGraphMix and experiments on challenging datasets) \n\n#### 1) Performance of iGraphMix.\nWhile our method shows a small performance improvement compared to the second-best, iGraphMix can be synergized with other augmentation methods. The evidence is shown in Table 2; iGraphMix improves the performance with other augmentation methods by 1.86% on average. Our results show that our method can be easily unified with other augmentation methods to achieve additional performance improvements. Additionally, since this work can be a foundation work for future Input-Mixup research on graph-structured data, we can expect further performance improvement based on our method in future work.\n\n#### 2) Challenging Datasets\n\n\n| Datasets           | WikiCS           | Coauthor-CS |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------|\n| None               | 78.72 (0.18)     | 93.87 (0.02)  |\n| DropEdge           | 79.19 (0.13)     | 93.93 (0.06) |\n| DropNode           | 78.79 (0.34)     | 93.92 (0.05) |\n| DropMessage        | 79.79 (0.33)     | 93.26 (0.05) |\n| M-Mixup            | 79.76 (0.31)     | 94.08 (0.06) |\n| iGraphMix (_ours_) | **80.17 (0.11)** | **94.17 (0.06)** |\n\nThe above table shows the micro-F1 score, which is equal to accuracy in multi-class case, for all augmentation methods on the two challenging datasets, WikiCS [1] and Coauthor-CS [2]. We found that iGraphMix outperformed other baselines on these datasets as well, suggesting that our method can be effective even for the challenging datasets. We also found that the average performance improvement of our method over the second-best method is 0.29% on average, while that of the second-best method over the third-best method is 0.10% on average. It indicates that our method may be better at improving performance than other augmentation methods.\n\nFurthermore, we have previously reported our experiment on large-scale graphs, Reddit and ogbn-product, in Appendix E.1. Since these graphs are significantly large compared to the transductive setting, we conducted inductive training and classification for these datasets. The results for these datasets are represented in Table 5. We found that iGraphMix shows better or comparable performance compared to other augmentation methods regardless of sub-graph sampling methods, backbone architectures, and datasets. It may imply that our method could be effectively applied to large-scale graphs.\n***\n### **[W2]** (Generalization gap of iGraphMix)\n\nWe briefly explain how to calculate the generalization gap and why the test loss can be higher in iGraphMix compared to the standard training. \n\n#### 1) Calculation of the generalization gap.\n\nThe generalization gap is calculated by the difference between the test loss and train loss as in Remark 3.1. The test loss and the train loss are defined as the cross-entropy loss of all test nodes and train nodes in the original graph (the reviewer can find them in Eqs. (2) and (3)).\n\n#### 2) Why can the test loss be higher in iGraphMix?\n\nThe higher test loss in iGraphMix might be due to its smoothing effect of softmax output logits. This effect is because iGraphMix generates smoothed labels via label mixup, leading to smoothed output logits for training data. Given the common assumptions that training and test datasets are similarly distributed and that the training data is sufficiently large for generalization, the smoothing effect extends from the training dataset to the test dataset. Thus, we can find smoothed output logits for test data. While the smoothing effect can increase the test loss, it does not affect the maximum logit values, so there is a weak correlation between the test loss and the micro-F1 score (accuracy). Moreover, our theoretical and empirical findings demonstrate that iGraphMix narrows the generalization gap between training and test losses, indicating the proposed method's strong generalization capability\u200b\u200b."

                        "value": "***\n### **[W3]** (Details about Appendix B.)\n\n#### 1) Clarification of $AX=AX\u2019=A\\tilde{X}$.\n\nWe bring the matrix-level notation down to the node level to clarify what it means. Before explaining why the equation holds, we note that $A$ has no diagonal components. It means that there is no self-loop of all nodes. The equation is equivalent to $AX_v=AX'_v=A\\tilde{X}_v \\forall v$ in all labeled nodes. First, $AX_v=AX\u2019_v$ is satisfied because nodes in the graph are permutation invariant. Second, we get $AX_v=A\\tilde{X}_v$ because unlabeled nodes are not interpolated. These are valid for all labeled nodes, so we can combine them into the matrix notation.\n\n#### 2) Proof sketch\n\nThe goal of our proof is to approximate the loss function of iGraphMix via second-order Taylor Approximation to understand the regularization effect (Lemma 5.2.). Here, $AX_v=AX\u2019_v=A\\tilde{X}_v$ is a crucial precondition for deriving Lemma B.1. and B.2. These lemmas are necessary to make zero of a first-order term of the approximated loss, leading us to the desired regularization term. Consequently, we get the regularization term and define the weight space of GCN trained with iGraphMix as a related dual form of the regularization term as illustrated in equation (7). Considering the weight space into Transductive Rademacher Complexity (TRC), we could get Theorem 5.3., which reveals the upper bound of the generalization gap of iGraphMix. Subsequently, with appropriate beta distribution parameters, we can make the lower generalization upper bound, showing the effectiveness of our method.\n\n***\n### **[W4]** (Simple baselines)\n\nWe understand the importance of comparing our method with a wide range of baselines, including Kong et al [3]. However, the most important factor we considered in selecting a baseline was to ensure a direct and fair comparison of data augmentation methods under similar experimental conditions. The inclusion of methods with additional training techniques (e.g., min-max optimization, and robust optimization) violates our consideration. Our concern was that integrating those methods without their unique training techniques may distort their original intention, and it could potentially make a skewed comparison. However, since including previous work that the reviewer mentioned [3] is crucial, we will briefly summarize and highlight this work\u2019s importance in the related work section of the revised manuscript.\n\n***\n### **[W5]** (Related works on other tasks)\n\n\nWhile numerous mix-up methods [4,5,6,7,8] have been proposed for graph classification, our related work section does not include them for the following reason. They primarily focus on node matching across different graphs, which is out-of-scope. Also, as their application to node classification is limited, we exclude them from our related work.\n\n***\n### **[Q1]** (Versatility of iGraphMix)\n\niGraphMix demonstrates its versatility by integrating with other augmentation methods applied to graph data, similar to MixMatch [9] which proposed the effective combination of augmentation methods and Mixup. This integration is executed as the following process.\n\nFirst, we select an augmentation method and apply it to the original graph data. For instance, consider the application of DropNode that masks random node features. DropNode generates an augmented graph with some nodes removed from the original graph. \n\nSecond, iGraphMix is applied to the augmented graph. In this step, iGraphMix performs interpolation on the remaining nodes and edges after the DropNode. These two steps enable more diverse graph augmentation. \n***\n### **[Q2]** (Evaluation metric)\n\nTo address the concern regarding our choice of the micro-F1 score over accuracy, we would like to explain the reasons as follows. First, in multi-class classification tasks, such as our paper\u2019s task, the micro-F1 score and accuracy are equivalent. This is because each data point is unequivocally assigned to one class, and it is described in detail in the paper [10]. Second, although their values are the same, we would like to denote it as a micro-F1 score rather than an accuracy. The micro-F1 score, encompassing both precision and recall, offers a balanced perspective on model performance. This is particularly relevant in our context, where the understanding of true versus predicted class distributions is crucial. Last, there are many references [10, 11] to represent the performance as micro-F1 score in the node classification. Therefore, we represent the performance using the micro-F1 score in our paper."

To handle the irregularity and alignment issue for graph mixup, this paper proposes to generate virtual nodes and edges by interpolating features and labels, and attaching sampled neighborhoods. Theoretical analysis shows that iGraphMixup can be regarded as a regularization on the weight space to help improve the generalization. Experiments on real world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on node classification."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer for the recognition of our novelty and analysis. Also, we would like to appreciate the guidance provided on experiments and writing quality, which help us improve the manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses. We respond to some weaknesses and questions simultaneously because of their similarity.\n\n* * *\n\n### **[W1 & Q1]** (Robustness) \n\nTo evaluate the robustness, we conducted two additional experiments on Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed. For all experiments, we used GCN as the backbone model. We will include these results in the Appendix of our revised manuscript. We hope these experiments may resolve the reviewer\u2019s concern.\n\n#### 1) Feature noise\n\nWe evaluated the robustness when the feature noise is introduced in the graph. The feature noise is provided by adding standard Gaussian noise to input features with a probability of noise level. The below table shows how robust our method is for the feature noise. We indicated that our method outperforms the standard training in all noise levels.\n\n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level (%) | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 66.90 (1.54) | 66.89 (1.72) | 66.12 (1.73) | 78.10 (1.47) | 77.76 (1.54) | 77.92 (1.58) | 75.46 (1.67) | 74.62 (1.96) | 73.36 (2.49) |\n| iGraphMix | 68.48 (1.70) | 68.54 (1.58) | 68.30 (2.08) | 79.00 (2.41) | 78.64 (2.29) | 78.76 (2.94) | 75.78 (1.90) | 75.80 (2.03) | 74.88 (2.37) |\n\n#### 2) Structural Noise\n\nWe assessed the robustness when the graph contains structural noise. The structural noise is given by randomly adding and removing edges with a probability of noise level. The below table shows the results of how the proposed method is robust to the structural noise. We found that when structural noise is introduced, GCN trained with iGraphMix outperforms GCN trained without iGraphMix (None). In addition, as the noise level increases from 10% to 40%, our method achieves more performance improvement compared to the standard training (None). \n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level (%) | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 67.62 (1.02) | 61.88 (1.10) | 54.90 (1.97) | 78.62 (0.56) | 73.14 (0.37) | 60.96 (0.84) | 73.92 (0.37) | 71.88 (0.53) | 60.20 (0.58) |\n| iGraphMix | 68.94 (1.11) | 63.22 (0.38) | 55.82 (0.46) | 79.14 (0.47) | 74.06 (0.31) | 61.78 (0.82) | 74.54 (0.10) | 72.56 (0.54) | 61.22 (0.61) |\n\n#### 3) Label Noise\n\nWe assessed the robustness when the graph contains label noise.  We randomly permuted training labels with a probability of noise level for this experiment.  We trained GCN with the noisy training labels and evaluated GCN's performance. The below table shows how robust our method for noise labels is. We indicated that our method outperforms the standard training in all noise levels.\n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 79.10 (0.74) | 76.00 (1.07) | 67.60 (2.72) | 68.24 (2.40) | 64.14 (2.04) | 57.72 (4.65) | 77.32 (1.36) | 75.76 (2.52) | 68.64 (3.15) |\n| iGraphMix | 80.02 (0.86) | 76.42 (1.54) | 69.08 (2.11) | 69.08 (1.97) | 65.92 (2.30) | 58.62 (3.48) | 77.66 (1.55) | 76.00 (2.64) | 69.04 (3.59) |"

However, the most important factor we considered in selecting a baseline was to ensure a direct and fair comparison of data augmentation methods under similar experimental conditions. The inclusion of methods with additional training techniques (e.g., co-training, using the original graph for training, and auxiliary losses and models for manifold mixup) violates our consideration. Our concern was that integrating those methods without their unique training techniques may distort their original intention, and it could potentially make a skewed comparison. However, since including previous work that the reviewer mentioned [1] is crucial, we briefly summarized and highlighted this work\u2019s importance in the related work section.\n\n***\n### **[Q3]** (Details about Eq. (4))\n\nWe clarify that the direct addition of $M_\\lambda \\cdot A$, $X$ and its permuted counterpart $M_{1-\\lambda} \\cdot A\u2019$, $X\u2019$ is feasible since the size of each matrix remains the same even if the rows and columns are permuted. Specifically, when we apply mixup during the training, there is an alignment issue between neighboring nodes, but we are simply addressing the alignment issue by concatenating and constructing new edge sets in the new virtual graph through a simple direct addition. In addition, masking matrices do not need to be symmetric.\n***\n### **[W2 & Q4]** (Writing quality)\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion. We will revise $\\tilde{Y}{v,v\u2019}$ to $\\tilde{Y}{v}^{v\u2019}$ for resolving some misleading problem. Moreover, we will double-check and fix typos, such as the \u2018matrix\u2019 line below Eq.(1), in the revised manuscript. Again, thanks for the reviewer\u2019s advice.\n\n***\n[1] Verma et al., Improved Training of GNNs for Semi-Supervised Learning, AAAI, 2021."

Specifically, in addition to the original response (https://openreview.net/forum?id=a2ljjXeDcE&noteId=Tr5QDvUSTT), we will include additional robustness results for other baselines. Also, we will expand our empirical evaluation with more baselines such as ifMixup [1], which was originally proposed for graph classification but can be easily adapted to node classification. The below table shows the results of ifMixup on CiteSeer and Cora datasets. Although we have conducted the experiment on the two datasets due to time constraints, we plan to extend this to the additional datasets in the revised manuscript. This additional analysis will be integrated into the revised manuscript. We acknowledge your suggestion to include GraphMix [2] as a baseline. However, we omit it in our manuscript to avoid distorting the original paper's intention, as GraphMix involves additional training techniques. We acknowledge the approaching deadline for the Author/Reviewer discussion and will make these enhancements as promptly as possible to strengthen our work.\n\nWe are grateful for your recognition of the theoretical soundness of our paper and understand your stance on the current rating.

                        "value": "We would like to appreciate the reviewer providing constructive feedback and detailed suggestions, which help us improve the manuscript. Below, we provide point-by-point responses. Some weaknesses and questions are addressed simultaneously due to their similarity.\n\n* * *\n\n### **[W1, Q1]** (Sensitivity analysis on iGraphMix) \n\nWe have conducted the sensitivity analysis of $\\beta$ in Figure 3 because it is the only hyperparameter for the proposed method. In addition to $\\beta$, we have experimented with the number of layers $K$, a hyperparameter for GNNs, in Figure 4(a). We also have analyzed the number of labeled nodes per class $L$ in Figure 4(b) since the performance of GNNs is related to $L$.\n\nFigure 3 demonstrates a consistent reduction in the generalization gap according to the various beta. Notably, this gap becomes larger as beta increases, signifying more well-mixed graphs via iGraphMix. However, as beta decreases, the performance of iGraphMix approaches that of standard training, suggesting a lower bound where the benefits of mixup are less pronounced. This observation highlights the importance of a well-calibrated mixing coefficient to fully harness the potential of iGraphMix.\n\n***\n\n### **[W2, Q2]** (Ablation study on iGraphMix)\n\n| Datasets       | CiteSeer     | Cora         | PubMed       |\n|-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| None            | 72.05 (0.56) | 82.65 (0.55) | 79.32 (0.15) |\n| iGraphMix (input+label) | 71.50 (0.47) | 81.26 (0.27) | 79.18 (0.53) |\n| iGraphMix (edge+label)  | 72.44 (0.81) | 82.72 (0.21) | 79.18 (0.33) |\n| iGraphMix (input+edge+label) (_proposed_)  | **73.67 (0.61)** | **83.78 (0.42)** | **79.93 (0.60)** |\n\nWe conducted the ablation study on iGraphMix and the result is summarized in the above table. Specifically, we compared our method with 1) applying mixup only to input and label and 2) applying mixup only to edge and label on three transductive datasets for node classification. We observed that iGraphMix (input + edge+ label) consistently outperforms not only the standard training but also iGraphMix (input+label), and iGraphMix (edge+label). It may imply that interpolating all components of the graph is crucial, showing our method\u2019s effectiveness. Furthermore, iGraphMix (input+label) consistently underperformed the standard training, and iGraphMix (edge+label) is better or comparable to the standard training. It may imply the importance of applying mixup on the edge. \n\n***\n\n### **[W3, Q3, Q8]** (Discussions on the limitations of this work)\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to address the importance of the discussion. We will include this discussion in the revised manuscript. Here is the potential limitation of our method and theoretical analysis.\n\n#### 1) The limitation of our method\n\niGraphMix may not be as effective for certain types of graphs where the underlying assumption of our method may not hold. This limitation suggests us to design an advanced and adaptive edge sampling method for tailoring it to each graph. Addressing it is a promising direction for future research, which could further optimize the applicability of iGraphMix across various graphs.\n\n#### 2) The limitation of the theoretical analysis\n\nOur theoretical analysis primarily focused on the two-layer GCN may not fully capture more complex and real-world scenarios. We believe that future works on extending multi-layer GCN could handle this limitation."

Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be the number of nodes, $|\\mathcal{E}|$ be the number of total edges, $|\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{tr}}|$ be the number of edges connected to training nodes, $d$ be the hidden dimension of the GNN layer, and $K$ be the number of layers. \n\nThen, we can get the time complexity as shown in the below table. The time complexity of GCN was represented in the original GCN paper [1]. Since there are dropping edges or nodes in DropEdge and DropNode, the complexity for data preparation of DropEdge and DropNode is $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$, respectively. Also, the complexity of graph convolution is  $\\mathcal{O}(p|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, where $p \\in [0, 1]$ is a dropping probability. DropMessage considers all edges and nodes in all layers, their complexity is the same as the standard GCN. For M-Mixup, the complexities for data preparation and graph convolution are $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and  $\\mathcal{O}(2|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, respectively. Lastly, in the case of iGraphMix, the complexities for data preparation is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and that for graph convolution is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$.\n\n| Operation           | None                              | DropEdge                           | DropNode                                       | DropMessage                        | M-Mixup                                         | iGraphMix (ours)                                |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) Data Preparation | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                  | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|)$     | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                   | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ |\n| 2) Graph Convolution | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ |  $\\mathcal{O}(2\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$               |\n|                     |                                   |                                    |                                                |                                    |                                                 |                                                 |\n\nFrom this analysis, we found that our method would not need lots of computational complexity, especially compared to M-Mixup. Although some methods require less computational time, our method leads to better performance when training GNNs, highlighting the necessity of the proposed method.\n\nThe below table shows the computational time of data preparation and graph convolution on Cora and ogbn-arxiv datasets. Due to the time constraint, only the computational time for Cora and ogbn-arxiv was represented in this rebuttal instead of covering all the data. The below table shows the mean computational time (second) per epoch. We could find that the real computational time is consistent with our time complexity calculation. We will report these results in the appendix section of the revised manuscript.\n\n| Dataset    | Operation           | Data Augmentation |           |           |         |           | |\n|------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-----------|\n|            |                     | none       | DropEdge | DropNode |DropMessage|M-Mixup | iGraphMix |\n| Cora       | 1) Data preparation | **0.83e-3**    | 1.13e-3   | 1.33e-3   |**0.83e-3**| 1.96e-3 |  3.72e-3  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 1.12e-2    | **1.10e-2**   | 1.10e-2   |1.11e-2| 1.73e-2 |  1.57e-2  |\n| ogbn-arxiv | 1) Data preparation | **1.25e-3**    | 1.34e-3   | 1.39e-3   | **1.25e-3** | 2.61e-2 |  2.56e-2  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 3.32e-2    | **1.76e-2**   | 1.81e-2   | 3.30e-2 | 8.33e-2 |  3.37e-2  |"

                        "value": "***\n### **[Q5]** (iGraphMix on large graphs)\n\nDue to the paper limitation, we reported our experiment on large-scale graphs, such as Reddit and ogbn-product, in Appendix E.1. Since these graphs are significantly large for considering the transductive setting, we conducted inductive training and classification on these datasets. It means that we sampled sub-graphs from whole graphs and trained GNNs via those graphs. The results for these datasets are represented in Table 5. We found that iGraphMix is better or comparable to other augmentation methods regardless of sub-graph sampling methods, backbone architectures, and datasets. It may imply that our method could be effectively applied to large-scale graphs.\n***\n### **[Q6]** (iGraphMix on other tasks)\n\n In Appendix E.2., we have included a detailed experiment on link prediction. Our results are summarized in Table 6. It demonstrates that iGraphMix not only outperforms in node classification but also shows significant improvement in link prediction compared to other augmentation methods. It can be evidence of the extension of our method to other graph-based tasks.  We leave the application of iGraphmix to graph classification to future work as mixing two different graphs necessitates addressing the complexities of node matching across different graphs.\n***\n\n### **[Q7]** (iGraphMix on graphs with various characteristics)\n\n| Datasets     | Cora  | CiteSeer | PubMed | ogbn-arxiv | Flickr |\n|--------------|-------|----------|--------|------------|--------|\n| Sparsity (%) | 0.082 | 0.144    | 0.023  | 0.008      | 0.011  |\n| Avg. Degree  | 2.74  | 3.90     | 4.50   | 2.74       | 10.08  |\n\nIn the table above, we have examined the sparsity and the average degree of all the graph datasets used in our experiment. We discovered that the datasets exhibit varying levels of sparsity and average degree. Upon correlating these statistics with our findings, we have confirmed that iGraphMix has the potential to substantially enhance GNNs\u2019 performance.\n***\n\n### **[Q9]** (Ethical consideration) \n\nWe realize that ensuring our method may not mitigate biases or inequalities. Our work initially focused on the technical aspects and did not explicitly address potential biases or inequalities that might arise. However, we think that there can be a potential future direction to address biases and inequalities in algorithms. For instance, similar to Fair Mixup [2], our method can be improved to mitigate potential harmful biases in node classification.\n\n***\n[1] Kipf et al., Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, ICLR 2017\n\n[2] Chuang et al., Fair Mixup: Fairness via Interpolation, ICLR, 2021"

For all experiments, we used GCN as the backbone model. We will include these results in the Appendix in our revised manuscript. We hope these experiments may resolve the reviewer\u2019s concern.\n\n#### 1) Feature noise\n\nWe evaluated the robustness when the feature noise is introduced in the graph. The feature noise is provided by adding standard Gaussian noise to input features with a probability of noise level. The below table shows how robust our method is for the feature noise. We indicated that our method outperforms the standard training in all noise levels.\n\n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level (%) | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 66.90 (1.54) | 66.89 (1.72) | 66.12 (1.73) | 78.10 (1.47) | 77.76 (1.54) | 77.92 (1.58) | 75.46 (1.67) | 74.62 (1.96) | 73.36 (2.49) |\n| iGraphMix | 68.48 (1.70) | 68.54 (1.58) | 68.30 (2.08) | 79.00 (2.41) | 78.64 (2.29) | 78.76 (2.94) | 75.78 (1.90) | 75.80 (2.03) | 74.88 (2.37) |\n\n#### 2) Structural noise\n\nWe assessed the robustness when the graph contains structural noise. The structural noise is given by randomly adding and removing edges with a probability of noise level. The below table shows the results of how the proposed method is robust to the structural noise. We found that when structural noise is introduced, GCN trained with iGraphMix outperforms GCN trained without iGraphMix (None). In addition, as the noise level increases from 10% to 40%, our method achieves more performance improvement compared to the standard training (None). \n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level (%) | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 67.62 (1.02) | 61.88 (1.10) | 54.90 (1.97) | 78.62 (0.56) | 73.14 (0.37) | 60.96 (0.84) | 73.92 (0.37) | 71.88 (0.53) | 60.20 (0.58) |\n| iGraphMix | 68.94 (1.11) | 63.22 (0.38) | 55.82 (0.46) | 79.14 (0.47) | 74.06 (0.31) | 61.78 (0.82) | 74.54 (0.10) | 72.56 (0.54) | 61.22 (0.61) |\n\n#### 3) Label Noise\n\nWe assessed the robustness when the graph contains label noise.  We randomly permuted training labels with a probability of noise level for this experiment.  We trained GCN with the noisy training labels and evaluated GCN's performance. The below table shows how robust our method for noise labels is. We indicated that our method outperforms the standard training in all noise levels.\n\n| Dataset   | Cora         |              |              | CiteSeer     |              |              | PubMed       |              |              |\n|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Noise level | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          | 10%          | 20%          | 40%          |\n| None      | 79.10 (0.74) | 76.00 (1.07) | 67.60 (2.72) | 68.24 (2.40) | 64.14 (2.04) | 57.72 (4.65) | 77.32 (1.36) | 75.76 (2.52) | 68.64 (3.15) |\n| iGraphMix | 80.02 (0.86) | 76.42 (1.54) | 69.08 (2.11) | 69.08 (1.97) | 65.92 (2.30) | 58.62 (3.48) | 77.66 (1.55) | 76.00 (2.64) | 69.04 (3.59) |"

                        "value": "***\n### **[Q1]** (Time complexity)\n\nFrom Big O complexity analysis and the experiment, we indicated that our method does not exacerbate the computational speed. We will include the following result in the revised manuscript. Here is an in-depth analysis.\n\nWe calculated the time complexity with the big O notation of all methods used in our paper. Let $\\mathcal{V}$ be the number of nodes, $|\\mathcal{E}|$ be the number of total edges, $|\\mathcal{E}_{\\mathrm{tr}}|$ be the number of edges connected to training nodes, $d$ be the hidden dimension of the GNN layer, and $K$ be the number of layers. \n\nThen, we can get the time complexity as shown in the below table. The time complexity of GCN was represented in the original GCN paper [1]. Since there are dropping edges or nodes in DropEdge and DropNode, the complexity for data preparation of DropEdge and DropNode is $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{E}|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$, respectively. Also, the complexity of graph convolution is  $\\mathcal{O}(p|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, where $p \\in [0, 1]$ is a dropping probability. DropMessage considers all edges and nodes in all layers, their complexity is the same as the standard GCN. For M-Mixup, the complexities for data preparation and graph convolution are $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and  $\\mathcal{O}(2|\\mathcal{E}|d^K)$, respectively. Lastly, in the case of iGraphMix, the complexities for data preparation is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ and that for graph convolution is $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$.\n\n| Operation           | None                              | DropEdge                           | DropNode                                       | DropMessage                        | M-Mixup                                         | iGraphMix (ours)                                |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| 1) Data Preparation | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                  | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|)$     | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(1)$                   | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|+2\\|\\mathcal{V}\\|)$ |\n| 2) Graph Convolution | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(p\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$ | $\\mathcal{O}(2\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$             | $\\mathcal{O}(\\|\\mathcal{E}\\|d^K)$               |\n|                     |                                   |                                    |                                                |                                    |                                                 |                                                 |\n\nFrom this analysis, we found that our method would not need lots of computational complexity, especially compared to M-Mixup. Although some methods require less computational time, our method leads to better performance when training GNNs, highlighting the necessity of the proposed method.\n\nThe below table shows the computational time of data preparation and graph convolution on Cora and ogbn-arxiv datasets. Due to the time constraint, only the computational time for Cora and ogbn-arxiv was represented in this rebuttal instead of covering all the data. The below table shows the mean computational time (second) per epoch. We could find that the real computational time is consistent with our time complexity calculation. We will report these results in the appendix section of the revised manuscript.\n\n| Dataset    | Operation           | Data Augmentation |           |           |         |           ||\n|------------|---------------------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|\n|            |                     | none       | DropEdge | DropNode |DropMessage|M-Mixup | iGraphMix |\n| Cora       | 1) Data preparation | **0.83e-3**    | 1.13e-3   | 1.33e-3   |**0.83e-3**| 1.96e-3 |  3.72e-3  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 1.12e-2    | **1.10e-2**   | 1.10e-2   |1.11e-2| 1.73e-2 |  1.57e-2  |\n| ogbn-arxiv | 1) Data preparation | **1.25e-3**    | 1.34e-3   | 1.39e-3   | **1.25e-3** | 2.61e-2 |  2.56e-2  |\n|            | 2) Graph Convolution         | 3.32e-2    | **1.76e-2**   | 1.81e-2   | 3.30e-2 | 8.33e-2 |  3.37e-2  |\n\n***\n[1] Kipf et al., Semi-supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks, ICLR 2017"
