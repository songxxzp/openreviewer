The significance and roles of each term, notably $G_t$ and $\\eta_t$, are not adequately explained. Furthermore, the insights or conclusions that readers should glean from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 ought to be more comprehensively discussed.\n\nSimilar issue appear to Theorem 2.\n\n3) The discussion of the experiments is sparse.\n\n4) Most importantly, the purpose of a fairness attack remains unclear to me. What specific objective does a fairness attacker want to attack the fairness of an ML model? Consequently, I question the emphasis on increasing model fairness against such attackers. Addressing fairness issues stemming from data or algorithmic biases appears to be more important.\n\nBased on the last question, I will first give a confidence score 2.

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed comment. For a better clarification of our framework, we refer to the **revised version** of our paper in the following discussion. Specifically, in the revised version, Thm1&2 are about guaranteeing fairness robustness using accuracy robustness, and Thm3 is about guaranteeing accuracy robustness using fairness robustness.\n\n### [Weakness 1 (W1), W2: Explanation of Theorem 1 and 2] \nWe refer to Theorem 2 in the revised paper to show the practical implication of Theorem 1 in the revised paper regarding the fair adversarial training framework. Specifically, in the revised version, the upper-bound of fairness robustness regarding samples in the \"Opposite Direction\" in Theorem 1 allows us to upper-bound changes of EOd and DI under the fairness attack using static fairness, i.e., fairness issues stemming from data or algorithmic biases without the adversarial perturbtion, and accuracy robustness of the model. Consequently, Theorem 1 and 2 in the revised version provides theoretical guarantee to our fair adversarial training framework.\n\n### [W3: Discussion of the experiments] \nThank you for the suggestion. We 'll inlcude more analysis regarding the experimental results in final version.\n\n### [W4: Motivation of the fairness attack] \nWe agree with the reviewer that static fairness, namely fairness issues stemming from data or algorithmic biases is an important problem, and therefore our fair adversarial framework takes into account both static fairness and fairness robustness, as shown in Eq. 5. Similar to that of the accuracy attack, in terms of pracitcal applicability, it is peculiar to intentionally depreciate a model's accuracy or fairness, unless out of some egregious concern, as dicussed in Fig.1 of the main paper. Instead, the fairness attack can be considered as means of measuring of generalizability of model in terms of fairness on some unknown data under the worst-case scenario. As discussed in Section 6.2 of the main paper, under a successful accuracy attack, the accuracy of the model decreases to 0, while the DI or EOd does not show a monotonic increase as the perturbation level of the accuracy attack increases. This shows that the accuracy attack alone does not provide adequate information in terms of the generalizability regarding the fairness of the model under dynamic secnarios. Therefore, as with the accuracy attack, we propose the fairness attack to quantify the generalizability of a model in terms of fairness regarding the worst-case scenario."

As it is stated that:\n\n> the fairness attack can be considered as means of measuring of generalizability of model in terms of fairness on some unknown data under the worst-case scenario.\n\nThe setting seems very conservative to me. \n\nWe could compare this setting with a typical adversarial scenario. Adversarial training isn't primarily done for generalizability in worst-case scenarios; rather, it's tailored for actual attack situations. If there are no real-world attacks, people will not employ adversarial training. Instead, they will use more suited techniques to enhancing generalizability in worst-case conditions.\nConsequently, this setting still strikes me as somewhat artificial."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- The concept of an adversarial attack concerning a group fairness measure seem unconventional. While existing adversarial attacks utilize point-wise objectives, the proposed fairness attack employs a group-wise objective such as DI or EOd. When this proposed attack is applied at a single point, it can influence all subsequent attacks from other points. This leads to a notational issue in defining fairness adversarial samples: $L_{DI}$ and $L(x, a, y)$ are used interchangeably. It might be more suitable to carry out the attack using individual fairness measures.\n\n- The presentation of fairness robustness lacks clarity in its definition. Only expressions - related to fairness robustness, indicate improved fairness robustness - are presented. The absence of a clear definition weakens the authors' assertions.\n\n- The main assertion here is that the robustness secured by accuracy adversarial samples can guarantee fairness robustness, and vice versa. However, there appears to be a significant issue. When a fairness attack is executed with an objective like DI, its evaluation relies on cross-entropy. Then, in terms of accuracy robustness, fairness attacks essentially amount to weaker attacks on cross-entropy compared to PGD attacks with a cross-entropy objective. In light of this, the proposed claims about alignment of robustnesses become somewhat trivial, potentially diminishing the authors' contributions.\n\n- Being robust to PGD attacks does not necessarily imply the overall adversarial robustness of the model. For a more reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness, I would encourage you to consider using AutoAttack (AA) [1]. AA comprises three white-box attacks (APGD and APGD-DLR as described in [1], and FAB in [2]), along with one black-box attack (Square Attack [3]). In the recent field of adversarial robustness research, it has become a standard practice to report robust accuracies against AA as a means of assessing gradient obfuscation [4].\n\n- (Notational Problems) The authors are simultaneously using $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ and $D(x_{sub,a})$. To express this more appropriately, I suggest that $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ should be utilized as notation for group characteristics, for example: $D_{sub,a}^{DI}=\\min_{sub,a}D(x)$. Furthermore, the notation $x_{sub,a}$ can be confusing, as it refers to a subgroup at times and to an individual point at other times. The lack of a formal definition for fairness robustness is connected to these issues.\n\n\n[1] Croce, F. and Hein, M.

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed comment. For a better clarification regarding the notation and our framework, we refer to the **revised version** of our paper in the following discussion. Specifically, in the revised version, Thm1&2 are about guaranteeing fairness robustness using accuracy robustness, and Thm3 is about guaranteeing accuracy robustness using fairness robustness.\n\n### [Weakness 1 (W1): Formulation of the fairness attack] \nWe would like to clarify that both the fairness attack and the accuracy attack employ collective adversarial objectives, rather than point-wise objectives. Regarding the poisoning attacks, the adversarial objectives take into account the statistical properties of the classifier at a collective level, such as accuracy or DI/EOd subject to the specified targets, rather than the point-wise objectives as in the evasion attacks.\n\nMoreover, similar to that of the accuracy attack, while the adversarial objective is targeted against the statistical properties of the model, i.e., DI and EOd of the model, the fairness attack on different data points are independent. This is further discussed in Eq. 2 and Eq. 3 of the main paper, which is a instance-wise reformulation of Eq. 1. While the estimation of DI and EOd relies on group information, regarding gradient-based fairness attack, the adversarial objective $L_{\\text{DI}}$ only takes into account the soft predicton of $x_i$, and information from all the other points can be treated as constants, as they do not affect the update of the fairness adversarial samples by $x_i$. **Therefore, the fairness attack applied to one single instance does not influence the subsequential attacks for the others, and the adversarial attack is performed based on purely the gradient information of the trained model w.r.t. the very instance.**\n\n### [W2: Definition of fairness robustness] \nThe definition of fairness robustness is presented in the introduction of main paper: \"Here we similarly define fairness robustness as a model\u2019s ability to resist adversarial perturbation by an fairness attack and remain same predictions on clean and fairness adversarial samples.\", i.e., $\\mathbb{P}\\_{x \\sim \\mathcal{D}\\_{\\mathcal{X}}}[\\exists \\|\\epsilon^{\\text{Fair}}\\| \\le \\epsilon\\_0$ s.t. $f(x+\\epsilon^{\\text{Fair}}) \\neq f(x)]$ where $\\epsilon^{\\text{Fair}}$ is specified by the fairness attack. This reflects the consistency of the classifier to maintain the same predictions both with and without the adversarial perturbation under the fairness attack. Similarly, in the introduction, we define accuracy robustness as \"a model's ability to resist adversarial perturbation by an accuracy attack and remain same predictions on clean and accuracy adversarial samples.\", i.e., $\\mathbb{P}\\_{x \\sim \\mathcal{D}\\_{\\mathcal{X}}}[\\exists \\|\\epsilon^{\\text{Acc}}\\| \\le \\epsilon\\_0$ s.t. $f(x+\\epsilon^{\\text{Acc}}) \\neq f(x)]$ where $\\epsilon^{\\text{Acc}}$ is specified by the accuracy attack. This reflects the consistency of the classifier to maintain the same predictions both with and without the adversarial perturbation under the accuracy attack.\n\n### [W3: Alignment of robustness] \nRegarding the effect of adversarial attack, both the magnitude and the direction of the attack matter. As discussed in Section 4 of the main paper, The fairness attack and the accuracy attack acts upon different directions regarding different samples. Under the same step size and the same perturbation level up to the same iterations, the fairness attack and the accuracy attack act equivalently upon samples in the 'Same Direction' category. For samples in the 'Opposite Direction' category, the fairness attack and the accuracy attack act towards the opposite directions. We cannot assert that \"weaker attacks on cross-entropy\" leads to trivial alignment between fairness robustness and accuracy robustness, owing to the misalignment in the direction of the two attacks. Therefore, we show in Theorem 1 in the revised paper that the fairness robustness, measured by the change in cross-entropy loss before and after the fairness attack, regarding $x_{\\text{FN},1}$ is upper-bounded by the accuracy robustness of $x_{\\text{FN},0}$, i.e., the fairness robustness guarantee by accuracy robustness. Moreover, our discussion in Theorem 3 in the revised paper also points to the non-trivialness of the problem: if the fairness robustness amounts to weaker robustness than the accuracy robustness, we cannot have the accuracy robustness guarantee by the fairness robustness."

We 'll include full results on other datasets in final version.  \n\n### [W5: Notational issues] \nThank you for the detailed suggestion. Please refer to the revised version for a more comprehensive version of notations.\n\n### [Question 1 (Q1): Accuracy in the experiments] \nThe accuracy in the experiments refers to both standard accuracy and robust accuracy. As shown in Fig. 2 and 3, when the perturbation level $\\epsilon$ equals zero, it corresponds to the standard accuracy results. Under non-zero perturbation levels, it gives the robust accuracy results.\n\n### [Q2: Calculation of $D(x_{\\text{FN},female})$] \nThe values in Table 2 are calculated based on the group-wise average. For example, $D(x_{\\text{FN},female}) = \\frac{1}{|\\{\\text{FN},female\\}|}\\sum_{x_i \\in \\{\\text{FN},female\\}} D(x_i)$.\n\n### [Q3: Setting of $\\gamma$] \nThe $L$ term in Eq. 5 corresponds to the fairness measures, i.e., DI or EOd in our discussion. It is hard to directly set $\\gamma$ as some constant during training, as the fairness measures are intractable and non-differentiable. Instead, during training, $\\gamma$ is integrated as a Lagrangian multiplier as a fairness regularizer where the multiplier value varies by the methods, and the hyperparameters of different methods (preprocessing, in-processing and post-processing) are tuned as suggested by the authors in the original paper to find the best performance in terms of fairness.\n\n[1] Croce, F. and Hein, M.

                        "value": "I appreciate the points raised in the rebuttal. The authors' research findings are inherently dependent on the definitions of both accuracy robustness and fairness robustness. While the authors presented definitions for both in the rebuttal, there are no theoretical results in this paper that directly utilize this definition. To make this paper more meaningful, the main theorem should establish inequalities that connect the well-defined accuracy robustness with the well-defined fairness robustness. Moreover, the authors' other definitions are also unclear (e.g. using mixed notations for a sample and a subgroup) as I previously mentioned, making it difficult to even evaluate. Therefore, currently, the authors' arguments are weak and disorganized. Despite my appreciation for the authors' efforts, I will maintain my current rating."
