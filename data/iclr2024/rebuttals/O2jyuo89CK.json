                    "value": "Introduction:\nDifferentiates between vector and pixel representations, and claims the former is pressed (somehow)\non creativity while the latter is based on perception. These claims I have weak sympathy with, but\nwhich I don\u2019t fully agree with (surely people draw with lines/vector because that is how they perceive\nthe world). The are made without any citation into either the perceptual or artistic / art-history literature.\nAnd they pervade the first part of the paper, making slightly uncomfortable reading for me - feeling that\nthe argument made may even mislead. I\u2019d like to see it changed, but given my greater sympathy towards\nthe use of vectors over pixels, it\u2019s not something I will insist upon other than \u201cthink again about the argument\u201d.\n\nRelated Works:\nThe paper touches upon only a very small fraction of the available literature, and fails to cite any paper prior to 2015 - even though there is a large body of work (see the non-photorealistic rendering literature).\nMore on this later.\n\nMethod\nThe method is to represent a drawing with a set of strokes, the exact number does not matter.\nI very much like the fact the authors acknowledge strokes are not independent, but use \nDe-Finetti\u2019s Theorem of Exchangeability - which I am not familiar with (so thanks for the introduction)\nso that they are conditionally independent.\n\nI am less convinced by the use of quadratic curves to represent strokes. Strokes can be long\nand very complex. Example - a drawing of curly hair may use long, looped strokes. And strokes vary \nin width, media density and much more. I understand this is a first step - but some text that acknowledges\nthe very severe limitations the method operates under is, i think necessary so that the contribution can\nbe more fairly understood.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to me why the generator produces a face (in the same view angle, or its mirror, and\nwith the same crop window). This again is very limiting.\n\nResults:\nThe authors make no experiments at all. This is a significant weakness in the paper.\nRather they show some images that have been generated, and then claim the images look good.\nUnfortunately for the authors, others (like me) have a different position.\nI am not convinced the drawings are \u201chigh quality\u201d as claimed.\nEspecially when compared to the NPR work my view is that output produced in recent years is low quality.\nAnd no work I have seen in comparable in quality to human art.\n\nThe fact drawing are usually made of some actual thing, like a face or a dog.\nThe paper never mentions how to control the output to direct it to a particular noun class.\n(Does the noun class impact the embedding into latent space? I guess so - it depends on S)\nAll the images are of faces, and all in \u201cmanga\u201d style.\nThis means the paper is not clear on its generality.\nDo you have examples of other noun classes?\n\nConclusion:\nI found the conclusion rather limited. I certainly disagree with the claim that \n  \u201cthe primary limitation lies in the probabilistic nature of the reconstruction process\u201d.\nIn fact the primary limitation is much more likely to be that the system makes no use of\nsemantic information, other than possibly implicitly via training. It is this issue, rather than any\nother, that has constrained progress in this area.\n\nSummary:\nI enjoyed the paper, in part because of the controversial claims it makes, but mostly because it\ntakes on a difficult problem in an imaginative way. That said, I feel the authors would do themselves and\nthe field much great justice if they were to resist their claims. I strongly recommend looking at some\nreal drawings, ideally \u201cin the flesh\u201d - and not just manga images of 3/4 faces, heavily cropped, drawn\nwith short quadratic curves of uniform width and density, on a perfectly flat surface.\n\nThe paper lacks any experiment, which was once common but is far less so now. One obvious\nexperiment is to conduct some kind of Turing test, of which there are many variants in the NPR/NST\nliterature (especially the more recent). As it stands the paper lack rigour - a rigour which I suspect would\nlead the authors to question some of their more controversial (for me) claims.\n\nThe paper makes a contribution and is publishable."

                        "value": "Thank you for your detailed comments!\n\n**(R3-1) Introduction**  \nThanks, we have now revised the introduction to remove subjective claims. Our main point is that the vector format is not only a scalable alternative for a raster format, but it also allows us to model additional information lost in the raster representation: that of each drawing and sketch being a collection of individual strokes. Such representation enables more fine-grained editing taking the artwork creation process into account. Please do inform us if this is now more accurate than previously stated \u2014 it certainly was not our intention to overclaim! \n\n**(R3-2) Additional references**\n\nWe focus our discussion on recent papers as the focus of our paper is on deep generative approaches for vector graphics. We are happy to provide a more extensive discussion of other related topics if reviewers think that this will benefit the paper's exposition.\n\n**(R3-3) The use of quadratic curves to represent strokes (strokes complexity)**\n\nFirst, we would like to stress that, theoretically, SRM has no restriction on the exact stroke model to use. The reason why we used quadratic Bezier curves is that the method used to create vector sketches produces fairly simple strokes, and quadratic Bezier curves are more than enough to model strokes in the training set. \n\nTo show that our model supports Bezier curves of a high degree (can represent more complex strokes), we train on the sketches from the QuickDraw dataset with Bezier curves with 15 control points.\nWe added Figure 17 to the Appendix which shows that our model can flawlessly support more complex curves.\n\n**(R3-4) Additional stroke parameters\n(Same as R2-3)**\nThanks, great suggestion. While we leave extensive evaluation of adding additional properties to strokes to future work, as a proof of concept, we experimented with adding line thickness to a set of control point positions, describing each stroke. A newly added Figure 16 in the supplemental shows that our model manages to leverage line thickness as well and represents eyelashes with thicker lines, showcasing flexibility in our approach. \n\n**(R3-5) Results view angles and classes**\n\nThe short answer is the results simply reflect the training data. We train only on the dataset of faces. But of course, our method is agnostic to the exact nature of data, as long as they can be categorized as *complex sketches*.\n\nAdditional results for a different dataset (QuickDraw) are shown in the newly added Figure 17 in the Appendix.\n\n**(R3-6) Generating a sketch of a particular noun class**\n\nEnabling more classes is possible in a naive setting by sourcing a similar dataset where we can readily obtain vectorised training sketches, and training on millions of these sketches. This was however not possible within the rebuttal period, especially recognising our limited computation resources.  Another option could be conditioning our SRM module on feature spaces of large pretrained models and focusing on the transfer learning problem, this is however out of the scope of our work.\n\n**(R3-7) Numerical evaluation** \n\nThanks. We have added a comparison of the FID scores of the generated drawings under different sampling conditions in Section 4.2 Table 1.\n\n**Summary**\n\nGiven the answers 3-6, we expect our model to generalize well to new classes and styles, with stroke design being an area of study moving forward."

The nature of the Set Transformer theoretically guarantees permutation-invariant, so that all the strokes in one sketch can be encoded into a latent code to represent the sketch without worrying about the order of the strokes. This encoder also works even if the stroke number varies among the sketches in the dataset.\n\n2. Also thanks to the Set Transformer, the decoder of the SRM module can sample arbitrary numbers of strokes to constitute a sketch.\n\n3.  Although this paper focuses on the topic of sketch generation. I see the potential of this method to be applied to other artistic styles such as oil painting, just needs to change the stroke model and the dataset."

But you should compare with at least one method related to the topic of sketch generation, even though there may be raster-based such as GANs. \n\n3. There seems to be a flaw in the experiment of section 4.4, figure 8. I can see the sketches corresponding to the interpolated results in Figure 8 (the middle ones) are obviously not in the correct domain. This may be because your interpolation function does not fit this distribution (and I didn't see your interpolation function), which leads to the interpolated latent codes are not on their true distribution\uff08you can analogy the manifold of Swiss Roll)."

Compared with this technique route, what's the advantage of your technique route? Or in other words, do you think directly generating vectors is more prospoective?"

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed feedback and appreciation of our use of the set transformer.\nWe address each question one by one:\n\n**(R2-1)** **The visual quality of the sketches**\nWe focus on *complex vector sketch* generation as a new genre where sketches can have a large number of constituent strokes. We make no assumption about the exact nature of sketches in our theory as long as it fits into the said criteria. However, one needs to take into account the fact that there are no large-scale vector datasets of complex sketches available. The limitation on the visual quality of sketches primarily comes from the training data and the quality of the outputs of the available vectorization methods.\n\n**(R2-2) Bezier curves complexity**\nFirstly, we would like to mention that, even though we used quadratic Bezier curves as a design choice, we never made any hard assumptions about the exact stroke representation in our theoretical setup. To further clarify any doubts, we have now added Figure 17 to the appendix, generating sketches from a model trained on the QuickDraw dataset. In this case, we used Bezier curves with 15 control points (able to represent significantly complex strokes). It can be seen that our model copes well with more complex strokes when the appropriate training data is available.\n\n**(R2-3) Additional stroke parameters**\nThanks, great suggestion. While we leave extensive evaluation of adding additional properties to strokes to future work, as a proof of concept, we experimented with adding line thickness to a set of control point positions, describing each stroke. A newly added Figure 16 in the supplemental shows that our model manages to leverage line thickness as well and represents eyelashes with thicker lines, showcasing flexibility in our set transformer approach. \n\n**(R2-3) Quantitate results**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have added a comparison of the FID scores of the generated drawings under different sampling conditions in section 4.2 Table 1.\n\n**(R2-4) Interpolation results in Figure 8**\nWe agree that the interpolated results in Figure 8 (now Figure 10.) are of lower quality. We however argue that this might not be a limitation of our SRM module but is a result of the lack of training data for the latent generative model. This however should not weaken our main contribution which is complex vector sketch generation. We will now move this Figure to the Appendix and provide a careful discussion around it.\n\n**(R2-5) The advantage of our approach of direct vector sketch generation over raster sketch generation followed by a vectorization step.**\n\nThis is exactly where our method shines! Our approach is very time-efficient, something we believe is critically important for complex vector sketch generation \u2014 it generates a 1000-stroke drawing in just ~0.05 seconds. For comparison, it takes 10-15 seconds to vectorize a raster sketch with the approach we used to prepare the training set. Moreover, being able to generate vector sketches directly has the potential to provide more control over the generation process and editability of the output."

(MAJOR) argues that a set representation is is theoretically possible because  of  `De Finetti General Representation Theorem` which states that for an `exchangeable` set with a pdf for each of it's constituent sets (one realization of the permutation), there exists a pdf that describes all the permutations in the limit.\n2. (MAJOR) presents a practical way to construct this permutation-invariant pdf, so that we can sample sketches from this distribution tractably.\n3. (MINOR) presents a new dataset called `Anime-Vec10k` which which is significanlty more complex than existing datasets (notably QuickDraw!)\n\n---\n\nThe method used to achieve the goal of  \"generating _vector representation of complex sketches_\" is roughly the following:\n1. Consolidate image into sets of bezier-curves.\n2. Use a Set-Encoder to encode the stroke-set to get a latent.\n3. Use a VAE loss to regularize the space of latents.\n4. Use an MLP based conditioning denoising network to get from (500/1000) _random_ strokes to the actual strokes.\n5. The important point in point 4 is that **each stroke is considered iid**."

Everything from the introduction on flows logically. The introduction is superb, even though it spends a bit more time describing why `creational` representations matter than I would have liked. The introduction still sets up the problem well - the problem with sequences (ordering and non-scalability of the autoregressive approach) and the problems with using a set approach (variable and unknown cardinality). The related work section is quite comprehensive to me.

                    "value": "While I like the paper, in its current form the paper has many weaknesses:\n\n**(MAJOR): Sampling issues**:\n\n---\n\nThe authors clearly point out that the number of strokes is an issue, but simply brush it away by saying we use 1000 strokes.\nThis is a glaring flaw. What if the sketch is simpler? What happens to the other strokes? Are they duplicated? \n\nThe discussion in Appendix E is is simply not enough to provide a solution.\n\n**(MAJOR): Matching issues/ iid assumption of strokes **:\n\n---\n\nRelated to sampling is the issue of matching. In the diffusion model equation (3), you simply decompose the sketch into iid strokes. This is a **VERY** strong assumption. I do not see how during sampling, one cannot get a degenerate solution of just repetetively denoising into the same stroke. There is no question asked about how the iid sampling affects the proposed pipeline.\n\nIn the same way, how is the sequence $\\mathbf{s}$ generated at training time? Do you let the randomness of the random strokes take care of matching the proper final stroke? Why is there no hungarian matching? Assuming normalized coordinates in $[-1, 1] \\times [1, 1]$ , how does it make sense for the denoising network to take a random stroke at (-1, -1) and try to denoise it to (1,1), instead of just recognizing (with hungarian matching) or simple euclidean distance that it is much easier to denoise the stroke closer to the final location?\n\n**(MAJOR):  Sequence representation/Sequence lengths**\n\n---\n\nIt is not clear at a first glance (unless I am wrong) that the paper does the following:\n1. Takes in a **variable** number of input strokes\n2. Generates (denoises) a **fixed** (1000) number of output strokes.\n\nThe motivating factor of the paper, and the way the paper is currently written suggest that the model is capable of generating a variable number of strokes. It seems that is not possible\n\n**(MAJOR) No quantitative results**\n\n---\n\nI said previously that the paper has missing citations. I will mention the actual links later but describe them here:\n\nThere has been recent work (<1.5years) in the autoregressive generation area. The work is based on how to make generation permutation invariant which is exactly the problem being tackled here. There are two papers in this area: [Paschalidou] and [Para]. [Paschalidou] use a learnable query vector that looks at the previously generated sequence and predicts the next one. [Para] uses a set encoder and a sequence decoder with mask tokens to perform controled generation.\n\nThe authors do not cite these papers. The authors have no baselines as they (rightfully) claim that previous work does not scale - but there [Paschalidou] has code available and it would be easily adaptable to their current training regime\n\n[code](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/atiss)\n\nAll you have to do is make each token the sum of its control point embeddings! And then introduce some form of conditioning - either a single condition token or an encoder as done in [Para].\n\nThis should significantly strengthen the paper - we see exactly how slow and underwhelming the other methods are, how slow to sample, what the FID is, and qualitative results as well. I would really like to see those result\n\n**(MINOR)  Few qualitative results**\n\n---\n\nWhile there are a decent number of qualitative results in the paper already - the dataset itslef is small - 10k samples. I would request the authors to **check for overfitting** by also visualziing the closest training set example to each generated sample - this could be in the rgb space as well as some perceptual space - look at the sketch retrieval literature or just VGG features.\n\nAnother thing that will help both analyze the dataset quality and the generation quality is to have a big 10x10 grid from both sets (trainig and generation) somehwere in the paper\n\n**Missing citations**\n\nThe missing citations are \n1. @Inproceedings{Paschalidou2021NEURIPS,\n  author = {Despoina Paschalidou and Amlan Kar and Maria Shugrina and Karsten Kreis and Andreas Geiger and Sanja Fidler},\n  title = {ATISS: Autoregressive Transformers for Indoor Scene Synthesis},\n  booktitle = {Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)},\n  year = {2021}\n}\n2. @inproceedings{10.1145/3588432.3591561,\nauthor = {Para, Wamiq Reyaz and Guerrero, Paul and Mitra, Niloy and Wonka, Peter},\ntitle = {COFS: COntrollable Furniture Layout Synthesis},\nyear = {2023},\nseries = {SIGGRAPH '23}\n}"

                        "value": "Thank you for a very detailed review, *particularly* your appreciation of the challenging and forward-looking nature of the problem we solve, and our idea of using a set representation approach to model vector graphics.\n\nBelow we answer each question one by one.\n\n---\n\n**Strokes sampling during inference**\n\nSRM (Set Reconstruction Module) is trained on sketches with a variable number of strokes, thanks to the arbitrary sum (i.e. $\\sum_{\\mathbf{s}\\in \\mathcal{S}}$) present in the true likelihood in Eq(3). Our SRM is conditioned on a latent vector, and at inference time, we can indeed generate any number of strokes. However, this is a parameter that has to be set manually. In Section 4.2 we discuss what happens when we vary the number of strokes during generation, and Figure 4 shows the results with varying numbers of strokes. For the results in the paper (unless specified otherwise), we generated 1000 strokes per sketch as we found it to produce good results. Since we assume that strokes are IID, we need to sample more strokes than the average cardinality of sketches in the training set (in Anime-Vec10k, there are 305 strokes per sketch on average). We discuss in detail in Section 4.2 oversampling and under-sampling.\n\n**Assumption of IID strokes:** \n\nWe do not claim that strokes are independent \u2014 the strokes are indeed correlated in their true sense. However, we use the fact that the strokes are conditionally independent given a set representation (i.e. a compact latent code), powered by De-Finetti\u2019s Theorem. The implication of this is that conditioned on a latent set representation, our SRM model will not result in a degenerate solution.\n\n**How is the sequence $\\mathbf{s}$ generated at training time:**\n\nThanks, but there might be a misunderstanding here. We provide below clarifications on our interpretation of the question \u2014 \n*\u201cIn the same way, how is the sequence generated at training time? Do you let the randomness of the random strokes take care of matching the proper final stroke? Why is there no Hungarian matching? Assuming normalized coordinates in [-1,1]x[1,1], how does it make sense for the denoising network to take a random stroke at (-1, -1) and try to denoise it to (1,1), instead of just recognizing (with Hungarian matching) or simple Euclidean distance that it is much easier to denoise the stroke closer to the final location?\u201d.* Please do get back if this is incorrect \u2014 we will endeavor to respond promptly.  \n\nFirst and foremost, we *do not* deal with sequence representations.  Each stroke is a 6-dimensional vector, as described in the beginning of Section 3.\nAlso, we *do not* match strokes explicitly during training. During training, for each noise level, we pass to our MLP the noisy strokes (noisy control points, essentially) with added noise corresponding to the given noise level, and the latent code representing the set. Our MLP is simply trained to return a noise estimation per stroke, conditioned on the set representation. The simplicity of the SRM formulation is that it can simply be seen as training any other conditional diffusion model where the set latent is the condition and the strokes of one sketch as IID data points.\n\n**Numerical comparisons**\n\nThanks. We have added a comparison of the FID scores of the generated drawings under different sampling conditions in Section 4.2 Table 1.\n\n**Additional references**\n\nThanks for the additional references!\nWe added a discussion of additional works to a revised introduction.\n\n**Additional qualitative results** \n\nThanks for the suggestions! We have added additional qualitative results in Figure 7 and Figure 12 as well as examples of the training data in Figure 13.\n\n**Figure 5: Why does the DDPM sampler seem to have more strokes than the DDIM sampler? or are the strokes just placed closer together in the DDIM sample?**\n\nAll samples generated in Figure 5 have the same number of generated strokes. Since DDPM sampling is stochastic, there is more diversity in stroke positioning. In DDIM sampling (which is deterministic), strokes are positioned so closely that it is hard to see that there are multiple strokes on top of each other. In Figure 15 in the Appendix, we reduce stroke width to better show the alignment between strokes for the DDIM sampling method.\n\n**Do you plan to release the dataset?**\n\nYes, most definitely \u2014 this is a dataset that (we think) is much needed to progress the sketch community in terms of studying complex sketches. We will also release the code as well."
