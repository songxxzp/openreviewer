                    "value": "- I am not quite convinced by the experimental results. Specifically, Figure 5 and the subsequent remark indicate that \"sinkhornDRL achieves better performance across almost half of the considered game\". However, it might be possible that both QRDQN and MMD each excel in roughly 50% of the games over the other. Consequently, sinkhorn should, on average, surpass either of the two in 50% of the games, as Sinkhorn essentially interpolates between these two algorithms. Observing Table 3 seems to draw the same conclusion: when Sinkhorn outperforms QRDQN, it often falls to MMD; conversely when it outperforms MMD, it tends to underperform relative to QRDQN. However, I admit that this is not absolute, as there are indeed some games where Sinkhorn surpasses both. But my concern is whether \"better performance across half of the games\" is enough.\n\n- The kernel assumed in the theoretical part (e.g., theorem 1) is different from that used in the experiments (the Gaussian kernel). So I am not sure how are the theory and the experiments connected.\n\n- There seem to be some related works that are missed. I'm not sure if all of them are relevant, but the author can check if they are related. Some remarks are attached to each of them.\n\n  - Li, Luchen, and A.

They claimed that it is an interpolation between Wasserstein distance and MMD, and thus, I am wondering why it is expected to be better.  It would be great if the authors could provide a more either rigorous or intuitive explanation.\n\n- The author proposed to generate finite samples to approximate the distribution (algorithm 1). Hence, I think a question is how large the statistical error will be, i.e., what is the error incurred when learning from finite samples, as compared to learning from the true distribution? Furthermore, how do these errors accumulate within an MDP? This may be a bit beyond the scope of this paper, but it will be interesting to see how statistically robust sinkhorn divergence is to finite samples intuitively."

                        "value": "Thank you for taking the time to review our paper. We appreciate your comments and feedback, and we would like to address the concerns you raised in your review.\n\t\n>Q1 in Weakness: I am not quite convinced by the experimental results...\n\t\t\n**A:** Let us summarize relevant results based on Table 3 to clarify your concerns. **Among 26 (22) games where SinkhornDRL outperforms QRDQN (MMDDRL), Sinkhron still performs better than MMDDRL (QRDQN) on 12 of them**.  Therefore, it is not sufficient to directly think that SinkhornDRL outperforms one and at the same time is inferior to the other. Generally speaking, although we can observe better performance on half of the games, the number of games on which a certain algorithm is superior to the others is only one of the important metrics to evaluate the capability of RL algorithms. We argue that the **Mean, Interquartile Mean(IQM), and median are shown in Table 2 and the learning curves in Appendix D are also very informative and more commonly used**. Table 2 showcases SinkrhornDRL is a generally better or competitive algorithm, and all learning curves in the Appendix substantiate that our algorithm is significantly better than the others in many games and competitive in the remaining ones.\n\t\n>Q2 in Weakness: The kernel assumed in the theoretical part (e.g., theorem 1) is different from that used in the experiments (the Gaussian kernel). So I am not sure how are the theory and the experiments connected.}\n\t\n**A:** We would like to clarify that the kernels **are the same used in the theoretical part and experiments, which are consistent**. Concretely, Theorem 1 demonstrates that the Bellman operator is contractive when we use the unrectified kernel in Sinkhorn divergence, while the Gaussian kernel cannot guarantee the contraction, which coincides with the MMDDRL paper. As mentioned in the **Hyperparameter Setting** in the Experiment, we still use the unrectified kernel in our SinkhornDRL algorithm, and therefore our theory and algorithm are consistent.\n\t\n>Q3 in Weakness: There seem to be some related works that are missed. I'm not sure if all of them are relevant, but the author can check if they are related. }\n\t\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out these related works and we have cited them appropriately in the revised paper. Here we give our discussion.\n\t\n* [1] is a Bayesian version of the distributional RL algorithm based on Wasserstein Variational Inference.\n* [2] TV can dominate (as an upper bound) many metrics, including Wasserstein distance, however distributional Bellman operator is not contractive over TV [10]. This is why the theoretical results in the infinite horizon setting in [2] used average Wasserstein distance rather than TV.\n* [3] is the first to study the advantages of distributional RL algorithms on the offline setting by imposing a conservative penalty term with the contraction guaranteed by Wasserstein distance.\n* [4] is an extension paper of QR-DQN to prove the convergence of quantile TD in the TD learning setting instead of the dynamic programming setting by leveraging the non-smoothness analysis and new stochastic approximation theory. Akin to QR-DQN, in the first step our paper focuses on the contraction property in the dynamic programming setting and similarly we can also leave an extension paper to prove the TD learning under Sinkrhon divergence as future work. One thing we want to add here is that the TD learning under MMD and Sinkhorn is based on samples, whose convergence is supposed to be more easily guaranteed via the standard stochastic approximation theory than the quantile TD. We leave more rigorous analysis as the extension work in the future."

                        "value": ">Q1 in Questions: However, it is still unclear to me why the authors proposed to use sinkhorn divergence. They claimed that it is an interpolation between Wasserstein distance and MMD, and thus, I am wondering why it is expected to be better.\n\t\n**A:** The interpolation nature of Sinkhorn divergence helps it to **enjoy the advantages of both Wasserstein distance and MMD**, and thus the corresponding distributional RL algorithms are more likely to perform better in many environments. As mentioned in the second paragraph in the Introduction, compared with Wasserstein distance, \n* Sinkhorn divergence makes the computation of Wasserstein distance **tractable** by adding entropic regularization to overcome the curse of dimensionality issue, especially in the multi-dimensional reward function setting of RL, instead of using the quantile regression to approximate. It thus naturally avoids the non-crossing issue in quantile-based algorithms.\n* Sinkhorn divergence uses the KL regularization to **encourage a \"smoother\" transport plan**, where the points are less tightly coupled to their specific targets in the optimal transport plan. This property is particularly beneficial in generating samples to approximate the current return distribution or in generative models, **ensuring that the generated samples cover the return distribution more uniformly**.\n\nWe provide [5-9] for further reference.\n\n>Q2 in Questions: The author proposed to generate finite samples to approximate the distribution (algorithm 1). Hence, I think a question is how large the statistical error will be, i.e., what is the error incurred when learning from finite samples, as compared to learning from the true distribution? \n\t\n**A:** The statistical error is linked with **the sample complexity, i.e., approximating the distance with samples of measures**. We would like to clarify that we have provided the sample complexity results in Table 1 of our original paper, where the sample complexity of Sinkhorn divergence also basically interpolates between Wasserstein distance and MMD. As for how the error accumulated in an MDP, we believe it can be partially explained by the sensitivity analysis in terms of the number of samples. As suggested in the sensitivity analysis results in Figure 3 and Figures 7 and 8 of Appendix H on Breakout, Seaquest, Zaxxon and StarGunner games, a relatively small number of samples used in Sinkhorn can already achieve favorable performance. Based on these observations and the interpolated sample complexity of Sinkhorn divergence, we believe that Sinkhorn divergence is robust to the accumulated statistical errors.\n\t\nWe thank the reviewer once again for the time and effort in reviewing our work! We would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could check our responses and let us know whether they address the raised concerns.

However, I found that SinkhornDRL is worse than both algorithms in more than 20 games in Table 3. Hence, I feel Table 3 doesn't show any advantage of the proposed algorithm; it even shows that SinkhornDRL is slightly worse in the sense that it only wins QRDQN and MMDDRL in 12 games but loses in 20 games.\n\nThe authors also argued that certain metrics of SinkhornDRL are better (eg. Table 2). However, if I understand it correctly, HNS could be biased toward the game that has a larger variance. In other words, the mean of HNS could be high if the proposed algorithm performs extremely well in some game that has a large variance but worse in many other games. I also found that in the fifth column (> human), the proposed algorithm is not the best, suggesting that the above-proposed issue may be true. Hence, I am not sure if Table 2 can outweigh the issue found in Table 3.\n\nI appreciate the authors' response and clarification to my other questions and they generally look good to me. However, my major concern is still the experimental results, as it seems not to show that the proposed algorithm has any obvious advantage over others. Hence I can't change my assessment for this work for now."

In particular, Algorithm 1 suggests the generic SinkhornDRL update, in which the Sinkhorn divergence needs to be evaluated via the differential Sinkhorn iterations in Algorithm 2 we introduced later.  After approximating the Sinkhorn divergence, we directly update the parameters $\\theta$  in the network $Z_\\theta$. Please refer to the full version of the Sinkhorn distributional RL algorithm in Algorithm 3 we just updated.\n\t\t\n>Q3 in Weakness: Section 4.2 has a sequence of theoretical results, while more intuition will be helpful, such as the term $\\overline{\\Delta}(\\gamma, \\alpha)$ in Theorem 1(3) is represented in a very complicated way. So what do these terms mean and how large are they will be more helpful for the readers? So as the relationships to Gaussian or general kernels.\n\t\t\t\t\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out the interpretability issue in Theorem 1 (3). After some small modifications, we have provided a more interpretable version of Theorem 1(3) in the revised version. In particular, we further define a ratio $\\lambda_{\\mu, \\nu}=\\frac{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon - \\varepsilon \\textbf{KL}(\\Pi^*| \\mu \\otimes \\nu)}{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon}$, which **measures the proportion of optimal transport distances regardless of the KL regularization over the whole Sinkhorn distance** $\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon$. Finally, we obtain that the contraction factor has **a convex combination form between $\\gamma^\\alpha$ and 1 with the coefficient $\\inf_{\\mu, \\nu} \\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)$**, where $\\overline{\\Delta}(a, \\alpha) = \\gamma^\\alpha \\inf_{\\mu, \\nu}\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu) + (1-\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu))$ with $\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu) \\in (0, 1]$. The $\\inf_{\\mu, \\nu} \\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)$ characterizes the range of return distribution set in a given MDP, for which we prove that it is strictly greater than 0 and thus  $\\overline{\\Delta}(a, \\alpha) <1$ strictly. **Intuitively, the contraction factor $\\overline{\\Delta}(a, \\alpha)$ is MDP-dependent determined by the tight lower bound of the non-KL term ratio over the whole Sinkhorn divergence**, which is related to the range of the return distribution set.  Please refer to the updated paragraph immediately following Theorem 1 for a more detailed explanation. We have also proofread and updated the proof accordingly.\n\t\t\nMoreover, for the relationships to differential kernels, we discussed them in the following paragraph \"Consistency with Related Theoretical Contraction Conclusions\" after Theorem 1. In particular, the contraction property is only guaranteed under the unrectified kernel $k_\\alpha=-\\Vert x - y \\Vert^\\alpha$, while for the Gaussian kernel, both Sinkrhon divergence and MMD can not guarantee such a contraction property. For instance, the MMDDRL paper points out a counterexample in their paper, demonstrating that MMD with a Gaussian kernel can not guarantee contraction in general."

Firstly, **from the perspective of distributional RL algorithms**, the choice of distributional divergence equipped with density estimation techniques has become the two key factors in designing new algorithms. It is a fact that the most commonly used distributional RL algorithms are based on MMD and Wasserstein distance. Since Sinkhorn has desirable properties, which interpolates the two distances, it is thus theoretically motivated to study the efficacy of Sinkhorn in a distributional RL context. \n\t\nOn the other hand, **from the perspective of the optimal transport field**, since Sinkhorn divergence has been successfully applied to various machine learning models and contexts, including generative models, privacy, and adversarial robustness. It is also motivated to explore the application of Sinkhorn divergence in the RL setting, where we find it is more suitable in distributional RL.\n\t\nAlthough our algorithm is well-motivated, there are still many challenges in designing Sinkhorn-based distributional RL algorithms both theoretically and empirically. Our papers address them comprehensively by proposing technically sound algorithms, studying the contraction property, and conducting extensive experiments for demonstration.\n\t\n>Other small issues\n\t \n**A:** Thanks for pointing out these issues and we have fixed them in the revised version.\n\t\n\t\nWe thank the reviewer once again for the time and effort in reviewing our work! We would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could check our responses and let us know whether they address the raised concerns. We are more than happy to provide further clarification if you have any additional concerns."

                    "value": "The main issues I have with the paper, which I will expand upon\nfurther below, are the following,\n\n1. The writing/organization can definitely use some work -- some parts\n   of the text are awkward to read / not easy to follow.\n2. I have some concerns about the proof of Theorem 1. Ultimately, I\n   believe the claims are correct, but there are some parts that are\n   less clear that should be clarified.\n3. Overall, the math tends to be quite sloppy. There is lots of abuse\n   of notation, some terms are not clearly defined, and that makes\n   some of the steps very difficult to follow (maybe this alone can\n   clarify my concerns about Theorem 1).\n4. Some of the empirical results seem potentially misleading.\n\nSome more explicit details follow.\n\nThe paragraph labeled by \"Advantages over Quantile-based / Wasserstein\nDistance Distributional RL\" is highly unpleasant to read. The \"inline\nbulletpoint\" style is not very easy to follow. Some concepts here are\nnot defined, which limits the utility of this paragraph for motivating\nSinkhornDRL. \n\nRegarding the contraction factor $\\Delta(a,\\alpha)$, it would be nice\nif there was an explicit upper bound given (perhaps in terms of the\nrange of returns). The fact that this term is strictly less than 1\nrelies on some discrepancy between Wasserstein and entropy-regularized\nWasserstein, and it is not intuitive to me how large that discrepancy\nis. Should we expect $\\Delta(\\gamma,\\alpha)$ to be larger or smaller\nthan, say, $\\gamma$ or $\\sqrt{\\gamma}$?\n\nRegarding the empirical results, it is slightly unsettling that Table\n2 reports only the statistics of the \"Best\" scores. In fact, it is not\nactually clear to me what that means.\n\nMoreover, the \"ratio improvement\" figures only show results for games\nwhere SinkhornDRL outperforms its competitors (and the selection of\ngames varies per competitor). The corresponding plots in the Appendix\n(where the human normalized score is shown for each game) shows that\nSinkhornDRL really only outperforms its competitors on roughly half\n(maybe slightly less than half) of the games.\n\n## Proof of Theorem 1\nI don't understand the proof of part 1, and the math is fairly\nimprecise. For instance, the definition of convergence that is\nleveraged between $\\mathcal{W}^{c, \\epsilon}$\nand $\\mathcal{W}^\\alpha$\nis sloppy -- it is being written like as if these are scalar\nfunctions, but they are not. Is the convergence uniform? Also,\nequation (14) does not establish the contraction any better than the\nclaim that $\\mathcal{W}^{c,\\epsilon}\\to\\mathcal{W}_\\alpha$ does, in my\nopinion. You still haven't shown a contraction here. That said, I\nbelieve the claim is true. Same comments for the proof of part 2.\n\nThe correctness of the proof of part 3 relies on a hypothesis that the\noptimal coupling for $W_\\alpha$ and $W^{c,\\epsilon}$ cannot be the\nsame (otherwise, step (b) of equation (21) can be an equality). Is it\nknown that this hypothesis is true? If so, I think this should be\ncited.\n\n## Minor Issues\nIn the last sentence of the \"Quantile Regression (Wasserstein\nDistance) Distributional RL\" paragraph (page 3), \"while naturally\ncircumstances the non-crossing issue\" should probably say \"while\nnaturally circumventing the non-crossing issue\".\n\nIn the output of Algorithm 1, I believe the second argument to\n$\\overline{\\mathcal{W}}^{c,\\epsilon}$ should be $\\{\\mathcal{T}Z_j\\}_{j=1}^N$.\n\nAbove equation (4), \"supreme form of Sinkhorn divergence\" should be\n\"supremal form of Sinkhorn divergence\"."

                        "value": "Thank you for taking the time to review our paper. We appreciate your comments and feedback, and we would like to address the concerns you raised in your review.\n\t\n>Q1: The paragraph labeled \"Advantages over Quantile-based / Wasserstein Distance Distributional RL\" is highly unpleasant to read.\n\t\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this clarity issue. We re-organized this motivation part in the revised paper, by summarizing the advantages over Wasserstein and MMD into two points and one point respectively, and providing relevant references for some undefined concepts, including the non-crossing issue. We invite the reviewer to read and any further suggestion is also welcome.\n\n>Q2: Regarding the contraction factor $\\Delta(a, \\alpha)$, it would be nice if there was an explicit upper bound given (perhaps in terms of the range of returns). The fact that this term is strictly less than 1 relies on some discrepancy between Wasserstein and entropy-regularized Wasserstein, and it is not intuitive to me how large that discrepancy is. .\n \n**A:** This is a great suggestion. We devote ourselves to updating in the rebuttal period and end up with a more interpretable version of Theorem 1(3). In particular, we further define a ratio $\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)=\\frac{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon- \\varepsilon \\text{KL}(\\Pi^* | \\mu \\otimes \\nu)}{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon}$, which measures the proportion of optimal transport distances **regardless of the KL regularization** over the whole Sinkhorn distance $\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon$. It turns out that $\\inf_{\\mu, \\nu} \\lambda(\\mu, \\nu) > 0$ due to a finite ratio set $\\\\{\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)\\\\}$ and a finite return distribution set in a finite MDP (yes, you are right, **the upper bound is explicitly related to the return distribution set**). This further implies that the contraction factor $\\overline{\\Delta}(a, \\alpha) = \\sup_{U, V} \\overline{\\Delta}^{U, V}(a, \\alpha) \\in [\\gamma^\\alpha, 1)$ (less than 1 strictly). Please refer to the updated paragraph immediately following Theorem 1 for a more detailed explanation. We have also proofread and updated the proof accordingly.\n\t\n>Q3: Regarding the empirical results, it is slightly unsettling that Table 2 reports only the statistics of the \"Best\" scores. In fact, it is not actually clear to me what that means..\n\t\n**A:** The best human normalized score is commonly used in (distributional) RL algorithms papers, including QR-DQN, MMD, and IQN. It refers to the highest (or peak) performance achieved by the RL algorithm during its training or evaluation process. The reason why we typically use best scores instead of average or median of scores is that **best scores help to demonstrate the peak capabilities of an RL algorithm**. It also shows what the algorithm can achieve under optimal conditions, which is particularly important in research and development contexts.\n\n>Q4: Moreover, the \"ratio improvement\" figures only show results for games where SinkhornDRL outperforms its competitors (and the selection of games varies per competitor). The corresponding plots in the Appendix (where the human normalized score is shown for each game) show that SinkhornDRL only outperforms its competitors on roughly half (maybe slightly less than half) of the games.}\n\t\n**A:** Since the superiority of typical distributional RL algorithms is more likely to vary across different games, it is thus very important to probe **in which environments our proposed algorithm tends to perform best**.  That is why we focus on the games where our algorithm particularly performs better than others in the ratio improvement figure. To avoid the bias of environment selection in evaluating algorithms, we also provide a comprehensive performance comparison across all games in the Appendix. Although SinkhornDRL performs better than MMD or QRDQN on almost half of the games, **the more valuable and comprehensive metrics, such as mean human normalized score and interquartile mean substantiate that our algorithm is generally better**. This is very intuitive as Sinkhorn divergence can find a sweet trade-off between QR-DQN and MMD, but it does not mean Sinkhorn divergence is overwhelmingly advantageous over QR-DQN or MMDDRL across (most of) all games."

                        "value": ">Q: Proof of Theorem 1 \n\n**A:** We apologize for the confusion generated by some imprecise parts in the proof of Theorem 1 in the Appendix. You are right as the previous proof seems not to have involved a uniform convergence. Therefore, we have corrected the proof accordingly based on some optimal transport literature and notes. In particular, we replaced the proof in the language of $\\epsilon, \\delta$ in both part 1 and part 2 by providing a uniform convergence in the revised version. Please refer to the details in the paragraphs in red in Appendix B.\n\t\nFor part 3, we understand your concern as the minimizers can be the same although it is very unlikely to happen. To remedy this less rigorous proof, we devoted ourselves recently to a more rigorous proof and eventually, we figured out **this discrepancy is stemming from the finite return distribution set in a finite MDP**. This is related to the range of return distribution, coinciding with your comment. In particular, we define a ratio $\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)=\\frac{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon - \\varepsilon \\textbf{KL}(\\Pi^*| \\mu \\otimes \\nu)}{\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon}$, which measures the proportion of optimal transport distances **regardless of the KL regularization** over the whole Sinkhorn distance $\\overline{\\mathcal W} c, \\varepsilon$. It turns out that $\\inf_{\\mu, \\nu} \\lambda(\\mu, \\nu) > 0$ strictly due to a finite set $\\\\{\\lambda(\\mu, \\nu)\\\\}$ with a finite return distribution set in a given finite MDP. We believe this revised proof is more technically rigorous and the insight behind it is more intuitive. Let us know if you have any comments on this point.\n\t\n\t\n>Q: Minor Issues\n\t\nThanks for pointing out these typos, and we have fixed them in the revised paper.\n\t\n\t\n>Q1 in Questions: What is the non-crossing issue?\n\n**A:** In the quantile-based distributional RL, the learned quantile curves can not satisfy the non-decreasing property, especially at the early training stage, leading to **abnormal distribution estimates and reduced model interpretability**[1]. This issue can be largely mitigated by carefully adding the monotonicity constraint, e.g., adding an extra Non-crossing Quantile Logit Network[1]. By contrast, SinkhornDRL uses samples to approximate the return distribution, naturally avoiding this issue related to quantiles.\n\n[1] Non-crossing quantile regression for deep reinforcement learning (Neurips 2020)\n\n>Q2 in Questions: Why is a sample/particle representation \"more flexible\" than modeling quantiles?\n\t\n**A:** Sample representation does not impose any assumption or constraint on the distribution form and can approximate any empirical distribution, no matter how complex, including multi-modal distributions. In contrast, quantile representation typically needs to **pre-specify a fixed number of quantiles and may not capture the full complexity of data**, such as the tail of the distribution, especially when the distribution is complex. For the richness of representation, samples can be viewed as particles that can be moved independently, allowing the model to adapt to any changes in the distribution shape. As opposed to samples, the generated quantile values should satisfy the non-decreasing property, which explains why we need to additionally address the non-crossing issue in quantile-based algorithms. \n\t\n>Q3 in Questions: Why does the RKHS nature of MMD imply failure to capture geometry? RKHS are Hilbert spaces after all.\n\t\n**A:** MMD computes the distance between two probability distributions as the difference in expectations of a function (belonging to the RKHS) evaluated at samples from these distributions. However, this nature causes the limitations of MMD to fully capture the data geometry:\n* **The choice of kernel and resulting RHKS**. MMD needs to pre-specify the kernel, but the common kernels, such as Gaussian, might not adequately capture complex geometrical structures in the data.\n* **Focus on Mean embedding**. MMD computes the difference in the mean embedding of two distributions in RKHS, however, only emphasizing the mean can overlook finer geometry properties of the distribution, including the higher-order moments, and shapes.\n* **Linearity in RKHS**. Since RKHS is a linear space, relying on linearity is also a limitation as the geometric properties of distribution in the high-dimensional setting are more likely to be non-linear. \n\n\t\nWe thank the reviewer once again for the time and effort in reviewing our work! We would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could check our responses and let us know whether they address the raised concerns. We are more than happy to provide further clarification if you have any additional concerns."

                        "value": "Thanks to the authors for their detailed responses and many updates to the draft. I will do my best to go through everything in detail, though admittedly there are lots of changes here and it'll take me some time. I'll start with the most immediate questions.\n\nRegarding the contraction factor, thanks for clearing up the theorem statement (and likely the proof as well, though I have not had the chance to check it carefully yet). I do still find it a little difficult to interpret, though. Firstly, it is now clear to me why you need a finite MDP to make the claim, but this is pretty unusual among contraction arguments for distributional Bellman operators -- for instance, the contraction of the distrbutional Bellman operator wrt Cramer, Wasserstein, or certain MMDs does not require that the MDP is finite. My conclusion from this is that as the MDP state space increases, the contraction factor here can become arbitrarily close to 1, which is a little unsatisfying.\n\nRegarding the \"advantages\" paragraphs, thanks for improving that (same with the clarification about the non-crossing issue). It definitely reads better to me now.\n\nRegarding the geometry of RKHS, I agree that the geometry and learning ability will be highly sensitive to the choice of kernel, but I definitely do not agree with the remainder of your claims on this matter. The \"focus on the mean embedding\" is not restrictive -- MMDs with appropriately chosen kernels are fully able to distinguish probability distributions, including differences in arbitrary moments or statistics (the mean embeddings are infinite-dimensional in general). If your claim here was true, the MMD would assign 0 distance to a pair of distinct distributions, which would violate the axioms of a metric. Likewise, the linearity of the RKHS is not restrictive, as far as I know. Again, MMD is a proper metric (with a characteristic kernel), so the underlying RKHS is rich enough to model distributions. Besides, the dual form of the Wasserstein metric takes a very similar form to the MMD -- the difference is just in the class of witness functions, which is a linear space in both cases.\n\nFurthermore, with respect to the particle representation, I still do not buy the justification for their superior flexibility. As I understand it, for a particle approximation as described in your work, one would have to specify the amount of particles *a priori*, just like the quantiles. Then, the particle and quantile representations would both be representing empirical distributions on $N$ atoms. If anything, I would expect the quantile representation to exhibit more diversity in its support, since in that case we ensure that a wide range of quantiles is captured, as opposed to the particle representation where you can have many particles clustering around a mode of the distribution.\n\nFinally, about the experimental results, thanks for the clarifications. I guess it still comes across to me that the paper is trying to argue that SinkhornDRL is generally better than the competitors, while I think the more correct the statement is that it's generally not worse. I appreciate that your method provides a way to sort of interpolate between existing approaches, but ultimately, you have essentially also introduced a new hyperparameter. Is it actually worth it to tune this hyperparameter? I am not entirely convinced that the answer is \"yes\". That said, I like the contribution mostly for its attempt to answer a question that would otherwise naturally arise among distributional RL researchers (that is, can we learn return distributions with entropically regularized OT)."

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive response and valuable comments on improving our work. Here are our responses.\n\n> Q1: Regarding the contraction factor. .....\n\t\n**A:** As the distributional Bellman operator is at least non-expansive under KL divergence[4], the KL regularized used in Sinkhorn divergence(although it has multiple advantages), is likely to slightly increase the contraction factor for $\\gamma^\\alpha$ to 1. This intuitively explains why the contraction factor under Sinkhorn divergence is in $[\\gamma^\\alpha, 1)$ due to the KL regularized OT nature. Although each contraction factor is strictly less than 1, there are **extreme cases mathematically with non-expansion** as mentioned in our proof. In particular, assuming the contraction factor in the Bellman updating path is $q_k=1-1/(k+2)^2=\\frac{k+1}{k+2}\\frac{k+3}{k+2}$, it turns out that $\\prod_{k=1}^{+\\infty}q_k = \\frac{2}{3}\\frac{4}{3}\\frac{3}{4}\\frac{5}{4}\\cdots=2/3>0$, leading to non-contraction (note it is at least non-expansive). Therefore, a mild assumption is needed to rule out these extreme cases, **although we are all aware that these extreme cases are very unlikely to happen for the contraction factor path in the distributional Bellman updating process for a given MDP**. Therefore, a direct sufficient condition is the finite MDP, which guarantees the contraction factor in such MDP is finite as well as the return distribution set. Thus, $\\inf_{\\mu, \\nu} \\lambda(\\mu,\\nu)$ and would be strictly positive and the resulting $\\sup_{\\mu, \\nu}{\\Delta^{\\mu, \\nu}}$ would be strictly less than 1, leading to the contraction necessarily. A less rigorous statement would be as long as the return distribution set is not sufficiently rich to include the extreme case, our algorithm can be guaranteed for contraction. \n\nOne thing we would like to clarify is that **the finite MDP does not mean as the MDP state space increases, the contraction factor here can become arbitrarily close to 1**. As explained above, the finite MDP is only used to rule out the extreme cases for non-expansion (the product of contraction factors is in $(0, 1)$ instead of 0). It also helps to guarantee rigorous proof, especially for the theory readers in the future. In infinite MDP, the likelihood of these extreme cases would be significantly reduced (even to be zero) due to the infinity nature.\n\t\n\t\n>Q2: Regarding the mean embedding and linearity issue in RHKS.....\n\t\n**A:** Thanks for the clarifications and comments, which are also very helpful for us. We agree the restriction on the mean embedding and linearity may be minor and needs to be a more rigorous investigation in the future. We thus keep the main argument point, i.e., the restrictive geometry from the pre-specified kernel. This is also consistent with the revised version in the \"advantages\" paragraph. \n\t\n> Q3:  Furthermore, with respect to the particle representation, I still do not buy the justification for their superior flexibility....\n\t\n**A:** Thank you for raising this question. It is one of the fundamental issues in distributional RL, which both [1] and [2] ever discussed and favor samples instead of other pre-defined statistics, e.g., quantiles. In summary, learning predefined statistics suffers from two potential drawbacks[1]: **(1) limited statistical representation and (2) difficulty in maintaining the pre-defined statistics**.\n\t\nFor (1), we mostly agree with you that quantile representation may be richer than samples **if the generating samples suffer from the mode collapse issue**. However, **under the same and effective generating mechanism for samples and quantiles with the same $N$ atoms**, we still think samples can be more flexible than quantiles as it is more likely to capture the full shape of the distribution, including multimodality, skewness, and kurtosis.\n\t\nFor (2), the pre-defined statistics method needs to additionally maintain the underlying properties of their pre-defined statistics. For example, **quantile-based methods require that statistics must satisfy the constraints for valid quantile values at specific quantiles**, e.g., the quantile values to be learned are order statistics and the quantiles also to be specified in advance. Therefore, it is deemed the quantile-based algorithm suffers from the non-crossing issue or limited capability. A further notice from [2] is that since in practice we do not observe the environment dynamic but only samples of it, a naive update to learn the predefined statistics using such samples can collapse the approximate distribution due to the different natures of samples and statistics (in fact, [2] proposes imputation strategies to overcome this problem).\n\t\nIn conclusion, **when both samples and quantiles are constructed with the same capability**, samples generally offer greater flexibility and adaptability, making them a preferable choice for approximating distributions in practice."

                        "value": "> Q4:   Finally, about the experimental results, thanks for the clarifications. .... Is it actually worth it to tune this hyperparameter? I am not entirely convinced that the answer is \"yes\". That said, I like the contribution mostly for its attempt to answer a question that would otherwise naturally arise among distributional RL researchers (that is, can we learn return distributions with entropically regularized OT).\n\t\n**A:** Based on our knowledge,  it may be inevitable to incorporate some hyper-parameters in proposing many advanced algorithms. However, **as long as these hyper-parameters can be well controllable, the algorithms are still reliable and useful for deployment in real cases**. From this point, it is worthwhile to tune hyper-parameters especially when we only have a single practical environment, such as the physical world in autonomous driving scenarios, to deploy our algorithms on.\n\t\nWe fully understand your concern if an algorithm inevitably incorporates some hyper-parameters. However, one thing we would to clarify here is that in the sensitivity analysis, we find **SinkhornDRL is less sensitive to hyper-parameters**, e.g., samples, $\\varepsilon$  and $L$, as long as they are not overly large or small. This characteristic aligns with similar Sinkhorn-inspired machine learning methodologies, including SinkhornGAN [3],  which supports the practical application of our algorithms.\n\t\nMore importantly, the performance of our algorithms is applied to **the same hyper-parameters**, e.g., samples, $\\varepsilon$  and $L$, under which our algorithm has already achieved state-of-the-art or competitive performance across all Atari games. A more careful tuning of hyper-parameters would further enhance the performance that we have reported in the paper.\n\t\n\t\nWe express our gratitude to the reviewer for their consistent dedication to reviewing our work. Should this rebuttal address your concerns, we would be grateful for a revised score. Of course, we remain at your disposal for any further clarifications.\n\t\n[1] Nguyen et al.

However, the role of this proposed element is not well explained in the main text. The detailed comments are as follows. The main strength statement in this paper is that Sinkhorn divergence can be useful in the complex environments with high dimensional action space. This discussion is not rigorous, because I cannot find any explanation why the mutual information between two return distribution and the dimension of action space is related.\n\nI also have the following minor concerns.\n\n1. It is hard to get an insight by introducing the Sinkhorn divergence. For example, the paper of MMD DRL provides the figure that explains the propsed scheme can estimate the high order moments better than the existing methods.\n2. The main ablation study (sensitivity anlysis) is provided without any detailed discussion. The authors states taht the property of loss changes as the value of $\\epsilon$ changes in the main theorem, but the empricial analysis and discussion is not provided well. \n3. The experiment protocol in this paper is not standard. Previous works almost conducted in 200M iterations or the authors could have chosen the protocol of the paper, DRL at the edge of statistical precipice to validate the performance.\n4. In table 2 and Figure 2, the propsed method outperforms in terms of mean score but not in median score than baselines, and the proposed method show remarkable performance in venture and sequest. This means that the proposed method is not a generally better algorithm but a specialist for Venture and Sequest. In my point of view, the authors should have stated why the propsee method is better in such envs.\n5. There exists more projection method for distributional RL such as EDRL [A], but the provided baselines is not enough.\n\n\n\n[A] Rowland, Mark, et al. \"Statistics and samples in distributional reinforcement learning.\"\u00a0International Conference on Machine Learning.

We appreciate your comments and feedback, and we would like to address the concerns you raised in your review.\n\t\n> Q: Main concern in Weakness part: The main theoretical contribution can be seen as a simple combination of the architecture of MMD DRL and Sinkorn divergence ... the role of this proposed element is not well explained ... why the mutual information between two return distributions and the dimension of action space is related.\n\t\n**A:** The mutual information in general renders Sinkhorn divergence to interpolate between Wasserstein distance and MMD, finding a sweet spot between their advantages. The mutual information leads to multiple advantages **over Wasserstein distance** summarized as follows. Here, we provide [1-6] for reference.\n* Wasserstein distance suffers from the intractable computation and the curse of dimensionality. This regularization makes the optimization problem (of finding the optimal transport plan) strictly convex and thus **easier to solve**, and thus it significantly reduces computational complexity, allowing the evaluation in the **multivariate setting**, i.e., multi-dimensional reward setting in RL. Also, Sinkhorn divergence transforms the previous quantile-based Wasserstein distance algorithms into a sample-representation way, naturally avoiding the non-crossing issue in quantile-based algorithms and allowing more flexible statistics to represent the return distribution.\n* It helps to find a **\"smoother\" transport plan** compared with the Wasserstein distance, where the points are less tightly coupled to their specific targets in the optimal transport plan or less sensitive to the specific arrangement of sample points.  This also implies that the Sinkhorn divergence can encourage more diverse mappings between distributions, which can be particularly beneficial in generative modeling or return distribution approximation in distributional RL, **ensuring that the generated samples cover the target distribution more uniformly**.\n\t\n\t\n**For our conclusion made in the experiments**, firstly we keep the Wasserstein distance-based QR-DQN, MMDDQN, and SinkhornDRL in the same architecture, including the last output layer (200 quantiles, and 200 samples in MMD/Sinkhorn). As such, the only difference is the choice of distributional divergence equipped with different computation ways over the last layer output. Thus, the properties of distances will be crucial to explain the performance difference. Although we are aware of their different theoretical properties, it is still an open problem to explain which one performs better than others in each environment, which needs more knowledge about each Atari game. Although it is hard to establish the theoretical connection, we did extensive experiments, showing that SinkhornDRL tends to perform best in complex environments with a large action space and complicated environment. This statement is empirical, however, it provides some insight into the impact of different statistical distances with respective properties on real RL algorithms. **The mean and IQM metrics in Table 2 suggest our algorithm is a generally better algorithm than QR-DQN and MMD as Sinkrhorn divergence finds a sweet spot to trade-off their advantages.**\n\n[1] Jean Feydy, Thibault S\u00b4ejourn\u00b4e, Franc\u00b8ois-Xavier Vialard, Shun-ichi Amari, Alain Trouv\u00b4e, andGabriel Peyr\u00b4e.

                        "value": ">Q2 in minor concerns: The main ablation study (sensitivity analysis) is provided without any detailed discussion...\n\t\t\n**A:** We would like to clarify that we have provided a discussion about the sensitivity analysis regarding the varying $\\epsilon$ in the sensitivity analysis part of **Section 5.2**:\n\t\t\nIn practice, a proper $\\epsilon$ is preferable as an overly large or small $\\epsilon$ will lead to numerical instability of Sinkhorn iterations in Algorithm 2, worsening its performance, as shown in Figure 3 (a). This implies that the potential interpolation nature of limiting behaviors between SinkhornDRL with QR-DQN and MMDDRL revealed in Theorem 1 may not be able to be rigorously verified in numerical experiments.\n\t\t\nWe have also conducted this sensitivity analysis on **Seaquest, Breakout, StarGunner, and Zaxxon games**, and have provided more detailed discussion in Appendix H.\n\t\t\n>Q3 in minor concerns: The experiment protocol in this paper is not standard ...\n\t\t\n**A:** As mentioned in the second paragraph of Section 5: Experiment, for a fair comparison, we build SinkhornDRL and all baselines based on a well-accepted PyTorch implementation (https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/DeepRL) of distributional RL algorithms, which has 3k stars. We run 40M frames instead of 200M **for computational convenience, but we report learning curves across all games and detailed scores for trustworthy results in the Appendix**. Although we agree that 200M frames would be stronger, we believe our careful and fair comparison of 40M frames with detailed learning curves and scores based on well-accepted implementation is sufficient for conveying convincing and trustworthy results.\n\t\t\nIn addition, we would like to clarify that we have followed the protocol of the paper DRL at the edge of the statistical precipice to validate the performance. The protocol includes three aspects: \n* **Interval estimation instead of point estimate**. We did so by providing all learning curves with the shading region indicating the standard deviation.\n* **Performance profile/score distribution**. Although we have not provided an explicit score distribution, we have given all the scores across all considered distributional RL algorithms in Appendix F.\n* **Interquartile mean (IQM) apart from mean and median**. We emphasized we have provided IQM results as well as mean, and median in Table 2, which is robust to outlier scores and more statistically efficient than Median.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n>Q4 in minor concerns: Concerns about the outlier scores on Venture and Seaquest games. \n\t\t\n**A:** Firstly, the mean is more statistically efficient than the median, while the median is more robust to outliers. Thus, we have also provided results based on Interquartile Mean(IQM) to balance the efficiency and robustness in Table 2, and IQM results also demonstrate the superiority of our SinkhornDRL. \n\nSecondly, although Sinkhorn stands out in some games, e.g., Venture and Seaquest, **on raw scores, after the human normalization, the proportion of the resulting HMS for these two games is very limited across 55 games**. To provide more empirical details, below we rank all the human-normalized scores for each algorithm, and IQM(5%) removes the first two and last two games. You can check the result, which suggests **the largest scores in the remaining games are of a similar magnitude**. Thus, **our Sinkrhon algorithm is not a specialist for one or two games, but a generally competitive algorithm**.  For example, on the second-best game for SinkhornDRL, SinkhornDRL performs worse than the results on the other baselines' second-best game. (**Note that we average scores over games between Solaris and Demonattack (not included) for IQM(5%)**). However, by averaging all the (95%) games, SinkrhonDRL performs best on both mean (and IQM metrics) and is competitive on the median metric.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n| Human Normalized Score | DQN| C51 |  QRDQN | MMD | Sinkhorn | \n|:----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|\n| Skiing | -146.2|\t-27.3\t| -114.8\t| 0.02 |\t-114.8 |\n| Solaris | -46.8 |\t-23.2|\t-13.9\t| 0.1\t| -15.6 |\n| ...      | ...      |...      |...      |...      |...      |\n| **Seaquest** |18.0\t|25.7\t|36.7\t|50.0\t|**35.0** |\n| ...      | ...      |...      |...      |...      |...      |\n| **Venture** | 55.1 |\t112.1|\t110.3\t|124.7|\t**115.4**|\n| ...      | ...      |...      |...      |...      |...      |\n| Demonattack | 3215.6 |\t21459.5\t| 19126.9\t| 13992.2\t|**10817.7** |\n| Atlantis  |  13063.2 |\t23703.4\t| 36518.4\t| 24193.4\t| 49637.3 |"

                        "value": ">Q5 in minor concerns: Additional baseline about EDRL. \n\n**A:** EDRL is a variant of Quantile-regression DRL by changing the l1-based quantile regression to l2-based expectile regression, showing slight performance on Atari games (Figure 8 in EDRL[A]). Since Sinkrhon divergence interpolates Wasserstein distance, which is directly approximated by quantile regression instead of expectile regression, **QR-DQN, and MMD are the direct baselines to compare SinkhornDRL*. Moreover, as far as we know, as MMDRL is the state-of-the-art algorithm compared with variants of QR-DQN, including IQN and FQF, comparing MMDRL and QR-DQN with SinkhornDRL is sufficient. As also noted in the first paragraph, **proposing a new distributional RL family** and **increasing the model capacity within one family** are the main two research dimensions. Therefore, our research focuses on the first dimension, while directly comparing more theoretically related QR-DQN and MMDRL.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n>Q: Question in Question part: Why reducing the mutual information helps to build a better projection operator.}\n\t\n**A:** By definition, Sinkhorn divergence is to find an optimal transport plan/coupling to minimize the transport costs between two distributions. Given two ground-truth return distributions, mutual information used in Sinkrhon divergence is to **encourage a \"smoother\" transport plan**, where the points are less tightly coupled to their specific targets in the optimal transport plan, compared with Wasserstein distance. This can be particularly beneficial in generating samples to approximate the current return distribution or generative modeling, ensuring that the generated samples cover the target return distribution more uniformly while minimizing the Sinkhorn divergence in terms of the parameterized return distribution $Z_\\theta$. This also explains why Sinkrhon divergence potentially leads to a better projection operator compared with Wasserstein distance. Note that as we use deterministic samples in Sinkhorn divergence, **the updating of the sampling scheme (parameters in $Z_\\theta$) in the current update step while minimizing the Sinkrhon divergence between two given return distributions, would directly affect the generated samples to approximate the return distributions in the next Bellman update**. \n\t\n\nWe thank the reviewer once again for the time and effort in reviewing our work! We would greatly appreciate it if the reviewer could check our responses and let us know whether they address the raised concerns. We are more than happy to provide further clarification if you have any additional concerns."
