That should be moved to Section 3 for clarity.\n\n\n\n2. Section 3.1 second paragraph \"The typical way ...\": While the discussion here refers to only the pooling aspect of deep networks, it overlooks their property of detecting higher-level abstractions. There are multiple feature maps in the layers of deep nets and each feature map detects one type of abstraction. Across multiple feature maps, it can be argued that they learn multiple 'sets' of features and the final task (classification/sequence prediction/anomaly detection) will be a function of the sets of features. Moreover, deepnets can learn the feature map finetuned to the task. In that respect, the proposed algorithm (SINBAD) is limited by the fixed set of histogram projections which cannot be finetuned. For example, such an ability to learn would automatically avoid projections along original axes if they are not discriminative. The point here is that, in theory, there is nothing fundamental about the proposed 'set' based design that a general purpose deepnet cannot do (e.g., for images, ResNet).\n\n\n\n3.

Fine-tuning the histogram feature may indeed result in additional gain and is an exciting direction for future works.\n\n***\u201cthere is nothing fundamental about the proposed 'set' based design that a general purpose deepnet cannot do (e.g., for images, ResNet)\u201d***\n\nWe do not claim that a pre-trained network cannot learn set descriptors in principle, but instead demonstrate how using our method we can create a set descriptor given existing features. As anomaly detection is unsupervised, it is not clear to us that training a large neural network on the normal data will in practice be able to learn effective set features. As our method achieves SOTA results, it can at least serve as a good reference point to the direction the reviewer suggested.  Please note that our approach generalizes well also to time-series features, and is not aimed only at one specific task.\n\n***\u201cDo all set feature dimensions (not their histogram descriptors) need to be the same\u201d***\n\nThey do not all need to be the same.
