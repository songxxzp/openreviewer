                    "value": "This paper proposes a new secret-key encryption scheme based on the idea that LLMs memorize. At a high level, in this approach Alice and Bob both have access to a public LLM but Alice, who wants to send message m to Bob, will find a fine-tuning to the LLM that is based on the secret key k and will allow Bob to extract the planted message m from the fine-tuned model. The idea is that the changes to the model are hidden behind a random projection that is based on the secret key and hence the eavesdropper, at least through an obvious attempt, can not find the information that Bob is able to find and extract the message m.\n\nThe paper also does experimental attacks, trying to break its own scheme, and their best efforts *does* indeed break the proposed scheme. The author(s) plan ideas for future improvements that might resist the attacks."

Encryption is a very subtle task and has its own key parameters, such as the size of the ciphertext and the ability to resists attacks. \n\nThis paper's proposal leads to quite large ciphertexts, and even a \"black-box\" attack based on ML (itself) is breaking the proposed scheme. So I don't see why this proposal might actually lead to a useful scheme.\n\nI also believe a new proposal for encryption should be submitted to a cryptography venue to get proper checks, not a learning venue. And in doing so, the presentation should be fully accessible to crypto audience, not written the way it is, with fully clear exposition of the assumptions, tools, notions, etc, so that the crypto community can fully understand and review the new proposal for encryption.\n\nI would be more lenient if the proposal was a public key scheme, for which the crypto community is much more interested in new proposals. But to me, the bar for proposing a new secret key scheme is way higher."

What does \"encrypt them\" in step 2 of your re-framed game is done? which one of m_0 or m_1 is encrypted?**\nEncrypt both $m_0$ and $m_1$ to form a set of examples ${(c_i, m_i)}^t_{i \\in \\{0, 1\\}}$. Then the training set is a set of ciphertexts with binary labels, 0 or 1, indicating which message produced the ciphertext. Since encryption is not deterministic, the ciphertexts will all be different.\n\nWe apologize for the typo and will fix it. \n\n**in page 7 and 8, you say that \"operating on bit sequences\" is a factor that limits previous crypto-analysis approaches. But is not it that without loss of generality? As far as I understand, everything can be re-written in zeros and ones.**\nYou are again correct. Because existing encryption algorithms operate on bit sequences, existing cryptanalyses also look for bit-level patterns. We could apply them to our ciphertexts, but we think the lack of bit-level operations would make these analyses unlikely to work. We will correct this language in future versions."

Although the proposed method is based on a random project, Pk is just linear transformations such as a combination of orthogonal matrices and diagonal matrices. The activation function may act as a non-linear transformation, but this is unclear from the algorithm description. Since this structure is similar to the primary design principles of existing block ciphers, conventional cryptanalysis methods may also be applied by adapting to the domain. However, this has not yet been attempted in this paper. Instead, the IND-CPA game was modified to fit the classification problem. Nevertheless, looking at the presented simulation results, such as Fig. 4, the distinguishability between two distributions is far from negligible in all three cases. Therefore, it seems to be evidence that it is not secure."

The authors have presented a rigorous analysis of  (intuitive) security provided by the proposed crypto-system. \n\n4. Authors have also shown how the security of SELM can be improved using various regularization techniques."

Lack of discussion on how the proposed method stacks up against traditional crypto methods like MPC (such as extended oblivious transfer or VOLE) regarding communication and computation requirements. In particular, a discussion on the tradeoffs between message length, ciphertext size, and compute and communication requirements.\n\n\n**In summary, while the contributions are novel, the scalability of the proposed crypto-system is questionable, especially as an alternative to the existing crypto-primitives such as homomorphic encryption and MPC**.  Moreover, the challenge of transmitting messages securely is not new and is largely considered resolved, especially when contrasted with the complexities of performing computations on encrypted data (e.g, using homomorphic encryption).  I'm open to increasing the score, provided critical concerns are addressed."

We\u2019d like to answer your questions as best we can.\n\n**Can we further improve memorization speed using Prompt engineering strategies?**\nMost likely, yes. We perform some experiments in Appendix B on this and find that the UUID prefix leads to the best memorization speed; we think this is because it \u201cresets\u201d the LM context.\n\n**What attack vectors or cryptanalyses are the biggest threats to SELM security?**\nIn our experiments, gradient-boosted decision trees do the best on the security game. However, we\u2019re aware that our security experiments are not as rigorous as the decades of attacks on existing algorithms like AES and we expect there to be more attacks that are stronger against SELM.\n\n**Can we employ off-the-shelf LLM optimization techniques to reduce the computation burden of the SELM without compromising its security guarantee?**\nYes! We think that FlashAttention is an example of an LM optimization that was released during this work and would likely lead to improved wall clock memorization speed. This is part of why we\u2019re excited about SELM: we can take advantage of LM optimizations and apply them for free to SELM.\n\n**What are the key (potential) backdoors in LLM to undermine the security of SELM?**\nWe\u2019re not aware of any backdoors in LLMs that would undermine the security of SELM, but we agree that it\u2019s an interesting area for further work."
