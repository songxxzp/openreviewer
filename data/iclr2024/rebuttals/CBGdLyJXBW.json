The authors derive the back propagation algorithm for the proposed architecture (in broad strokes), and show (theoretically) that the proposed model is expected to have steeper gradients, which the authors associate with faster convergence. Experiments are conducted on MNIST dataset variations, where the proposed model has a favourable training profile."

                    "value": "**Originality:** The paper proposes an MLP architecture with self- and neighbourhood-connections within a layer. According to the literature review done by the authors, this is the first instance of such an architecture being proposed. Authors do compare their model to classic RNNs, and I would have appreciated a deeper discussion on the parallels. Either way, I am convinced that the idea is novel.\n\n**Quality:** The authors give some theoretical backing to the rapid convergence claims, which is appreciated.\n\n**Clarity:** The paper is clearly written and very easy to follow.\n\n**Significance:** I believe a broader benchmarking experiment is needed to determine the significance. However, it is nice to see a simple and elegant idea proposed."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "**Benchmarking experiments:** The authors have chosen MNIST and its variations for benchmarking. The choice seems very unobvious: these are image datasets, with lots of \u201credundant\u201d inputs (e.g. pixels that are white for all digits). A fully-connected architecture should rather be applied to a selection of classification and regression tasks where at least some of the input variables are mutually independent. Why not take a random pick from: https://github.com/EpistasisLab/pmlb\n\n**Hyperparameters:** It seems that the same learning rate was used for both the proposed architecture and the standard MLP. This seems inappropriate: log-likelihood (cross-entropy) loss yields higher gradients than the mean squared loss, as such one usually picks smaller learning rate value for cross-entropy. The comparison between architectures will only be fair if the hyperparameters are optimised separately for each, the proposed model and the MLP.\n\n **Formatting:** The authors do not always adhere to correct formatting standards. A few grammatical mistakes are present in the paper. Please see below for the suggested list of corrections:\n\n\u201cdisconnected from biological reality. (Akomolafe, 2013).\u201d - please remove the full stop prior to the reference.\n\n\u201cmodel depicted a noticeable increase\u201d - model exhibited\n\n\u201cWhile Hopfield use\u201d - While Hopfield used\n\n\u201cUNet++(Zhou et al., 2018), \u201c - add a space in front of the bracket \n\n\u201cThough the forward propagation mechanism of the proposed model echoes the forward propagation mechanism of conventional RNNs, in conventional RNNs, the activations of the hidden neurons, obtained from the prior time step, are used to calculate the output of the hidden layer, whereas in CHNNet, the current pre-activations of the hidden neurons are used to calculate the output of the hidden layer.\u201d - this sentence is too long, please break it up into three separate sentences.\n\n\u201cequation 3 and equation 4\u201d - Equation (3) and Equation (4)\n\nI suggest that the contributions are listed in present tense."

                    "value": "*\u201cthe difference between the cost of CHNNet, generated at two sequential time steps, is greater than that of the conventional FNN; that is, CHNNet converges faster than the conventional FNN.\u201d* \u2014 is this really a valid statement? From the loss landscape perspective, a higher difference in loss values implies \u201csteeper\u201d gradients. Whether or not that would lead to faster convergence is not easily answered, in my opinion. With very steep gradients one might experience higher oscillations and stronger sensitivity to the learning rate value. I think the authors should only state what they know for certain: that the proposed approach provably yields higher gradients (which may lead to faster convergence).\n\nThe p-values show that the difference in performance is not statistically significant for the proposed model and the MLP. What about convergence speed? Can that be quantified and statistically evaluated for significance? Also, what about runtime efficiency\u2014in absolute terms, when the number of parameters is comparable, which architecture is quicker to train? Please evaluate/comment on this."

Below, we address each question and concern in a point-by-point fashion:\n\n#### **Weaknesses:**\n- Benchmarking experiments: We had conducted additional experiments on the Abalone, Iris, Boston Housing, and Breast Cancer datasets and got similar results to those shown in the paper. However, due to page restrictions, we could not add the results to the paper.\n\n- Hyperparameters: Regarding the hyperparameters, our hypothesis was that because of the set of weights referred to as $w_2$ in the paper, the model should outperform FNN in complex datasets. We had conducted additional experiments and concluded that CHNNet outperformed FNN in complex datasets like the FMNIST and EMNIST datasets.\n\n- Formatting: We will follow the suggested formatting in the camera-ready version of the paper if it gets accepted.\n\n#### **Questions:**\n- We will state the suggested statement about the steeper gradient in the camera-ready version of the paper if it gets accepted.\n- The p-values show that the difference in accuracy gained by the models is not statistically significant in many cases. However, our main goal was to get faster convergence than FNN, and in some experiments, we also got performance gains compared to FNN. Further, with an equal number of parameters in CHNNet and FNN, the number of computations per epoch is nearly equal as well. Thereby, the training time for CHNNet and FNN with an equal number of parameters will be nearly equal as well."

                    "value": "This paper proposes what is claimed to be a more robust model of artificial neural networks where the hidden neurons, residing in the same hidden layer, are inter-connected thus leading to an increase in convergence, when compared to feed-forward neural networks.\n\nThis is an interesting idea, inspired by the lateral connections omnipresent in the neural systems of primates, and in fact responsible for the center-surround motif in the retina. However, the mathematical formulation of the recurrence thus occurring in the networks seems incorrect, and equivalent to a feed-forward neural network. In more detail, the proposed formulation for a layer l is as follows:\n\n    A(l) = f(Z(l))  where  \n        Z(l) =  W1(l) A(l-1) + W2(l) H(l) + B(l)   \n        H(l) = W1(l) A(l-1) + B(l)\n\nwhere A(l) is the output of layer l, f is the activation function, and H(l) are the horizontal connections (Equations 1-3, on Page 3). However, by replacing H(l) with its definition one obtains:\n\n    Z(l) =  (W1(l) + W2(l) W1(l)) A(l-1) + W2(l) B(l) + B(l) \n          = W3(l) A(l-1) + B3(l)\n\nHence, the result is a classic feed forward computation unit of the form:\n\n        A(l) = f(Z(l))  where \n            Z(l) = W3(l) A(l-1) + B3(l)\n\nHence, by trying to avoid the recursion inherent in the lateral inhibition network, by taking the \"hidden output\" to be what the unit would generate as output in the absence of horizontal connections, leads to a network that is in all respects equivalent to a feed-forward network.\n\nIt might be the case that this partitioning of the computation leads in some cases to a faster convergence, but in this case the authors have to make a better case for the way in which the mathematically correct recurrent formulation is replaced with a feed-forward variant."

If you compose linear transformations, you get a linear transformation. Specifically, if you put equation (2) in equation(1), you will get a new linear transformation that is similar to using no intra-hidden layer connection.  \n\n\n(2). I think the experiments are insufficient:\n\nThe number of training epochs before convergence does not give the full picture. The claim of rapid convergence fails to account for the overhead per epoch due to the extra intra-layer computations. Also, I think the authors should compare this work with the use of skip connections. \n\n:"

Below, we address each question and concern in a point-by-point fashion:\n\n#### **Weaknesses:**\n- We omitted experiments with skip connections, as skip connections can be added to both CHNNets and conventional FNNs. As a result, skip connections can benefit both CHNNets and FNNs equally.\n\n#### **Questions:**\n- The proposed architecture is in fact a conventional FNN with intra-connected hidden layers. The novelty of the model lies in the introduction of a new set of weights, responsible for the rapid convergence as discussed in section 3.3 of the paper, and the approach used to connect the hidden neurons.\n- With an equal number of parameters in CHNNet and FNN, the number of computations per epoch is nearly equal as well. Additionally, in section 4.4, we conducted experiments with CHNNet and FNN having nearly equal numbers of parameters and showed that CHNNet outperformed FNN in such setups as well."

They also acknowledged the potential comparison issue that self-connections result in more parameters, and performed another raft of experiments which normalized for parameter count between traditional and CHHNet architectures, and showed continued increased convergence for CHHNets even in that setting."
