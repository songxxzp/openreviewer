LSM is added as an additional method (see results section for more details). Additionally, Geo-FNO and Geo-LSM are added as an upgrade for FNO and LSM models for performing experiments on the added irregular grid datasets.\n\n**Appeal to the reviewer:** With the additional experiments, results, and explanations, we now hope the reviewer finds the manuscript suitable for publication. Accordingly, we request you to raise the score for the manuscript. Please do let us know if there are any further queries."

Related work: it would be beneficial for the authors to relate to existing code alternatives and or attempts to study data-driven models. For example, DeepXDE (lu et al. 2021) is a code package that contains most of the components of CoDBench and further allows more flexibility in terms of data construction. \n3. Overall contribution: the authors present as major contributions the analysis of Super-resolution as well as out-of-distribution tasks (stress and strain) however both are presented in earlier works for studying data-driven models and benchmarked against baselines (e.g. Fanaskov et al. 2022 and Rashid et al. 2022). Hence while it is beneficial to analyze these at a broader scale over all 11 models the scope of this contribution is limited. Following this, the key insight, limitations, and future work suggested appear minimal in terms of scope and practicality.\n4. Minor: Figure 1 is never referenced. It will be beneficial to change the coloring of optimal values in tables and or underline the second best to have better discrimination between second and third."

We have now included detailed description about how to use the package. Working examples in form of run scripts are also included. Further reference to the run_scripts is included in the ReadME File. These additional information will allow readers and users to directly use the models and datasets to train and evaluate the architectures for different tasks.\n\n*Related work: it would be beneficial for the authors to relate to existing code alternatives and or attempts to study data-driven models. For example, DeepXDE (lu et al. 2021) is a code package that contains most of the components of CoDBench and further allows more flexibility in terms of data construction.*\n\nResponse: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that extensively evaluates most of the existing architectures for dynamical systems.

We would like to highlight that CoDBench is directly comparable with DeepXDE as the former is a benchmarking paper, while the latter focuses on data generation, domain formulation, etc., as the reviewer outlines. The present work, CoDBench, is submitted as a benchmarking paper under the topic ``datasets and benchmarks'' in the ICLR paper track (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers). Accordingly, we respectfully disagree with the comparison that the reviewer has made. \n\nThe aim of the table, which was included based on the Reviewer's recommendation, was to show the exhaustive nature of CoDBench in benchmarking models; the present work benchmarks 12 models, while the next best work in the literature benchmarks only 5 models. We thank the reviewer for acknowledging this aspect. \n\nIt should also be noted that based on the reviewer's comments, we have now added additional experiments on **irregular grids**, new models (LSM, geo-LSM, and geo-FNO), and superresolution. With these, we hope the reviewer finds the manuscript suitable for ICLR as a benchmarking paper. \n\nSince we are into the last few hours of author-reviewer discussion, we request the reviewer to raise any outstanding concerns. Otherwise, we earnestly request the reviewer to evaluate the paper for what it is and raise the score appropriately. Your support in this final phase, particularly if you find the revisions satisfactory, would be immensely appreciated!\n\nThank you!"

Yet, such a paper can define an interesting milestone of the field depending on the release and quality of the code and dataset provided alongside the paper.*\n\n**Response:** We would like to bring to the attention of the reviewer is that this work is aimed at benchmarking the architectures for simulating dynamical systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only work that extensively evaluates most of the existing architectures for dynamical systems. While prior research, limited to [2], has not explored architectures beyond a certain scope, our evaluation includes 12 distinct architectures. Notably, existing literature typically assesses no more than five or six architectures. To provide a comprehensive perspective in comparison to both benchmarking studies and repositories featuring implementations for various neural operators, we have introduced Table 9 in the Appendix. This table provides a comparative analysis between our work and existing literature, specifically focusing on architectural considerations.\n\n[2] CFDBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Machine Learning Methods in Fluid Dynamics. (Arxiv: 13th September 2023)\n\n*What training methodology is used for each algorithm ? I find section 2.3 quite general and it is difficult to understand what physical quantity is estimated / trained on by each algorithm.*\n\n**Response:** To clarify this point, we have now included an additional table (Table 6) in the appendix that specifies the input and output physical quantity associated with each of the dataset.\n\n*Can the authors comment on the limitation of their study for the ood evaluation. PDEs solution can exhibit very different behavior with the same equation varying the initial condition, notably for fluid dynamics data. Such a test could strengthen the analysis proposed by the authors.*\n\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The PDEs can indeed exhibit very different behavior based on the boundary conditions set, especially for fluid dynamics data. Even though, we have added an out-of-distribution generalization task in terms of strain-stress datasets, Adding more experiments by varying the boundary conditions and studying the behavior of each model and the ability to generalize can indeed give further helpful insights. We have added this in the limitations section (Appendix G). \n\n*The error in the super resolution settings seems to explode. Can the authors comment on the results they report in the paper ?*\n\n**Response:** We have now added additional experiment testing the super-resolution capability of models on the strain dataset (see Tab. 5). Based on the results on both the datasets we have added additional insights on why such behavior is seen during super-resolution.\n\n*While it is very difficult to be exhaustive in such a study, testing all the literature is unfeasible, I strongly encourage the authors to include an extensive discussion on why they chose the selected models or at least why they chose not to select other models. Such a discussion would be a valuable addition to the paper.*\n\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and have added an extensive discussion on how models are selected. We have also added discussion about some of the models that have given good results but couldn't be included in the study as part of limitations.\n\n**Appeal to the reviewer:** With the additional experiments, results, and explanations, we now hope the reviewer finds the manuscript suitable for publication. Accordingly, we request you to raise the score for the manuscript. Please do let us know if there are any further queries."

I am not sure if I missed this, the discussion on performance/adaptability of different models on irregular grids is not included. I found the overall analysis and insights comprehensive but also a little bit simple with missing key discussion on a simulation where irregular grids are required.*\n\n**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this invaluable suggestion. We have now included benchmarking of all the models on two additional datasets, namely, Elasticity and Airfoil. Both datasets have general geometries that test the capabilities of models on irregular grid data. To demonstrate this, we have now added modifications to FNO and LSM models, namely, Geo-FNO and Geo-LSM, respectively, to work on irregular grids. See Table 2 and section 5.1 for more details.\n\n*I am curious about more details on how hyperparameters are set for different model training across dataset.*\n\n**Response:** The hyperparameters were chosen based on grid-search. We have now included further details about training methodology, hyperparameter tuning, and sensitivity in the Appendix (see Appendix section F).\n\n**Appeal to the reviewer:** With the additional experiments, results, and explanations, we now hope the reviewer finds the manuscript suitable for publication. Accordingly, we request you to raise the score for the manuscript. Please do let us know if there are any further queries."
