More specifically, the relation between self-labeling and dual-level representation is not clear. It seems that this study addresses two individual problems of the point-wise clustering method. The background of the point-wise clustering should be more informative to improve the readability. \n(2) I am not quite sure what the \"degenerate solution\" means for the point-cloud segmentation. It is also quite unclear why we need a semi-relaxed optimal transport problem definition from the introduction. What is the role of data-dependent annealing in the self-labeling process and dual-level representation? This is also not clear in the introduction. \n(3) For the Figure 1, the presentation is quite confusing, and there are even errors. For example, what do different colors represent? Which component represents the novel pseudo-label generation process? Where is the dual-level representation? The arrows among p and y on the right-most part of the figure are quite difficult to understand as well. The \"Encoder f_theta\" has been occluded...\n(4) In the experiment, especially Table 4, I found that the \"Region\" design only makes a minor contribution to the final performance, while the \"dual-representation\" is one of the major claimed contributions, making me feel that this paper is quite scattered. There is not a clear focus on tackling a specific problem, making me quite doubtful about the contribution of this paper. I agree that the studied topic is of great importance, but I believe the paper requires thorough refinement before publication."

                        "value": "The major concerns of reviewer Zvms are that motivation is not clear and straightforward, and the paper is quite scattered. We respectfully disagree with reviewer Zvms and detail the response for each point in below. We hope our response can address reviewer Zvms's concern.\n\n## Motivation is not straightforward.\n\nIn the second paragraph of the introduction, we have highlighted the shortcomings of point-wise clustering based on equal-size constraints. To reiterate, these include 1) overlooking the inherently imbalanced data distribution and 2) neglecting the rich spatial context information of objects. Those two weaknesses are closely related to novel class discovery for the point cloud segmentation problem and are both important issues. Therefore, we believe our motivation is clear, and we respectfully disagree that solving a problem from two important perspectives is a weakness.\n\nThe point-wise clustering means we segment novel classes in the point cloud relying on each individual point, ignoring structured information, such as superpoint or region[3,4]. The existing point-wise clustering methods [3,4] usually employ equal-size constraints on cluster size to avoid degenerate solutions, where all classes are assigned to a single cluster. \n\n## degenerate solution and semi-relaxed optimal transport problem\n\nIn unsupervised clustering, the degenerate solution means we learn a single cluster [1,2] for all classes. Specifically in point cloud segmentation, it means we segment all unlabeled points to a single class. To avoid the degenerate solution, they [1, 3] usually introduce a uniform distribution constraint and formulate the pseudo-label generation problem as an optimal transport problem (Eq 3 in manuscript). **However, such a uniform and equality constraint contradicts with point cloud segmentation problem, where the class distribution is inherently imbalanced, thus generating a noisy pseudo label (Figure 2 in manuscript).** To mitigate this issue, we propose a semi-relaxed optimal transport problem, which relaxes the equality constraint into a KL constraint (Eq 4) and enables us to generate high-quality pseudo-labels (Figure 2 in manuscript). Note that our manuscript has clearly motivated the semi-relaxed optimal transport in the second paragraph, and we have updated the illustration of degenerate solutions for better understanding.\n\nThe data-dependent annealing strategy is specifically designed for the self-labeling process and orthogonal with dual-level representation. It adaptively adjusts the regularization strength of KL constraint in semi-relaxed optimal transport problems, enhancing the flexibility of our formulation (see the last sentence of Paragraph 4 in the Introduction).\n\n\n## Figure 1\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion and apologize for any misunderstanding. Please refer to the General Response Part 1 for clarification."

The class distribution of pseudo-labels is regularized under the framework of relaxed Optimal Transport (OT).\n- To improve the ability to utilize the spatial relations among points, the authors propose to utilize both point-level and region-level features for pseudo-label generation."

Though not quite mentioned, I guess it indicates two independently augmented views of the same point cloud. This is however quite abnormal considering that the pseudo-label is based on prototypes. The paper does not really explain how the augmentation is used alongside all these proposed strategies, which is quite concerning: How  such augmentations affect the method? Does the method really need such augmentations to function? And how does it compare to the method in comparison, eg fairness?\n\nThe paper uses heavy notations but most of them are not quite explained and I would recognize some of the notation as unnecessary, especially the overly used sub/superscripts, which hinders the readability of this paper. For example, the notations in 3.1 and 3.2.\n\nRegarding the relaxed OT, the author adds an entropy term to Eq 4 to enable the use of fast scaling algorithms. However, this detail is not explained, regarding how it affects the OT solution and thus pseudo-label generation. In Appendix A, the discussion seems to be more focused on time complexity but not the class implance aspects.\nConsidering that the authors claim novelty in such formulation of relaxed OT, more discussion and analysis is required, especially regarding how OT captures the class balance/imbalance and its impact.\n\nBesides, since the authors emphasize the dynamic nature of weight r, which seems to be a key difference to previous methods, it's nice to see how this relaxed OT reduces to the original OT for a balanced class by controlling the r, if possible.\n\nAlso, how r affects the pseudo-label deserves more discussion and analysis. For example, a visualization on pseudo-labels of larger/smaller r, or theoretical analysis, would be desired."

Using augmentation to create two views is a well-established technique for learning a transformation-invariant representation, widely employed in novel class discovery literature [2,3], and more recently applied in point clouds[1,4,5]. In our comparison, the previous sota method [1] also adopts the same augmentation as ours to generate two views. Therefore, our comparison ensures a fair assessment.\n\nIn our method, we first generate two views of the same point cloud by different augmentation, including naive rotation and scale, which are adopted from previous work [1] and have been illustrated in Implementation Details. Then, we generate point-level and region-level imbalanced pseudo-labels through adaptive self-labeling on two views in parallel. Subsequently, we swap the pseudo-labels generated from the two views to learn transformation invariant representation.\n\nTo show the effect of augmentation, we conduct ablation on the two views and augmentation.\n\n| Aug  | Two views | ISL+AR+Region | Building | Car  | Ground | Plants | mIoU |\n| ---- | --------- | ------------- | :------: | :--: | :----: | :----: | :--: |\n|      |           | \u221a             |   22.1   | 2.1  |  34.4  |  24.8  | 20.9 |\n| \u221a    |           | \u221a             |   46.3   | 1.9  |  34.5  |  18.6  | 25.3 |\n| \u221a    | \u221a         |               |   21.6   | 2.7  |  76.6  |  26.1  | 31.8 |\n| \u221a    | \u221a         | \u221a             |   51.5   | 6.0  |  83.0  |  53.1  | 48.4 |\n\nFrom the results above, we draw the following conclusion: \n* Compare column 1 and 2, augmentation on one view has improved by 4.4% in novel classes compared with no augmentation.\n* Compare column 2 and 4, employing two views has improved by 23.1% in novel classes.\n* Compare column 3 and 4, our proposed techniques result in a significant improvement of 16.6%.\n\n\n\n[1] Luigi Riz, Cristiano Saltori, Elisa Ricci, and Fabio Poiesi.

                        "value": "We appreciate your valuable feedback and hope the following response could address your concern.\n\n## Content lacks a smooth organization .. and figure 1 is incomplete ..\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion and have carefully considered your suggestions. However, we believe that our organizational structure is reasonable, as we employ a standard format. We present an overview of our method in Section 3.1, followed by a description of our network architecture, encompassing dual-level representation and a prototype-based classifier. Subsequently, we outline the overall self-labeling framework and provide details on imbalanced pseudo-label generation and the adaptive regularization strategy. To improve clarity, we have reorganized Section 3.1 to ensure coherence. It's notable that other reviewers (cd9p, 74h9) have also praised that \"it is well-written and easy to follow\".  We would appreciate it if you could specify which part lacks a smooth organization. \n\nWe appreciate your advice on Figure 1, and please refer to the General Response Part 1 for details.\n\n## Analysis of the experimental results is not sufficient\n\n###  Hpyer-parameters of DBSCAN\n\nPlease refer to General Response.\n\n\n### Decrease in the IoU value for \"Building\"\n\n**Explanation of the decrease of \"Building\"**\n\nWe appreciate your feedback. As depicted in Table 4, the inclusion of region-level features results in only a relatively small decrease in the \"Building\" class (53.1% -> 51.5%), while the average mIoU increases by 4.2%. We note that the performance of \"Building\" is improved on the training data after incorporating region-level learning, as shown in Figure 3. Therefore, we speculate that the marginal decrease in the building class may be due to the model overfitting to the training set.\n\nDistinct from other classes, such as plants, cars, and grounds, \"Building\" is positioned farther away from the sensor, leading to a sparse spatial distribution and relatively small regions generated from DBSCAN. Therefore, we suspect that this phenomenon may arise from the prototypes capturing the bias of the relatively small region associated with the \"Building\" in the training data, which is inconsistent with the test data. This issue can be addressed by introducing additional regularization. For instance, as demonstrated in the table in General Response 2, configuring DBSCAN to generate relatively larger regions (e.g., with epsilon=0.7) significantly increases the results for the building class.\n\n**Is this method more beneficial for smaller objects?**\n\nOur method is more beneficial to dense objects instead of smaller objects. Specifically, we utilize DBSCAN, which is a density-based clustering algorithm, to generate regions for point clouds with relatively high density. Therefore, our method is beneficial for objects relative to density, rather than size."

It addresses two major issues that were present in the previous work NOPS (Riz et al. 2023): the equal class-size constraint and the omission of spatial context information during point-wise clustering. The authors introduce an adaptive self-labeling method. This method relaxes the optimal transport problem by transforming it into a semi-relaxed optimal transport (OT) problem with an annealing-like regularization strategy. Moreover, the proposed approach includes a region-level branch by clustering points into regions and generating region-level features via pooling, complementing the point-level features for prediction. The proposed method is evaluated on two outdoor datasets, and it demonstrates impressive performance compared to the baseline method NOPS."

This could include parameters for the DBSCAN algorithm, visual examples of the resultant regions, and how variations in DBSCAN parameters may impact the results. Additionally, clarification on whether \"K\" is a fixed value for different scenes and how these \"K\" regions are generated during clustering is needed.\n3. Elaborating on the initialization and updating process for class prototypes would be beneficial to better understand the methodology.\n4. Discussing the applicability of the proposed framework in indoor scenarios, where there are typically more novel classes to discover, would enhance this paper's practical relevance.\n5. Conducting an ablation study on a split of the SemanticKITTI dataset, which is known to be more challenging than SemanticPOSS, would strengthen this paper's findings.\n\n\nA minor point: In Table 3, adding a column that indicates the split index, similar to Table 1, would improve clarity."

                        "value": "We appreciate Reviewer 74h9 valuable feedback and respond to the concerns in the following.\n\n## Unknown the number of novel classes.\n\nWe agree that the utility of the novel class discovery setting is a valid point for consideration. In our manuscript, we divide novel class discovery in point clouds into two sub-problems. The first is to estimate the number of novel classes. The second problem is to discover novel classes after determining the number of novel classes, which is challenging due to imbalanced class distribution. Additionally, to ensure a fair comparison with other methods [2], we use the number of novel classes as a prior and focus on the second problem.\n\nAnd it is more realistic to consider unknown $|C_u|$. To estimate $|C_u|$, we extend the classic estimation method [1] in NCD to point cloud semantic segmentation. Specifically, we set the candidate range of the total number of categories (seen classes number $\\textless |C_{all}|\\textless$ max classes), and apply Kmeans to cluster the labeled and unlabeled point clouds in the training data, using the representation extracted from a known-class pre-trained model. Then, we evaluate the clustering performance of known classes under different $|C_{all}|$, and select $|C_{all}|$  with the highest clustering performance as the estimated $|C_{all}|$. In practice, for computational simplicity, we randomly sample 800,000 points from all scenes to cluster. We conduct experiments on splits 0 of SemanticPOSS, setting max classes to 50, which is a large class number in point cloud semantic segmentation. Consequently, the estimated $|C_u|$ is 3, which is close to the ground truth value (GT is 4).\n\nIn addition, we conduct experiments in SemanticPOSS split 0 to compare the results of our method and previous sota[2] when the estimated value deviates from the true value. As shown in the table below, our method can still significantly outperform NOPS with estimated $|C_u|$.\n\n|      | split 0  |      |        |        |           |\n| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------ | ------ | --------- |\n|      | Building | Car  | Ground | Plants | mIoU      |\n| NOPS | 25.54    | 0.00 | 68.15  | 34.12  | 31.95     |\n| Ours | 64.05    | 0.00 | 82.22  | 67.63  | **53.47** |\n\nIn conclusion, our sub-problem division is reasonable, and our method shows significant improvement compared to the previous sota, even when the estimated novel class deviates slightly from the real value. \n\nIn addition, we find that under the estimated $|C_u|$, our method achieves better results than the ground truth $|C_u|=4$. As shown in Figure 2 in the paper, when $C_u=4$, many plants and buildings are misclassified as the car class (a minor class), resulting in poorer learning for buildings and plants. In contrast, at $C_u=3$, the model ignores the car class, which is relatively small compared to plants and buildings, allowing for better learning of buildings and plants, thereby achieving superior results.\n\n[1] Sagar Vaze, Kai Han, Andrea Vedaldi, and Andrew Zisserman.

The key difference between indoor scenarios and outdoor scenarios is that Indoor scenarios 1) have more classes; 2) are more denser; 3) include additional RGB information.\n\nAs for more novel classes, our results in Table 2 show we can achieve satisfactory results compared to NOPS on harder splits, where half (6 or 7) classes are novel.  As for more dense points, we have to adjust the DBSCAN to generate appropriate regions. For the additional RGB information, we can utilize it to enhance the quality of regions and adjust the backbone to process the input RGB information.\n\nIn conclusion, our method can be relatively easily extended to indoor scenarios."
