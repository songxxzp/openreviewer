                    "value": "The paper addresses the problem of using approximate models in reinforcement learning (RL). RL training is broken into several stages:\n1) Model learning: learns a graph neural network model (GNN) for world dynamics, then clusters actions taken in that world model into groups predicted to lead to high rewards\n2) RL learning: trains an RL model (DDPG) to learn to perform the task. Search includes an exploration condition that samples from the above action clusters as part of epsilon-greedy search.\n\nTo facilitate long horizon planning, the task is divided into a series of sub-goals that are solved sequentially. The GNN used as a world model incorporates several adjustments to apply to the particular task domain (allowing for dynamic edges, edges specific to object pairs, and encoding positions in relative coordinates). Evaluations compare against a random baseline model, showing improved probability to achieve goals in a physics-based puzzle domain."

The originality lies in mining the world model to bias action exploration, in lieu of the trained policy or purely random exploration.\n\nThe GNN modifications to handle these physics-based puzzles are new for this domain.\n\n# quality\nThe experiments show the technique achieves a higher success rate than a random action model in achieving goals and subgoals. In most cases random actions fail to ever achieve goals, and rarely subgoals, while the method proposed achieves success on task goals with rates ranging between ~0.2% to ~16%.\n\n# clarity\nThe paper compares the new method to a variety of related areas, though specific comparisons to the approach taken (separating model learning from RL training) are limited. The text is fairly clear to read.\n\n# significance\nModel-based RL has a substantial community of interest, particularly at ICLR. Providing new ways to use models for improved learning - particularly when models need not be highly accurate - has potential interest to this community."

                    "value": "# originality\nThe novel components of the work are minor: training GNNs to model dynamics is well-studied (as referenced) and model-based RL is a well-studied field. The technique can be viewed as a form of exploration prior to favor exploitation of high value actions. Previous work on exploration techniques may be relevant, as these span a variety of ways to leverage approximate models for altering action selection (https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2020-06-07-exploration-drl/ provides a survey). While those techniques are typically applied to modify rewards during learning, the core approximate models are closely related to the paper technique.\n\n# quality\nIn absolute terms the success rate is low for goal success (ranging from ~0.2% to ~16%). Whether this is an improvement is not clear as the experiments only compare to a baseline of random action. No comparisons are made to SOTA on the task domain, nor are other models applied to this problem. Adding baseline methods from prior work would improve the paper quality by showing evidence of improvement. Comparisons would also benefit from including metrics on the computational costs needed for different methods and their time and memory complexity, providing a full picture of the performance of the algorithm beyond the final goal outcome.\n\n# clarity\nThe paper would benefit from an algorithm listing and figure demonstrating the overall training process workflow. These are left implicit in the text and make it difficult to follow the core algorithm.\n\n# significance\nResults lack non-random baselines for comparison. This makes it difficult to assess how much the new technique improves over the state of the art."

Figure 1 depicts how a dynamic ball interacts with a single static tool (for example, bucket tool) placed in the scene with the ball being launched at various angles and velocities at the tool.\n2. Noted.\n3. We will work on improving this in a future iteration of the paper. In Figure 3, the goal is to place tools in the scene so that the red ball \n    hits the green star goal object. The green circle represents a subgoal.\n4. In Tasks 1 and 2, a bucket tool was used to solve the tasks, whereas, in the other tasks, a polygon tool was used. Sampling from the \n    action clusters over all time steps across multiple episodes results in the given distribution of actions. \n5. Noted. Thanks for the resource on model-based exploration techniques which could serve as useful baselines. \n    CREATE is an environment designed to test generalisation to new actions in reinforcement learning. As such, the original paper \n    focuses on this problem (generalisation to new, unseen tools) and does not approach the tasks as we do (where the focus is on using \n    a single tool at training and test time). There are currently no SOTA baselines for CREATE for our context. \n6. The shaded regions represent standard deviations where multiple seeds were run.\n7. Noted."

I think this point needs to be emphasized better in the introduction.\n\n4.\tOver how many trials were the experiments conducted in Fig 6? In general, from the learning curves, the learning does not look stable.\n\n5.\tDoesn\u2019t exploration epsilon=0 imply no model guidance? If so, for say, task 4, they both reach the same asymptotic performance. Why is this the case, while in some of the other tasks, the asymptotic  performances are very different?\n\n6.\tAblations showing the effect of $\\epsilon_{threshold}$ are missing. \n\n7.\tAs claimed in the last line on Page 7, why would the policy learning diverge? I believe that the learning would still occur (as DDPG learns off-policy) but due to a lack of exploitation, the learning curves would not reflect the learnt policy.\n\n8.\tPerhaps the authors could have considered Phyre environments (https://ai.meta.com/tools/phyre/) to validate their approach.\n\n9.\tIn Fig 6, I assumed the orange color always corresponds to exploration epsilon of 0, but for task 6, the colors are swapped.\n\n10.\t\u201cBy using\u2026however uncertain\u201d \u2013 This sentence towards the end of the introduction is too long and can be phrased better."

We will work on improving this in a future iteration of the paper. In Figure 3, the goal is to place tools in the scene so that the red ball \n    hits the green star goal object. The green circle represents a subgoal.\n2. I assume you are referring to Task 4 here. Task 4 may be an \u201ceasier\u201d task in the sense that there is more leeway (or more options) in \n    the exact combination of actions that lead to the goal being achieved.\n3. Humans can use their physical reasoning intuition to focus on useful regions of the action space to improve the efficiency of learning. \n    Intuitive physics tasks also lend themselves well to generalisation - which is a key focus of the paper. Additionally, intuition is \n    approximate and imperfect, yet is still used to great effect by humans.\n4. Learning was conducted over 2 trials due to time constraints. In a future iteration, we will increase this to improve the stability of \n    results.\n5. We think this is because of the nature of these tasks. The agent is required to find a precise sequence of actions in a continuous \n    space and small deviations result in significant changes in reward. Some tasks may be \u201ceasier\u201d than others in the sense that there is \n    more leeway (or more options) in the exact combination of actions that lead to the goal being achieved.\n6. Will include in a future iteration.\n7. Agreed.\n8. The issue with Phyre is that it is a one step environment, which limits its applicability for reinforcement learning. Do you have \n    other suggestions for domains to test our approach?\n9. Noted.\n10. Noted."

But if you argue the model is not accurate enough for direct policy learning, then you should compare with it (learning a policy using data sampled from the world model). I think it would also make sense to compare with direct planning using the model. \n3.

From our understanding, sampling-based planning does not focus on learning a policy but refines the \n    distribution from which candidate actions are sampled to then be evaluated under a model?\n    Our aim was to directly assess how model inaccuracies can be mitigated through focussing on exploration priors to avoid suboptimal \n    policy learning. How do you propose we incorporate our exploration priors in a sampling-based planning setup? Or are you \n    proposing the sampling distribution acts as the exploration prior for policy learning?\n2. The subgoals are indicated by the green circles in Figure 3. They indicate regions in space that the ball trajectory is required to pass \n    through in order to achieve the overall goal. They are hand-specified and we agree that this is a limitation. However, the focus of the \n    paper is not subgoal discovery, so perhaps a simpler heuristic algorithm to sample these subgoals would be a better approach?\n3. Please could you elaborate on this point. What is meant by planning here? Usually planning refers to the process of using a learned \n    model to learn a policy. Are you suggesting we use the policy learned using model-generated data to guide exploration in a model- \n    free setting? We did try this and the results were poor. Because of the model inaccuracy, using standard model-based RL results in \n    poor policy learning. \n    The intuition for using exploration priors is that, like humans, an agent can benefit from exploring in useful regions of the action space \n    to obtain more informative reward signals in a sparse reward task. Humans use approximate models to solve trial-and-error intuitive \n    physics tasks.\n4. We will work on improving this in a future iteration of the paper. In Figure 3, the goal is to place tools in the scene so that the red ball \n    hits the green star goal object. The green circle represents a subgoal."

Concretely, model-based imagination is only used to build a prior over actions, which is used to sample actions when a non-greedy/exploratory action needs to be taken in an epsilon-greedy approach.\n\nExperiments in an intuitive physics environment show that the proposed approach can provide benefits over standard DDPG that adds noise in parameter space to explore."

However, many approaches to model-based exploration use a learned model solely for exploration (see [1, 2]). E.g., curiosity-driven approaches use a learned model to derive intrinsic rewards based on the model\u2019s prediction error, information gain, etc. The paper would benefit from discussions and empirical comparisons to other model-based approaches to exploration. \nFor instance, it is unclear if model inaccuracies would impact curiosity-based exploration more than the approach presented here.\n\nAlso see Q2.\n\n\n**W2.** The paper makes some strong assumptions that limit the generality and applicability of the proposed approach. \n\nOne strong assumption that the paper makes is to have a resettable \u2018true\u2019 environment, which allows multiple environment rollouts from the same environment state (point 3 on page 5). Another crucial assumption is the availability of subgoals in sparse reward environments.\n\nOn a minor note, Figure 6 could be improved as it is currently hard to analyse.

We appreciate the interesting ideas and points you raised in your feedback.\n\nFirstly, in response to your questions:\nThe subgoals are indicated by the green circles in the tasks - see Figure 3.\nThe learning dynamics appear unstable because of the nature of these tasks. The agent is required to find a precise sequence of actions in a continuous space and small deviations result in significant changes in reward. \n\nWe did find that planning with the world model results in significantly deteriorated performance - we will include these results in a future iteration of the paper. Your suggestion to include comparisons with other model-based exploration methods (for example, curiosity-driven approaches) is a very useful one and thanks for sharing the papers."
