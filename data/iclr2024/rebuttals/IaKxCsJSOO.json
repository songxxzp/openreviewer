Due to the nature of the dataset generation and stochastic MDP structure, this is particularly difficult. The authors use TPMs for RvS to address this problem, showing that they are better at achieving the requested returns, and perform competitively, particularly with suboptimal data. Furthermore, they are better suited for constrained-action RL."

                        "value": "### **The reason why we compare Trifle with TT.**\nAs mentioned above, in Sections 6.1 and 6.3, we select $p_\\mathrm{TT}(a_t|s_t)$ as our prior policy $p_\\mathrm{GPT}(a_t|s_t)$, so the performance gain compared with TT fairly demonstrates the significance of Trifle in improving inference-time optimality; In Section 6.2, we didn\u2019t evaluate BR-RCRL for there is no official released code, and we consider comparison with TT and DT is sufficient for demonstrating the effectiveness of adopting TPM to handle environment stochasticity.\n\n### **More details about Trifle compared to BR-RCRL.**\n| Dataset    | Environment | Trifle    | BR-RCRL   |\n| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |\n| Med-Expert | Halfcheetah | 95.1\u00b10.3  | 95.2\u00b10.8  |\n| Medium     | Halfcheetah | 113.0\u00b10.4 | 112.9\u00b10.9 |\n| Med-Replay | Halfcheetah | 109.3\u00b10.1 | 111.0\u00b10.4 |\n| Med-Expert | Hopper      | 49.5\u00b10.2  | 48.6\u00b11.1  |\n| Medium     | Hopper      | 67.1\u00b14.3  | 78.0\u00b11.3  |\n| Med-Replay | Hopper      | 83.1\u00b10.8  | 82.3\u00b11.7  |\n| Med-Expert | Walker2d    | 45.0\u00b10.3  | 42.3\u00b13.3  |\n| Medium     | Walker2d    | 97.8\u00b10.3  | 98.3\u00b12.6  |\n| Med-Replay | Walker2d    | 88.3\u00b13.8  | 80.6\u00b12.5  |\n\n\n1. The standard deviation numbers for all RvS baselines are shown in Table 4 of the updated paper. Here we show the standard deviatios of BR-RCRL and Trifle for camparison. In 7 out of 9 mujoco tasks, Trifle achieves a much lower standard deviation than BR-RCRL, indicating that Trifle performs more robustly. Notably, the results of BR-RCRL are averaged over only 5 random seeds while we evaluate Trifle on 12 random seeds. Moreover, towards a more reliable evaluation, we improved the number of random seeds to 20 for tasks with relatively high standard deviation.\n\n2. The goal of BR-RCRL is also to sample actions with a higher probability of achieving high RTGs. This work differs from ours in two key aspects: (a) BR-RCRL adopts energy-based models (EBMs) to approximately sample from $p(a | s, R)$ using iterative inference; due to the intractability of EBMs, this sampling process could suffer from slow mixing time under high-dimensional action space. In contrast, Trifle leverages TPMs to exactly compute $p(a_i | s, a_{<i}, R>v)$ ($v$ is a threshold), and then uses beam search/rejection sampling to approximate samples from $p(a_i | s, a_{<i}, E[R]>v)$. Note that since we approximate the expected-return-conditioned policy iteratively over every action dimension, the rejection rate would be moderate. (b) Once the training finishes, BR-RCRL is limited to approximately sample from $p(a | s, R)$. In contrast, Trifle can answer arbitrary marginal/conditional queries over $(s,a,R)$, naturally enabling its application in more challenging scenarios like stochastic environments or constrained policy generation. For example,  in stochastic environments, we utilize Trifle to compute multi-step value $p(V_t\\geq v | s_t, a_{t:t'})$ by marginalizing intermediate states; We could also apply Trifle to generate constrained policy  $p(a_t|s_t, E(V_t)\\geq v, c)$, where c represents arbitrary state/action constraints.\n\n### **Adding results with other TPMs.**\nWe chose PC as the adopted TPM because it can be more easily scaled up to complex datasets thanks to recent advances. Also, PCs\u2019 ability to efficiently compute arbitrary marginal/conditional probabilities meets the need of Trifle. Any TPM with sufficient expressiveness and support answering queries required by Trifle can be used.\n\n### **\"Training time optimality\" vs \"Expressivity\"**\nYes, \"training time optimality\" can be interpreted as \"expressivity\", i.e. how well/accurately the model can fit the offline trajectories to recover the ground truth distribution. We have modified the paper to clarify this, please refer to the second paragraph of Section 3.\n\n### **Questions about the rejection sampling / beam search.**\nWe implement the rejection sampling process via beam search, which is used in all applicable baselines. Specifically, Trifle leverages TPMs to exactly compute $p(a_i | s, a_{<i}, R>v)$ ($v$ is a threshold), and then uses beam search/rejection sampling to approximate samples from $p(a_i | s, a_{<i}, E[R]>v)$. Note that since we approximate the expected-return-conditioned policy iteratively over every action dimension, the rejection rate would be moderate. \n\n### **The standard deviation for all RvS approaches.**\nThe standard deviation numbers for all RvS baselines are shown in Table 4 of the updated paper. Trifle achieves relatively lower standard deviations than other baselines, indicating that Trifle performs more robustly. Notably, the results of different baselines are averaged over different numbers of random seeds. In general, we evaluate Trifle on 12 random seeds. However, towards a more reliable evaluation, we improved the number of random seeds to 20 for tasks with relatively high standard deviation. The number of evaluation seeds for BR-RCRL, DD, TT, and DT are 4, 5, 15, and 3, respectively."

The authors showed that through thorough empirical analysis that obtaining the multi-step value estimate accurately and act according to it is crucial in achieving good performance at the inference time, and previous approaches have failed to do so to some extent. In contrast, the use of TPM readily addresses such issue and consequently results in performance improvement on a range of offline reinforcement learning tasks tested (nine original D4RL locomotion tasks, a modified gym-taxi task, and three action-constrained safe RL locomotion tasks)."

The analysis (Section 3) of the correlation between inference-time optimality score (how well an action is selected based on the model's estimate of the return) and the actual return achieved is convincing, and it motivates the proposed TPM-based solution well. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this paper is the first that uses TPM in offline RL and the thorough empirical study (especially the analysis on the estimated returns vs. actual returns in Figure 1 and 2) brings insights on how useful TPM is in the context of RL/offline RL/RvS."

The nine tasks evaluated are relatively saturated at the moment and it is hard to see much performance gain (as seen in Table 1) on top of existing approaches. It would be great if the authors could test the method on harder tasks such as antmaze tasks. \n- The performance improvements on two of the three domains considered (two MuJoCo domains, in Sec 6.1 and Sec 6.3) are marginal. There does seem to be a descent performance gain on one of the custom task (on the gym-taxi environment presented in Sec 6.2) but it is not a standard task that people have evaluated on (which is fine, but a more comprehensive set of experiments would make a stronger case). \n\nOther minor comments:\n- I found Theorem 1 to be a bit out of place because showing a problem is NP-hard brings little information on how easy it is to approximate the solution, which is what people mostly care about in practice.\n- I found the details of the action-space-constrained task (Sec 6.3) to be quite terse. How is the constraint being conditioned (is it a boolean variable or the threshold value discussed in the caption of Table 2?) How is it being incorporated into the TPM?"

In fact, the main goal of Theorem 1 is to inform us that we need to resort to approximations of $p(a_t | s_t, E[V_t]>v)$.\n\n### **Details of the action-space-constrained task.**\nWe consider action space constraints in the form of \u201cvalue of the torque applied to the foot rotor \u2264 A\u201d, where A is a threshold value. We enforced the constraint on TT by masking the unsatisfied categories (each action category can be mapped to a continuous torque value according to the adopted discretization strategy, if the reconstructed value is larger than A,  we consider this category unsatisfied) of the categorical distribution $p_\\mathrm{TT} (a_t | s_t)$, and sampling from the masked distribution must satisfy the constraint. As for TPM, to compute the conditional probability, PC will involve both forward and backward processes. Therefore, we tell the satisfied categories to PC\u2019s input nodes of the constrained action variables and PC will incorporate such constraint message into its forward and backward paths."

This is achieved by optimizing and sampling from p(a_{t: T} | s_t, E[V_t] >= v). \n\nThe authors highlight that there are two main challenges in training such policies. (1) Estimation accuracy: Ability to estimate the expected return of a state and a corresponding action sequence. (2) Tractability issues: Ability to efficiently sample from this distribution. The authors claim that both of these issues are jointly responsible for poor test time performance of RvS based methods. \n\nWhile fixing the estimation accuracy part is already an active area of research, the authors focus on fixing the tractability part by using Tractable Probabilistic Models (TPMs) for sampling P(V_t >= v | s_t, a_t). The authors experimentally show that their method works well in practice and beats many other offline RL methods on various benchmarks."

But, intuitively, incorporating the value information into the sampling phase could give us better samples than naive sampling from $p(a_t|s_t)$, where \"better\" means close to samples drawn from the desired distribution $p(a_t | s_t, E[V_t]>v)$. Moreover, computing (2) for each dimension $a_t^i$ is also non-trivial when $|A| = 2^K$ as we have to marginalize out unseen action variables $a_t^{i+1},...,a_t^k$ where $|A|=n^K$. This is why non-tractable models may suffer exponential complexity and we need the TPM's ability to compute arbitrary marginals in linear time."
