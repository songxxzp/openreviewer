                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you so much for your valuable comments and suggestions. We would like to respond in detail regarding the issues you raised:\n\n1.Theoretical Foundation of the Method:\nWe recognize that the current approach may lack a complete theoretical framework. However, through a series of experiments, we have found that using CS-Fluctuation as a metric is significantly effective. The cosine similarity effectively measures the change in direction between model weight vectors, thus reflecting the learning state of the network. Experimental results show that this method is effective in preventing overfitting during fine-tuning, and the role of empirical evidence cannot be ignored.\n\n2.Quantitative Analysis:\nThe field of personalized AI in fine-tuning the foundation models and preventing overfitting is still in a developmental stage. LDMs models currently have no effective metrics to check if the model is overfitting, we can only use the generated results to make a manual judgment. \n\nBesides, Our approach is based on the training step deciding to early stop, and returning the LoRA model for the epoch of the corresponding training step, and using it to generate qualitative results (generating images). Therefore, the \"overfitted LoRA\" results we show are exactly what you would expect after several valleys. As the training progresses, the overfitting of the model will gradually increase, leading to further degradation of the quality of the generated images.\n\n3.Explanation on Qualitative Results:\nOur goal is to obtain personalized text-to-image models with high generation quality, which should efficiently incorporate references (e.g., faces) provided by individuals, while maintaining their original text-guided generation capabilities. Overfitted LoRA models typically exhibit lower image quality, such as low pixel, blurred, or unrealistic features (as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 3). In addition, overfitting also affects the text-based generation ability of the model, as shown by \"arms crossed\" in Figure 1 and \"long blue hair\" in the first line of Figure 3. \n\nThank you again for your review and valuable comments. We look forward to further guidance and suggestions."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you so much for your valuable comments and suggestions. In response to your concerns, we provide the following explanations and answers:\n\nRegarding the Weakness:\n\n1.Theoretical Foundation of the Method:\nAlthough our method may lack the traditional full theoretical framework, it has demonstrated significant results in a series of experiments. We chose cosine similarity as the metric mainly because it is a straightforward and effective measure of the directional change between model weigh vectors, thus reflecting the learning state of the network. Experimental results show that this approach is effective in preventing overfitting during fine-tuning, and the role of empirical evidence cannot be ignored.\n\n2.Normalization of CS-Fluctuation:\nAs shown in Equation 4, we have already normalized the learning rate to eliminate the effect of learning rate on CS-Fluctuation. We agree that further normalization of CS-Fluctuation is necessary to ensure its validity in different settings.\n\n3.Comparative Analysis:\nThe field of personalized AI in fine-tuning the foundation models and preventing overfitting is still in a developmental stage, and we do not include comparative analysis with other approaches in our paper due to the lack of directly comparable existing work.\n\nRegarding the Questions:\n\n1.Relationship Between Epoch and Training Steps:\nEpoch and training steps actually correspond to each other and represent different ways of controlling training process. The formula is: Training steps = Repeat * Train set size * Epochs / Batch Size. In Figure 1, the better-performing LoRA models are the results of Epoch 2 and Epoch 3. This conclusion can also be reached and validated through manual judgment of the results generated by the LoRA model. \n\nWhen dealing with a large number of personalized modeling tasks, the absence of a metric like CS-Fluctuation would result in having to manually selection for each tasks, leading to significant time consumption.\n\n2.Strategy of Early Stopping:\nOur approach is based on training steps to decide on early stopping and returns the LoRA model of the epoch in which the selected training step is located. We do not use the model at the exact training step moment because it may be overfitted to the current batch of data. \n\nRegarding why we do not directly early stop at a fixed epoch (e.g., K=2), the reason is that the model training results are affected by Repeat factor. We set all repeats to 50 (indicating the number of times each image is used in each epoch). If the repeat value is set higher or lower, a fixed K value would no longer be applicable.\n\nThank you again for your review and valuable comments. We look forward to further guidance and suggestions."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you very much for your valuable comments and suggestions. Regarding the issues you mentioned, we would like to respond as follows:\n\n1.The concerns you point our are indeed important, and our current approach is mainly applicable to LoRA, but we view it as a significant starting point and believe that the core concepts can be applied to other fine-tuning approaches, which is the focus of our future work.\n\n2.We have conducted many experiments on this point, and due to the use of limited dataset to train such a larger network, the training process can be unstable with many minor fluctuations. The moving window average techniques aims to balance the stability and sensitivity of the results to avoid misjudgments due to minor fluctuations. Our experimental results have proven this method to be effective in practice.\n\n3.Regarding the choice of the second valley, we recognize that it may seem subjective. However, this choice is based on extensive experiments and analyses. We have found that he first valley typically occurs in the early stage of fine-tuning, when the model has not yet fully adapted to the data. The second valley, on the other hand, provided a more reliable indicator that the model is beginning to overfit.\n\n4.Our choice to use specific datasets for experiments is intended to better simulate real-world applications of personalized AI. This design allows anyone to replicate our experiment results using their own photos to personalize the foundation models.\n\n5.The LLAMA models are selected because of their open-source nature and the availability of different size versions. Meanwhile, your point is reasonable, and in future work we intend to include more experiments on downstream tasks of LLMs.\n\n6.The code provides all the experimental details, which are not all shown in the paper due to space issues.\n\n7.Regarding the issue of some LoRA models not outperforming the original, un-fine-tuned models, we have discussed this in our paper. This may be due to larger models being more prone to overfitting, especially when fine-tuned on such limited datasets.\n\nThank you again for your review and valuable comments. We look forward to further guidance and suggestions."

Fine-tuning these pre-trained models is a cost-effective way to adapt them to specific, smaller datasets, but non-experts often struggle with hyperparameter settings and risk overfitting without realizing it. To address this challenge, the paper introduces a novel monitoring metric called CS-Fluctuation, which aids in early stopping during the fine-tuning process. This approach combines Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fit personalized data while continuously monitoring the cosine similarity of parameter changes between the LoRA branch and its corresponding layer. When these changes stabilize, it signals the onset of overfitting, which becomes more pronounced as fine-tuning progresses. Empirical experiments with various types of personalized data on both vision and language foundation models confirm the effectiveness of CS-Fluctuation in early stopping LoRA fine-tuning."

We have carefully considered the issues you raised and will respond to each of them in turn.\n\n1.Innovation and Contribution: Although our research does employ the pre-existing LoRA method, our innovation extends beyond this. The core innovation of our work is the introduction of a new metric and a unique approach focused on detecting overfitting and early stopping during the fine-tuning process of foundation models. This is a common but unsolved challenge in current research. We not only identified this challenge, but also developed an innovation approach to monitor and avoid the overfitting issues, which is quite rare in existing studies.\n\n2.Generalization of CS-Fluctuation: Despite the fact that our experiments are based on some specific datasets, the design concept and methodology behind them have universally applicability. Our experiments all simulate individuals personalizing the foundation model using the limited data they provide. Based on this design, each individual can reproduce the results of the experiments with their own photos.\n\n3.Real-world Applications: Our work has mentioned two real-world application scenarios, such as individuals who want text-to-image models to generate personalized, high-quality face images, or specialized LLMs models for specific domains. These applications are currently pretty common in the field of personalized AI, and their corresponding experimental results also demonstrate the value and applicability of our approach in solving real-world problems.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your review and valuable feedback. We look forward to further suggestions from you."
