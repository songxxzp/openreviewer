                    "value": "1. The paper's argumentation is unclear, and the motivation is not convincing. For instance:\n\n\ta. Why does IE-MMA, in conjunction with meta-learning, converge into multimodal meta-alignment?\n\tb. What specific levels are referred to by \"multi-level\"?\n\n\tc. The motivation for the integration of RS-MMA and IE-Meta-MMA lacks persuasiveness due to the unclear exposition of the respective advantages.\n\n\td. How does MLMMA differ from multi-level RS-MMA?\n\n\te. What does \"meta-MMA\" refer to?\n\n\tf. What is the nature of the dependence between RS-MMA and IE-Meta-MMA, and why is it considered a new challenge?\n\n\tg. While multi-modal alignment is a crucial topic in deep learning with applications across various multi-modal tasks, why does this paper primarily focus on chemistry? It initially conveys the impression of proposing a general multimodal alignment model but, in practice, concentrates solely on multimodal alignment within the field of chemistry. Additionally, the authors fail to provide sufficient justification for this specific focus.\n\n2. In the related work section, the author lists relevant studies but lacks a comparative analysis of this work. There is a dearth of emphasis on what distinguishes or advantages this work.\n\n3. Some explanations lack clarity, for instance, the explanation of why the \"red cross\" part results in \"the wrong alignment\" is inadequately addressed. A more comprehensive analysis should be presented, including instances where the proposed model may fail."

When you prepare the data for Spec2Mol retrieval task, how to align spectra from nmrshiftdbs to molecules from Pub-Chem dataset?\n3. What is the difference between the task of molecular alignment and Spec2Mol retrieval?\n4. In section 4.1.2, there seems to be a gap between a=0.2 and a=0.5. Why do you claim the optimal setting is 0.2 without testing parameters between 0.2 and 0.5?\n5. Do you envision broader applications for the method you've proposed in the field of molecular chemistry? Additionally, in which other domains do you believe it could be applied?\n6. In the isomer recognition task, you have only provided 10 case studies, all with 100% accuracy. Is it possible to test the model on a larger dataset and more challenging tasks?"
