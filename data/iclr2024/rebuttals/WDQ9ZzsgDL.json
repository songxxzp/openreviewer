                    "value": "This paper introduces PromptNER, a prompt-based algorithm for few-shot and cross-domain Named Entity Recognition (NER). It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate potential entities along with explanations for their compatibility with entity types. The method requires modular entity type definitions, few-shot examples, and explanatory text. PromptNER achieves better performance on few-shot NER and cross-domain NER over baseline methods. The study demonstrates the flexibility and adaptability of PromptNER across domains with minimal computational cost."

In essence, the idea that the paper alludes to strikes me as rather naive. Almost every LLM-based NER initiative could effortlessly incorporate the strategy of embedding entity definitions within prompt texts, facilitating the LLM's comprehension. In a nutshell, I'm unconvinced that this paper heralds any significant fresh technological insights.\n\n2. The related work section falls short of explicitly highlighting how the proposed method differentiates from, and potentially improves upon, existing works. Such delineations are crucial for situating a new method in the context of established research.\n\n3. There's a palpable omission of numerous standard few-shot NER benchmarks, such as WNUT-2017, MIT-Movie and MIT-Restaurant, JNLPBA, among others. Moreover, there's a conspicuous absence of comparative analysis with many of the state-of-the-art few-shot NER models.\n\n4. Of paramount concern is the author's decision to juxtapose their model, based on GPT3.5/GPT4, directly with the baselines. This presents an overtly skewed comparison, heavily favoring the presented model. Such disparities render any conclusions derived from the experiments to be questionably validated. It's evident that OpenAI's LLM models outclass the baselines by multiple magnitudes, and the proprietary nature of these models further impedes reproducibility. A more equitable comparison would necessitate evaluating the proposed prompt methodology and baseline techniques using identical open-source LLMs, ensuring both type and size compatibility."

Given the stated weaknesses, how do the authors justify the claimed novelty of the PromptNER methodology, especially in light of its evident simplicity and seemingly naive approach?\n   \n2. Could the authors amplify on the differentiators between their proposed method and existing literature, providing a clearer positioning of their research contribution?\n\n3. What rationale underpins the selection of benchmarks for evaluation, and why were certain prominent few-shot NER benchmarks omitted?\n\n4. Can the authors elucidate their choice to compare their model based on GPT3.5/GPT4 directly with the baselines, given the glaring discrepancies in terms of model scale and accessibility?"

We believe that the simplicity of the PromptNER approach is something that enables it to perform well in diverse scenarios without the need for much modification. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a system that uses a prompting template to perform end-to-end Named Entity Recognition in a FewShot setting without also requiring some form of prefix tuning or parameter updates. It is certainly true that the improvements of PromptNER come from using more powerful LLMs like GPT4. The scaling experiments also confirm that this improvement does not occur when using smaller models. However, in exchange for requiring a much larger model, this method now requires significantly less NER data that matches the target distribution. As for the rationale for the selecting of evaluation benchmarks and methods, we made an effort to test a wide range of 6 different NER benchmarks (ConLL, Genia, FewNERD, CrossNER, FabNER, TweetNER), in an effort to get standard FewShot NER benchmarks (ConLL), NER benchmarks in specialized domains (Genia, CrossNER, FabNER, TweetNER) as well as NER benchmarks which have contradictory information between train and test domains (FewNERD), we compare against 3-7 other methods from the past 2 years and make sure we include the method that reports the highest performance on each dataset. For the FabNER and TweetNER tasks, we selected the best methods from the ConLL dataset results to manually compute the results."

It is certainly true that the improvements of PromptNER come from using more powerful LLMs like GPT4. The scaling experiments also confirm that this improvement does not occur when using smaller models. However, in exchange for requiring a much larger model, this method now requires significantly less NER data that matches the target distribution. This can be seen in our CrossDomain NER experiments, where PromptNER is able to outperform other methods while using less than 2% of the data than other methods. When comparing with other FewShot methods, most other methods utilize a source domain NER dataset that is similar to the FewShot target domain (e.g. pretraining on OntoNotes before transferring onto CONLL). PromptNER does not require the backbone language model to have seen any NER data and hence does not rely on the target domain being similar to the source domain to achieve good performance."

It is intuitive to inform the model of the definition, few-shots, and chain-of-thought to accomplish the task. I wish to see how these prompts are interacting with the final outputs so as to provide more insights on how the future work can learn from the prompt design or use the LLMs properly in classic NLP tasks. Also, I think it is more innovative to design specialized modules in the prompt engineering for NER tasks. Otherwise, the current work is similar to a strong baseline which is helpful to future work for sure, but may not be ready for a long research paper."

We do agree that the methodology and its design is intuitive; we believe that it is a strength of the method that would enable its use in a wide range of NER problem domains without requiring much change. While developing the method, we did explore the option of having a system that operated using specialized modules instead (e.g. a system that looped over every word/phrase to classify them independently and a system that went through multiple rounds of refinement using the prompt), however, the performance of the system presented in the paper was superior."
