                        "value": "**Dear Reviewer hLWM:**\n\nWe appreciate your insightful thoughts of our work. We will address your concerns as follows:\n\n**Q1: The used heatmap method is not new and a similar method has been used in TSP and VRP.**\n\nWe appreciate the nice works [1,2] which leverage heat-map to boost the performance of TSP. Our heat-map is different from those applied in routing algorithm from two aspects.\n\n* Firstly, our motivation to propose the heat-map is to solve complex vector bpp such as CCBPP. Learning-based packing problems often use sequential models to construct solutions and they can also get promising results on geometric BPPs. In this paper, we offer another perspective to solve complex vector BPP such as CCBPP. Concretely, we introduce the connection matrix as a label to represent whether different items are packed together in the optimal result, which can better represent the cluster information in the packing problems.\n* Secondly, the training details are slightly different from [1,2]. Our heat-map consider connection information including modularity information while conventional research focus on node information and geometrical information. Besides, the ground-truth data generation via cutting stock algorithm mentioned in Appendix D.1 cost much lower time than the TSP labels generation by concorde.\n\n[1] Joshi, Chaitanya K. et al. \u201cAn Efficient Graph Convolutional Network Technique for the Travelling Salesman Problem.\u201d ArXiwo qianv abs/1906.01227 (2019): n. pag.\n\n[2] Fu, Zhang-Hua et al. \u201cGeneralize a Small Pre-trained Model to Arbitrarily Large TSP Instances.\u201d ArXiv abs/2012.10658 (2020): n. pag.\n\n**Q2: The studied topic CCBPP and problem is less-studied and uncommon to see.**\n\nWe are very sorry we don't claim the significance and generality of CCBPP clearly in our paper,  more about the CCBPP will be added into the revision of the manuscript. As far as we're concerned, the points can be listed as follows:\n\n1. **In the academic view, CCBPP as well as vector BPP are fully studied beyond neural combinatorial optimization community.** \n\n    BPP can be divided into two main categories, geometric BPP (2D and 3D BPP), and vector BPP. The difference between these two problems is whether we should consider the geometrical constraints.\n    In the vector BPP research field, there are plenty of works proposed to solve vector BPP with different constraints. Among them, class-constrained BPP is a typical variants. These research mainly focus on approximation heuristics or exact solutions. Unfortunately, learning-based methods have not been applied in this field so far.\n    \n2. **In the application view, CCBPP is commonly encountered in BPP field with wide applications.** \n\n    In general, BPP can be viewed as a resource allocation problem with resources from two kinds, incompatible resources and compatible resources (shared resources). The vanilla vector BPP only considers incompatible resources. Actually, there are plenty of real-world applications corresponding to both kinds of resources. For example, an operation machine can only process 2 kinds of operation (compatible resource) with limited materials (incompatible resources) . This is quite common in many real-world applications, *Automatic Scaling in Cloud Computing*, *Data-Placement Problem in Video-on-Demand* , *Production Planning* , *Co-painting Problem* , *Steel Mill Slab Problem* are all typical real-world applications of CCBPP.\n\n**Q3: cluster decode and active search are not explained well, could you clearly explain how to select items?**\n\nWe are very sorry details of Cluster Decoder are not explained clearly in our paper.\nThe purpose of the Cluster Decoder is to map the trained heatmap to the final packing result. It contains two parts: Cluster Decode and Active search. The Cluster Decode strategy maps the heatmap to a packing sequence. The packing sequence can be transferred to the final packing result according to First Fit (FF) scheme which is commonly used in packing problem, as mentioned in section 4.3.1. For each selected item, FF will be placed to the smallest number of the bin if the constraints are satisfied.\n\nActive Search fine-tunes the last layer of GCN based on the corresponding packing results obtained by the packing sequence along with the FF. In this way, the generated heatmap can be more consistent with the characteristics of the test instance itself and can also decode better results."

                        "value": "**Q4: the active search is not novel, yet it boots the final results significantly.**\n\nActive search is not the main contribution of this paper, it is combined with the  cluster decode strategy so that the instance-wise solution can be obtained by only changing the parameters of the last layer of Encoder. In the ablation experiments E.1.1 and E.1.2 provided in the appendix, we proved that the heat-map generated by the Encoder and the cluster decode strategy are also effective. These two parts also play greater roles in improving experimental results. \n\nActive Search is an excellent search strategy that can fine-tune the network according to the characteristics of each example. For combinatorial optimization problems, it is common to have differences between training samples and test samples, so there are many learning methods that combine certain search strategies to further improve the quality of the solution[1-5].\n\n[1]\tFu, Zhang-Hua et al. \u201cGeneralize a Small Pre-trained Model to Arbitrarily Large TSP Instances.\u201d ArXiv abs/2012.10658 (2020): n. pag.\n\n[2] Choo, Jinho et al. \u201cSimulation-guided Beam Search for Neural Combinatorial Optimization.\u201d Advances in neural information processing systems 35 (2022).\n\n[3] Kool, Wouter et al. \u201cDeep Policy Dynamic Programming for Vehicle Routing Problems.\u201d\nIntegration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming (2021).\n\n[4] Qiu, Ruizhong et al. \u201cDIMES: A Differentiable Meta Solver for Combinatorial Optimization Problems.\u201d Advances in neural information processing systems 35 (2022).\n\n[5] Son, Jiwoo et al. \u201cMeta-SAGE: Scale Meta-Learning Scheduled Adaptation with Guided Exploration for Mitigating Scale Shift on Combinatorial Optimization.\u201d International Conference on Machine Learning (2023).\n\n**Q5: How to calculate the edge features?**\n\nThe edge features are set as the cosine similarities corresponding to the one-hot form of class features, as mentioned in section 4.2.1.\n\n**Q6:  What's the size number N set in the experiments?**\n\nWe are sorry we didn't make it clear in the text. When generating the ideal data set, we generated 20 bins with 100% utilization. Since the item size is 10~25 and the box capacity is 100, we can put a maximum of 10 items in each bin and a minimum of 4. In order to ensure the consistency of training, we set N = 20 * 10 = 200. If the number in one bin does not reach 10, we will add 0, as stated in Appendix D.1.\n\n**Q7: What is the dataset used for finetuning in experiments? Is it fair to compare to baselines without finetune dataset?**\n\nThe finetune is performed on **instance level**. The solution of each instance is further improved based on active search, which is denoted as 'finetune' in our paper. In other words, this finetuning procedure is performed on each test instance *separatedly*, and the dataset for finetuning is the instance itself with iterated costs $C(\\pi) = -R(\\pi)$. \n\nOn the other hand, since active search is not the main contribution of this paper, we compare the performance of our model without finetune to these baselines (See experiments E.1.1 and E.1.2 provided in the appendix). These experiments demonstrate that our Encoder-Decoder model without finetune (GCN-Cluster-Greedy and GCN-Cluster-Sampling) also outperforms baselines (PointNet-Greedy and PointNet-Sampling), which validates the advantages of our model.\n\n\n**Q8:  Could other constraints be considered rather than just class numbers?**\n\nThe class-constrains in CCBPP changes the relationship between different items and it  can be reflected in problem formulation. If the mask is leveraged to judge the constraint in the form of a sequence, such as using seq2seq to construct the problem model, the results may not be so promising, as shown in our paper.\n\nIf there are some **unstable** and **personalized features** in the actual scene, which can not be encoded by the network, adding restrictions can be added to Cluster Decoder with specific mask function so that both the connectivity probabilities denoted by the heatmap and the complex constrains can be considered in the final result."

The encoder-decoder models for the combinatorial problems such as [1-3] are sequential models, which means the neural solvers are learned by the constructed sequences. In the context of CCBPP, an optimal packing result always corresponds to numerous packing sequences since shuffling the order of items within each bin does not affect the packing solution but will directly alter the packing sequence. As a result, sequential model may not be suitable.\n\nOverall, the novelty of our proposed encoder-decoder framework are listed as follows:\n\n* In the Encoder part, we introduce the connection matrix as a label to train the heat-map so that it can bring richer information than a packing sequence. \n\n* The Cluster-Decoder is designed to generate instance-wise packing solutions from heat-map, which successfully closes the gap between a heat-map and a final packing solution. \n\n* Our encoder and decoder are separated so that it is more flexible when applied in actual scene. The encoder is able to capture more problem-specific information, and the decoder can fine-tune the final solution at instance-wise level.\n\n[1] Vinyals, Oriol, Meire Fortunato, and Navdeep Jaitly. \"Pointer networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 28 (2015).\n\n[2] Li, D., et al. \"Solving Packing Problems by Conditional Query Learning.\" International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Conference 2020.\n\n[3] Zhang, Jingwei, Bin Zi, and Xiaoyu Ge. \"Attend2pack: Bin packing through deep reinforcement learning with attention.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.04333 (2021).\n\n**Q2:  More insights into the bin packing problem**\n\nAs far as we are concerned, our contributions to other BPPs can be listed as follows:\n\n* Conventional learning-based COP algorithms mainly focus on solving geometric BPP like 3DBPP, In this paper, we bring another complex vector BPP, CCBPP into people's view and hope our work could bring more attention to these problems which are common encountered in practical applications along with great potential values.\n\n* The Encoder-Decoder structure to deal with COPs are mainly end2end sequential models, they may  not catch the cluster information of the items. Our framework make good use of the connection matrix as a label to represent the cluster information of the bin packing problem, and it can be applied to other packing problems where the results are in the form of aggregation.\n\n* The Encoder and Decoder mentioned in our framework are separated. The Encoder can better characterize the characteristics of the problem itself, while the Decoder can modify the solution at instance-wise level. In actual application scenarios, some personalized or customized constraints can be solved using the mask mechanism combined with the Cluster Decoder.\n\n**Q3: Can you plot the gap vs time for different methods?**\n\nFor all the baselines, only the heuristic methods ACO and GA are iterative algorithms during testing, the results of other algorithms do not change over time. We list several time v.s. the gap in the following table when $Q = 10, C = 5$.\n\n| Method   |   Time=20s |  Time=40s |   Time=60s |  Time=80s| Time=100s| \n|:----------:|:------:|:----:|:------:|:----:|:------:|\n|Random    |  5.03%|  5.03%|  5.03%| 5.03%|  5.03%|\n|FFD    |  5.00%|  5.00%|  5.00%| 5.00%|  5.00%|\n|GA    |  2.90%| 2.38%| 2.22%|2.10%| 2.05%|\n|ACO  |   4.64%| 4.40%|4.175%| 4.10%|3.90%| \n|Ptr  |   4.95%| 4.95%|4.95%| 4.95%|4.95%| \n|Ours|2.27%| 2.125%|2.10%|2.075%| 2.00%|"

We will address your comments as follows:\n\n**Q1: the significance and generality of CCBPP**\n\nWe are sorry we don't claim the significance and generality of CCBPP clearly in our paper,  more about the CCBPP will be added into the revision of the manuscript. As far as we're concerned, the points are listed as follows:\n\n1. **In the academic view, CCBPP as well as vector BPP are fully studied beyond neural combinatorial optimization community.** \n\n    BPP can be divided into two main categories, geometric BPP (2D and 3D BPP), and vector BPP [1]. The difference between these two problems is whether we should consider the geometrical constraints.\n    In the vector BPP research field, there are plenty of works proposed to solve vector BPP with different constraints [1, 2, 3]. Among them, class-constrained BPP is a typical variants. These research mainly focus on approximation heuristics [4] or exact solutions [5]. Unfortunately, learning-based methods have not been applied in this field so far.\n    \n2. **In the application view, CCBPP is commonly encountered in BPP field with wide applications.** \n\n     In general, BPP can be viewed as a resource allocation problem with resources from two kinds, incompatible resources and compatible resources (shared resources). The vanilla vector BPP only considers incompatible resources. Actually, there are plenty of real-world applications corresponding to both kinds of resources. For example, an operation machine can only process 2 kinds of operation (compatible resource) with limited materials (incompatible resources) [6]. This is quite common in many real-world applications, *Automatic Scaling in Cloud Computing [7]*, *Data-Placement Problem in Video-on-Demand* [8], *Production Planning* [9], *Co-painting Problem* [10], *Steel Mill Slab Problem* [6] are all typical real-world applications of CCBPP.\n\n[1] Christensen, Henrik I. , et al. \"Approximation and online algorithms for multidimensional bin packing: A survey.\" Computer Science Review 24.May(2017):63-79.\n\n[2] Epstein, Leah , Csan\u00e1d Imreh, and A.

There are many learning-based encoder-decoder structures to solve combinatorial optimization problems [1-3] including bin packing problems, they are all end-to-end sequential models which means the both the encoder and the decoder are learned via sequences. However, an optimal packing result always corresponds to numerous packing sequences since shuffling the order of items within each bin does not affect the packing solution but will directly alter the packing sequence. Thus, it brings complexity when relying solely on learning from sequential models.\n\nOverall, the novelty of our proposed encoder-decoder framework are from three aspects:\n\n* In the encoder part, we introduce the connection matrix as a label to train the heat-map so that it can bring richer information than a packing sequence. \n\n* The Cluster-Decoder is designed to generate instance-wise packing solutions from heat-map, which successfully closes the gap between a heat-map and a final packing solution. \n\n* Our encoder and decoder are separated so that it is more flexible when applied in actual scene. The encoder is able to capture more problem-specific information, and the decoder can fine-tune the final solution at instance-wise level.\n\n[1] Vinyals, Oriol, Meire Fortunato, and Navdeep Jaitly. \"Pointer networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 28 (2015).\n\n[2] Li, D., et al. \"Solving Packing Problems by Conditional Query Learning.\" International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Conference 2020.\n\n[3] Zhang, Jingwei, Bin Zi, and Xiaoyu Ge. \"Attend2pack: Bin packing through deep reinforcement learning with attention.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.04333 (2021).\n\n\n**Q3: the motivation of using a heatmap, why not use node classification?**\n\nLearning-based packing problems often use sequential models to construct solutions and they can also get promising results. In this paper, we offer another perspective to introduce the connection matrix as a label to represent whether different items are packed together in the optimal result, which can better represent the cluster information in the packing problems. The results in our paper show that the learned heap-map can better obtain the relationship of different items.\n\nNode classification may not be suitable for packing problems since there is no difference between different bins, which means the results reflect the aggregation of different items rather than categories. Clustering Algorithm such as knn is also not recommended since the packing constraints may not fully be satisfied, as mentioned in section 4.3.1.\n\n**Q4: related work of other learning-based approaches for bin packing problems is missing.**\n\nWe will add the corresponding related work to the revision of the manuscript.\n\n**Q5: the baselines are insufficient.**\n\nThanks for reminding us the improved version of ptr! In [1], the encoder was changed to an attention structure while the decoder still used the rnn structure. In [2], both the encoder and decoder were changed to a transformer-styled multi-head attention structure.\n\nWe conduct experiments on the modified ptr[1,2]. Results below show that three different methods[1,2,3] do not make a big difference on CCBPP, which shows the limitation of sequence-to-sequence model when solving our problem. The rnn or the attention network may  not be able  to catch the constraints of different items as GCN does, and the  ptr cannot obtain the cluster information of different items as the heat-map does, as we stated in the third paragraph in section 1.\n\n|Method| **Q = 10,**| **C = 3**  | |**Q = 20,**  | **C = 3**| |**Q = 30,** |**C = 3** | |\n|:------:|:---------:|:------:|:----:|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|:------:|\n| | Bins|     Gap      |  Time |Bins|     Gap      |  Time |Bins|     Gap      |  Time |\n|PointNetGreedy|21.41|7.05%|0.0181|21.88|9.40%|0.0181|22.11|10.55%|0.019|\n|PointNet-Sampling|21.07|5.35%|0.4|21.03|5.15%|0.41|21.26|6.30%|0.625|\n|Nazari.

There are some excellent works in the direction of combinatorial optimization that transplant models trained on small-scale problems to solve large-scale ones [1-3]\uff0c which will benefit us a lot.\n\n* N = 300\n\n| Method  |  N = 300| Q = 10   | C = 5 |  N = 300| Q = 20   | C = 5|\n|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:----:|:-------------:|:------:|:----:|\n|    | Bins|     Gap      |  Time |Bins|     Gap      |  Time |\n|Random  |   31.25 |4.17% |0.0136| 31.07|3.57% |0.0134|\n|FFD |   31.05|3.50%| 0.0141|31.125 |3.82%| 0.0145|\n|GA    |   30.58| 1.93%|27.99|30.62|2.07%|29.753|\n|ACO  |  30.625| 2.08%| 163.87|30.595|1.98%|179.704|\n|PointNet-Greedy|  31.09| 3.63%| 0.034|31.19|3.97%|0.0305|\n|PointNet-Sampling| 31.00|3.33%| 0.3537|31|3.33%|0.5056|\n|GCN-Cluster,Greedy |31.00 |3.33%|0.0644|30.995|3.32%|0.0702|\n|GCN-Cluster,Sampling |30.925|3.08%|0.6250|30.93|3.10%|0.6911|\n|GCN-Cluster, AS(Ours)| **30.545**|**1.82%**| 21.0235|**30.57**|**1.90%**|20.16|\n\n* N = 500\n\n| Method  |  N = 500| Q = 10  | C = 5 |  N = 500| Q = 20   | C = 5|\n|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:----:|:-------------:|:------:|:----:|\n|    | Bins|     Gap      |  Time |Bins|     Gap      |  Time |\n|Random  |   51.86 |3.72% |0.0409| 51.95 |3.90% |0.0409|\n|FFD |   51.415 |2.83%| 0.0308|51.76 |3.52%|0.0315|\n|GA    |   50.90| 1.80%|72.65| 51.00| 2.00%|76.65|\n|ACO  |  50.97| 1.94%| 388.10| 51.00| 2.00%| 418.45|\n|PointNet-Greedy| 51.91| 3.82%| 0.0509| 52.06| 4.12%| 0.0509|\n|PointNet-Sampling| 51.22|2.44%| 0.7997|51.46|2.92%| 0.8793|\n|GCN-Cluster,Greedy |51.465 |2.93%|0.1300|51.6450 |3.29%|0.1388|\n|GCN-Cluster,Sampling |51.005|2.01%| 1.4969|51.02|2.04%| 1.5866|\n|GCN-Cluster, AS(Ours)| **50.84**|**1.68%**| 63.72|**50.99**|**1.98%**| 64.52|\n\n\n[1]\tLi, S., Yan, Z., & Wu, C.

As a good solution requires clustering of items in the same class, existing sequential learning-based algorithms struggle. Authors propose a GNN-based model, which is pre-trained on synthetic data with ground truths. The model is further fine-tuned with policy gradient. In order to account for the fact that good solutions should cluster items in the same class, a decoding algorithm that prioritizes items clustered to existing open bin is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms reasonable heuristics, typical population-based algorithms, and standard Pointer Networks."

Authors demonstrate that indeed the proposed method, which accounts for the clustering of items in the heatmap, outperforms previous sequential methods. This is an original contribution that will help the research community to think differently. As the use of GNNs & heatmaps are common in other methods, innovations in this paper, such as cluster decoding would also easily transfer to other problems in the future work. \n\nQuality: Authors follow best practices in the literature. First, they use GNN to model the interaction between variables, which has become standard in neural combinatorial optimization algorithms. Then, they use heatmap for decoding, which is becoming standard for TSP and related problems. The choice of supervised pre-training is also very well-suited, because difficult problems with known ground-truth shall be easily generated. The proposed method also makes a good improvement over Pointer Network baseline. Experiments cover both synthetic and real-world data.\n\nClarity: The main ideas of the paper is mostly straightforward to follow, although I had some questions."

When authors present the paper, attendees wouldn't be interested in the talk unless they are convinced of the usefulness of CCBPP. While authors discuss CCBPP applications in Section 3, I would encourage authors to elaborate more on their significance in order to convince this conference's audience."

I understand this has nice interpretation as modularity, but often, probabilities are harder to optimize with gradient descent than log-probabilities, because sigmoid has near zero gradient for most of its domain.\n\nI was also not sure how Policy Gradient shall be applied on ClusterDecode. Authors say $p_\\theta$ in Policy Gradient equation (Section 4.3.2) correspond to Cluster Decode, but according to Appendix C, Cluster Decode is mostly deterministic algorithm (other than the choice of the first item). Hence, conditioned on the choice of the first item, the probability will be 1 for chosen item at the state, and 0 for not chosen items."

                        "value": "**Dear Reviewer aXcu:**\n\nWe appreciate your recognition of the novelty and effectiveness of our work.  We will address your concerns as follows:\n\n**Q1: More introduction of CCBPP**\n\nWe are sorry the introduction of CCBPP is not enough in our paper, more about the CCBPP will be added into the revision of the manuscript. As far as we are concerned, the significance of CCBPP can be listed as follows:\n\n1. **In the academic view, CCBPP as well as vector BPP are fully studied beyond neural combinatorial optimization community.** \n\n    BPP can be divided into two main categories, geometric BPP (2D and 3D BPP), and vector BPP [1]. The difference between these two problems is whether we should consider the geometrical constraints.\n    In the vector BPP research field, there are plenty of works proposed to solve vector BPP with different constraints [1, 2, 3]. Among them, class-constrained BPP is a typical variants. These research mainly focus on approximation heuristics [4] or exact solutions [5]. Unfortunately, learning-based methods have not been applied in this field so far.\n    \n2. **In the application view, CCBPP is commonly encountered in BPP field with wide applications.** \n\n    In general, BPP can be viewed as a resource allocation problem with resources from two kinds, incompatible resources and compatible resources (shared resources). The vanilla vector BPP only considers incompatible resources. Actually, there are plenty of real-world applications corresponding to both kinds of resources. For example, an operation machine can only process 2 kinds of operation (compatible resource) with limited materials (incompatible resources) [6]. This is quite common in many real-world applications, *Automatic Scaling in Cloud Computing [7]*, *Data-Placement Problem in Video-on-Demand* [8], *Production Planning* [9], *Co-painting Problem* [10], *Steel Mill Slab Problem* [6] are all typical real-world applications of CCBPP.\n    \n3. Our proposed method is not restricted on CCBPP, indeed our method provides an efficient way to handle vector BPP with multiple properties and complex constraints, which is seldom studied in neural combinatorial optimization field. Furthermore, we hope our work could bring more attention to these problems which are common encountered in practical applications along with great potential values.\n\n\n[1] Christensen, Henrik I. , et al. \"Approximation and online algorithms for multidimensional bin packing: A survey.\" Computer Science Review 24.May(2017):63-79.\n\n[2] Epstein, Leah , Csan\u00e1d Imreh, and A.

Optimizing  $\\sum_{ij} \\log p_{ij} \\cdot \\hat{p}_{ij}$ \n\nwill make the $L_m$ too small so that it will be harder to set the balance coefficient of  $L_{m}$  and  $L_{ce}$.

                        "value": "**Q3:  How to calculate $p_{\\theta}$ in section 4.3.2?**\n\nWe are very sorry that we don't make it clear in our paper. \n- $\\pi$ represents the **solution** generated by cluster decode strategy. \n- $p_\\theta$ is the **probability of generating a packing sequence** based on the heat-map according to the cluster decode strategy. \n- $p_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t,w)$ in section 4.3.2 is determined by the maximum value of the sum of the connection strengths corresponding to all items in the latest opened bin, as mentioned in section 4.3.1. \n\nOnce the heat-map is obtained, a packing solution $\\pi$ can be decoded by the cluster decoder deterministically, with $p_\\theta$ calculated by $\\prod_{t=1}^{N}{p_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t,w)}$. After obtaining this probability $p_\\theta$, the Policy Gradient can be leveraged to adjust the the non-fixed parameters of network so that the output of the network (heat-map) will be changed. Then the cluster-decoder is leveraged based on this 'new' heat-map to generate a 'new' packing solution. This procedure is repeated iteratively until no significant improvement of the solution. \n\nThanks again for reminding us the detail, it will help us enhance the precision of the manuscript."

We would appreciate your feedback on whether our response has addressed your concerns.\n\nIn response to your comments, we have answered your concerns and improved the paper in the following aspects:\n\n* We provided more introduction about CCBPP both **from academic view** and **from application view**.\n\n* We clarified that it would be hard to balance the coefficient $\\lambda$ of the two losses $L_m$ and $L_{ce}$, so we still chose to optimize $\\sum_{ij} p_{ij} \\cdot \\hat{p}_{ij}$\n\n* We clarified the calculation of $p_{\\theta}$, and added modified this part in the revision of our manuscript.\n\nThanks again for your valuable review. We are looking forward to your response and are happy to answer any future questions."
