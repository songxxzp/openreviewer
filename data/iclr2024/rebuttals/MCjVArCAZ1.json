                    "value": "The paper conducts a comprehensive examination of the effectiveness of pre-trained (PT) models in comparison to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) within the realm of few-shot learning. Despite prevailing beliefs suggesting the dominance of PT models, this study provides an unbiased comparison by employing identical architecture and ensuring complete model training. The research uses a robust statistical methodology, specifically the effect size (Cohen\u2019s d), to discern the practical differences between PT and MAML models. A \"diversity coefficient\" metric is used to define the formal diversity of datasets. Key findings highlight that for datasets with low formal diversity, PT models slightly outperform MAML. Conversely, in scenarios with high formal diversity, MAML tends to be more effective. However, the magnitude of these differences is marginal, with an effect size less than 0.2. When evaluating the overall performance across various dataset diversities, neither method exhibits a clear advantage. The authors conclude that the inherent diversity of datasets is an important factor in determining the efficacy of PT versus MAML models."

However, it is somehow limited in terms of novelty as it does not introduce any new techniques or analyses.\n\nA1: We respectfully differ. For instance, we have introduced a novel method of comparing two algorithms via the effect size, which we believe is more robust to sample size than p-values and confidence intervals (as described in Section 3.2). Furthermore, our paper also introduces a Task2Vec-based diversity coefficient that measures the task diversity of a given few-shot benchmark. We further present a detailed effect size-based statistical analysis of performance that gives substantial support to our claim that meta-learning outperforms pretraining if the data diversity is large enough.\n\nQ2: A significant limitation of the paper lies in its reliance on two methodologies, MAML and PT with fine-tuning restricted to the head, which may not represent the current best practices in the field. Firstly, while MAML is undoubtedly foundational in meta-learning, its relevance has waned over time.

A juxtaposition against these state-of-the-art techniques would have been insightful. These oversights are critical as the paper's primary conclusions might shift when evaluated against more contemporary, optimized methods.\n\nA2: We see this paper as a direct response to existing work that claims that meta-learning methods are worse than pre-training approaches, using equivalent methods to ours ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11539 ). We propose the use of better experimental methods to allow a fair comparison between the techniques and show a reversal of what are now folklore conclusions. We note that the use of MAML as opposed to other meta-learning methods furthers our claim, since MAML is the simplest meta-learning approach. If MAML can outperform pre-training, better meta-learners should be able to do so too. Please find more details about this in the appendix, section A.6, paragraph 2.\n\nQ3: The presentation of data exclusively in tabular format, though beneficial for transparency, hinders a quick understanding of the trends. I recommend the authors to enhance data representation by incorporating visual aids, such as scatter plots. This would facilitate a more intuitive grasp of the data patterns. The tables could be conveniently relocated to the appendix to maintain thoroughness without overwhelming the main content.\n\nA3: Thanks for the suggestions. We have moved the detailed results to the appendix, leaving only tables providing a concise and easy to understand summary for our results in the main paper. We have additionally added plots indicating the spread of effect size for each of our 2 categories of diversity. Hoping this makes our results clearer and easier to understand.\n\nQ4: There are some formatting issues, e.g. (i) Table 6 should be within the body of the paper, (ii) in the text \"Meta-Data set\" should be replaced with \"Meta-Dataset\"\n\nA4: Thanks for pointing this out. We have fixed these issues in the revision."

Most of the contributions listed in the rebuttal look to me like variations of techniques that already existed. For instance, in the answer you claim that Task2Vec is one of the contribution of the paper. However, as far as I know this was developed by Achille et al. (2019) and Miranda et al. (2022), so I am not sure if can count as a novel contribution. Moreover, if the primary contribution of your work is methodological, it might be beneficial to reorient the paper to emphasize how your proposed analytical techniques provide broad utility beyond existing methods. This reorientation could better highlight the novel aspects of your work.\n\n2) Regarding comparison with other methods. My observation was mainly about comparing against more effective fine-tuning methods. As I mentioned in my review, fine-tuning only the head is a very simple baseline and there are much more effective methods out there (e.g. Kolesnikov et al. 2020, Shysheya et al. 2022). The main conclusion of the paper, that meta-learning outperforms fine-tuning, may not hold when state-of-the-art techinques come into play.\n\nAlessandro Achille, Michael Lam, Rahul Tewari, Avinash Ravichandran, Subhransu Maji, Stefano Soatto, and Pietro Perona.

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer RzB7 for the insightful comments. Below is our response: \n\nQ1. No novel methods are introduced in this paper, which itself is ok if the results are intriguing.\n\nA1. We respectfully differ. For instance, we have introduced a novel method of comparing two algorithms via the effect size, which we believe is more robust to sample size than p-values and confidence intervals (as described in Section 3.2). Furthermore, our paper also introduces a Task2Vec-based diversity coefficient that measures the task diversity of a given few-shot benchmark. We further present a detailed effect size-based statistical analysis of performance that gives substantial support to our claim that meta-learning outperforms pretraining if the data diversity is large enough.\n\nQ2.  Presentation of the results is very poor. All results are just listed in tables, and there are no attempts to present the results in a comprehensible/impressive manner. Since I could not find any meaningful insight from the tables, I recommend adding more comprehensive figures which should be contributions of the paper\u2026\n\nA2. Thanks for the suggestions. We have moved the detailed results to the appendix, leaving only tables providing a concise and easy to understand summary for our results in the main paper.  We\u2019ve added box plots and violin plots (Figure 1) to address this issue. We have additionally added plots indicating the spread of effect size for each of our 2 categories of diversity. Hoping this makes our results clearer and easier to understand.\n\n\nQ3. The results of Cohen's d can be caused from (1) meta-training dataset, and/or (2) meta-test dataset, in addition to learning algorithms, but I could not find which factor causes the results of Cohen's d. In other words, which diversity of meta-training datasets or meta-testing datasets makes the difference between the two methods?\n\nA3. We use the meta-training dataset to compute the Task2Vec diversity for each few-shot benchmark, as we believe that the data diversity of the meta-training should be the influencing factor that allows the meta-learner to meta-learn better. Since each few-shot task for meta-training and meta-testing is sampled from the same few-shot benchmark, the diversity of the test and training splits should be more or less the same."

A different statistical tool, Cohen's d, is used to assess performance differences. The usage of Cohen's d/effect sizes is because t-tests can result in very small p values/confidence intervals when the number of samples compared is large (which it is in this case).\n* To study this question, the paper considers many different FSL datasets (21 totally) and compares the performance of PT models to MAML models.  The paper also evaluates the diversity score of datasets as a tool to help interpret the results, based on Task2vec (Miranda et al 2022). \n* The key finding is that PT models are not always better than MAML-styled metalearned models (based on the effect size score for the comparisons). in particular, one class may perform better than the other as a function of the diversity of the dataset considered."

Choice of MAML model: the original MAML model has been developed significantly in recent years. It would be fairer to that class of methods to compare to one of these many developments, given they have demonstrated (in general) better performance. \n\nA1. We aim to counter a rising belief that meta-learning approaches are always worse than pre-training approaches. To do so, we pick the simplest meta-learning approach, MAML, and show that it can perform better than pre-training in high diversity settings. This is sufficient to counter the belief, since if MAML can outperform pre-training, so can the other meta-learning algorithms.\n\nQ2. A discussion of the drawbacks of effect size -- it is useful to understand where this may be inadequate (except the fact that one must choose a threshold level). Relatedly, the paper states that standard effect sizes are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, but it is unclear how the choice of 1% relates to these.\n\nA2. We acknowledge the reviewer\u2019s point that it is important to understand the limitations of using any statistical test. One of the major limitations of using effect sizes is that they can be misleading if considered in isolation of other metrics such as meta-test accuracies. We present these values in the appendix, section A.2. We further note that, as with any other statistical test, we need to define arbitrary thresholds for the interpretation of effect sizes. While the common values are 0.2,0.5,0.8, we have used the 1% threshold as a decision rule based on it being common to accept papers due to 1% differences in machine learning. We have provided a detailed description of our choice of the 1% threshold in the appendix, section A.6, paragraph 3. Note that the choice of 1% doesn\u2019t affect our primary results, in which we report average of raw effect size values. \n\n\tWe highlight and answer the aforementioned issues in detail in Section 3.2 of our paper.\n\n\nQ3. Presentation of experimental setup: given this paper is primarily related to empirical benchmarking, a summary of the experimental setup in the main paper would help contextualise the investigation.

We have added a brief explanation to the caption of table 1.\n\t\nQ5.

We have additionally moved the detailed results to the appendix, leaving only tables providing a concise and easy to understand summary for our results in the main paper.

Training to convergence: ... If models experience some sort of overfitting, perhaps it makes sense to do early stopping?\n\nA6. All datasets used in this paper have a sufficient number of examples per class for our models to be resistant to overfitting. We further back this claim by noting that we do not see poor test performance as should be expected for overfitting. Since our models do not overfit, it doesn\u2019t make sense to implement early stopping, which would also otherwise hinder our ability to do a fair comparison between the two techniques. In addition, fitting the data perfectly is a standard procedure for ResNet & vision models on classification tasks.\n\nQ7. Minor: ... use vs rapid learning\n\nA7. We have added the citation in, thanks for the catch!"

What is the main principle behind the new test? Specifically, if it rejects a hypothesis, what can we tell about its confidence in doing so? For example, using t-test, we are implicitly assuming the performance differences follows a student-t distribution and the t-statistic basically tells us if we can reject the null hypothesis at a certain confidence level? Do we have a similar principle under the new test?\n\n3. For the task space with high diversity, I tend to think that the pre-training would not be effective will small architecture for obvious reason. Thus, the statistic test should only be applied to the reported performance on the best model architecture for pre-training (but across different test domains) -- right now, it seems the performance report on ResNet50 would favor pre-training; and the conclusion that meta-learning is better is mostly likely caused by the included performance on lower-complexity ResNet structure."

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer ZnA1 for the insightful comments. Below is our response: \n\nQ1: Can the authors elaborate more on why p-value & confidence interval would become zero on larger batch size?\n\nA1: As the batch size increases, our sample size gets larger, and we tend to see that the confidence interval becomes zero (which can sometimes misleadingly suggest that the differences between two groups is significant - see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00199-5). As addressed in Section 3.2, effect size is less affected by sample size which alleviates this drawback.  \n\nQ2: Please elaborate on the main principle behind a new test (i.e., its underlying assumption regarding the distribution of performance difference between two algorithms + what can we say about the confidence in rejecting the null hypothesis)\n\nA2: Section 3.2 addresses why effect size is a good metric (compared to confidence intervals) to compare MAML and PT. In summary, effect size provides a way of quantifying the difference between the two algorithms - if the absolute value of the effect size is greater than the calculated standardized 1% threshold, we reject the null hypothesis. The effect size also quantifies the magnitude of the difference - the standard values are 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 for a small, medium, and large effect size difference.\n\nQ3: For high diversity setting, I think the statistic test should be based only on the best model architecture. Please consider revising this part of the evaluation protocol\n\nA3: Our goal in this paper is to provide a fair comparison between pre-training and meta-learning, and to provide empirical evidence to the fact that meta-learning outperforms pre-training if the data diversity is large enough. We define a fair comparison as using the same model, same optimizer and training to convergence. We hence provide comparisons with different models and with different data diversities to conclude that high diversity and small architectures should lead to better meta-learning performance. With bigger architectures, the difference between meta-learning and pre-training is less pronounced due to the possibility of pre-trained models to meta-overfit."
