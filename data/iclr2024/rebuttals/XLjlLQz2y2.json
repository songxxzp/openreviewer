                    "value": "This paper contributes with a novel approach to select training nodes in a very large graph, where \nthe processing of all of them via GNNs leads to OOM (Out-of-memory).  This problem is known as \n\"coreset selection\" in the literature. The typical setting is to learn non-negative weights leading to \nminimize the deviation between the \"as per node loss\" and the training loss (empirical risk): zero weight\nmeans that the training node is not informative for learning. This is consistent with the \"locality principle\"\nof GNNs where node embeddings mostly rely on those of their neighbors. The authors leverage this principle \nby building quasi-independent node samples: aking subgraphs around training nodes and considering only \nthe features of the nodes in each subgraph. In particular, they propose to limit the subgraphs to ego-graphs (close \nnodes, e.g. shortest path). \n\nThe main contribution of the paper is as follows. The authors formulate the coreset selection problems in terms of finding\nlocal embeddings close to real ones (under the assumption that the error of this approximation is bounded). This is explained\nvia the spectral domain of the embedding, and this leads in turn to minimize an upper bound which is independent of the spectral \nembeddings themselves: it depends on the diffusion (transition) matrix P. The minimization is done by a variant of the greedy geodesic iterative ascent (GIGA) algorithm. \n\nThe proposed algorithm is proven to outperform with other coreset selection algorithms, but in mid-sized such as Flicker. It is also tested\nwith very large graph where its greedy nature provides efficiency wrt the alternatives."

In order to avoid node-dependence issues, as is typical, the authors look at ego-nets and pick the entire neighborhood at once. They then transform the search problem into the spectral space, which makes it easier to use submodular optimization (and greedy algorithm) and avoid redundancy. The intuition is that far-away nodes are less redundant (hence prior work based on k-means and k-center for coreset construction). Unlike previous work on graph condensation, this work looks at multiple hops in the ego-net, which reduces the \"complexity\" of the optimization problem by introducing a smoothness condition. This relies on the typical assumption that GNN essentially computes a \"local\" function. The multi-hop ego-net, though, adds to the size of the data, which the authors claim can be reduced by PCA."

More concretely, the authors define the coreset for GNN as a subset of labeled nodes, and the goal is to select a small coreset so that if we train the model with the loss computed only on the coreset, the testing accuracy should be similar to training on the full labeled set. The authors cast this as an optimization problem. The problem is intractable so the author simplifies the problem significantly according to some observations and assumptions. Then using existing techniques to obtain the coreset. In the experiments, the proposed coreset framework exhibits certain advantages over other graph reduction techniques for training GNNs."

Basically, it only aims to reduce the size of the training set, but at training time, the ego-graphs of them still need to be loaded, which could still be huge because of the neighbor explosion phenomenon. This is also the reason why plain mini-batch training is not applicable in the first place. The coreset problem proposed in this paper doesn't solve the memory usage challenge faced by mini-batch training techniques.\n\n2. That being said, in the experiments, the authors should report the total size of ego-graphs. In this paper the percentage of labeled nodes  (among the entire training set) is considered as the key compression ratio, but this does not really reflect the memory usage in the case when mini-batch training is already inapplicable. \n\n3. The motivation of the proposed method is to scale up GNN training; however, from the empirically results, the proposed method has similar performance as uniform sampling on two largest data sets, namely arxiv and products. Moreover, the accuracy on these two datasets and Reddit are much lower than full graph training, e.g., 53 vs. 75 on products. From the official leader board, even MLP can achieve 61.\n\n4. The proposed method relies on a strong assumption (assumption 1), which is verified only on Cora a very small graph. I think this might not be the case on large graphs, which are the main target of the proposed methods. This could also be the reason why the proposed method has poor performance on relatively large datasets."
