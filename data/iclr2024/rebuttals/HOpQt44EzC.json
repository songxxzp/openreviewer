                    "value": "The paper presents a novel approach for learning differentially private vision-foundation models via image captioning. The key innovation of the method is the use of an image captioning objective that enables the direct application of DP-SGD, since the loss is an additive function over the samples. Compared to the existing approach of using a masked autoencoder objective, the proposed image caption objective not only enables vision-language tasks, but allows for the use of much larger batch sizes during model training, without degrading the model performance, which greatly reduces the effective noise per training iteration, leading to better privacy-utility tradeoffs. In experimental evaluations on downstream vision and vision-language tasks, the method achieves SoTA performance relative to DP baselines and, on some tasks, even comparable performance to non-private models."

The only insight of the paper is that image captioning is a suitable loss for DP training.*\n\n**A1**: The vast majority of existing work on DP training operates on a single modality, be it image classification, image-only SSL, text classification, language modeling, etc. Our work is the first to push beyond this barrier and show that DP can also be successfully applied to the currently mainstream paradigm of multimodal learning. We intentionally stuck to well-established and proven techniques for this purpose, using the standard DP-SGD algorithm and Renyi privacy accounting, and the Cap algorithm for image captioning pre-training. By doing so, we hope to establish a strong baseline for DP pre-training on multimodal data, and lay the groundwork for future research by releasing our code/model so that others can build upon our successful training recipe.\n\nNevertheless, our work does reveal several novel and interesting findings regarding the suitability of image captioning for large-scale DP training, including its ability to scale to massive batch sizes as large as 1.3M, and its synergy with the TAN simulation framework for efficient exploration of training algorithms and hyperparameters. These findings, although not novel in terms of techniques, are crucial for future research since they collectively form a comprehensive strategy for scaling up DP training.\n\n>**Q2**: *What is the reason for the dilemma of large batch training in DP-SGD, and how does image captioning solve this dilemma? Can you provide any insights?*\n\n**A2**: The observation that training with massive batches can deteriorate the performance with DP-SGD [SSS2023] is also present in the non private literature, e.g. with SGD. DP-Cap exhibits robust scaling capabilities concerning batch size, contributing to its success. Our intuition is that a captioner training resembles a language model training, which can usually deal with larger batches. We believe that the same observation could be made for classical (non-private) SGD. \n\n>**Q3**: *Would combining the MAE and image captioning objectives lead to even better performance?*\n\n**A3**: We thank the reviewer for this interesting observation.  It would mean performing backpropagation on the sum of these two losses, from image reconstruction and captioning. Intuitively, we would expect that this joint optimization may not be inherently advantageous, given that image representations learned from reconstruction and captioning are not necessarily similar. It is also an interesting question outside of the scope of DP that is worth exploring.\n\nWe hope that we have adequately addressed the queries posed by the reviewer. We are readily available for any further discussions or clarifications as needed. Please note that we have also added a general response that details the changes in the revised manuscript. \n\n[SSS2023] TAN Without a Burn: Scaling Laws of DP-SGD.

Our research breaks through this limitation, marking the first successful application of DP for multimodal learning. Deliberately relying on established techniques, like the standard DP-SGD algorithm with Renyi DP accounting and the Cap algorithm for image captioning pre-training, we aim to set a robust benchmark for DP pre-training on multimodal data.

Notably, its capability to scale to massive batch sizes, reaching up to 1.3 million, and its synergistic relationship with the TAN simulation framework for efficient exploration of training algorithms and hyperparameters.

As the topic of copyright/privacy is inherently multidisciplinary, the choice of solution must be acceptable not only to the research community, but also in the eyes of law practitioners and regulators. DP stands out in this regard as the only existing solution that is not only provably rigorous and thus scientifically appealing, but also enjoyed adoption as the gold standard for privacy protection by organizations such as the US Census Bureau, Google, Apple, etc. [Des21, CDE+2023]. The goal of our paper is to push the boundary of DP foundation model training and bring this gold standard notion closer to current practice in ML.\n\nWe would like to emphasize that even though DP training indeed performs inferior to non-DP training, the latter may be prohibited by law or policy when applied to private data. Thus, it is more appropriate to view the non-DP result as the maximum attainable model performance rather than as a baseline. In practice, however, a portion of the training data may be publicly accessible. In such situations, a natural way to apply our findings is to initialize the model by non-DP training on the public data, then fine-tune with DP on the private data.\n\n[Des21] Damien Desfontaines.

                        "value": ">**Q3**: *As shown in Appendix A.1, the authors used 128 V100 GPUs for training the model. As a result of the huge amount of demanded GPUs, it would be difficult for most of the researchers in this area to follow this work. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3(b), the proposed method has similar loss values across different batch sizes. Therefore, it would be interesting to see if the proposed method can achieve similar performances with smaller batch size. If so, more researchers would be able to follow and further improve this work.*\n\n**A3**: Differentially Private training indeed places a significant computational burden, and our aspiration is that the foundational models trained with DP can be a one-time investment. In our work, we used the strategy from [SSS2023] to simulate training with smaller batches to alleviate the computational cost associated with HP search. The curves we plot in Figure 3.b. for smaller batches serve as a basis for this simulation, but do not have reasonable strict privacy guarantees. However, in settings where the simulation can closely match the result obtained with large batch training, it may be possible to conduct exploratory research entirely via simulation using much less compute. \n\n>**Q4**: *As discussed in the \u201cweakness\u201d part, is there any other promising framework/method that could overcome the copyright/privacy issues of large foundation models? If so, why do the authors choose DP-based methods in this manuscript?*\n\n**A4**: See answer to **Q2**. There are some alternative privacy-preserving ML notions  but they are not as rigorous and widely accepted as DP. We fully agree with the reviewer that DP has several caveats, but hope that our paper shows promise for its application in large scale settings.\n\n>**Q5**: *I would expect the authors to further clarify the technical novelty of the proposed method.*\n\n**A5**: See answer to **Q1**. \n\nWe hope that we have adequately addressed the queries posed by the reviewer. We are readily available for any further discussions or clarifications as needed. Please note that we have also added a general response that details the changes in the revised manuscript. \n\n\n[SSS2023] TAN Without a Burn: Scaling Laws of DP-SGD.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and questions.\n\n>**Q1**: *\u201cThere may be fairness issues in experimental comparisons. For example, the paper states that DP-Cap and ViP were trained using the same training dataset and privacy budget. However, it is worth noting that ViP was trained without utilizing captions (If I understand correctly), while DP-Cap leveraged both images and captions. Consequently, the observed performance improvement of DP-Cap compared to ViP could be attributed to the additional information used during training. While this improved performance may be seen as a contribution of DP-Cap, it is important to consider that the privacy risk might have increased since the model learned caption information.\u201d*\n\n**A1**: $\\varepsilon$-DP bounds the amount of information extracted from each training sample by $\\varepsilon$. Notably, for DP-Cap, each sample is made of {image + caption}, while ViP utilizes {image} only. Consequently, DP-Cap inherently offers an equivalent or better privacy guarantee for each image. One way to see it is to note that DP provides protection against membership inference attacks [SSS+2017]. Suppose $\\varepsilon$-DP upper bounds the success rate of a membership inference attack (when given the image-text pair) against DP-Cap as $\\leq p$. Then the MIA success rate when given only the image can be at most $p$ since the attacker has strictly less information. This is exactly the upper bound for the success rate of a membership inference attack against ViP. In other words, any attacker that can attack the {image+caption} models (such as DP-Cap) can also attack the image only models (such as ViP). \n\nOn the other hand, since the {image+caption} models utilize the caption, the privacy leakage from the text part of the image-caption pair is non-zero for $\\varepsilon>0$. It is worth noting that in our set up since we use DP, we protect the captions with the same $\\varepsilon$-DP guarantee. Thus, the privacy protection for DP-Cap is neither strictly stronger nor strictly weaker than that for ViP, so the two privacy notions are not directly comparable.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this remark, and are adding this precision in the revised manuscript (Section A.1).\n\n>**Q2**: *\u201cThe effectiveness of the proposed method appears to lack a thorough analysis. In Figure 1(a), the accuracies of DP-Cap are reported as 0.58 and 0.33 under 'random init' and 'syn init' on ImageNet. It is evident that 'syn init' significantly contributes to DP-Cap's performance improvement. However, it's worth considering that 'syn init' is derived from the paper proposing ViP. An important question arises: if both ViP and DP-Cap were not to utilize 'syn init,' what impact would it have on their final results?\"\u201d*\n\n**A2**: We have observed that training with DP on top of synthetic initialization leads to significantly better results for DP-Cap compared to ViP. To answer the reviewer\u2019s question, this superiority also appears when the models are trained from scratch: the improvement over ViP is even larger when training without syn-init. For instance, when trained from random initialization, ViP reaches 23.9% for full linear probing, while we achieve 47.0%. It naturally underscores the fact that our captioning approach is significantly better for differentially private representation learning for vision data. We acknowledge the significance of this observation. We have incorporated it into the updated paper for clarity, and added more numbers for comparison in Table 8 (Section B).\n\n>**Q3**: *Typos. For example: The citation formats for some related papers appear to be incorrect. Is the double line in Table 1 positioned correctly?\"*\n\n**A3**: We thank the reviewer for these typos; we are happy to correct the citations. Could you please clarify which specific related work you are referring to? For the double line, we wanted to highlight that ViP and DP-Cap are both private models pretrained on LAION.\n\n[SSS+2017] Reza Shokri, Marco Stronati, Congzheng Song, Vitaly Shmatikov.

Or the motivation of the experiments is not clear. \n\nFor example, we observe the foundation model achieve better performance on some vision tasks compared to the original transformer based architecture, which has been observed on ImageNet-1K classification problem. Exactly on this dataset, it should firstly show the traditional classification task compared to other DP methods, and then go for few-shot setting.\n\nCurrently, only reporting the ImageNet-1K on few-shot setting with very low numbers (e.g., in Table 3), cannot lead to any positive conclusion.\n\n3. Some experiments comparison cannot draw any conclusion, e.g., Table 2 compared between DP-Cap and the non-DP based methods.\n\n4. One consideration is to replicate the experimental settings from ViP, e.g., DP fine-tuning evaluation on ImageNet-1K, experiments on Caltech-101 and CIFAR-100, which can provide direct comparison to ViP and other DP methods, as appeared in ViP paper.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for providing valuable suggestions and comments.\n\n>**Q1**: *\"The novelty of the paper seems not fully justified. For example, in DP guarantee, what is the difference between DP-Cap and ViP?\"*\n\n**A1**: The novelty of our work lies in building the first differentially private vision-language foundation model, and demonstrating that such models can learn way better private vision encoders compared to previous state-of-the-art DP methods. Regarding the DP guarantee, $\\varepsilon$-DP bounds the amount of information extracted from each training sample by $\\varepsilon$. Notably, for DP-Cap, each sample is made of {image + caption}, while ViP utilizes {image} only. Consequently, DP-Cap inherently offers an equivalent or better privacy guarantee for each image. One way to see it is to note that DP provides protection against membership inference attacks [SSS+2017]. Suppose $\\varepsilon$-DP upper bounds the success rate of a membership inference attack (when given the image-text pair) against DP-Cap as $\\leq p$. Then the MIA success rate when given only the image can be at most $p$ since the attacker has strictly less information. This is exactly the upper bound for the success rate of a membership inference attack against ViP. In other words, any attacker that can attack the {image+caption} models (such as DP-Cap) can also attack the image only models (such as ViP). \n\nOn the other hand, since the {image+caption} models utilize the caption, the privacy leakage from the text part of the image-caption pair is non-zero for $\\varepsilon>0$. It is worth noting that in our set up since we use DP, we protect the captions with the same $\\varepsilon$-DP guarantee. Thus, the privacy protection for DP-Cap is neither strictly stronger nor strictly weaker than that for ViP, so the two privacy notions are not directly comparable.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this remark, and are adding this precision in the revised manuscript (Section A.1).\n\n>**Q2**: *\"Under what architecture or updating mechanism design, DP-Cap can claim the novelty or difference?\"*\n\n**A2**: The vast majority of existing work on DP training operates on a single modality, be it image classification, image-only SSL, text classification, language modeling, etc. Our work is the first to push beyond this barrier and show that DP can also be successfully applied to the currently mainstream paradigm of multimodal learning. We intentionally stuck to well-established and proven techniques for this purpose, using the standard DP-SGD algorithm and Renyi privacy accounting, and the Cap algorithm for image captioning pre-training. By doing so, we hope to establish a strong baseline for DP pre-training on multimodal data, and lay the groundwork for future research by releasing our code/model so that others can build upon our successful training recipe.\n\nNevertheless, our work does reveal several novel and interesting findings regarding the suitability of image captioning for large-scale DP training, including its ability to scale to massive batch sizes as large as 1.3M, and its synergy with the TAN simulation framework for efficient exploration of training algorithms and hyperparameters. These findings, although not novel in terms of techniques, are crucial for future research since they collectively form a comprehensive strategy for scaling up DP training.\n\n\n[SSS+2017] Reza Shokri, Marco Stronati, Congzheng Song, Vitaly Shmatikov.

In response, we have incorporated fine-tuning experiments into the revised version, Table 9 in Section B.1. As shown in the updated results, DP-Cap improves over ViP on few-shot fine-tuning tasks. \n\nAddressing the concern about the perceived low numbers in few-shot learning, it's crucial to underscore that these figures hold significant importance for benchmarking quality of learned image representations in the self-supervised learning literature, e.g., [ACM+2022]. While the results in Figure 1(a) and Table 4 may appear modest compared with non-private baseline methods, they represent a noteworthy stride towards closing the performance gap with the non private representations as well as improving existing state-of-the-art DP vision foundation models (ViPs). Note that, as detailed in the general comment, we have fixed a bug in the loss scaling which has considerably improved the performance of the vision encoder across all benchmarks. For instance, we now achieve a performance of 63.4% on ImageNet full linear probing\u2014a nearly 8% improvement over ViP.\n\n\n>**Q4**: *\u201cSome experiments comparison cannot draw any conclusion, e.g., Table 2 compared between DP-Cap and the non-DP based methods.\u201d*\n\n**A4**: It is a common practice to report the non-private model performance in the differential privacy literature, which provides information about the performance gap between private models and non-private models. Thank you for your question, we have added a remark on the non-private models to improve presentation clarity in Section B1.\n\nWe hope that we have adequately addressed the queries posed by the reviewer. We are readily available for any further discussions or clarifications as needed.\n\n[ACM+2022] Masked siamese networks for label-efficient learning.
