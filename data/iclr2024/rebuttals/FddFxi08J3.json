In recent years it has been studied in connection to the expressibility of graph neural networks. This paper studies the higher dimensional variant k-WL, where instead of nodes the information is passed between k-tuples of nodes. This variant has been associated with \"higher-order GNNs\", a generalization GNNs where correspondingly, messages are passed between sets of nodes. The paper is theoretical and proves some results about the \"WL dimension\" of graph substructures, which is the smallest k such the k-WL test can distinguish between graphs that have a different number of copies of that substructure. The results concern to variants like induced versus non-induced substructures, whether\u00a0the number of copies can be computed, and whether the WL dimension of a substructures can be computed efficiently."

Furthermore, as we have mentioned in our response to Reviewer 2nvm, we posit that our results can serve as valuable insights for the development of novel GNN architectures capable of capturing specific graph motif parameters. Presenting our results at ICLR can provide us with a valuable chance to engage in direct conversations about the theoretical and practical implications of our work with the people involved in designing GNN architectures.

The motivation for studying the k-WL test is the connection to the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs).\n\nBuilding on recent results for unlabeled graphs, this paper characterizes the class of graph motifs that can be computed by the k-WL test for labeled graphs (i.e., with edge and vertex labels). A central quantity is the WL-dimension of the graph motif parameter $\\Gamma$, which is the smallest $k$ for which a k-WL test returns distinct outputs for graphs which induce distinct values of $\\Gamma$. In Theorem 2, the authors show that the WL-dimension of $\\Gamma$ is equal to the maximum treewidth of any of the subgraphs in the support of $\\Gamma$. In Theorem 6, the authors show that the result of the WL test can be used to compute the value of $\\Gamma$ as well (alone, the $k$-WL can only distinguish between different values of $\\Gamma$). In their final set of results, the authors turn to the more specific question of subgraph counting. Theorem 8 shows that it can be determined whether a labeled graph has WL-dimension at most $k$ in polynomial time. Proposition 9 examines the popular task of counting graphlets, and shows that counting k-graphlets has WL-dimension k - 1."

Together, Theorems 2, 6 and 8 show that one can determine an appropriate value of $k$ in polynomial time for the motif-counting task at hand, and can then compute it using a modification of the k-WL test.

These are only hinted at, but given the audience of this paper, it would be worthwhile to have some discussion about it.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We agree that the paper would benefit from some further discussion of this point. We see the implications on two levels. High-level, our results resolve many questions around the theoretical limits of what can be expressed by GNNs.\nOn a more concrete level, we believe that our results serve as a foundation to analyze, unify and shape the increasingly popular area of GNNs that are enriched with structural information about the input graph, such as Graph Substructure Networks (Bouritsas et al., 2022)  or GNNs with local graph parameters (Barcel\u00f3 et al., 2021).\nThe motif parameter view can be seen as a list of pieces of information that are necessary to determine a function. It can thus allow us to precisely relate additional structural information that is injected into a GNN to the resulting change in expressivity. \nWe will add respective discussions to the paper.\n\n> Is $hom(F_i, G)$ defined somehwere?\n\nYes, in the last line of the penultimate sentence of page 3. We have defined Hom(F,G) for the set of homomorphisms from F to G and homs(F,G) for the number of such homomorphisms.\n\n> In the definition of tree decomposition on page 5, [...]\n\nThanks! Indeed, there is a typo. It should be $u,v \\in \\alpha(t)$ or { $u,v$ } $\\subseteq \\alpha(t) $\n\n> Is there any quick intuition for why treewidth is the right determinant of the WL-dimension?\n\nHigh level, the key idea is that for any graph F with treewidth k, we know that if G and H are equivalent under kWL, homs(F,G) = homs(F,H) (due to Dvo\u0159\u00e1k and Dell, Grohe, Rattan). At the same time the homomorphism distinguishing closedness property of treewidth implies that this is tight, in the sense that for any k\u2019 < k there are graphs G,H that are k\u2019WL equivalent but homs(F,G) \\neq homs(F,H). \n\nFor the first statement, the intuition is that kWL equivalence means (oversimplified) that the local view of at most (k+1) nodes at a time are the same in G and H. This means that in a tree decomposition for F, the possible local assignments of each bag for G and for H will be isomorphic. Since these local assignments in a decomposition determine the homomorphisms from F, the number will be the same.\n\nFor the second statement we are unfortunately not aware of any convincing intuition. The argument is highly technical and relies on the combination of a number of elements that are already individually difficult to grasp intuitively (e.g., oddomorphisms, the algebraic characterisation of homomorphism mentioned above)."

                        "value": "> The novelty of this work isn't clear to me. While the extension to labeled graphs is well-motivated, the results and techniques seem to be obtained by simple / straightforward extensions of recent work for unlabeled graphs. Can you describe what the key roadblocks and innovations are in this setting? This would make it easier to judge the contributions of this work.\n\nOn a technical level the extension is not as straightforward as it seems in the high-level view. From Neuen\u2019s proof of the unlabeled case we can reuse only the fact that the property of having treewidth at most k is closed under weak oddomorphisms. However, the underlying series of results by Roberson, from which it follows that this closure implies homomorphism distinguishing closedness needs to be extended to the labeled setting. \n\nThis first requires us to adapt the construction of the CCFI graphs for the labeled case, which is non-trivial as there are multiple natural ways to generalize the unlabeled construction. In particular, in the unlabeled construction vertices are of the form (v,S) for all S that are  subsets of edges incident to v s.t. S satisfies some technical property. The generalization that we describe is arguably not even the most natural candidate as it ignores the edge labels in the definition of these vertices (the labels are of course used in a later, separate, part of the construction). However, it seems necessary to choose this less natural construction from a technical perspective.\n\nFor this modified construction, we then need to reprove the key theorem of this oddomorphism framework. Notably, the main arguments are not combinatorial but instead rely on an algebraic characterization of homomorphisms into the CCFI constructions. The role of labels in this argumentation is thus less straightforward than one might expect and requires careful reproving (and subtle modifications) of a whole series of results. Furthermore, the construction of CCFI (and especially the algebraic characterisation) would be further complicated by the presence of vertex labels. We therefore technically split the argument in showing the case without vertex-labels, and then reducing the general labeled case to this case with only edge labels.\n\nIn addition to this technical development which takes up a significant part of the technical appendix, Lemmas 4 and 5 also need to be lifted to their labeled version, which require different techniques (for Lemma 4 this is considered folklore in the context of parameterised counting, but the reasoning is not easily accessible to the intended audience of this paper). The arguments for Lemma 7 do not immediately build on any closely related results. \n\nFinally we believe that the Theorem 8 and Proposition 9 serve as illustrations for why we believe that this work serves as an important foundational contribution to the study of GNN expressiveness. Linking GNNs to recent work in counting complexity via the framework of graph motif parameters allows for relatively simple proofs of a notable open problem in the area (Thm 8), as well as an expressivity question that seemed entirely out of reach with previous methods (Prop 9)."

About previous work: The only result we are aware of that relates to the task of counting the number of appearances of a pattern inside a graph is one given by Chen et al in the paper \u201cCan graph neural networks count substructures?\u201d. It is shown in such a paper that a GNN that performs local relational pooling over neighborhoods of the given graph G of radius at most the radius of the pattern p can count the number of occurrences of p in G. Our result is slightly different, as it shows that if the support of p only contains graphs of treewidth k then the number of occurrences of p in a graph G can be obtained from the result of a standard pooling function that counts the number of tuples of each color in the result of the WL test over G."

[...]\n\nPlease see our reply to Reviewer 2nvm, for a discussion of some of the key technical differences regarding Neuen (2023) specifically. \n\n> Comment: Typically in homomorphism literature, a \"labeled graph\" refers to a graph with certain vertices marked with labels 1,...,k. [...]\n\nThank you very much for the suggestion. We indeed already make this remark in the appendix since we actually also use the notion described in the comment (although renamed to k-marked to avoid a clash of terms). But we agree that the potential for confusion is high and that this should be clarified already in the main body of the paper."

Considering the lack of experimental work/applications, I suggest that the authors should exactly pinpoint the relevance of their results to the GNN community in a separate paragraph within the introduction."
