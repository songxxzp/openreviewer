The accuracy metrics indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other comparable approaches and that the verification performance is better on the synthetic fingerprints compared to the real fingerprints."

                    "value": "This manuscript has following high-level weaknesses that need to be addressed in any revision.\n\n1. Fingerprint verification accuracy on FVC test dataset is worse than on SFinGe test dataset. While I agree with the authors' explanation that it \"might be due to underrepresentation of FVC data in the training sets, leading to potential bias, and also due to inherent complexities in real-life fingerprint data, which are harder to handle\", these challenges are faced by all learning-based fingerprint recognition approaches and solutions that don't perform well on real data will be less attractive.\n\n2. Perhaps this is a weakness for deep learning based fingerprint recognition systems, but given that there are many real-world fingerprint verification systems based on minutiae matching, there needs to be a stronger case made for how the proposed deep learning approach is expected to have an impact in the real world.\n\n3. It is not sufficiently explained what \"self supervision\" means in this paper. My understanding is that both degraded and enhanced fingerprints are used for training. Aren't the enhanced fingerprints akin to having ground truth and if so isn't that training supervised? Not enough details are provided to understand this correctly.\n\n4. The paper needs to provide more mathematical details of the proposed approach. For example, more details should be provided about the fingerprint enhancement procedure and results.\n\n5. It is not clear what attributes of fingerprints are being taken advantage of, in the proposed approach. Are fingerprint geometric structures or minutiae being used somehow in the training? Overall, this paper is lacking in technical details."

How is the enhancement quality evaluated?\n\n3. In Fig. 3, I assume that degraded images are on top and enhanced ones on the bottom  --- if this is correct, please state that in that figure caption.  It appears that the fingerprint degradation is artificial and not based on real-world challenges. If that is correct, could it be the reason for the poorer performance on FVC datasets?\n\n4. I am a little confused about how the accuracy numbers on the entire dataset are computed. In Table 2, it is stated that the accuracy of the proposed method on the entire data is 0.973. But if the impostor accuracy is 0.982 and the genuine accuracy is 0.886 and the data split is 1 genuine pair for every 3 impostor pairs, shouldn't the overall accuracy be (3*0.982 + 1*0.886)/4 = 0.958, not 0.973?"

We would like to address the reviewer's questions.\n- As we are using enhancement task for pre-training stage with larger dataset of degraded-enhanced image pairs and no identity labels, we are using indirect supervision for verification task. Hence, we are using less labeled samples for verification. We refer to self-supervision in this sense.\n- Enhancement task is denoising process where input is degraded image to U-Net and output is enhanced image. We evaluated the model using SSIM, RSME, PSNR metrics to check image quality. Moreover, we also checked NFIQ2 scores for few images (NFIQ2 is NIST tool that gives score to measure fingerprint image quality). We will update these results and add missing technical details in our paper. Thank you for pointing it out.\n- Yes, first row are degraded images and second row are enhanced counterparts. Sure, we would mention the same in the caption. The images in FVC dataset as the official website says, are collected from sensors by volunteers, hence artificial degradations are not added.\n- We apologize as there is a typo as it is supposed to be 1:10 genuine-imposter pairs. We will correct this in the paper. Thanks to the reviewer for highlighting this."

Thus, they can be used to develop highly accurate fingerprint recognition systems based on supervised learning and traditional pattern recognition methods. \n\nAlthough the experimental results show that the proposed method is better than other SSL methods, the accuracy is still very low comparing with other state-of-the-art fingerprint recognition systems.\n\nIn fact, fingerprint recognition for commercial applications is generally considered as a solved problem. The accuracy of the current fingerprint recognition systems is very high.\n\nThe novelty of the work is low, comparing with other ICRL paper I read and review.

Relying heavily on one dataset can lead to overfitting and reduced model robustness. Expanding the dataset variety would likely improve the model's generalizability.\n\nEvaluation Scope: The study did not specifically train or evaluate the fingerprint recognition task, which seems to be a core application of the proposed method. A more targeted evaluation on this task would provide clearer insights into the model's practical utility.\n\nLinear Probing Technique: The authors used a specific form of linear probing for their study. While they acknowledge the existence of alternative approaches, such as softmax or ArcFace-based classification, these were not explored. These alternative methods might offer better representation learning, and their omission is a missed opportunity.\n\nComparative Analysis: While the paper compares the proposed method against established techniques, it would be beneficial to see a deeper analysis of why their method outperforms others. Understanding the underlying reasons for performance differences can guide future improvements.\n\nSelf-supervised Learning Reliance: The efficacy of the proposed self-supervised learning methodologies is heavily reliant on the quality and diversity of the training data. This dependence can be a limitation if diverse and high-quality data is not available."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for providing detailed review for our work. We would like to address your questions.\n- Dataset selection: Many of the earlier available fingerprint datasets are revoked from public domain. Moreover, they are small and contain very less number of impressions per fingerprint, making us rely on synthetically generated fingerprints. Also, they don't possess enhanced/clean impressions for ground-truths in enhancement pre-training stage.\n- Model Generalization: The models are tested on two standard publicly available test sets NIST SD 302 and FVC datasets used in most of the literature works.\n- Evaluation Scope: We hypothesized that the improved performance on verification task would result in improved performance for recognition task because matching is the crux between both the tasks. Verification task is 1:1 matching whereas Recognition is 1:N matching. Hence, we haven't shown recognition results.\n- Linear Probing Technique: We wanted to test the performance of the learnt representations in comparision with other SOTA self-supervised techniques which normally use projection head on top of encoder. Hence, we employed similar technique for our enhancement-based approach.\n- Model Comparison: As the model was pretrained on enhancement task, it learned the specific details of fingerprints like ridge/valley structures with noise removal, while other methods performance heavily depend on data augmentations and were mostly designed to work for real world natural images.\n- Self-supervised Learning: We employed simpler and intuitive technique in self-supervised paradigm for our approach and yet see considerable performance improvement. Hence, we believe more advanced techniques can improve the results further.\n- Future Work: We haven't performed preliminary experiments as such but we think that keeping encoder unfrozen with very small learning rate can help model perform well on verification dataset which would make sense only when dataset is big enough for model generalizability and avoid overfitting (we possess smaller labeled dataset for second stage training (verification task)).  \n- Model Robustness: We evaluated our model on real world fingerprint datasets FVC which contain degraded and noisy fingerprint data. We think that the performance trend should be similar on other real world datasets too, in any. \n- Implementation Details: All algorithm specific hyperparameters for other self-supervised techniques were according to the algorithm papers. LR was set as 1e-3 with batch size of 64 for our approach and U-Net architecture was used as base network."
