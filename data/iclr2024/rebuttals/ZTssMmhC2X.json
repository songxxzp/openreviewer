There isn't enough data to back this claim. \n  - Minor: It also says that all models except CLIP were trained on ImageNet-21K, whereas DINO is trained on ImageNet-1k.\n- The CIFAR-10 results on CLIP are presented in a misleading manner \"SGD (freeze-embed) gets 20% and 30% lower error than SGD on CLIP ViT-B/16 and ViT-L/14, respectively.\" where the difference across SGD, AdamW and SGD (freeze-embed) is only <=0.4%\n- The paper does a grid search on a single hyperparameter, learning rate, and sweeps over 6 values, but holds the weight decay constant at 0 for SGD and 0.01 for AdamW. Models pretrained differently (SSL, CLIP, supervised) usually require very different finetuning settings, so this search is a bit limited, but this isn't a major weakness since the primary point is showing that SGD (freeze-embed) catches up to AdamW without recipe changes to SGD.\n- Minor: The paper claims contradictory numbers for SGD and AdamW memory consumption (12 bytes vs 16 bytes per parameter in the Abstract, and AdamW maintaining 2x to 3x more states as SGD in the Introduction)."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough review and the positive comments. We address the reviewer's questions and concerns. \n\n> While the paper's focus is distribution shift evaluations, it doesn't touch upon conventional downstream evaluation tasks such as ImageNet-1k, iNaturalist, datasets in VTAB\n1. We present results for **CIFAR-10** in Table 6. \n2. We do not test on ImageNet because some of the models are pretrained using supervised labels on ImageNet.\n3. We picked distribution shift datasets because we wanted to examine the accuracy **both in-distribution and out-of-distribution** (a critical problem in modern deep learning). We note that the datasets we use are **popular evaluation benchmarks**: as one metric, DomainNet has 1300 cites, WILDS has 900 cites, Waterbirds has 1100 cites, which is comparable to iNaturalist and VTAB. For some recent examples of transfer learning papers that focus on these datasets, see Kumar et al. 2022, Goyal et al., 2022, Ghosal et al., 2022, Wortsman et al. 2022. We also examine real world datasets in satellite data (FMoW) and tumor detection (Camelyon). \n\nThat said, we agree that testing on more datasets will solidify our claims and will add this to the future work section.\n\n> It is not clear\u2026 when researchers should use SGD (freeze-embed) as compared to SGD and AdamW\n1. **SGD-freeze embed works consistently well**, so we recommend using it as a general guideline. SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 80% of the 70 settings. In table 1 (out-of-distribution), we show 35 model-dataset pairs (7 models, and 5 datasets). SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 27/35 of the comparisons. In table 2 (in-distribution), SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 29/35 comparisons.\n2. In modern deep learning it's rarely the case that a single optimizer dominates in every case\u2014our paper gives a detailed analysis as to when and why each of the optimizers can do better. To get further improvements, practitioners can look at the **embedding layer gradients** at the start of training (which is very cheap). If these are similar to (or smaller than) the gradients of other layers, then we expect SGD (even without freeze embed) to work fairly well.\n3. In addition, our experiments and analysis in Appendix E show that SGD works better when the model was pretrained with SGD, or when the fine-tuning data is similar to pretraining (e.g., Living-17, which is a subset of ImageNet). So researchers and practitioners can also use their understanding of the pretraining optimization process, and the relationship between the pretraining and fine-tuning data, to get further improvements.\n\n> It is not clear\u2026 in which situations the high grad norms for the embedding layer happen\n\nWe examine this question in detail in Appendix E. High grad norms for the embedding layer happen when the model is pretrained with AdamW. Rough intuition: AdamW normalizes the gradient by the variance\u2014so there is \"no incentive\" to equalize the gradient norms across different layers."

We calculated **error reduction** as (99.3% - 99.0%) / (100% - 99.0%) = **30%**. The reason we examine the error reduction is that **at such high accuracy levels**, it is much more **difficult to improve the accuracy**. For example, it is often not too hard to improve the accuracy from 80.0% to 82.0% (a 2% improvement), but improving the accuracy from 99.0% to 101% is impossible. In other words the 0.3% accuracy improvement should be contextualized with the maximum possible accuracy improvement of 1.0%. However, we acknowledge your point and have **edited to note the exact accuracy** in the text. Happy to make additional changes as you like.\n\n> In Section 4 it is mentioned \"SGD performs well when fine-tuning data is closer to pretraining.\" and the conclusion is drawn from just a single data point, CLIP\n\nJust to clarify\u2014our claim in Section 4 is not based on CLIP. We examined all the models pretrained on ImageNet (multiple models), and compared their performance across multiple datasets. We noticed that SGD performs well on the dataset that is most similar to ImageNet (Living-17, which is a subset of ImageNet). We agree that more evidence would be good\u2014we have softened the phrasing to \"This suggests that SGD **may** work better when fine-tuning and pretraining data are similar\u2014we leave a more thorough analysis to future work\". Happy to make more changes\u2014how does that sound?\n\n> Minor: It also says that all models except CLIP were trained on ImageNet-21K, whereas DINO is trained on ImageNet-1k.\n\nGreat catch, we have fixed this.\n\n> \"contradictory numbers for SGD and AdamW memory consumption (12 bytes vs 16 bytes per parameter in the Abstract, and AdamW maintaining 2x to 3x more states as SGD in the Introduction).\"\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We agree and apologize for the mistake. To clarify:\n1. SGD (no momentum) stores 2 floats per parameter\n2. SGD (with momentum) stores 3 floats per parameter\n3.

While SGD and AdamW are both widely used, SGD is favored for its memory efficiency when they perform equally well. However, the authors reveal that especially in scenarios with *distribution shifts*, AdamW excels in fine-tuning modern Vision Transformer and ConvNeXt models.\n\nThe key observation is that this performance gap between SGD and AdamW is most pronounced when the gradients in the first \"embedding\" layer are significantly larger than those in the rest of the model. To address this issue, the authors propose a simple solution: freezing the embedding layer, which accounts for less than 1% of the parameters. This approach not only matches AdamW's performance but also conserves memory, with up to a 33% reduction in GPU usage on ViT-L.\n\nThe proposed approach leads to SOTA results on five popular distribution shift benchmarks, such as WILDS-FMoW, WILDS-Camelyon, BREEDS-Living-17, Waterbirds, and DomainNet. In essence, this paper offers an enchanting recipe to narrow the performance gap between SGD with momentum and AdamW. Their findings shed light on optimizing large vision models."

We address the reviewer's questions below.\n\n> the improvement of the proposed approach, compared to the vanilla approach is marginal\n\nWe note that the improvements of SGD (freeze embed) are quite significant:\n- Comparison to SGD: SGD (freeze-embed) achieves **5% higher accuracy OOD**, averaged across all datasets and models, and also performs better on the vast majority of datasets.\n- Comparison to AdamW: SGD (freeze-embed) uses substantially less memory. For example, **AdamW consumes 50% more memory** than SGD (freeze-embed, no momentum) on a ViT-L---on top of the significant memory savings, SGD (freeze-embed, no momentum) still achieves higher OOD accuracy.\n\n> how does the developer or engineer decide which approach to use when it comes to different datasets?\n\n1. **SGD-freeze embed works consistently well**, so we recommend using it as a general guideline. SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 80% of the 70 settings (7 models $\\times$ 5 datasets $\\times$ {ID, OOD}).  In table 1 (out-of-distribution), we show 35 model-dataset pairs (7 models, and 5 datasets). SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 27/35 of the comparisons. In table 2 (in-distribution), SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 29/35 comparisons. \n2. In modern deep learning it's rarely the case that a single optimizer dominates in every case\u2014our paper gives a detailed analysis as to when and why each of the optimizers can do better. To get further improvements, practitioners can look at the **embedding layer gradients** at the start of training (which is very cheap---a single backward pass). If these are similar to (or smaller than) the gradients of other layers, then we expect SGD (even without freeze embed) to work fairly well.\n3. In addition, our experiments and analysis in Appendix E show that SGD works better when the model was pretrained with SGD, or when the fine-tuning data is similar to pretraining (e.g., Living-17, which is a subset of ImageNet). So researchers and practitioners can also use their understanding of the pretraining optimization process, and the relationship between the pretraining and fine-tuning data, to get further improvements.\n\n> Reprogramming [1, 2] and Visual Prompting [3, 4, 5]... please discuss these methods in the related work.\n\nThank you for the useful pointers\u2014we have **added these to the related works**.\n\n> Please report the mean and standard deviation of the results across multiple rounds (different seeds).\n\nWe **reported mean and std-dev for CLIP** (the most advanced of the models we consider for distribution shift) across multiple seeds in Table 5. \nRunning multiple seeds for all of table 2 was too expensive\u2014we already did a sweep over 4 optimizers x 5 datasets x 7 models x 6 learning rates (and also other optimizers such as LARS and LAMB, ablations on weight decay, etc)\u2014multiplying all results by multiple seeds was computationally infeasible. However, we hope that the multiple seeds for CLIP, and breadth of results across datasets and models, is helpful. If there are any specific results you are particularly interested in, we can run additional seeds for them!"

The main observation of the paper is that when fine-tuning on out of distribution data the gradient magnitudes on the first embedding layer for architectures pre-trained with AdamW and fine-tuned with SGD are large. The authors hypothesize that the large gradients result in overfitting on OOD data. To address the paper freezes the embedding layer when fine-tuning with SGD and shows that the models can be fine-tuned as well as or better than using AdamW with lower memory footprint. The experimental evaluation and the results validate the hypothesis and the effectiveness of the proposed freeze SGD fine-tuning method."

We wanted to be thorough and prioritize covering different types of datasets, distributions shifts, and models for this work, but examining segmentation and detection is a good idea for future work. We note that follow-up work has shown that SGD (freeze-embed) works well for NLP models such as RoBERTa\u2014so it is more general than image classification.\n\n> Gradual unfreezing is mentioned in Table 5 but the method is not clearly described in the paper.\n\nWe apologize for the confusion. Gradual unfreezing is another ablation we tried\u2014it is not a main contender in the paper, but we give results in Appendix B. The idea is to unfreeze layers from top to bottom over the course of training. We have added a description to Appendix B.\n\n> Given an optimizer mismatch can the overfitting of early layers be avoided by low learning rates in the early part of fine-tuning?\n\nThis is an interesting idea! We note that learning rate warmup is generally helpful for AdamW (because it leads to better estimates for the moments), and generally has a smaller benefit for SGD. Also, we did sweep over many learning rates including some very small learning rates and selected the best, which hopefully partially accounts for this. In this work we focused our additional experiments on different optimizers (e.g., AdamW, LARS, LAMB), lower learning rates on the embedding layer, linear probing, SGD with weight decay, etc.\n\nWe agree that the learning rate schedule is good to explore in future work, and have mentioned this in the revised submission."

We address the remaining questions:\n\n> Will such modified SGD still achieve performance gain on NLP model such as Llama2?\n\nWe note that follow-up work has shown that SGD (freeze-embed) **works well for NLP models** such as RoBERTa. We think examining whether it helps Llama2 is a great avenue for future work\u2014based on our results in Appendix E we believe this is potentially promising because Llama2 was pretrained using AdamW, and that is when our method tends to outperform SGD.\n\n> As you mentioned, the reason why the early embedding layer has larger gradients is that such models are typically pre-trained by Adam. What will the result be if they are models are pre-trained by SGD? Will it be worse than with Adam?\n\nIn Appendix E, we run controlled experiments where we pretrain a ResNet-50 model with (a) SGD, or (b) AdamW. We then fine-tune each of these models with (1) SGD, (2) AdamW, and (3) SGD Freeze-Embed. We find that **when the model is pretrained with SGD, then it is better to fine-tune with SGD than with AdamW.**"

It turns out that the embedding layer gradients are quite large and AdamW is able to suppress the huge swings in embedding layer values caused by these gradients. A simple method is proposed whereby the embedding layer is frozen during finetuning. This method is shown to perform on par or better than AdamW in both in-distribution and out of distribution finetuning. Moreover, SGD with frozen embedding layer uses less memory than AdamW (roughly 1.3x less)."

In such cases, it is also unclear whether this kind of method could work. Of course, the authors are explicit that this paper is about vision models in particular, so I am not penalizing them for this (possible) shortcoming\n3) In some cases, SGD performed as well or better than the other variants. From the practitioners point of view, how should one choose which method to use?"

We respond to their questions below.\n\n> From the practitioners point of view, how should one choose which method to use?\n\n1. **SGD-freeze embed works consistently well**, so we recommend using it as a general guideline. SGD freeze-embed does better than SGD in 80% of the 70 settings (7 models $\\times$ 5 datasets $\\times$ {ID, OOD}).\n2. In modern deep learning it's rarely the case that a single optimizer dominates in every case\u2014our paper gives a detailed analysis as to when and why each of the optimizers can do better. To get further improvements, practitioners can look at the **embedding layer gradients** at the start of training (which is computationally very cheap---a single backward pass). If these are similar to (or smaller than) the gradients of other layers, then we expect SGD (even without freeze embed) to work fairly well.\n3. In addition, our experiments and analysis in Appendix E show that SGD works better when the model was pretrained with SGD, or when the fine-tuning data is similar to pretraining (e.g., Living-17, which is a subset of ImageNet). So researchers and practitioners can also use their understanding of the pretraining optimization process, and the relationship between the pretraining and fine-tuning data, to get further improvements.\n\n> Why does the memory overhead of adamw relative to sgd increase with model size?\n\nThis is because there is **memory** taken up by **activations (same for all optimizers)**, and by **parameters and optimizer state** (which depends on the optimizer).\n- Memory of AdamW = Activation memory + 4 $\\times$ parameter memory\n- Memory of SGD (no momentum) = Activation memory + 2 $\\times$ parameter memory\n\nFor **larger ViT models, parameter memory dominates activation memory**, and so the overhead of AdamW increases (up to a maximum of 2x).\n\n> hinges on models which have an embedding layer\n> recommendation models\u2026 embedding layer contains most of the model parameters\n\nSome recent follow-ups to our paper have found that freezing the embedding layer can lead to improvements in NLP models such as RoBERTa. \n\nConceptually, we can think of the embedding layer as an abstract interface between the raw input and the later networks in the model, in which case our kind of analysis may be useful for a more general class of models.\n\nRecommender systems is another interesting domain\u2014we have noted this and the cite in the future work section.\n\n\n> For Fig. 2, are the gradient norms normalized by number of elements?\n\nFigure 2 does not normalize by number of elements, however in Appendix F we show figures where they are normalized by the parameter norm, and the number of parameters.\n\n> Why do you think SGD outperforms the other alternatives across so many experiments?\n\nCould we please clarify which alternative you are referring to here? SGD (freeze-embed) and AdamW generally perform better than SGD in the majority of experiments"
