The following method is highly similar with CSI, an existing method. To offer a clearer perspective, the authors should provide a detailed comparison with CSI, highlighting the key distinctions between these two approaches. Does the contribution come from the proposed augmentation?\n2.\tThe concept presented in this paper has been explored extensively in the literature. Many previous works have investigated the use of fine-grained or natural synthetic anomalies as alternatives to basic augmentations to enhance performance. For instance, in [a], the method incorporates Poisson image editing to seamlessly blend scaled patches of various sizes from separate images. It would be valuable to investigate how such Poisson image editing performs within the CSI framework and whether the proposed diffusion model-based augmentation outperforms these methods when applied within the same CSI framework.\n3.\tThis paper seems to be incomplete or abbreviated. For instance, in Figure 4 on Page 8, two non-medical datasets, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, are employed, yet these datasets are not introduced or explained elsewhere in the paper. Additionally, the results are not compared with any baseline methods, such as CSI. \n\n[a] Schluter et al. \"Natural Synthetic Anomalies for Self-Supervised Anomaly Detection and Localization.\" ECCV 2022."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you for your review and feedback. We would like to provide the following comments:\n\nW1. Incremental Contribution Over CSI:\n   To clarify, we indeed included a detailed comparison with CSI in Section 3.2.2 and Figure 3. This comparison highlights how our novel dissolving transformation branch enhances the contrastive learning framework beyond what is achieved by CSI alone. Additionally, the novelty in this work is primarily a novel use of diffusion models, and we are using the CSI framework to demonstrate the effective usage of our novel components.\n\nW2. Comparison with Other Fine-Grained Data Augmentation Methods:\nWe thank the reviewers for the interesting suggestion. We can include this experiment in the supplementary material if the paper is accepted. However, the suggested comparison is not very close to the contribution of the paper. There are countless other highly sophisticated data augmentation methods that one can compare to. In addition, the suggested Poisson image editing method does not conflict with our idea. It can be an additional image augmentation method to include, in which our algorithm already uses a library of data augmentation methods. The use of our approach is complementary to the use of traditional augmentations. \n\nW3. Clarification on Non-Medical Datasets Usage:\n   We apologize for any confusion caused by the inclusion of the description of non-medical datasets in the main paper. We initially included the comparison in the main paper, but we moved those experiments into our supplementary materials due to space constraints. We will exclude them from the main paper in the revised version.\n\nWe hope that these responses adequately address your queries and thank you for your valuable input."

How does this cost compare to previous methods in the field?

If so, what performance difference would be observed if a general pre-trained diffusion model were utilized?\n\n(5) In the realm of visual anomaly detection, prior works have showcased the effectiveness of methods like PatchCore.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nWe believe there may be a fundamental  misunderstanding of our work that we hope to discuss further.  We are using diffusion models for \u201cdenoising\u201d rather than injecting noise Further, we are not performing traditional denoising that the diffusion model was trained on. We observe that in our setting, we can get the diffusion model to remove instance-specific features rather than Gaussian noise that the diffusion model was trained on.\n\nW1. We therefore would interpret the reviewer\u2019s suggestion on \u201crandom noise injection\u201d to \u201cnaive blurring methods\u201d. We provided the corresponding experiments in our supplementary material of different blurring methods, and our diffusion approach achieved much better results.\n\nW2. We think this is an intuitive idea to work with. Our proposed methods consists of two parts of feature dissovling and feature amplifying. For feature dissolving, since diffusion models are using a denoising UNet, we are essentially taking the individual denoising UNet as the denoiser to remove instance-specific features. Then, we employ a contrastive learning method to compare the image with instance features against the original one to emphasize those removed features. For medical anomaly detection tasks that require the understanding of the instance-specific features, our method can work well. We will add more descriptions in Section 3 to emphasize this idea. \n\nW3. We apologize for the missing results for the number of steps, and we will include it  in Section 5.1. The final results indicate our choices of the number of steps as described in Section 4.2. The contrastive learning framework is taken from the CSI paper and we wish to focus on our contributions, so that we chose not to add the experiments for those two loss terms.\n\nW4. We included the computational cost in Section 5.3. It is an interesting question about using off-the-shelf models. We do not use those models since generic models are not aware of the particular structure of medical data. Say, generic models without training would dissolve images to the common characteristics of the training images, in order to generate various types of images, while the particular trained medical diffusion models can well understand the particular structure of medical data. Additionally, the computational cost for high resolution dissolving transformations is much higher. According to Table 4, dissovling with a 128x128 UNet is 5 times (about 70 hours) slower than 32x32 (about 14 hours), a higher resolution model training can take weeks to finish. It is therefore not applicable enough. We will include a discussion along with visual demonstrations around this.\n\nW5. We thank the reviewers for the suggestions. Though PatchCore uses a totally different approach by building a training memory bank rather than contrastive learning and image synthesis, we think it is reasonable to include this method. Since the anomaly detection area envolves rapidly, we may add the results for PatchCore if the paper is accepted since we would like to prioritize the experiments of dissolving transformations.\n\nW6. We thank the reviewers for the suggestions. Unfortunately, our current setting does not support generating accurate localization results."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nWe appreciate your insightful comments and the recognition of our novel approach. Below, we comment on the concerns:\n\nW1. Theoretical Basis for Dissolving Transformation:\n   The reverse diffusion step is essentially a trained denoiser using UNet. We found the denoising ability of the diffusion-trained UNet can remove the instance-specific features, and revert back a given image to its input distribution, as Reviewer 1 indicated. We therefore took the advantage of its denoising power. We will include more intuitive descriptions in our work.\n\nW2. Suitability for Medical Images:\n   Different from other data domains, medical image normally consists of a consistent background, then more detailed features will be added. For example, chest X-ray images have the same black background and the same shape of the chest, then more instance-specific additive features will be added such as bones, tumors, etc. In terms of the feature-wise dissolving, image data is therefore the most suitable as one can remove the most instance-specific features first until the most generic features. A mathematical perspective as mentioned by Reviewer 1 is that this reverse diffusion process can pull back a given image to its input distribution. We will include a detailed explanation of why our method is particularly well-suited for medical images in the introduction.\n\nW3. Comparison with Medical Image-Focused Methods:\n   We acknowledge the importance of relevant comparisons. We considered additional methods for a comparison, but there were three main reasons why a particular method could not be considered: 1) Most medical anomaly works are not open-source. 2) Several medical anomaly detection works try to address a different problem (e.g. supervised). 3) Some comparisons are abandoned since we could not reproduce the results by their open-source code. We will consider adding more comparison if the reviewer could point out specific methods to compare to.\n\nW4. Resolution Downscaling Query:\n   The variations in performance across different resolutions are attributed to two main factors. Firstly, the size of training samples impacts this. In larger datasets such as APTOS and Retinal-OCT, the performance degradation is less pronounced. This is likely because higher resolution diffusion models are not well-trained, resulting in a more noticeable performance drop. Secondly, the nature of critical features plays a role. High-resolution images naturally contain more details. In datasets like APTOS, where disease indicators are subtler in pixel space (e.g., hemorrhages or thinner blood vessels), the performance drop is minimal. In fact, 64x64 resolution images may even outperform 32x32 ones. Conversely, in datasets like Retinal-OCT, where crucial features are more prominent in pixel space (like edemas), lower resolution images help the model concentrate on these more apparent features. Our results indicate that a resolution of 32x32 yields the  optimal performance for dissolving transformations. We thank the reviewer for the in-depth question, and we will add more results interpretation in the corresponding section.\n\nW5. Diffusion Step Variation:\n   We apologize for the missing results for the number of steps, and we will include it in Section 5.1. The final results indicate our choices of the number of steps as described in Section 4.2.\n\nWe hope these responses adequately address your queries and concerns. Thank you for your valuable feedback."

The idea of taking the input images for further reverse diffusions is a bit surpring at first sight but it is reasonable if we assume diffusion models pull reversed samples towards the distributions of input data."

                    "value": "A very critical sanity check is needed to validate the dissolving transforms: Would simple gaussian smoothings and/or additive noises on the image space or shallow-layer feature space lead to similar \u201cdissolving\u201d effect as with diffusion models? The general idea is still to remove fine-grained subtleness by smoothing or altering the content. But if simple gaussian smoothing/additive noises can reach similar effects, there would be no need to bother training a diffusion model. This is the major reason I remain slightly negative at this stage. \n\n\nSome terms are not self-explanative: E.g., what does diffusion models to be \u201cfeature-aware\u201d mean in the abstract? \n\n\nThe term *positive synthesis* and *negative synthesis* may not be sufficiently representative: the authors may consider using the terms *reconstructive approaches* or *generative approaches* to summarize DAE-/AnnoGAN-/Diffusion-based models, etc. and using *discriminative approaches* to summarize synthetic-anomoly-based approaches. Also, the authors may want to discuss approaches that synthesize anomalies based on handcrafted assumptions on anomaly distributions: [1,2]. Performance comparisons with those methods are also welcomed, if the authors find them necessary. \n\nThe dissolving operation serves as the core of the approach while intuitively it subjects to the selection and training details of the base diffusion models. Therefore, more details of the diffusion model (e.g., subtypes of diffusion models, number of steps, computational overhead, etc.) and how they dictate the final anomaly detection results need to be discussed. \n\nEq. 10 lacks clarity: Do we compute the mean scores under all $k$\u2019s or do we take the max? For $S_{con}$, why does the feature norm need to be multiplied?"

We address the raised questions below:\n\nW1: Sanity Check of Dissolving Transforms:\nWe acknowledge the importance of comparing  the dissolving transforms against simpler methods like Gaussian smoothing or additive noise. To address this, we conducted additional experiments (see Supplementary Material, Section A.2). The results show that while Gaussian/Median blur smoothing can mimic a 'dissolving' effect, they lack the nuanced, fine-grained feature alteration achieved by our diffusion model-based approach. The diffusion model subtly alters features in a semantically meaningful way that significantly improves anomaly detection performance.\n\nW2. Clarification of Terminology:\nWe apologize for any confusion caused by the term \"feature-aware\" in the abstract. We have amended the text for clarity. This term refers to the ability of diffusion models to recognize features in an image through the learning process and perform a feature dependent manipulation. This is the opposite of \u201cfeature-agnostic\u201d, e.g. as would be done by blurring operations.\n\nW3. Synthesis Terms and Comparative Analysis:\nYour suggestion to use terms like 'reconstructive' and 'discriminative' approaches is well-taken. We have revised our terminology for clarity and consistency. Regarding the comparison with handcrafted anomaly synthesis methods, we would kindly ask if the reviewer can provide the corresponding references again since the references [1,2] are missing.\n\nW4. Details on Diffusion Models:\nWe provided details on the diffusion models used in Supplementary Material, and computational overhead in Section 5.3. Additionally, we will provide  the missing ablation results in Section 5.1.\n\nW5. Equation 10 Clarification:\nWe apologize for any confusion caused by Equation 10. This score function consists of cosine similarity and the norm of the feature. We did not mention the normalization term for $s_cls$ in our equation. We have now clarified that the mean scores are computed under all k and explained the multiplication of the feature norm in greater detail in Section 3.3.\n\nW6. Additional Discussion on Diffusion Models and Computational Costs:\n   We thank the reviewer for suggestions. The computational costs are provided in section 5.3. We will include more details about the diffusion model we used in our supplementary material.\n\nW7. Table 4 Details:\n   We thank the reviewer for suggestions. We mentioned the data numbers in our supplementary material. The exact number for PneumoniaMNIST is 5856 and Kvasir-Polyp is 8000.  We have now included the absolute number of training samples in Table 4 for better clarity and understanding of the experimental setup.\n\nWe believe these amendments and additional analyses address your concerns and further strengthen our paper.
