                    "value": "The author proposed a rule-based image segmentation algorithm for 2D CT images with lymphatic malformation lesions. Three measurements are designed for distinguishing the lesion regions from the background, i.e., fuzzy degree, pixel deepness, and boundary smoothness. The lesion region is segmented by performing an iterative region shrinkage-based approach with repeated measurements of regions. 12 CT images are adopted for the experiments, and no comparison results are reported with other methods. The presented work is overall preliminary and not ready for publication."

How will the proposed method work on non-round targets?\n- The motivation for introducing the three measurements is not clearly introduced. What's the meaning of these three measurements?\n- Is the method 2D or 3D? CTs are 3D;  how the extra dimension is handled, and what will be the benefit of considering them in 3D?\n- The experimental dataset is too small, i.e., 12 CT images. It is hard to appreciate the advantages of adopting the proposed method. \n- Previous segmentation methods are not compared in the experiments.\n- The presentation of the work is not sound, e.g., figures are blurring(Figure 1), equations are not numbered, functions are used before defined (f in Definition 1), quantitative results are missing, etc."
