There are two conflicting goals here: conserve image content after decompression, and be good in machine perception tasks. However, there is issues with both\nA) The main text only reports LPIPS differences, and there are no PSNR numbers. From the visual examples we see that the method quite significantly alters the input image (eg Fig 4b).\nB) From Fig 5 and 6 I'm seeing large drops in performance as we go down in bpp. It is unclear to me which tasks are fine with eg ~14% drops in accuracy (Fig 6, top red line). \n\nWhat's concerning is that the preprocessing module is a deep neural network, that has to run on the sender. So, if machine perception is the goal, why not run the resnet on the sender, and encode the label? Eg classification with 1024 labels is only 10 bits! \n\nWhile the proxy network is a cool way to approximate BPG, I just don't see the overall value proposition for an ICLR paper."
