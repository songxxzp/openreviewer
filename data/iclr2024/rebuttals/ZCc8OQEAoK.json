The authors introduce local and global attention, which is somewhat similar to GAT, to address the issues of feature over-smoothing and fixed weight propagation in non-parametric GNNs. Experiments on eleven datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed NPA compared with baselines."

The global attention is somewhat similar to GNNs with residuals, e.g., S2GC, APPNP, JKNet, etc. Although the designed local and global attention is not trainable (which is different from GAT), it is hard to regard the utilization of attention as a prominent contribution. The contributions may be not enough for ICLR. \n- NPA fails to promote the non-linearity capacity of SGC/S2GC, which may be the primary limitation compared with vanilla GNNs. NPA just focuses on how to improve the graph propagation of non-parametric GNNs. \n- As pointed out above, the achieved improvements, which are compared with non-parametric GNNs, are slight in most cases. It may be caused by the only improvement of graph propagation."

To tackle the problem of fixed weights, the author introduces a technique called local attention, which assesses the similarity between node features. This method computes node-level similarity, and it is orthogonal to other pre-computing approaches.\n\n2. To combat the over-smoothing problem, the author proposes the use of a residual connection, where the weights are also determined using similarity (global attention). The overall experiments conducted to validate these methods are presented and provide valuable insights."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1.\tOverall, the novelty of this work is not strong. Given that fixed weight and over-smoothing problems have been extensively studied in the literature, there is no clear evidence of why and how the proposed local and global attention advances the state-of-the-art.\n\n(1) Local attention: In the appendix, the authors assert that NPA directly quantifies the similarity between two propagated node features, setting it apart from GAT and the local attention mechanism can be pre-computed during feature pre-processing, which enhances scalability. However, it's still similar to the mechanisms in SAGN and GAMLP, as both of these models also involve precomputing attention based on propagated features. Combining the proposed method with those existing models might lead to only marginal improvements, as can be seen in the comparison between GAMLP and GAMLP+NPA in Table 2. It raises questions about the novelty of this technique. \n\n\n(2) Global attention: The global attention mechanism appears to be primarily a residual connection with the previous aggregation step. The novelty lies in how the coefficients are computed using cosine similarity instead of being set manually. The novelty is limited. Besides, I also would suggest that the author should add an ablation study about how this approach addresses the over-smoothing issue in comparison to simpler techniques like APPNP and DAGNN (Towards Deeper Graph Neural Networks, KDD 2020).\n\n2.\tThe Baselines are mostly weak in handling over-smoothing issues. Improvements over existing solutions need to be better justified.\n\n(1) The experimental results indicate that SIGN+NPA performs worse than SAGN on two widely used large-scale datasets, ogbn-products, and ogbn-papers100M, where SAGN is a widely cited method whose technique is quite similar to this paper. In light of this, it is recommended that the author considers introducing more strong baselines and conducting additional experiments, such as SAGN/SAGN+NPA, to ascertain whether local attention indeed provides substantial benefits.\n\n(2) Some of the baseline results might not be accurate. For instance, SIGN achieves an 80.5% score on the ogb-leaderboard, which is notably higher than the reported figures (76.83%) in the paper and considerably surpasses SIGN+NPA. It raises the question of whether the author employed fair experimental settings across these models.\n\n3. Empirically, the improvements over weak baselines are pretty marginal (refer to Table 1 and Table 2) while the computation cost is higher. Moreover, there is no theoretical analysis to justify the advantages of the proposed method over existing ones.\n\n4. The name \"Non-parametric GNNs\" in the title and paper is quite misleading. It essentially means the decoupled propagation similar to SGC, SIGN, and APPNP. It would be better to be adjusted to avoid confusion with terminologies in non-parametric statistics."
