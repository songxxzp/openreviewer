                    "value": "The paper addresses the challenging task of reasoning on knowledge graphs using neural link predictors. The prevailing method in this field is query embedding, which treats logic operations as set operations and has shown empirical success. However, the paper argues that many claims made in previous research lack a formal and systematic inspection. To address this, the authors characterize the scope of previously investigated queries, identify the gap between the formulation and the goal, and provide complexity analysis for the queries. They also introduce a new dataset with ten new types of queries and propose a new neural-symbolic method called Fuzzy Inference with Truth value (FIT) that combines neural link predictors with fuzzy logic theory. The empirical results demonstrate that FIT outperforms previous methods significantly in the new dataset and also surpasses previous methods in the existing dataset."

                    "value": "1. The paper shows many different opinions against previous series of works. The discussion firmly supports that TF query family is not even a subset of EFO1. In addition, the paper rethinks the traditional claim that \u201creasoning involves an exponential growth in computational time\u201d. The proposition and analysis finally found that the Tree-Form EFO1 reasoning complexity is linear to the number of variables in the query.\n2. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the prevailing method of query embedding and its limitations. It identifies the gap between the formulation and the goal, which adds clarity to the field and helps in understanding the limitations of existing approaches.\n3. The introduction of a new dataset with ten new types of queries is a significant contribution. This dataset allows for a thorough investigation of complex queries and provides a benchmark for evaluating future methods.\n4. The proposed method, FIT, which combines neural link predictors with fuzzy logic theory, is a novel approach. It addresses the limitations of previous methods and demonstrates improved performance in both the new and existing datasets.\n5. The paper presents empirical results that support the superiority of FIT over previous methods. The significant improvement in performance in both datasets strengthens the credibility of the proposed method."

Thus they propose to pull the complex query answering research back to answering EFO_1 queries with rigorous formulations, and propose a method with neural link predictor based on fuzzy logic theory, called FIT. FIT outperforms baselines significantly in the new EFO_1 query dataset and also surpasses baselines in the existing dataset at the same time."

This general idea is also introduced in FuzzQE[1]. But the key difference between FIT and FuzzQE is not clearly discussed and FuzzQE is not compared in Table 2.\n\n\nWe thank you for mentioning FuzzQE. FuzzQE is surely an interesting paper that leverages fuzzy logic theory to build its model and we are aware of its contribution and have already cited this paper in our paper. However, as we have already stated in the whole Section 3 and Section 4, the previous method, including FuzzQE, only can represent Tree-Form query, and is therefore fundamentally different from our proposed FIT which can represent any EFO1 query. Therefore, FuzzQE is actually similar to other query embedding methods, like ConE[2] and BetaE[1], and we note the performance of FuzzQE is also similar to ConE[2] as reported in their paper, therefore, we do not compare FIT with FuzzQE in detail. Regarding your question about Table 2, all baseline methods we discuss here share the same pretrained KGE checkpoints, while FuzzQE does not. Therefore, we do not include FuzzQE in the Table 2 as it is not suitable for our discussion.\n\nWe will consider including it as a baseline in Table 1 instead in the camera-ready version.\n\n\n[1]Ren, Hongyu, and Jure Leskovec. \"Beta embeddings for multi-hop logical reasoning in knowledge graphs.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 19716-19726.\n\n[2]Zhang, Zhanqiu, et al. \"Cone: Cone embeddings for multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 19172-19183.\n\n\n\n> Should the formula be exchanged in Equation (3)? \n\n\nSorry for this typo, we have changed it based on your advice.\n\n\n> What is main difference between FuzzQE and FIT?\n\nPlease check our rebuttal of the first question."

[1] explicitly limit their definition of tree-form queries to only consider the negation of individual atomic formulae.\n\nWe thank you for stating your concerns directly. It is true that [1] has claimed to consider negation of atomic formula, and avoid universal quantifier in their preliminary. However, below the Definition 8, we have stated that the query types they actually investigated (Tree-Form)  deviate from their original goal (EFO1). Specifically, we state that the definition of Tree-form query is from direct derivation of the query embedding methods utilized in [1], we also include this part of the proof in Appendix B. We welcome you to check that. Moreover, we also welcome you to check the \u201cpni\u2019\u2019 data explained in our Example 10, which is available in the dataset provided by [1]. We note that we have again considered the new ``pni\u2019\u2019 data in our new dataset, because it is treated as the universal version in [1] but as the existential version in our paper. To summarize, we are actually inheriting the claim of [1] to infer any EFO1 query, and at the same time discussing what is wrong or missing in the previous pratice.\n\n[1] Hongyu Ren and Jure Leskovec.

We have included the conclusion that FIT is an extension of QTO in the main paper now according to your advice and then point to the appendix for the detailed proof. We are sorry that the space of the paper is restricted for more detail and we will try our best to put every conclusion in the main paper while leaving details and proofs in the appendix. \n\n> (Important) Definition 6: Missing definition of EFO1 query family\n\nSorry for this typo, Definition 6 should only be the answer set of the EFO1 query, as the EFO1 query has already been defined before Definition 4. We have corrected this typo according to your advice.\n\n> Eq 4: It would be good to have an intuitive definition of k here\n\nWe thank you for this suggestion, we have restated that k is a coefficient to characterize the sparsity of the knowledge graph.\n\n> Overall, the paper pushes a lot of context to the Appendix.

This was not considered in the paper.\n\nWe thank you for your advice on the baselines. In fact, LMPNN[1], one of our baselines, has the title of ``Logical Message Passing Networks with One-hop Inference on Atomic Formulas\u2019\u2019, and is a method that is based on message passing and updates the embedding of each node in the query graph in each interaction. We think this may help with your question.\n\nRegarding your problem:\n\n> The overall performance in mean reciprocal rank is still low (~30) in two of the datasets. What would explain the difficulty or effectiveness in those cases?\n\nThis reflects the inherent difficulties in these two knowledge graphs, the performance of simple link prediction tasks in these two graphs is also more difficult as shown in many previous research[2,3]. Moreover, the relative performance of FIT against previous methods rather than the absolute performance should be taken into account as we already surpass all baselines in all ten query types in Table 1. Finally, we want to stress that having around 30 percent MRR is not a very low score, as it indicates that every answer is ranked third among tens of thousands of entities.\n\n\n> Presentation - The computation of the Cu(node) from the probability of the relations, is not provided in the paper (It should be in the main paper, not the appendix, to allow for key aspects to be presented as a whole). The introduction could be clearer about how or why this fuzzy approach (or neural symbolic approach) is required for incomplete KGs. Are there other benefits of it?\n\nWe thank you for your advice that the computation details should be included in the main paper. In general, we aim to summarize the important points in the main paper and leave the details to the appendix. Regarding the methodology, we have given an example shown in Figure 4 and explained in Section 5.3 to help the audience understand, specifically, this example has included all three features that should be taken into account according to our Theorem 16: existential leaf, multigraph, and cyclic graph. Moreover, Section 5.4 has clearly given some theoretical guarantees (Theorem 21 and Theorem 24), they are all benefits for our fuzzy method. The detail of the computation is in the Appendix and takes 4 pages to finish, therefore, it is challenging for us to provide that in the main paper, and we will try hard to include more discussion for that in the camera-ready version.\n\n>The proof for tree-form not capturing all first order logic queries I am not sure about. The authors suggest that existential leaves cannot be represented, but that does not prove that any FOL query could not be converted into a potentially different tree form structure.\n\nThe whole family of tree-form queries has been defined by Definition 8 which characterizes the expressiveness of the operator tree method, therefore, mathematically speaking, it is impossible to construct other different tree-form queries. Moreover, Theorem 16 and Figure 5 together illustrate that apart from the existential leaves that you mention, multigraph, and cyclic graph can not be represented by tree-form queries, which we believe to be more intuitive for readers to understand.\n\n[1]Zihao Wang, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Wong, and Simon See.

MRR at 30 still means the method very often gets the answer ranked near three, but probably barely at rank 1. For a query to be executed and be useful realiably it should be much higher.\n\nFor the proof, the justification may not be fully sound. A reformulation of a query graph, that avoids existential leaves but can be represented within the tree form definition may be possible. The proof does not show the contradiction that it is never possible with any possibly tricky reformulation."
