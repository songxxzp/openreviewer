We hope the following response addresses your concerns.\n\n**Clarifying the problem statement.**\n\nWe have clarified the problem statement in Section 4 (changes are in blue). Thank you for your suggestion.\n\n**Reason for focusing on text domain.**\n\n> The benchmarks and experiments conducted in the paper are exclusively centered around the text domain. This singular focus could potentially limit the broader applicability of the findings and the relevance of the benchmark across diverse domains within the realm of machine learning.\n\nOur work is about the robustness of reward models to proxy gaming. Currently, reward models are primarily used for fine-tuning LLMs using RLHF or similar methods. These techniques are one of the main ways that people train instruction-following LLMs like ChatGPT, so focusing on the text domain is high-impact. Additionally, the vast majority of research on this topic focuses exclusively on the text domain.\n\nRecently, people have begun to fine-tune multimodal instruction-following models. Research on this topic is still in its infancy, so we felt focusing our benchmark on the text domain was more appropriate. However, our setup could easily be extended to multimodal models in the future when suitable multimodal preference datasets are more widespread.\n\n**Underlying assumption that proxy will undergo optimization pressure.**\n\n> From my perspective, the authors presuppose that the proxy will undergo optimization pressure, and they proceed to evaluate the proxy under this specific condition, using it as a benchmark. However, they fall short of providing a compelling rationale for this assumption.\n\nThis is a standard assumption of the proxy gaming problem. Without optimization, proxy gaming wouldn\u2019t occur in the first place. We describe this briefly in the first paragraph of our introduction. For more background, see [1, 2, 3].\n\n**Selection of gold reward models.**\n\n> the benchmark's credibility is questionable as it is solely based on the performance of one DeBERTa-v3 model, which is insufficient for establishing validity across various model types\n\nWe use several DeBERTa-v3 models (small, base, and large sizes) as gold reward models. We based our selection of the gold reward models on their test accuracy and efficiency. In preliminary experiments, we evaluated other architectures, including T5-11B and LLaMA models. These obtained only marginally higher accuracy, and in some cases lower accuracy, while being much more expensive to evaluate. Thus, we fixed the gold reward models to the highly performant DeBERTa-v3 architecture, which is a common choice for reward modeling and becoming a standard in this area [4, 5, 6]. If we have addressed the thrust of your concerns, we kindly ask that you consider raising your score."

Rather, we use a range of existing optimizers to study proxy gaming. We may have confused you with the section title \u201c4.2 Constructing Stronger Optimizers\u201d, which was an oversight on our part. Our apologies for this. We have changed this section title to \u201c4.2 Optimization Methods\u201d in the updated paper to improve clarity.\n\nThe sources of novelty in our work are as follows.\nWe introduce a standardized evaluation methodology and benchmark for proxy gaming in RLHF settings, which was previously not available. We carefully design the evaluation, including the metrics and gold reward models, and we make our code and datasets fully available. (Prior work on this problem did publicly release code or datasets, and did not develop standardized metrics for measuring proxy gaming, so we hope our public benchmark will facilitate future work on this important problem.)\nContrary to the findings of Gao et al. (2022), we observe larger policies can sometimes cause more severe proxy gaming, demonstrating adversarial effects in the RLHF setting\nWe discover the concerning phenomenon of example-specific proxy gaming, which was not previously known.\nAdversarial training is an intuitively plausible method for improving proxy robustness. We adversarially train proxy reward models using text-based optimizers, and we find that this improves proxy robustness against white-box optimizers but not RL or BoN optimizers. This had not previously been explored, and it suggests that new methods will be needed to improve performance on our benchmark.\n\n[1]: \u201cScalable agent alignment via reward modeling: a research direction\u201d.

There is also a risk that the ensemble could inherit systemic biases or errors present in the training datasets.\n2. Training the proxy model on a fixed dataset without further interaction with the gold model may not reflect the iterative nature of learning and adapting to new data.\n3. There is a missing relevant work \"TextGrad: Advancing Robustness Evaluation in NLP by Gradient-Driven Optimization, ICLR2023\".\n4. The paper notes a significant correlation of gamed examples across different proxy models. This suggests potential inherent weaknesses or biases in the training process or data. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying causes of this correlation or strategies to mitigate it.\n5. The appearance of phase shifts in reward curves during RLHF optimization highlights that current methods may not capture the complexity of policy learning dynamics.

We hope the following response addresses your concerns.\n\n**Quality of gold models.**\n\nThe goal of our benchmark is to provide an automatic environment to study the proxy gaming problem. Using learning-based gold models instead of humans as evaluators greatly decreases cost and improves reproducibility. Furthermore, we take steps to ensure the \u201cgold\u201d models realistically reflect actual human preferences and the RLHF pipeline by 1) training on multiple standard human preference datasets, 2) using an ensemble of such models, and 3) only providing limited query access for training the proxy model.\n\nWe cannot ensure that our datasets encompass all aspects of helpfulness and harmlessness, but this does not affect the validity of the evaluation. The gold models are fixed as ground-truth, following the methodology in Gao et al. (2022). This means that even though they are imperfect, the goal of the proxy model is to match the gold model, so the evaluation is fully valid. In this methodology, the gold model effectively stands in for a human labeler while enabling automatic evaluations.\n\n**Non-interaction with gold model.**\n\n> Training the proxy model on a fixed dataset without further interaction with the gold model may not reflect the iterative nature of learning and adapting to new data.\n\nWe agree that this benchmark can also be used to investigate the dynamic of iterative and adaptive learning and we make our benchmark flexible enough to support such usage. While it is expected that active learning or simply training on more data points is one way of reducing proxy gaming effects, we establish a setting for users to limit query access to the gold model by using the provided comparison dataset for two reasons. 1) Querying humans (or the gold objective) is often expensive in practice. The proxy model is developed exactly due to such restrictions. By limiting query access to the gold model, users can focus on developing robustness techniques that work under resource constraints. 2) Having access to more query access to the gold model can give an unfair advantage for a technique, making comparisons more difficult. If one decides to query the gold model in addition to the comparison dataset, we encourage the user to clearly report such practices to facilitate fair comparison.\n\n**Choice of adversarial attacks.**\n\nPEZ and GBDA are representative of SoTA white-box attacks on text models, which are standard baselines in most papers. We agree that TextGrad is also a relevant attack. We have added it to the related work in the updated paper. Thank you for your suggestion.\n\n\n**Correlation of gamed examples across proxy models.**\n\n> The paper notes a significant correlation of gamed examples across different proxy models. This suggests potential inherent weaknesses or biases in the training process or data. However, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the underlying causes of this correlation or strategies to mitigate it.\n\nThe correlation between gamed examples in the Base and Small proxy models is not itself an issue. It does demonstrate that some aspect of the data distribution is likely causing per-example proxy gaming, and that the gamed examples are not random. This is useful to know, but the issue is that proxy gaming happens at all. The goal of our paper and benchmark is to facilitate future work on developing more robust proxies to ameliorate this problem."

However, I believe most of the setup/data are borrowed from the existing works, in particular, [1], which weakens the originality.\n*  This paper did introduce a novel metric to measure the severity of proxy gaming, namely the difference between the first derivatives of the proxy and golden reward curves as the optimization proceeds (RMSE). However, the authors didn't highlight the importance and necessity of such a metric. The major motivation from what I can see is the phenomenon that proxy gaming can still happen at a subset of the examples even if the expectation of the proxy reward aligns with the gold reward. But it is rather hard to see why the proposed metric can reflect the severity of this problem.\n* Further, I am not sure why the aforementioned phenomenon, which is the major discovery of this paper, is important itself. I believe using the expected target across the data examples as a metric is rather a standard practice for probably any learning problem. Randomness always exists in the dataset and considering, for example, a worst-case target as a metric, is probably impractical.\n* Nevertheless, such a phenomenon can indeed be important if the subset of examples experiencing serious proxy gaming, is relatively consistent across different proxy models. Because this points to some fundamental behavior changes of the policy model, which may lead to arbitrarily worse golden reward if the data distribution for evaluation is skewed towards the favor of the policy model. To clarify this, the authors did mention that this phenomenon may not be random at the end of Section 5.1, and that the policy model may exploit the flaw of the proxy in Section 5.4. However, there is no quantitative result mentioned, especially for the former, making it hard to judge whether they are indeed the case.\n\n* Finally, I believe this is an interesting paper and has great potential. But it may not be well-organized in its current form. Personally, I would prefer pitching it as a comprehensive analysis of the proxy gaming problem, rather than as a benchmark. But certainly the former would require more extensive empirical results for more soundness.\n\n* [Minor point] The related work is a little bit lacking and makes it quite difficult for people to catch up, as I believe the focused problem is brand new. The authors should at least introduce RLHF before reward modeling and proxy gaming.\n\n\n[1] Scaling laws for reward model overoptimization. Gao et al., 2022."

                        "value": "Thank you for your careful analysis of our work. We hope the following response addresses your concerns.\n\n**Contributions relative to prior work.**\nThere are three important shortcomings with the work of Gao et al. (2022) that we overcome in our paper: 1) they don\u2019t release the code or the dataset which limits applicability, 2) they don\u2019t introduce standardized metrics that reliably track progress, and 3) we have a series of qualitatively different results that are worthy of investigation (e.g., contrary to their findings, we observe larger policies can sometimes cause more severe proxy gaming, demonstrating adversarial effects in the RLHF setting).\n\n**Motivation for RMS metric.**\n\n> The major motivation from what I can see is the phenomenon that proxy gaming can still happen at a subset of the examples even if the expectation of the proxy reward aligns with the gold reward.\n\nThis is not actually the motivation for our RMS metric. We do have a \u201c% of Examples Gamed\u201d metric for this, but the motivation for our RMS metric is to simply measure the average amount of proxy gaming across a dataset of examples. The closest prior work to ours, Gao et al. (2022), does not propose a quantitative metric for proxy gaming, so we developed a suitable metric for measuring proxy gaming based on the shape of reward curves.\n\n**Importance of per-example proxy gaming.**\n\n> I am not sure why the aforementioned phenomenon, which is the major discovery of this paper, is important itself.\n\nThe importance of our discovery of per-example proxy gaming is that it demonstrates proxy gaming can still occur even when the dataset-level proxy reward curve tracks the dataset-level gold reward curve. This is concerning, because a standard choice when using RLHF is to simply monitor dataset-level statistics, especially because computing higher-quality gold rewards is assumed to be costly. One might naively assume that a slight mismatch between the dataset-level curves is due to a slight mismatch in the reward curves for most examples. Our results demonstrate that in fact, this is often due to severe proxy gaming on a subset of examples, which is concerning from a safety perspective.\n\n> I believe using the expected target across the data examples as a metric is rather a standard practice for probably any learning problem.\n\nAbsolutely! Our RMS metric is a standard metric for measuring the difference in shape between two curves, and we average it over all the examples in our dataset. This measures the average amount of proxy gaming on a dataset level. The \u201c% of Examples Gamed\u201d metric is specifically motivated by our novel observation that subsets of examples can experience severe proxy gaming.\n\n**Clarifying the degree of per-example proxy gaming.**\n\nOur apologies for not being clear about the quantitative setup in Section 5.1. We observe that over 45% of the gamed examples in the Base proxy model also coincide with the gamed subset of examples in the Small proxy model. Running a simple hypothesis test compared to if the gamed examples were chosen at random, we find that there is a near zero probability of having 45% of the gamed examples overlap, thus rejecting the null hypothesis. We have clarified this in the updated paper thanks to your suggestion.\n\n\n**Reasons for developing a proxy gaming benchmark.**\n\nThe primary goal of our paper is to facilitate the development of more robust proxy reward models. As shown by Gao et al. (2022), proxy gaming in RLHF is a serious problem. There are many possible research avenues for developing more robust proxy reward models, such as adversarial training and incorporating uncertainty. However, measuring proxy gaming can be challenging, and there is not yet any standardized evaluation for proxy gaming. For these reasons, we decided to create a standardized evaluation that would make it much easier for future work to explore ways of improving robustness.\n\nWhile our paper does include some interesting discoveries and analysis in addition to the benchmark, we view the benchmark as an important contribution that we hope will facilitate more work in this area.\n\n\n**Placement of RLHF in the related work.**\n\nThe \u201cReward Modeling\u201d paragraph at the top of our related work includes the standard InstructGPT RLHF paper as well as more recent methods like Constitutional AI. We assume familiarity with RLHF in our paper, so we don\u2019t provide an explainer, but readers can easily link to the RLHF papers from our related work to learn more."

We hope the following response addresses your concerns.\n\n**Reasoning behind our RMS metric.**\n\nThere are many possible metrics for quantifying the difference between two curves, such as the one you\u2019re suggesting. However, the proxy gaming effect is mainly manifested in the reward curves having different shapes (which is better captured with second-order properties) instead of the \u201cgap\u201d between the reward curves. Consider a simple example R_gold = [4,2,2,1,1,1], R_proxy1 = [8,4,4,2,2,2], R_proxy2 = [0,1,2,2,2,3], where only R_proxy2 exhibits severe proxy gaming effects because the proxy reward increases while the gold reward decreases. Such relative directions can be better tracked by a metric that uses the second-order property. P\u2019 = P[1:] - P[:-1].\n\n\n**Title of paper.**\n\nFor the camera-ready version, we can change the title of the paper to \u201cRobustness Evaluation of Text-Based Proxy Models Against Optimization Pressure\u201d. Let us know if this looks good to you. Thank you for your suggestion. If we have addressed the thrust of your concerns, we kindly ask that you consider raising your score.\n\n**Responses to questions**\n\n> The gold objective here is also a learning-based model constructed from a few dataset. Have the authors evaluated how \"gold\" these models are?\n\nThe goal of this benchmark is to provide an automatic environment to study the proxy gaming problem. Using learning-based gold models instead of humans as evaluators greatly decreases cost and improves reproducibility. Furthermore, we take steps to ensure the \u201cgold\u201d models realistically reflect actual human preferences and the RLHF pipeline by 1) training on multiple standard human preference datasets, 2) using an ensemble of such models, and 3) only providing limited query access for training the proxy model.\n\n> Any intuition of the claim \"This might be explained by a larger policy providing a stronger attack and finding more ways to exploit the proxy model.\" in the first part of Section 5.2?\n\nLarger policy models afford a larger search space for RL, since there are more parameters to modify. Hence, they are stronger optimizers and more capable of overfitting to a proxy.\n\n> In classification or regression problems, adversarial training may hurt the performance on the clean input, does the adversarial training technique introduced in Section 5.5 hurt the performance when the proxy model is not adversarial?\n\nExactly as you point out, we observe performance degradation of the adversarially trained models and report the accuracies in Table 4. The PEZ column refers to adversarial training using the PEZ optimizer. We have clarified this in the updated paper."
