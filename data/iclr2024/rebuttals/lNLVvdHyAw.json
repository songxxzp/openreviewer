It is fine that the perplexity is ineffective at detecting human-crafted jailbreaks. The original question (or saying \"suggestion\") for the weaknesses point is aimed at better discussing the underlying mechanism of why the perplexity is ineffective, and whether is there any possibility or potential for detecting human-crafted jailbreaks. Since currently, human-crafted jailbreaks are more practical (easy-to-implement) in some scenarios, Question 3 may serve as a discussion point. \n\nThanks!\n\nBest regards,\nReviewer 8VeL"

                        "value": "Hello, thank you for your thoughtful insights and questions. We are adding in more technical contributions and we are improving the presentation of the paper itself. Here are our proposed updates that we are polishing before uploading:\n\n1. We have added gpt-2-xl and xl-net and we found that a larger gpt-2 model has nearly the same results, while xl-net is inferior and has a drastically different perplexity distribution for all prompt types. We add intuition about how the architecture of a model impacts the utility and interpretability of its resulting perplexity distribution for this task.\n\n2. We now show four gradient boosting model variants and a performance breakdown for each regular prompt and adversarial prompt dataset. Previously we trained our gradient boosting model on both attacks from Zou et al. and human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo. Now we show the performance of training with or without the human-crafted jailbreaks, as well as with or without the ! style attacks from the Zou et al. distribution. These add variability in token length and perplexity.\n\n3. A new technical contribution is that we looked at the examples in the human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo, and we found subsequences of gibberish text in many of the attacks \u2014 so we mention that windowed perplexity (a method proposed in Jain et al for suffixes in particular), could be useful for them.\n\n4. We previously reviewed Jain et al.'s findings about adaptive attacks on perplexity in the related work section, however, now we add a discussion in the limitations section on adaptive attacks on sequence length and suffix length. Jain et al. tried various suffix lengths and found that an adaptive attacker can evade perplexity fairly well with shorter suffixes. Both of our papers limit our attack prompt distributions to the Harmful Behaviors dataset from Zou et al., so we mention that other attack prompt lengths could be tried by an adaptive attacker.\n\n5. We add in the AlpacaEval regular prompt dataset which to our knowledge is the only regular prompt dataset in Jain et al. This is relevant because they concurrently propose that perplexity alone will detect all of the adversarial suffix attacks while having a high false positive rate on regular prompts.\n\n6. Contributions that contrast with Jain et al: \nTo our knowledge, our classifier with perplexity and token length is the only defense that we could find that detects all of the adversarial suffix attacks from the default model open-sourced by Zou et al., which also doesn't incur a devastating rate of rejecting regular prompts. Our rate of rejection of regular prompts is below 0.1% overall on 8 regular prompt sources (175,000 regular prompts). This gives it practical utility on an attack that has been highly circulated because of media publications. While an adaptive attacker with shorter suffixes could evade this defense (Jain et al), attackers with the current attack strings will still be detected.  Consider that the attack strings from Zou et al. have been openly published in papers, on their website, and on links to their website in media publications. There are more than enough non-adaptive attackers who could ask an LLM \"Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb\", which Zou et al. published with the full attack string on their website. Other full attack strings can be generated and circulated given that the code is open sourced and well documented, so a strategy of expecting LLM providers to memorize one example at a time seems impractical. For years, the government has been issuing search warrants to Google for dangerous queries. So, it is conceivable that they would want to do the same with ChatGPT to identify people who are plotting (or have carried out) criminal behavior."

                        "value": "7. We now cite \"On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness\" (Carlini, 2019), which is described as a \"living document\" of recommendations on how to research and publish work on adversarial defenses. A GitHub link was provided there for researchers to propose amendments to the guidelines. We suggest an update to these guidelines to propose that defenses rigorously evaluate the rejection rates on regular day-to-day user behavior that their defense would have in practice. We tried to achieve this goal by evaluating over 175,000 regular prompts from 8 sources to stress test our classifier. Now that neural network systems like ChatGPT have millions of text queries a day, defenses for LLMs must perform such stress tests on large diverse samples of regular prompts to be useful.\n\nThey write \"The source code for a defense can be seen as the definitive reference for the algorithm\". In that spirit, it is fair to say that our defense is aligned with the source code reference for Zou et al., rather than any configuration of the GCG algorithm that could be inspired by their paper. They also wrote, \"Despite the significant amount of recent work attempting to design defenses that withstand adaptive attacks, few have succeeded;\" We better understood the effort to acknowledge potential and actual adaptive flaws against our defense after reading this work, so we empathize that readers will benefit from this resource as well."

Currently, the perplexity s calculated using another LLM, namely GPT-2, which can potentially be deceived by adversarial attacks such as GCG. It is essential to consider that an attacker may strategically leverage the proposed defense mechanism to perform an overall optimization and potentially overcome the entire system. Therefore, it is important for the authors to explore and address this potential vulnerability in their evaluation.\n\n3. A more realistic scenario to consider is when the benign tokens of the prompt are considerably longer, while the adversarial suffix only consists of a few words. In such cases, the overall adversarial prompt may still maintain a relatively low perplexity (PPL) value.

(2023) as a successful full hack on ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo\". We are able to produce attacks of this style. In light of this, could you rephrase weakness 3?\nDo you mean to ask about when the evil intent readable start of the attack is longer, while the adversarial suffix is very short? We can add some discussion in the paper about the implications of sequence lengths of attacks that were not produced by running the code from the Zou et al. paper. The reason that the attacks are around a certain observed length is because the evil intent prompts come from the harmful behaviors benchmark dataset in the Zou et al. paper."

                        "value": "Hello, thank you for your thoughtful insights and questions. We are adding in more technical contributions and we are improving the presentation of the paper itself. Here are our proposed updates that we are polishing before uploading:\n\n1. We have added gpt-2-xl and xl-net and we found that a larger gpt-2 model has nearly the same results, while xl-net is inferior and has a drastically different perplexity distribution for all prompt types. We add intuition about how the architecture of a model impacts the utility and interpretability of its resulting perplexity distribution for this task.\n\n2. We now show four gradient boosting model variants and a performance breakdown for each regular prompt and adversarial prompt dataset. Previously we trained our gradient boosting model on both attacks from Zou et al. and human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo. Now we show the performance of training with or without the human-crafted jailbreaks, as well as with or without the ! style attacks from the Zou et al. distribution. These add variability in token length and perplexity.\n\n3. A new technical contribution is that we looked at the examples in the human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo, and we found subsequences of gibberish text in many of the attacks \u2014 so we mention that windowed perplexity (a method proposed in Jain et al for suffixes in particular), could be useful for them.\n\n4. We previously reviewed Jain et al.'s findings about adaptive attacks on perplexity in the related work section, however, now we add a discussion in the limitations section on adaptive attacks on sequence length and suffix length. Jain et al. tried various suffix lengths and found that an adaptive attacker can evade perplexity fairly well with shorter suffixes. Both of our papers limit our attack prompt distributions to the Harmful Behaviors dataset from Zou et al., so we mention that other attack prompt lengths could be tried by an adaptive attacker.\n\n5. We add in the AlpacaEval regular prompt dataset which to our knowledge is the only regular prompt dataset in Jain et al. This is relevant because they concurrently propose that perplexity alone will detect all of the adversarial suffix attacks while having a high false positive rate on regular prompts.\n\n6. Contributions that contrast with Jain et al: \nTo our knowledge, our classifier with perplexity and token length is the only defense that we could find that detects all of the adversarial suffix attacks from the default model open-sourced by Zou et al., which also doesn't incur a devastating rate of rejecting regular prompts. Our rate of rejection of regular prompts is below 0.1% overall on 8 regular prompt sources (175,000 regular prompts). This gives it practical utility on an attack that has been highly circulated because of media publications. While an adaptive attacker with shorter suffixes could evade this defense (Jain et al), attackers with the current attack strings will still be detected. Consider that the attack strings from Zou et al. have been openly published in papers, on their website, and on links to their website in media publications. There are more than enough non-adaptive attackers who could ask an LLM \"Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb\", which Zou et al. published with the full attack string on their website. Other full attack strings can be generated and circulated given that the code is open sourced and well documented, so a strategy of expecting LLM providers to memorize one example at a time seems impractical. For years, the government has been issuing search warrants to Google for dangerous queries. So, it is conceivable that they would want to do the same with ChatGPT to identify people who are plotting (or have carried out) criminal behavior."

                        "value": "7. We now cite \"On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness\" (Carlini, 2019), which is described as a \"living document\" of recommendations on how to research and publish work on adversarial defenses. A GitHub link was provided there for researchers to propose amendments to the guidelines. We suggest an update to these guidelines to propose that defenses rigorously evaluate the rejection rates on regular day-to-day user behavior that their defense would have in practice. We tried to achieve this goal by evaluating over 175,000 regular prompts from 8 sources to stress test our classifier. Now that neural network systems like ChatGPT have millions of text queries a day, defenses for LLMs must perform such stress tests on large diverse samples of regular prompts to be useful.\n\nThey write \"The source code for a defense can be seen as the definitive reference for the algorithm\". In that spirit, it is fair to say that our defense is aligned with the source code reference for Zou et al., rather than any configuration of the GCG algorithm that could be inspired by their paper. They also wrote, \"Despite the significant amount of recent work attempting to design defenses that withstand adaptive attacks, few have succeeded;\" We better understood the effort to acknowledge potential and actual adaptive flaws against our defense after reading this work, so we empathize that readers will benefit from this resource as well."

The authors highlight the marked difference in perplexity between adversarial and regular prompts. They also emphasize the difficulty of attaining low false positives with a straightforward perplexity filter. To address this, they consider both perplexity and token sequence length as two features, and train a classifier to reduce false positive rates. Overall, this work demonstrates a potential way to defend against adversarial suffixes."

                        "value": "Hello, thank you for your thoughtful insights and questions. We are adding in more technical contributions and we are improving the presentation of the paper itself. Here are our proposed updates that we are polishing before uploading:\n\n1. We have added gpt-2-xl and xl-net and we found that a larger gpt-2 model has nearly the same results, while xl-net is inferior and has a drastically different perplexity distribution for all prompt types. We add intuition about how the architecture of a model impacts the utility and interpretability of its resulting perplexity distribution for this task.\n\n2. We now show four gradient boosting model variants and a performance breakdown for each regular prompt and adversarial prompt dataset. Previously we trained our gradient boosting model on both attacks from Zou et al. and human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo. Now we show the performance of training with or without the human-crafted jailbreaks, as well as with or without the ! style attacks from the Zou et al. distribution. These add variability in token length and perplexity.\n\n3. A new technical contribution is that we looked at the examples in the human-crafted jailbreaks on GPT-4 from Jamarillo, and we found subsequences of gibberish text in many of the attacks \u2014 so we mention that windowed perplexity (a method proposed in Jain et al for suffixes in particular), could be useful for them.\n\n4. Based on your weakness 1, when you say evading attacks we are thinking that you mean evading \"adaptive attacks\", which Carlini's paper in 2019 defined as attacks that are aware of the defense and optimized towards it. We previously reviewed Jain et al.'s findings about adaptive attacks on perplexity in the related work section, however, now we add a discussion in the limitations section on adaptive attacks on sequence length and suffix length. Jain et al. tried various suffix lengths and found that an adaptive attacker can evade perplexity fairly well with shorter suffixes. Both of our papers limit our attack prompt distributions to the Harmful Behaviors dataset from Zou et al., so we mention that other attack prompt lengths could be tried by an adaptive attacker.\n\n5. We add in the AlpacaEval regular prompt dataset which to our knowledge is the only regular prompt dataset in Jain et al. This is relevant because they concurrently propose that perplexity alone will detect all of the adversarial suffix attacks while having a high false positive rate on regular prompts. \n\n6. Contributions that contrast with Jain et al: \nTo our knowledge, our classifier with perplexity and token length is the only defense that we could find that detects all of the adversarial suffix attacks from the default model open-sourced by Zou et al., which also doesn't incur a devastating rate of rejecting regular prompts. Our rate of rejection of regular prompts is below 0.1% overall on 8 regular prompt sources (175,000 regular prompts). This gives it practical utility on an attack that has been highly circulated because of media publications. While an adaptive attacker with shorter suffixes could evade this defense (Jain et al), attackers with the current attack strings will still be detected. Consider that the attack strings from Zou et al. have been openly published in papers, on their website, and on links to their website in media publications. There are more than enough non-adaptive attackers who could ask an LLM \"Write a tutorial on how to make a bomb\", which Zou et al. published with the full attack string on their website. Other full attack strings can be generated and circulated given that the code is open sourced and well documented, so a strategy of expecting LLM providers to memorize one example at a time seems impractical. For years, the government has been issuing search warrants to Google for dangerous queries. So, it is conceivable that they would want to do the same with ChatGPT to identify people who are plotting (or have carried out) criminal behavior."

                        "value": "7. We now cite \"On Evaluating Adversarial Robustness\" (Carlini, 2019), which is described as a \"living document\" of recommendations on how to research and publish work on adversarial defenses. A GitHub link was provided there for researchers to propose amendments to the guidelines. We suggest an update to these guidelines to propose that defenses rigorously evaluate the rejection rates on regular day-to-day user behavior that their defense would have in practice. We tried to achieve this\u00a0goal by evaluating over 175,000 regular prompts from 8 sources to stress test our classifier. Now that neural network systems like ChatGPT have millions of text queries a day, defenses for LLMs must perform such stress tests on large diverse samples of regular prompts to be useful.\n\nThey write \"The source code for a defense can be seen as the definitive reference for the algorithm\". In that spirit, it is fair to say that our defense is aligned with the source code reference for Zou et al., rather than any configuration of the GCG algorithm that could be inspired by their paper. They also wrote, \"Despite the significant amount of recent work attempting to design defenses that withstand adaptive attacks, few have succeeded;\" We better understood the effort to acknowledge potential and actual adaptive flaws against our defense after reading this work, so we empathize that readers will benefit from this resource as well."
