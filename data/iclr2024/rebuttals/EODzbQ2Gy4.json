                    "value": "This paper introduces Diff-Transfer, a model-based algorithm for transferring manipulation skills by discovering a path from the source task to the target task within the task space. The method views each task as a state-action trajectory, and defines the task using the change of object pose from the initial state to the goal state. Consequently, a path of tasks can define a transfer from the source task to the target task. The transfer can then be solved by optimizing the action sequence based on the gradient from a differentiable simulation. In the end, Q-learning is used for path planning on the task space to find the sub-tasks."

The TransferStep algorithm adapts from one task to the next by iteratively (i) rolling out the current actions in the environment; (ii) computing the error in the object displacement; (iii) updating the actions by propagating gradients through the rollout.\n\nAssuming I have understood this correctly, I have a few questions and comments:\n1) How robust is the approach to different kinds of transfer gap? Transferring from a pushing task to another (or opening/closing different amounts, or moving an object to a different configuration) may be reasonable, but what about more challenging cases, where the behaviour or affordance might change, or the task might reuse multiple existing skills? Eg. placing an object \u2192 inserting an object somewhere else, reaching and grasping an object \u2192 lifting an object.\n2) If the method is not intended to transfer to different behaviours (only different object displacements), why not just perform planning on the target task directly? TransferStep itself appears to be a form of trajectory optimisation at each step, and at least for the tasks presented in the experiments (which are all relatively simple single-stage manipulation tasks with the object pose changing), I would expect both source and target task to be solvable by planning with the differentiable simulator.\n\n**Experiments**\n\nThe authors claim a \u201crigorous experimental framework\u201d and an \u201cexhaustive evaluation\u201d, but the only evaluation is with 4 source/target tasks and weaker baselines (see my comment below), with a single ablation for the different planning methods used to determine intermediate goals.\n\nThe comparison to baselines is not compelling in my opinion, as I would expect them to not succeed in the applied setting.\nFor example, MAML is a meta-learning approach that learns a good parameter initialisation for adaptation by learning-to-adapt on a very large distribution of tasks. As such, I don\u2019t find it surprising that it fails when training on 4 source tasks (I would expect it to only be useful here if trained on many variants of the same task and adapted to another variant). It feels like the wrong fit for a baseline, and something like finetuning via RL or planning would make more sense to me.\nSimilarly the direct transfer approach applies the same TransferStep algorithm but without the intermediary goals - as such it is more of an ablation without the planning stage.\n\n**Minor comments**\nFigure 1 is confusing. I think it means \u201cto select the best candidate for the (i+1)th subtask\u2026\u201d. The current wording makes it seem like the output of the q function is something else, which \u2018generates\u2019 the task.\n\n**Summary**\nWhile I was intrigued by the theoretical development, I think there unfortunately needs to be more evidence that this method could be useful for challenging tasks, along with more clarity around why the proposed problem setting and solution could be useful versus eg. planning in the target domain."

They propose a path planning method which splits the problem of transfer from source to target task into multiple subtasks. Each subtask is a new sample in goal space which is evaluated by a learned critic network. The action sequence is then provided via the differentiable physics simulation."

Word choice is a bit flamboyant in multiple places in the writing.\n- This paper seems to only be tackle in-distribution task-transfer where typically transfer is thought of as learning task A can help with a completely different task B.\n- Additionally, object shape transfer is mentioned as one of the applications, but only object pose transfer is considered in the experiments.\n- Reward function seems to be very hand-engineered. How many data points is required to fit the Q-network with the pretraining dataset? Is this dataset hard to collect?\n- Is there any comparison with other works that use differentiable physics for task transfer? \n- One of the claimed novelty in this work is the path planning algorithm for sampling new subtasks. Can you include more comparisons against other path planning algorithms in classical literature like RRT, A*, sampling-based methods, etc?\n\nTypo and writing comments:\n\nFigure 1: Sub-Task Accomplishment ... \n\nSection 5.2 MAML: repeated the word \"application\"\n\nConfusing last sentence in Section 5.1.4. \n\nSection 5.3, why is this transfer task considered \"innovative\"?"
