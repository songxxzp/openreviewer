                    "value": "In this paper, the authors give the first computationally efficient tester-learner for learning halfspaces where the target distribution is the d-variate Gaussian and the label noise is Massart or adversarial. The tester-learner framework was recently proposed as a generation to the distribution-specific learning setting where the algorithm needs to accept a dataset whenever it comes from a target distribution and needs to achieve the agnostic learning guarantee (error = $opt + \\varepsilon$) whenever it accepts. Previous work only gave a sample-optimal tester learner for the same problem which was not computationally efficient. The main technical novelty in this work is tester that looks at the labels as opposed to the label-oblivious testers previously designed. For the adversarial noise setting, the authors achieve the suboptimal risk $O(opt) + \\varepsilon$.\n\nThe authors build on the non-convex optimization approach of [DKTZ] which uses the a smoothed version of the ramp loss as a surrogate to the zero one loss. Although this is a non-convex function, it was shown that the stationary points are good solution which can be recovered by projected SGD as the first step under the Gaussianity assumption. In the testing-learning framework, we need to additionally check the following assumption: the probability masses of certain regions are proportional to their geometric measures. The tester checks local properties of the distribution in regions described by the stationary points using moment matching techniques. Naively, such a check could only guarantee the empirical mass is additively close to the true mass. However, using a refined moment test conditioned on a band based on the stationary vector (similar to the existing localization-based refinement techniques of Awasti et al. 2017) they could get the stronger multiplicative guarantee. This allows them to argue that if the test passes, the stationary points will indeed be close to the true weight vector in angular distance. This in turn means the returned vectors are good solutions using properties of Gaussian. The later step results in a larger error for the adversarial noise setting as opposed to the Massart noise setting."

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive comments and your time.\n\n**Q1:** The focus of our paper is theoretical and we did not optimize the constants or run experiments. Prior to our work, the best algorithm of [GKK \u201823] ran in time $d^{O(1/\\epsilon^2)}$, which gets exponentially worse as $\\epsilon$ decreases. In this work we show that a run-time of poly$(d, \\epsilon)$ can be achieved laying the groundwork for practical algorithms for this task. We note that one difficulty with running experiments is that the guarantees in this paper (and the agnostic learning literature more broadly) hold in the worst case over all forms of adversarial label noise. When building a synthetic dataset, it is not obvious how to pick the noise in a way that exercises and demonstrates this worst-case guarantee.\n\n**Q2:** We believe that tester-learners which handle linear classifiers with non-zero offset terms may be significantly different from ours, given the fact that in standard distribution-specific agnostic learning the techniques used to handle halfspaces with non-zero offset terms are quite different from the techniques used here. See [Diakonikolas, Kontonis, Tzamos, Zarifis, \u201822] and [Diakonikolas, Kane, Stewart 2018] for further detail.\n\n**Q3:** The testers $T_1, T_2$ and $T_3$ do not use labels internally. However, testers $T_2$ and $T_3$ receive $\\mathbf w$ as an input and $\\mathbf w$ is computed using labelled examples (see Algorithm 1). Therefore, the tests we perform are indeed label-dependent, but the testers $T_1,T_2,T_3$ do not need to receive labelled examples per se. Additionally, thank you for pointing out the typo.\n\n\n*References:*\n\nDiakonikolas, I., Kontonis, V., Tzamos, C., & Zarifis, N. (2022, June).

                        "value": "We wish to thank the anonymous reviewer for their time and for appreciating of our work!\n\n**Q1:** Running tester $T_3$ with a given parameter $\\sigma$ does not necessarily guarantee this tester accepts also for bigger parameter values $\\sigma\u2019$. Intuitively, this is because $\\sigma$ denotes the width of a band around a given halfspace that the tester focuses on. Our analysis requires that the distribution is well-behaved for two different values of the band size $\\sigma/2$ and $\\sigma/6$, and therefore we run the tester $T_3$ for these two values separately.\n\n**Q2:** Since every testable learning algorithm will also satisfy the requirements for a distribution-specific agnostic learning, known hardness results for distribution-specific agnostic learning (such as [DK '22] and [DKMR '22]) also imply hardness of testable learning. We note that our tester-learner algorithms can be formulated in the SQ framework.\n\n**Q3:** The algorithm 1 does not compute function class $\\mathcal F_{w}$, we only mention it as a comment for the reader to better understand what the various testers $T_1$, $T_2$ and $T_3$ accomplish. In particular, the class $\\mathcal F_{w}$ is the class of functions that the marginal distribution (conditioned on the strip) has to fool in order to ensure soundness. For example, one function in $\\mathcal F_{w}$ is $f$ such that $f(x) = 1$ for any $x\\in A_2$ ($A_2$ as in Figure 1) and $f(x)=-1$ for any $x$ in the strip ($|x\\cdot w| \\le \\sigma$), but $x$ not in $A_2$. Note that $f$ can be defined as an intersection of two halfspaces (orthogonal to $w$), since we only care about the values within the strip."

The main feature of this framework is that it requires learning algorithms that learn near-optimal predictors whenever the input training sample passes a test (soundness), and also training samples pass the test whenever the distributional assumptions are met (completeness). \n\nThe paper gives polynomial-time testable learning algorithms for halfspaces when the marginal distribution is isotropic log-concave and:\n(a) under Massart noise, guarantee error at most OPT + \\epsilon. [Theorem 4.1]\n(b). under adversarial noise, guarantee error at most O(OPT) + \\epsilon. [Theorem 5.1]"

To establish these results, the paper contributes new testing procedures that go beyond the limitations of prior work (Gollakota, Klivans, Kothari, 2023). Additionally, the techniques of this paper have also led to more general results in testable-learning (Gollakota, Klivans, Stavropoulos, Vasilyan, 2023). \n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to read. The authors do a great job discussing prior work, and how the paper fits with related literature."

If I understood correctly (based on page 2, subsequent work paragraph), there is some non-overlap in the techniques used in both papers, and so this paper may still be beneficial to the community."
