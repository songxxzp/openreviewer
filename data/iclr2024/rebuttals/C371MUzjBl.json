                    "value": "As mentioned by the authors, the basic idea of using the sequence form to speed up column generation/double oracle for extensive-form games was proposed by Bosansky et al (2014). I do appreciate the authors' frank discussion of this comparison (Appendix A), but I think this should be reflected in the framing of the paper (e.g., perhaps Bosansky et al.'s method should be introduced in the body, and then the proposed DCG method should be framed as the natural analogue of that method for adversarial team games). I think the current framing of DCG makes it seem like it is more complex of a method than it really is. Phrased another way, in some sense I think Appendix A is the most important part of this paper from a conceptual standpoint, and it should be as much as possible moved into the body/discussed earlier, maybe even in the introduction. (if space is needed, for example, I'd suggest moving some of the ablation experiments, or the discussion of the BRO to the appendix; these matters are in my opinion less important than correct positioning of the work within past literature).\n\nFor the BRO, there should be some discussion of the total size of the representation (number of nonzeros in constraint matrix), as a function of e.g. the number of sequences, number of players, game size, etc. It seems to me that this size can be exponential in |H| in the worst case (when the number of players is large), which is somewhat troubling especially compared to past BROs which, as you say in Appendix A, do not have this problem. (For example, consider a polymatrix game with $N$ players and $A$ actions per player converted in the natural manner to extensive form---such a game would have $|H| = O((NA)^2)$ but every tuple of sequences will be relevant, so the  BRO will have representation size something like $A^N$).\n\nOn a more minor note, I would also like to see experiments on team-vs-team games, in which both teams would have to apply this column-generation method. In that setting, my guess would be the advantage over the baseline DAG algorithm will be less, because of the added inefficiency of having to perform CG for both sides---but I would still expect the method to perform very well."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your helpful comments. We have uploaded a new version of the paper to address your comments. \n\n**Comment**: About moving the related work in Appendix A to the main body of the paper.\\\n**A**: Thanks for giving us this interesting idea. We once put all related work in the main body of the paper, but the space is not enough. So, we summarized the related work in Section 3 and presented details in Appendix A. Specifically, at the beginning of Section 3, we present:\n\nSolving Problem (1) is challenging because the team\u2019s coordinated strategy space is exponential in the size of the game tree. With the procedure shown in Figure 1(c), CG can mitigate this challenge but still converges slowly in large games due to such a large strategy space. It has been shown that the TB-DAG-based algorithms are more efficient than CG in games with a small TB-DAG (Zhang et al., 2022b;c). However, solving Problem (1) through the TB-DAG is impractical in large games because the size of the TB-DAG is still exponential in the size of the game tree (Zhang et al., 2022c). To speed up, one straightforward idea is applying CG with the procedure shown in Figure 1(c) to the TB-DAG, which also is the direct application of the sequence-form double oracle (Bosansky et al., 2014) to the TB-DAG. That is, we compute a TMECor with a limited size of the TB-DAG, and then expand the DAG by computing a best response over the whole TB-DAG form strategy space, i.e., solving the problem: max_{\\boldsymbol{x}} u_T (\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y}_o). However, it is inefficient to compute a best response over the whole exponential-sized TB-DAG. As shown in experiments, this exponential size will make CG with the DAG-based BRO very inefficient. More details on related work are shown in Appendix A.\n\n**Comment**: About presenting the viewpoint of applying the sequence-form double oracle Bosansky et al. (2014) algorithm to ATGs.\\\n**A**: Thanks again for your interesting idea. We once considered presenting the viewpoint of applying the sequence-form double oracle Bosansky et al. (2014) algorithm to ATGs. However, compared to the current viewpoint of applying CG to the TB-DAG, both viewpoints give us the same procedure and do not need the key features of the sequence-form double oracle algorithm in Bosansky et al. (2014), but using CG is the tradition in the mainstream literature on ATGs (Celli & Gatti, 2018; Farina et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Farina et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022b). Therefore, we chose the current viewpoint of applying CG to the TB-DAG:\nRecall that the sequence-form double oracle algorithm in Bosansky et al. (2014) is only for two-player extensive-form perfect-recall zero-sum games. However, as we mentioned, an ATG is an imperfect-recall game. Thus, the algorithm in Bosansky et al. (2014) cannot be directly applied to original ATGs. To apply the algorithm in Bosansky et al. (2014) for solving ATGs, we need to transform the original strategy representation of ATGs into the TB-DAG form. Then, we can compute a TMECor with a limited size of the TB-DAG for the restricted game and then expand the TB-DAG by computing a best response over the whole TB-DAG of the original game. Unfortunately, it is inefficient to compute a best response over the whole exponential-sized TB-DAG. Therefore, the sequence-form double oracle algorithm in Bosansky et al. (2014) that is directly applied to the TB-DAG is inefficient in large games. To improve the scalability, similar to Section 3, we can propose a novel sequence-form oracle algorithm framework that includes 1) computing a coordinated best response, 2) transforming this coordinated best response to the TB-DAG form, and then 3) adding this equivalent TB-DAG form strategy to the restricted game. This algorithm framework has an extra transformation step and needs a suitable BRO to reduce the cost of the transformation. We can see that the above algorithm procedure is the same as our current DCG. We chose to present our algorithm from the viewpoint of applying CG to the TB-DAG because:\n\n1.\tAs we mentioned, both viewpoints will result in the same algorithm.\n\n2.\tIn the mainstream literature on ATGs (Celli & Gatti, 2018; Farina et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021; Farina et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2022b), CG was used to solve ATGs because the team\u2019s strategy space is in normal form and is exponentially larger than the strategy space of the opponent (adversary). \n\n3.\tBecause the strategy space of the opponent (adversary) is exponentially smaller than the team\u2019s strategy space, we only expand the strategy space of the team. Thus, we do not need the key features of the sequence-form double oracle algorithm (Bosansky et al., 2014) in the restricted game (i.e., incomplete strategy and unallowed actions), as we mentioned in Appendix A.1.\n\nWe added Appendix A.2 in the new version to discuss the viewpoint of applying the sequence-form double oracle Bosansky et al. (2014) algorithm to ATGs."

The main idea is that of combining the two algorithms currently used in the literature, Column Generation and DAG/belief-based representation. The proposed algorithm employs column generation for equilibrium computation on a reduced version of the game, while adopting the faster equilibrium computation enabled by the DAG. The role of the best response routine is to progressively expands the DAG representation.\n\nThe paper shows that this procedure does not worsen the theoretical bounds of the previous algorithms, and thoroughly evaluates different variants of the main algorithm on a large suite of games."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your insightful comments. We have uploaded a new version of the paper to address your comments. \n\n**Comment**: No clear winner between \\emph{pure} or \\emph{linrelax} versions of the algorithm\\\n**A**: As we mentioned, the setting of \\emph{linrelax} is: at each iteration, it solves the linear relaxation of the BRO first to see if it can output the optimal solution added to the restricted game; if it cannot do that, it solves the original mixed-integer BRO and adds all feasible solutions for the BRO from the CPLEX solution pool to the original game.\n\nThat is, \\emph{linrelax} usually adds more strategies to the restricted game than \\emph{pure}. Consider the relaxed version DCG^linrelax_pure of DCG_pure. As we mentioned in Section 4, the relaxed version DCG^linrelax_pure of DCG_pure, in most games with relatively narrow game trees, outperforms DCG_pure because it could reduce the cost of calling the mixed-integer BRO. However, in games with relatively wide game trees, DCG_pure outperforms DCG^linrelax_pure because DCG^linrelax_pure transforms too many coordinated strategies into the TB-DAG form, which incurs a very high cost in games with relatively wide game trees.\n\n**Comment**: About originality.\\\n**A**: Our DCG does not just directly apply CG to the TB-DAG. Our work provides the first efficient TB-DAG CG algorithm, which includes a novel CG algorithm framework and solves many games that were previously unsolvable. Our DCG algorithm computes a pure coordinated best response (i.e., a coordinated strategy represented by a joint normal-form strategy of the team) in the original game tree first and then transforms it into the TB-DAG form. Our DCG has an extra transformation step, which does not exist in previous CG algorithms. Our DCG significantly overcomes the limitation of previous CG/double oracle algorithms for a TMECor with a novel CG algorithm framework and a suitable best response oracle. More details on related work are shown in Appendix A.\n\nWe provide a solid technical contribution in providing a novel CG framework for TMECor computation. For example, we show that the transformation cost is only polynomial in the size of the original game tree, which makes it clear that the transformation cost is not overly expensive. We also show that our algorithm converges exponentially faster than the state-of-the-art CG algorithms.\n\n**Q**: in many occasions it is said that \"by exploiting the team\u2019s correlation property.. the BRO\".. This property is not clear to me, and I thnk it should be better specified in the text\\\n**A**: Thanks. We explicitly mentioned that the team\u2019s correlation property is the probability flow defined in Eq.(2) in the new version.\n\n**Q**: the BRO algorithm presented in Section 3.3 is not completely novel. A similar algorithm was provided in \"Subgame Solving in Adversarial Team Games\" by Zhang et al., with the similar purpose of providing a more sparse BR (in that case sparsity is useful for reaching fewer private states in the same public state). My suggestion is to add a short reference to such a similar method.\\\n**A**: Their technique is different from ours. In Appendix A.4 of the new version, we discussed the technique in \"Subgame Solving in Adversarial Team Games\" by Zhang et al.:\n\nZhang et al. (2022a) provided a subgame technique to solve ATGs and proposed using CG for sparse solutions in the subgame solving algorithm. That is, they compute a best response starting from each reachable belief in each public state. To keep the number of these reachable beliefs small, they create sparse blueprints in the subgame solving algorithm by using a CG algorithm because \u201cthe support size of the blueprint generated by a CG algorithm, scales linearly with the number of iterations, which, under reasonable time constraints, rarely exceeds the hundreds\u201d (Zhang et al., 2022a). Their sparse blueprint and our pure best response are both sparse solutions, but theirs is different from our suitable BRO:\n\n 1. The goals are different: Our goal is to reduce the cost of the transformation in our DCG, but their goal is to reduce the number of times that the BRO is called.\n\n 2. The sparsity concepts are different: Their sparse blueprint is about a small support size of the blueprint (a mixed strategy of the gadget game), but our pure best response is just about an action for each reachable state/belief.\n\n 3. The approaches are different: We propose a new suitable BRO, i.e., pure BRO, to improve our DCG, but they just directly use an existing CG algorithm for a sparse blueprint, i.e., they do not provide a new BRO algorithm."
