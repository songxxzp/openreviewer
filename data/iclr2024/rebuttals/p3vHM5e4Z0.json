                    "value": "1. I am puzzled by the design of using the target label as the sensitive attribute. I do not find any justification, either empirical or theoretical, other than claiming, in the introduction, that correctly classified samples would be over-represented and incorrectly classified samples would be under-represented. \n\nIf the target label can be used as a proxy of sensitive attributes, why would people still need sensitive attributes in fairness study at all? I find this is a very broad claim that should be heavily backed up by either strong empirical evidence or solid theoretical insights.\n\nIn addition, I can think of plenty of counter-examples to show it is not true. Consider the following tabular data with 5 samples:\n\n|           | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | $x_3$ | $x_4$ | $x_5$ |\n|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Y         | 0     | 1     | 1     | 0     | 1     |\n| $\\hat{Y}$ | 1     | 1     | 0     | 0     | 1     |\n| A         | 1     | 0     | 1     | 0     | 0     |\n\n\nIn this case, the incorrectly classified samples ($x_1$ and $x_3$) are not over-presented by the disadvantaged group ($A=0$); in fact, they have no disadvantaged samples at all. The correctly classified samples (the remaining) are not over-represented by the advantaged group ($A=1$); in fact, they have no advantaged samples at all.\n\nThe authors might argue this is a cherry-picked corner case and not what happens statistically. But then the point is to have more justification for this strong and general claim.\n\n\n2. The theoretical justification for using EDM seems to me a misunderstanding of Lamy et al. The assumption of Lamy et al. is not the Eq. (7), but rather replace the $X$ in Eq.(7) with $D$ where $D$ is the joint distribution $P(X, Y, A)$. This difference is vital because in this work, the reason why EDM can be justified is the MC assumption is only applied to feature $X$ and therefore you can only look at feature distance to perform hyper-parameter; and since it assumes has nothing to do with either label $Y$ or sensitive attribute $A$, the work can claim it requires no sensitive attribute labeling on the validation set.\n\nHowever, this is not the assumption in Lamy et al. If I am not mistaken, the theory would not hold if you simply ignore the MC relationship on $A$ and $Y$ in the assumption. I am happy to change my mind if the authors can point out if I am mistaken. But if not, this seems to be a misquote of the results in Lamy et al., and the consequent justification of EDM does not hold."
