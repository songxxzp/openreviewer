In the reverse process, a mask predictor is used to recover the 3D information of the noisy subgraph. Finally, the proposed diffusion model is validated using the QM9 conformation generation and quantum property prediction tasks."

Which neural network architectures are used?\n\nWeakness 2: The proposed method has only been validated on QM9, which encompasses four types of atoms. Given that the periodic table consists of 118 elements, the paper doesn't address the extent to which the model can generalize in real-world scenarios."

Given this large amount of diffusion steps, the alternating update scheme might work well. However, I am not sure if using more cost-effective sampling methods would still benefit from masked diffusion? \n- Taking masking into consideration makes the diffusion process more complicated by design. Therefore, one should show that these extra modeling complexity is worthwhile by showing more promising performance on various downstream applications. The marginal performance gain on the GEOM-QM9 dataset (not GEOM-Drugs) is not convincing enough."

Minor performance gain on GEOM-QM9 may not be that significant since the target molecules are small in general. That being said, MaskedDiff cannot outperform SOTA models while introducing extra complication during modeling.\n\n- Diffusion models are known for their slow sampling process. Here the large number of steps (i.e., 5000) would make the sampling process particularly inefficient. For instance, for protein conformation generation, the number of steps is typically 200 or 500. Upon reducing the number of diffusion steps, would the alternating update scheme still work? \n\n- Does other sampling techniques, e.g., probability flow ODE, work for the proposed method?\n\n- Incorporating a well-designed prior distribution could also reduce the challenging learning task, e.g., [EigenFold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02198). The model should be able to figure out the correlation between data dimensions during training. Would this be more effective and easier to learn than introducing masks for the diffusion process?\n\n- Minor: Conclusion, \"European space\", fix typo."

The authors think diffusing individual atoms in a molecule may constrain the capacity of the models, as the connections among these atoms can be important. However, the methods tend to be a mask to choose a subset of atoms, which can be anywhere of the original graph and disconnected at all. As a comparison, there exist a bunch of studies [1,2] that consider REAL subgraphs (like motifs, functional groups etc) in generation by leveraging domain knowledge. The motivation of these existing works is more convincing and valid. \n\n2. The title and scope of the paper are a little weird. The work is actually not regular 3D molecular representation learning, but for molecular generation and self-supervised based representation learning. I suggest the authors consider this in the revision.\n\n3. Experimental results on GEOM-QM9 are very marginal, especially on the COV-P and MAT-P metrics where GeoDiff is much better. I also have concerns about the experiment setting that both generation and representation learning are conducted. However, for each one, the setup (like datasets)  is not sufficient or the results are not strong enough compared to baseline methods. A better solution is to only study one problem (like generation) with sufficient and strong results. This is also related to the title and scope of this work.\n\n4. To me, the implementation of the training and sampling of diffusion models on a subset of a graph is not trivial, but there exist several studies for similar purposes, like [1,2,3]. The authors may want to clearly state the unique **technical** contribution compared with these studies.\n\n\n\n\nRef\n\n[1] Haitao Lin et al, Functional-Group-Based Diffusion for Pocket-Specific Molecule Generation and Elaboration, NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[2] Yangtian Zhang et al, DiffPack: A Torsional Diffusion Model for Autoregressive Protein Side-Chain Packing, NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[3] Lingkai Kong, Autoregressive Diffusion Model for Graph Generation, ICML 2023."
