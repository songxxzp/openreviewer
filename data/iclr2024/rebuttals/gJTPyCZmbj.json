The proposed architecture, PagFormer, preserves elliptical geometry information and promotes the aggregation of global information using PAGrid. The proposed method derives a segmentation map for the input data by slicing from intermediate feature maps generated by the backbone, which leads to an encoder-slicer design. The proposed method is novel, and it\u2019s an interesting paper."

The symmetry between accumulation and slicing in PAGrid allows us to transition from the classic encoder-decoder architecture to an encoder-slicer design, embodied in the PagFormer. Experiments have been conducted on three medical image segmentation datasets \u2014 ISIC2017, ISIC2018 datasets for skin lesions, and ACDC datasets for cardiac organs."

Firstly, the method appears to use a radially symmetric transformation rather than anything tailored to ellipses in general. Secondly, are all the objects in the MRI datasets well approximated as elliptical? (It would be good to show some illustrative examples with segmentations obtained).\n\nAn important step would seem to be object localization prior to segmentation, so as to establish the polar centre. This is mentioned in passing on p7 but the method for doing so is not mentioned until 4.2. I believe this should be described more completely, and earlier in the Methods section. In particular, is it a separately trained SwinUnet, how was it trained/validated, and wouldn\u2019t a \u201cfocus on identifying the centre of the left ventricle\u201d adversely affect results for the right ventrical and myocardium? (It didn\u2019t seem to in Table 2 which seems surprising perhaps).\n\nOn p2 it is claimed that PagFormer \u201cexhibits faster convergence\u201d. I could not find any evidence in the results to support the statement about fast convergence, so this claim should be removed or the evidence included. \n\nOn p2 it is claimed that Pagformer \u201csurpasses the best-performing methods\u201d. The experiments as reported made me question this claim. \nFirstly, Section 4.4 and Fig. 5 describe the effect of changing two free parameters of the method, namely the scale factor and the number of intermediate features maps. The results reported in Table 2 comparing with other methods appear to be those obtained when these free parameters are set to values that result in the best Dice scores. My concern is that these parameters have in effect been tuned based on test set results. If this is the case then the experiment needs to be redone using validation datasets for parameter tuning.\nSecondly, the results in Table 2 show small improvements of typically less than 1% Dice score. Given that there are only 20 test cases, I wonder if this is statistically significant. It would be good to indicate some measure of variance in the results, e.g. bootstrap confidence intervals. \n\nFor reproducibility, can the authors provide their implementation, and the various hyperparameter settings used with the implementations of the competing methods (e.g. a github link)?\n\nThe cite style is used incorrectly throughout. Equations should be referred to with number in parentheses, e.g. \u201cEquation (2)\u201d rather than \u201cequation 2\u201d. The paper needs a proofread for grammar and typos.  Some Figures should be moved closer to where they are first mentioned in the text."
