                    "value": "This paper proposes a new method to address collider bias in causal effect estimation. The main idea is to model the collider bias as a out-of-distribution estimation problem. The algorithm uses two generators for generating the observational data and the selection indicator ($S=0,1$), and correspondingly two discriminators to discern the generated data as coming from $S=1$ or $S=0$. The generators and discriminators are adversarially trained using standard methods such as GAN. Experiments are conducted on synthetic datasets and semi-synthetic datasets with artificially induced collider bias."

The heuristic generator/discriminator approach does not allow the derivation of identifiability results, meaning that there is no guarantee the estimated treatment effets will be unbiased even if there are abundance of samples and appropriate assumptions.\n3. The proposed approach is only applicable with a binary collider variable."

                    "value": "1. How is the CATE estimations evaluated on Twins dataset? The Twins dataset is usually used only for evaluating ATE estimations as there is no ground truth counterfactual outcomes.\n2. Have the authors compared with more recently proposed CATE/ATE estimators? For example TEDVAE [1], DR-CFR [2]. As the currently compared methods are mainly not designed for collider and are a bit outdated, comparing with more recent methods can further demonstrate if the proposed approach is effective. As we are now at ICLR 2024, it seems insufficient to have most of the baselines proposed in 2016/2017.\n3. Also is there any reason for selecting the datasets used in the manuscript? IHDP itself is a semi-synthetic dataset with only one data generation process, which only covers rather limited real-world scenarios. Twins is commonly used for ATE estimation instead of CATE estimation. Datasets with more comprehensive DGPs would be desirable, such as ACIC2016.\n\n[1] Treatment effect estimation with disentangled latent factors.

                        "value": "**Response to Weakness 1**\n\nThank you for your comment. However, We have to emphasize our problem formulation that, to the best of our knowledge, there are no CATE estimation datasets under collider bias, so **we choose the two datasets following previous works [1,2,3] and introduce collider bias into them.** In this way, we can evaluate the performance of these estimators under collider bias. Also, as the exsiting works on collider bias mostly need additional prior knowledge that are not satisfied in these datasets, we choose baselines for slightly different tasks, i.e., CATE estimation under confounding bias and sample selection bias caused by $X$ and $T$. \n\n**Response to Weakness 2**\n\nThank you for raising the issue. However, our motivation is to recover the target population from the collider biased observational data with the help of a representive experimental dataset without collider bias. GAN models is just a way to implement the generation process of the missing $S$ labels in $D_{exp}$ and missing $S=0$ samples in $D_{obs}$. **As long as the generative models are well trained, the $S=0$ samples can be learned well with the information of the target population contained in $D_{exp}$.** \n\n**Response to Weakness 3**\n\nThank you for the comment. However, we have to emphasize that the definition of $S$ is that, the collected observational data is from $S=1$ and the unobserved data is $S=0$. By the definition, **we believe $S$ can only be binary since it is just an indicator of whether a unit is selected into the observed sample**. Therefore, such binary setting is reasonable common in real-world scenarios. \n\n**Response to Question 1**\n\nThe Twins dataset is used in previous CATE estimation works [2,3] because **the factual outcomes of the lighter/heavier twin are regarded as the counterfactual outcomes of the heavier/lighter twin.** Therefore, **we can calculate the ground truth CATE** by using the outcome of the heavier twin minus the outcome of the lighter twin.\n\n**Response to Question 2**\n\nWe appreciate your valuable advice and added more CATE estimation baselines [4,5] as you suggested, and the results are as below. \n\n| Dataset | DRCFR [4] | TEDVAE [5] | DCGM+BNN  |  DCGM+TARNet  |  DCGM+CFR  | \n|:---------| :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | :---------: | \nSynthetic data $S=1$  | 2.141$\\pm$0.203 | 4.014$\\pm$0.148 | 0.898$\\pm$0.028 | **0.826$\\pm$0.079** | 0.933$\\pm$0.053 |\nSynthetic data $S=0$ | 2.783$\\pm$0.384 |  5.397$\\pm$0.220 | 1.123$\\pm$0.036 | **1.022$\\pm$0.145** | 1.185$\\pm$0.098 | \nIHDP $S=1$ | 2.267$\\pm$0.339 | 4.143$\\pm$0.022 | **0.910$\\pm$0.186** | 1.083$\\pm$0.063 | 1.086$\\pm$0.224 | \nIHDP $S=0$| 2.413$\\pm$0.370 | 4.154$\\pm$0.037 | **0.897$\\pm$0.199** | 1.064$\\pm$0.101 | 1.070$\\pm$0.202 | \nTwins $S=1$  | 0.388$\\pm$0.028 | 0.323$\\pm$0.013 | **0.310$\\pm$0.008** | 0.315$\\pm$0.021 | 0.321$\\pm$0.021 | \nTwins $S=0$    | 0.396$\\pm$0.033 | 0.337$\\pm$0.011 | **0.308$\\pm$0.014** | 0.308$\\pm$0.015 | 0.311$\\pm$0.009 | \n|||||\n\nWe report the mean $\\pm$ std of $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{PEHE}}$. The experimental results show that our method (DCGM+existing CATE estimators) outperforms recent baseline methods on CATE estimation under collider bias.\n\n**Response to Question 3**\n\nThank you for the comment. As stated in **Response to Weakness 1** and **Response to Question 1**, we choose the IHDP and Twins datasets as we follow previous CATE estimation works [1,2,3]. We also adopt your advice and conduct additional experiments on ACIC 2016. Due to time limitation, only some of the results have been obtained, but based on the current results, our method still achieves an improvement in performance over baselines on ACIC 2016. Further results will be updated in time.\n\nWe hope the above answers can solve your problems. Thank you again for your comments and suggestions. Best wishes!\n\n[1] Shalit, U., et al. (2017).

The authors assume that a small-scale experimental dataset without collider bias is available and formulate collider bias as an OOD problem, considering the biased observational data is from a $S=1$ labeled domain and the unbiased experimental data is from the true distribution, but the $S$ labels are missing. They propose a novel method, DCGM, that utilizes generative models to generate the missing $S$ labels of the experimental dataset and the missing $S=0$ samples of the observational dataset. With the generated samples, existing CATE estimation methods can be applied even under collider bias."

Collider bias is always one of the significant challenges of causal effect estimation but was ignored in most previous works.\n\n2. The problem formulation that considers collider bias as an OOD problem is novel. The authors rethink collider bias from an OOD perspective, which is indeed a novel idea. In such a formulation, the proposed method using generative models to generate missing parts of each dataset is reasonable.\n \n3. The ablation studies are sufficient. The authors make several ablation studies, including comparing the results using different datasets with the same CATE estimator, comparing the results with different sample sizes of the experimental dataset, and comparing the results with or without specific modules in DCGM.\n\n4. To address collider bias, the authors assume that a small-scale experimental dataset without collider bias is available, which can be easily obtained by conducting experiments on the target population and seems a common assumption in data fusion works. The assumptions made in the paper seem reasonable to me and are impractical in real applications.\n\nThe paper is well-organized and easy to follow. The studied problem, collider bias, is interesting and challenging. The authors propose a novel formulation of collider bias as an OOD problem and propose a method to generate unbiased samples using generative models with the help of an experimental dataset without collider bias. The assumptions and methods are clearly stated and reasonable, and the experimental settings and results are detailed. One major concern is the difficulty in the GAN-based model training."

In fact external validity is arguably the biggest drawback of the experimental data, as the factors that influence both selection into the experiment (S=1) and modify the treatment effect lead to a difference in the average causal effects between the experimental population and a target populations.\n\nIn healthcare, for instance, people who are eligible AND join the trials (i.e. the experimental data in your case) are nothing near representative of the entire population. Therefore, while it is common practice to compare experimental and observational data or attempt to combine them, this is only possible, without further assumptions, to the extent of \"overlap\" between the entire population (as captured by the observational data) and the experimental population.  See some references for the generalizability of experiments problem in various domains:\n\n\"External validity of randomised controlled trials:\u201cto whom do the results of this trial apply?\u201d Rothwell et al., The Lancet, 2005.\n\"The generalizability of survey experiments,\" Mullinick et al., Journal of Experimental Political Science, 2015\n\"Generalizing causal inferences from individuals in randomized trials to all trial\u2010eligible individuals,\" Dahabreh et al., Biometrics. , 2019\n\nFurthermore, in Section 3.2 the authors state: \n\n\"We notice that the non-random sample selection caused by collider bias mainly results in the S = 0 data, i.e., the unselected data, completely missing in $D_{\\mathrm{obs}}$; And the critical problem in $D_{\\mathrm{exp}}$ is that the selection indicators are unknown.\"\n\nIt should be cited/noted where did they \"notice\" that? I do not see how, in real-world, the experimental data is never observed in the observational data. That would indicate zero overlap between studies which essentially makes any sort of joint inference infeasible. Also why the selection indicators are unknown in $D_{\\mathrm{exp}}$? Isnt it by definition $S=1$? And if experimental data is never selected as mentioned before, why would we expect the generator to ever generate S=0? I think what makes the algorithm work in experiments is the limited implicit overlap between the experimental and observational datasets that is also implied in the design of the generators, which does not seem to be inline with the verbal arguments/assumptions. \n\nThe assumptions as t how the covariate distributions in the experimental and observational distributions differ, with explicit reference to the role of selection/collider bias, should be made more clear, while staying grounded (i.e., the experimental data does not represent the entire population.)"

Responses to some of your questions follow.\n\n**Response to Weaknesses**\n\nWe agree that in some scenarios, experimental data may not be representive for the target population, and the proposed method is not applicable. However, **we think there are also many scenarios that the experimental population is the same as the target population, and such experimental design is feasible.** For example, when studying the effect of pricing on restaurant evaluation on the online ordering platform, only those who extremely like the restaurant's dishes or have a lot of complaints will take the time to evaluate the restaurant on the platform, which is the observation data. However, the target population is actually all users who use the platform, which leads to selection bias. The platform can randomly select a small number of users from among all users, and encourage them to evaluate the restaurant by discounts or coupons, which is the experimental data that can represent the target population.\n\nWe have to emphasize our problem formulation that throughout the paper, **we use $S=1$ to denote whether a unit is selected into the observational data**, which is the observational population. The experimental data is from another population that we assume is the same as the target population. Therefore, **units in the experimental data are not all from the $S=1$ distribution** (the observational population).\n\nWe hope the above answers can solve your problems.

It utilizes both observational and experimental data to generate missing S = 0 samples for the observational dataset, generate missing S labels for the experimental dataset, and align the distribution of the generated S = 0 samples with the observational dataset. DCGM comprises two generators and two discriminators. The generators generate missing data and labels, while the discriminators distinguish between observational and generated data. By optimizing the generators with the discriminators, DCGM effectively generates missing data while preserving the original data distribution."

The concern is that they cannot be the same since they are sampled from two different causal graphs, i.e., there is an edge X->T for D_obs while this edge doesn't exist in D_exp.\n\nI believe that both D_obs and D_exp should be generated with the same causal graph. In D_obs, only samples with S=1 are observed. In D_exp, all the records for both S=1 and S=0 are observed except that the label S for all records are unknown. This is why D_obs and D_exp can be aligned."
