This is a module that no one has ever seen, but can you think of such a method?\" First of all, as far as we know, previous GNN methods have never used multiplex relationships to construct graphs. At the same time, considering the particularity of this field, that is, the correlation of intestinal microorganisms is complicated and difficult to obtain, even multi-graphs cannot guarantee the accuracy of extraction. property, so we built Shuffled-Graph for adversarial training. At the same time, we supplemented ablation studies and tried it on Cirrhosis and T2D data sets. We found that if this method is not used, accuracy and auc metrics will drop by 2 ~6 percentage points, specific experimental data will be supplemented in the paper. In addition, \u201cThe work may not related to ICLR community\u201d, in fact, the first topic in ICLR\u2019s call for papers is \u201cunsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning\u201d. Finally, \"The baselines are old, and the code/dataset are not available.\", you may not have read the full text carefully. First of all, there is very little related work in this field, and it is also one of the bottlenecks. Our method is the first time to apply GNN to Methods in this field, so previous work has never used GNN to solve this problem, and our supporting material contains the complete code, which is inconsistent with what you said."

In UMMAN, GCN is utilized within each multi-graph to generate node embeddings and a novel readout function NFGI is proposed to generate the graph embedding corresponds to the multi-graph, then the attention mechanism is applied among multi-graphs.

Experimental results demonstrate that UMMAN can beat previous machine learning models in the field, making it a pertinent and valuable research topic. \n\nI would recommend the authors to add more discussion of the recent successes of GNNs in the context of bioinformatics in the introduction section to improve the manuscript.\n\n\n[1] Wang, J.; Liu, X.; Shen, S.; Deng, L.; Liu, H.

Since the sum of node embeddings is a widely used graph-level readout function, both the node level stage/descriptor (NLD) and graph level stage/descriptor (GLD) are used to summarize extracted node embeddings to a graph-level vectorial representation. \n\n3. The experiment section is not very sound. Recent SOTA (state-of-the-art) expressive GNN baselines are not included. Since the gut microbiota disease prediction is studied as a graph prediction task, these powerful GNN baselines are necessary.\n\n4. The paper concludes that the proposed UMMAN is stable.

Nodes in a graph can be randomly permuted, thus these there is no fixed order of nodes in a graph. Then what is the meanings of 'position of edges' and 'disrupt the nodes' in the sentence 'we design the adversarial control group, i.e., keep the position of the edges unchanged, randomly disrupt the nodes to train part of the discriminator'? Does that mean we keep the adjacency matrix yet permute the node order?"

Our method is the first to apply GNN to this field, so previous work has never used GNN to solve this problem. In view of this, we used GraphSAGE as a control experiment in the comparison experiment in the original paper, as shown in table1 . In the past two days, we have also added GAT experiments, and the results are similar to the GraphSAGE in the table. The specific data will also be displayed in the final paper. In addition, previous methods to extract the global features of a graph usually use the average of all nodes or global pooling, but the method is simple and the effect is not ideal. In order to verify the stability of the NFGI module, we conducted experiments on the value of K and found that the model with K ranging from 10 to 20 is generally more stable. Thank you again for your suggestions for improving the details of the paper. We will continue to revise and polish it."

In light of this challenge, the authors propose a method UMMAN which combines graph neural network to help learn the association between gut microbes and hosts.\n\nOriginal-Graphs, are constructed by using multiple relation-types, and then utilized to update the embedding of nodes through Graph Convolutional Networks. Attention mechanism is also introduced to update the embeddings of the corresponding nodes of the Multi-Graphs.\n\nThen the relationship among nodes of the Original-Graph is destroyed to get the corresponding Shuffled-Graph, which will be used for adversarial learning to obtain the correlation among nodes more reliably. The authors design the adversarial control group, i.e., keep the position of the edges unchanged, and randomly disrupt the nodes to train part of the discriminator at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the authors introduce the Node Feature Global Integration (NFGI) to describe a more comprehensive embedding of the graph with node-level stage and graph-level stage."

The motivation for applying GNN needs to be clearly explained i.e. why the columns in the tabular dataset are transformed into the nodes on a graph? Specifically, it is not very clear why some microbes are considered to be more correlated with each other and that they should be connected by an edge on a graph. The paper only provides a simple claim that two nodes are considered to be connected if the distance between their embeddings is below a variable threshold. It would be better if the authors could provide more details to illustrate the motivation. Moreover, as introducing graph machine learning to the field is one of the main contributions, it would be better if the authors could provide more details and instructions on the embedding process. For example, what are the features taken into consideration, the abundance level, the microbes' class, or anything else?\n\n3. The motivations of the proposed method (especially for Shffuled-Graph and NFGI) need to be clearly and explicitly explained. For example, it is not well motivated why we need to perturb the original graph by exchanging nodes.\n\nFor the claim that \u2018basic CNNs can't beat the traditional machine learning algorithm in this case (OTU datasets that are extended to table types) because the basic CNN\u2019s kernel cannot learn arbitrary transformed features, which is not suitable for OTU datasets,\u2019 it would be better for the authors to provide more details about the logic chain and explain what is meant by \"arbitrary transformed features\" in the context of OTU datasets.\nSimilarly, it would be better to tell more about why exchanging the column order in the tabular dataset will not affect the final result.In the introduction, it is mentioned that 'The exchange of rows and columns of the datasets do not affect the results of pattern recognition.'The authors should explain why this property is not desired i.e., why the authors desire to affect the results of pattern recognition by exchanging the rows and columns of the datasets and how it motivated them to propose their method.\n\nFor the proposed Shuffled-Graph, the motivation should also be explicitly illustrated. E.g., why some microbes are considered to be more correlated with each other, and what is the benefit of perturbing this kind of correlation? Why the Shuffled-Graph generated by breaking the correlation among nodes can be used as the negative adversarial control group, and why does such an adversarial learning method work?  It would be better for the authors to add proper references or experiments to support the claim that such perturbation should work.\nMoreover, for NFGI, why such a component is desired, and why do the authors design such a proposed graph-level stage instead of other graph-level operations such as pooling?\n\n4. It would be better if the authors could provide more details of the proposed methods, especially those of core contributions. E.g., how the K bins are chosen and decided for the GLD in NFGI.\n\n5. What is the 'true embedding', and how can it 'includes the complex and implicit relationship between gut microbes and hosts'?"

The motivations of any proposed method should be clearly and explicitly explained instead of just telling the reader how or what to do with the proposed method. Even some toy examples can provide a more comprehensive introduction for readers.\n\n3. Some notations appear in the equations for the first time and are not mentioned in the text. It would be better if the authors could align them with the text, e.g., H(which should align with \u2018global embedding obtained by NFGI\u2019) in eq11 and P(which should align with \u2018global embedding matrix of real graph\u2019) in eq12."

As you said, we should introduce the form of tabular data and the shortcomings of basic CNNs in more detail in the paper, and will continue to supplement the paper in these aspects. However, \"technical contribution is a bit marginal\" may not be very reasonable, because as Amazon chief scientist Li Mu said: \"A good paper is not about appearing modules that no one has seen before, but about such methods. Can you think of it?\" First of all, as far as we know, previous GNN methods have never used multiplex relationships to construct graphs. At the same time, considering the particularity of this field, that is, the correlation of intestinal microorganisms is complicated and difficult to obtain, even multi-graphs cannot guarantee the accuracy of extraction. property, so we built Shuffled-Graph for adversarial training. At the same time, we supplemented ablation studies and tried it on Cirrhosis and T2D data sets. We found that if this method is not used, accuracy and auc metrics will drop by 2 ~6 percentage points, specific experimental data will be supplemented in the paper."

This is also one of the biggest pain points in this field, so we thought of another way. , that is, constructing Shuffled-Graph.
