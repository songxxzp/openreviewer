It is not clear what kind of randomization is used in the experiment, and whether different randomization strategies will lead to different performances. \n\n- The paper presents a bi-level pruning method (i.e., optimizing one variable while fixing another one). How do you guarantee the convergence theoretically. Again, since the mask is randomly initialized, will different randomization lead to different convergences? Noted that different randomization could also impact the objective function (leading to different landscapes), thus, both theoretical and experimental studies regarding the issue of convergence should be conducted. \n\n- Based on the results in Fig. 3 and 4, the improvement seems to be very marginal. It is not clear to me whether the improvement is significant.\n\n- The adopted datasets and models for evaluation seem to be toy to me, perhaps more realistic dataset (e.g., healthcare) and more advanced model should be evaluated. \n\n- The motivation of using conves relaxation in 4.3 is not clear to me. Based on the submission, it seems the advantage of using convex relaxation is to let the fairness constraint convex and differentiable, but noted that our deep neural network is non-convex in nature (e.g., ReLU, maxpooling, etc.), the argument above is not convincing to me."

We appreciate these valuable comments and will integrate them further to improve the manuscript. Below, we address each of the points raised in the reviews.\n\n- W1: In our experiments, we utilized two methods for initialization. The first method sets the initial values to the pre-trained weights. The second method employs Kaiming Initialization [1]. We observed that both methods yield similar performance, indicating that different initialization approaches do not significantly impact the final results. We plan to include a more detailed discussion regarding this observation in the experimental section of our paper. \n- W2: This work highlights a critical social issue in pruning and offers an efficient and effective solution. The theoretical proof will be the focus of our future research efforts.\n- W3: We argue that the improvement is **not marginal**. The experimental results show substantial improvement. For instance, as illustrated in Fig. 4, on the Celeba dataset with 'Blond_Hair' as the target attribute and 'Male' as the sensitive attribute, our approach surpasses baseline models by achieving **6% higher accuracy** and **reducing bias by 300% at 80% sparsity**. This indicates that our coupling method not only enhances accuracy but also significantly improves fairness. Moreover, our proposed method exceeds the performance of the best baseline methods while also substantially reducing training costs. Specifically, it **saves 94.22% and 94.05%** of training iterations on the LFW and Celeba datasets, respectively.\n- W4: In our study, we deliberately selected smaller models to distinctly showcase the effectiveness and equity of the proposed pruning method. This approach results in a pruned model with reduced parameters while maintaining performance levels that are comparable to larger models. Regarding datasets, we adhered to the standard configurations commonly employed in related research, e.g., [1].\n- W5: While it is indeed true that deep neural networks are inherently non-convex, the application of convex relaxation in our context serves a specific and strategic purpose. The convex relaxation simplifies these constraints, making them more tractable within the optimization process. In addition, convex relaxation effectively reduces estimation errors between the actual non-differentiable functions and their relaxed counterparts [2]. This approach simplifies the tuning process and facilitates a balanced trade-off between performance and fairness. We will add experiments with non-convex surrogates in the next version.\n\n[1] Tang, Pengwei, et al. \"Fair Scratch Tickets: Finding Fair Sparse Networks Without Weight Training.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023.\n\n[2] Yao, Wei, et al. \"Understanding Fairness Surrogate Functions in Algorithmic Fairness.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.11211 (2023)."

While [a] is cited in the manuscript, it is not explicitly called out that they also use a very similar bi-level optimization framework - which looks misleading.\n\nW2. Definition 2 (Compressed Model Performance Degradation) and Definition 3 (Performance Degradation Fariness) seems unnecessary, since the authors essentially use only the fairness perfromance metric (definition 1) in practice when pruning the model.\n\nW3. Experiments are limited across dimensions such as datasets, models. More datasets (including larger ones) should be included such as in [b]. Larger models such as ResNets should also be included in the study.\n\nW4. Stronger baselines need to be used. At the moment, none of the baselines used optimize for fairness. However, there are other works such as [b] that optimize for fairness and should be used as a baseline to show the benefit of bi-level optimization over existing pruning approaches.\n\n\nOverall, I feel that the paper is still incomplete and is not yet ready for publishing. Moreover, I observe limited novelty in this work due to lack of difference from [a]'s pruning objective (Equation 1). Instead of the regulariser, the authors have replaced it with equation 8 of the manuscript which is directly bought in from [c].\n\n\n[a] Advancing Model Pruning via Bi-level Optimization.

We appreciate these valuable comments and will integrate them further to improve the manuscript. Below, we address each of the points raised in the reviews.\n\n- W1: This work primarily concentrates on **fairness in network pruning**, and our key contribution is an efficient and equitable pruning strategy. While study [a] utilizes first-order derivatives to calculate the Implicit Gradient (IG) for bi-level optimization, thus laying a solid foundation for network pruning, our research explores a less examined societal dimension of this domain. We introduce a constrained bi-level optimization problem and propose an innovative approach to network pruning that integrates fairness considerations, distinguishing our work from existing methodologies.\n- W2: We use Definition 2 in the experiment 5.3. Although we do not use Definition 3 in the evaluation section, it is useful to examine bias in terms of model pruning in other cases. We will integrate more evaluation perspectives in the next version.\n- W3: In our study, we deliberately selected smaller models to distinctly showcase the effectiveness and equity of the proposed pruning method. This approach results in a pruned model with reduced parameters while maintaining performance levels that are comparable to larger models. Regarding datasets, we adhered to the standard configurations commonly employed in related research, e.g., [1]. We will continuously seek larger datasets for fairness and computer vision.\n- W4: In Section 5.3, we outline the design of our baseline methods, integrating a two-stage fair training and pruning strategy. This approach sequentially combines model pruning and fair training, with a distinct contrast to our proposed single-run method. Whereas FairGRAPE is focused on minimizing the variance in performance disparities, our method is specifically aimed at reducing the relative disparities among various subgroups. Thus, we didn't include FairGRAPE in the comparison.\n\n- Q1: We follow the surrogate functions in [1], and in the experiment, we use the logistic surrogate function.\n- Q2: We follow the common practice of selecting m. In particular, in each iteration, we sort $m$, and assign top-$k$ elements to 1, and the rest of the mask to 0, where $k$ is a predefined density level.\n\n[1] Bartlett, Peter L., Michael I.

We appreciate these valuable comments and will integrate them further to improve the manuscript. Below, we address each of the points raised in the reviews.\n\n- W1: In our study, we deliberately selected smaller models to distinctly showcase the effectiveness and equity of the proposed pruning method. This approach results in a pruned model with reduced parameters while maintaining performance levels that are comparable to larger models. Regarding datasets, we adhered to the standard configurations commonly employed in related research, e.g., [1]\n- W2: As highlighted in section 4.2, the complexity of bi-level optimization problems increases significantly with additional constraints. This complexity is particularly evident in our methods, where constraints encompass both upper and lower-level variables, making the problem more challenging to solve. Addressing the theoretical proof of our approach remains an area for future investigation. We plan to concentrate our future research efforts on this theoretical aspect. In this paper, we have brought attention to an important ethical issue in pruning, and have proposed a potential solution for it.\n\n[1] Tang, Pengwei, et al. \"Fair Scratch Tickets: Finding Fair Sparse Networks Without Weight Training.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023."
