                    "value": "This paper's work arises from the idea that a good proxy for class labels in unconditional image generation is to identify the modes of the latent space of a pretrained generator. Given the assumption that the data generation probability concentrates on a set of sub-manifolds and the generator assigns a non-zero probability to space in between manifolds, the authors propose an unsupervised method to identify and learn to sample latent modes that correspond 1-to-1 to data classes."

Real-world images more sophisticated than CelebA + Flowers102 dataset often introduce complexities not found in simpler or synthetic datasets, and such a comparison would help assess the method's practical applicability.\n- The paper misses an opportunity to enhance its credibility by not incorporating the latest GAN architectures like StyleGAN. Analyzing clustering in the W space of StyleGAN could yield valuable insights and broaden the scope of the paper.\n- Another limitation of the study is the absence of a dedicated image quality metric for evaluating the performance of image generation models. In particular, the inclusion of, e.g., inter-class or intra-class Frechet Inception Distance (FID) as a quantitative assessment would greatly enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation and comparison between different models.\n- The omission of larger-scale datasets, like ImageNet or similar, is a missed opportunity to assess the method's scalability on more complex, mode-populated latent manifolds. An in-depth analysis on larger datasets would provide valuable insights into the method's performance under different conditions.\n- While the parameter study is performed on small datasets, it is essential to expand this analysis to real-world datasets. A broader study would better reflect the method's adaptability to real-world scenarios and provide more comprehensive insights."

LASH first shatters the latent space: many samples from the prior are drawn, and those which correspond to low-probability images according to the generative model (as measured by the injective change-of-variable formula) are dropped. The remaining samples are then clustered through k-means, and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is fit to each cluster. To sample conditionally from a given cluster, LASH simply samples from the corresponding GMM and decodes using the pre-trained generator.\n\nOverall, I think the problem tackled in this paper is interesting, and certainly original, albeit not of immediate practicality. I also think the authors present a simple and sensible approach to tackle the problem, which seems to perform well on the evaluated metrics. That being said, I believe the paper needs a much more thorough empirical evaluation. I will increase my score if the authors adequately address weaknesses 4 and 5 outlined below."

The paper aims to have a fairly formal mathematical presentation (which in it of itself is actually a good thing), but omits some relevant discussions and uses extremely strong assumptions -- and it hides the strength of the assumptions. I'll detail what I mean below, but overall this should either be addressed more carefully, the assumptions should be relaxed to strengthen the theory, or the paper should simply not attempt to be so formal:\n\n(a) First, $p_G$ is not a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. This should be clarified, as it implies that $p_G(x)$ can be non-zero only when $x \\in \\mathbb{G}$.\n\n(b) I think assumption 2 is way too unrealistic. Because of (a), assumption 2 is implicitly assuming that the support of $p_x$ is completely contained in $\\mathbb{G}$.\n\n5. The experiments are hugely lacking:\n\n(a) There is no qualitative comparison between methods. It would be valuable to actually show conditional samples from LASH and from the baselines.\n\n(b) There is also no study of how LASH affects the overall quality of the generative model. I believe the authors show verify that LASH is not ruining the quality of generated samples. A way to do so would be as follows: sample unconditionally from LASH (by sampling a cluster with probability proportional to its size, sample from the corresponding GMM, and then apply the generator) and compute some metric of sample quality like FID. Then, compare this FID to that of the pre-trained GAN.\n\nFinally, some minor points:\n\n- Please update the bibliography file to cite published versions of papers whenever these exist. For example, Kingma & Welling's VAE paper is an ICLR 2014 paper, not an arxiv preprint; and ADAM is also an ICLR paper (these are the 2 examples that I noticed, but please go through all the citations).\n\n- The first sentence in the \"State-of-the-Art\" paragraph is not properly conjugated (\"existing work... have\"; make \"work\" plural, or use \"has\").\n\n- Missing period at the end of footnote 1.\n\n- Figure 1 would be clearer if the shattered samples on latent space were actually a subset of the samples shown on the right.\n\n- \"Contributions\" paragraph should be \"Contributions.\" for consistency with the rest of the paper.\n\n- Third paragraph of sec 2: should $q_z$ be $p_z$?\n\n- Assumption 1 ends abruptly and is incomplete.\n\n- I think the $\\in$ symbol in assumption 3 should be $\\subset$.\n\n- Please put algorithm 1 at the top of the page.\n\n- Please define $\\mathbb{J}$ in sec 3.2.\n\n- Section 5.1: \"jacobian\" -> \"Jacobian\", and \"diagonal of the diagonal\""

I think the study of LASH as $k$ is changed in sec 5.5 is interesting, but could also be expanded further. Intuitively, I'd imagine that when $k$ is small, the clusters correspond to very broad concepts on an image, whereas as it increases, they become increasingly specific.

                    "value": "I have several concerns regarding this submission, primarily related to the positioning of the paper, the methodology, and the experiments conducted.\n\n\n# Overstatemnt as Conditional Models\n\nIn the work, the authors frame the proposed method as turning unconitonal generators into *conditonal models*. However, this appears to be a significant over-statement. The proposed method can not align itself with any arbitrary user- or data-defined conditions. Instead, it identifies the sub-manifold already already in the latet space, which is an intrinsic structure therein. \n\nContrastingly, a large body of works, to name a few  [1,2,3] (cited by the authors) and [8,9,10] (missed by the authors), are demonstrated the capacity to handle arbitrarly definied condition, through the use of energe function from learned or pre-trained models. These methods are not restricted by the intrinsic structure of a specific latent space, and are thus much more powerful in applicaitons. By comparison, the scope of this work under review seems considerably narrower.\n\nI acknowledge the authors\u2019 clarification that their method in this paper does not compete directly with those that uses energe based methods/losses . However that should still leadto a position without the current over-statement.\n\n# Limited Contribution\n\nThe focus on conditions inherent in the latent structure seems to restrict the potential contributions of this paper. This limitation is twofold:\n\n- Firstly, as mentioned above, the proposed method does not accomodate arbitily defined conditions, limiting its application. Also, it limits itself to GAN/VAE istand of diffusion models where conditioning on energy function based loss is useful. \n\n- Secondly, considering related works involving finding latent structure, for example [5,6,7] which the authors already cite. The contribution may be limited and assessing it could be a challenge. This challenge is exacerbated by experimental concerns I raise below.\n\n# Insufficient Expriments\n\nSeveral issues in the experimental section hinders a substantianl emeprical assessment of this work in its current form:\n\n- The proposed metrics are highly taied to cluster assignments, which is more directly to the design of the proposed, clustering based method, rather than universally applicable metrics for evaluating latent structures. More conventional metrics like classification results (accuracy, precision-recall curves) and FID would be more appropriate here.\n\n- The paper lacks visual examples illustrating the conditions identifiedby the method, which prevents qualitative evaluation.\n\n- The paper lacks results from more established models, such as StyleGAN{,2,3}, BigGAN. Also, the omission of diffusion models hurts the relavece of this work, althoug that may be intentional."

In my opinion, it just samples some latent points with high probability density and perform clustering via k-means or GMM. Moreover, the density estimation method has been used in the previous work [1]. \n2.\tBesides, the motivation of performing clustering in the latent space is not clear. Obviously. There is no actual meaning of clustering labels and therefore it is not suitable to utilize them for conditional generations. \n3.\tA similar idea was proposed in [2] a long time ago. \n4.\tThe experiments cannot validate the contributions mentioned in Section 1 and do not present any generated image to show the actual performance of the algorithm. \n5.\tThere are some typos in Section 4. For example, the \u201cuser-provided reword function\u201d should be the \u201cuser-provided reward function.\u201d\n\n\n[1] Humayun A I, Balestriero R, Baraniuk R.
