                    "value": "The paper proposed a new process of routing in capsule neural networks (henceforth CapsNets) that incorporates orthogonalisation to prevent feature overlap, introduces a capsule relu with batchnorm, and pruning. The gist is to reduce the number of parameters and develop variations that are shallower and deeper. Obviously shallow and deeper in CapsNets shall not be conflated with Transformers (or even CNNs) as the number of parameters is few. Since Dynamic routing (about 8M parameters) most ConvNets flavours have been considerably smaller, while performing well across SmallNorb, SVHN, FashionMnist, Cifar 10, Affnist etc. \\\nThe authors have provided some appropriate references but have also missed some papers that are still SOTA, e.g. Introducing Routing Uncertainty in Capsule Networks (98.6% accuracy with 140K parameters and 97.8% with 60K). Also the authors mention Affnist but they never provided any results (as far as I can tell - appendix does not have them either). Overall I think this is a good paper and am not invested in SOTA performance as I think CapsNets have merits beyond what is attributed to them (largely because of how transformers scale compared to CapsNets)."

                    "value": "The paper offers a nice formulation of a non-iterative orthogonalised pruned variation of capsules that works well with a Relu+batchnorm activation function. None of the three components is novel in that regard, but one would argue what is novel in the 1000s of papers that come out based on transformers (off topic). The performance presented (although not SOTA on SmallNorb (see page 6 in that NeurIPS paper: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/47fd3c87f42f55d4b233417d49c34783-Paper.pdf), is reminiscent of an overall positive trajectory that is theoretically sound. For instance, in the pruning context, the holy grail is achieving sparsity (especially in a structured setting) without compromising performance.  \\\nTo be personally convinced I would like to see some performance in Affnist settings, although Smallnorb is a good proxy overall and plays on CapsNets strengths."

Correct me if I am wrong but as far as I am aware these two papers are still the SOTA on SmallNorb and FashionMnist (VB routing achieved 94.8% on Fashionmnist with 172K parameters compared with 94.6% and 574K parameters in this paper), and perhaps affnist and multimnist? Nevertheless, I think it mostly matters for the results presented in table 1, as well as affnist that is mentioned but never provided."

To highlight the effectiveness of sparse, the authors are suggested to show the robustness metrics (as in Table 5) at the same time.\n2.\tWith more params, OrthCaps-D performs worse than OrthCaps-S on MNIST. Is that means that the performance on MNIST is saturated? Besides, OrthCaps-D (simplified) shows comparable performance with OrthCaps-S and with similar params, what is the motivation to design OrthCaps-S?\n3.\tAs illustrated in the paper, reducing the inefficiencies and redundancy will help the network stacks deeper, the authors are suggested to show the results of a more deeper architectures (for e.g.  reaching the Param of resnet 18) with more competitive performance."

Why does preserving the direction of capsule vectors mitigate feature interference?\n1.5 What is the motivation of  Capsule ReLU? Why is that used with OrthCaps-D but not OrthCaps-S?\n\n2. Why is capsule ReLU designed so? What is the motivation for using BN on a scalar (||s_j||^2)? It is very unnatural, so I would expect a clear motivation.\n\nI rate a strong reject mostly because the writing quality of this paper makes it difficult for me to accurately understand the essence of the proposed method, thus preventing me from evaluating its technical correctness and significance.\n\nOf course, as I am not an expert in capsule networks, it may be due to my lack of relevant knowledge that I cannot understand this paper.
