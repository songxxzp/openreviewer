The reason the score did not achieve 8 is that there is still room for improvement in experiments and analysis. \n\n1. The three datasets, MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, used to construct the experimental scenarios, are somewhat simplistic. Moreover, certain experiments and metrics are only disclosed for one or two of these datasets.\n2. The disclosure of experimental hyperparameters appears to be incomplete. Algorithm hyperparameters, network hyperparameters, hyperparameters for comparison methods, random seeds, and other relevant details should be fully presented. Experimental results should include the mean and variance of metrics from multiple trials.\n3. The two types of distribution changes in the experimental setup are not intuitive, lacking visualization, making it difficult for readers to perceive the extent of label distribution shift in the experimental setup. It is also challenging to determine what the most extreme scenarios included in the experimental setup are like.\n4. The applicability of the algorithm should be thoroughly discussed. Considerations such as when the algorithm might fail, its compatibility with other algorithms and models, and its performance in extreme conditions (such as extreme imbalance or unseen categories) should be discussed.\n\nThe above points are just requirements for an 8-score paper. Of course, even if these issues are not addressed, I acknowledge that this paper is above the acceptance threshold."

However, due to time constraints, we did not obtain new results. But, we add MLLS, which is an advanced method for last two years, as a comparison method to illustrate ALS more effectively.\nFor the second weakness, we directly adopt the code provided by the authors of the compared methods. Since the comparison method can be embedded in our method, the network architecture and hyperparameters are set according to the compared methods. We illustrate it in the paper for a clear illustration. \nFor the third weakness, we use the parameter $\\alpha$ to determine the label distribution. We choose $\\alpha=1$ as the upper bound of the shift, because $\\alpha=0.5$ may cause some classes to have zero data, which will break the algorithm. \nFor the forth weakness, the new class can be seen as a special case of extreme imbalance. One of the directions for future research is how to correct the model in the case of extreme imbalance. This article focuses more on how to use the data in the target domain, and thus does not consider extreme imbalanced cases specially. \nFor the first question, we adopt micro-Fscore for multi-class classification."

This is one of the key point in the proposed method. However, how to calculate the sample weight is not clear: the different notions are mixed-use, i.e., \\pai\\^ k and \\pai\\_k, and the same sample weight is assigned to samples in the same class? In Eqn. (10) the sample weight \\pai\\_i^k is used, however, in the context, only \\pai\\^k is discussed.\n(2)\tThere exists some minor error, such as the \u201ci\u201d in Eqn.(7) is confusion with different range, and in Appendix, the No. of equation is wrongly used, for example, \u201cCombining Eq.(17) and Eq. (20), we have\u201d,\u201d Combining Eq. (22), Eq. (24), Eq. (25) and Eq. (26), we have\u201d. The method BBSE is wrongly written as BBLS in \"which outperforms both BBSL and RLLS across diverse datasets and.......\". In Table 1. the combination of BBSE or RLLS and ALS is wrongly written as BBSE-LSC or RLLS-LSC.\n(3)\tIn Appendix, the \u201ct(Y = y)\u201d is used in Eqn.(7), this maybe a mistake.\n(4) In the Introduction, MLLS is mentioned, which is one of the latest method for label shift.

However, we only select samples with the highest confidence that can maintain the label ratio in this paper, so it does not result in too much time cost.\nFor the first question, we revise this paper in the following two parts. (1) In view of the grammar and symbol usage problems of the article, we again checked and revised it to ensure that there were no symbol misuse and syntax error problems. (2) We propose a new method to extend ALS with MLLS, which is an advanced method for last two years, and call it MLLS-ALS.

Theoretically, the authors demonstrate the approach's sample complexity and generalization guarantees. Then, BBSE and RLLS with ALS are compared favorably in experiments to BBSE and RLLS without ALS, another approach CBST, and a model without any label shift technique applied."

                        "value": "Thank you for your comments. \nFor the first weakness, as the reviewers said, ALS can be viewed as an additional trick for improving performance on most label shift methods. Thus we propose a new method to extend ALS with MLLS, which is an advanced method for last two years, and call it MLLS-ALS. Then we compare MLLS-ALS with MLLS, and the experimental results in subsection A.3.4 of the supplementary material show that MLLS-ALS achieves good performance in most cases.\nFor the second weakness, the reason why we use BBSE and RLLS as basis methods is to fancy their nice theoretical properties, which can be combined with ALS to obtain Proposition 7. If the basis method, such as MLLS, has no theoretical guarantees, it is difficult for us to obtain the desired theoretical properties. While there are no theoretical guarantees for MLLS, experiments can be conducted to illustrate the performance of ALS. The experimental results is shown in subsection A.3.4 of the supplementary material.\nFor the third weakness, we illustrate the meaning of ALS in the part of Introduction, i.e., 'our approach, abbreviated as ALS, learns a self-trained intermediate distribution...'. We used 'ideal' earlier to better distinguish between the true and pseudo-label-guided intermediate distributions. Borrowing from the reviewer's suggestion, we drop the 'ideal' for clearer presentation. In view of the grammar problems of the article, we have checked and revised it again.\nFor the first question, we compare the proposed MLLS-ALS with MLLS in subsection A.3.4 of the supplementary material to show the effectiveness of ALS."

I appreciate your work to improve the writing and especially in adding the experiment with MLLS-ALS.\n\nI think it's extremely reasonable to do the theoretical analysis using BBSE/RLLS since they already have good theory. However, I don't think this is a good reason to focus your empirical analysis on ALS using these methods. Instead, I think the paper should present empirical analysis of BBSE/RLLS/MLLS equally so you can emphasize ALS works with a lot of different methods. \n\nI now see ALS stands for Alleviating Label Shift; you could maybe try bolding/italicizing this phrase so people don't miss it, but this is a minor detail. The latest paper draft's edits have begun to improve the writing and math notation clarity, but I think it still needs more of this.\n\nFor these reasons, I think ALS has promise but the paper could just use a little more time to develop. For these reasons I will maintain my rating of 3."
