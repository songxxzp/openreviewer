                    "value": "The focus of the present paper is on attractor networks, a special kind of recurrent neural network whose dynamics converge to a fixed point, or more generally towards a stable pattern within a fixed manifold. While attractor networks are prevalent tools in neurosciences and more generally in machine learning owing to their memory and computational properties, they suffer from instability upon changing one or several of their parameters, which impedes gradient-based learning in such models. The present paper proposes an existing theoretical framework to systematically address this problem (invariant continuous attractor manifold theory) and proposes a set of simple experiments to validate the relevance of this framework. More precisely:\n\n- The introduction introduces a simple class of RNNs (Eq. 1) of which two classes can be derived in dimension 2: the UBLA model and the BLA model. The UBLA model exhibits a half line in the positive quadrant of $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as a stable manifold (i.e. continuously made up of fixed points) while the BLA model has a bounded line in the same quadrant as a stable manifold. The stable manifold of the former can break upon changing the weights in some way, while the stable manifold of the latter model is more stable. This poses the question of how stable learning (in the sense of preserving the topology of these stable manifolds) can be achieved in these models.\n\n- Section 2.1 introduces Theorem 1, an existing theorem which, heuristically speaking, states that if the stable / invariant manifold of the model is initially bounded and smooth, then it may not change upon small perturbations. The slightly perturbed manifold is called a \"slow manifold\". In the light of this theorem, we may understand why UBLA (whose stable manifold is unbounded) is unstable upon weight nudging, while BLA is.\n\n- Section 2.2 discusses implications on ML, and in particular that models not satisfying Theorem 1 (e.g. UBLA) exhibit exploding gradients. For models satisfying Theorem 1 (e.g. BLA), it is suggested that loss gradients could act as \"restorative forces\" to counteract the deformation of the stable manifold. This idea is empirically investigated later in the paper.\n\n- Section 2.3 discusses implication on neurosciences.\n\n- Section 3.1 presents the first experiment which is the linear temporal integration task. In this setting, the RNN processes a sequence of pair of stochastic clicks and is learnt to predict the time-cumulated difference between the clicks. Therefore the RNNs under investigation operate in two dimensions and three kinds of RNNs are studied: the identity RNN (Id), and the UBLA and BLA model previously introduced. Fig. 3, along with the text, states the main findings. 1/ when deterministically perturbing a single entry of the recurrent weight matrix of these models, UBLA and Id can diverge (i.e. the loss diverges upon running the temporal dynamics) while BLA remains stable (B), 2/ when starting from the model optimum and adding a single noisy weight perturbation to the models, gradient descent maintains the model near optimum (E), yet often to a suboptimal solution (F), 3/ BLA exhibits some advantages in terms of stability, 4/ \"in practice, it is difficult to maintain any of the continuous attractors\".\n\n- Section 3.2 presents similar experiments but in polar coordinates, with the same integration task but on this circle. Two models are considered, one whose stable manifolds are the origin and the unit circle, another one where the stable manifold is boundary less. However, results aren't presented on this model.\n\n- The conclusion is somewhat negative : 1/ \"the homeostatic restoration of continuous attractor [through gradient signal] may be challenging\", 2/ \"further researcher on finding restorative learning for larger perturbations in the parameter space is needed\"."

Our responses to the raised points are the following:\n\n> The theoretical framework proposed, while enlightening the UBLA and BLA models, does not lead to a concrete prescription as to how to build RNNs that are robust to weight perturbations.\n\nThere is some literature on the necessary conditions for attractive and bounded solutions to exist, see for example Yi (2001). See conditions for a line attractors in ReLU RNNs in Yu (2009), one just needs to rotate these line attractors so that they become bounded. Furthermore, conditions of the equilibria in more generality (line and plane attractors) of the 3D RELU network are presented in Xiang (2021) and parameters for bounded plane attractors for 4D tanh networks are discussed in Yu (2023). These construction should lead to RNNs with continuous attractors that are robust to weight perturbations given our theory.\n\n\n> how do the findings extend to larger models?\n\nThe theory tells us that regardless of the dimensionality of the RNN, as long as they have bounded normally hyperbolic continuous attractors the only way to create exploding gradients is if there is a chaotic system in the neighborhood of the original.\nCurrently, all systems considered have a slow flow after perturbation, which can be maintained with the correct learning rate. If one would take non normally hyperbolic attractors, the exploding gradients would form an even bigger problem. For RNNs with a ReLU  activation function, all continuous attractors are normally hyperbolic however, whether they are bounded or not.\n\n>to have robust RNNs are to pick ones which have bounded and smooth stable manifolds\n\nThis indeed underlies the generality of the theory. \nHowever, it is not required that the invariant manifold be smooth.\nFurthermore, using backpropagated gradients would be one way to counteract noise, which is especially problematic for non-normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds.\n\n> The experimental setup may not be relevant to larger models, given that the RNN robustness is studied when the model is already initialized at its optimum, which may not be the case for a realistic task.\n\nWe agree that our theory only covers cases where there is a continuous attractor implemented in an RNN. However, our theory does apply to RNNs of all sizes, hence also for larger models. \nthese theoretical results nullify the concern of the fine tuning problem in neurosciences\nWe agree with the reviewer that this is too strong of a claim given our current understanding of continuous attractors and we have softened our language in the manuscript accordingly.\nHowever, we would still like to note that the BLA has the broadest range of learning rates that are optimal and far away from really badly exploding gradients.\nFurthermore, the somewhat negative results are specific for the backpropagated gradient that we consider here. It is not a general principle that homeostatic restoration of continuous attractors is challenging, but only for the gradient signal considered in the paper. In fact, a control mechanism could be theoretically devised that relies on finite control input for all bounded continuous attractors, while this is not guaranteed for unbounded continuous attractors.\n\n> initialization strategies for RNNs in ML\n\nFurther research needed to test efficiency of BLA as an initialization strategy. Our theory suggests that networks with bounded continuous attractors) will not exhibit exploding gradients under noisy conditions, while RNNs initialized with the identity matrix will. \n\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\n\n\nYi, Z., Tan, K.K. and Lee, T.H., 2003.

Our responses to the raised points are the following:\n\n> i. the lack of mathematically precise explanations\n\nWe have adjusted the language in Theorem 1 (Fenichel's Invariant Manifold Theorem) to make the statement mathematically mode precise. To comment on the complications of determining the extent of noise that a given system can handle, a lot more research is needed to develop a full account for what the maximal $\\epsilon$ (the timescale parameter) value is for which persistence holds. But in principle it can be calculated, see Chapter 6.5 in Wiggins (1994).\n If there are any particular parts of the manuscript that the reviewer  found imprecise, we would be happy to know so that we can improve the overall mathematical precision.\n\n> ii. the lack of guidance as to how to interpret the 2D results for RNN training in general\n\nNormal hyperbolic attractors are persistent in arbitrary dimensions. This is demonstrated for a higher dimensional example of the head direction network implementing a ring attractor. All perturbations in the vicinity of the original system lead to a bounded invariant manifold, for which we describe the Morse decomposition in terms of the fixed points and their connecting orbits. Saddle nodes are always connected to stable fixed points in the direction of their unstable manifold.\n\n> Does this mean that the attractors of the hidden states are never chaotic attractors?\n\nFor 1 and 2 dimensional continuous attractors, small enough perturbations never lead to chaotic attractors, because the perturbed invariant manifold needs to be homeomorphic to the original continuous attractor and there can be no chaos in dimensions 1 or 2 (see for example the Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem). For higher dimensional continuous attractors this is not guaranteed, however, the chaotic flow will be slow according to the theory.\n\n> While the authors mention that these theoretical insights can be used to guide RNN training dynamics away from problematic bifurcations, it is unclear how that can be accomplished in practice, in high-dimensions.\n\nNormal hyperbolic attractors will be persistent in arbitrary dimensions, even in PDEs. For ReLU RNNs, there is some literature on the necessary conditions for attractive and bounded solutions to exist, see for example Yi (2001). See conditions for a line attractors in linear threshold RNNs in Yu (2009), one just needs to rotate these line attractors so that they become bounded. Furthermore, conditions of the equilibria in more generality (line and plane attractors) of the 3D RELU network are presented in Xiang (2021) and parameters for bounded plane attractors for 4D tanh networks are discussed in Yu (2023). \n\nWe will include these in the manuscript. However, for RNNs with arbitrary activation functions, a general theory is still lacking.\n\n> When can RNN dynamics be decomposed into slow-fast systems for which we can apply Fenichel duality? \n\nFor continuous attractors this decomposition is always possible. We would kindly bring to the attention of the reviewer that Fenichel\u2019s Invariant Manifold Theorem should not to be confused with Fenchel\u2019s duality theorem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenchel%27s_duality_theorem).\nFor other systems, decomposability into fast and slow subsystems needs to be investigated on a case-by-case basis.\n\n> When does the input dynamics (discrete-time map) induce Fenichel-type attractors in the dynamics of the hidden state (may be the authors can expand a bit on their observations about the loss landscape near the normally hyperbolic fixed point).\n\nWe show some results of RNN trained on an integration task that show that bounded normally hyperbolic invariant sets (is this what the reviewer refers to as Fenichel-type attractors?) develop during learning and that even with (constant) input the system exhibits Fenichel-type attractor behavior, typically in the form of limit cycles and fixed points.

This stability ensures that, when a corrective learning signal is present, backpropagation will not result in exploding gradients over any duration. In contrast, unbounded line attractors can become divergent systems when subjected to specific perturbations, leading to exploding gradients. This observation also suggests that specific implementations of continuous attractors may have built-in homeostatic mechanisms that preserve the attractor's structure, making it suitable for the neural computations it is intended for."

                    "value": "1. First off, it's important to note that, as demonstrated in the study by Mikhaeil et al. (2022), when dealing with chaotic or unstable dynamics, gradients will always explode and **this issue cannot be solved by RNN architectural design or regularization and needs to be addressed in the training process**. So, the authors should consider this more precisely.\n\n2. The paper primarily focuses on a specific RNN variant, employing the ReLU activation function, 2-dimensional RNNs with specific parameter values outlined in equations (9) and (10). This specificity may limit the generalizability of its findings to higher dimensions, other architectural designs, and parameter configurations. In one particular parameter setting, the RNN exhibits 'well-behaved' dynamics, converging to a fixed point with bounded loss gradients. In such cases, established solutions (e.g., Hochreiter & Schmidhuber 1997; Schmidt et al., 2021) can be employed to prevent gradient vanishing. While this result is interesting, it's essential to recognize that it represents only one specific scenario and may not cover the broader spectrum of possibilities.\n\n3. Utilizing Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem, the authors established a sufficient condition to ensure that RNNs implementing continuous attractors remain immune to exploding gradients. However, pleae note that a ReLU RNN, discrete- or continuous-time, is a piesewise linear (PWL) dynamical system, a subclass of piesewise smooth (PWS) dynamical systems, that is smooth everywhere except on some boundaries separating regions of smooth behavior. These boundaries, called switching manifolds or borders, divide the phase space into countably many regions. Many existing theories of smooth DS do not extend to PWS systems. In PWS systems the interaction of invariant sets with switching manifolds often gives rise to bifurcations, known as discontinuity-induced bifurcations, which are not observed in smooth systems. Moreover, in the PWS setting, for bifurcations containing non-hyperbolic fixed points, similar slow (center) manifold approaches can be applied, but only to part of phase space. However, bifurcations involving switching manifolds cannot be examined in the same manner, as there is no slow (center) manifold. Consequently, the applicability of Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem to different parameter settings of the considered system (eq. (7)) may be limited or pose considerable challenges.\n\n4. Regarding the link between bifurcations and EVGP during training, it is essential to consider additional relevant literature. For instance, as demonstrated in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.17561.pdf) specific bifurcations in ReLU-based RNNs are always associated with EVGP during training."

                        "value": "We thank reviewer yzhP for the review and the valuable suggestions. Our responses to the raised points are the following:\n\n1. In this paper we focus on the properties of continuous attractors that might be necessary for some specific tasks, and are not concerned with learning chaotic dynamics.\n\tFurthermore, unstable dynamics won\u2019t be present in our proposed RNNs as we are concerned with bounded continuous attractors that will have a persistent attractive invariant manifold. We clarified this in the paper on page 3 at the beginning of Section 2.\n\n2. We agree that the paper only covers one specific scenario (that of bounded invariant manifolds in RNNs) and may not cover the broader spectrum of possibilities. However, note that our theory is applicable to all RNNs and biological recurrent networks that can realize such invariant manifold structures. We believe that it is this generality of the theory that makes it relevant to the broader theoretical neuroscience and machine learning communities.\n\n3. Smoothness of the system under consideration is indeed a valid worry in general. However, for continuous piecewise linear (PWL) dynamical systems for our purposes of stability of the persistent invariant manifold, the theory is applied (ReLU RNNs are continuous). If the critical manifold is globally stable then the system is forward invariant in a neighbourhood of the critical manifold, and Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem is applicable (Simons, 2018). We believe that the theory can be applied to PWL continuous systems with continuous attractors in high generality because of their global attraction property, see for example the analysis of the head direction model in Section 3.2. \nFor remarks on the application of the fast-slow theory to PWLs, see Theorem 19.3.3 in Kuehn (2015). And in practice we see that the continuous attractor persists as an invariant manifold, see the bifurcation analysis both on the bounded line attractor network and the head direction representation network. For Filippov systems the situation is different because they are not continuous. For fast-slow analysis of Filippov systems, see Cardin (2013), however, note that these are outside the scope of our investigation. We included a remark on the applicability of Fenichel\u2019s invariant manifold theorem to continuous piecewise linear (PWL) dynamical systems on page 4 in the second paragraph.\nThis means that even for PWL continuous dynamical systems, the normally hyperbolic invariant manifold that is the continuous attractor is going to persist. It will not maintain smoothness because $r<1$, but we don\u2019t think that causes an issue for the (biological) systems that implement continuous attractors. If it is important that the invariant manifold persists in a smooth way, namely that the perturbed invariant manifold is $C^r$ then other activation functions need to be used. \n\n\n\n\n4. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and will incorporate it in the text as one way of finding maximal epsilon bifurcation parameters around continuous attractors. \nOur theory shows that for 1 and 2 dimensional continuous attractors, there are no exploding gradients for small enough perturbations, even though bifurcations do occur. The only possibility is the creation of chaotic orbits, which could still cause a problem. This paper however is not considering bifurcations involving chaotic behavior, so we don\u2019t see the relevance of considering this part of the literature.  Note finally that while we acknowledge the relevance of this recent paper to our research, it was published after the submission of our manuscript.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nCardin, P., Da Silva, P., & Teixeira, M.

Allow us to elaborate on the theoretical progress we aim to contribute to the field. Our study focuses on a fundamental theoretical insight that transcends the immediate realm of practical applications. We establish that, under the condition of attractors being normally hyperbolic, they exhibit a robustness to small perturbations, thereby retaining their attractiveness as a set. This finding not only adds a valuable theoretical dimension to our understanding of machine learning but also has broader implications for the advancement of the field.\n\nIn essence, our work strives to unveil general principles that govern the stability of attractors, contributing to the foundational knowledge of machine learning dynamics. While we acknowledge that practical applications may not be readily implementable, we argue that the theoretical framework we propose lays the groundwork for future innovations and discoveries.\n\nWe invite the reviewer to consider the broader impact of our theoretical contributions, which extend beyond the confines of specific experiments. By elucidating the stability properties of attractors, our work opens avenues for further exploration and application in diverse contexts. We remain committed to advancing the field of machine learning and believe that our theoretical findings provide a solid foundation for future research endeavors.\n\nOur responses to the raised points are the following:\n\n> are the bounded attractors more likely to be learned from arbitrary initialisations\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that bounded attractors should be easier to learn, however, only if the network dynamics is already near the solution. From an arbitrary initialization, we find that various slow manifold solutions that approximate a continuous attractor can be reached. In our numerical experiments, when circular variables were trained, a ring-like structure often emerged. We added these results to the supplementary material in Supp. Sec. 12. \nWe furthermore present some preliminary results on training RNNs on the same integration task, but from arbitrary initialization for the parameters. In this case, we show that bounded attractors are more likely to be learned if the task duration is long enough. \n\n\n\n> What happens in complicated situations?\n\nWe will try to clarify what could happen in an example of a task that is more complicated. We will reflect on RNNs trained on multiple tasks, such as in Driscoll (2022). In this case, one would need to study how certain invariant manifolds used by one task are influenced by training the system on another. One could then another and then to compare different implementations of a line attractor (UBLA/BLA) while training the system on two different tasks, an integration task and a perceptual decision-making task for example.\n\nIn the supplementary, we now show some results on training RNNs on an angular velocity integration task (for which continuous,  circular variables need to be integrated and maintained by the network). In this case, the trained RNNs exhibit a ring-like structure. \n\nIf the reviewer had other complicated situations in mind, we would be happy to address what happens in them.\n\n> What does it mean for biological networks?\n\nAs suggested in the paper, structural constraints (such as Dale's law and mutual inhibition which are both satisfied for the bounded line attractor) could contribute to biasing learning towards bounded attractors.\n\n\n> Can any insights be made into the sorts of sequence tasks that machine learners care about?\n\nOur theory suggests that compact continuous attractors are more robust under noisy and continual learning. For high-dimensional RNN training for general tasks (e.g. sequential MNIST), as long as these involve the need to represent continuous variables, continuous attractors will be a natural solution, see for example Dehyadegary (2011)."
