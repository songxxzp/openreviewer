                    "value": "The authors propose an interesting way to do time series forecasting and classification with pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs). Whereas LLMs are designed to be used via prompts, the authors propose to find time series embeddings that are introduced in the model instead of finding suitable prompts. In this way, by considering an end-to-end approach, where the embeddings are adjusted according to the given dataset keeping the LLM weights frozen, the authors show that the proposed methodology does present a competitive performance. In particular, the larger the model, i.e. LLaMa-13B, the better the performance, potentially outperforming SOTA models like transformers. Finally, the authors present a brief analysis on the embeddings learn by the model, which suggests that these are mainly composed by adjectives/sentiments."

                "strengths": {
                    "value": "The authors motivate the proposed approach by clarifying that there are basically two ways to extend LLMs to time series: either by 1/creating a LM from a large enough time series corpus, which would imply an non-negligible amount of computational resources, or 2/ adjusting time series so that one can leverage available LLMs. Given that the later approach is more accessible to practitioners, the authors then start providing a way to embed time series to leverage existing LLMs for time series.\n\nThe strongest point of the paper is the notion of introducing time series embeddings to LLMs rather than finding the right prompt for it. Interestingly, the authors consider that by freezeing the weights of the LLM one can obtain embeddings that are leading to a competitive performance in terms of forecasting and classification. \n\nPerhaps the most interesting point would be to understand the kind of embeddings that are obtained from the proposed methodology."

                    "value": "1. Given that the proposed approach relies on contrastive learning, I would suggest the authors to provide a more self-contained and better written text when it comes to contrastive learning. Currently the paper assumes a non-trivial amount of familiarity to the topic and makes it difficult to follow. For instance, what does the following term mean: _jitter-and scale strategy_?\n\n2. There is no code included. This is relevant as I wonder if one can reproduce the experiments given the current writing quality of the paper.\n\n3. There are no evaluations for zero-shot evaluations. According to the motivation of the paper, it might be relevant as well to consider the case where the time series embedding is developed in a particular dataset, and then tested in another one. Although this might not be necessarily too far from the few-shot evaluation already presented.\n\n4. There is no analysis on time execution. The authors do not report how long it takes to obtain the time series embeddings. \n\n5. The results are presented in an aggregated way across datasets. It would be of interest for researchers and practitioners how the proposed approach performs per dataset."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. What is jitter-andscale strategy?\n\n2. can the authors please expand a bit on what the following line means? _In this work, we choose P representative text embedding tp as pivots/prototypes, and map TS embedding to them_\n\n3. typo: Figure 3.g: spesific \u2192 specific\n\n4. typo: Figure 2: Fine-turn \u2192 Fine-tune.\n\n5. it seems that a general trend is that the LLaMa-13B performs best. It I understand correctly, this is as well the largest pretrained model considered. Further, one can see that for GPT2, the larger the model, the better the performance. Do we know, or can we do a conjecture, on what is the limiting performance in terms of model size (number of parameters)?\n\n6. Why is LLM-QA not showing any variance? Or why is it depicted in this way? \n\n7. Why is one-fits-all not used in *all* forecasting experiments? If I understand correctly, one can use it for comparison.\n\n8. Why are not other models considered here? for instance DeepAR, MQCNN, Wavenet, NHiTS, NBeats, etc for these experiments? Even models like ARIMA, ETS, seasonal naive would be interesting to consider.\n\n9. From 3.d it seems that the prompt length should be restricted to not be particularly large, but suprisingly the smaller the number of parameters (GPT-117M) the better the performance. How does this fit with the previous observation that larger models perform better?\n\n10. On Embeddings (section 4.3): how does the embeddings change per model? For instance, what are the embeddings when using BERT-335M, GPT2-774M, etc?\n\n11. When it comes to forecasting, is the proposed approach a point-wise or a probabilistic forecaster?\n\n12. What is the performance if the LLM taken is the one of the first checkpoint, i.e. when the weights of the model are random? What is the gap between these case those taken for the current experiments?\n\n13. What is the time execution/complexity of the proposed approach. Does this depend on the pretrained model in consideration? For instance, would it take longer of LLaMa-13B than for BERT-110M?\n\n14. What is the performance per dataset when it comes to time series forecasting? The current experimental setting only reports results aggregated across different datasets."

                        "value": "We are extremely grateful for your review. You have raised many important issues. We agree with your comments and have modified our manuscript accordingly.\n\n1.\tDetails about related contrastive learning.\n\nResponse: We present more related work in Appendix 1.\n\n2.\tJitter and scale strategy.\n\nResponse: Sorry, given space limitations, some details have not been elaborated (Blue font in paragraph 1 of page 4). Here, the strategy is used for time series data augmentation: Weak augmentation is a jitter-and-scale strategy. We add random variations to the signal and scale up its magnitude; Strong augmentation is a permutation-and-jitter strategy, where permutation includes splitting the signal into a random number of segments with a maximum of M and randomly shuffling them. Please refer to: Eldele et al. Time-Series Representation Learning via Temporal and Contextual Contrasting. IJCAI 2021.\n\n3.\tThe selection of prototypes.\n\nResponse: The prototype is selected randomly. The prototypes (value, shape, frequency) shown in Figure 1 is an example. As in high dimensional space, almost all vectors are pairwise orthogonal, the number of prototypes rather than the type does matter (Blue font in paragraph 6 of page 5). Thus, by randomly selecting the same number of vectors, the represented space size and expressed number of features are almost the same (Appendix 2.5.2). \n\nFurther, time series does not have text description. How to align objective data (time series, collected from complex systems) with subjective data (text, created and can be perceived by humans) is a topic worth studying but currently unresolved. This work aligns embedding spaces of time series and text through similarity, although there is no semantics and somewhat rigid, it is an enlightening attempt.\n\n4.\tEmbeddings of each model.\n\nResponse: The embeddings are learned from text-prototype-aligned contrastive learning. For different models, we randomly select P text token embedding vectors from the dictionary of LLM\u2019s embedding layer as prototypes. As shown in Table 2, the embedding dimensions of different LLMs are different, e.g., 748, 1024.\n\n5.\tForecasting mode. \n\nResponse: The forecasting mode is the same as LLM, with tokens output sequentially, but our time series token is a subsequence, like subsequence-wise.\n\n6.\tReport all results.\n\nResponse: You can check them in Appendix 2.\n\n7.\tZero-shot evaluations.\n\nResponse: Zero-shot forecasting experiments are in Appendix 2.2.5. Compared to TS transformers, our model has better results.\n\n8.\tThe limiting performance in terms of model size. \n\nResponse: Our experiment shows that when the size reaches about 300M, its accuracy is comparable to SOTA TS models (Blue font in paragraph 4 of page 7). And we agree with your insight. The boundaries of model size, data size, and their ratio are very interesting and valuable research topic. We are conducting research on it now.\n\n9.\tAbout LM-QA.\n\nResponse: As you have considered, different prompts can lead to different results. In this work, we used the prompt templates by referring to Promptcast (Blue font in paragraph 3 of page 7).\n\nXue et al. Promptcast: A new prompt-based learning paradigm for time series\nforecasting. 2023.\n\n10.\tCompare with one-fits-all.\n\nResponse: In the original version, we compared with one-fits-all named GPT4TS as shown in Figure 3f (blue font in paragraph 3 of page 7). And when we implemented our method, one-fits-all only had a preprinted version and the code was not available. Thus, we directly used results they reported without rerunning code. In this revision, we added detailed results in Appendix. \n\n11.\tCompare with other models. \n\nResponse: Thanks for your reminder. In this revision, we have added more compared models in Appendix. And we\u2019d like to demonstrate that during our tests on the listed datasets, the methods you mentioned did not perform as well as the methods we compared. You can refer to: Wu et al. TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis. ICLR 2023.\n\n12.\tTime execution of encoder.\n\nResponse: The training of encoders for time series embeddings only needs to use the text embedding obtained from LLM\u2019s embedding layer and does not require training LLM. But LLMs are needed for training their head and inference. The encoder is a causal TCN (Blue font in paragraph 1 of page 7) and its training is fast, usually requiring only learn whole dataset once. Its detailed structure is in Appendix 2.1.1.\n\n13.\tThe related code.\n\nResponse: Related code and prompts will definitely be released. \n\n14.\tFigure 3.d.\n\nResponse: Sorry, it\u2019s a typo. The y axis should represent classification accuracy, we have corrected it.\n\n15.\tThe performance if using LLM with random parameters.\n\nResponse: This is an interesting thought, but it is not applicable to our approach as the random model does not have a trained embedding dictionary to use as prototypes.\n\n16.\tTypo.\n\nResponse: Thanks for your careful checks. We have corrected typos."

Experiments reveal that frozen LLMs equipped with the TEST strategy match or surpass current state-of-the-art TS models, enabling them to process TS data without losing language capabilities."

                        "value": "We truly appreciate your encouragement, careful review, and valuable suggestions. We have given more detailed descriptions of related work and experiments in the Appendix. Below we give a point-by-point response to your concerns and suggestions.\n\n1.\tThe connection between time series and text.\n\nResponse: We agree with your comment. The ideal scenario is for time series subsequences to have corresponding text semantics. Figure 4 shows a case. However, as time series data does not have textual description, this work aligns the time series embedding space and the text embedding space through similarity but not semantics. It is somewhat rigid. Thus, selecting different text prototypes will cause a subsequence to correspond to different texts.\nFurther, unlike images in multimodal alignment that can have text descriptions, time series data does not have corresponding text descriptions, how to align objective data (e.g. time series, collected from objective complex systems) with subjective data (e.g. text data, created by humans and can be perceived by humans) is a topic worth studying but currently unresolved. \n\n2.\tHow scalable is the proposed method.\n\nResponse: The related code and the trained prompts will definitely be released. In current work, encoders and prompts are both dataset-specific. That is, different time series datasets require training different encoder and soft prompt parameters. \nDifferent from the subjective text data, which can be perceived by humans, time series is more objective. The data from different scenarios varies greatly. Thus, it\u2019s hard to build a fundamental model for all types of time series. This means models for medical time series data may be difficult to use in meteorological time series data. For example, RNN-based models are suitable for modeling medium and low-frequency data (e.g. vital signs, having sequence dependency), CNN-based models are suitable for modeling high-frequency data (e.g. electrocardiogram, having patterns), Transformer-based models are suitable for modeling long-term medium frequency data (e.g. electricity, weather, having periodic and trend characteristics). In this work, we are exploring the ability of existing LLM to solve time series problems. We do not recommend fine-tuning LLM to time series data as it will result in a loss of language ability. We recommend using additional adapters, such as an external encoder in this work, to enhance its time series analysis capabilities. Of course, we still believe that the current mainstream approach for implementing time series tasks is the traditional model, and the general fundamental model for is the crucial future work."

The authors focus on the TS-for-LLM approach and propose a method called TEST (TimE Series tokens to align the Text embedding space of LLM). TEST tokenizes TS data, embeds it using instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, and aligns the TS embedding space with LLM's embedding layer space. Soft prompts are then created to make LLM more receptive to the embeddings. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theoretical analysis and experiments on TS classification, forecasting, few-shot, and representation tasks. The results show that pre-trained LLMs with the TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art TS models and offer benefits for few-shot learning and generalization. The authors hope this study will serve as a foundation for future research in the TS+LLM domain."

Based on the experience with LLM and multimodal fusion, it is possible to integrate LLM with image/video/speech representations using techniques such as adapters once good representations are obtained. Similarly, LLM4TS and TS4LLM can be fused with each other, for instance, when we obtain a good TS token embedding using TS4LLM, we can directly fine-tune the large model using LLM4TS, thereby achieving good performance. Therefore, is it appropriate to isolate LLM+TS into LLM4TS and TS4LLM as two distinct categories?\n2. Time series prediction is a crucial task, and as observed from the experiments in this paper, there is a significant gap between TS4LLM, LLM4TS, and traditional methods when performing this task. Have the authors considered analyzing the reasons for this discrepancy?\n3. In the statement \"...we choose P representative text embedding tp as pivots/prototypes...\", what specific type of text does P represent?"

                        "value": "We are extremely grateful for your review of the manuscript. You have raised a number of important issues. We agree with your comments and have modified our manuscript accordingly. We have given more detailed descriptions of related work and experiments in the Appendix. Below we give a point-by-point response to your concerns and suggestions. \n\n1.\tThe categories of LLM4TS and TS4LLM. \n\nResponse: We agree with the situation you mentioned. From a technical perspective, these two ideas can be integrated and may work better together. But we give these two categories to highlight different focuses: changing the model more or changing the data more. We want to present our views that fine-tuning LLM to TS data is unnecessary and not worth the loss. The method of changing data rather than models is more practical. The categories are more like purpose-wise instead of technology-wise.\nBut your suggestions will greatly help to improve the academic rigor of our paper. In this revision, we have provided footnotes for categories (The footnote in blue on page 1). From a technical perspective, LLM+TS can be achieved by pre-training, fine-tuning, tool-augmented methods, external encoders, and their ensemble.\n\n2.\tLLM+TS v.s. traditional methods. \n\nResponse: We have added more models, please refer to the Appendix for more detailed experiments.\n\nDifferent from the subjective text data, which can be perceived by humans, time series is more objective. The data from different scenarios varies greatly. Thus, it\u2019s hard to build a fundamental model for all types of time series. This means models for medical time series data may be difficult to use in meteorological time series data. For example, RNN-based models are suitable for modeling medium and low-frequency data (e.g. vital signs, having sequence dependency), CNN-based models are suitable for modeling high-frequency data (e.g. electrocardiogram, having patterns), Transformer-based models are suitable for modeling long-term medium frequency data (e.g. electricity, weather, having periodic and trend characteristics). In this work, we are exploring the ability of existing LLM to solve time series problems. We do not recommend fine-tuning LLM to time series data as it will result in a loss of language ability. We recommend using additional adapters, such as an external encoder in this work, to enhance its time series analysis capabilities. Of course, we still believe that the current mainstream approach for implementing time series tasks is the traditional model, and the general fundamental model for is the crucial future work.\n\n3.\tThe selection of prototypes.\n\nResponse: The prototype is selected randomly. The prototypes (value, shape, frequency) shown in the figure is an example. As in high dimensional space, almost all vectors are pairwise orthogonal, the number of prototypes rather than the type does matter (Blue font in paragraph 6 of page 5). Thus, by randomly selecting the same number of vectors, the represented space size and expressed number of features are almost the same (Appendix 2.5.2). \n\nFurther, time series data does not have textual description. How to align objective data (e.g. time series, collected from objective complex systems) with subjective data (e.g. text data, created by humans and can be perceived by humans) is a topic worth studying but currently unresolved. This work aligns the time series embedding space and the text embedding space through similarity, although there is no semantic relationship and it is somewhat rigid, it is also an enlightening attempt."

                    "value": "The paper introduces TEST, a TS-for-LLM method that leverages LLMs in time series (TS) data analysis without the need for fine-tuning. TEST focuses on transforming TS data into LLM-understandable embeddings. It shows potential in enhancing few-shot learning performance by harnessing the inherent knowledge within LLMs. The method involves training an encoder using contrastive learning, comprising three objectives: instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype objectives. The instance-wise objective pulls closer to similar instance embeddings. The feature-wise objective is applied to each feature column to further discriminate instances. The text-prototype objective aims to align the TS embeddings and prototype embedding using feature-wise loss. Learnable soft prompts are also employed to assist LLMs in understanding time series data. Experimental results demonstrate that TEST can rival or outperform current SOTA methods."

I would like to see an examination of the performance impact of removing the decoder component. It looks like the decoder is not a necessary component in the proposed method.\n3. The paper could be stronger from an ablation study to thoroughly investigate the effectiveness of the proposed components and objectives. For example, what's the performance without using soft-prompt or feature-wise objectives? This would help readers assess the contributions of each component."

                        "value": "We are extremely grateful for your review of the manuscript. You have raised a number of important issues. We agree with your comments and have modified our manuscript accordingly. We have given more detailed descriptions of related work and experiments in the Appendix. Below we give a point-by-point response to your concerns and suggestions. \n\n1.\tThe selection of prototypes.\n\nResponse: The prototype is selected randomly. The prototypes (value, shape, frequency) shown in the figure is an example. As in high dimensional space, almost all vectors are pairwise orthogonal, the number of prototypes rather than the type does matter (Blue font in paragraph 6 of page 5). Thus, by randomly selecting the same number of vectors, the represented space size and expressed number of features are almost the same (Appendix section 2.5.2). \n\nFurther, time series data does not have textual description. How to align objective data (e.g. time series, collected from objective complex systems) with subjective data (e.g. text data, created by humans and can be perceived by humans) is a topic worth studying but currently unresolved. This work aligns the time series embedding space and the text embedding space through similarity, although there is no semantic relationship and it is somewhat rigid, it is also an enlightening attempt.\n\n2.\tThe impact of the encoder. \n\nResponse: The decoder is the head of LLM. We use it as a pre-training trick. Of course, it is also possible to not train it during contrastive learning.\n\n3.\tAblation study.\n\nResponse: We agree with your comment. In this revision, we added more ablation experiments in Appendix section 2.5.\n\n4.\tThe use of PEFT methods.\n\nResponse: We agree with your comment. However, in our previous experiments, LoRA was not as good as p-tuning in the embedding layer. Personally, I think LoRA is more suitable for self-attention blocks.\n\nAnd your suggestion is also what we are considering. We suggest combining LLM and TS in a more effective way, rather than directly fine-tuning. In this way, it\u2019s more possible to enable LLM to have both language and TS analysis capabilities. Thus, beyond this work, we are exploring a plugin-based paradigm of LLM+TS. Plugins are likely to be the additional adapters or external encoders, implemented by using the PEFT methods, like LoRA. The current experiment results show that the PEFT-based plugins can also produce nice results."
