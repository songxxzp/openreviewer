                    "value": "The paper discusses memorization issue of diffusion models used in generating images from text prompts. Text-conditional diffusion models employ a pre-trained text encoder, which controls the alignment of image generation to a given prompt. Observations reveal that diffusion models generate diverse images for the same text prompt but different initializations. However, with different prompts but identical initializations, the images display similarities. When the model uses memorized prompts, the output tends to be consistent, hinting at overfitting. One of the significant findings is the relationship between the magnitude of text-conditional noise predictions and the chances of an image being memorized. This paper proposed a method, allowing early detection of memorized prompts, potentially saving computational resources. The effectiveness of this method is further discussed in an experimental setup, where it surpasses other baseline methods in speed and accuracy. Additionally, the concept of \\emph{trigger tokens} is introduced. These are specific words or tokens in a prompt that have a significant impact on the generation process. A technique is provided to identify these tokens, allowing users to modify them to mitigate memorization. In summary, the paper explores the intricacies of diffusion models in generating images from text prompts and provides methods to detect and counter memorized image generation."

This method is both computationally efficient and does not require multiple generations or access to the original training data, ensuring data privacy and reducing computational overhead.\n\n2. This work offers an automated approach to identify specific \"trigger tokens\" in memorized prompts that have a significant influence on the generation process. Instead of manual identification or experimentation with various token combinations, which can be cumbersome and inefficient, the paper's method assesses the change applied to each token while minimizing the magnitude of text-conditional noise prediction. This innovative approach provides model owners with a practical tool to advise users on how to modify or omit these trigger tokens, which can significantly mitigate the effects of memorization.\n\n3. The authors introduce mitigation methods that cater to both inference and training phases. For inference, a perturbed prompt embedding is suggested, achieved by minimizing the magnitude of text-conditional predictions. During training, potentially memorized image-text pairs can be screened out based on the magnitude of text-conditional predictions. These methods not only address the concerns of memorization but also ensure a more consistent alignment between prompts and generations. The experiments conducted, as per the paper's context, seem to support the efficacy of these strategies when benchmarked against baseline mitigation methods."

                    "value": "1. While the mitigation strategies aim to reduce memorization, it's unclear what impact they might have on the overall performance of the model. Often, there's a trade-off between reducing a particular behavior and maintaining high performance. If these mitigation strategies significantly impair the model's utility, it might deter their adoption.\n\n2. As stated in the paper, a weakness of the proposed method is the lack of interpretability in the detection strategy of memorized prompts. The current approach requires the model owners to select an empirical threshold based on a predetermined false positive rate, but the outcomes generated lack clear interpretability. This lack of clarity can make it difficult for model owners to fully understand and trust the detection process. The authors acknowledge that developing a method that produces interpretable p-values could significantly assist model owners by providing a confidence score quantifying the likelihood of memorization. \n\n3. Advising users on modifying or omitting trigger tokens might be effective in theory, but in practice, it could be cumbersome. Users might need to understand what these tokens are, why they need to modify them, and how they affect the output. This could make the user experience less intuitive, especially for those unfamiliar with the inner workings of AI models.\n\n4. The paper assumes that all prompts can be modified or that users will be willing to modify them. In real-world scenarios, some prompts might be non-negotiable, and changing them might not be an option.\n\n5. While the paper suggests that the method is computationally efficient, implementing the strategies during the training and inference phases might still introduce computational or operational overheads for model owners."

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate your valuable feedback and the time you've dedicated to providing it. Below, we address specific points you raised:\n\n> While the mitigation strategies aim to reduce memorization, it's unclear what impact they might have on the overall performance of the model. Often, there's a trade-off between reducing a particular behavior and maintaining high performance. If these mitigation strategies significantly impair the model's utility, it might deter their adoption.\n\nYes, as shown in Figure 4, there is a small degradation in CLIP score for inference-time mitigation, but not for training-time mitigation. However, we want to emphasize that in practice, the model owner can deploy detection and mitigation strategies at the same time. Therefore, the mitigation will be only applied to memorized prompts, and, in general case, the model performance will not be impaired.\n\nMeanwhile, compared to the copyright issue or privacy issue of outputting memorized training data, we believe it is still beneficial to the company with a little drop in CLIP score in the memorization case.\n\n> User interaction\n\nWe acknowledge your concerns regarding the potential complexity of modifying prompts for some users. However, prompt interaction might be a potential feature. A notable example of this is OpenAI's DALL-E 3, which allows users to iteratively refine their prompts to achieve the desired results. This advanced level of user interaction illustrates both the practicality and the growing trend of user familiarity with such interactive processes. We anticipate that, in the future, users will become increasingly adept at interacting with the models.\n\nAddressing memorization is crucial for users. If the model's outputs contain copyrighted images, users who further utilize these images might also encounter legal issues. Additionally, for memorized prompts, the generated content is often limited to the memorized images. Therefore, modifying the prompt is beneficial for the users to achieve more diverse generations.\n\nFurthermore, for situations where users find it cumbersome to modify prompts or encounter hard-to-alter tokens, the automatic inference-time mitigation method proposed by our paper could be an alternative. This option provides flexibility, catering to different user preferences and capabilities.\n\nOverall, our proposed method offers a new perspective on designing user interfaces and addressing the issue of memorization. We believe that our approach contributes valuable insights for future developments in the field.\n\n> While the paper suggests that the method is computationally efficient, implementing the strategies during the training and inference phases might still introduce computational or operational overheads for model owners.\n\nWe agree that there is a small computational overhead for model owners. Specifically, as mentioned in our paper, our detection method does not require additional computation since the text-conditional noise prediction is calculated during inference. Meanwhile, the inference-time mitigation incurs around 6 seconds for optimization, and a 10% increase in time for training-time mitigation. These costs are negligible compared to potential lawsuits due to memorization. Also, we believe that there is no free lunch to mitigate memorization. Therefore, a minor cost to achieve effective memorization reduction is acceptable.\n\n> Is there any way to quatify memorization in the diffusion models that the future method could use to benchmark? It might be good to have a discussion in this direction.\n\nYes, in our work, we adopt the definition of memorization from previous research [1], where we measure the SSCD similarity between training and generated images using the memorized prompts dataset from [2].\n\nHowever, we acknowledge the potential for developing a more comprehensive benchmark in the future. For instance, categorizing memorization into different types of legal copyright infringement could offer more practical insights. This approach would allow for a comparative analysis of methods under various memorization categories. Although establishing such a benchmark may be labor-intensive, we believe it is crucial and advantageous for advancing the development of reliable generative AI."

These models sometimes simply reproduce images from their training set which could present legal challenges for model owners\n\t- One real life examples of this in Midjourney, which had to ban prompts with the substring \"Afghan\" to avoid generating images reminiscent of the renowned copyrighted photograph of the \"Afghan girl\"\n\t- \n- In this work, the authors introduce a metric to detect such memorized prompts based on the magnitude of \"text-conditional predictions\". Memorized prompts tend to have a higher magnitude than non-memorized prompts.\n\t- Extending this the authors also devise a strategy to highlight the influence of each token in the prompt in driving memorization. This is done by evaluating the change in gradient for every token when minimizing the \"text-conditional prediction\" magnitude. This gives the relative important of each token to memorization. \n\t- This can be used to provide feedback to prompt designers to omit, modify these pivotal trigger tokens in their prompt.\n\t- Stable diffusion uses classifier-free guidance to steer the sampling diffusion process. During the reverse diffusion process the noise part of the original equation is modified to minimize distance from  the embedding of the text computed using a pre-trained CLIP encoder. This difference term is referred to as the \"text-conditional noise prediction\". The metric proposed in the paper is defined as the L2 norm of \"text-conditional noise\" term divided by the number of sampling steps \n\t\t- A smaller magnitude for this term signifies the final image is closely aligned its initialization\nBaseline & Dataset:\n- The authors use the 500 memorized prompts from Webster 2023 for stable diffusion v1 where SSCD similarity score between memorized and generated images exceeds 0.7\n- The detection method from Carlini 2023 is used as baseline\n- They also use an additional baseline where instead of using L2 distance like Carlini 2023 they replace it with distance in the SSCD feature space."

Below, we address specific points you raised:\n\n> How is the metric computed with multiple generations in Table 1?\n\nFor each prompt, the final metric is calculated as an average across all generations.\n\n> In Table 1, what does the column First 10 steps indicate, is it the AUC, TPR values calculated with the average of metric values for the first 10 steps of the diffusion process?\n\nYour interpretation is correct. It is calculated based on the average metric obtained during the initial 10 steps of the denoising process.\n\n> Clarification of \"An effective inference-time mitigation method\"\n\nWe initiate the process with the original prompt embedding and employ gradient descent using the Adam optimizer. The objective function for this optimization is detailed in Equation 5 of our paper. It is crucial to note that this optimization process does not involve any data and is conducted independently for different prompts.\n\nRegarding Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the results were derived from an evaluation of 5 x 200 data points from the LAION dataset, with '5' representing five different random seeds. The detailed experiment setting can be found in section 4.4.\n\nWe appreciate your insights pointing out ambiguities in our paper. We will address these issues to enhance clarity in the future version. Please let us know if you have any more questions."

Does it require an exact match between the generated and training images? For instance, if there's a slight variation, such as a difference of 10 pixels from the original image in the training dataset, would that still be considered memorization?\n\nFollowing [1], we employ the SSCD similarity score to measure memorization. As indicated in our experimental setup, for all memorized prompts from [2], the SSCD similarity score between the memorized and generated images is above 0.7.\n\n[1] and we advocate for the use of SSCD similarity over pixel space distance as a more reliable measure. This is especially relevant in cases where the generated image partially replicates the training image. SSCD focuses on structural and content similarities, not just pixel-level accuracy. This approach offers a more nuanced and context-sensitive evaluation of memorization.\n\n> Exploring Applications for Memorization Detection: I'm interested in understanding the practical uses of detecting memorized images. What are some key scenarios or fields where identifying such images is particularly important or beneficial?\n\nWhen using training datasets that are not as meticulously curated as, for example, the LAION dataset, there is a significant risk of including copyrighted or private images. This underscores the importance of detecting and preventing memorized images, particularly in two primary scenarios:\n1. copyrighted images: When a model generates an image that is an exact replica of a copyrighted image, the owner of that copyright may have grounds to sue the model owner. This situation can result in financial losses for the model owner.\n2. private images: The situation becomes more critical if the memorized image contains private data, like a patient's CT scan. Unauthorized reproduction of such private images can result in severe breaches of privacy, leading to legal and ethical issues.\n\nGiven these scenarios, it is evident that the need for an effective memorization detection tool goes beyond these examples. There are likely other scenarios where such a tool would be crucial in managing the potential risks.\n\nWe hope our response can solve your concern regarding our paper.

The authors use a very neat observation that in the case of text-guided diffusion models, the actual text prompt is very important for the final generated image. In particular, as seen by Wen et al., in the cases when the text prompt is important, irrespective of the initialization, the model would typically converge to the same image. However, in other cases, the initialization can change the model generation a lot. Using this insight, they detect memorization by evaluating the impact of the text on the model generation. The work is then further solidified by using this both as a detection and mitigation measure, surpassing past works not only by efficiency but also by performance."

Further, it is much better than past works, both l2, and SSCD metrics in terms of the AUC and the true positive rate at 1% false positive rate. \n3. The proposed mitigation strategies at inference time are very interesting and much more performant than the previously discussed baseline of random token addition. In particular, the method and the insight naturally offer a way of understanding which tokens were responsible for memorization and can be removed appropriately. \n4. In the case of training time mitigation, the authors see significant improvement in the model performance as opposed to when you're doing random token addition. \n5. Overall, this paper is a very enjoyable read and a strong work in the field of memorization and especially when considering diffusion models."

We will thoroughly revise these sections to enhance readability for the camera-ready version. Meanwhile, we are glad that you find the motivation section is helpful.\n\n> In terms of the experimental setting, I do believe that performing experiments to see how the memorization ratio changes with repetitions in the data set might be a great way to further solidify if the method works.\n\nWe are grateful for your suggestion to investigate the memorization ratio with varying data repetitions. We have conducted additional experiments with different data duplication times: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, and 300 times. The results with the SSCD similarity scores before and after applying the inference-time mitigation are presented in the table below. The proposed method is effective in all situtations with the same target loss for mitigation. We believe this is a good add-on for the future version.\n\n| duplication times |   50  |  100  |  150  |  200  |  250  |  300  |\n|:---------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|  No Mitigation  | 0.544 | 0.556 | 0.559 | 0.561 | 0.562 | 0.570 |\n| With Mitigation | 0.328 | 0.341 | 0.342 | 0.350 | 0.351 | 0.367 |\n\n> I would love to see more images of memorized inputs and further discussion beyond the two images shown in the paper right now to get a better sense of the performance of this method.\n\nWe agree that more examples of memorized inputs would be beneficial. We have included additional memorized and non-memorized images and corresponding magnitudes of text-conditional noise prediction in Figure 8 and Figure 9 respectively in the appendix of the updated draft.\n\n> Most pertinently, I see that the mitigation strategies lead to a significant drop in CLIP score.

I am not able to position these results with the overall setup.\n\nWe recognize your concerns regarding the observed decrease in CLIP score to the inference-time mitigation. This issue primarily arises from the model's significant overfitting to memorized data points, making it challenging to achieve high CLIP scores during inference without additional model retraining or fine-tuning. However, we want to emphasize that in practice, the model owner can deploy our proposed detection (section 3.3) and mitigation (section 4.2) strategy at the same time. Therefore, the mitigation will be only applied to memorized prompts, and, in non-memorization cases, the model performance will not be impaired.\n\nMeanwhile, we believe that a slight drop in CLIP score is still beneficial to the company when compared to the issues of copyright infringement or privacy violations due to outputting memorized training data.\n\nWe hope our response can solve your concern regarding our paper.
