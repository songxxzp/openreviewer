Here are two examples:\n\n* **Example 1**\n\nInput: \"Write a quote that ends in the word 'day': Good clothes open all\"\n\nStandard LM Output: \"doors\"\n\nICLM Output: \"day\"\n\n* **Example 2**\n\nInput: \"Write a quote that ends in the word 'frequent': Delays are\"\n\nStandard LM Output: \"dangerous\"\n\nICLM Output: \"frequent\"\n\nThese 2 examples are representative of the quality of the results we find from this evaluation, which we will add to the paper in fuller detail. They additionally corroborate our extensive evaluations."

Specifically, they first construct a document graph in which the documents are nodes and edges are valued by the similarity between two documents. Then they employ a greedy strategy to concatenate the documents, i.e., constructing the sequence for language pre-training.\nEmpirical evaluations across multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that in-context pre-training consistently surpasses the performance of the baseline, except on close-booked question answering."

                    "value": "1. Clear motivation and presentation: enhancing LM\u2019s understanding of context is intriguing and makes a lot of sense to me. The authors effectively articulate the problem, motivation, and proposed solution, making it easy to follow and comprehend the paper.\n2. Strong empirical results and interesting findings: the comprehensive experiments provide compelling evidence that in-context pre-training (achieved by simply constructing sequence with relevant documents) yields improvements across diverse downstream tasks, with the exception of close-booked question answering.\n3. Reproducibility: the proposed approach is straightforward to reimplement, requiring only minor modifications to existing pre-training procedures for further exploration and validation. The traversal process is also clearly delineated."

In Section 3.3.4, the authors attribute the inconsistent performance in a closed-book setting to the \u201cICLM memorizes less\u201d. This claim could benefit from further elaboration. As we see better perplexity on language modeling, seems ICLM should memorizes more with the help of relevant documents.\n2. According to the presented results, ICLM outperforms baselines in in-context settings. Experiments in out-of-context setting could be added for us to better understand the proposed ICLM.\n3. The related work section could be improved by discussing a broader range of previous studies.  For example, the first paragraph of Section 5 only refers to three papers to summarize \u2018pre-training with related documents\u2019, however, there are other works with similar ideas including [1] use dictionary as context, [2] use co-occurrence of words across sentences as context for language pre-training, among others.\n\n[1] Yu et al.

Could the authors offer additional information regarding the 'standard way' of constructing the sequence? To my understanding, it's common to create a sequence using texts from successive documents[3], wherein the texts are naturally semantically relevant to each other. Is the approach different in this case because the sequence length is so extensive that most documents cannot fill a single sequence? I would appreciate further clarification on this matter.\n2. Could you provide an estimate of the time required for the graph construction and traversal processes at your experimental scale?\n3. I am intrigued by the scalability of the proposed approach in a practical context. If we receive new raw text data, will we have to repeat the similarity computation, graph construction and graph traversal processes?\n\n[3]  Liu et al.

As we see better perplexity on language modeling, seems ICLM should memorizes more with the help of relevant documents.\n\nThis is a good point, thanks. It is true the ICLM and memorize more if you consider the documents in the datastore part of the complete model. This also has other advantages often seen in retrieval augmented methods. We will rewrite to clarify this point. \n\n---\n\n> According to the presented results, ICLM outperforms baselines in in-context settings. Experiments in out-of-context setting could be added for us to better understand the proposed ICLM.\n\n| Dataset     | Standard | ICLM  |\n|-------------|----------|-------|\n| RACE-High   | 36.4     | **37.8**  |\n| RACE-Middle | 48.5     | **50.2**  |\n| BoolQ       | 62.1     | **63.3**  |\n| Amazon      | 83.4     | **83.5**  |\n\nThese results demonstrate that ICLM performs better than the standard method in zero-shot settings. We will conduct more extensive evaluation in zero-shot settings and include the results in the final version of the paper. \n\n---\n\n\n> The related work section could be improved by discussing a broader range of previous studies. For example, the first paragraph of Section 5 only refers to three papers to summarize \u2018pre-training with related documents\u2019, however, there are other works with similar ideas including [1] use dictionary as context, [2] use co-occurrence of words across sentences as context for language pre-training, among others.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing us to related works. [1][2] improves LMs\u2019 understanding of rare words, where [1] integrates definitions of these words, and [2] includes contextual vectors from previously encountered contexts mentioning the same words. **We have incorporated these papers into our related work section (highlighted in yellow).**\n\n---\n\n> Could the authors offer additional information regarding the 'standard way' of constructing the sequence? To my understanding, it's common to create a sequence using texts from successive documents[3], wherein the texts are naturally semantically relevant to each other. Is the approach different in this case because the sequence length is so extensive that most documents cannot fill a single sequence? \n\nYes, the approach is different in this case because the sequence length is so extensive that most documents cannot fill a single sequence. The standard pretraining method concatenate documents that are randomly ordered, as seen in [3]. [3] creates a sequence using **consecutive sentences within a document**. \u200b\u200bHowever, upon reaching a document\u2019s end, the method still requires switching to a new, randomly selected document.  [3] pretrains language models with short context windows (512 tokens long). The context window size is short enough that a single document could potentially occupy the entire window.\n\nHowever, with the trend of extending context window sizes in language model, the standard pretraining method encounters issues. The average pretraining document spans about 1,000 tokens, while newer models like LLAMA employ a 4,000-token context window and ChatGPT takes up to 16,000 tokens. In such scenarios, the standard pretraining method, which concatenates random documents, poses significant challenges in maintaining contextual coherence and relevance. Through our evaluation of downstream tasks, even if the task of interest does not necessarily require a long context, our results show that our in-context pretraining is better because it enhances the ability to read and understand relevant context more effectively."

                    "value": "A naive approach to language modeling on large corpora often considers randomly concatenating documents within the corpora together during training, resulting in long contexts which may not be relevant to the current next-word prediction. In this work, the authors conjecture that this naive approach harms a models ability to learn to attend to long-range dependencies during both language modeling, as well as down-stream tasks. To address this, the authors propose In-context pretraining (ICP), which, prior to language model pre-training, groups and sorts document by their similarity such that a language model is trained on several related documents contiguously.\n\nTo perform this grouping, ICP first uses _contreiver_ (a similarity-based retriever model from prior work) to first obtain a set of nearest neighbors for each document. Then the authors propose a modified version of a greedy algorithm to the traveling salesman problem to obtain a path through all the documents such that no documents repeat but most documents will appear next to their nearest neighbors. The resulting path is then treated as the document order for input to the LM, which is split into several contiguous chunks which serve as the pre-training corpora.\n\nThe authors consider two baselines: naive pre-training, which randomly shuffles and concatenates documents together, and kNN pre-training, which groups documents by similarity, but can have high document duplication and overlap.\nThe authors demonstrate that LLMs trained with ICP significantly outperform standard LMs and kNN LMs on both language modeling, as well as on several downstream tasks including in-context learning, reading comprehension, and retrieval augmentation, highlighting the importance of long-range consistency and dependency in LM pre-training."

What is the difference between the results presented in 4.2 for Document Relevance, and the results presented in Figure 3 (a)?\n\nIn our ablation study for ICLM, we study different levels of document relevance from least to most relevant: random, clustering, and links built by ICLM. In the clustering scenario, documents grouped in the same context are sourced from the same clusters, indicating topical similarity but not necessarily close relation. In contrast, ICLM links documents as nearest neighbors, indicating a higher degree of similarity.\n\nDifferent from Figure 3 (a), Section 4.2 provides an in-depth exploration of how varying degrees of document similarity \u2013 categorized into three levels: random, clustering (documents on the same topic), and links (closely related) \u2013 affect the performance of LMs. **We have updated Section 4.2 ablation study with a few additional details, which are highlighted in yellow for easy identification.**\n\n---\n\n> The core methodological contribution of the paper is perhaps relatively small.

A key strength of our method is it is simple and effective. It requires only modifications to the document ordering during pretraining, making it directly applicable to existing pretraining data pipelines. Despite its simplicity, our approach has demonstrated substantial improvements in downstream task performance."

We respond to the reviewer\u2019s comments and questions below.\n\n---\n\n> Lack of comparison with existing works. Some previous studies have used hyperlinks or timestamps to group related documents together. Although these papers are discussed in the Related Work section, it would be beneficial to understand how the proposed method compares to these existing approaches by reporting the results.\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that using hyperlinks is a great idea. However, as we mention in the related work section, hyperlinks may not always be available across all domains. For instance, a part of the commomncrawl pretraining corpus includes short flash fictions from sources like 365tomorrows.com, where individual stories typically lack hyperlinks. Our proposed retrieval method can generalize to corpora with potentially any text in any domain.\n\n---\n\n> Lack of information about the computational and time costs of the Retrieval process and DOCUMENT GRAPH TRAVERSAL process. \nAs detailed in Appendix A.2 and Section 3.1, we have outlined the specific time and resource requirements for our proposed algorithm. To elaborate:\n\n* The retrieval index building process requires approximately 7 mins.\n* The search step is conducted on 32 GPUs and takes around 6 hours for processing 300 billion tokens (235 million documents).\n* The document graph traversal phase requires 12 hours on a setup of 20 CPUs.\n\n**We have updated Section 3.1 with a few additional details, which are highlighted in yellow for easy identification.**\n\n---\n\n> Do you want to discuss the code data and the proposed method? Maybe for the code data, each repository should be concatenated together instead of relying on retrieval. Is this a possible limitation of the proposed method?\n\nThank you for suggesting this idea. We agree that concatenating code data from the same repository could be an effective approach. **We have revised Section 6, the Conclusion, to include a discussion of this idea as a future work (highlighted in yellow).**\n\n---\n\n> Are you using a multilingual Contriver or an English Contriver? \n\nWe are using English Contriever. Thanks for your suggestion. We agree that a multilingual approach could be useful and we would consider it for future research. **We have updated Section 6, the Conclusion to discuss this idea as a future work (highlighted in yellow)**"
