                    "value": "The paper proposes a novel technique for finding graph lottery tickets (GLTs), which are sparse graph neural networks (GNNs) and sparse input graphs that can reduce the inference cost and complexity compared to their dense counterparts. The technique called adversarially robust graph sparsification (ARGS), aims to improve the robustness of GLTs against different structure perturbation attacks, which are attacks that modify the graph structure to degrade the performance of GNNs. ARGS consists of pruning the perturbed adjacency matrix and the GNN weights by optimizing a novel loss function that captures the graph homophily property and the information from both the true labels and the pseudo labels. ARGS can be applied iteratively to find adversarially robust GLTs (ARGLTs) that are highly sparse yet achieve competitive performance under different structure attacks. The paper evaluates ARGS on six datasets and shows that it outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and sparsity."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "* The novelty of the method proposed in this paper needs further clarification in my opinion, though the studied problem is novel. The method combines the existing observations into the UGS framework to handle the adversarial attack in large and densely connected graphs. However, the studied graphs are small according to [1]. Therefore, the main focus should be on large graphs such as ogb-products or ogb-papers100M to demonstrate the method\u2019s scalability, which is not reflected in the current manuscript. Meanwhile, given the observations are intuitive and might not be generalizable in very large graphs (e.g., only observed on cora and citeseer, both have nodes less than 10k), theoretical supports that demonstrate the results could be scaled to graphs with massive nodes should be included from my perspective.\n\n* The paper is loosely written with many grammar errors and broken format. For example, \u201c\u2026many defense techniques have been developed that try to improve the classification accuracy\u2026\u201d on Page 1. Fig. and Figure are randomly used. The same for equation and Equation. And there is a missing title for the Table on Page 8. I suggest the authors carefully revise the manuscript to make it more self-contained.\n\n* Why the training process of ARGS (Eq.7) and the finding process of ARGLT (Eq.8) are separated but not unitedly trained as in UGS?\n\n* Many recent works tackling graph robustness are not covered in the related works/compared as baselines, especially spectral-based methods such as [2-5]. \n\n* Experimental settings are vaguely described. For example, how the adaptive attack is performed is unclear. Meanwhile, Table 1 (which should be Table 2?) contains the results of the adaptive attack for ARGS only but no other baselines such as GNNGUARD/UGS, which could not sufficiently reflect the effectiveness of ARGS. Meanwhile, for the defense on large graphs, it is confusing whether the baseline in Figure 6 is GCN or GARNET. The baseline Soft Median from [1] should be added for better comparison on the scalability evaluation.\n\n[1] Robustness of Graph Neural Networks at Scale, NeurIPS 2021\n\n[2] Adversarial Attacks on Node Embeddings via Graph Poisoning, ICML 2019\n\n[3] A Restricted Black-box Adversarial Framework Towards Attacking Graph Embedding Models, AAAI 2020\n\n[4] Not All Low-Pass Filters are Robust in Graph Convolutional Networks, NeurIPS 2021\n\n[5] Robust Graph Representation Learning for Local Corruption Recovery, WWW 2023"

By analyzing the patterns of current attacking approaches (Figure 3), a new loss term $\\mathcal{L}_{fs}$ is proposed to prune both malicious and irrelevant edges at the same time. Moreover, this loss term is universal for homophilic and heterophilic graphs, except that we need to consider the positional features instead of the node features for heterophilic graphs in this case. This is an interesting observation, and the importance of this term is verified by the ablation studies (Table 2). I am a little bit suspicious of the other term $\\mathcal{L}_1$ though, where the authors use a new MLP trying to predict the test labels and use those with high confidence during training. Please see more details in the Questions part.\n\nIn summary, I think the observations and the method proposed in this paper are technically sound, and should be beneficial to the graph learning community."

As a matter of fact, I think the design of $\\mathcal{L}_{fs}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_1$ heavily relies on the assumption that node features and labels would not change, which limits the application of the proposed approach. I am not sure what types of attacks are considered in Adaptive Attacks [1], but I do not see the intuition why ARGS would perform well when node features and graph topologies change at the same time.\n\nSecondly, most datasets considered in the simulations are of small scale. Even OGB-ArXiv is also small, compared to other node classification benchmark datasets on OGB. I agree that it is totally okay to conduct simulations on standard datasets like the citation networks, and I guess the bottleneck would be running the attacks on the huge graphs, but I really do think it is much more interesting to perform this kind of task (finding robust GLT) on large-scale graphs where the graph + model sparsification is really needed.\n\n[1] Felix Mujkanovic, Simon Geisler, Stephan Gunnemann, and Aleksandar Bojchevski.

Since ARGS can also be viewed as some kind of graph denoising, I would expect it to still outperform pure UGS in the normal training scheme.\n\n2. How will Figure 3 look like if we also consider the positional features for homophilic graphs? If the pattern is still the same, why don't we just use the positional features for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs in $\\mathcal{L}_{fs}$?\n\n3. Is the term $\\mathcal{L}_1$ still beneficial when we only have a very limited training set? And how shall we determine the confidence threshold for the test nodes?"
