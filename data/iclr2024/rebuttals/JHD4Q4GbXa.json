Specifically, the authors claim that conflict between multimodal and unimodal learning objectives may be harmful to the performance of uni-modal encoders. To address this issue, the authors propose to intergrate the gradients of unimodal and multimodal losses using a modified Pareto method. The authors also try to developed a theory to analysis the benefit of the proposed method. They claim that the established generalization bound for conventional Pareto is looser than its counterparts. Experimental studies are taken to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MMPareto."

The established generalization error bounds of SGD without any gradient integration strategy and Pareto gradient integration are shown in equation. 4 and equation. 5 respectively. As the authors claim, we have $0\\leq\\gamma\\leq 1$ for Pareto gradient integration. It seems that the generalization error bound of Pareto gradient integration (i.e., eq. 5) is not loose but tighter than that in eq. 4. This is very confusing for me, and thus raise my concern about the soundness of the main theoretical results.\n- Although the authors try to shed some light upon the pitfall of conventional Pareto algorithm considering multimodal learning problem. Their theorical results may not support the proposed method MMPareto directly. Is the proposed MMPareto have a tighter generalization error bound than their counterparts? The authors should clarify this more explicitly.\n- The proposed method is working under the condition that multitask-like learning object is involved. However, many multimodal learning models can not give a prediction on unimodal input. I think the authors need to clarify this limitation in the future."

We greatly appreciate your insightful feedback and constructive comments.\n\nWe thank you for pointing out the concern about the established generalization error bounds of SGD. We realize this issue and rethink the effect of generalization when using traditional Pareto method.\n\nOne possible idea is that we know the magnitude will be decreased when using traditional Pareto method. Then, based on the past studies [A,B], the decrease in gradient magnitude in SGD will weaken the noise term in SGD, then accordingly affect the generalization.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your valuable review and we will resubmit the revised manuscript for the next conference.\n\nSincerely,\n\nAuthors\n\n\n\n[A] Jastrz\u0119bski, S., Kenton, Z., Arpit, D., Ballas, N., Fischer, A., Bengio, Y., & Storkey, A.

                    "value": "This paper tackles the problem of imbalanced multi-modal learning where all modalities are not utilized properly by the model leading to limited performance. The authors point out gradient conflicts between uni-modal and multi-modal losses as a potential reason for this problem. Noting the similarity to gradient conflicts that exist in multi-task learning, they propose to utilize the pareto integration strategy from the multi-task learning literature to obtain gradients which are common to both the uni-modal and multi-modal objectives. However, the multi-modal problem generally leads to smaller gradients for the multi-modal loss which leads to the conventional method to assign larger weight to only the multi-modal gradient. Thus, they propose to rescale the gradients to better the uni-modal performance. Experiments are conducted on two audio-visual datasets (CREMA-D and Kinetics Sounds) and Colored/Gray MNIST and achieves good performance in both uni-modal and multi-modal cases when compared to baselines."

                    "value": "This paper introduces the MMPareto algorithm, which addresses the challenge of imbalanced multi-modal learning. While previous methods have used targeted uni-modal constraints to improve performance, the authors identify a gradient conflict between multi-modal and uni-modal learning objectives that hinders optimization. This conflict is mitigated using the Pareto method, but traditional Pareto methods do not work well in multi-modal scenarios. The authors propose the MMPareto algorithm, which ensures a direction that benefits all objectives while preserving magnitude, thus improving model generalization. Empirical results across various datasets with different modalities demonstrate the superior performance of this method."

It identifies a previously overlooked challenge in multi-modal learning, the gradient conflict between multi-modal and uni-modal learning objectives. \nThe proposed MMPareto algorithm presents a novel approach to address this issue, offering a fresh perspective on multi-modal learning optimization.\nThe paper is well-written and effectively communicates its ideas. The introduction provides a clear problem statement, and the logical flow of the paper makes it easy for readers to follow. It provides theoretical analysis, clearly presenting the problem and the solution. Authors well motivated the challenges of traditional method and the necessity of bringing the MMPareto algorithm. \nThe algorithm is well-structured and theoretically grounded, and its implementation is evaluated across multiple datasets, showcasing its robustness."
