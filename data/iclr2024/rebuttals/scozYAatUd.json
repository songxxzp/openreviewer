It is possible that the model performs better on the majority of the samples, but encounters some particularly challenging cases where its accuracy drops.Optimizing for top-5% accuracy alone not be the primary goal. Top 1 is more important. \n\nQ2: Is the improvement in the performance of the proposed method due to this parallel structure of fusing features at different scales, or is it the discrete wavelet transform?\nboth"

By exploiting the multi scale structures in natural images, the authors introduce a multi-scale wavelet attention, which perform of a convolution with nonlinearity on the wavelet coefficients of input feature maps and followed by an inverse wavelet transform. Additionally, two convolutional skip branches are added to help learning high frequency details. The experiments show that the proposed method performs better compared to other baselines."

Multi-resolution based attentions have been proposed in multiple papers, such as H-Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11906) and MRA Attention (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10284). Since this paper also proposes multi-resolution attention, it should have a discussion on these works. \n\n3. It would be better to have an ablation study to evaluate the performance of three cases: 1. Three branches in Figure 1 are all enabled. 2. Only multi-scale branch is enabled. 3. Only two convolutional branches are enabled. This ablation study allows isolating the effects of two convolutional branches from the effects of multi-scale branch to better evaluate the multi-scale attention. \n\n4. Experiments are only performed on small datasets (CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet). It might be difficult to generalize the conclusion to larger scale datasets (such as ImageNet). \n\n5. The motivation of this paper is to solve the quadratic complexity of self-attention for high resolution vision, but all experiments are performed on short sequences: 64 tokens (32 x 32 with patch size 4) or 256 tokens (64 x 64 with patch size 4). \n\n6. The multi scale attention is operating on the (8 x 8 or 16 x 16) feature maps of the image. It is not clear whether the model really needs the multi-scale inductive bias at this scale."

                    "value": "The main weakness of this work is given by its presentation. While I believe the idea presented here to be promissing, I find the way in which it has been presented to be too convoluted, with motivations as well as many important details missing. In addition, the writing seems rushed, which is highlighted by replicated parts in the paper as well as some imprecisions in definitions and claims. Specifically:\n\n**Preliminaries**\n\n- \u201c... self-attention mechanism, an inductive bias that associates \u2026\u201d -> Do you mean operation? To the best of my understanding, an inductive bias is something different.\n\n- \u201c.. is a global operator, which means it may overlook or miss fine and moderate scale structures commonly present in natural images.\u201d -> I do not agree this is the case in general. To the best of my understanding, this is only the case if the global kernel used is intrinsically low-frequent. To give an example, several modern sequential models that rely on global convolutions \u2013either parameterized as Implicit Neural Representations [1,2,3,4] or SSMs [5,6,7,8]\u2013 are global yet able to describe high-frequencies. This ability allows them to model long sequences such as Language [9] and DNA sequences [10] in a fine-grained manner. If your claim were true, this would not be possible \u2013An analysis about this is given in [1].\n\n- Furthermore, note that these parameterizations also allow for the constructions of CNNs that require minimal inductive biases for various designs, e.g., [11, 12] \u2013see first paragraph.\n\n- Related to the previous comments: Note that long convolutional models, e.g., [1 - 11] all rely on smart parameterizations of convolutional kernels. Hence, it is not true that all global convolutional models have a large number of parameters for high resolution inputs  \u2013see Fourier based attention in the Related Work.\n\n- The authors present the non-adaptability of methods like MLP mixers as a limitation. However, to the best of my understanding, MWA also is non-adaptable \u2013see MLP based attention in the Related Work.\n\n- \u201cFFT can extract periodic patterns due to the use of sine and cosine functions to analyze images, but it is not suitable for studying the spatial behavior of images with non-periodic patterns.\u201d -> I believe this is incorrect. Do note that there exist several theorems that state that the Fourier transform can be used to describe arbitrary functions on a finite domain. If this were a problem, compression methods such as JPEG would not be as powerful and successful as they are. There is something to be said about periodicity, but just as for the Wavelet Transform, this comes from the assumption that signals are periodic outside the domain considered. Note that, like the Fourier transform (and FFT), applying convolutions on the Wavelet domain, also has a form of \u201ccircular convolution\u201d, which relies on the exact same assumption of periodicity.\n\n- In Table 1, I am not sure I understand where the quadratic terms of MWA and AFNO come from. If this were the case, then FFT convolutions as well as \u201cWavelet convolutions\u201d would also have quadratic complexity, right?  \n\n**Method.**\n \n- \u201cIn this work, we use all the coefficients of the last decomposition level\u201d. What do you mean here? Do you mean that you use all the coefficients up to that level? or only the ones of the last level of decompositions? Also, in practice only 1 level of decomposition is used. It is difficult to understand what this is referring to. \n\n- Related to the previous comment: \u201cIn DWT, the wavelet coefficients in the highest scale include the important features of the input\u2026\u201d I am not sure I understand what is meant here. \n\n- The author defines the Wavelet Neural Operator as a convolution on the Wavelet domain by means of multiplication. However, in Eq. 10, the authors suddenly change the operation to convolution on this space. Aside from not being motivated anywhere, this makes the method unnecessarily difficult to understand. Given that a convolution in Wavelet space is equivalent to multiplication in the spatial domain, I do not understand why this is used here. What is the motivation of using convolution on that space instead of multiplication? \n\n- In the 4th step, the authors introduce residual connections which are actually not residual. These are simply other branches composed of convs and non-linearities. \n\n**Empirical Setup.**\n\n- It is not clear from the paper what kind of \u201cConv\u201d is used in the Wavelet space \u2013I also went through the appendix and I was unable to find this. \n\n- Also, is the Wavelet decomposition used as an spatial input, or is each decomposition considered independently from one another? How are frequency components \u201cmixed\u201d across levels of decomposition?\n\n**Evaluation.**\n\n- Most of the papers\u2019 motivation swirls around efficiency. However, the authors do not evaluate the approach on large scale datasets such as ImageNet. Is there a reason for this? In my opinion it is difficult to evaluate the effect of using multi-scale approaches on low-resolution data. Is this the reason only a single level of decomposition is used?  Empirical evaluations on higher resolution datasets would be more convincing given this fact. \n\n- \u201c... It also significantly outperforms SA when the patch size is chosen to be 4.\u201d -> Which other patches were analyzed? I could not find any details about this.\n\n- It would be good to have a comparison in terms of time with other methods. Specifically, if I understood the paper well, I would expect the running time to be slower than methods based on global convolutions.\n\n- In Experiments, the authors refer to the patch size as \u201ctoken size\u201d. I would strongly encourage the authors to use consistent nomenclature throughout the paper.\n\n**Repetitions.**\n\nOne of the items at the end of Sec 5 is repeated. The definition of the datasets used in the experiments section is also repeated.\n\n**Appendix.**\n\n- The labeling of the tables and images here is incorrect. \n \n**Minor**\n\n- Please make correct use of \\pcite and \\tcite\n\n- Tabel is a consistent typo throughout the paper. The right word is Table."

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive comments and suggestions, and they are exceedingly helpful for us to improve our paper.\n\nQ1: ... self-attention mechanism, \u2026\u201d .\nIn the context of self-attention mechanisms, \"bias\" is actually the correct term, not \"operation\". The phrase should be \"an inductive bias that associates ...\". The attention mechanism introduces a bias towards certain interactions or associations between elements.\n\nQ2 :  \u201c.. is a global operator, ....\nAFNO, as a global operator, may sometimes overlook or miss fine and moderate scale structures commonly found in natural images. It does not make a general claim about all global operators. The effectiveness of global operators in capturing fine and moderate scale structures depends on the characteristics and design of the specific operator or model used. Modern sequential models, like the Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Structured-Sparse Models (SSMs) you mentioned, have demonstrated the ability to model high frequencies and capture fine-grained details even with global convolutions.These models utilize parameterizations and structures that enable them to capture and represent both low and high-frequency components adequately. This allows them to describe long sequences, such as language and DNA sequences, in a fine-grained manner.Therefore, it is essential to consider the specific characteristics and design choices of the global operator or model being used before making broad statements about their ability to capture fine and moderate scale structures.\n\nQ3 : \u201cFFT can extract periodic patterns.....\n\nThe Fourier Transform, including its discrete version (FFT), is indeed a powerful tool for analyzing signals and images, not limited to periodic patterns. It can represent arbitrary functions in terms of sinusoidal components, and its application extends to a wide range of signal processing tasks, including image analysis.While it's true that Fourier analysis is particularly well-suited for periodic signals due to the use of sine and cosine functions, it doesn't mean it's limited to periodic patterns. In fact, as you pointed out, the Fourier Transform can be applied to describe arbitrary functions on a finite domain. But Wavelet transform works better than Fourier transform for the following reasons\n1. Time-Frequency Localization: Wavelets provide excellent time-frequency localization, which means they can capture both high-frequency and low-frequency details of a signal at different time points. This is particularly useful when analyzing signals with non-stationary characteristics, where frequency content changes over time.\n2. Multiresolution Analysis: Wavelets offer a multiresolution analysis, meaning that they can capture signal details at different scales. This allows for the identification of localized features within a signal. Fourier transforms, on the other hand, provide a global frequency representation, making it difficult to analyze localized features.\n3. Edge Detection: Wavelets are effective in detecting edges and discontinuities in signals due to their ability to capture\n\nQ4: \u201cIn this work, we use all the coefficients .....\nAll the coefficients of the last level of analysis. We also did it with higher levels Decomposition.\n\nQ5:  \u201cIn DWT, the wavelet coefficients.....\nIn DWT, the wavelet coefficients in the highest scale refer to the smallest details or features in the input. These details are considered important as they contribute to the overall understanding of the input.\n\nQ6 : The author defines the Wavelet Neural Operator as a convolution ....\n\nConvolution operates by sliding a small kernel over the input space, multiplying the kernel's values with the corresponding input values at each position, and summing them up. This process takes into account the neighboring values, allowing for the detection of patterns, edges, and other spatially dependent features.Multiplication, on the other hand, is a point-wise operation that does not consider the surrounding values. It is mainly used for scalar multiplication or element-wise operations, which may not capture the spatial relationships present in the data.By using convolution, we can effectively capture spatial information and exploit the locality of features in the input space, making it especially useful in tasks like image processing, where recognizing patterns and extracting relevant features require considering the context and relationships between neighboring pixels.\n\nQ8 :  is the Wavelet decomposition used as an spatial input, or is each decomposition considered independently from one another? How are frequency components \u201cmixed\u201d across levels of decomposition?\n\nIn wavelet decomposition, the input signal is divided into different frequency bands or levels. Decomposition is done recursively, different frequency components are not mixed in each level. Instead, they are analyzed independently."

We have carefully incorporated them in the revised paper. In the following, your comments are first stated and then followed by our point-by-point responses.\n\nQ1: Can you design an experiment which will demonstrate that the improved results are indeed caused by a better analysis of tokens of different scales?\nYes, the expriments can be shown on big data, but it requires gpu. We did all our expriments with 1 gpu.\n\nQ2: What are the hyperparameters of the method? Can you perform ablation studies on them\n\nSome common hyperparameters could include the number of decomposition levels, wavelet function,  kernel size...\nYes, to perform ablation studies on these hyperparameters, one can systematically change one hyperparameter at a time while keeping the others constant."
