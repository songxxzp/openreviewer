While previous works such as [1] operate in abstract manifolds (M), our decision to fixate on the circle enabled the derivation of new, concrete closed-form formulas, as evidenced in our paper. These expressions, however, hold significance within the defined manifold and may not extend beyond its boundaries.\n\nThe utilization of the closed-form expression of alpha from [3], alongside insights from the works of Rabin et al. and Delon et al., indeed forms a foundation for certain aspects in section 2 of our paper. However, it is important to highlight that while some components build upon prior works, the framework as a whole is novel. We believe that the proposed comptuationally efficient framework could be of interest to the machine learning research community. \n\nWe also acknowledge the influence and inspiration drawn from [2] in the development of some of the concepts and tools introduced in our work. However, it's crucial to note that while [2] predominantly deals with Euclidean domains, our focus on non-Euclidean domains presents its own set of challenges and complexities. \n\n---------------------------------------------------\n[1] Sarrazin, Cl\u00e9ment, and Bernhard Schmitzer. \"Linearized optimal transport on manifolds.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.13901 (2023).\n\n[2] Wang, Wei, Dejan Slep\u010dev, Saurav Basu, John A.

Recently, the OT community addresses gained ample interest in OT metrics on non-Eculean spaces. This paper investigates OT between measures supported on the unit circle, aka circular probability measures. The paper starts with a background on circular OT by defining probability measures with 1-periodicity. This gives the CDF function with respect to a reference point. Proposition 2.3 is quite interesting since it expresses the COT between circular probability as an optimization problem on the real line by searching cutting points $x_{cut} \\in [0,1)$. Using classical optimal transport on the real line, we can construct the Monge map between data points on the circular probability measures. \n\nThis work proposes LCOT a new discrepancy between circular probability measures, allowing to embedding the origin measures by computing their Monge map with respect to a fixed reference measure (uniform or Lebesgue measure). If the cost function is the $p$-power of the absolute value, then LCOT is a proper distance and coincides with the $L_p$ norm on the unit circle endowed with the reference measure."

Probably, the result is trivial but I think it deserves to be proved.\n- As it can be seen in Figure 4, the LCOT with non-uniform reference measure is slower than the LCOT-Uniform. Is there any constant depending on the choice of the reference measure that can be added to the complexity of LCOT?\n- The experiments are conducted on simulated data, I think the application of LCOT in real data in one of the detailed domains (see Paragraph 2 in the introduction) would add more importance to this approach.

We included the proof of the uniqueness of $\\alpha_{\\mu,\\nu}$ in the Appendix. The argument is based on the paper [Delon et. al. \"Fast transport optimization for Monge costs on the circle\" SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics (2010)]. The result holds when considering absolutely continuous measures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$, and cost $h(x-y)$ with $h$ an strictly convex function. Essentially, the idea is to prove that the integral in Equation (8), view as a function of $\\alpha$, is continuous and strictly convex. Therefore, a unique global minimum is attained. Figure 8 in Appendix A.2 was meant to show this. \n\n2. To the best of our knowledge, there is no such constant related to the reference measure that can affect the complexity of LCOT, except for the sample size. The reason the uniform case is faster is that, in this case, the optimal $\\alpha_{\\mu,\\nu}$ has a closed form, allowing us to apply it directly to the computation of the embedding. For the non-uniform case, $\\alpha_{\\mu,\\nu}$ is unknown, and we must use a COT solver (e.g., the binary search algorithm in [Delon et. al. \"Fast transport optimization for Monge costs on the circle\" SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics (2010)]). The computational time for this is included in Figure 4. In other words, if we do not use the closed form of $\\alpha_{\\mu,\\nu}$ for the uniform case, the computation cost would be the same as for the non-uniform case. For other reference measures $\\mu$ there might be closed-form solutions for the minimizer $\\alpha_{\\mu,\\nu}$  that we are not aware of.\n\n3. We are not aware of the existence of such benchmarks either. However, we added an experiment on color interpolation between images in the Appendix (A.5.1) to show some non simulated data application. Also, in Appendix A.5.2, we added an application on image retrieval that requires multiple OT comparisons for each query.\n\n## Questions:\n\n### Related work\n\nMissing related work: \nThe mentioned paper ([\"The Statistics of Circular Optimal Transport\" by Hundrieser et al. 2022.]) was already cited in the manuscript and studied during our work. Please, check previous to last reference on page 10, and first line page 2.\n\n\n### Minor Typos:\n We thank the reviewer for the thorough read. We corrected all the typos. \nAs for Definition 3.2, it is in general a discrepancy (as the reviewer pointed out). Nevertheless, when $h(x)=|x|^p$ for $1<p<\\infty$ we proved that it is indeed a distance."

(7) and (9) is not obtained in the closed-form, the optimal transport on the circle does not have a closed-form solution. This work proposed its approximated variant, LCOT, such that LCOT has the closed-formued solution. Then, this work showed that in the special case, LCOT became equivalent to the original optimal transport on the circle (Remark 3.4) and evaluated the effectiveness of LCOT in the synthetic data."

We explicitate the mentioned phrase in the Appendix A.4 \"LCOT Barycenter\". We thank the reviewer for this comment since now our definition is more concise. \n\nPrecisely, the *LCOT barycenter* is defined as follows:\n\nGiven $N$ target measures $\\nu_1,\\dots,\\nu_N\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^1)$, as $LCOT_2(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is a distance, their *LCOT barycenter* is defined by the measure $\\nu_b$ such that\n$$\n    \\nu_b=argmin_{\\nu\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^1)}  \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N LCOT_2(\\nu,\\nu_j)= argmin_{\\nu\\in\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{S}^1)}  \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N ||\\widehat{\\nu}-\\widehat{\\nu_j}||^2_{L^2(\\mathbb{S}^1)}.\n$$\nIn the embedding space, it can be shown that the minimizer of \n$\n    argmin_{\\widehat{\\nu}}  \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^N ||\\widehat{\\nu}-\\widehat{\\nu_j}||^2_{L^2(\\mathbb{S}^1)}\n$\nis given by the circular mean\n$$\\overline{\\nu}(x):=\\text{circle mean}(\\{\\widehat{\\nu_1}(x),\\ldots \\widehat{\\nu_N}(x)\\}):=\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\arg\\tan\\left({\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sin(2\\pi\\widehat{\\nu_i}(x))}{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\cos(2\\pi\\widehat{\\nu_i}(x))}}\\right).  \n$$\nFor each $x\\in[0,1)$, the last value is the average of the angles ${2\\pi \\widehat{\\nu_1}(x), \\ldots, 2\\pi\\widehat{\\nu_N}(x)}$, which is then normalized to fall within the range $[-0.5, 0.5]$.\nBy using the closed formula for the inverse of the LCOT Embedding provided by Proposition 3.5, we can go back to the measure space obtaining the *LCOT barycenter* between $\\nu_1,\\dots,\\nu_N$ as \n$\\nu_b=(\\overline{\\nu}+\\mathrm{id})$#$\\mu$.\n\nIn our experiments, we use the last expression.\n\n3. We included the units (*seconds*) in the caption of Figure 4.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\n1. Consider two circular measures $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$ and the uniform circular measure as the reference $\\mu$. Calculating COT from $\\nu_i$ to $\\mu$ can be intuitively thought as finding an optimal cut on the circle for $\\nu_i$, cutting the circle into the line $[0,1)$ and then solving a one-dimensional OT problem in this flat space, which has a closed-form solution. This process allows us to find a Monge map (and the corresponding optimal displacement) between $\\nu_i$ and $\\mu$. Now, given that this mapping is invertible (i.e., for each push forward we also have a pull back), we can first push $\\nu_1$ to the reference, $\\mu$, and then pull back $\\mu$ to $\\nu_2$. This process will result in a transport map between $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$, which is unique, but is not necessarily the optimal transport map between $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$. Below, we describe this process more formally.\n\nThe LCOT-Embedding encodes the optimal circular displacement given in Equation (15). That is, a reference measure $\\mu$ is fixed and for each target measure $\\nu$, the LCOT-Embedding $\\widehat{\\nu}^{\\mu,h}(x)$ is defined as $M_\\mu^\\nu(x)-x$, where $M_\\mu^\\nu(x)$ is the optimal location to place $x$.\n\nFor simplicity in the notation, let us denote $\\widehat{\\nu}^{\\mu,h}$ by $\\widehat{\\nu}$.\n\nSince we have an optimal displacement for each $x$, we have that $\\widehat{\\nu}$ is a function. To measure the disimilarity between to target measures $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$ in the embedding space, we use a definition that allows us to use the standard $p$-norms when $h(x)=|x|^p$. The particularity here is that these distances are for functions supported on the circle which makes the formulas more convoluted. \nThe take away from Def 3.2 is that the LCOT distance between $\\nu_1$ and $\\nu_2$ is essentially a $p$-norm ($||\\widehat{\\nu}_1-\\widehat{\\nu}_2||_p$).\n\n2. In general, COT and LCOT are not equivalent distances. In Remark 3.4 we pointed out that the COT cost between $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ can be recovered by using the LCOT distance when $\\mu$ is the reference. For other pairs of measures, LCOT is still a 'transport based' distance, just not the same as COT. As a consequence, COT and LCOT barycenter are not equivalent for arbitrary sets of measures."
