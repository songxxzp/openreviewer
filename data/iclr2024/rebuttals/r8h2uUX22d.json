                        "value": "Thank you for your helpful suggestion. We especially appreciate your providing numerous references. Our response to your comments is as follows.\n\n> The authors claim that wider Mixer is a an effective expression of MLP-Mixer and RP-Mixer is a more memory-efficient alternative to unstructured sparse-weight MLP. It would be beneficial to apply wider Mixer/RP-Mixer to more state-of-the-art frameworks [1,2,3,4,5], especially considering the more efficient MLP-Mixer approach proposed in [6]\n\nand, \n\n>Q1, Q2.\n\nAs Reviewer suggests, research comparing MLP-Mixer with other Mixer variants is making significant contributions while being abundant. However, what we want to emphasize is that our objective is to elucidate **why the MLP-Mixer performs better than a naive MLP**. Therefore, our comparison is primarily with a naive MLP.\n\nThe following explanatory diagrams and comparison tables **introduce the RP-Mixer to bridge MLP and MLP-Mixer**, not to propose a superior MLP-block structure design to MLP-Mixer. As shown in the comparison table, studies like [1,2,3,4,5,6] focus on innovating the structure within blocks for inter/intra-token mixing. In contrast, the RP-Mixer, which flattens tensors and mixes them randomly, is closer to a naive  MLP.\n\n-----\n\nMLP  \u2014 ( RP-Mixer)  \u2014  MLP-Mixer   \u2014   [1,2,3,4,5,6]\n-----\nFigure.

Comparison of models on their structure.\n\nThe references [1-6] by Reviewer  experimentally reveal how modifying the mixing block can improve accuracy over the MLP Mixer. However, the fundamental question of **why a mixing block is superior to the dense layer of a naive MLP** remains a mystery. Understanding the intrinsic properties of these blocks will likely guide future improvements to Mixers, similar to references [1-6]. For instance, the equality $S=C$ is a quantitative suggestion. While Mixers with such a structure present an interesting problem, as mentioned earlier, our study's scope is to clarify the differences with a naive MLP, so we leave this for subsequent work in the future.\n\nRegarding the comparison with MLP:\n\n- In terms of efficiency, the RP-Mixer is about 10^2 to 10^3 times better than WS-MLP (Table 1 in the revised manuscript).\n- The state-of-the-art accuracy for MLP, represented by Nesybur's beta-laaso, is 85% (CIFAR10), whereas our proposed performance is 87.98% (CIFAR10), (Table 2).\n- While Scaling MLPs[Bachmann2023] achieves 56% on ImageNet with a naive MLP after various modifications, the RP-Mixer achieves 70% (ImageNet) as shown in Figure 6.\n\n[[Bachmann2023] Gregor Bachmann, et.al., Scaling MLPs: A Tale of Inductive Bias](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71680), NeurIPS2023.\n>The experimental section should include a thorough evaluation of the proposed method's performance compared to other SOTA method\n\nTo achieve our purpose, a thorough evaluation means comparing MLP with MLP/RP-Mixer across a variety of parameters, widths, and numbers of layers. We have conducted performance comparison experiments using 5000 to 10000 GPU hours, which can be considered a thorough evaluation in this context.\n\n>comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\n\nWe agree that it is one of the important contributions to improve the SOTA method. However, we expect that giving a unified perspective over existing fundamental methods (in our case, naive MLP and MLP-Mixer, that is, basic layers without additional structures mentioned in [1-6])  is also helpful in creating a solid starting point for architecture development in the future."

We updated the manuscript based on that.\n\n> My main question to the authors would be if they have any immediate applications of their findings. \n\nAs (Golubeva, Neyshabur, and Gur-Ari (2021)) suggests, **sparsity and width are two critical factors** determining the performance of DNNs, and they have significantly contributed to the development of architecture and algorithms. We have discovered that MLPmixer is a model that efficiently and memory-friendly balances both these aspects.\n\nTherefore, it has the potential for much adaptation in practice and can serve as a vessel for theoretical analysis. For instance, \n(1)**replacing the MLP block with a Mixer-block** and considering a dual-structured Mixer-block as investigated in the research of **Monarch matrices**  [1-a] seems practically useful,\n(2) and it can be utilized for **verifying generalization bounds**[1-b, 1-c] based on width and sparsity, by replacing MLPs with MLP-Mixers. Because of computational efficiency, we can evaluate them on large datasets with practical performance. \n\n(1-a)[Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/dao22a/dao22a.pdf), ICML2022\n\n(1-b)[Norm-based Generalization Bounds for Sparse Neural Networks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=COPzNA10hZ), NeurIPS2023\n\n(1-c)[Generalization Bounds of Stochastic Gradient Descent for Wide and Deep Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/cf9dc5e4e194fc21f397b4cac9cc3ae9-Paper.pdf), NeurIPS2019\n\n> What is the running time of their models compared to the original MLP Mixer formulation?\n\nWe have added not only the running time but also memory requirements and FLOPs to Table 1 in Section 4.2. As expected, **MLP-Mixer and RP-Mixer were comparable in running time, but SW-MLP was slower than them.** Furthermore, **RP-Mixer required $10^2$ ~   $10^3$ times less memory and FLOPs compared to  SW-MLP.**\n\nIn conclusion, we hope our responses have successfully clarified any uncertainties you had, and that you see the potential in our research for future developments. Your positive reassessment would be greatly appreciated and encouraging for us."

Based on your comments, we have updated the manuscripts. \n\n> Performance comparison of the MLP-Mixer with Wide MLP and RP-Mixer is missing. It would be nice to add the inference speed comparison and memory consumption comparison among the three methods (MLP-Mixer, Wide MLP, RP-Mixer).\n\nThank you for your suggestion.  We added  Table 1 to the performance comparison in Section 4.2 in the revised version.   Table 1 shows that RP-Mixer is much superior to the naive wide MLP in memory requirements,  FLOPs, and inference speed.  As we expected, MLP-Mixer is comparable to RP-Mixer and they are much better than Wide MLP.\n\n> The takeaways from this paper is a bit unclear, especially on how to properly make use of the new insights in this paper to either improve the quality or improve the performance of the existing architectures (i.e. MLP-Mixer).\n\nAs the reviewer mentioned, making improvements that significantly increase accuracy would indeed be a considerable contribution to research. However, since we are still at a stage where the reasons for the high performance of MLP-Mixer are not fully understood, providing an understanding of the mechanism where sparsity and width are crucial would be our sufficient contribution and takeaway. History has shown that contributing to the internal understanding of existing models, even when it doesn't directly lead to accuracy improvements, is considered a contribution within the community: for instance,\n\n**[Understanding Batch Normalization](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/36072923bfc3cf47745d704feb489480-Paper.pdf)  NeurIPS 2018.**\n\n**[On the relationship between self-attention and convolutional layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03584) ICLR2020.**\n\nOur focus is not primarily on improving the existing architecture of MLP-Mixer, but rather on highlighting that using MLP-Mixer is more efficient than using a naive MLP  as the following (1), (2) and (3). \n\n\n(1)Replacing fully connected layers of existing models with Mixer blocks** could lead to performance improvements due to increased effective width. As discussed in Section 3.3, this relates to the **memory-efficient matrix representation** of MLPs with Monarch matrices, which is an interesting direction. For example,  in the MLP-Mixer,  if we replace each MLP block itself with a Mixer block then we have **dual structured Mixer blocks, which enlarges the effective width and can improve performance**.    However, proposing a higher-performance architecture would be too much content for a single paper and is left as an open problem for subsequent work. \n\n(2) As shown in the Appendix, Random permutations prevent overfitting and can be used with the dual Mixer block when we want to reduce undesirable implicit bias by usual Mixing blocks.\n\n(3)MLP is the most fundamental model and has been the subject of many theoretical studies[*]. However, training MLPs to a **practical level** on **large-scale datasets** is difficult from the perspectives of memory and computational cost, making it challenging to validate theories on large datasets.\n\nThrough this research, we have discovered that the computationally efficient MLP mixer is similar to wide MLPs. This revelation **opens up the opportunity to experimentally validate previous theoretical studies on MLPs using an equivalent MLP-Mixer on large datasets!**\n\n ref: * Examples of theories and possible applications.\n-   (3.1) MLP is known to fall into the NTK regime at infinite width, as discussed in [Jacot 2018]. **By using MLP-Mixer instead,  we can observe the order of finite width where feature learning occurs relative to the number of samples.**    \n- (3.2) MLPs follow scaling laws if we prepare a  large dataset [Bachmann2023]. However, their performance was low (about acc. 50 % on ImageNet).  **Then by using the similarity of MLP-Mixer and MLP, we can observe how sparseness and wideness affect the scaling laws.** \n\n[[Jacot2018] Arthur, Jacot, et.al, Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2018/file/5a4be1fa34e62bb8a6ec6b91d2462f5a-Paper.pdf), NeurIPS2018.\n[[Bachmann2023] Gregor Bachmann, et.al., Scaling MLPs: A Tale of Inductive Bias](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/poster/71680), NeurIPS2023.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope that you can expect that our work will work as a concrete starting point for why the MLP-Mixer achieves higher performance compared to a standard MLP. \nWe hope our explanations have clarified the issues you pointed out.   If so, we would be grateful for an adjustment in the score."

Our point-to-point responses to your comments are given below.\n\n> The paper falls short in terms of the selection of networks for comparison, thereby resulting in a lack of theoretical support. \n\nThank you for your feedback. We acknowledge the concern regarding the selection of networks for comparison and the perceived lack of theoretical support.  We want to emphasize that our goal is to understand a single model, the MLP-Mixer. To achieve this, we have conducted exhaustive experiments with various parameters (about 10 selections), widths (about 50 selections), and numbers of layers (about 10 selections). In this context, we believe that the selection of networks for comparison is adequate for our purpose.\n\nAdditionally,  we note that these experiments required over a total of 5000 GPU hours. \n\n>There is a lack of experimental evidence to support the memory efficiency and lightweight structure of the RP-Mixer.\n\nThank you for your suggestions. We have added Table 1 in Section 4.2 which shows the experimental evidence of the efficiency of RP-Mixer in memory requirements, FLOPs, and runtime. This successfully verifies our claim that RP-Mxier is comparable to MLP-Mixer, and they are much better than  SW-MLP!\n\n>formula\u00a0  J_c^\\top (I_S \\otimes V)J_c = V^\\top \\otimes I_S\u00a0should actually be\u00a0 V \\otimes I_S. \n\nThank you very much for catching this confusing typo.

Could you clarify how the author's approach to analyzing network width and sparsity differs from that in Article A?\n\nTo avoid potential misunderstanding between the reviewer and us, let us emphasize that our motivation or starting point of the work is totally different from Golubeva et al 2021.\nOur motivation is to understand the mechanism of MLP-Mixer and why it works well, and it revealed that the sparsity structure of MLP-Mixer consists of the Kronecker product with the commutation matrix. In contrast, the motivation of Golubeva et al 2021 is to find the importance of sparseness in wide neural networks (in more detail, usual forward neural networks; naive MLP, and CNNs).   \nThe most interesting finding that we raised is that the seemingly different work on the sparseness by Golubeva et al 2021 has a hidden connection to the MLP-Mixer (through the Kronecker product expression). In other words, what we showed in the current work is that we can apply the same approach as in  Golubeva et al 2021 to the MLP-Mixer which is a \u201cseemingly dense\u201d network in the matrix expression but sparse in the vector expression.\n\n>  In the contribution, why is the RP-Mixer referred to as a computationally demanding yet lightly-structured alternative? \n\nThank you for catching this typo. I have corrected the term \u201cdemanding\u201d to be \u201dundemanding\u201d in the section. \n\n\n\nWe hope our responses have cleared up the uncertainties you identified, we would be grateful for an adjustment in the evaluation score."

The authors demonstrated a way to rewrite the formulation of MLP mixer into a standard MLP, where the input to the MLP is the vectored feature matrix and the wide MLP weights are constructed from the Kronecker product.\n2. The authors empirically showed that the representations obtained from the equivalent wide MLP and MLP-Mixer are similar.\n3. The authors also showed that the wide MLP resembles the Monarch matrix.\n4. The authors also tried reducing the \"structureness\" of the equivalent wide MLP's sparsity, by introducing a permutation matrix.\n5. Finally, the authors argued that an MLP mixer is a way to achieve wide MLP without the computation cost of the wide MLP, and increasing the effective width indeed improves the performance."

For example, while it's good to formalize the relationship between MLP mixer and wide MLP, it's not that unexpected. From figure 1(d), it seems like the equivalent MLP under-performs the MLP-Mixer which makes the equivalence argument weak. The random permuted mixers also don't consistently out-perform the vanilla mixer which is also a weak argument."

Based on them, we have updated the manuscript.\nOur point-to-point responses to your comments are given below.\n\n> For one, a lot of notations are not defined, which requires the reader to find out from the original MLP mixer paper. Examples are eq (1), and eq (2).\n> \n\nFollowing your suggestion, we have added an explanation of MLP-Mixer in Section 2.2.   We have added some additional captions and refined the legend in Figure 1. Furthermore, we merged  Section 3.2 to Section 5 as long as possible.\n\n> For example, while it's good to formalize the relationship between MLP mixer and wide MLP, it's not that unexpected\n> \n\nAs far as the authors know,  there is no literature that reveals any relationship between MLP-Mixer and standard MLP. Certainly, the transformation of the equation is simple, but we believe that being simple does not mean it lacks novelty.\n\n> From Figure 1(d), it seems like the equivalent MLP under-performs the MLP-Mixer which makes the equivalence argument weak.\n> \n\nIt seems that our insufficient explanation might cause a misunderstanding of the purpose of Fig. 1(d).  The purpose is to understand  MLP-Mixer\u2019s performance tendency based on width.  What we pointed out from Fig1(d) are the following two understandings:  \n\n(1) MLP-Mixer has the same properties as a standard MLP at usual widths,\n\n(2) MLP-Mixer overcomes the disadvantage of MLPs that occur at extremely large widths. The disadvantage, reported by (Golveba et al., 2021), is from the eigenvalue distribution of weight matrices. This discussion is mathematically intricate, so it was delegated to the Appendix. Moreover, we add an explanation of the eigenvalue distribution in Section 4.2. \n\nIn conclusion, we believe that an understanding of MLP-Mixer can be achieved by distinguishing between its similarities and slight differences from standard MLPs in Fig1(d).\n\nFurthermore, to emphasize the similarity in the usual width,  we have added the performance comparison for small width into Fig1(d).  The results make it more clearly show the similarity between MLP-Mixer and MLP in usual widths.\n\n> The random permuted mixers also don't consistently out-perform the vanilla mixer which is also a weak argument.  \n& \nDo you have an explanation on why RP-Mixers are not consistently better than normal mixers?\n> \n\nOur insufficient explanation seems to have caused the reviewer\u2019s confusion.  Our goal is to create an equivalent model with consistent performance, **essentially revealing that the performance of the Mixer is controlled by its width and sparseness.**  Therefore, RP-Mixer does *not* need to overcome the vanilla mixer. \n\nLet us also emphasize that RP-Mixer is not necessarily better than MLP-Mixer when the depth is limited. This is because random permutations break the structure for sharing tokens between mixing blocks. If we have a sufficiently large depth, we can overcome this decrease of performance as is confirmed in Figure 6.\n\n> the\u00a0 vec(X)\u00a0in eq(4) should be\u00a0vec(WX)\u00a0and\u00a0vec(XV)?\n> \n\nThe equation represents maps and vec(X) represents the source element of the map.  However,  as the Reviewer said it may be not easy to follow, so we have rewritten it into matrix form in the revised version. Thank you for your suggestion. \n\nIf our replies have resolved the unclear points you raised, we would greatly appreciate a re-evaluation of the score."
