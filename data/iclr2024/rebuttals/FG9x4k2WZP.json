What is distillation first, and what is conditioning finetuning first? What are their differences?\n\n- In Fig. 1, the authors include some qualitative examples from the proposed distillation method. Since the diffusion field is getting very crowded and every paper submission shows good qualitative results in the teaser figure, it is more helpful for authors to include a comparison with other existing distillation methods, instead of just showing a few examples of the proposed method (in other words, Fig.1 is not very informative).\n\n- A side note on the claim ``These two procedures offer different advantages in terms of cross-task flexibility and learning difficulty, but their generated results are generally better than those of the undistilled conditional diffusion model when given the same sampling time\u2019\u2019, I don\u2019t think it is a fair comparison, and of course, the distilled conditional model should perform better than undistilled ones given the same sampling time, this is what distillation methods designed for?\n\n- I also had a difficult time seeing the connections between the presented background and the scope of this paper. Or I guess another way to put my question is: why Eq. (1) - (8) should be included in the main paper?\n\n- Why T2I models such as StableDiffusion and Imagen are considered unconditional models as stated in footnote 2?\n\n- Is $\\mu$ in Eq. (10) a learnable parameter? But has not been discussed in main experiments or ablation studies?\n\n- A suggestion on Fig.2, I think the current Fig.2 is too small to read as this is your main methodology figure\u2026\n\n- The computational resources and the time cost are not reported and discussed?\n\n- Many references in this manuscript have the format of their ArXiv version (such as [a] [b] [c]), while this is a minor suggestion, I believe it should be the authors\u2019 responsibility to update the bibliography with their final publication venues. \n\n[a] Denoising diffusion implicit models. \n\n[b] Score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equations. \n\n[c] Sdedit: Guided image synthesis and editing with stochastic differential equations."

It would be important to also show some quantitative results on a second task. For instance, CLIP similarity between original and edited images and CLIP similarity between the editing caption and the edited image. FID on a depth-to-image dataset could also help. \n\n- The related works section could be a bit clearer. There needs to be a grouping of the previous methods (full inference vs step-by-step distillation for example) to contrast between the different approaches and help understand where the proposed approach stands. In its current form, it is difficult to understand what the advantages/disadvantages of existing works are and where the authors aim to make a contribution."

The paper describes the guidance as analogous to the classical denoising score matching loss found in diffusion models, where the ideal model predicts the average of all possible noiseless images that could have led to the given noisy image. However, the consistency loss term aims for a model that predicts a singular clean image for a noisy input, as directed by the probability flow ODE trajectories. These objectives seem to conflict with each other.\n\n- The justification for the improved performance due to the partial real-value predictor is not clear. Despite its practical effectiveness, the paper does not provide a convincing explanation for why this adjustment is beneficial.\n\nExperimentally, there are several issues:\n\n- The ablation study lacks a critical comparison. It does not include a baseline where an unconditional diffusion model is first refined using the suggested efficient architectural changes, followed by either consistency distillation or progressive distillation. It would be valuable to determine if the proposed method would outperform these conventional baselines under the same computational constraints. Comparing to a model initiated with random parameters does not provide a relevant benchmark.\n\n- There is a methodological problem with the ablation experiment regarding conditional guidance. It is uncertain how the model learns to condition on $c$ when $r=0$. It would seem necessary to train a conditional diffusion model initially to generate accurate data points for minimizing the self-consistency loss.\n\n- The results presented in Table 1 for CM and GD raise questions. It is confusing how these distillation techniques do not show a marked improvement over quick sampler methods that do not require training, such as DPM Solver and DPM Solver++."
