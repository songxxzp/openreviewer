                    "value": "The authors propose to solve a task of ODE discovery in the treatment effect estimation setting. Although the task is not sufficiently explained in the main paper, I believe it is to construct an ODE model with simple expressions (e.g., log, exp, sin) from time series data at continuous time stamps. Thus, the paper seems to tackle a novel task. However, it is completely unclear because the motivation is not sufficiently described, the paper is not well structured, the problem setting is not clearly presented, and many important descriptions are moved to Appendix."

                    "value": "(A) Problem setting is unclear\n\n- First of all, in Section 1, please clearly state that what the ODE discovery task is and what its goal is. Otherwise, the readers cannot understand why it yields interpretability. \n\n- It is unclear whether time $t$ is defined as continuous or discrete. For instance, in Section 2, \u201cat $t \\in [T]$\u201d seems to say that the value of time $t$ is discrete and it is included in index set $[T]$. However, for example in Assumption 2.2, \u201ctime point $t \\in [0, T]$\u201d seems to say that it is continuous.\n\n- In Section 3, \u201cwe assume that time-varying features and outcomes \u2026 are discrete measurements of underlying continuous trajectories\u2026\u201d is unclear. I could not understand what is discrete and what is continuous. Do you imply that trajectories are defined at continuous time and their observations are measured at discrete time? Or do you mean that the values of features and outcomes are continuous in ODE models, but their observed values are discrete? Similarly, \u201cdiscrete (or continuous) treatment plan\u201d is unclear to me. This makes the paper extremely difficult to follow.\n\n- Eq. (3) introduces function $g$, and the authors say \u201cit is known and is often assumed to be the identity.\u201d Why? \n\n- Please separate the paragraph at \u201cThe goal of ODE discovery is \u2026\u201d in Section 3. Please do not mix the proposed problem setting and the existing one in the same paragraph, which is hard to follow.\n\n\n(B) The technical soundness is unclear\n\n- **Assumptions**: I could not understand why the authors say that \u201cAssumption 2.2 can be relaxed with Assumptions 3.1 and 3.3.\u201d  I could not see what the point of Discrepancy 1 is. It simply says that \u201cthe assumptions in treatment effect estimation do not correspond one-to-one to those in ODE discovery,\u201d which seems trivial. It is hard to follow.\n \n- **The soundness of employing ODE discovery methods**: Although the proposed method employs the existing ODE discovery method (called SINDy), it is unclear what this method does and how it works. What is the advantages and the limitations of this method? How can we choose the existing methods? \n\n- **Ability to express the variability of each subject**: The authors seem to simply change the constant values in simple ODE models to express the variability across subjects. Can we really always express the treatment and the outcome curves with such a simple strategy, given that the continuous time series data often involve complex dynamics?\n\n(C) The difference from existing ODE-based treatment effect estimation methods is unclear in the main paper\n\n- Please briefly summarize the description of \u201cDynamical systems, ODEs, and treatment effects\u201d in Appendix B.1 in the main paper. This will make the motivation of this paper clearer."

To facilitate further discussion, we have also stated how each specific comment changed our paper_\n\n\n**(A) Problem setting.** Thank you for highlighting areas where our problem setting needed clarification. We have made the following revisions:\n\n1. In Section 1, we now explicitly define the goal of ODE discovery as \"finding underlying closed-form concise ODEs from observed trajectories,\" clarifying how these transparent equations lead to interpretability.\n\n2. To clarify the nature of time in our model, Section 2 has been updated to specify time as a continuous variable, represented as $ t \\in [0, T] $, to eliminate any confusion. We also clarify explicitly that $T$ is the time horizon.\n\n3. In Section 3, we have refined our explanation: trajectories are indeed defined in continuous time, while observations are made at discrete time points (at possibly varying intervals). We also clarified the concept of \"discrete (or continuous) treatment plan\" in relation to the set of allowed treatments $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n4. The role of $g$ in Eq. (3) is to describe the treatment outcome as a function of the observed features. Thus, knowing $g$ is the same as just specifying the outcome variable. It is often assumed to correspond to one of the features, e.g., the tumor volume. We have clarified this point. For a detailed discussion about Eq. (3), please take a look at Appendix C.\n\n5. We have separated the paragraphs in Section 3 to distinctly delineate our proposed problem setting from existing ones, enhancing readability.\n\nThese revisions aim to make the problem setting clearer and the paper easier to follow.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** Revisions 1-5 (outlined above) are applied to our paper.\n\n\n`rebuttal continues in next comment...`"

We have now corrected this by highlighting only the text changed during the author discussion period, compared to the original submission (Sep 28). These changes can be verified using the OpenReview pdf difference tool. We find our changes to the paper to be minimal, and inline with addressing the reviewers comments\u2014to be comprehensive we list out **all** these changes below, and their type:\n\n* Abstract: _Clarified_ ODE discovery methods discover an equation, by changing \"human-readable equation\" to \"equation\".\n* Introduction: _Clarified_ the goal of ODE discovery with the addition of \u201cthe goal of ODE discovery is finding underlying closed-form concise ODEs from observed trajectories.\u201d\n* Introduction: _Clarified_ ODE discovery methods discover an equation, by changing \"human-readable equation\" to \"equation\".\n* Introduction: _Clarified_ contribution using ODE discovery methods by \u201cWhile other TE inference methods have used ideas from ODE literature, none have focused on ODE discovery, we have devoted appendix B.1 to explain this subtle but important difference.\u201d\n* Section 2. _Clarified_ time to be continuous \u201c$t \\in [0,T]$, with $T$ the time horizon\u201d.\n* Section 3. Renamed section to \u201cUnderpinnings of ODE discovery\u201d\n* Section 3. Added additional _clarification_ and example of how and where ODEs are used by \u201cThere are many fields which already use ODEs as a formal language to express time dynamics. One such example is pharmacology, where a large portion of literature is dedicated to recover an ODE from observational data. The found ODE is then used to reason about possible treatments and disease progression (Geng et al., 2017; Butner et al., 2020).\u201d\n* Section 3. _Clarified_ $g$ as \u201c$g$ is prespecified by the user and often models the outcome as one of the features ($g(\\mathbf{x}) = x_j$), e.g., the tumor volume.\u201d\n* Section 3. _Clarified_ ODE trajectories by \u201cOf course, the reliance on such a dataset implies that, while the trajectories are defined in continuous time, they are observed in discrete time\u201d.\n* Section 4.1. _Clarified_ the four different treatment types by \u201cIn summary, there are 4 different treatment types: binary, categorical, multiple, and continuous treatments (Bica et al., 2020). Each of them can be a static or dynamic treatment, which are either constant or change during a trajectory, respectively. This results in 8 scenarios, which we model in two ways: either the ODE changes for each treatment option; or the treatment is part of the starting condition. These are all outlined in table 6 in appendix D.\u201d\n* Section 7. _Added_ a future work of \u201clearning piece-wise continuous ODE systems (Wang et al., 2023)\u201d\n* Ethics statement. _Clarified_ the limitations with listing three limitations that a user should take into account before using the method in practice.\n* _New appendix J.7_ on empirical results to show that \u201cINSITE also empirically works for irregularly sampled data\u201d.\n* _New appendix J.8_ on empirical results to show that \u201cINSITE can also work with more challenging observation functions $g(x)$\u201d.\n* _New appendix M_ on \u201cHow to choose an ODE discovery method\u201d.\n* _New appendix N_ on \u201cNumerical Solver and Parameters\u201d\n\nIn summary the total changes to the paper during the author rebuttal discussion period are only _additional clarification changes_ or the _addition of additional empirical results for special settings_. Each change directly addresses feedback from the review process, enhancing the paper\u2019s clarity, depth, and practical relevance. We assure you that the core arguments, methodology, and results remain unchanged. The fundamental nature and validity of our work have not been altered; rather, the paper has been refined to better communicate its value.\n\nAs the author discussion period draws to a close, we remain open and responsive to any further questions or concerns. Your feedback has been invaluable, and we are committed to addressing any remaining issues promptly.\n\nWe hope this clarifies your concern and you will kindly consider accepting the paper. Thank you once again for your invaluable insights and the opportunity to improve our manuscript.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPaper 5372 authors"

To facilitate further discussion, we have also stated how each specific comment changed our paper_\n\n**Learning ODEs.** You are correct. ODE learning is an incredibly challenging task and, in certain scenarios, infeasible. For these scenarios, we recommend a practitioner rely on the tried-and-tested pure inference machines for treatment effects inference (such as those built on top of neural networks or random forests and beyond).\n\nHowever, there are also multiple scenarios where ODE learning actually _is_ feasible, and moreover- **_preferred_**. These scenarios include pharmacology, physics, and even economics. The reason is that existing literature on these topics (outside of machine learning) is already heavily driven by the need to discover and recover underlying ODE systems. \n\n**_Actions taken:_** We include pharmacology as an example in Section 3 to further emphasize where ODE discovery makes sense. We also explicitly list the limitations associated with INSITE (and our general framework) in our ethics statement. Hopefully, guiding a practitioner on when (and when not) to use our ODE-learner-based approach to TE inference.\n\n\n**Learning feature libraries.** Setting a good feature library requires two important considerations:\n\n1. Which ODE method are we using?\n2. In which scenario are we applying the method?\n\nFor 1, we have included a new Appendix M, which explains SINDy (our underlying ODE learner) in detail, as well as points the interested reader to alternative ODE learners, should SINDy be insufficient (wrt to feature sets or other reasons). \n\nFor 2, our method heavily relies on domain knowledge. We believe domain knowledge should, of course, take into account point 1 when making a decision on the ODE learner. While this could be problematic, the same is also true for _any_ ML method to be applied in practice. \n\n**_Actions taken:_** We include Appendix M, which explains, in detail, SINDy and provides alternatives.\n\n**_We thank the reviewer once more for their insightful and positive review. We believe our paper is improved as a direct result of your comments. Should there be any more questions, please ask._**"

The presentation of this paper, such as the related work, should be further improved before acceptance. e.g., the $T$ appears at section 2 but is introduced in section 3 (\"is called the time horizon\"). Another example is ODE discovery paragraph in B.1; I didn't understand why RNN and LSTM are considered ODE discovery methods.\n\n2. Compared to existing black-box TE methods (like neural-network based architectures), the authors claim that the main contribution of this work is a human-readable, interpretable framework. But if the current form of the manuscript only offers empirical validation, I feel that its contributions might not yet meet the threshold of ICLR conf. I wonder that have authors investigated the inherent theoretical properties of the ODE-based framework (which is a white-box model compared to deep network)? e.g., for certain nonlinear differential equations, the solution might be chaotic, meaning it's highly sensitive to initial conditions $\\boldsymbol{x}_0, \\boldsymbol{v}$ and treatment plan $\\boldsymbol{a}$ at $t_0$. \n\n3. Given the claimed emphasis on 'human-readability', how does the proposed method facilitate better decision-making or insights for practitioners in the field is still unclear. Addressing these concerns with more discussions on closed-form ODE would further enhance this work.\n\n4. Minor issues don't affect the rating:\n\n- page 8: $\\gamma = 0$ corresponds no time-dependent -> add 'to' for consistency\n\n- Table 5: word 'Intrepetible' -> 'Interpretable'\n\n- there's one paragraph exceeds the 9 pages limit of the main body\n\n- the full name of ODE/ODEs appears many times in the text, which seems unnecessary"

As time changes, different patterns of $\\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ may emerge over the interval from $t_0$ to $T$.\n\n- In practice, what method do you use for solving ODEs? How about the complexity of gradient query / solving for this numerical system? Is your method faster than the neural network-based approaches?"

To facilitate further discussion, we have also stated how each specific comment changed our paper_\n\n**1. Presentation of the paper.** Thank you for pointing us to these necessary corrections. We have taken the following steps in our revision to address your concerns:\n\n1. _On $T$:_ We have revised the paper to introduce the concept of the time horizon earlier in Section 2.\n2. _On RNNs and LSTMs for ODE discovery:_ In Appendix B.1, we have amended the text to replace references to RNN and LSTM with a more accurate discussion of Neural ODEs. This modification provides clarity on our approach and aligns better with the context of ODE discovery.\n\nWe believe these changes enhance the overall presentation and coherence of the paper, and we hope that they address your concerns effectively.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** Adjusted the paper where necessary to incorporate the above suggestions.\n\n\n**2. Theoretical Contributions.** Our main contribution lies in creating a _usable framework_ that translates ODE discovery methods into the treatment effects problem formulation, bridging two previously distinct fields. \n\nOur theoretical contribution is the alignment of two utterly different problem formulations and assumptions between treatment effects inference and ODE discovery. As shown in Figure 2, ODE discovery methods only work out of the box in the simplest settings (i.e., continuous treatments and only one kind of between-subject variability (BSV) corresponding to a noisy measurement). We demonstrate how to extend ODE discovery methods to allow for discrete treatment plans (both dynamic and static) and two additional sources of BSV: covariate models and parameter distributions (BSV levels C and D). Identification of these two dimensions (axes in Figure 2) and subsequent reconciliation of discrepancies (as shown in Section 4) constitute a major theoretical milestone.\n\nWhile the theoretical properties of ODE discovery are not the central focus of this work, we acknowledge their importance and direct readers to references A and B for foundational background in this area.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** We have included references [A] and [B] in the main text of our paper, referring the interested reader to the many theoretical underpinnings of ODE discovery.\n\n**3. Facilitating decision-making and insight.** We have included Appendix I, where we demonstrate that our framework, INSITE, successfully identifies equations that are not only predictive but also closely resemble or exactly match the true underlying equations, facilitating further analyses, such as stability analysis, impact analysis, and optimal treatment analysis.\n\nAs we have now elaborated in Section 3, many fields already use ODEs as a formal language to express time dynamics. One such example is pharmacology, where a large portion of the literature is dedicated to recovering an ODE from observational data. The found ODE is then used to reason about possible treatments and disease progression ([D],[E]).\n\nFurthermore, in Section 6.1, we illustrate that our method remains effective even when the common overlap assumption is not met. This aspect of INSITE enhances decision-making in complex scenarios where traditional assumptions may not hold.\n\n\n**4. Corrections:** Thank you for pointing us to these errors; they have now been implemented. We kindly note that the ethics and reproducibility statement do not count toward the page limit, as per the official ICLR author guide instructions: https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide.\n\n`rebuttal continues in next comment...`"

However, we acknowledge that this term might have been ambiguous without a detailed explanation. Thus, we have revised the manuscript, replacing 'human-readable equation' with 'equation' in the abstract and introduction to avoid any misunderstanding\u2014therefore, this term does not appear in the paper anymore.\n\nConcerning your valuable insights on numerical problems and solver details, we have now added an additional **(new) appendix N** titled \u201cNumerical Solver and Parameters\u201d, which details in one place the following.\n\nThe numerical method (solver) used for INSITE and the other ODE discovery methods (e.g., SINDy) is that of the **Euler method**, which is a first-order numerical algorithm for solving ODEs given an initial value. This uses a time step size of $\\delta_t = 0.166$ seconds, which was sufficient for our experiments. This numerical method is used with the same settings across all methods, including INSITE. We kindly note that first, the ODE discovery methods discover an ODE, and then at inference time, when we wish to determine future values, we forward simulate the initial observed value using the discovered ODE and this Euler numerical solver to estimate future values at future times. We also kindly highlight further implementation details can be found in appendices E, F and H.\n\nAs the author discussion period draws to a close, we remain open and responsive to any further questions or concerns. Your feedback has been invaluable, and we are committed to addressing any remaining issues promptly.\n\nWe hope this clarifies your concern and you will kindly consider accepting the paper. Thank you once again for your invaluable insights and the opportunity to improve our manuscript.\n\nKind regards,\n\nPaper 5372 authors"

This potentially opens up a new paradigm of treatment effect estimation methods that does not rely on neural network. The ODE approach naturally offers interpretability and requires slightly different assumptions for identification. The authors first discussed the difference and similarities between longitudal treatment effect estimation and ODE, then proposed a framework for bridging the problem and solution. The proposed framework is then compared with several neural network based longitudal effect estimators."

                        "value": "_We thank the reviewer for their time and helpful comments. Our rebuttal below follows the structure of your review. To facilitate further discussion, we have also stated how each specific comment changed our paper_\n\n\n**1. Identification.** When the complete causal system is known (including the underlying structural equations), one can use the causal system to solve problems such as counterfactual regression, _without_ resorting to regression techniques. Chapter 3.4. \"Counterfactual analysis in structural model\" in Pearl (2009) [A], makes this point explicitly. There, a counterfactual query is resolved using the complete causal system (being the causal graph and structural equations). \n\n\nOf course, most practical scenarios do not have access to the full causal system. Performing counterfactual regression in these settings then relied on regression strategies, which are only approximate. Using regression techniques to perform counterfactual regression then requires at least some proof of identification. The burden of proof is only necessary because we cannot access the complete causal system. \n\n\nIn our setting, we actually learn the _complete causal system_ (including the structural equations). Papers proposing ODE learners claim to recover the true underlying ODE. If there is such one true underlying equation (cfr. Assumption 3.1), then it is only logical that this equation corresponds to the one true underlying (causal) structural equation. Hence, by learning the true ODE, one has access to the full causal system, which in turn alleviates the need for an identification proof. \n\nOf course, the accuracy and identification guarantees in our setting (above) are only as strong as those provided by the underlying ODE learner. In case one uses a faulty ODE learner (with, for example, poor guarantees), INSITE would suffer as a result. In this case, our framework is at least explicit about which assumptions and settings one can rely on ODE discovery for TE inference.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** We include Appendix M, which explains which identification guarantees (and under which necessary assumptions) SINDy (our example underlying ODE learner) provides. Furthermore, Appendix M also includes alternative ODE learners, in case SINDy is unsuitable for the practical setting at hand.\n\n\n**2. Experiments.** Note that we adopt the experimental settings from the related literature on ODE discovery. While in TE literature, it is common to rely on semi-synthetic data, truly testing our method requires more than just access to the unobserved potential outcome (which is the reason TE literature resorts to semi-synthetic testbeds). Specifically, we also require access to the underlying causal system, which is only possible with fully synthetic data. \n\nWe also kindly refer to Appendix J, which includes many more experiments that may interest the reviewer. In particular, we included experiments on:\n* Sensitivity on $\\lambda$\n* Parametric distributions of numeric constants\n* Varying sample sizes and higher noise\n* Model misspecification\n\n\n**_We thank the reviewer once more for their insightful and positive review. We believe our paper is improved as a direct result of your comments. Should there be any more questions, please ask._**\n\n\n## References\n\n[A] Judea Pearl. _Causal inference in statistics: An overview._ 2009."

                        "value": "_We thank the reviewer for their time and helpful comments. Our rebuttal below follows the structure of your review. To facilitate further discussion, we have also stated how each specific comment changed our paper_\n\n**Limitations.** We agree with the reviewer, limitations should be clearly stated:\n1. A correct set of candidate functions (tokens) is necessary for correct model recovery. To show the importance of this, we include experiments where we have wrongly specified this token library (see Appendix J.6) and observe degrading performance as a result. We will explicitly refer to Appendix J.6 from our concluding section.\n\n2. Sparsity is an assumption stemming from the type of function we wish to recover. Only when the function is sparse (that is, it contains not too many terms) can we deem it interpretable. There is nothing technical that limits INSITE (or the underlying SINDy method) to sparse functions; however, relaxing sparsity would also result in less useful recovered equations.\n\n3. ODEs are noise-free. Since we recover ODEs, we therefore recover noiseless (deterministic) functions. In case one is interested in stochastic differential equations (SDEs), one needs to extend our work to encompass this type of differential equation. \n\n\n**_Actions taken:_** The above limitations (1-3) are now stated in our ethics statement. We include it there as it should be considered explicitly before applying our method (and framework) in practical settings.\n\n\n**Treatment systems.** For a complete description of incorporating different treatment types, we refer to Appendix D. Due to the extent of our discussion, we moved this to our supplementary materials. In particular, Table 6 (in Appendix D) shows how a non-continuous treatment is transformed into a dynamical system. However, on page 5, we have included a brief description of the table presented in Appendix D.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** Include a summary of Table 6 in Appendix D in the main text.\n\n\n**Experiments.** The underlying method SINDy implemented supports irregularly sampled time series data [B, C], therefore INSITE also supports learning ODEs from irregularly sampled time series. For the function introduced in Eq. (3) and its common assumption as the identity function, please refer to related works [A] for a detailed background.\n\n**_Actions taken:_** Included a new Appendix M to detail SINDy and other ODE discovery learners. We will also provide, before the end of the discussion period (due to high running times), a set of experiments on irregular sampling and alternative functions $g(x)$. \n\n## Questions\n\n**BSV scenario A.** We agree that for the BSV scenario A (eq.5 and eq.6), we expect ODE discovery methods to perform as well as INSITE. This discrepancy could likely occur due to the accuracy to which the parameters are optimized internally within the SINDy method. We observe that an alternative optimization method that is more accurate than that of WSINDy (Messenger et al., 2021) achieves a better performance than SINDy. Whereas INSITE fine-tunes the ODEs parameters to the initially observed trajectory of a patient at inference time using a higher-accuracy optimization method of the Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, a second-order nonlinear optimization method.\n\n**INSITE and $\\gamma$.** We agree that INSITE's error is monotonically increasing with $\\gamma$. However, we note that it still achieves a more accurate prediction compared to existing methods.\n\nThe fact that INSITE's error increases with $\\gamma$ is also expected. As $\\gamma$ increases, overlap gets more violated. While INSITE is _more robust_ against overlap violations, it is not immune. The reason is that the hypothesis space associated with ODEs is still large enough that we cannot confidently extrapolate to low-sample regions (such as regions of low/non-overlap). On the other hand, the ODE hypothesis space is still smaller than the neural networks used in other TE inference techniques.\n\n\n**_We thank the reviewer once more for their insightful and positive review. We believe our paper is improved as a direct result of your comments. Should there be any more questions, please ask._**\n\n## References\n\n[A] Edward L Ince. Ordinary differential equations.
