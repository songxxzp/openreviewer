                    "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of non-robust performance in semi-supervised learning (SSL) due to inconsistencies between labeled and unlabeled data, especially in open environments with different data sources. The authors introduce the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC) and related metrics, reshaping the framework for robust SSL to achieve global robustness rather than just local robustness. They evaluate a variety of statistical and deep SSL algorithms across diverse datasets (tabular, image, and text) in three open environment scenarios: inconsistent data distributions, label spaces, and feature spaces, providing a comprehensive benchmark and detailed analysis to enhance the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments."

The authors emphasize the challenges posed by inconsistencies between labeled and unlabeled data in open environments. They have set a strong foundation for the study, making it easier for readers to understand the significance of the work and the potential impact it could have in advancing the field of robust machine learning. \n2. Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation: The manuscript stands out in its thorough and well-structured experimental evaluation. The authors have gone to great lengths to ensure that the performance of various statistical and deep SSL algorithms is rigorously assessed across a wide range of datasets, including tabular, image, and text data. The inclusion of three distinct open environment scenarios (inconsistent data distributions, label spaces, and feature spaces) adds depth to the evaluation, ensuring that the results are comprehensive and reliable. The meticulous design of the experiments and the extensive coverage of different scenarios demonstrate a commitment to empirical rigor, which significantly enhances the credibility and value of the research findings.\n3. Solid Theoretical Foundation: The strength of the manuscript is further augmented by its robust theoretical framework. The introduction of the Robustness Analysis Curve (RAC) and the associated metrics offers a novel perspective to approach the problem of robustness in SSL. The detailed theoretical analysis provided in the paper not only supports the empirical findings but also offers deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the robustness of SSL algorithms in open environments. This solid theoretical grounding ensures that the contributions of the manuscript are not just empirical but also provide a conceptual advancement in the understanding of robust SSL."

The author could provide a detailed example to help readers better understand the meaning and function of 't'.\n2. The robust semi-supervised learning referred to in the manuscript actually mainly pertains to safe semi-supervised learning. Perhaps utilizing the term \"safe semi-supervised learning\" would be more suitable and precise in this context.\n3. In Figure 2, there are too many methods presented, making it difficult to read. It would be sufficient to showcase a comparison of some representative methods instead.\n4. The manuscript introduces numerous evaluation metrics; however, the inherent relationships among these metrics are not very clear. The individual motivations for proposing each of these metrics could be further elucidated."

In this rebuttal, we respond to the concerns raised in the reviews.\n\nRegarding the weakness 1. Thank you for your suggestion. In the revised version, we have added illustrative examples for the variable 't'. Please refer to the third line on the second page.\n\nRegarding the weakness 2. Indeed, there is a high degree of overlap between algorithms defined under these two definitions. Safe semi-supervised learning imposes stricter requirements compared to robust semi-supervised learning (i.e., it cannot be weaker than the baseline that only uses labeled data for supervised learning). Given that many of the algorithms we compared cannot achieve a safe level in various environments, we opted for robust semi-supervised learning, which provides a broader description.\n\nRegarding the weakness 3. Thank you for your suggestion. We have addressed our formatting issues in the new version.\n\nRegarding the weakness 4. We discussed the motivation for each metric at the end of the third section of the paper. In the revised version, we have further supplemented the introduction of motivations.\n\nRegarding the question. This is a good question, and we appreciate the insight you provided. In fact, in scenarios where multiple inconsistencies exist, a variable 't' can only be used when the degrees of inconsistency are the same. For situations with varying degrees of inconsistency, we just need to set multiple corresponding variables 't'. In such cases, the theory will still hold by some simple variable substitutions.\n\nMany thanks."

In this rebuttal, we respond to the concerns raised in the reviews.\n\nRegarding the question 1. It is possible to rank algorithms based on any metric, but the obtained results only represent a specific aspect. For instance, the algorithm with the best average accuracy, the one with the best worst-case accuracy, or the one with the smallest performance variation. In practical applications, it is essential to establish ranking criteria according to the user's requirements for the algorithm. If necessary, comparisons can also involve weighted considerations for different metrics. We summarized the robustness performance of the compared algorithms in Tables 3 and 4. However, these rankings based on metrics only capture a partial aspect of the algorithm's characteristics.\n\nRegarding the weaknesses 1. Thank you very much for your suggestions. We will address formatting issues in the revised version of the paper, addressing the concerns of excessive text in the main body.\n\nRegarding the weaknesses 2. Due to the numerous symbols needed to describe the theorems within the theoretical framework, we currently lack sufficient space in the main text to introduce them. Therefore, we had to place the theorems in the appendix. If there is an opportunity in the future to submit a camera-ready version (with an additional page), we will consider your suggestions.\n\nMany thanks."

In this rebuttal, we respond to the concerns raised in the reviews.\n\nRegarding the question. In practical applications, specific metrics may be necessary to quantify inconsistencies. Considering the scenario where all unlabeled samples are inconsistent samples: in the case of inconsistency in data distributions, the degree of inconsistency can be directly measured by numerous metrics in the field of transfer learning such as $\\mathcal{H}\\Delta\\mathcal{H}$ distance; in the case of inconsistency in label or feature spaces, the degree of inconsistency can be directly measured by the proportion of shared classes or features between labeled and unlabeled data compared to the total number of classes or features. Considering the scenario where unlabeled samples containing not only inconsistent samples but also consistent samples: the proportion of inconsistent samples can also be used as the metric to measure the inconsistency. In the end, these inconsistency metrics can be normalized and linked to the variable 't'. \n\nRegarding the weakness. Indeed, evaluation complexity rises with the environment's complexity. In complex environments, we must strike a balance between high precision and low complexity in evaluations.\n\nMany thanks."
