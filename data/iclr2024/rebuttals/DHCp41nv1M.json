                    "value": "The key issue and the reason I chose a rating of 2 for the presentation is the lack of contextualization for this work. While the authors do a good job comparing to some baselines like a TV method and a 2D approach the problem of seeing through scattering media has a long history, which this paper largely ignores. This problem arises in the context of de-hazing and underwater imaging (see e.g. Akkaynak et al and Berman et al below ). I also point out that the inverse problem is very similar to the DiffuserCam proposed by Antipa et al. Further works by Satat et al. Bar et al. Alterman et al. all looked into seeing through scattering and Bar et al. offer a simple model for speckle formation. Lastly, the discussion on speckles seem redundant as the paper reduces the model to a simple convolution with a gaussian kernel. This opens the discussion to a whole host of works done on blind and non-blind deconvolution. \n\nThe other major issue I have is that all the results and experiments assume a simple convolution model to generate data and then show the recovery based on that model. This means that there is no model mismatch at all. I would like the authors to expand on that.\n\nA minor point: the paper alternates between a differentiable model and a closed form model, which do not overlap. One can have a differential scattering-based model (e.g. Nimier-David, Merlin, et al. \"Mitsuba 2: A retargetable forward and inverse renderer.\" ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG) 38.6 (2019): 1-17.) that is nonetheless a non-closed form model.\n\nSome relevant work that should be acknowledged and contextualized:\nSatat, Guy, Matthew Tancik, and Ramesh Raskar. \"Towards photography through realistic fog.\" 2018 IEEE International Conference on Computational Photography (ICCP).

                        "value": "Thanks for the careful reading and for your detailed feedback. Please see the detailed response below.\n\n> **W1**. The key issue and the reason I chose a rating of 2 for the presentation is the lack of contextualization for this work. While the authors do a good job comparing to some baselines like a TV method and a 2D approach the problem of seeing through scattering media has a long history, which this paper largely ignores. This problem arises in the **(1) context of de-hazing and underwater imaging**. \nI also point out that the inverse problem is very similar to the **(2) DiffuserCam**. **(3) Further works by Satat et al. Bar et al. Alterman et al. all looked into seeing through scattering and Bar et al. offer a simple model for speckle formation**. \nLastly, the **(4) discussion on speckles seem redundant** as the paper reduces the model to a simple convolution with a gaussian kernel. This opens the discussion to a whole host of works done on blind and non-blind deconvolution.\n\nPlease see General Comment 2 & 3. \n\nDiffuserCam has not been mentioned in General Comment 2, so we will provide following response here. We started the derivation by substituting z=0 to derive a Gaussian blur kernel. We emphasize that the distance from the imaging plane from the output plane of scattering media can be non-invasively controlled (e.g. Imaging right in front of the skin). If this **distance becomes large**, it can be considered similar to the case of a DiffuserCam, leading to a speckle PSF rather than a Gaussian psf.\n\nIn DiffuserCam, they used this speckle PSF for compressed sensing encoding of 3D information, which has significance. However, due to the Memory effect, the forward model has a significant limitation with a hard limit on the field of view. Therefore, the speckle PSF is unknown without the speckle pattern calibration according to various distances(not applicable to an unseen diffuser), and the object must be spatially incoherent amplitude target. In this point of view, our forward model does not require any calibration to applicate to an unseen diffuser.\n\n> **W2**. The other major issue I have is that all the results and experiments assume a simple convolution model to generate data and then show the recovery based on that model. This means that there is no model mismatch at all. I would like the authors to expand on that.\n\nPlease see the General comment 1. \n\nWe agree the results on real scattering measurements are required. In the revised manuscript, we add experimental results in real-world optical setting. Our model still works while Poissonian shot noise and camera dark noise were added real scattering measurements.\n\n> **W3**. A minor point: the paper alternates between a differentiable model and a closed form model, which do not overlap. One can have a differential scattering-based model that is nonetheless a non-closed form model.\n\nThank you for your interesting idea. We will consider it for the future work.\n\n> **W4**. Some relevant work that should be acknowledged and contextualized.\n\nPlease see the General comment 3. \n\nIn the context outlined above, we undertook a thorough review of all the work in this field, categorizing it into the three specified regimes. Additionally, we engaged in a detailed discussion on the state-of-the-art advancements. Thank you for the suggestion which brings our paper could give the readers a more complete perspective on the field.\n\n> **Q1**. lack of context and comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches that have shown good results in real-world hazy images.\n\nPlease see the General comment 2 & 3. \n\nPer your suggestion, we engaged in a detailed discussion on the state-of-the-art advancements including de-hazing and underwater imaging papers suggested by reviewer dFYB. On the other hand, due to the different perspective in the context, utilizing it as a comparative method proves challenging.\n\n> **Q2**. I would like the authors to elaborate on the lack of model mismatch by assuming a simple gaussian kernel and then recovering under this assumption.\n\nPlease see General comment 1.\n\nPer your suggestion, we demonstrate a description of the model mismatch in Appendix A.5 of the revised manuscript, especially for noise and phase errors. Our real experiment results serve as a demonstration that our forward model can effectively overcome model mismatch in practical scenarios."

The paper is well introduce and clearly explain but the derivations in appendix are quite hard to follow. It is not derivations but sketchs of derivations. A reference to a technical report with the derivations will be very useful.\n\nPer your suggestion, we simplified the explanation on the forward model with technical reports to support the description. The key focus of the forward model lies on coherent propagation and the incoherent scattering kernel. We revised it to emphasize concentration on these aspects. The Gaussian approximation of the scattering kernel shape is a minor point, so we omitted the details.\n\n> **Q1**. I was not able to find the description about the learning step in the paper. May you tell more about this important step?\n\nWe have listed the training details in Appendix C for training our diffusion prior. It follows exactly same learning step with VDM which learns target(video data before scattering) distribution which means it does not require any information about physical forward model during learning(training) step. This is one the key advantages of our method that it can handle any variations in forward physical model, once training done."

Specifically, this paper focuses on scenarios where the scattering is approximated by the so-called shower curtain effect, where the forward operator essentially reduces to a Gaussian blur kernel. The proposed method is based on posterior sampling given a pre-trained video diffusion model, supposedly containing prior knowledge of natural videos. The restoration of the original video is equivalent to doing a posterior sampling of the video diffusion model, conditioning on the blurry measurements. The evaluation of the proposed method is mainly done on two existing natural video datasets, and the scattering effect is simulated."

This paper only contains restoration results from simulated scattering. No successful restoration on any real-world scattering were demonstrated.\n\nPlease see the General comment 1. \n\nWe agree the results on real scattering measurements are required. In the revised manuscript, we add experimental results in real-world optical setting. Our model still works while Poissonian shot noise and camera dark noise were added real scattering measurements.\n\n> **W2**. This paper only focuses on a naive special case of scattering, where the forward operator is trivially a Gaussian blur. Real-world scattering is much more complicated can requires the modeling of phase error caused by the scattering medium.\n\nPlease see the General comment 2. \n\nOur model is the first to combine a wave propagation model and a convolution with a blur kernel in the context of seeing through dynamic scattering media. With these modifications, may deal with the problem of object positioned at arbitrarily distance from scattering medium and the medium\u2019s thickness of far beyond the regime discussed in Regime 3 of general comment 2.\n\nWe emphasize that dealing with the problem of object positioned at arbitrarily distance from scattering medium and the medium\u2019s thickness is sufficiently complicated problem representing real-world scattering.\nWe believe our model has a great significance in imaging through scatter problem and makes an advancement compared to the previous methods.\n\n> **W3**. Ignoring the significance on the problem of optical scattering, the technical contribution on the algorithm side is very limited. The paper introduces minimal changes to existing approaches that apply the diffusion posterior sampling strategy on other inverse problem tasks.\n\nAs reviewer AVri kindly summarize our work, our method shows similar extension allowing to extend Diffusion models as Video Diffusion Models (VDM). The main contribution on the algorithm side is that the exploiting the  spatio-temporal correlation can bring huge improvements not only for generative models but also for inverse problem solvers like DPS. To best of our knowledge, this work is first video reconstruction study using diffusion prior and optical forward model. It is simple but very effective method for real-world, because real-world signals mostly temporally coherent. We firmly believe that our approach will serve as a source of inspiration for both the computer vision and optics research fields.\n\n> **W4**. This paper does not include literature review on the problem of imaging through optical scattering, and fails to cite recent papers that could give the readers a more complete perspective on the state-of-the-art\n\nPlease see the General comment 3. \n\nIn the context outlined above, we undertook a thorough review of all the work in this field, categorizing it into the three specified regimes. Additionally, we engaged in a detailed discussion on the state-of-the-art advancements. Thank you for the suggestion which brings our paper could give the readers a more complete perspective on the field.\n\n> **Q2**. Can the proposed framework handle more sophisticated forward model?\n\nThis method retains all the advantages of DPS. In other words, it can restore measurements even in cases where shot-noise and Gaussian noise are added to the measurement, also for the forward operator is nonlinear. \nThe capacity to address shot noise is a pivotal factor, our method highly effective in precisely restoring real optical measurements. In this context, our paper makes a significant contribution by illustrating the feasibility of such a forward model design in practical applications. Consequently, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results within this framework."

As echoed by Reviewer dFYB, the experimental results are indeed simplistic, and frankly not convincing in the context of imaging through optical scattering. Moreover, the technical contributions on the learning side are also limited (i.e., reapplying DPS). Lastly, the crucial limitation of assuming a naive Gaussian blur as the forward model cannot be overlooked. Therefore, considering its lackluster significance for physical sciences and use of learning representations, I would not rate this paper to be above the threshold for ICLR."

                        "value": "Thank you for your invaluable feedback. In the light of your comments, we have conducted additional experiments featuring more complex scenes (specifically, a Pac-Man video sourced from YouTube). The additional results can be found in Fig. 9 (c) of Appendix A. \n\nWe fully understand your concern regarding the simplicity of our model. Indeed, the scattering kernel that describes the ensemble-averaged intensity response of a scattering medium (i.e. the intensity response on the output plane for a point source on the input plane) varies depending on the properties of a scattering medium, such as scatterers' shape and size, and refractive indices of scatterers and an embedding medium. Here, based on the assumption that the kernel function smoothly and slowly decays, we simply assumed it as a Gaussian function and proved its effectiveness.\n\nAt the current moment, we could not make significant modifications to our experimental system and the proposed forward model because of the limited time allowed for open discussion. For the final version after this period, we will further investigate and demonstrate our method\u2019s extendibility with additional real-experiment results involving more complex scenes with the sophisticated considerations on the types of scattering kernel functions.\n\nLastly, we reiterate that our work tackles a challenging inverse problem that deals with not only blurred but also absolute-squared, wave-propagated measurements at arbitrary distances from the scattering medium and with variations in medium thickness. All of this achieved using a single trained diffusion prior. We would like to note that the inversion problem relevant to blurring operation and the inversion problem relevant to the absolute square operation of complex wave propagation individually hold their merits and have long been studied in the context of deblurring and holographic imaging. For this challenging combined problem, we demonstrated superior results by fully leveraging the spatial and temporal correlations of diffusion models. We firmly believe that our model holds great significance in this regard."
