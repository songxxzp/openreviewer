                    "value": "The authors propose a new framework for a low-latency client-side implementation of a RAG solution that is aided by an asynchronous memory update process that is aided by a cloud LLM, called HybridRAG. The asynchronous nature of the approach allows for a very remarkable speed up in latency. The main (and only?) target task for the approach is composition assistance, which if I understood correctly is text completion aided by a reference corpus.\n\nTheir approach consist of 1) a delayed context retriever (the augmentation coordinator), which reduces the number of requests by waiting until a certain \"edit distance\" threshold is reached. 2) a FIFO memory mechanism; 3) a document retriever using the Dense Passage Retrieval method; 4) a memory generator, which is a cloud-based LLM that summarizes the retrieved documents. They also propose the method for fine-tuning the client LM to be better suited to the HybridRAG task, which I believe is their recommended approach.\n\nInterestingly, they not only improve on the latency of the vanilla RAG approach, they also outperform it in output quality (with both the trained and untrained models).\n\nThey also show that even though the delayed update mechanism hurts performance, it is still an improvement over the vanilla baseline."

This shows great promise (though it also warrants more investigation)"

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "I have some general reservations about the claims, the most important of which concerns the validity of the dataset and metrics used:\n1. the first and main dataset used for evaluation is the WikiText-103 dataset. As the authors also mention, it's highly likely that both the OPT and GPT-3 models have been trained (directly or indirectly) on this or similar data. As such, this makes it an odd choice for a \"RAG\" method, where the main value prop is improving the model when the base knowledge is lacking. To further support this claim, we also see that \"GPT-3 zero-shot\" is highly competitive and beats all the models in many of the metrics.\n\n2. GPT-3 is in some sense being used both as the evaluator, the trainer, and the memory generator. The concern with this is the possible bias towards its own results. I believe all the metrics used, e.g. BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, etc, are highly susceptible to such bias as they cannot fairly compare two correct solutions that are worded differently.\n\nHere are a set of other more minor issues:\n3. HybridRAG w/o finetuning seems pretty much just as good as the finetuned version. So I'm surprised that the authors are actually recommending the finetuned version at all. Also, the fact that this model does so much better than vanilla RAG generates a lot of questions. I would have expected more ablations to get to the bottom of this disparity. Are the summaries really that much more effective? Or is it the FIFO memory mechanism? Why? Looking at the summary samples, they do not look that much more concise. Do you have comparisons on the average length of the documents vs the summarized version?\n\n4. In comparisons (e.g. Table 2), it's not obvious how much \"edit distance\" or how asynchronous actually are the HybridRAG models. In the absence of this info, makes me believe that they are being compared in the \"idealized\" scenario, which then makes all latency claims highly unfair.\n\n5. For a method that claims reduced latency as their main benefit, I find the latency comparisons to be not enough, and the existing results seem to be hastily put together.\n\n6. Though I find this point to be slightly unfair, but using the OPT and GPT-3 models seems slightly outdated by now and makes the results less relevant.\n\n7. Lastly, I want to mention that since most of the improvements are on the systems side, I'm not sure if ICLR is the correct venue for this work. I am by no means giving a diminished value to the contributions in this point"

And if your answer is yes, then why can you elaborate why?\n- Section 4.2.2 mentions \".. inference time is approximately 1.45 times slower compared to a GPU machine\". But eye-balling the numbers from Figure 3.d gives me a larger gap (at least 3x). Am I wrong?"

Restricted Testing Scope: The evaluation is confined to only two datasets - WikiText and Pile. The absence of tests on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain QA and fact verification, limits its broader applicability. Moreover, the exclusive testing on the OPT model fails to demonstrate the framework's generalizability across other models like LLaMA."

I had an idea what the paper was trying to propose, but it wasn't until I reached the dataset section that the problem, next word(s) completion, became clear. The intro reads more like a conclusion, as it uses concepts that aren't defined until later. One example: the word memory is used dozens of times before it's defined in section 3.2, and I what memory was in my head didn't quite match the details in that section. Additionally, it seems the goal (enhancing text prediction) should be a larger focus on the intro.\n\nThe figures and algorithm need more surrounding text to gently introduce a reader: the captions (of all figures too) should be substantially filled out to explain what is in the figure. For figure 1, I think a general workflow (step 1. user inputs this text, step 2. the augmentation coordinator ....) needs to be added, as the current figure is useful only if you already understand the methods.\n\nThe evaluation suffers from an important caveat: OPT is trained on wikipedia and thePile. This issue is not a showstopper for me, but it does cast some doubts on the generalizability of the method. I realize that LLMs are now being trained on the literal entire internet, so finding unseen datasets is non-trivial. I do agree, however, with the conclusions of the paper that HybridRAG is better than the baselines. \n\n\nMinor:\n* section 3.3, it would be nice if the full training dataset was explicitly defined as a variable\n* training/test sets should be defined for the evaluation"
