                    "value": "This paper formulates hyperspherical embedding to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. From the training perspective, the authors train a hyperspherical embedding based on the von Mises-Fisher distribution based on the MLE objective. Then, they use the hyperspherical free energy as a test objective. The authors show the efficacy of the proposed method in out-of-distribution detection benchmarks with varying sizes. Furthermore, as the evaluation metric does not rely on the nearest neighbors, the method significantly excels in computational speed compared to alternative out-of-distribution methods that rely on the test scores."

                    "value": "Although I am fond of the simple and efficient out-of-distribution detection algorithm as a baseline for further research, I have various concerns about this paper, including novelty, clarity, and significance.\n\nOriginality\\\n(1) Authors train the hyperspherical embedding via MLE loss, as done in previous papers [1,2]. \\\n(2) Authors focus on novelty in testing measures but this is just a proxy term for the negative log-likelihood. Although the perception of novelty is subjective, I also do not find this high-level concept of applying likelihood for OOD detection surprising or novel.\n\nClarity\\\n(1) While this paper's concept is simple, the paper lacks details.\\\n(2) For example, I found it confusing to directly compare CIDER, SIREN, and the proposed loss function since CIDER and SIREN impose additional regularization terms. \\\n(3) Or a basic specification for random variable z.\n\nSignificance\\\n(1) The paper frameworks the work as cross-entropy vs hyperspherical embeddings. But I do not think the comparison is fair. Classifiers trained by cross-entropy loss are widespread and easily collected in the wild. A strategy tailored to output OOD detection statistics from pre-trained classifiers via CE loss gets its merit due to its ubiquity. However, I do not feel the same applies to the hyperspherical embeddings. Instead, this is a pre-training strategy like [3,4]. Hence, I feel like the method should be **compared against various state-of-the-art** OOD detection methods when (image, label) information is given.\\\n(2) I find the gain of this method as a postprocessing strategy is limited. For example, [5] scores 94.28\\%, [6] scores 95.06\\%, and greatly outperforms the performance of this method despite being trained on the CE loss. While this method can benefit its performance by combining such methods, it is not sure in the current experiment results and should be verified via extra experiments.\\\n(3) Furthermore, I am also skeptical of hyperspherical embedding as a training strategy that learns better representation **in general**. A recently proposed benchmark of [7] compares CIDER [2] (which originates from the same training framework as this paper) to other strategies and shows its deficit in Near-OODs (e.g. SSB-Hard, NINCO) even compared to a simple rotation prediction strategy [8]. Moreover, it scores the worst among all compared to pretraining strategies. I think the bold assumption of this paper of showcasing hyperspherical embedding as an effective training loss should be verified by comparing other strategies (e.g. AugMix, RandAugment, RegMixup) on such challenging OOD, instead of comparing against only easy ones.\\\n(4) While I mainly focused on criticizing on ImageNet-1k dataset, the same reasoning can be applied to CIFAR-100 given the low scores in Table 1. of [7].\n\nIn summary,  given that this work is outperformed by various works that perform OOD detection on a classifier trained by CE or other strategies, I do not find any reason why should we train the classifier on hyperspherical embeddings (which is a very time-consuming task, especially for larger real-world datasets) and then perform OOD detection. Furthermore, I feel like this paper proposes a straightforward combination of existing works: hyperspherical embedding for training and energy function for OOD detection. Hence, I lean towards rejection."

Hence, I stick to the current scores. Below are my further concerns on the author's rebuttal. \n\n1. About near-OOD datasets: While I acknowledge the result on NINCO is beyond the performance of baseline methods in the OpenOOD benchmark, I would like to see the general picture including other ones.\n2. I do not find any results in common corruption. If the authors used the corruption operation (e.g. blur noise, digital, snow...), they should specify what severity they used. It just seems like the author just applied data augmentation for OOD detection."

                        "value": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for the detailed review and constructive criticism. We also appreciate the reviewer's recognition of our paper's clarity and strong results. We address the question below in detail.\n\n> Q1. Why fine-tune the last residual block only?\n\nThat's a great question. We performed fine-tuning on the last residual blocks, mostly to lower computational cost due to limited GPU resources. One can easily use our method and fine-tune on the entire backbone, without stability issues. On small-scale datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our training is indeed performed from scratch, on the entire network backbone. \n\n> Q2. Difference w.r.t. SIREN\n\nWe highlight the major differences below:\n\n- SIREN uses maximum class-conditional likelihood (see **Table 1**), which is mathematically different from the hyperspherical energy score. Unlike SIREN, hyperspherical energy is theoretically sound for OOD detection, due to its log-likelihood interpretation (see Section 3.1 for details). Our OOD scoring function enjoys rigorous theoretical interpretation from a log-likelihood perspective, while SIREN's does not. Our derivation and interpretation of hyperspherical energy provided in Section 3.1 is an entirely new contribution, relative to SIREN.\n- SIREN primarily focuses on representation shaping loss during training time. In contrast, we focus on a novel test-time OOD detection scoring function. Our method is the first to establish the connection between the hyperspherical representations and Helmholtz free energy for OOD detection. From a training-time perspective, we also derive new insight into how the learning objective induces lower hyperspherical energy (Section 3.2), which directly connects to our proposed OOD scoring function.\n\n> Q3. Performance on vision transformers\n\nThanks for the suggestion - these new experiments are underway and will be added to our updated manuscript. \n\n\n> Q4. Could the authors provide experimental details to obtain the results in Table 2? Additionally, error bars and the number of tries on the results would be appreciated.\n\nTo provide clarity on the results in Table 2, we focused on measuring the time required to calculate the score for each sample. We obtained these results by averaging the time taken to calculate scores for samples in the ID dataset across each column. **The updated Table 2 now includes error bars**, indicating the variability in results across samples in the dataset.\n\n\n> Q5. Could the authors provide error bars for their results by training on multiple random seeds? I believe this would strengthen their empirical contributions.\n\nExcellent point. Indeed, we have provided error bars in **Figure 3**, where the results are based on multiple training over 3 random seeds. \n\n\n> Q6. Limitations\n\nA key strength of our method is its grounded interpretation from a likelihood perspective, as outlined in Lemma 3. This approach, however, necessitates training the model under the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. While our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models in certain scenarios, it's important to note that it is less common than models trained using traditional cross-entropy loss. This may limit its immediate applicability in environments where standard cross-entropy loss models are the norm. However, we believe that the trustworthiness of the models is worth an effort to train them in a certain way."

It introduces a novel framework known as \"Hyperspherical Energy\" for OOD detection, which connects energy with hyperspherical representations, offering a rigorous perspective from a log-likelihood standpoint. The method is designed to provide a reliable and theoretically justified OOD detection indicator, addressing the limitations of energy-based scores derived from models trained with cross-entropy loss. Hyperspherical energy operates on latent embeddings, modeled as hyperspherical embeddings with constant norm, and is based on the negative log partition function of the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. The paper includes theoretical derivations and optimization techniques. Notably, the proposed method demonstrates competitive performance on OOD detection benchmarks, outperforming some baselines. The paper highlights the key distinctions and advantages of Hyperspherical Energy compared to conventional energy-based methods and non-parametric density estimation techniques. It is shown to achieve both strong empirical performance and theoretical soundness."

Our method outperforms the current best post-hoc method ASH by a significant margin, while enjoying the theoretical rigor. \n\n|                       | SVHN      |           | Places365 |           | LSUN     |           | iSUN      |           | Texture   |           | Average   |           |\n|:--------------------- | --------- |:--------- |:--------- | --------- | -------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |:--------- |:--------- |:--------- | --------- |\n| **Method**            | **FPR**   | **AUROC** | **FPR**   | **AUROC** | **FPR**  | **AUROC** | **FPR**   | **AUROC** | **FPR**   | **AUROC** | **FPR**   | **AUROC** |\n| GradNorm [1]          | 91.05     | 67.13     | 55.72     | **86.09** | 97.80    | 44.21     | 89.71     | 58.23     | 96.20     | 52.17     | 86.10     | 61.57     |\n| ExGrad [3]            | 77.29     | 81.45     | 78.70     | 78.62     | 74.93    | 81.69     | 75.61     | 80.83     | 81.44     | 78.78     | 77.59     | 80.27     |\n| ASH_B@65 - Energy [4] | 61.87     | 87.08     | 79.66     | 77.24     | 75.38    | 80.76     | 71.51     | 81.45     | 75.09     | 77.30     | 72.70     | 80.77     |\n| ASH_S@90 - Energy [4] | 38.00     | 93.24     | 81.77     | 72.92     | 75.69    | 78.41     | 67.10     | 82.72     | 64.08     | 83.23     | 65.33     | 82.10     |\n| Hyperspherical Energy | **17.81** | **96.39** | **76.74** | 76.01     | **8.46** | **98.25** | **57.92** | **85.98** | **31.83** | **93.24** | **38.55** | **89.97** |\n\nGradOrth [2] has not yet released their codebase.

We have included such a plot in our revised draft. Please see **Appendix F** for details. \n\n> Performance on different datasets\n\nThe high FPR95 for places365 might be due to the artifact in the dataset itself, rather than the methodology. Despite its common use in literature, the test dataset can be flawed since many images can be distributionally close to ID data. For example, recent work [5] pointed out that Places have some overlapping classes with the ImageNet-1k, which may lead to high FPR95 in evaluation.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis for CIFAR-100, we analyze the FPR95 for each category in Places365. We found that more than half of the 365 types of images have FPR95 of at least 79%. This suggests that there\u2019s a lot of overlap between ID and OOD data, which leads to high rates of false positives. On closer inspection, we saw that certain types of images, like natural landscapes and room scenes, are more likely to have this problem. For example, in the places365 dataset, images in the \"television_room\" category often get mixed up with \"television\", \"couch\", or \"table\" classes from CIFAR-100 because those objects are in the pictures. This confusion leads to FPR95 to be as high as 97%. Another example is the \"storage_room\" images in places365. They get classified as \"table\" or \"wardrobe\" if those items are in the picture, resulting in an FPR95 of 79%.\n\n[5] Bitterwolf et al., In or Out?

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate your positive feedback and insightful comments. Your acknowledgment of our work's clarity and unique contribution means a lot to us. We address the questions below in detail.\n\n> Q1. What can be said of the absolute OOD detection performance of the proposed method?\n\nThanks for the insightful question. We believe it's meaingful to look at both the absolute and relative performance. In particular, Table 3 is based on a challenging setting of CIFAR-100 as ID. As you can see, early method such as MSP can have average FPR95 as high as 83.90%. This signifies the non-trivialness of the task itself. This can be attributed to two factors. First, the ID accuracy on CIFAR-100 is suboptimal (75.03\\% as we report in Appendix Table 5), which means the model does not have a strong inherent characterization of the ID data within its representation. Secondly, the ID data and some OOD data can share spurious correlation (e.g., blue sky background), which further exacerbate the detection difficulty. \n\nNoticeably, in this challenging setting, our method can reduce the FPR95 from the earliest 83.9% to now 38.55% on this challenging task, which we believe is significant progress already. Admittedly, there is still large room for improvement in future research. From a practical point of view, we do desire as low absolute FPR95 as possible. That would be the dream of all researchers in this field, as make more progress :)\n\n> Q2. Common failure cases\n\nThe high FPR95 for places365 might be due to the artifact in the dataset itself, rather than the methodology. Despite its common use in literature, the test dataset can be flawed since many images can be distributionally close to ID data. For example, recent work [1] pointed out that Places have some overlapping classes with the ImageNet-1k data, which may lead to high FPR95 in evaluation.\n\nTo investigate this hypothesis for CIFAR-100, we analyze the FPR95 for each category in the places365 dataset. We found that more than half of the 365 types of images have FPR95 of at least 79%. This suggests that there\u2019s a lot of overlap between ID and OOD data, which leads to high rates of false positives. On closer inspection, we saw that certain types of images, like natural landscapes and room scenes, are more likely to have this problem. For example, in the places365 dataset, images in the \"television_room\" category often get mixed up with \"television\", \"couch\", or \"table\" classes from CIFAR-100 because those objects are in the pictures. This confusion leads to FPR95 to be as high as 97%. Another example is the \"storage_room\" images in places365. They get classified as \"table\" or \"wardrobe\" if those items are in the picture, resulting in an FPR95 of 79%.\n\n> Q3. Limitations\n\nA key strength of our method is its grounded interpretation from a likelihood perspective, as outlined in Lemma 3. This approach, however, necessitates training the model under the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. While our method achieves accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art models in certain scenarios, it's important to note that it is less common than models trained using traditional cross-entropy loss. This may limit its immediate applicability in environments where standard cross-entropy loss models are the norm. However, we believe that the trustworthiness of the models is worth an effort to train them in a certain way.\n\n> Q4. Extension to regression\n\nThat's a very interesting question! It may be possible to extend from classification to regression setting. For example, previous work [2] showed the feasibility for regression by optimizing outputs as an interpolation between two prototypes on the hypersphere. It's worth noting that the loss function employed in [2] was different from ours, so we need more conclusive investigation in the future to determine the feasibility. \n\n[1] Bitterwolf et al., In or Out?

I have struggled to find enough time to both write responses as an author, and participate in the discussions as a reviewer)\n\nI have read the other reviews and all responses.\n\nThe response to my question 1 and 2 is quite interesting. The new results in the response to Reviewer aQu1 are good additions.\n\nHowever, Reviewer A9ru raises some good points. In particular, Significance point (1) - (3) in Weaknesses.\n\nI am still borderline on this paper, I will keep my score of \"5: marginally below\" for now."
