                    "value": "This paper studies the problem of personalized federated learning with a collaboration graph. The authors first construct a client-wise similarity graph with dataset similarity, and then solve the problem with an alternate optimization algorithm. First, clients optimize their local parameters with a graph-structured parameter regularization (a somewhat extension of FedProx). Then, the parameters are denoised globally to ensure a smoothness of parameters across the graph. Experiments are done with comparisons to a good range of PFL baselines, where the proposed FedPnP outperforms the baselines."

                    "value": "W1. It seems that the authors fail to compare the proposed FedPnP with some highly related baselines. For example, SFL (Chen et al. 2022) is a highly related baseline of FedPnP (and it also cited in this paper!) but not compared. This is a major drawback, since SFL not only involves graph structures in personalized federated learning but also learns the graph structure as well. Also, the authors could have cited an ICML 2023 paper (Ye et al. 2023). In addition, as this work aims to recover client-wise graphical relations, I think it is good to discuss its relation with federated multi-task learning (Smith et al. 2017), as the task-wise relationship can also be interpreted as a graph, and each client denotes a task in (Smith et al. 2017). \n\nW2. Similar to W1, the authors could have made a better conceptual comparison with SFL (Chen et al. 2022). The conceptual difference and the technical innovation of FedPnP is not clear against SFL. I am not a theory guy so I may not understand this paper very well, but I believe that a conceptual comparison with SFL is good to the general audience. \n\nW3. From table 1, it seems that FedPnP is sensitive to hyperparameter selection. For example, FedPnP with $\\gamma=1$ is often very poor. In addition, the optimal $\\gamma$ across datasets also vary a lot. It may be good if the authors can provide some guidelines on hyperparameter tuning. \n\nW4. The authors may use some more realistically generated personalized FL models (e.g. those from LEAF, https://leaf.cmu.edu/). This is important especially because MNIST is simple and may not draw a very good conclusion. \n\n(Chen et al. 2022) Personalized Federated Learning With a Graph.
