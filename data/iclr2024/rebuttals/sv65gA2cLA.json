Using the multi-head attention component, which is used for the Transformer network, the proposed method carries out deep kernel learning, and then the learned kernel is employed to select the next query point following a Bayesian optimization procedure.

Eventually, query points are determined by optimizing the respective acquisition function defined on subspaces according to Algorithm 1.  I think it reduces the need to use attention-based kernels.

There is previous work that considers the setting of both categorical and numerical parameters.\n* For Equation (2), $\\phi$ is parameters?  It seems like a function, not parameters, according to Equation (2).\n* Could you elaborate the sentence \"However, not only do different algorithms require different hyperparameters, but also different microstructures have different value ranges for the same hyperparameter\" in Page 4?\n* What is a booster?  I think it should be a base learner or base estimator.\n* What is a father vertex or father node?  Is it different from a parent node?\n* I think that \"to the best of our knowledge, there is no suitable hand-crafted kernel function capable of modeling the similarity between these configurations from different subspaces which have different dimensions and dependencies\" is not true according to the references I mentioned early.\n* I would like to ask about how the name and value of hyperparameters are handled.  Is a name processed as a natural language?  Is a value is normalized?\n* For Figures 3 and 4, the results at iteration 0 are different across methods.

Since one of the major goals of the paper is AutoML, this seems to be defeating the main purpose by adding manual feature construction. Please clarify and discuss this important point. \n\n- Some statements in the paper are not entirely incorrect. For example, it is mentioned that \"there is no suitable hand-crafted kernel function capable of modeling the similarity between these configurations from\" but arc-kernel (reference [1] below) is one such kernel that handles conditional search spaces and is a natural baseline for this problem. Please consider reevaluating them. \n\n    - [1] Swersky, K., Duvenaud, D., Snoek, J., Hutter, F., & Osborne, M. A. (2014).

Please explain this. I also think a simple baseline with imputing missing values for inactive hyperparameters is a simple baseline that is easy to try should be included.

                    "value": "1. The most concerning problem is the motivation and problem setup. While the author argues that the proposed embedding and modeling are designed to deal with specific hierarchical dependencies, there is neither a formularized statement of the problem involving the hierarchical structure (only a short footnote in the introduction and an example which is illustrated in Figure 1) nor a clear definition or statement of considered 'hyperparameters' (it seems that the paper deal with the anisotropy of the objective yet this is not clearly defined). The essential concepts need to be more specific throughout the paper. Otherwise, the vagueness undermines the soundness and contribution of the paper.\n\n2. The discussion on related work is limited. For example, the recent advancement in casual-model-based BO methods [1,2] that also explicitly deals with the dependencies on the search space needs to be included. \n\n3. Some results are placed in the appendix but are actually critical while insufficient.  The ablation study doesn't show consistent improvement over AttnBO-no-emb in both Figure 13-c and Figure 14-a. Apart from the ablation study, the visualization of the attention maps only uses two random seeds and, therefore, lacks significance.\n\n4. The baselines in the experiment are insufficient compared to the related methods discussed in Section 2. Specifically, Na\u00efve DKL-based BO or VAE-based BO are not compared as baselines. This comparison could serve as the ablation study of the proposed encoder-based AttenBO.\n\n5. The paper's primary contribution resides in the domain of representation and kernel learning, offering a novel solution for the Gaussian process in the context of structured input. The acquisition function is not tailored to this particular setting. The proposed method should be discussed within the broader scope of GP studies rather than being confined to a Bayesian optimization-oriented approach. In that sense, the intermediate evidence of improved GP regression is far from sufficient.\n\t\t\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Aglietti, Virginia, Xiaoyu Lu, Andrei Paleyes, and Javier Gonz\u00e1lez. \"Causal Bayesian optimization.\" In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, pp. 3155-3164.
