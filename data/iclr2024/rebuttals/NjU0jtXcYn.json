                    "value": "This submission provides a unifying framework for encompassing user beliefs in Bayesian Optimization (BO) beyond the usual priors on kernel  hyperparameters. Previous approaches offered to augment BO with expert beliefs $\\pi$, like optimum value or location, but mostly focused on doing so at the acquisition function level. Here, the authors propose to integrate this at the surrogate level. Instead of the classical Gaussian Process prior $p(f)$, they introduce a user belief over functions $\\pi(f) \\propto \\frac{p(f|\\pi)}{p(f)}$. Thus, $p(f|\\pi)$ can be obtained by reweighting samples from $p(f)$ proportionally to their probability of occurring under $\\pi(f)$. \n\nAs the user belief is assumed independent of the data-generating mechanism, the resulting posterior $p(f|\\mathcal{D},\\pi)$ is naturally proportional to the user belief $\\pi(f)$ and the likelihood $p(f|\\mathcal{D})$. It is therefore non Gaussian for nontrivial user beliefs, an issue circumvented by the authors using a decoupled sampling scheme. Likewise, classical acquisition functions like Expected Improvement or Maximum Entropy Search are not tractable anymore, which led the authors to leverage and tailor their Monte-Carlo version to this specific case. \n\nIn the end, the proposed method, *ColaBO*, is then evaluated on a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks, and demonstrates convincing performances against its competitors, particularly for misleading user beliefs.\nAs these benchmarks contain hyperparameter tuning of Deep Learning models, I believe this submission completely falls into the scope of ICLR."

                    "value": "* The mathematical derivation is too informal in some places, affecting clarity. I believe this needs to be improved. For instance, $\\pi$ here represents a belief over functions. Then why is Eq. (4) a function that receives a point $x \\in \\mathcal{X}$? Shouldn't it be a probability distribution over functions? Also, Def 3.1 introduces a conditioning on $\\pi$. I found this quite confusing. Is $\\pi$ a density? a function? or a random variable?\n* There are concerns about the fairness of the experiments. The authors state that \"ColaBO and \u03c0BO are initialized with the mode of the prior followed by 2 Sobol samples, whereas LogEI and MES are conventionally initialized with D + 1 Sobol samples.\" Shouldn't logEI and MES also have been initialized on the mode of the prior? If we assume that such prior information is present in user-guided BO methods, it is fair to assume that conventional BO methods also have access to this information. \n* The evaluations are okay but not extensive (especially compared to the piBO paper). I think this is an important point, given that the utility of user-guided BO methods can only be judged empirically on a case-study basis. This connects with my next concern.\n* The paper lists a couple of different types of function priors in Section 3.1 but only seems to evaluate one type of such prior. It is, therefore, hard to judge how general this framework is for incorporating prior knowledge. Especially since the users state in the contributions that one can \"incorporate arbitrary user knowledge.\" \n\n### Major Comments\n* The contribution statement is too general except for item 2. For instance, 1 and 3 can be applied to any user-guided BO method. I expect some more technical details about what this method offers to the field of user-guided BO.\n* The derivation of importance sampling in Eq. (10) is unclear. $\\pi(f) p(f | D)$ is an unnormalized density, but the integral is taken over it. Then, the equality with Eq. (9), doesn't hold since the expectation is not normalized.\n* In Section 3.3, the authors introduce a tempering scheme based on the number of datapoints. Furthermore, they draw connections with generalized Bayesian inference (GBI). I think the authors should make it clear that the connection is very loose. A major characteristic of GBI is to find a statistically principled way to come up with the temperature, which is not the case here. It is particularly misleading as, in the last sentence of Section 3.3, the paper states that tempering is done so in a \"principled Bayesian manner.\" \n\n### Minor Comments\n* Couldn't the name collaborative Bayesian optimization be misleading as to making people to think this method involves multiple users?\n* Section 1 first sentence: Please cite classic papers that introduced BO for historical context.\n* Figure 9-12: The boundary of the error bands makes it hard to distinguish between the plots. Please consider improving the visibility here.\n* Section 2.1 equation: Generally, we aim to minimize the expectation of f or the regret. Saying that we minimize f, in the presence of noise, is too informal.\n* Section 2.2 second from the last sentence: I think replacing \"standard method\" with \"classic method\" would be better here since we have an influx of more efficient methods.\n* Eq (2): Has the \"equivalent in distribution\" sign been defined anywhere?\n* Section 3.1 second paragraph second sentence: the sentence is incomplete.\n* References: please consider making the reference more consistent and check the entries. Carl et al 2022b has a typo: joint entropy eearch -> joint entropy search; Jones et al. 2018 is missing the journal entry; Kingma and Welling 2013 was published in ICLR\u201914."

We generally find the review to be insightful and have done our best to address the weaknesses in our work. In the newly uploaded pdf, we have:\n1. Added five additional HPO tasks (6D) from LCBench. Hopefully, this tackles the reviewer's concerns regarding the experimental evaluation. Moreover, all methods now utilize the same $\\text{Mode} + 2$ initialization, on all tasks. Lastly, we have added an illustrative example of how priors over preference relations can be used in ColaBO in a newly added Fig. 1 in the intro.\n2. Worked on clarity in Sec. 3 throughout. We address specific feedback below, but this includes:\n\t- The role of $\\pi$ and its conditioning - substituted for $\\rho$ to separate   \n\t- Densities and integrals - some missing proportionalities and normalizing constants\n\t- GBI relation removed.\n3. Specified contributions to better distinguish ColaBO from other user-guided BO.\n4. Minor comments/faults have been addressed.\nFor a discussion regarding each point of feedback, see below:\n\n#### __The mathematical derivation is too informal in some places, affecting clarity. I believe this needs to be improved. For instance, here represents a belief over functions. Then why is Eq. (4) a function that receives a point ? Shouldn't it be a probability distribution over functions? Also, Def 3.1 introduces a conditioning on $\\pi$. I found this quite confusing. Is $\\pi$ a density? a function? or a random variable?__\n\nWe see that the confusion is warranted, and have consequently re-hashed section 3.1. Hopefully, this improves the understanding and overall experience. $\\pi (f)$ is replaced by $\\rho (f)$. Moreover, the domains, co-domains and variable properties (i.e. randomness of $\\rho$ is communicated throughout. \n\nThe idea of Eq. 4 was to demonstrate how $\\pi(x)$ can be expressed as a function not of the optimizer $x^*$, but as a function of $f$. We subsequently introduce notation where $\\rho$ is a function of $f$ for some arbitrary function property, e.g. $x_*$ and $f_*$. We have now re-done the notation to clarify the inputs to each quantity and hope that this improves the overall clarity.\n\n#### __In Section 3.3, the authors introduce a tempering scheme based on the number of datapoints. Furthermore, they draw connections with generalized Bayesian inference (GBI). I think the authors should make it clear that the connection is very loose.__\n\nWe agree with the reviewer, and that section is now entirely removed. In later experiments, we found that the tempering did not substantially improve performance, and since its \"principled\" nature was debatable, we removed it to obtain an overall cleaner approach. In practice, the data is sufficient to decrease the impact of a poor user belief.\n\n#### __The derivation of importance sampling in Eq. (10) is unclear. is an unnormalized density, but the integral is taken over it. Then, the equality with Eq. (9), doesn't hold since the expectation is not normalized.__\n\nThanks for catching this typo. We missed a normalizing constant on $\\pi$, which will not generally be tractable. We have added this normalizing constant and clarified accordingly. We have added a breif comment on the sampling, but will cover it in more detail in the CR when space permits."

I can imagine that the authors spent quite a tough few weeks! \n\n\n\nIt is a little bit sad that making the experiments fairer took a toll on the significance of the proposed methodology. But still, it appears that the proposed framework has benefits, especially in terms of worst-case performance on the Hartmann 6 problem. Furthermore, I find the technique itself novel and interesting, as mentioned in my original review. In light of the revision, I am happy to raise my score. \n\nSome additional comments:\n* Still, most of the experiments are less than 10 dimensions. To increase the impact of the work, I recommend higher dimensional problems.\n* The reference formats are not very consistent. For example, some proceedings are in capitals, while some are in sentence cases. Some ArXiv papers have the ArXiv code, but some don't (Huang 2022, for example), and some have URLs while others don't. I recommend polishing the reference section.\n* Eq (6): Seems like using $x$ is a little confusing here. How about using $y$ to denote the function values?\n\nLastly, it seems that the authors might have missed my following comment:\n> Given that the authors rely on GP posterior sampling, an obvious thing that could have been tried is Thompson sampling. Have the authors tried to include it?\nI would be interested to hear if the authors could run additional experiments with Thomson sampling. (Given that the rebuttal period is almost over, this is a friendly suggestion, not a request!)"

We agree with the reviewer on the outlined weaknesses, and have addressed them, incorporating the following in the newly uploaded manuscript:\n\n\n1. We have added more HPO tasks (6D) from LCBench. Hopefully, this gives a more complete view of performance of ColaBO. They can now be found in the newly added Appendix A, but will go into Sec. 4 when space permits.\n2. Introduced examples (similar to Fig. 1) of ColaBO with max-value priors and priors over preferences to better highlight how various tasks can be addressed within the ColaBO framework. \n3. Re-worked notation in Sec. 3. The notation of $\\pi(f)$ is gone, and replaced with $\\rho(f)$ to better distinguish between them. Moreover, the properties of $\\rho$ are clearly specified, and it is defined in what we believe is a more well-defined manner. However, we have re-hashed and re-worded the notation to hopefully improve the reading experience. While time is short, we would greatly appreciate additional feedback on how clarity can be improved here.\n4. Previous Eqs. 8-13 have been clarified with regard to $f_*$, $x_*$ and the typo $f_n^*$.\nBelow, we address each of the reviewer\u2019s comments in detail.\n\n## Responses to concerns:\n#### __Although the empirical performance of ColaBO looks promising in the synthetic task and hyperparameter tuning task, the theory developed in the work is limited.__\n\nWe respect the reviewer's viewpoint and agree that the theoretical work is not extensive. However, the introduced theory serves the necessary purpose and yields a valid, conceptually simple and broadly applicable approach. \n\nNotably, there is a rather large collection of work in user-guided BO of various kinds (cited in the intro of the paper) which utilizes various types of knowledge, and ColaBO can successfully handle all of these types in a principled manner _without altering the approach_. As such, one can argue that this one piece of theory produces the general framework that user-guided BO has been missing. The newly added Fig. 1 exemplifies how all of these user beliefs are seamlessly dealt with by ColaBO.\n\nWe acknowledge that work on scalability and approximation quality should be addressed moving forward, but ultimately view this line of work as follow-up. \n\n#### __The presentation of the work can be improved. Initially, the authors define in Eq. 3 with input from $\\pi(x)$, but it later becomes $\\pi(f)$. Moreover, the notations become messier after Eq. 4, making it more challenging to follow. Also, while rejection sampling seems to be an important step in the model, the way it works is not introduced in the paper. Similar for RFF.__\n\nWe outline RFFs in the first paragraph of 2.3 and couldn\u2019t find space to expand on it further. The exclusion of various sampling approaches (rejection, importance) but will be added to a camera-ready along with RFFs when space will permit it. \n\nWe have made our best attempt at addressing your broader concern regarding clarity. Section 3.1 is now presented using slightly altered notation, where each property is properly distinguished and defined.\n\n#### __Given the authors\u2019 claim that this is a general framework for BO to incorporate prior, the paper should present concrete examples to demonstrate its generality. For example, the authors could show how the examples in the second paragraph of the introduction section can be solved effectively within the proposed framework.__\n\nWe agree that the conventional prior over the optimum is over-emphasized in the experiments we had presented. To the reviewer\u2019s point, we have added Fig. 1 to highlight examples of how each type of prior is incorporated into ColaBO. Hopefully, this serves to highlight the generality of ColaBO, as requested by the reviewer.\n\nMoreover, there are max-value prior tasks in App. C.2, Fig. 10. We will try and highlight these types of tasks in the paper by adding yet another one."

In the figure, we show that this type of prior yields a uniquely shaped model, and further emphasizes the flexibility of the framework.\n\n_______\nWe hope that the additional tasks and Figure 1, which highlights the versatility of ColaBO, has increased the reviewer's confidence in the quality of our paper. If the reviewer has any additional questions in the remaining time, we would be happy to address them."
