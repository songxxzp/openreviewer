D3GAT is proposed as an adaptation of DDGAT to overcome the issue that DDCAT \u201cjointly calculates the invariant pattern and the variant pattern of the node feature, which limits pattern learning, because they are decided jointly and cannot adjust with regard to the other.\u201d This claim seems to be unjustified. Through reading the paper, the reviewer is not convinced that calculating invariant pattern and the variant pattern would harm the model generalization ability. Some theoretical justifications or intuition demonstrations may be helpful. \n\n2. The proposed strategy to calculate weights for samples from different time stamps seems to be trivial. Crucial details are missing in the methodology part. For example, it is unclear how W_t is decided in equation (12). Also, it is unclear how the weight, w, participated in the training process and calculation of loss in algorithm 1.   \n\n3. DDGAT should be a crucial baseline to be compared with, but it is completely excluded from the experimental evaluation part of the main paper. Only the performance of DDGAT on COLLAB and Yelp datasets is provided in the appendix part. It is left unexplained why DDGAT is not included for comparison on other datasets. Besides, the D3GAT only outperforms COLLAB by 1%, and its improvement on Yelp also does not seem to be significant given the large standard deviations.  \n\n4. The paper needs to be carefully proofread to fix all typos and meet the standards of academic writing. See minor issues for details. Note that the listed issues are not exhaustive.  \n\n \n\nMinor issues: \n\n1. Section 2.3: It is incorrect to say \u201cand etc\u201d, \u201cand\u201d is redundant.  \n\n2. The title of table 2 is wrong.  \n\n3. The title of table 10 is wrong.  \n\n4. Table 1,2: there needs to be space between titles and tables.  \n\n5. Abbreviations like \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d should be avoided in formal writing."

Regarding Table 1, the paper mentions that training sets and test sets are split into different subdomains. How are the experiments conducted for the \u201cw/o DS\u201d option where there is no distribution shift?  \n\n3. Are there any specific reasons to compare the results on training datasets in Table 2?"

Firstly, the authors bring out a novel structure called dual disentangled dynamic graph attention networks based on the disentangled dynamic graph attention networks module(DDGAT) from DIDA[1]. The main difference between the novel structure and DDGAT is that the novel structure utilizes two modules for recognizing the invariant pattern and the variant pattern, separately. Then the authors propose a self-adaptive intervention method to combine the invariant and variant parts and improve the performance on unknown data. What's more, the authors also propose a novel curriculum-based sample importance reweighting method to adjust the weight of samples dynamically. The experiment and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in handling distribution shifts in dynamic graphs.\n\n[1] Zeyang Zhang, Xin Wang, Ziwei Zhang, Haoyang Li, Zhou Qin, and Wenwu Zhu.

                    "value": "W1. The paper is hard to follow due to several unclear presentations. For example, the implementation of the Assemble function in Equation 6 lacks clarity. The specific nature of $\\ell_{trainI}$ and $\\ell_{trainV}$ in Equation 9 and 11 is not elucidated. Additionally, it is not clear how the function f in Equation 13 transforms gradient vectors into scalar measures of importance.\n\nW2. In Section 4.3.2, the authors indicate that the gradient is computed using the loss, which is then used to calculate the importance weights. These weights are subsequently used to reweight the loss. Given this process, there appears to be a potential inconsistency in Algorithm 1 where the weight calculation in steps 4-5 and the loss calculation in steps 6-9 may be out of sequence. If my understanding is correct, steps for gradient calculation and gradient zeroing should be inserted before steps 4-5.\n\nW3. The importance sampling method described in Section 4.3 resembles a technique designed to accelerate convergence, and its relevance to curriculum learning does not appear to be particularly robust.\n\nW4. It was found in Section 5.4 that DIDA is more complicated than this paper $|E_t||S|d$, which refers to the time complexity of the intervention algorithm. Based on my understanding, this paper uses an adaptive intervention coefficient, which adaptively adjusts the number of interventions and also has the corresponding time complexity. However, the paper does not provide specific details on the implementation of the Assemble function. My understanding may be incorrect. I hope the author can explain this in more detail."
