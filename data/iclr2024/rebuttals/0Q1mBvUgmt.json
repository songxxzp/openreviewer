I believe the author should give some technical details about this important part.\n2. Many previous works have already decomposed the time series data into trends and seasonal data to solve the TSF problem. What sets this paper apart from other similar methods? If it's about the efficiency of model training and prediction (I think the authors highlight it in paragraph 2 of the introduction), it wasn't emphasized in the experimental section.\n3. Does this method assume that all the time series data has periodic patterns? The author emphasizes the distribution shift of the data, which contradicts periodicity. If the normalized data exhibits periodicity, the author didn't conduct an analysis in the experiment."

Which axis is the attention operation performed on?\n3. The authors mention the importance of intraperiod-variation and interperiod-variation in time series representation learning. However, it is not clear how the proposed representation block captures these variations separately.\n4. The results of TimesNet in Table 2 appear inconsistent with the original paper. In [1], TimesNet outperformed DLinear, while this paper concludes the opposite.\n5. The reported Avg results in Table 3 are incorrect. Besides, the proposed block only yields a slight 2.9% improvement in MSE according to my calculation.\n \n[1] Haixu Wu, et, al.

                    "value": "This article presents a new architecture for time series forecasting. This architecture is based on decomposing the signal into seasonal and trend components. Regarding the trend, a linear model is used. For the seasonal component, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is initially applied. The most important frequencies are retained, and the transformed signal is then passed through a block called the Temporal Aggregation Block. This block employs global attention to discover intra-period patterns, followed by weighting based on the importance of frequencies. Finally, a backbone (CNN, RNN, etc.) is used to obtain the final representation of the seasonal signal. This seasonal signal and the one predicted by the trend are then added together to obtain the final prediction. Experiments are conducted on the usual baselines and datasets in the field."

This block consists of global attention and frequency weighting. To me, this represents a very minor innovation compared to what already exists.\n\n* The major issue with this article concerns the absence of PatchTST [Nie et al. 2023] in the baselines. This work is mentioned 2 or 3 times in the paper, including the experimental section, so the authors are aware of its existence, but surprisingly, the results of PatchTST are not included in the result table. However, the results of the latter are almost always better than the proposed approach. This may not necessarily be a problem in itself - there could be other advantages to the proposed architecture. However, the deliberate omission of this comparison does not adhere to good scientific practices."
