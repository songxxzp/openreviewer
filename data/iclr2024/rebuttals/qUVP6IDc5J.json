                    "value": "This paper tackles the fundamental challenge of understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) encode and retrieve information, aiming to enhance their interpretability and reliability. To address this, the authors introduce AttributeLLaMA, a model extension built upon the LLaMA family of models. The primary objective is to enable LLMs to attribute their generated responses to specific sources of information. Remarkably, this capability is achieved through the fine-tuning of AttributeLLaMA using a mere 100 expert-annotated attribution examples. The results of their experimental studies are compelling, showing that attributions significantly boost LLM performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks, including MMLU and StrategyQA, with improvements exceeding 3.5% and 4.0%, respectively, when relevant attributions are incorporated. In addition to these performance enhancements, their analyses shed light on the exceptional memorization capacities of LLMs, particularly concerning Wikipedia documents included in their training data. This research underscores the potential of generating attributions to enhance the reliability and interpretability of LLMs, even with minimal supervision. This approach holds particular relevance for modern LLMs, which are susceptible to issues of memorization, as highlighted in the study."

While the authors discuss the memorization capabilities of the model which is interesting, they do not delve deeply into the potential implications of this, such as the risk of overfitting or the possibility of the model memorizing sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst the simplicity of the work is appreciated, the paper lacks the depth of insightful conclusions and novel findings. This renders the study somewhat overly straightforward, akin to the style of a technical blog rather than academic research.  We still do not know the principles of how to construct more high quality attributions to train LLMs after reading this paper."

As claimed in the paper, only 100 examples can elicit the ability of the model to generate evidence. Then why not use the same model to perform evidence generation and QA at the same time, by just calling the model once? Now the two-step process is more like we are using LLMs as an external knowledge base, which can be used for provide knowledge for another LLM for performing QA tasks. From this perspective, there are many existing literatures that have explored such a problem.\n\n2. The claim of \"minimum supervision\" seems to be oversimplified. How does the number 100 come from? Why it is the minimum supervision? Can this supervision be replaced by other machine generated (evidence, question-answer) pair? These questions need to be resolved in the paper.\n\n3. In general I think the contribution of the paper is not strong enough. Although the proposed framework seems effective, it considers a normal way that how we can utilize LLMs as knowledge source."

The key contribution appears to be the annotation of a small dataset and the following fine-tuning on one single LLM, which may not be generalizable. The dataset's high quality could be tailored to this particular model, limiting the broader applicability of the findings.\n2. The second concern is related to the reproducibility and generalizability of the work. There is a lack of detailed information on the data selection/annotation procedures, as well as a comprehensive analysis of why 100 examples are sufficient. It remains unclear whether selecting a random set of 100 QA pairs from another benchmark and asking for user annotations would also successfully elicit attributions from a large language model after fine-tuning.\n3. The prompt design is confusing: The authors compare LLaMa with LLaMa+AttributeLLaMa. However, after fine-tuning, AttributeLLaMa is capable of generating not just the evidence but also the answer, following the designed instructions. It is unclear why the direct outputs (answers) were not able to be directly used and compared (i.e., LLaMa vs. AttributeLLaMa)."
