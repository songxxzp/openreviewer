                        "value": "Thank you very much for your review! Please find below a point-to-point response for the weaknesses and questions from the review.\n\n*W1: The paper introduces various settings for ImplicitSLIM, but it would be beneficial to analyze and summarize the computational complexity of different variants respectively to provide a clearer understanding of their efficiency.*\n\nWe fully agree with this comment (see also Q2 of Reviewer uknn). In the updated version of the paper, we have added Figure 3 in Appendix E.1 to visualize the tradeoff between computation time, embedding dimensionality, and ranking scores. In particular, they show how much ImplicitSLIM is faster and more memory efficient compared to EASE, and also show how ImplicitSLIM boosts matrix factorization in terms of convergence time as well as in terms of performance.\n\n*W2: The paper could benefit from more detailed experimental studies on the influence of hyperparameters. Given the presence of multiple regularization and optimization items in the method, it would be more illustrative to have the model performance w.r.t. different parameter settings.*\n\nThe primary hyperparameter that, in our opinion, indeed deserves extensive experiments is the embedding dimensionality; we have presented comparative studies of different embedding dimensions in Figures 1 and 3 and Table 4. As for the other hyperparameters, there are no significant tradeoffs there, and we just look for their optimal values with Bayesian hyperparameter search.\n\n*W3: Although ImplicitSLIM has shown competitive performance against traditional linear encoders, it shows limitted improvement on deeper models like UltraGCN and RecVAE.*\n\nWe note that the application of ImplicitSLIM to all deep models in the experimental section statistically significantly accelerates their performance (except for one very specific case, H+Vamp(Gated) trained on the Netflix dataset and evaluated with Recall@k, in all other cases the speedup is significant). \n\nIn addition, we note that the application of ImplicitSLIM to these models improves convergence, with minor computational and memory overhead thanks to relatively low embedding dimensionality in deep models; for example, RecVAE+ImplicitSLIM achieves the best score of RecVAE almost twice faster than RecVAE itself.\n\nTherefore, we believe that applying ImplicitSLIM to deep recommendation models such as RecVAE and H+Vamp may bring advantages other than just improved metrics, and our experiments show that ImplicitSLIM is beneficial for all models where we have been able to apply it."

As a comparatively lightweight and effective solution, it has the potential to become a valuable tool in representation learning for collaborative filtering, contributing to both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. \n\nThe text is well-written and easy to follow.

Please find below a point-to-point response to the weaknesses and questions from your review.\n\n*W1: not a standalone approach which makes training less straightforward* \n\nYes, we agree with this statement in the general case: ImplicitSLIM is indeed a modification aimed to improve existing recommender systems rather than a separate model.\n\nHowever, in order to mitigate this issue as much as possible, we have performed extensive experiments applying ImplicitSLIM to the simplest suitable models, MF and PLRec. Moreover, one of experimental setups (called \u201cImplicitSLIM init\u201d in the paper) assumes that the item embeddings matrix for matrix factorization is initialized by ImplicitSLIM output, and there are no other computations during the training phase (user embeddings for held-out users are computed during the test phase given item embeddings). This learning procedure is indeed not performed in an end-to-end fashion.\n\nIn Section 4.2, we also make an attempt to make the training of ImplicitSLIM more straightforward; there, we show that a model regularized with the SLIM regularizer approximately matches a model regularized with ImplicitSLIM.\n\n*W2: applicable to embedding-based models only*\n\nYes, we agree that our approach deals only with embedding-based models and is not applicable, e.g., to recommendations based on nearest neighbors. However, most currently used recommender systems employ embedding-based models, and we believe that this does not significantly hinder the applicability and importance of our results.\n\n*W3: the source code is not provided*\n\nBy the conference guidelines for anonymity, we indeed have not published the source code openly but it has been attached in the supplementary files here in the submission.\n\n*Q1: There's a promise to provide empirical comparison with more natural-looking regularizer in Appendix E.2. However, not much information is provided there. The promise creates an expectation that there will be a more substantial comparative data with numbers and graphs. Is it planned to be provided?*\n\nWe are not certain that we have understood this comment correctly (and we apologize if not) but perhaps we have not been clear enough regarding what Appendix E.2 sets out to do. Appendix E.2 presents several simplifications to the default theoretical ImplicitSLIM definition that can significantly simplify the training process in practice (approximations a-c). All of these simplifications have succeeded in the sense that they speed up training while having no effect on the performance metrics. Therefore, the ImplicitSLIM setups evaluated in the paper already incorporate these simplifications, and the comparative data would just contain the same performance metrics over and over."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your review and comments! Please find a point-to-point response below.\n\n*Q1: In Section 3, the authors should explain more on the formular choices when developing ImplicitSLIM. For example, why do we use LLE, but use the neighbourhood of NN(i) = {1,2,\u2026,I} \\ {i} to make it \u2018global\u2019 (Section 3.1)? Why do we drop the sum-to-one constraint (Section 3.2)...*\n\nThank you for this remark \u2013 we agree that this could be explained better. First, the chosen neighborhood function and dropping the sum-to-one constraint are both necessary to perform the trick in Section 3.2 that makes it possible to avoid inverting huge matrices. \n\nConsidering EASE as a special case of the first step of LLE gives us additional motivation to use this neighborhood function, as we mention in Section 3.1; in general, the similarity of EASE and LLE motivates us to use LLE as a model for item/user representations learning.\n\nThe sum-to-one constraint at the first step implicitly ensures the sum-to-zero constraint at the second step of the original LLE, but in this work we propose a different second step, which is defined as an unconstrained optimization problem, so we have a technical reason to drop the sum-to-one constraint. We have updated Sections 3.1 and 3.2 to explain this more clearly.\n\n*Q2: ...\u201cIn addition, ALS applied to MF regularized by \u2026. about 5x faster\u201d, I may missed it but where do we find the \u20185x faster\u2019 comparison?*\n\nThank you for noticing this! In the updated version of the paper, we have added Fig. 3 in Appendix E.1 to visualize the tradeoff between computation time, embedding dimensionality, and ranking scores. In particular, it shows how much ImplicitSLIM is faster and more memory-efficient compared to EASE, and also shows how ImplicitSLIM boosts matrix factorization in terms of convergence time as well as in terms of performance.\n\n*Q3: In Figure 1, why ImplicitSLIM init + SLIM reg and SLIM-LLE init cannot have results with > 500 embedding dimension? Could we please add an appendix on the \u2018high computational costs\u2019?*\n\nBoth of these setups, unlike the others, require huge matrix inversions. Moreover, SLIM-LLE init setup requires the computation of eigenvectors for the smallest eigenvalues, and the ImplicitSLIM init + SLIM reg setup could not be solved with ALS, so we had to employ gradient descent for this problem. As a result, computational costs for these two settings are much higher, especially when the dimensionality of embeddings is large; hence we have evaluated these setups with embedding dimensions equal to 500 and lower. In the updated version of the paper, we have expanded Appendix C to explain it.\n\n*Q4: In Section 4.1, in the last sentence, the authors mentioned that \u201cthis procedure may be less stable \u2026 fewer calls to ImplicitSLIM\u201d. Why is that?*\n\nThe instability that may arise during the application of ImplicitSLIM to downstream models may lead to a sudden drop in performance metrics while training, followed by a recovery after several training epochs. For this reason, we update the embeddings using ImplicitSLIM once in a constant number of epochs to allow the model to recover. This effect can be observed in Figure 2 (convergence plots).\n\n*Q5: In Table 1, the performance results are not really impressive... \u201cMoreover, ImplicitSLIM is also faster than EASE\u2026 could replace EASE in some cases due to lower computational time and comparable performance.\u201d. Please explain which cases?*\n\nPlease see the answer to Q2 above: we have added Figure 3 in Appendix E.1 (and a corresponding explanation) to visualize how ImplicitSLIM outperforms EASE in terms of wall clock time and memory at the cost of a slight performance drop.\n\n*Q6: In Appendix E.3, Table 5, why RecVAE + ImplicitSLIM cannot perform better than RecVAE?*\n\nIn this experiment, we first took RecVAE+ImplicitSLIM fitted to maximize the overall score on the current dataset, and then evaluated it separately for high, mid, and low popularity items. The model was not fitted to maximize scores that correspond to high, mid, and low popularity items individually.\n\nThis experiment shows that the application of ImplicitSLIM to RecVAE improves its overall performance on the MovieLens20M dataset by improving the embeddings of highly popular items, while embeddings of mid- and low-popularity items may even slightly degrade. This observation could be explained by the fact that, as we note in Appendix D.1, we zero out columns in matrix A that correspond to unpopular items, which empirically leads to better overall performance but may hurt the performance for unpopular items. We have added an explanation of this effect to Appendix E.3.\n\n*Q7: References should be sorted as the current version is hard to follow (minor)*\n\nWe apologize but we didn\u2019t understand this remark: the references are sorted alphabetically by the first author\u2019s last name; we have checked last year\u2019s ICLR papers and saw the references sorted in the same way\u2026"
