For the CUB dataset, the anomalies are more significant, so the synthesized data is effective, but for the MVTec dataset, the anomalies are more subtle, so the synthesized data is not effective.\n+ The paper's abnormal synthesis function is entirely based on DiffStyle, and it remains to be verified whether the method of interpolating abnormal images from different normal images is reasonable. Perhaps perturbing features in different dimensions in the latent space may have better results.

Mirzaei et al. also use CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, but we found that the images in these datasets were of too low resolution for the ImageNet-pretrained diffusion model, and upsampled versions of these images did not produce good results with DiffStyle. \n\nThere are many options for modifying how the diffusion process works. The first, and simplest ideas would be to change (i) what images are used as \u201cstyle\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d for DiffStyle and (ii) to modify the value of gamma in the DiffStyle generation process (which modifies the style-content proportions). The original DiffStyle paper (Jeong et al. 2023a) evaluates both of these parameters. Rather than search over the parameter space for optimal results, our paper shows that, even with a simple combination of images and default DiffStyle values, our method is effective on some (i.e., CUB and Flowers) datasets for model selection! This is a valuable result on its own and follow-up experiments would be interesting, but are beyond the scope of the current paper."

If our method were able to produce realistic anomalies, then these examples could be added to real validation datasets. \n\nThis highlights the importance of our technique; since we assume a setting where real anomalies are difficult to generate and cannot be reproduced, there is a strong need for synthetic data that can be used to estimate performance, even if they do not visually represent the distribution of anomalies."

We show this result empirically, but for a theoretical result, see Section 3 of this recent paper at ICML 2023  (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shoshan23a/shoshan23a.pdf), which also considers synthetic data for model selection. From Corollary 3.3: \"if the total variation between the real and synthetic distributions is not larger than the synthetic risk difference between a pair of hypotheses, then their error ranking is preserved across domains\".\n\nNote that our work makes far fewer assumptions than that of Shoshan et al. (2023). Their work trains a GAN to generate synthetic data for model selection in each domain, which is a very expensive process. In contrast, our work performs model selection without any training or fine-tuning of a generative model."

It offers no control over what kind of outliers are created. \nCalling it a style and content mixture is dubious, because the method seemingly has no attempted separation into content and style. it seemingly has only 1 latent space.\nThis would also benefit from a more thorough evaluation of creating outliers. e.g. stochastic mixup in latent space, or inpainting, and so on.\n\nAlso it is not clear to what extent the method learns to discriminate real image properties from synthetic ones - this is because the real images are never run through the encoding-decoding step.\n\nThis conclusion is not true:\nIn an extensive empirical study, ranging from natural images to industrial applications, we find that our synthetic validation framework selects the same models and hyper-parameters as selection with a ground-truth validation set.\n\nyes in the simple class vs other classes on flowers and birds it holds, on the more realistic MVTec it does not hold, see their appendix.\n\nIt is not bad per se, if the proposed method does not work, but putting a questionable conclusion in the abstract is misleading.\n\nThe zero-shot task result is interesting scientifically. Practically it is unlikely that one would use that for serious outlier detection tasks."

Note that in DiffStyle, the original image used in the forward pass (the style image) maintains its skip connection values during the backward pass (when the content is injected), so DiffStyle is not symmetric: DiffStyle(x,y) != DiffStyle(y,x)\n- What Figure 3 is showing: We evaluated over five pretrained ResNet models and five pretrained vision transformers (for a total of 10 datapoints per setting). While these settings can be compared to each other (to determine which model is best), what is more important is the relative rankings of these models. Figure three shows that, amongst the ten candidate models, the model with the best performance on our synthetic validation set matches the best performing model on the real validation set.\n- Classifying real vs diffusion-generated images: Figure 3 shows these results. Values on the x-axis are the real-vs-real AUROC values, and values on the y-axis are the real-vs-diffusion-generated AUROC values. We find that the real-vs-diffusion-generated AUROC can be used to select the same models as the real AUROC."
