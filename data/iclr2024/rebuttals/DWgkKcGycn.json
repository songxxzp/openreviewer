Humans would not typically segment anything first when given a scene image. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify this point.\n\n- The motivation of this paper is interesting yet tricky: why can't we retrieve the local scene graph from the global scene graph? What is the advantage of directly generating a local scene graph? If the aim is to align with human perception, why is the foveated view not applied to the input scene? \n\n- I found the novelty in this work is limited: local SGG task is derived from conventional global SGG task and the proposed system seems like a trivial effort to combine different foundation models.\n\n- Lack of comparison: The new task and framework proposed in this paper do not appear to be exclusive. There is a possibility that such a framework could be used for what is referred to as \"global SGG,\" or that models designed for global SGG could also perform this local SGG task. The former is reported in Table 2. I am curious about how well other global open-vocabulary SGG models perform the local SGG task [1-2].\n\n- The analysis of experiments lacks depth. There are not many key takeaways beyond performance metrics. Additionally, figures 3-4 are less informative since open-vocabulary SGG, of course, generates more diverse triplets.\n\n[1] Towards open-vocabulary scene graph generation with prompt-based finetuning, He et al, 2022.\n\n[2] Learning to Generate Language-supervised and Open-vocabulary Scene Graph using Pre-trained Visual-Semantic Space, Zhang et al, 2023."

Connecting Foundational model to scene graphs.** Scene Graphs have traditionally been tested on in-dataset samples such as Visual Genome or GQA. With the rise of foundational models, the open-vocabulary potential of scene graphs have risen and this paper is one of the foremost approaches in that direction. \n\n**3. New task of scene graph generation.** Scene graphs are complex-natured entities compared to low-level object detection. Therefore, different tasks involving scene graph generation would help different researchers to concentrate on different parts. This paper's novel task creates one of such doors of exploration. Agreeing with the authors, I strongly believe the local scene graphs should be emphasized in future research since humans often look at a single entity and would like to reason its connections to other entities."

In Table 1, observer, thinker, and verifier models are borrowed from the already established model. Therefore, the claim of 'Ours' in Table 2 and Table 3 is significantly weak. This whole reliance on the off-the-shelf models makes this paper a well-written technical report of a good engineering project, but not a novel research paper."
