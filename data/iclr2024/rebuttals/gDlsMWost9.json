                    "value": "The paper introduces an approach titled \"Multimodal-CoT,\" which focuses on the amalgamation of both language (text) and vision (images) modalities in a two-stage framework. The first stage addresses rationale generation, while the second concentrates on answer inference. An important feature of this paper is its strategy of integrating vision features into the language model. Such a technique, though previously explored in multimodal language and vision models, is shown to decrease rationale hallucination and consequently boost answer accuracy."

This alternative is more like a standard CoT approach. The authors are encouraged to compare with this baseline.\n\n2. **Additional Benchmark Results:** For a holistic understanding, it would be beneficial to see the results of \"UnifiedQA,\" \"FLAN-T5,\" and \"FLAN-Alpaca\" in Table 6.

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful review and constructive feedback.\n\n> W1: Incremental Novelty.\n\nCompared with previous techniques, our work is in sharp contrast with the following three aspects. \n\nFirstly, this work is the first to study CoT reasoning in different modalities among existing publications. \n\nSecondly, as a pioneer and effective approach to deal with the multimodal CoT problem, our technique is different from either previous text-only reasoning or VQA approaches by providing a means of explicit intermediate reasoning with multimodal input powered by a frozen image encoder and two-stage framework. \n\nThirdly, our two-stage approach elicits the analysis of why the naive way of employing CoT fails in the context and how incorporating vision features alleviates the problem. The approach has been shown generally effective across tasks and backbone models. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth studies to investigate the benefits and limitations of Multimodal-CoT to facilitate future studies.\n\n> W2: Framework Design.\n\nWe explore the framework design to gain insights in the following ways.\n\nFirstly, we have tried intricate alignment strategies inspired by BLIP, i.e., Image-grounded text encoder according to Section 3.1 in BLIP. This alignment approach injects visual information by inserting one additional cross-attention layer between the self-attention layer and the feed-forward network for each transformer block of the text encoder. Our current strategy in the paper is similar to the Unimodal encoder as in BLIP, which is used for comparison. We see that using other alignment strategies also contributes to better performance than direct answering.\n\n| Method | Accuracy |\n| ---------- | ---------------- |\n| Direct Answering | 82.62 |\n| Unimodal encoder | 85.31 | \n| Image-grounded text encoder | 84.60  | \n\nSecondly, we explore the possibilities of intexegrating Multimodal-CoT with more complex models. We find that our method is orthogonal to existing multimodal models (e.g., InstructBLIP) and can be potentially used with them together to further improve generality. We have provided a detailed discussion in Appendix C.3.  \n\n> Q1: Differentiation from CoT.\n\nGreat point. Our preliminary motivation is to adopt QCM->RA. However, the performance is much inferior than direct reasoning (QCM->A) as shown in Table 2. Our observation is that the \"X->RA\" strategy (we replace \"QCM->RA\" to \"X->RA\" for the sake of generality) is beneficial when the model can generate effective rationales, e.g., the standard CoT approach in complex reasoning tasks such as arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks. \n\nHowever, we find that the rationales in our tasks often contain commonse or logical mistakes according to our error analysis (similar to our case studies in Appendix D, as a reference). When using the rationales in the output side (RA), the decoder would generates the answer conditioned on the previously generated rationales. In this way, the answer generation may more likely suffer from the imperfect rationales. In contrast, when taking the rationales in the input side, the rationale will not directly affect the answer generation process of the decoder and the model may also easily ignore the imperfect rationales. \n\nThis finding also applies to the in-context learning baselines with few-shot demonstrations. According to the results in [1], GPT-3 also yields inferior performance with X->RA.\n\n| Method | Accuracy |\n| ---------- | ---------------- |\n| X -> A | 74.0 | \n| X -> AR | 73.6 |\n| X -> RA | 55.4 | \n\nTherefore, we finally adopt the two-stage framework and finally succeeds in improved performance.\n\n> Q2: Additional Benchmark Results.\n\nYes. We have added the detailed benchmark results in Appendix C5. \n\nReference:\n\n[1] Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tony Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan.

While these datasets are relevant and challenging, the paper represents a specific type of reasoning tasks.\"\n\nWe adopt the ScienceQA and A-OKVQA datasets for evaluation because they have annotated rationales as golden labels to assess the quality of the generated rationales and to have an in-depth study on the problem of multimodal CoT, though the annotations are dispensable in real use. Our results compellingly show the feasibility of adaptation to scenarios even without human-annotated rationales, thereby establishing the effectiveness of our approach across diverse tasks.Please also note that ScienceQA is a large-scale multimodal QA benchmark that covers rich domain diversity across 3 subjects, 26 topics, 127 categories, and 379 skills. \n\nIndeed,  these datasets are relevant and challenging. It is worth noting that existing publications only used one of the datasets for evaluation. In contrast, we have taken both of them to verify the effectiveness of Multimodal-CoT [1-5].\n\n> W2: \"The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method primarily in the context of encoder-decoder models. However, its effectiveness in popular left-to-right language models, which are widely used, is not explicitly addressed.

Firstly, encoder-decoder architecture is also widely adopted as multimodal framework in this research field. Secondly, existing studies [6] have already compared the performance between encoder-decoder architecture (T5) and left-to-right decoder-only architecture (LLaMA/Vinuca). The results show that T5 achieves better performance on most of the tasks.  In addition, we have adopted various left-to-right language models as baselines presented in Table 4, including LLaMA-Adapter, LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon. Results show that our approach, with less than 1B parameters, perform better than most of those latest work. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Liangke Gui, Borui Wang, Qiuyuan Huang, Alex Hauptmann, Yonatan Bisk, Jianfeng Gao.

For instance, more rigorous experiments are needed to claim surpassing human performance: on the one hand, humans can show significant variances when working on the same problem; on the other hand, ScienceQA collects the human performance baseline with Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is quite hard to control the data quality.\"\n\nYes, we agree. We report human performance following the original ScienceQA paper. It can be seen as a piece of evidence to indicate the superior performance of our approach as it is the first to suppose human performance. Due to the lack of details in human evaluations in the ScienceQA paper, we could not elaborate on how the model surpasses human performance in specific artifacts. To avoid confusion, we have removed those arguments.\n\n> W2: \"This paper overclaims on multimodal CoT, while only vision and text are evaluated. Other modalities, such as audio, video, and touch, are not supported in the model.\"\n\nWe call Multimodal basically following a wide range of existing studies that focus on vision and language modalities and the framework is generally applicable to other modalities. Following the comment, we have added a clarification in Footnote 1.\n\n> W3: \"A few points are not clear enough (see below for details).\"\n\n- Q1: It's surprising that a model with a FLAN-Alpaca-Base backbone can outperform GPT-4 (Table 4). Is the GPT-4 you tested multimodal or text-only? Did you use CoT prompting for GPT-4 as well?\n\nIt is a text-only GPT-4. It is based on CoT prompting according to [1].\n\n- Q2: Related to the above question, shouldn't multimodal-CoT be considered as a prompting technique, which is orthogonal to the base model? If so, the references in Table 4 are probably misleading.\n\nWe are afraid not. Multimodal-CoT is a fine-tuned model. As we discussed in Section 1, prompting and fine-tuning are two potential solutions for Multimodal-CoT. The prompting results are reported for reference. In contrast, fine-tuning approaches generally achieve better performance and are widely adopted by related studies (those latest baselines).\nTherefore, we choose the fine-tuning paradigm to design Multimodal-CoT and focus on the compairon with fine-tuning approaches.\n\n[1] Pan Lu, Swaroop Mishra, Tony Xia, Liang Qiu, Kai-Wei Chang, Song-Chun Zhu, Oyvind Tafjord, Peter Clark, and Ashwin Kalyan.

It is worth noting that Multimodal-CoT keeps state-of-the-art performance for over several months after release and LLaVA takes our approach as the major baseline for comparison.\n\n> W2: \"It would be better to add more explanation or motivation about separating the reasoning process into two-stage works.\"\n\nYes. We have added more explanation when introducing the model. The key motivation is the anticipation that the answer inference can leverage better generated rationales that are based on multimodal information. By separating the training stages, we are able to obtain more effective rationales by training a specific rationale generation model. Then, the effective rationales are used to predict the final answer. In contrast, as results reported in Table 2, modeling the reasoning process by combining the rationale and answer (RA or AR) would lead to inferior results. \n\n> Q: Typos Grammar Style And Presentation Improvements.\n\nThanks for the comments. We have fixed the typo. We have updated the Appendix to comply with the latest version of the paper."
