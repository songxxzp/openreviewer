The idea is to compute second-order updates of the loss with respect to the model output, and then back-propagating those to the parameters using standard first-order methods. This can be viewed as replacing the original loss with a new quadratic loss around the minimizer of a quadratic approximation of the original loss, which the authors refer to as a Newton Loss.\n\nTwo possible second-order methods are presented for approximating the original loss around a batch of model outputs, based on either the Hessian or the empirical Fisher, leading to two possible instantiations of Newton losses. Both methods are regularized with Tikhonov regularization, which controls the influence of the Newton loss compared to standard gradient descent.\n\nThe implementation is shown to be simple for the Hessian Newton Loss, which requires accessing and inverting the Hessian, and even simpler for the Fisher Newton Loss, which only requires minor modifications to the implementation of standard gradient descent.\nTwo weakly-supervised problem settings are considered, namely MNIST digit sorting and Warcraft shortest paths. In these settings 8 algorithmic losses are compared to their Newton loss counterparts. Both the Fisher and the Hessian Newton Loss are shown to yield improved performance, with the margin depending on the difficulty of the algorithmic loss function as well as the quality of the Hessian approximation."

It would also be a useful addition to include an ablation study of how sensitive the performance is to this hyper-parameter for one of the experimental setups.\n- In figure 3, does the plot show the number of training epochs on the x-Axis? It seems like this information is missing. This plot could also benefit from averaging over all seeds and including the standard deviations.\n- In the proof of Lemma 3, does getting from equation 22 to the final expression require some assumptions on commutativity of the involved matrices?

The main idea is to split the computing of the loss function in a superposition of two functions and update the corresponding parameters in an alternating manner. In particular, Newton method update is used for the first function and the standard SGD-like update is used for the second one. Also, such splitting at least preserves stationary points of the initial loss function. In Newton's method, both the exact Hessian matrix and the Fisher matrix are considered to precondition the gradient.  The authors provide pseudocode on how to incorporate the proposed approach in PyTorch-like code. The experiments demonstrate that Newton Losses lead to higher test accuracy for sorting supervision losses and shortest-path supervision."

Matrix inversion is the numerically unstable operation in the ill-conditioned case, see (Higham, 1993 - https://eprints.maths.manchester.ac.uk/346/1/covered/MIMS_ep2006_167.pdf). This issue may be crucial in the single-precision format which is typically used in deep learning. In addition, storage of the full square matrix with a dimension equal to the number of model parameters can be prohibited for large models. Thus, this step in the proposed method lacks detailed analysis and requires more in-depth investigation in terms of scalability and robustness to round-off errors. For example, the iterative methods for solving large symmetrix linear systems can exploit hessian-by-vector product operation without explicitly composing the hessian matrix due to automatic differentiation tools. Also, the linear systems in the optimizing first function can be solved with different tolerances in the Inexact Newton method manner, which may significantly affect both runtime and final performance."

Please, provide more details regarding the mentioned learning problems' features.\n3) the presented runtime analysis in Supplementary B confuses me since in some cases the proposed method with additional costs per iteration is faster than the baseline. Please provide a more detailed description of the reason for such a result. Also, I disagree that the inversion of the matrix is inexpensive since it is $O(n^3)$ complexity and it is small only for the small dimension $n$. Therefore, we again come to question 1) on the scalability of the proposed method\n4) the authors report only mean values of the target metrics in the main text.
