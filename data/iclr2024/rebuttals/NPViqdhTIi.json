                    "value": "In \"Parameter-free Molecular Classification and Regression with Gzip\", the authors investigate the applicability of a recently proposed text representation method based on Gzip compression (by Jiang et al.) for cheminformatics applications. The core concept involves comparing the compressed lengths of concatenations of pairs of strings, with the assumption that concatenations of similar strings are more compressible than those of dissimilar strings. This enables the definition of a \"distance\" between strings, which can then be utilized in standard learning algorithms like $k$-nearest neighbors. The authors of the present paper apply this idea to text-based molecular representations (e.g. SMILES strings) to perform various classification and regression tasks, e.g. predicting binding affinities or toxicity. They compare two Gzip-based methods (MolZip and MolZip-Vec) to various deep neural network-based methods on a range of benchmarks. Their findings demonstrate that the parameter-free Gzip-based methods achieve competetive results, sometimes even surpassing the more complex deep learning-based approaches."

An aspect of the paper which I find particularly commendable is the authors' transparency when it comes to the reported results. For example, even though they could get improved results for regressions tasks with slight modifications to their method (augmenting the text descriptor with additional SMILES strings representing the same molecule), they still chose to report \"baseline numbers\" in tables with performance comparisons, so that results between regression and classification tasks are compatible."

Is it because compression-based text representations for molecules are surprisingly powerful, or is it because the tasks themselves are actually very simple to solve, i.e., deep learning-based methods are simply overengineered? I believe the paper would be greatly improved if this question was answered conclusively."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. The definition of normalised compression distance (NCD) feels unintuitive to me. For reference, it is given as:\n$$\nNCD(x,y) = \\frac{C(xy) - \\min\\\\{C(x), C(y)\\\\}}{\\max\\\\{C(x), C(y)\\\\}}\n$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the compressed length of the string $x$ and $xy$ denotes the concatenation of strings $x$ and $y$. I calculated the NCD for the SMILES strings\n- $x_1$: `'CC(C)CC(C(=O)O)N'` (leucine)\n- $x_2$: `'CCC(C)C(C(=O)O)N'` (isoleucine)\n- $x_3$: `'C1=CC=C(C=C1)N'` (aniline)\n- $x_4$: `'C1=CC=C2C=CC=CC2=C1'` (naphthalene)\nand arrived at the distance matrix\n$$\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0.088 & 0.176 & 0.441 & 0.457 \\\\\\\\\n 0.118 & 0.088 & 0.441 & 0.457 \\\\\\\\\n 0.382 & 0.382 & 0.094 & 0.286 \\\\\\\\\n 0.429 & 0.457 & 0.343 & 0.086\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nwith $D_{ij} = NCD(x_i, x_j)$. While the entries generally make sense to me (e.g. leucine is closer to isoleucine than it is to aniline), it becomes immediately apparent that the NCD is not a proper metric. For example, $NCD(x_i, x_j) \\neq NCD(x_j, x_i)$ (not symmetric) and $NCD(x_i, x_i) > 0$ (the distance from a point to itself is not zero). To me, it seems like these properties should negatively impact the performance of algorithms like $k$-nearest neighbors.\nA relatively simple alternative definition given by\n$$\nNCD(x,y) = \\frac{0.5[C(xy) + C(yx)] - \\min\\\\{C(xx), C(yy)\\\\}}{\\max\\\\{C(xx), C(yy)\\\\}}\n$$\ninstead leads to the distance matrix\n$$\nD = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0.000 & 0.054 & 0.297 & 0.329 \\\\\\\\\n 0.054 & 0.000 & 0.297 & 0.342 \\\\\\\\\n 0.297 & 0.297 & 0.000 & 0.211 \\\\\\\\\n 0.329 & 0.342 & 0.211 & 0.000\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nWhile this is still not a proper metric (nothing guarantees that non-identical points have a distance larger than zero and the triangle inequality probably does not hold), it at least has more of the desired properties. Can the authors comment on the definition used in the paper and why it is used? If possible, I would appreciate some experiments with the more \"metric-like\" definition. Does it work better in practice? If not, can the authors give reasons why the definition given in the paper works better?\n(Note: I understand that the authors took the definition of the NCD from Jiang et al. and did not come up with it themselves, but I hope they can still answer my questions.)\n\n2. I think the paper would benefit from additional \"simple baselines\", so that it becomes clearer whether compression-based methods are surprisingly good, or the investigated problems are just surprisingly simple to solve (see Weaknesses). I could imagine a descriptor inspired by Bag of Bonds (see 10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00831) as a simple baseline: For example, a water molecule might be described by the vector `[2 0 1 0 2 0]` and a methane molecule by `[4 1 0 4 0 0]`, where the entries `[#H #C #O #CH #OH #CO]` correspond to atom (e.g. `#H`: number of hydrogen atoms) and bond (e.g. `#CH`: number of C-H bonds) counts (this descriptor can be trivially extended to more atom/bond types). As a \"distance metric\", I suspect cosine similarity might work well for this kind of descriptor (probably better than Euclidean distance).\n\n3. Related to the point above: For MolZip-Vec, a vector of 200 molecular descriptors is converted to a string (by binning numerical values and translating them to non-ASCII characters), and appended to the SMILES string. This seems to be particularly effective for regression tasks. How does a simple baseline, e.g. linear regression on the raw vector of molecular descriptors, perform? Alternatively, have the authors considered using e.g. the cosine similarity between the raw vectors of molecular descriptors as a distance metric (instead of the NCD)? What's the performance?"

MoleculeNet is small and can be easily obtained online. Similarly, the gzip method is quite simple to code. This experiment seems like < 1 week of work. To me, these results are more suitable for a blog post or a workshop than as a paper in a top-tier ML conference.\n- Poor presentation: I felt that the paper was not well-written. To me, the sensible structure for such a paper would be to describe the method of Jiang et al 2022, describe how it was modified for molecules, present experimental results, then discuss impact. Instead, the paper presents experimental results, then only describes how the method differs from Jiang et al 2022 without describing that method. I think the paper is not readable as a standalone document in its current form: the reader would also need to read Jiang et al 2022 in order to understand this paper.\n- Doesn't consider classical baselines: this paper seems to generally mirror the narrative of Jiang et al 2022 which compares gzip against large fine-tuned language models. While such a narrative seems appropriate for NLP, machine learning for molecules is dominated by small datasets where the performance of classical methods is competitive (e.g. SVM or KNN on molecular fingerprints). I think the paper should discuss this and include results from classical baselines. My guess is that the gzip KNN's performance is not too different to the performance of KNN on fingerprints (using an appropriate distance metric for fingerprints such as Jaccard distance).\n- Paper does not contain error bars on any experiments, despite all methods clearly containing randomness. Therefore the significance of performance differences is unclear. In my experience working with these datasets the standard deviations were quite high."

The comparison is performed only against ChemBERTa-1, ChemBERTa-2 and Grover. These are not the state of the art methods for these tasks. While the authors cite state of the art methods like Molformer-XL, no comparison is done against these methods. And when compared to even simpler methods like SVM on molecular fingerprints, the performance of the proposed method is not better. For example on the BACE task, SVM has an AUROC of 86.2 whereas Molzip has an AUROC of 66.7 (Numbers are from the Molformer-XL paper). In fact, in the BACE task, all the methods compared in the Molformer-XL paper (are better than MolZip. In the BBBP task, the best performance of Molzip is 69.2 whereas all the baseline methods (again taken from the Molformer-XL paper) are better than Molzip (with the exception of Chemberta), with Molformer-XL achieving 93.7 AUROC.\n\nSimilar statements can be made about the regression task as well.\n\nIt is generally expected gzip will have some predictive power as it internally builds a statistical model on the textual features. This paper does not show that the performance of the method is much better than that expectation."

                    "value": "For Tox-21, only one task (out of the 12 tasks) is considered.  Any reason for this?\n\nAs a general suggestion, I would advocate for a more thorough comparison with other methods. That will help the reader understand the performance of this method in relation to other methods. Right now, the paper presents a very misleading picture on performance."
