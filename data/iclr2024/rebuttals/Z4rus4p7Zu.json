                    "value": "This paper considers accelerating the sampling processes of a number of existing ODE solvers (including both 1st and high order ODE solvers) for small NFEs. The basic idea is to optimize a scalar parameter lambda_i in front of a gradient vector per timestep t_i for approximating the ODE integration over [t_i, t_{i-1}]. The optimization for lambda_i is performed by solving a quadratic optimization problem which measures the difference between the estimated diffusion state x_{i-1} obtained via the student ODE solver and that obtained by the teacher ODE solver with much larger number of timesteps.  By doing so, the integration approximation accuracy for the student ODE solver should be improved. Experiments on FID evaluation confirm the effectiveness of the new method."

The arXiv paper considered improving the sampling performance of EDM, DDIM, DPM-Solver, and SPNDM for small NFEs.  One main difference between the two papers is that the arXiv paper considered optimizing a number of coefficients in front of some gradient vectors per diffusion timestep rather than one coefficient as being optimized in this paper. Furthermore, the gradient vectors considered in the arXiv paper can be functions of estimated Gaussian noises or estimated clean data.       \n\nIt seems that the authors of this paper is not aware of the arXiv paper at all."

For example, the **$D_t$ and $D_\\theta$ are not defined in the main text**, so that I cannot understand the main method until I carefully read the appedix. Please add a rigorous defination of the \"denoising prediction\".\n  - Lack of a detailed discussion with multi-step ODE solvers, such as DEIS[1] and DPM-Solver++[2]. In fact, the proposed linear combination of current step and the previous step is exactly the core idea of the multi-step solvers. If we choose $D_\\theta$ and $D_t$ as the original network (i.e., noise-pred for DEIS or data-pred for DPM-Solver++), the proposed method is almost equivalent to them, except for the requirements for estimating the linear coefficients. Besides, the main advantage of multi-step solvers is that they are more robust and have less discretization errors when using fewer steps, that's why DEIS and DPM-Solver++ outperform other single-step solvers. It seems that the main improvement in this work is exactly the multi-step paradigm.\n  - The D-DEIS in the appendix seems to be very tricky, because it uses the combination of the \"linear combination of noise-pred network\", not the combination of the noise-pred network. Why use this setting? Is there any principle for choosing $D_t$ and $D_\\theta$?\n  - In Sec.4.2, please also compare with DPM-Solver++ because it is based on data-prediction model.\n- Minor:\n  - The writing for a vector-valued variable or function should be consistent. For example, please both use the bold format for the noise variable and the noise-pred network in Eq(6), and similarly for the data-pred network in Eq(7).\n\n\n\n[1] Zhang, Qinsheng, and Yongxin Chen. \"Fast sampling of diffusion models with exponential integrator.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.13902* (2022).\n\n[2] Lu, Cheng, et al. \"Dpm-solver++: Fast solver for guided sampling of diffusion probabilistic models.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01095* (2022)."

Why DEIS use the combination of noise-pred networks for the \"denoising prediction\", but not use the noise prediction network itself? Are there any differences? In my opinion, \"the combination of noise-pred networks\" have larger errors because, for example, if we use DEIS-2 for time t, t-1, then the combination involves time t, t-1, t-2, which corresponds to DEIS-3.
