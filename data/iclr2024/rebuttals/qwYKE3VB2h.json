But are these conditions sufficient? Is there any theoretical justification for that?\n2. The clique-sampler tries to sample for as many as possible hyperedges. Will it not affect the size of hyperedges being predicted?\n3. The performance of the proposed method is not very different from the baselines on hypergraphs where the average hyperedge size is large. Is there any justification for that? Also, from the predicted hyperedges, is it possible to provide a stratified evaluation to understand how the proposed method works on large vs small hyperedges?\n4. Can you think of a real-world scenario where converting a graph to a hypergraph (where we know that there are underlying group interactions) is essential, and this approach can help?\n5. Apart from clique-based projections, there are other hypergraph projection methods, such as the node-degree-preserving method[4]. Can this approach recover hyperedges from such projected graphs?\n\n\n6. I request the authors to provide justification for the following.\na. In the Introduction section, whether the hyperedges are observable or not actually depends on the objective of experiments conducted on the system. For example, protein-protein, gene-gene interactions have semantics defined for pairwise interactions where protein complexes are inherently super-dyadic relations of proteins, and experiments observe them in the protein complex form [1].\nb. Unpublished: True, author-author interaction datasets do not provide the underlying hypergraph structure, but one should go with other bibliographic datasets such as AMiner[2] to get a complete view of the system.\nc. Relevance to the hyperedge prediction problem: The problem of hyperedge prediction is actually relevant. The hyperedge prediction methods consume a hypergraph as input, and the right way to see it is every graph is also a hypergraph (more precisely, 2-uniform hypergraph), and the methods [3] where a set of candidate hyperedges is not used can identify underlying hyperedges. Especially when you are using the sample hypergraphs from a given domain, methods like HPRA can generate new hyperedges using the known hyperedge degree distribution.\n\n\n[1] \"Hypergraphs and cellular networks.\" PLoS computational biology 5.5 (2009): e1000385.\n[2] https://www.arnetminer.org/\n[3] \"HPRA: Hyperedge prediction using resource allocation.\" Proceedings of the 12th ACM Conference on Web Science. 2020.\n[4]  \"Hypergraph clustering by iteratively reweighted modularity maximization.\" Applied Network Science 5.1 (2020): 1-22."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the feedback. We have revised our paper following the reviewer\u2019s suggestions. Here are our answers to the questions.\n\n\n\n**Question 1** \n\nConditions stated in Theorem 1 are stated as both necessary and sufficient conditions, as indicated by the \u201cif and only if\u201d in Theorem 1. If the reviewer is mainly concerned about the text below Theorem 1 that explains its significance, we have added the phrase ``necessary and sufficient\u201d to avoid confusion. We have also updated our proof in Appendix B.1 to highlight that both directions are true.\n \n \n**Question 2**\n\nThe clique-sampler indeed samples as many hyperedges as possible since it needs to maximize its utility objective under the budget constraint.  We design the sampling mechanism, however, to positively affect the size of hyperedges, i.e., making their sizes diverse and in line with the distribution in the training hypergraph.  This is accomplished by our Algo.1: Appendix F.2.1 elaborates on this, with additional numerical results obtained on DBLP; Table 7 is also very helpful as it examines more properties of reconstructions. Below is a short summary:\n\nIn each iteration, Algo. 1 tends to sample cliques from a different column of Figure 4(a)\u2019s heatmap.  Cliques of the same size have diminishing sampling gain, due to the overlapping of $\\mathcal{E}_{n,k}$\u2019s that have the same $k$. Meanwhile, cliques of different sizes remain unaffected in each sampling iteration. This inherent exclusivity encourages more diverse hyperedge sizes in sampling, which reduces the chance of a skewed size distribution in the reconstruction result. Of course, ultimately the sampling is still guided by the distribution of hyperedges in the training hypergraph.\n\n**Question 3 & Weakness 3**\n\nWe have added a new section, Appendix F.3, to answer this question systematically through a linear regression on the performance gap.  \n\nAs a short summary, we found that (1) our advantage over baselines is most prominent on dense hypergraphs, because dense hypergraphs are usually hardest to reconstruct; (2) our advantage is relatively less prominent on datasets with larger hyperedges, because baselines like max cliques, clique covering, and Bayesian-MDL naturally favor large hyperedge in reconstruction. In these cases, the baseline\u2019s assumption is aligned with the dataset property.\nPlease read F.3 for more details.\n\n**Question 4 & Question 6a**  \n\nAs introduced in Section 5.4 and elaborated in Appendix F.4, a realistic use case we have demonstrated is multiprotein complex reconstruction. This is a widely-studied application that naturally fits the motivation for hypergraph reconstruction, since it is a case where some of the most readily available measurement technologies can only record pairwise interactions in a system that is fundamentally composed of hyperedges.  In particular, we understand the reviewer\u2019s point that it can be an experimental choice as to whether one should detect protein interactions as pairs or groups, but as we elaborate in Appendix F.4, pair-based detection methods such as Y2H are much more accessible and faster than group-based detection methods such as TAP-MS. As a result, a large amount of the data so far generated from protein interaction studies have come from Y2H screenings. This often leads to a realistic demand for researchers to recover groups (hyperedges) from pair detection results. Please refer to Appendix F.4 for more details.\n \n \n**Question 5**\n\nYes. Our approach can also recover hyperedges from the novel node-degree-preserving projection, with even better performance than under this paper\u2019s harsh setting. We have added a section in Appendix F.10 to elaborate on this.\n\n\n\n \n**Question 6b**\n\nIt would certainly be most ideal if one could cross-reference other bibliographic datasets. However, since almost all popular co-authorship networks (e.g. obgl-arxiv, Arxiv Hep-Th) have anonymized node identifiers for privacy issues, it is often very difficult to even figure out the actual author that each node represents. In the meantime, directly reaching out to data publishers to request for the source takes significant time and effort, and usually still runs into the same privacy issues. In these cases, hypergraph reconstruction becomes a much more economic and feasible choice.\n\n**(to continue)**"

                        "value": "**(Continued)**\n\n**Question 6c**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the suggested HPRA method is relevant, and we have added it as a baseline for comparison (see the updated Table 3). \n\nHPRA is a novel method for hyperedge prediction, and it addresses the huge search space of hyperedges very well. It also has the advantage of being lightweight, interpretable, and requiring no tuning at all. As Table 3 shows, the HPRA is a strong baseline that achieves competitive performance among other baselines. However, we still observe a gap in its performance with our proposed method for hypergraph reconstruction, for two reasons:\n\n-  HPRA does not reconstruct all hyperedges from scratch. Instead, it requires at least 80% - 90 % of the hyperedges to already exist in the test hypergraph (See \u201cEvaluation of HPRA\u201d in Section 4 of its paper, where they use 5-fold or 10-fold split). When we treat edges in the projected graph as 2-uniform hyperedges, this violates the underlying assumption that the hypergraph to predict (reconstruct) is ``almost\u2019\u2019 complete, leading to two issues:\n\n    -  Forcing HPRA to reconstruct from scratch causes its errors in the early stage of reconstruction to quickly accumulate. Notice that HPRA\u2019s prediction of each new hyperedge depends on its previous predictions, i.e., it is self-regressing.\n\n    - Treating the hypergraph as a 2-uniform graph significantly alters the assumed hypergraph structure. In other words, it essentially degrades the hypergraph predictions into samplings from the landing probabilities of random walks on the projected graph.\n\n- HPRA uses the training hypergraph (\u201cobserved hyperedges\u201d) in a limited way. It mainly learns about the size distribution of hyperedges from the training hypergraph. In comparison, our method not only learns about size distributions (via $\\rho(n,k)$\u2019s), but more importantly learns from the fine-grained statistics about hyperedges\u2019 locations, as well as the location\u2019s intricate correlation with their surrounding structures.\n\n\n \n**Weakness 1**\n\nPlease see our answers to Question 5 and 6.\n\n**Weakness 2**\n\nWe have followed the reviewer's suggestion to add a paragraph in Introduction, which summarizes our contributions in this paper.\n\nWe summarize the contributions of the proposed pipeline as follows. In parenthesis, we also paste excerpts from the text of our paper where the novelty and originality of the design are emphasized. Our contributions of the proposed pipeline are:\n - The entire paradigm of learning-based hypergraph reconstruction (Sec.4, outline: \u201cThis section will introduce a new learning-based hypergraph reconstruction paradigm. The idea is that \u2026\u201d)\n-  The idea of reconstructing hyperedges by combining budgeted sampling and clique classification (Sec. 4.2: \u201cthe novel idea here is that \u2026\u201d)\n- The entire design of the $\\rho(n,k)$ statistic; (Sec. 4.2.1: \u201cWe start by introducing an important statistic that we found \u2026\u201d)\n- The entire clique sampler, including the objective, optimization algorithm, etc. (Sec. 4.2.2: \u201cwe create a clique sampler \u2026\u201d)\n- The entire design of the hyperedge classifier based on \u201cclique motifs\u201d\n- All count features used in the hyperedge classifier, except features 2,3,7, are new contributions of our paper. Features 2,3,7 are very commonly used count features.\n\nTo further address the reviewer\u2019s concern, we have revised our writing to reflect the novelty of the last two bullet points above.\n \n**Weakness 3**\n\nPlease see our answer to Question 3\n\n**Weakness 4**\n\nPlease see our answers to the Questions.\n\nWe have also fixed the typo, and we appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out."

In particular, the authors identify two necessary and sufficient conditions for the recovery of the hypergraph from G: (1) the lack of any \"nested\" hyper-edges, and (2) the lack of any \"uncovered triangles\" (Thm 1). Moreover, when (2) is not satisfied, the reconstruction accuracy using maximal cliques can be exponentially small in the number of hyper-edges (Thm 3). \n\nThe second main contribution is a learning-based approach that leverages side information in the form of same-domain hypergraphs to reconstruct a hypergraph from its projection. The method follows a 4-step procedure. First, the distribution of hyper-edges within maximal cliques of G is computed for the training data (the known hypergraph of the same domain); these are denoted by the $\\rho(n,k)$'s. Using this information, cliques in G are sampled  in a way that is optimized for the $\\rho(n,k)$'s and a query budget (since the total search space is very large). Finally, cliques are classified as hyperedges or not based on the local structure of the cliques with respect to the surrounding graph. The methodology is assessed on a variety of datasets with favorable results."

The motivation for studying cliques is clear, and the authors derive a nice, fundamental characterization for general hypergraph recovery using maximal cliques. The authors' development of a scalable, learning-based approach to overcome the shortcomings of an approach without side information serves as a nice, practical complement to the theoretical results."

Here are our answers to the questions.\n\n**Weakness**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer to discuss more about future directions. We have followed the advice to add an entire section, \u201cMore Discussions on Limitations and Future Work\u201d, in Appendix G.\n \n**Question 1**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer. We have added to our manuscript this explicit connection between uncovered triangles and hyper-edge reconstruction \u2013 see highlighted text under Theorem 2.  We would also like to point to the caption of Figure 2, where we presented a concrete example of how the uncovered triangle fails hyperedge reconstruction.\n \n**Question 2**\n\nWe have counted on the \u201c(Edge) Clique Covering\u201d baseline to outperform the \u201cMax Cliques\u201d baseline. As introduced in Appendix C.2, \u201cClique Covering\u201d is a classical algorithmic problem that aims to use the least number of cliques to cover all the edges of the projected graph.  This is a very natural baseline for reconstructing hyperedges. This is also the only baseline that strictly enforces the principle of parsimony --  a popular rule of thumb in science. Therefore, we thought it should perform better than max cliques.\nIn practice, our experimental results in Table 3 show that \u201cClique Covering\u201d does outperform \u201cMax Cliques\u201d on 5 out of the 8 datasets.  Meanwhile, however, it also performs very badly on Enron, P.School, and H. School. We conclude that the principle of parsimony is useful in some cases of reconstruction, but not (even close to) good in many others. In fact, we think there may not exist an (unsupervised) strategy that is universally applicable to reconstructing any real-world hypergraphs, which necessitates the introduction of a learning-based reconstruction method.\n \n**Question 3**\n\nWe have followed the advice to fix all notations of E^c in our revised manuscript.\n\nOne direction is to consider propagating the error signal (e.g., loss gradient) from the hyperedge classifier back to the clique sampler. We have appended an additional section, Appendix G, to formulate the challenge in this interesting future direction, as well as a conjectured solution.\n\nAnother direction we may consider is the usage of attributes in the learning-based framework. Our current method targets the most difficult version of the reconstruction problem: we don\u2019t assume nodes or edges to have attributes, and the reconstruction is purely based on leveraging structural information in the projected graph. It would be interesting to think about how we can effectively integrate node attributes into the picture. This is nontrivial though because the projected graph has special clique structures (and with max cliques that we have preprocessed). Therefore, how to conduct graph learning most effectively on these type of clique structures could be something worth exploring."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the feedback. We have revised our paper following the reviewer\u2019s suggestions. Here are our answers to the questions.\n \n**Weakness 1**\n\nFirst, a foundational motivation to study the problem of hypergraph reconstruction is that we have very limited understanding about the consequences of hypergraph projection, a process that implicitly happens very frequently in network analysis. This is a source of concern both conceptually and in applications because we don\u2019t know what we miss when we drastically simplify complex systems involving hypergraphs in this way. We address this question in two fundamental ways: (i) We begin by presenting several theorems to mathematically characterize the consequences of hypergraph projection in general terms (we consider these to be some of our most important findings); and (ii) we study the problem that is the inverse of hypergraph projection, which is hypergraph reconstruction. \n \nRegarding the actual hypergraph reconstruction problem, it has the following benefits:\n\n- The reconstructed hypergraphs themselves are very useful data representations, because they crucially tell us which group of nodes in a projected graph are really interacting with each other at a time. Therefore, the reconstructed hypergraphs can facilitate scientific analysis that are infeasible or less accurate in projected graphs. Examples include analysis of protein complexes and social interactions; in both of these cases, as we discuss in the paper, natural ways of measuring the system produce graph representations for what are in fact hypergraph structures.\n-  The reconstructed hypergraphs also facilitate downstream tasks, though they do not exist for the sole purpose of improving any one specific downstream task. We demonstrate this through the link prediction task. Please read more in our answer to \u201cWeakness 3 & Question 1\u201d.\n-  Even the instances of hypergraph reconstruction that yield poor performance results have value, since they help us identify the classes of hypergraphs for which projection risks causing the greatest amount of information loss.  For example, one interesting finding in our experiment is that hypergraphs with large hyperedges are relatively safer to project, while it is more important to avoid projecting hypergraphs with high node degrees.\n\n\n\n**Weakness 2 & Question 2**\n\nWe have followed the reviewer\u2019s suggestion to add another use case in Appendix F.6, showing reconstructed hypergraph\u2019s benefit in the classical task of node clustering. In particular, we show that the hypergraph reconstruction crucially recovers much information about the higher-order cluster structures in a social interaction network.\nWe believe that the benefits of reconstructed hypergraph in downstream tasks have now been well substantiated by the three concrete use cases: node ranking (F.4), link prediction (F.5), and node clustering (F.6). \n\n\n\n**Weakness 3 & Question 1**\n\nThe improvement on link prediction in Appendix F.4 does originate from the use of additional structural information. However, this is exactly what we have wanted to demonstrate. Without a hypergraph reconstruction method, the classifier for link prediction is unable to use higher-order structural features in the (testing) projected graph. This limitation exists despite the availability of a training hypergraph together as input. This is because there is no mapping between nodes in the testing projected graph and nodes in the training hypergraph. Therefore, we can\u2019t use training hypergraph to construct structural features for nodes in the tested projected graph.\n\nHypergraph reconstruction, on the other hand, creates a mechanism to use information in the training hypergraph when the task is defined on the testing projected graph (by first reconstructing the testing hypergraph).  This is an important sense in which hypergraph reconstruction \u2014 by providing access to an inferred hypergraph structure \u2014 unlocks the potential for using available side information that is not directly compatible with graph structures. \n\nWe also hope to emphasize that we do not intend to compete against the current state-of-the-art method for link prediction. The main purpose of this experiment is to show that the reconstructed hypergraph contains structural information that is useful and handy for many analysis tasks, including link prediction."
