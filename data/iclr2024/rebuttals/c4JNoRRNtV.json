Transformer is often used to model interactions between different parts, such as patches in CV and tokens in NLP. In this study, Transformer is more like another feature extractor, which may be stronger than vanilla MLP.\n\n  - What do query embeddings mean?\n\n  - How do you choose the value of N and C?\n\n  - You mentioned that you tried to replace the Transformer with MLP. What is the Transformer/MLP's parameter number?\n\n- More ablation studies on the experimental dataset are required to show the need for each component.\n\n  - In the homogenous reconstruction experiment (Figure 6, EMPIAR 10028), the model performs slightly better than CryoDRGN. Does this mean that higher resolution results from \"modeling in real space\", rather than \"so many deformation components\"?\n\n  - It is better to test which component contributes the most to the performance gain on the real dataset. Does it come from finetuning the orientation encoder? Does it come from modeling in real space? \n\n  - How does the performance change against the number and channel of query embeddings?\n\n- The 3DFlex's result in Figure 7 has some conflict with my personal experience. I have tested 3DFlex against EMPIAR-10180 and its performance is not as bad as you illustrated in Figure 7."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Major weaknesses:\n- The authors have included a number of baseline comparisons. However, for one of these approaches (Kimanius et al., 2022), the authors have claimed that an implementation for the method does not exist and that they have reimplemented this approach themselves (pg 16). As the results for this method may be affected by subtle differences in the implementation, I **strongly** suggest the authors use the open-source implementation of the paper, which is linked in the methods section of Kimanius et al., 2022 (pg 4).\n- The reconstruction metrics used (apart from the synthetic data case) are very unclear. It should be explained in the main text of the paper what volumes are being compared for the FSC and whether the full pipeline is independent for the half-sets, or if it is only the decoder. Proper metrics for heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction that are only computational and are separated from the underlying biology are lacking and a research question in itself. How exactly these are computed has major ramifications for whether the results of this method are improving over the baselines.\n- It is not clear how important the main contributions of this paper (deformation decoder etc) are versus the improved poses obtained through the framework. The authors should re-run the baselines with the poses that they obtained from their pipeline and mention if that improves results for SFBP and cryoDRGN.\n\nMinor points:\n- At the end of page 1, the authors claim that conventional cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms pick a limited number of classes in 3D classification just to improve the computational burden of the calculation. However, this is not the case. The real bottleneck here is that the more classes that are used, the fewer particles one has for each class. Thus the reconstruction quality is harmed. Please see Nakane et al., 2018.\n- On page 6 in implementation details, it is claimed that SFBP uses cryoSPARC for the initial poses, but it uses RELION.\n\n\n\nCitations:\n- Takanori Nakane, Dari Kimanius, Erik Lindahl, Sjors HW Scheres (2018) Characterisation of molecular motions in cryo-EM single-particle data by multi-body refinement in RELION. eLife\n- Dari Kimanius, Kiarash Jamali, Sjors HW Scheres (2022) Sparse fourier backpropagation in cryo-em reconstruction.

Perhaps directly in the output space of their network in $\\mathbb{S}^2 \\times \\mathbb{S}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$? Were there any optimization issues with this loss?\n- How stable are the pose estimates optimized through this pipeline? I.e. if you save the poses predicted at the end of the reconstruction and then use these as the starting point for another reconstruction with reinitialized weights, do the poses remain stable or do they still change?"

IsoNet, the baseline suggested, is specifically designed for cryo-ET scenarios where the specimen's limited rotation range leads to the 'missing wedge' artifacts in reconstructed volumes. IsoNet is a learning-based method developed to address this particular artifact. Consequently, it may not be an appropriate baseline for single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction tasks, as these two techniques address different challenges and aspects of electron microscopy."

It builds an implicit feature volume directly in the real domain as the 3D representation to facilitate the modeling of local flexible regions. It also proposes a query-based deformation transformer decoder to enhance the quality of reconstruction. The approach can refine pre-computed pose estimations and locate flexible regions. Experimental results show the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods and recent neural methods on both real datasets and synthetic datasets."

                    "value": "The idea of using an implicit feature volume is good and has merit. The query-based transformer decoder to obtain continuous heterogeneous density volume by integrating 3D spatial features with conformational features seems to work well and can model fine-grained structures but also supports highlighting spatial local changes for interpretability. The paper also creates a new synthetic dataset of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) trimeric spike protein,  a primary target for vaccine development and antigen analysis. The dataset would be very useful."
