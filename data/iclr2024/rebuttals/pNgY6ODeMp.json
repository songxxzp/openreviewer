This paper modifies the explanations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) by replacing pre-defined text from CBM with decomposed visual concepts that are not predefined, but instead learned. This method is denoted as Decomposed CBM (DBCM) in the paper.  The decomposed concepts are represented using vectors called CDV (concept decomposition vector). Experiments are conducted on a total of 9 datasets belonging to four types (natural images, semantic images, fine-grained images, and specialized application images)."

Experiments are exhaustive and cover 9 datasets of 4 different types. Although results are not universally improved compared to prior work, having more evidence is useful.\n3. The paper is presented well -- especially the figures 1,2 that provide the overview of the approach/method and help understand the differences with previous methods. The method is also sufficiently explained both in terms of intuition and mathematical/algorithmic formulation.\n4. Sec 4.2 is very informative and the findings and analyses could be useful for future work.\n5. In my opinion, Sec 4.3 is where this paper has the most potential for impact -- in terms of the 6 metrics, CDV clearly outperforms prior methods."

The concept matrix is composed of visual concept vectors corresponding to image-patch + text-phrases in a CLIP latent space (or at least are trained to be) that they hope distinguish classes from one another. To actually \"interpret\" these visual concept vectors (they call CDV), the work proposes either a text composition approach via LLMs or prompt-conditioned segmentation. They test on several small/medium scale datasets and compare against other CBM approaches through a small-scale user study."

I wonder if the authors could've constructed a synthetic dataset (or found an existing one) that further enables validating the approach, and showcases where other methods fail.\n* Looking at the text interpreted results across all examples, the text actually seems highly redundant, e.g. \"brown\" in Fig. 6 or \"material of glass\" in Fig. 5. Likewise, in the image segment interpretations, I couldn't tell qualitatively from the examples how they really distinguished from each other or would give confidence to a model developer, regulator, or user that the model was paying attention to the \"concepts\" that uniquely form the target class that aren't erroneous.\n* The paper presentation was somewhat hard to follow in places (flow, grammar, etc). For example, Fig. 3 I gave up on trying to understand as it ended up confusing me more than just trying to understand the math formalization."

Due to the reliance on pre-defined textual concepts, existing works show compromised interpretability and performance. DCBM seeks to rectify this by learning visual concepts directly from images and employing these for classification tasks. Concept decomposition is executed by projecting image features onto Concept Decomposition Vectors (CDVs), with the aim of distilling critical visual elements integral to the classification. To articulate these concepts across modalities, the paper introduces a quintuple notion of concepts along with a concept-sample distribution technique, positing that this method enhances interpretability in various dimensions such as sparsity, groundability, factuality, fidelity, and meaningfulness."

The DCBM is well-conceived, addressing a recognized gap in interpretable machine learning by leveraging visual concepts that are intrinsically more aligned with the modality of the data being processed. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the interpretability of image classification systems by utilizing concepts that naturally reside within the visual domain, thus allowing for a more intuitive understanding of the model's decision-making process.\n\nCommitment to Empirical Validation: The paper showcases a commendable breadth of experimental work aimed at validating the proposed DCBM framework. The extensive experiments are designed to evaluate the model's performance and interpretability, endeavoring to benchmark against non-interpretable models and other CBMs. Through this exhaustive testing, the research demonstrates a commitment to not just proposing a theoretical model but also to empirically substantiating its effectiveness across several metrics. This extensive experimental evaluation provides a foundation for understanding the practical implications of the proposed method, suggesting its potential to compete with, and possibly exceed, the current state-of-the-art in certain interpretability aspects."

The performance improvement is relatively minor as compared to Labo. Although the interpretability is the key idea, while the user study with 27 users shows significant improvement, the results may be very subjective and sensitive to the selected samples. It is suggested to propose some new metrics that can automatically measure the interpretability.\n3. Important references are missing, e.g., [A] and its subsequent works.
