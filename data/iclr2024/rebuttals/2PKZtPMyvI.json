In particular, the authors estimate the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the different representations, studying its variations across the layers, and as a function of the embedding dimension. It is found that the ID increases with the embedding dimension, and it decreases monotonically from the input to the output.  Moreover, it is  studied  the impact  of using  subsets of the training set on the ID and on the generalisation error."

If this pooling is not performed, the dimension of the representation is equal to the number of tokens times ED, and not to ED. \nThe analysis performed in 3.6 is in principle interesting, but inconclusive (the results in table 5 seem to show that the ID cannot be used as a quality proxy to decide if the learning set can be reduced)\nThe analysis presented in 3.4 is very similar to the one presented in [Ansuini 2019]"

Even if the analysis is performed on different datasets, the monotonic behaviour seems to me at odds with the hypothesis that the first layer of a NN expand the dimension of the representation by getting rid of low-level confounders. Any explanation?\n3) Can the ID really be used to guide the choice of the training set size?\n4) What is  the take-home-message of the observation that the ID grows with the ED?

For example, more sequential learning tasks should be includes, only text classification seems insufficient, such as machine translation which is a typical sequential learning task for Transformer understanding (see more in question part).  \n3.Lack of deep understanding of the observation, for example, increasing the embedding dimension will increase (intrinsic dimension).

Do we have a trade-off between these two important hyper-parameters? The paper states that higher ID usually means lower error rate.  Does this mean that a shallow and wide structure is always better than deep structure for text classification?\n\n2.Comparing to PCA based analysis, the ID derived via TwoNN is substantially small. The paper stated that the learned representation fall in a distinct curved manifold rather than linear subspace. This might be biased since the TwoNN is non-linear analysis tool naturally.\n \n3.In Table 5, the error rates of the model over training sets with full, long and short sequences are similar. This seems counterintuitive especially when training on short sequences. As we know, Transformer is an order-independent learning structure. For sequential learning, we need to add explicit position information (such as position embedding in Standard Transformer used in this paper). Training on short sequences will prevent its generalization ability on longer sequences. However, from Table 5, there is no significant difference between error rate especially for SST2 with diverse lengths.\n\n4. What kind of distance is used in TwoNN for ID computation?\n\n5.

The datasets analyzed consist of input sentences of variable length $l_i$, embedded in $l_i \\times ED$ dimensional spaces by the transformer, where ED is the embedding dimension. The authors are likely applying the TwoNN in a space with a dimension equal to ED. \n\n1. Where do the authors define the strategy to reduce sentences of different lengths to a common ambient space where the Euclidean distances can be computed? \nIn Sec. 3.2 the authors write that \u201cevery piece of input data is sequentially mapped in $n_l$ dimensional vector. \n2. What do they mean by \u201cpiece of input data\u201d: the tokens or the sentences? Is the meaning of hidden dimension $n_l$ different from that of embedding dimension ED? If not, why do they use different names?\n\n**Correlation between ID and accuracy**\nThe authors claim that *an higher terminal feature ID correlates generally correlates with a lower classification error rate* (e.g., Abstract). However, they show incomplete/contradictory evidence about this aspect. In Sec. 3.3, the claim seems valid for AG and IMDB (but the evidence is not robust for SST2). \\\nMore importantly, in Sec. 3.5 they show instead that the *ID of the last layer decreases* when the depth is increased, but they do not report the accuracy. Generally, increasing the transformer depth should also increase the accuracy:\n\n3. Does the accuracy improve making the network deeper? \n\n**Clarification about intrinsic dimension estimate with PCA.**\nThe ID estimate with PCA is usually done by looking for gaps in the eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix. This approach is followed by Ansuini et al., which the authors cite and also widely reported in the technical literature (see e.g. [1-3]). In Sec. 3.4 the authors instead select an arbitrary threshold corresponding to 50% or 85% of the explained variance. \n\n4. How do they justify their approach in this case?\n\n[1] Little et al., Multiscale geometric methods for estimating intrinsic dimension. \\\n[2] Ceruti et al. Intrinsic Dimension Estimation: Relevant Techniques and a Benchmark Framework.\\\n[3] Kaslovsky and Meyer, Overcoming noise, avoiding curvature: Optimal scale selection for tangent plane recovery. \n\n**Rationale of paragraphs 3.6-3.7**\nI have some concerns about the rationale behind paragraphs 3.6-3.7. Decreasing the dataset size deteriorates the performance (especially on the SST2 dataset). The evidence that the sentence IDs do not change with the sentence length does not seem a useful criterion for the data selection.\n\n**Minor suggestions**\n\na. The authors have trained the transformers but do not indicate the hyperparameter setup used (number of epochs, batch size, optimizer, learning rate). They should add this information to the manuscript or in the appendix.\n\nb. The authors should add a link to the code so that others can reproduce the experiments described in the paper. This is now a *de facto* mandatory requirement in this field."

Then, the intrinsic dimension (ID) is the max likelihood estimation of d. (For a formal definition, see Section 2, paragraph \u201cTwoNN Method\u201d on page 3.) \n\nThus, the ID estimation is only meaningful if the following Assumption 1 holds: \n\nAssumption 1: The ratios of close pairwise distances of Transformer representations (approximately) follow the Pareto distribution. \n\nHowever, without further justification, the validity of Assumption 1 is questionable. \n\nAccording to [2], a sufficient condition for Assumption 1 is that the representations are \u201clocally uniform\u201d in density, where \"locally\" means \u201cwithin the range of the second neighbor for each data point\u201d. It is unclear whether this sufficient condition holds for Transformer representations. Nevertheless, note that this is likely not a necessary condition, so there could be other ways to achieve Assumption 1. However, the authors did not check (or even explicitly mention) Assumption 1, which calls into question the validity of the method and the results. \n\nMoreover, [1] states that for ID estimation for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) representations on image data,  \n\n\u201cthe estimated values remain very close to the ground truth ID, when this is smaller than ~20. For larger IDs and finite sample size, the approach moderately underestimates the correct value, especially if the density of data is non-uniform. Therefore, the values reported in the following figures, when larger ~20, should be considered as lower bounds.\u201d\n\nNote that in the current paper under review, most of the estimated IDs are greater than 20 (Figures 1-2, Tables 1-5). Can we trust the estimated IDs by this approach? Do we have evidence that the estimated values remain very close to the ground truth ID for a larger range of IDs (> 20) in the setting of this paper?\n\n\n\noriginality: it seems that the current paper under review mostly used the approach of [1] (which was for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) representations on image data), applying it to Transformers on text classification data. While some observations could potentially be interesting, the main technical contribution of the methodology should be primarily attributed to prior works. \n \n\n\n[1] Intrinsic Dimension of Data Representations in Deep Neural Networks.
