I do not have a background on mechanics, physics, vibrating plates and acoustics; at the same time, I have never worked with operator learning, Fourier neural operators, and frequency domains in the context of artificial intelligence. Therefore, I lack the literature knowledge and experience from both the applied and methodological domain explored in this paper, making it impossible for my review to be useful for a proper evaluation at a conference like ICLR.\n\nI have alerted the ACs to seek an opinion from a different reviewer.\n\n----------------------\nUPDATE: At the author's rebuttal, I was provided to an answer to what was a key weakness I've understood from the paper (seemingly only one test set). Instead, I was given results based on a cross validation procedure that I believe to be reasonable. Based on this, I change my rating from 6 to 8 (accept)."

The Related Work section seems specific and relevant for all the methods and applied area of the paper. It also seems to motivate well the paper.\n3. The experiments (as, for example, seen in table 2) include one more \"traditional\" machine learning model (i.e, kNN). This is quite positive in the context of a area that sometimes forgets to compare new developments with simpler methods that might provide similar results. Although, from what I could understand in Appendix, this is based on an low-dimension embedding from a deep learning autoencoder model.\n4. The paper provides an ablation analysis in Appendix."

For example, it seems to be using Weights & Biases for logging but no explanation on how to use it is provided. Furthermore, the command in the README under \"Train a model\" section is not correct as the paths do not correspond to the folder structure. The setup script does not provide specific versions for the packages being installed (except for pytorch's cuda version) and, thus, this will impact the reproducibility of this work.\n2. The experiment results are conducted in what it seems to be a single test set, and not through some sort of cross validation procedure to understand the variation and relevance of the results depending on the datasets' splits.\n3. The datasets are synthetic, and do not seem to come from real-world measures. I understand from the paper that this is cost prohibitive, and that is why this new dataset is relevant, but I got the impression that this applied domain has implications in the real world, and therefore I'd guess and experiment in a real-world dataset, even if small, would be relevant."

We will incorporate the suggested improvements by updating our readme with instructions, adding version numbers to the requirements.txt and adding an explanation for Weights and Biases setup.\n\n2. **Single Test Set:**\n\nWe follow the common paradigm in deep learning of splitting the data into training/validation and a single test set. To obtain an estimate of the variation we performed cross validation by six trainings with different randomly sampled training and validation splits for the FQO-UNet on the V-5000 setting. The statistics are presented in the following table. \n\n|Evaluation set|MSE|EMD|D[0.25, 0.75]|E_F|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Validation set|0.095 (0.004)|6.15 (0.23)|[0.69 (0.04), 1 (0)]|2.79 (0.02)|\n|Test set|0.094 (0.002)|6.00 (0.13)|[0.72 (0.02), 1 (0)]|2.68 (0.05)|\n\n*Table: Six models were trained on random splits in training and validation sets (4500 and 500 samples respectively). The results are denoted as mean (standard deviation).*\n\nAs we see, the variation across cross-validation runs is reasonably small. When evaluating on the fixed test set containing 1000 samples the variation decreases further.\n\n3. **Synthetic Dataset and Real-World Application:**\n\nReal-world experiments are beyond the scope of this work due to prohibitive costs for manufacturing and measurements of field solutions (a measurement would require laser scanning vibrometry). However, previous research validated the use of the Mindlin model for the plate and errors of the finite element method are well understood in the engineering community [1]. \n\n\nPlease, let us know whether our rebuttal addresses your concerns and if there are further questions.\n\n______\n[1]: Altenbach, Holm, et al.

The construction of the proposed benchmark is well-motivated. I believe that the proposed frequency-domain problem is worth investigating.

This is another strong merit of this paper.\n4. The proposed model is reasonable, and I believe it has some sort of novelty, although the major contribution of this work is in its formulations.\n5.

How easy the plate geometries can be acquired? The proposed beading patterns may not be easily gotten, and probably frequency or speed is probably easy to get. This discussion is required and is essential in this paper.\n\n2. What's the distance between the simulations and the data collected in the real world? If the authors can conduct some experiments on real-world equipment, it would be very great.\n\n3. The mesh geometries in this paper are not represented in vector form, and they are blurred. This should not happen and should be fixed in the rebuttal phase.\n\n4. Why does Table 3 not have baselines' performances? It's better to test baseline methods on the transfer learning setup as well, and this is very critical.\n\n5. It seems that the visualization of Figure 6 is not very good because (b) and (d) are not very similar. Also, I think it's better to add baseline comparisons or even videos (videos can be provided in the supplementary or the anonymous link).\n\n6. The mechanical model should be put into the main text and linked to the dataset construction or methodology. This is very essential in the PDE domain.\n\n7. What do grid-based models mean, and why is FNO not based on grids? I think FNO should have an option to work in regular grids. If grid-based methods are stronger, then FNO should also be put in the similar mode."

                        "value": "We are deeply grateful for your evaluation of our paper and appreciate your recognition of its contribution to the field. Your endorsement, especially given your experience in this domain, is highly encouraging. \n\n\n**Response to suggestions, concerns and questions:**\n\n1. **Plate Geometries Acquisition:**\nWe acknowledge your concern regarding the practical aspects of producing plates with beading patterns. Adding beadings to plates to increase stiffness is an established method (see for example corrugations of tin cans) which can be conducted by stamping the plate. To actually produce the plates described in our work, stamps would have to be manufactured for the different beading patterns. The soft beading edges in our samples ensure manufacturability. We will include a more detailed discussion in the final manuscript. \n\n\n2. **Real-World Data Simulations:** \nOur focus in this work is on establishing a data-driven benchmark dataset. Real-world experiments are beyond the scope of this work since special equipment for manufacturing and measurement would be needed. However, previous research provides good evidence for the validity of the Mindlin model and FEM in real world settings (see general answer). Generally, we are highly interested in real-world applicability and follow-up work should address this.\n\n3. **Mesh Geometries Representation:**\nThe mesh geometries are displayed (e.g. in Fig. 3) in their original discretized (an $81 \\times 121$ grid). We did not apply interpolation or other image improvements to have a faithful presentation. This will be explained in the figure caption.\n\n\n4. **Baseline Performances in Table 3:**\nWe agree that baselines are important and follow your suggestion of adding new baselines to the revised manuscript for a more comprehensive comparison of transfer learning performance.\n\n\n5. **Visualization in Figure 6:** \nWe appreciate your feedback on Figure 6 and suggestions for further visualizations. Regarding Figure 6, we want to make the point that despite visible errors in the field solution prediction, the frequency response (=average) is well estimated. \nWe agree that providing more visualizations of the model results is a good idea and will add them. For now, we provide several gifs showcasing the predicted and ground truth field solutions of the FQO-UNet. \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EUeeAtPm0ZFdC6oIBsxJQbsOhhfXVUk4?usp=sharing\n\n6. **Mechanical Model in Main Text:** \nWe agree on the importance of linking the mechanical model to our methodology and dataset construction. This will be changed in the revised manuscript.\n\n7. **Grid-Based Models and FNO:** \nBy grid-based models we refer to models, that can only make predictions for predefined, equidistant frequencies (i.e. a 1-dimensional grid). As you correctly point out, this holds for our implementation of the FNO method as well. The Grid-UNet and Grid-RN18 are ablation variations of the FQO-UNet and FQO-RN18, where we removed the frequency query mechanism.\nWe understand that the distinction between baseline methods and the ablation variations of our proposed method needs to be clarified. We will do so in our updated manuscript.\n\nPlease let us know, if there is still something left unclear!"

                        "value": "We thank you for your recognition of our paper's contributions. Your positive feedback on our paper\u2019s problem, finite element methodology, literature review, clarity, and discussion of limitations is greatly appreciated.\n\n**Response to suggestions, concerns and questions:**\n\n1. **Absence of Noise in Data:**\nOur work concerns learning models, that predict the frequency response of a vibrating plate. The primary goal is to learn a faithful surrogate model. All experiments evaluate scores on the test set, which consists of unseen plate geometries. Hence, they measure generalization and not just how well the data is fitted. Nonetheless, we agree that robustness to noise is important and particulary relevant for real world transfer (for example when manufacturing is imperfect) and should be addressed by follow-up work.\n\n2. **Details for Finite Element Method and Solver:** \nWe agree that the details of the finite element method and linear solver are crucial. We employ a specialized FEM implementation for acoustics [1]. The setup involves shell elements with 9 nodes, 6 degree of freedom and quadratic ansatz functions for discretization. The direct solver MUMPS [2] is employed. More comprehensive descriptions will be included in the final manuscript.\n\n3. **Aggregated Frequency Response Justification:** \nCalculating the aggregated frequency response by taking the mean squared velocity is a common choice in vibroacoustic simulation. The mean squared velocity is an important measure for the radiated sound power. Therefore, acoustic engineers use this quantity to evaluate structural design measures [3]. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n4. **Model Size and Hyperparameter Tuning:** \nWe agree on the relevance of model and training details. Model specifications are reported in Appendix C and ablation studies that document our hyperparameter tuning are listed in Appendix D. We will add the number of parameters for the different models to Appendix C. In our experiments, naively increasing the model size did not lead to better performance. \n\n5. **Question: Dataset Generation Settings:** \nThank you for highlighting this aspect. In our dataset, the zero displacement condition is applied exclusively at the plate's edges. This means the central part of the plate can move (vibrate) freely, while the edges are fixed. This modeling choice is common in structural analysis, especially in engineering applications where plates are often components of more complex assemblies. To prevent further misunderstandings, we clarify this in our manuscript.\n\n6. **Single-Point Vibration Assumption:**\nA point force excitation is one scenario among many (e.g. spatially distributed load or plane wave excitation). There are good reasons to choose a point force excitation: In real world applications, a point force can represent the force application point commonly defined by the bearing of a structure. Additionally, point actuators are used to excite the structure for experimental validation. Therefore, this setting is often employed in vibroacoustics, see e.g. [4] and [5]. We also choose an asymmetric excitation point to excite the important Eigenmodes. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n7. **Accuracy of FEM and Solver:**\nGenerally, the finite element approach in combination with linear direct solvers converges to the exact solution [6]. The accuracy of our solutions in relation to equation (1) is assured by a suitable discretization. In particular, we have chosen the mesh size such that the smallest occurring bending wavelength is discretized with at least 10 nodes. The smallest bending wavelength occurs at the highest frequency and can be analytically calculated for thin plate structures. This approach is common practice for choosing the mesh size of vibroacoustic models [7]. \n\n8. **Performance on Untrained Frequencies:**\nWe recognize the importance of our model's generalization capabilities, which we've explored for different amounts of beadings as detailed in our transfer learning section. Extending this to unseen frequency ranges is a great idea! We conducted this experiment and present our results in the general answer.\n\nWe would be interested to hear, whether our rebuttal addressed your concerns."

The dataset contains 12k plate geometries and their responses computed from the numerical method. The work has also proposed a list of evaluation metrics for a prediction model. It provides two models and tests them on the datasets."

We are grateful for your recognition of the interesting nature of the problem we address, the adequacy of our model choices, and the sufficiency of our experimental results.\n\n**Response to suggestions, concerns and questions:**\n\n\n1. **Concerns on Audience and Contribution:**\nWe would like to emphasize the position of our research in the established fields of *Machine learning for physics and science*. While machine learning applications to engineering are a fairly new topic in the machine learning community, there is great potential for impactful research. Applications of machine learning to other domains were highly successful, e.g. AlphaFold in biology [1]. Our work seeks to bridge the gap between the communities by challenging data-driven approaches with a mechanical engineering problem. While most existing research models the temporal evolution of dynamic systems, our work's novelty is to directly predict solutions in the frequency domain. To address this task, we contribute a benchmark dataset, scores of relevant baselines, and the new FQO-UNet model.\n\n\n2. **Question on Baselines vs. Proposed Method:**\nAs baselines, we selected methods that were proposed in the literature for related physics-based problems. In contrast, our proposed FQO-UNet is specifically designed to address the unique challenges of vibroacoustic frequency response prediction. \nFor instance, the prediction of resonance peaks is addressed by the frequency-query approach. However, we agree that the distinction between baseline methods and the ablation variations of our proposed method needs to be emphasized and we will do so in our updated manuscript.\n\nWe would be grateful if you report whether our answer addressed your concerns or if additional questions have come up.\n\n---------------------\n[1] Jumper et al.: \"Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold\", Nature (2021)"
