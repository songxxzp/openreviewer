Is the dataset reproducible?\n\n> This work introduces Solis-seg, a Deep Neural Network optimized\n\nThe abstract implies Solis-seg is a new architecture, but the details are never given. I'm not sure if Section 3.3 is implying that it is a variant of the original AutoDeepLab model? I'll assume it is, but this needs to be stated if you are saying you are introducing something.\n\n\n> Our research utilized a PyTorch adaptation of the original AutoDeepLab model, optimized and modified for our dataset.\n\nDetails about what the important modifications were would be helpful.\n\n\n> \"after accounting for multiple polygons\"\n\nHow were there multiple polygons on the same site? The details of polygon\ngeneration is unclear? Binary or another form of thresholding from a heatmap? \n\n\n> equate to approximately 583 potential solar farms\n\nPotential? Is there a process for validating the proposals? It would be helpful to report how many of these were validated as actual correct decisions. I.e. in a random sample, have a group classify them as false positives, true positives, and indeterminate cases and report the numbers. \n\n\n> ChatGPT generated model \n\nThe details of how this worked or what type of model it produced is unclear.\nDid it just produce pytorch code?\n\n\nHave you seen \"An Analysis of Pre-Training on Object Detection\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05871.pdf) which concludes that its hard to tune a detection network from a classification network, but easy to go the other way? This seems similar to your experience of having trouble with classification and segmentation.\n\n\nThe total time to train models was given, but how many batch iterations / second was each model able to perform at? This number can help compare model efficiency directly and abstracts away \"unfortunate random seeds\" that might cause one model to take longer to train than another.\n\n\nAll scores in Table 4 are reasonably high. Is there a chance they are overtuned to the validation data?\n\nAt the very end you mention you use all spectral bands? Did you evaluate using RGB only? or RGB+NIR? In my experience the coastal, swir, and other bands do not perform as well as RGB or RGBN on sentinel 2 tasks. I'm not sure why this is, but it's an effect I've noticed.\n\n\nDid you measure the power consumption and emissions from your work? If not, I\nrecommend codecarbon."

                    "value": "**W1**: the submitted paper does only provide little to no methodological contribution or methodological novelty. All methods presented in the paper are known and applied to the given dataset. Specifically, for the NAS based architecture benchmark, it seems that only a few selected architectures are evaluated or benchmarked. \n\n**W2**: Important details to understand the method and experimental setup are missing:\n- (i) no details are given for the architectures to be evaluated. What are the results of NAS? Are these architectures based on U-Net or are they FCN?\n- (ii) no information is given about the classification task, which was used for the proposed transfer learning experiment. Just at the end of the paper, there is a sentence about a ResNet being used (page 7). How was the transfer learning experiment setup? Did the authors take the pretrained ResNet model parameter as the encoder for the U-Net and randomly initialized the decoder?\n- (iii) what was the prompt used to retrieve the ChatGPT architecture?\n- (iv) what is the \"solis-dataset\" used for training and evaluation (Sec. 3.4.2)? Is this the author's own dataset of 200k Sentinel-2 level-2A images? Where is the solar farm segmentation ground truth coming from? Is it coming from one of the related works? If yes, why not take the entire dataset from the related work for evaluation? \n\nSuch details are important and do provide valuable information about the approach helping to understand the author's contribution. I would welcome to see such details in the appendix of the paper.\n\n**W3**: the authors call the ChatGPT model a \"random model\". This is confusing. What do the authors mean by calling the model random? Do they mean the architecture or the model parameter being random.  I am asking because the experiments in the paper do also focus on the evaluation of pre-trained models+transfer learning and models trained from scratch. In case the architecture is meant to be \"random\", I would not agree to call this \"random\". ChatGPT retrieved the architecture from somewhere. It would be interesting if the provided architecture from ChatGPT is a known (or a modification of a) segmentation architecture such as U-Net or is something totally different? The authors might even try to ask ChatGPT to provide the sources of the architecture. Since all such details are missing, I am only speculating what this \"random model\" is about. \n\n**W4**: structure of the paper could improve. The experimental setup is fragmented in multiple sections so that it is difficult to follow. It can be found in \"Sec. 3.1 Criteria and Metrics\" and \"Sec. 3.2 Training Environment and Data\" while \"Sec 3.1\" is mixing up computational resources with dataset.\n\n\n**W5**: image captions do not really convey what the figure is about. I would suggest providing more details in the image caption. Additionally, some figures do not provide enough details to be understood since labels for the x or y-axis are missing. \n\n**W6**: It is not clear what Table 2 is about (what is search, what is retrain?) and is not referenced in the text body of the paper. Since it probably conveys results of one of the two experiments of the submission it might be important to put the table in context of the main body of the paper."

The paper presents the motivation (detection of solar farms) and immediately discusses the challenges of NAS. Is NAS the ONLY approach to detect solar farm? If the author wants to use NAS for solar farm detection, it should be clearly specified beforehand. Also, other approaches for solar farm detection should also be presented and compared with NAS. Also, wouldn't it be better to summarize the major contribution of the work before discussing the related work. \n\n2) This work appears as an implementation of an existing method (AutoDeepLab) for solan farm identification. However, it is very difficult to confirm this because the paper does NOT have a method section. The section 3, which ought to be presenting the methods,  starts with metrics and training strategies!\n\nDue to a lack of clarity in the novelty offered by this work, along with a very poor presentation, I am inclined to reject this work."

The study consists of two types of experiments. The first experiment examines both transfer learning and non-transfer learning-based semantic segmentation, while the second experiment investigates the impact of dataset size on the performance of the NAS. The authors achieved an impressive 96.26% (mIoU) on the European dataset."
