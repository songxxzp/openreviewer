Through an analysis in terms optimization the authors claim that the current approaches emphasize the minimzation of the smoothing term leaving aside the term related to classification accuracy. The authors propose to fix this with a novel update of the nodes embeddings and a further approach based on the complement of a graph.\n\nThe authors report experiments showing the effectivity of the proposed approach."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "It is unclear how the analysis of embeddings is done. The authors present an analysis where the update of the kth layer is posed as an optimization problem, where the resulting update is in terms of the previous embedding. I wonder why this is the case. I assume that the optimization problem of the current task is on the output provided by the last layer, for which the embedding is provided by the architecture considered by the authors. Instead, the authors propose to analyze the current problem as some sort of nested optimization problems, where each of the embeddings, i.e. $k$, is computed through an optimization problem which is in terms of the previous embedding, i.e. $k-1$. Why is this approach through nested optimization problems suitable? Is it somehow standard in the literature or is it as well a contribution from the authors?\n\nThe authors consider the complement of a graph as a way to obtain information that allows the model to pull nodes apart. There are a couple of concerns about this approach:\n\n1. if the original input graph is sparse, then the complement of a graph is dense, which implies a quadratic number of edges in terms of the number of nodes. Given this, to what degree is the proposed approach scalable? In several places the authors briefly mention some sort of sampling, but it is unclear if this is well explored or explained in the paper.\n\n2. the notion of a complement of a graph in the context of this paper is related to negative edges, i.e. edges that encode conflict, enmity or polarity, and hence they are useful to pull nodes apart in the embedding. This kind of edges have been explored previously in the literature in the context of spectral clustering and graph-based semi-supervised learning. Examples of previous works are:\n\n    a. Node classification for signed networks using diffuse interface methods, 2019\n\n    b. A Linearly Constrained Power Iteration for Spectral Semi-Supervised Classification on Signed Graphs, 2022\n\n    c. Dissimilarity in graph-based semisupervised classification, 2007\n\n    d. Node classification in signed social networks, 2016"

Can the authors provide an insight, motivation or design choice for analyzing the current approach as a set of nested optimization problems rather than directly studying the original optimization problem, which is based on the embedding of the last layer?\n2. Can the authors elaborate on how the proposed approach handles the large amount of edges that are potentially observed in the complement of a graph?"

To address this, the authors propose three graph convolution methods: a supervised approach called OGC that leverages label information, and two \"no-learning\" unsupervised methods, GGC and its multi-scale version GGCM, designed to preserve graph structure information during convolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these proposed methods."

However, I find the motivation for doing so somewhat unclear. The authors repeatedly assert that the GCN solution solely optimizes the L_smooth, which is indeed true when considering the equivalent of message passing. However, in actual training, GCN still utilizes a supervised loss to train the network, and label errors propagate through all layers. Therefore, the advantages of integrating label information into the proposed framework require further explanation and analysis to clarify their significance."

I don't think there is any new discovery out from existing literature. This also means that the author didn't have done a comprehensive literature review in this topic. Since I have not pay attention to this area for years, I can name one that is highly related: ICML workshop 2020, \"Connecting Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph-Regularized PCA\". There were also some works like unrolling the optimization process to build a graph convolution operator, which are also highly related to methods designed in this paper. \n\n2. The topic is kind of out-of-date for ICLR conference. This topic is widely studied before and I personally don't find it is interesting or meaningful to revisit this topic. \n\n3. The experimental part is also week. Revisiting with existing old benchmark datasets is not valuable. The author at least should consider modern benchmarks like OGB."

The authors' analyses are restricted to simpler models alone. \n- While the results on small-scale datasets are promising, they need support from larger datasets like the OGB benchmark. The experiments need to compare all methods that use label information.
