That is, the learning rate for each communication round decays up until the next communication. The paper shows convergence for strongly convex, Lipschitz local objectives with bounded gradients and bounded gradient variance. The empirical evaluation shows that this learning rate scheduling achieves results en-par with other state-of-the-art federated learning approaches (FedBN, FedEM, and pFedME) both for standard FL settings and personalized FL settings."

The connection between heterogeneous data (often interpreted as data being drawn non-iid from a global distribution) and personalized federated learning (often defined as collaborative learning of local models with local data drawn from different, but related distributions) is not made clear. \n- The paper lacks discussion of many relevant papers on heterogeneous federated learning [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8].\n- The theoretical analysis is very close to [9], which already discusses the necessity of decaying learning rates. In particular, this paper does not explicitly state that a globally decaying learning rate is required, but smuggles this assumption in through the definition of $\\alpha_j$. So ultimately, the learning rate is not cyclic decaying, but the product of a cyclic decaying learning rate and a linearly decaying learning rate. It is not surprising that the multiplication with some cyclic decaying learning rate does not change the order of convergence. Thus, I do not see the contribution, here.\n- The empirical evaluation does not convincingly show an advantage of the proposed method. The method performs en par with other methods in terms of accuracy, communication and computation.\n- The paper does not evaluate different degrees of heterogeneity of local datasets, or using different local data distributions (as common in PFL).\n\n\n\n[1] Li, Tian, et al. \"Federated optimization in heterogeneous networks.\" Proceedings of Machine learning and systems 2 (2020): 429-450.\n[2] Karimireddy, Sai Praneeth, et al. \"Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning.\" International conference on machine learning.

How is this work placed w.r.t. such studies?\n- My main concern regards the novelty introduced by this work. As mentioned above, previous works discuss learning rate decay in local federated training. Specifically, [4] shows the necessity to leverage learning rate decay to reach fast convergence in $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{N})$ and consequent better generalization. How does FedDecay differ from these findings?\n- Missing convergence proof under non-convex settings.\n- In my opinion, the experimental settings are not complete. For instance, different client participation (partial vs full participation) is not analyzed, as well as the impact of different degrees of data heterogeneity. In addition, $\\alpha=0.4$ for SST2 does not create a strongly heterogeneous setting and this choice is not discussed. \n- The performance gains introduced in Table 1 and 2 are minimal.\n- The parameter $\\alpha$ of FedDecay is kept constant and not further analyzed. While it is reasonable to keep it fixed when comparing with other algorithms, it would be interesting to understand its impact and eventual connection with $\\beta$. \n\n\n**References** \n[1] Cho, Yae Jee, Jianyu Wang, and Gauri Joshi. \"Client selection in federated learning: Convergence analysis and power-of-choice selection strategies.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.01243 (2020). \n[2] Yu, Hao, Sen Yang, and Shenghuo Zhu. \"Parallel restarted SGD with faster convergence and less communication: Demystifying why model averaging works for deep learning.\" AAAI.

How does FedDecay compare with methods proper of the literature of heterogeneous FL, e.g. SCAFFOLD, FedDyn, FedSAM?\n3. Communication is the main bottleneck in FL. How does FedDecay compare with the other methods in terms of convergence speed?\n4. Does the gradient decay introduced by FedDecay help reduce the client drift? Is the local overfitting reduced?"
