Previously (page 5) $v_A$, $v_B$, and $v_R$ were stated to be vector representations of the values (as opposed to the binary represntations) of $A$ and $B$. But in 4.6, $v_A$ has become the concatenation of the vectors of $a_0, a_1$, etc., which are the bits of $A$? This seems more like symbolic manipulation to me.\n\nThe ablation study in section 5 shows that the position embedding is necessary, but this has to be so, because otherwise the encoder would know nothing about the order of the digits."

Please also have a look at the global responses where we summarize our general comments. \n\nQ1: Section 4.6 (now moved to Appendix for lack of space) provides more details on the concept introduces in 4.3 considering the autoregressive nature of the LM. In this case v_A and v_B are the composition of value vectors (each deriving from a single token = bit) but not the composition of original bits. So the computation still take place in the embedding space in vectorial form (without explicit bit manipulation). Some further comments have been added to the new version of this section.\n\nConcerning the internal implementation of multiplication, we believe that a good parallel is considering an MLP with two (numerical) inputs for the operands, one output neuron for the result and some intermediate levels. You can train such simple model to learn multiplication as a regression problem; in case of Relu activation function, it is likely that the solution is a piecewise linear approximation of the non-linear surface."

                    "value": "This paper investigates language models' ability to perform arithmetic computations.\nIt focuses on language models trained on a single arithmetic operation\u2014either addition or multiplication\u2014which operates on binary natural numbers between 0 and 127.\nThese numbers are zero padded in their most significant digits (so they always have the same length when input to the models), and are reversed (going from least significant to most significant digit).\nThe paper proposes a Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis, arguing models encode input digits, perform a regression task in its hidden states space, and then decode the output digits.\nThe paper then runs a number of experiments:\n* **Performance in distribution.** In the first experiment, the models are simply trained and evaluated on i.i.d train-validation split. The models reach ~100% accuracy in both train and validation.\n* **Memorisation baseline.** In the second experiment, models are trained on a dataset for which outputs are randomly sampled. In this setting, the model takes much longer to reach a reasonable training performance, and never passes chance validation performance.\n* **Performance out of distribution.** In the third experiment, models are trained on two train--validation splits designed to evaluate o.o.d. performance. Two splitting strategies are proposed: (i) one creates o.o.d. splits based on the hamming distance between the strings (e.g., 01101000) representing the input digits, and (ii) the second creates o.o.d. splits by putting all inputs representing numbers from 32 to 64 in a validation set. In these experiments, the authors find that models have a harder time generalising in the second setting, and take this as evidence of the Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis.\n* **Embedding Distance and Correlations.** The authors also: (i) get the hidden state of their model when input the same value twice (e.g., when input $A+A$), (ii) compute the distance between each pair of hidden states representing $A+A$ with $A \\in [0, 127]$, (iii) compute the (Hamming and value) distance between each pair of  inputs $A \\in [0, 127]$, (iv) evaluate the correlation between hidden state and input distances. In this task, the authors find that hidden state distances correlate more strongly with Hamming distances in early and final layers, but with numerical distances in middle layer. This is taken as evidence for the Encoding-Regression-Decoding hypothesis.\n* **Performance with reverse vs normal strings.** The authors compare model performance when predicting reversed or normal digits. They show learning arithmetic tasks with reversed digit strings is easier, which they take as evidence that language models compute outputs iteratively one bit at a time."

E.g., manipulating datasets on which a model is trained/evaluated to analyse its computational strategy (e.g., Linzen et al. 2016, Warstadt et al. 2020). E.g.2, computing distances in embedding space which are representative of other notions of distances (e.g., Hewitt and Manning. 2019, White et al. 2021,  Limisiewicz and Mare\u010dek. 2021)\n* Many issues have been pointed out with this type of non-causal probing analyses (e.g., Elazar et al. 2021, Ravfogel et al. 2021, Lasri et al. 2022) which would be interesting to acknowledge.\n* It cites no related mechanistic interpretation work either. Hanna et al. (2023), in particular, study how GPT models implement a greater than operation, which is quite related to the research question investigated here.\n\nRelated to the issue above, the set of experiments already in this paper are a nice start on the quest to understand how arithmetic operations are implemented in language models. But this paper\u2019s contributions could be much stronger if the authors engaged with the literature above and applied some of the more recent probing/interpretability techniques in their analyses. As is, I do not think this paper\u2019s contributions are strong enough to warrant publication in ICLR.\n\n\n## References\n\n* Naik et al. 2019. Exploring Numeracy in Word Embeddings.

This could likely be made clearer to the reader.\n\nPlots are not currently readable in black and white.\n\nCitation Wei et al. (Chain of thought) is currently duplicated."

That would likely require a deeper discussion of prior work, and adopting some of those techniques to this work (or motivating why new techniques are required).\nAs mentioned in my review, I still believe what this paper does is a combination of: \n* Behavioural probing: manipulating datasets on which a model is trained/evaluated to analyse its computational strategy (e.g., Linzen et al. 2016, Warstadt et al. 2020). \n* Traditional probing: computing distances in embedding space which are representative of other notions of distances (e.g., Hewitt and Manning. 2019, White et al. 2021, Limisiewicz and Mare\u010dek. 2021).\n\nIt's not because the authors use no probe here, that their embedding distance correlational analysis is less susceptible (than, e.g., Hewitt and Manning's approach) to the criticism put forward by causal probing papers. (Or maybe there is some reason why the criticism does not apply to this work, but I did not find that argument in the paper.)\nI would recommend the authors try to apply some causal probing techniques here, such as, e.g., Geiger et al. (2021, 2023).\n\nRelated to the new sentence \"Mechanistic interpretability is still more ambitious, since it is aimed at reverse engineering the algorithm that a model uses to solve a task\". I don't think this is true. As far as I know, there is no difference between the goals of \"causal probing\" and \"mechanistic interpretability\". I think these are just two names for the same thing (which were developed in parallel by different sub-communities doing interpretability of neural models).\n\n* Geiger et al. 2021.

Specifically, the abstract and introduction lack clarity regarding the nature of the investigation. It's not immediately apparent what the central findings are, the experiments conducted to arrive at these conclusions, and how this differs from existing knowledge in the field.\n\n* There is a noticeable absence of some relevant literature. The authors should consider reviewing \"A Mechanistic Interpretation of Arithmetic Reasoning in Language Models using Causal Mediation Analysis (Stolfo et al. 2023),\" as well as other works cited in that paper, which seem pertinent to this study.\n\n* Prior research indicates that certain types of positional encoding, such as Sinusoidal Positional Embedding\u2014a fixed form of positional encoding\u2014struggle with extrapolation to unseen positions. The use of this method in the toy models might result in outcomes more attributable to positional embedding issues rather than the arithmetic aspects under investigation."
