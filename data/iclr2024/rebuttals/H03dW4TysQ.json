The proposed MoEDM enhances the inference efficiency for the desinated tasks, mantaining intact the task-specific performance metrics. The parameter sparse strategy effectively navigates the trade-off between efficiency and capability, establishing it as a feasible optimization technique for diffusion models. The experimental results show the good performances of the proposed MoEDM model."

As for the diffusion models, MoE structure is not firstly introduced for the text2image diffusion models, e.g. [RAPHAEL: Text-to-Image Generation via\nLarge Mixture of Diffusion Paths].  The sparse parameter pruning with MoE is also widely used for the large dense model\uff0ce.g. [Task-Specific Expert Pruning for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts]. Although this paper introduces a sparse MoE structure to prune the large scale of parameters of dense diffusion models, the novelty of the proposed methods is limited.\n\n2. Experiments are probably not sufficient. It is not easy to evaluate the performance of the image generation method. The evaluation metrics, KID and FID  are actually insensitive to the generated image  quality and these metrics cannot evaluate the image  quality well."

Q1: Equal to W1, The novelty we wish to emphasize that while pursuing general, large-scale models, it's imperative to consider the specific needs of users. The long-term use of models for specialized purposes is a common occurrence, yet it is often overlooked by the community. Employing methods like layer removal and MoE are merely tools for achieving this objective.\n4. Q2: In Section 3.2 of our paper, we have clearly stated: \"Fortunately, in diffusion models, the time step t is always known, allowing for targeted activation based on t. This makes the gated mechanism of MoEDM a training-free approach.\" This implies that we can directly select experts with smaller id based on a smaller value of t. And it is crucial to emphasize that the speed improvement of MoEDM is not related to the number of experts. This is because the number of experts does not affect the volume of parameters involved in the computation at each step of the diffusion sampling process.\n5. Q3: We have provided numerous visualizations of generated images, along with comparisons to baseline models, in the appendix of our paper. We will place greater emphasis on this aspect in the updated version of our paper."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for the thoughtful and detailed review. We reply point-by-point here, to begin the discussion.\n1. W1: \n  - As mentioned in Equation 1, after zeroing out a specific channel, we conduct a diffusion sampling and measure the difference between the generated image and the standard image. This process is indeed time-consuming, but we have observed a consistent pattern across different categories and models: the layers at both ends are absolutely crucial, while the importance of the middle layers is much lower. Consequently, in our MoEDM approach, we adopt the strategy of directly removing the middle layers, eliminating the need for further assessment of parameter importance.\n  -  In Section 3.2 of our paper, we have clearly stated: \"Fortunately, in diffusion models, the time step t is always known, allowing for targeted activation based on t. This makes the gated mechanism of MoEDM a training-free approach.\" This implies that we can directly select experts with smaller id based on a smaller value of t.\n  - As mentioned above, our specific pruning algorithm involves removing the layers located in the middle of the model.\n2. It is important to emphasize that our study focuses not on improving the model's performance, but on enhancing efficiency while maintaining existing performance levels. As shown in Table 3 of our paper, we have significantly increased the model's operating speed while maintaining the performance of high-resolution models on specific tasks.\n3. Thank you for pointing out the need for more ablation studies. We will supplement our studies with these additional ablation experiments. However, it is crucial to emphasize that the speed improvement of MoEDM is not related to the number of experts. This is because the number of experts does not affect the volume of parameters involved in the computation at each step of the diffusion sampling process.\n4.  Thank you for pointing out the need for experiments on DiT, and we will supplement our studies with these additional experiments on DiT.\n5. We emphasize that this paper (Structural Pruning for Diffusion Models) was made public after the submission deadline for ICLR 2024, and we will include this work as a baseline in our supplementary materials.\n6. Regarding randomness, we did not deliberately control it in our study. Random seeds can be randomly selected during the sampling process."

The paper also does not provide a comprehensive explanation of why these methods are \u201cfall short in preserving the performance\u2026\u201d.

The same issue still applies to the remaining sections.\n2.As mentioned in the paper, the term 'minimal computational cost' is used, but it lacks a clear definition, making it a concept that may lead to confusion.\n3.In Section 3.1, the paper mentions that the convolutional layers 'constitute approximately 80% of the model\u2019s parameters.' However, the paper does not provide the calculation method used to obtain this value.\n4.Why setting diffusion models to zero is work ? \n5.It\u2019s better to provide experiments comparing with model acceletion methods (DPM-Solver, DPM-Solver++, DDIM, ToMe) to prove that MoEDM enhances the inference efficiency.\nDDIM: Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models;\nToMe: Token merging for fast stable diffusion; \nDPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps; \nDPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models;\nThe experimental validation is not convincing:\n1.The paper only provides 64x64 and 256x256 resolution outputs, while diffuison-based models can generate high-resolution results of 512x512 (e.g., Stable DIffusion).\n2.In this paper, the proposed method aims to reduce computational costs, but its effectiveness may not be fully convincing. Training experiments require 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and even for sampling, a single NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory is needed.\n3.It would be more valuable to see if this method can be built with more diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion and DeepFloyd-IF.\nIt would be better to compare the proposed method with current personalization methods based on diffusion models, such as CustomDiffusion and DreamBooth.\nCustomDiffusion: Multi-Concept Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion; DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation;"

Poor Presentation\n  - \"All-encompassing arsenal\" means that the model is capable of accommodating a wide variety of user requirements.\n  - As we mentioned at the beginning of the Introduction, large-scale, general-purpose diffusion models contain 3.5 billion or even more parameters. Such a vast number of parameters inevitably leads to inefficiency, a consensus in the academic community. Additionally, many users are likely to only require specific functionalities of diffusion models for extended periods. For example, a pet store may only attempt to create images of pets, thus deploying an ultra-large-scale model would be wasteful.\n  - In Figure 2 of our paper, we explicitly demonstrate the results of using traditional compression algorithms. Due to the inability to identify crucial parameters, these methods make it more challenging to restore model performance.\n2. The term \"minimal computational cost\" refers to our aim to significantly reduce the runtime of diffusion models by decreasing the number of parameters, particularly for user-specific tasks. We will also provide detailed and clear explanations in the updated version of our paper.\n3. We can determine the proportion of parameters in convolutional layers within diffusion models by directly traversing the checkpoints of these models.\n4. This is because, in our study, the task of image synthesis is specific, rather than for a general purpose.  Simultaneously, due to the integration of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) algorithm, our approach can achieve performance equivalent to that of the original model.\n5. We wish to emphasize that our study is not aimed at comparing the capabilities of acceleration algorithms for diffusion models. Instead, it highlights how our proposed method, MoEDM, can seamlessly integrate with existing acceleration techniques.\n\nExperiment 1. Thank you for pointing out the need for experiments targeting higher resolutions. We will supplement our studies with these additional experiments.\n\nExperiment 2. In Figure 6 of the appendix, we provide details on the memory usage of MoEDM, which does not exceed 10,000M and is slightly lower than that of a full-size model. We emphasize that although our experiments were conducted using an A100 GPU, our method remains effective when sampling with other GPUs.\n\nExperiment 3. Thank you for pointing out the need for experiments on other personalized diffusion models. We will supplement our studies with these additional experiments."

Duplicating the remaining layers and then activating these copies selectively, based on the specific timestep in the diffusion process.\n3. Employing knowledge distillation from alternative diffusion models, which lessens the dependency on high-quality data.\n\nWhen these strategies are applied together, the refined model exhibits a modest boost in both speed and precision compared to the original baseline, especially after being fine-tuned on a narrow and specific dataset"

                    "value": "W1: While the paper contributes to ongoing discussions in the field, the technical novelty could be further strengthened. The concept of layer removal has precedents, such as in the design of SDXL [1]. Additionally, the current application of Mixture of Experts (MOE) seems to follow familiar patterns, similar to those seen in EDiff-I [2], which might benefit from a more rigorous comparative analysis. The use of distillation to enhance data efficiency is an interesting approach, though its integration with the other proposed methods (aiming for efficiency improvements) appears tangential and warrants a clearer rationale.\n\nW2: The experimental validation presented could be more robust. The majority of efficiency gains appear attributable to the removal of intermediate layers, raising questions about the relative contribution of other proposed innovations. The focus on a singular class from ImageNet may not sufficiently demonstrate the model's generalizability. For the text-to-image results, the paper only present a few curated images, and it would benefit from a broader set of comparisons to fully ascertain the model's effectiveness.\n\nW3: The clarity and structure of the paper would greatly benefit from revision. For instance, the processes following the removal of intermediate layers, including whether the model undergoes fine-tuning with the original dataset, are not clearly outlined. A more detailed discussion in the technical sections, perhaps with an expanded explanation of the loss functions used, would enhance the reader's understanding. \n\nIn conclusion, the core ideas of the paper are interesting, yet the manuscript would benefit from substantial revisions to meet the acceptance bar. I would encourage the authors to consider this feedback constructively, make the necessary improvements, and consider resubmission to an alternative venue for a future iteration of their work.\n\n[1] Podell, Dustin, et al. \"Sdxl: Improving latent diffusion models for high-resolution image synthesis.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.01952 (2023).\n\n[2] Balaji, Yogesh, et al. \"ediffi: Text-to-image diffusion models with an ensemble of expert denoisers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01324 (2022)."

W1: We wish to emphasize that while pursuing general, large-scale models, it's imperative to consider the specific needs of users. The long-term use of models for specialized purposes is a common occurrence, yet it is often overlooked by the community. Employing methods like layer removal and MoE are merely tools for achieving this objective.\n2.  W2: Indeed, the removal of intermediate layers significantly enhances efficiency, but the resultant performance loss is not negligible. To address this, we introduce the MoE mechanism to compensate for these performance deficits, as emphasized in our ablation experiments. Furthermore, we will conduct additional experiments on various datasets and present the results in the updated version of our paper.\n3. W3: Thank you for pointing out the clarity and structure of our paper. In fact, in our ablation experiments, we have demonstrated the results of fine-tuning the original model. We will train the MoEDM using the same loss function. We will enhance the clarity of our paper's presentation in the updated version."
