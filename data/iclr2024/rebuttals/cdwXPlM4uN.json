The only contribution is the loss function used here is different from previous work. This contribution is not sufficient for conferences like ICLR. \n\n- It is hard to determine that the usage of this loss function is unique in the literature. In the domain of knowledge distillation in ANNs, there are numerous works studying different types of loss functions. Whether this loss function is original remains questioned. \n\n- I find the design choice of simply averaging the time dimension in SNN featuremaps inappropriate. The method in this paper is not the real way to compute the similarity matrix. Instead, to calculate the real similarity matrix of SNNs, the authors should flatten the SNN activation to $[B, TCHW]$ and then compute the $B\\times B$ covariance matrix. For detailed explanation, check [1]. \n\n- Apart from accuracy, there are not many insightful discoveries for readers to understand the specific mechanism of this loss function. \n\n- The experiments are not validated on ImageNet, which largely weakens the empirical contribution of this paper.  \n\nminor concerns:\n\n- \" The second is that the neuron state of ANNs is represented in binary format but that of SNNs is represented in float format, leading to the precision mismatch between ANNs and SNNs\", wrong value formats of SNNs and ANNs. \n\n- The related work should be placed in the main text, rather than the appendix. There are many spaces left on the 9th page.  \n\n[1]  Uncovering the Representation of Spiking Neural Networks Trained with Surrogate Gradient"

                    "value": "The main issue in this paper is the premise of using ANNs as teachers, and the lack of motivation thereof. As the authors describe in their introduction, one of the main benefits of SNNs is their improved energy cost. However, if the method requires an ANN to be trained anyways, why would one even still have to train the SNN at all? Is the argument here purely about the cost of inference? While this might be valid in some (few) scenarios, in most cases the training cost by far outweighs the cost of inference. I believe that these points are problematic by themselves, but they are not even mentioned in the paper as limitations.\n\nIn addition, given that the paper allows using an entirely new source of information, the performance gains over previous methods are rather marginal. For example, on CIFAR10, their method seems to improve by about 1% over baseline methods, while requiring a full ANN to be trained.\n\nFurthermore, the presentation of the paper could be improved. I believe that the paper could benefit from a more extensive section on background. Many important details are currently in the appendix, for example, what is relation-based knowledge? How does it differ from feature-based knowledge? These terms are even used in the overview figure 1, but are never described in the main paper.\n\nLastly, the authors propose to use average pooling to align the dimensions of the ANN and the SNN. This clearly leads to a loss of information of the SNN (many SNN activations can have the same average), but it is never explored nor discussed how this impacts performance."

                    "value": "This paper introduces a method for training SNNs called SuperSNN, by using an ANN as a teacher within a Teacher-Student learning framework. In order to address the challenges of the additional temporal dimension and the binary representation of unit activity in SNNs, this work incorporates pairwise-relational knowledge distillation from ANNs into the loss function, alongside the entropy loss from the task. This study demonstrates that SuperSNN improves SNN performance, outperforming existing SNN training methods, and enabling the transfer of knowledge from both homogeneous and heterogeneous ANNs to SNNs."

                    "value": "- This paper presents an effective method for training SNNs, which leads to improved SNN performance.\n- This paper demonstrates knowledge transfer that is not limited to ANNs and SNNs that share the same network architecture; it is also effective when the ANN and SNN have different network architectures."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- The figure legends, particularly for Figure 4 and Figure 5, are difficult to read and could be improved for clarity.\n- I feel that this paper lacks a clear summary of existing efforts on knowledge distillation in SNNs, making the motivation and contributions of this work less clear. One suggestion I have is to move the related work section from the appendix to the main text. This would provide readers that have less background knowledge on this subject with a better understanding of how the current work connects and differs with the existing literature.\n- This work shows a limited exploration of the temporal dimension in SNNs and focuses on processing static images, which overlooks the advantage of SNNs in processing temporal data.\n- I would also appreciate a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach."

Can the proposed approach be extended to other neuron types, such as the Izhikevich neurons?\n- It's not very clear to me what \"time step\" refers to in this study. What's the significance of achieving good performance with fewer time steps?"
