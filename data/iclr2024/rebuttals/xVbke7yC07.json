The presentation is far subpar compared to the standards of this conference. Just name a few places of awkwardness: Table 2 *listed the raw data points of actual and predicted values and took a whole page* --- the authors could have used a figure and/or summary metrics instead of listing the raw data points. Figure 3 is not very informative since it\u2019s plainly presenting the metrics during training without much insights. Figure 4 can be removed since the information exists in Figure 5. Transparency in Figure 5 shall be adjusted for clarity.\n3.\tNow let\u2019s discuss the content. The authors only presented a single run of the experiment, without repetition, and *without any baseline for comparison*. Even if the authors are the first to use a pre-existing method on a new task/dataset (which I am not sure if this is the case for this study), they are still expected to present a handful of alternatives and provide insight on why what they recommend works better than others. Additionally, if this is a task where a simple plug-and-play --- without targeted innovation --- works effortlessly, there is little value in writing a paper on it.\n4.\tIn all, I would strongly recommend the authors read at least 10 papers published at ICLR in the recent years to better understand the standards for presentation and content."

In particular, each node in the graph corresponds to the VMAX value at a specific geographical location, while the edges represent the temporal development of cyclones over a 6-hour time frame. Authors provided a dataset and a code for review."
