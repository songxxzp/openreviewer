After all, the graph size is limited and finite anyway.\n* Similarly, the \"stability through Lipstichz smoothness\" \"principle\" for designing all GNNs is too strong and may not be necessary in general. The choice of GNNs depends more on the specific data distribution to approximate. \n* The resulting APGNN model is similar to the previous DAGNN except for the concrete parameterizations of $\\theta^k$.\n\nThe evaluation procedure is also concerned with potentially unfair comparison. \n* There seems to be no cross-validation procedure to tune hyper-parameters even though many of the datasets are small (at most 1000 test nodes). \n* The efforts for tuning hyper-parameters seem non-equal between proposed methods and baselines."

For example, use 10-fold cross-validation to tune hyper-parameters, and then only apply the selected hyper-parameter once to report the performances. Assigning equal hyper-parameter tuning efforts to all baselines and proposed methods is desirable for a fairer comparison. It is okay for the performances to be lower than other reported ones, as long as they are reliable, reproducible, and comparable. It would also be better to include other larger datasets for evaluation even though the proposed methods' performances may not be better than baselines on them, as long as there are reasonable explanations."

APGNN uses exponentially decaying weights to aggregate information of different orders and a P-hop filter to perceive deeper neighbor information. This allows seamless extension to infinite depths. Finally, this paper empirically shows that APGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks across both homophilic and heterophilic graphs."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The novelty of the proposed polynomial graph filter is a bit limited. The incorporation of the \u03b1^k term is similar to the decay rate used in PPNP, and the inclusion of a learnable parameter \u03b2 (although not explicitly described in the paper) can draw strong similarities with GPR-GNN and many other polynomial filter methods such as ChebNet, ChebNetII, and BerNet. The primary novelty stems from the design of the P-hop filter, which essentially uses the power of the adjacent matrix as the new adjacent matrix to capture longer distance relations with significantly higher computation and memory costs. The paper refers to its proposed method as the \"adaptive power GNN\", but many existing works have already achieved the same goal. \n\n2. The motivation behind the proposed method is somewhat unclear. The design of the exponential decreasing coefficients lacks a clearer explanation and motivation. While some strength such as convergence and stability is claimed, there is no clear evidence why the proposed one can be better than existing ones such as GPR-GNN which also has convergence and stability based on the description in Section 4.2. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide a more in-depth explanation of the intuition behind the design to enhance understanding.\n\n3. The experiment does not provide sufficient ablation study to investigate why the proposed method can improve the performance over existing polynomial methods. Additional explanations and in-depth analysis of the experiments are anticipated. \n\n4. The experimental comparisons with the baselines are unfair. Specifically, it is mentioned in section 6.1 that it fixes the polynomial order K=10 for baselines such as ChebNet, APPNP, GNN-LF, GNN-HF, DAGNN, APPNP, GPR-GNN, and BernNet. However, the proposed method selects K in the range {1,2,..., 20} and the total number of propagation layers is T=KP where P is selected from the range {1,2,3,4,5}. In other words, the proposed method uses significantly more layers than the baselines. This raises concerns about the improvement over baselines.\n\n5. The paper claims that different from existing GNNs, APGNN can be seamlessly extended to an infinite-depth network. However, the method still chooses a finite-depth implementation, and there is no evidence on how to extend it to an infinite-depth network."
