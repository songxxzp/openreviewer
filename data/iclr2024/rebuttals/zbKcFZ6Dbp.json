Although the light-source-shadow-based explanation is quite helpful in understanding WHAT the proposed methods are doing, but does not explain at all WHY they do so. Specifically, we do not see what the shape and size of the light source and the size of embedding in the umbral cases imply in the context of partial order or semantics. Also, readers do not see how we select one of the 4 proposed methods depending on the situation.\n1. Overall, the paper is written as a technical extension of the hyperbolic entailment cone method, but the current draft does not position the proposed method well in the context of the whole partial order embedding area. It is not an unacceptable way, but limits the readers. The authors might want to compare it with other methods such as Order embedding, Gaussian embedding, Box embedding, etc.\n1. The title of the paper lacks essential keywords and confuses readers. It should include the word \"shadow cone.\" Also, if possible, the words \"hierarchy\" or \"partial order\" could be included. Readers might think the phrase \"dark side\" indicates the surface of a hemisphere, rather than a shadow cone. Also, from the word \"moon,\" readers feel the impression that the embedding has a volume. However, this is not the case for the penumbral cone embedding. I am aware that we have many styles on which we title a paper, but, at least, we need to avoid confusing readers."

                        "value": "**What do the shape and size of the light source and the size of embedding in the umbral cases imply in the context of partial order or semantics?**\n\nThis is a very interesting question that we would like to explore with an additional experiment. Specifically, we modified our existing framework to learn source radius from data. **Figure 3 and 4 of the supplementary rebuttal pdf** show the learned embedding as well as light source radius. For the mammal dataset, the source radius quickly expands from its initial size, resulting in a converged radius that is very large compared to the distribution of learned embeddings. We think this might be a result of the connectivity of the underlying data. The mammal graph has only four disconnected components, and is thus highly interconnected. A large light source can cast large penumbral shadows, making it easier to model highly connected DAGs. In follow-up work, we would be interested in exploring whether different data can induce radius of different sizes, and quantify if there is a relation between source radius and graph connectivity.\n\n**How to select one of the 4 proposed methods depending on the situation?**\n\nIn general, we recommend using shadow cones in the half-space model as there\u2019s no $\\epsilon$-hole issue compared to the Poincar\u00e9-ball model. If the goal is to represent partial order data with maximal accuracy as represented by the F1 score, then our experiments show Umbral-half-space to be the best method. \n\nIf there are requirements or potential benefits from geodesic convexity, we recommend using the Penumbral-half-space cone. For example, if one were to perform interpolations between nodes, then perhaps Penumbral-half-space is superior as it achieves a relatively high F1 score, and its cones are geodesically convex. \n\nFor multi-relation embeddings, where one desires to learn the sizes and positions of multiple light sources, each casting a different colored shadow, we recommend the Penumbral or Umbral-Poincar\u00e9-ball, because the half-space formulations restrict the size and position of the light source. In umbral-half-space, the light source is placed at infinity, while in penumbral-half-space, the light source is infinitely large. We discussed multi-relation embeddings in Appendix H.\n\nWe sincerely thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestions on a more representative title. We agree and plan to change our title in the updated manuscript to: **Shadow Cones: Unveiling Partial Orders in Hyperbolic Space**. We would like to refer the reviewer to our general response, where we explain the performance disparity between Penumbral-Poincar\u00e9-ball and entailment cones."

I feel the results are very suggestive. It partially answers my question. However, what I exactly wanted to ask is your motivation to have a non-zero size embedding and light source, relating it to partial order or semantics. As I pointed out, not explaining at all WHY you proposed each of the four methods is a significant concern to me.\n\n- *If the goal is to represent partial order data with maximal accuracy as represented by the F1 score, then our experiments show Umbral-half-space to be the best method.*\n\n**My comments**: I appreciate it. However, it sounds an ad-hoc reason in the sense that we first need to see the experimental results to understand the advantage of each method. It would be ideal to have a non ad-hoc explanation. Specifically, I would request the authors to explain the motivation for proposing each of the four proposed methods before introducing it in the paper so that readers can understand the difference in the motivations of the four proposed methods.\n\n- *We sincerely thank the reviewer for the thoughtful suggestions*\n\n**My comments**: I'm glad if I contributed to the clarity of the title. At the same time, I would like the authors to double-check whether my suggestion matches your paper's motivation the most. I believe the phrase \"shadow cone\" should be in the title, but if you simply say \"Unveiling Partial Orders,\" readers would immediately think the motivation had already been achieved by (Ganea et al. 2018) and it might lose readers. I am aware that I might have given you pressure on that matter. I am also aware that, possibly, you were unwilling to add the phrase \"partial order\" but had to add it since I encouraged so as a reviewer. I apologize for it if it was the case. In any case, as a member of the ICLR community, I simply hope that you will have a title that matches your paper the best. I hereby declare that I do not object to the paper title as long as the authors include the phrase \"shadow cone.\" This is to make sure the author will not feel pressure for an unnecessary change of the title.\n\n\n**Overall comments**: I will keep the current score. The reason I could not raise my score simply lies in the presentation of the current manuscript. I believe that the presentation should be improved more but at the same time the technical parts are written well. I feel the benefits the ICLR community receives from the immediate acceptance of this paper surpass the benefits we receive from further presentation revision. This is why this paper is above the acceptance threshold. Still, I strongly encourage the authors to continue improving the presentation in the camera ready so that readers can understand the difference in the motivations of the four proposed methods"

                        "value": "**Claim on the Ease of Training**\n\nOur training routine is less complicated than that of the Entailment Cone, in the following two ways. \n1) While the entailment cone uses pretrained 100-epoch embedding as initialization in order to avoid the $\\epsilon$-hole issue in the Poincar\u00e9-ball, we simply use random initialization around the origin as a one-stage approach.\n2) Our half-space based cones and embeddings have no $\\epsilon$-hole issue at the origin, and need no extra steps to project the \u201cstray\u201d points out of the hole. \n\n**Relationship between convexity and performance**\n\nThis is an interesting question. As discussed in Appendix H, future works, we don\u2019t have a clear answer to it now. We expect geodesic convexity to be beneficial for certain types of data and the task objectives, which we would like to explore in follow-up works. \n\n**Challenges to learning representation in the half-space formulation**\nThere are always precision-related challenges in learning representations in any models of hyperbolic space. Such problems occur when the embedding is near the boundary of the model, i.e., $||x|| = 1$ in the Poincar\u00e9-ball model and $x_n=0$ in the Poincar\u00e9-half-space model. The limited precision of underlying floating-point computations (imprecision issue) can lead to unbounded error. Yet, the half-space model is already less prone to this issue compared to other models of hyperbolic space like the Poincar\u00e9-ball and Lorentz model, as studied in some previous work. \n\nWe would like to refer the reviewer to our general response for further comparisons with the box embedding baseline, the reason for the disparity between Penumbral-Poincar\u00e9-ball and entailment cones and other downstream tasks."

The authors show that such framework can be particularly efficient to learn a latent embeddings of nodes for trees or more generally for DAGs. Their method extends to the concept of entailment cones previously introduced by Ganea.

                        "value": "**How the method could be used for real world graphs that are not (exactly) DAGs?**\n\nWe propose shadow cones as a novel partial order embedding framework in hyperbolic space. Thus, we experiment on datasets with partial orders. Graphs that are not (exactly) DAGs deviate from the field of partial order embedding. For example, knowledge graphs, edge relations in KGs contain symmetric and other more complicated relations, which are not partial orders. Naively encoding them is likely to fail. It\u2019s an interesting and growing area to embed general (not necessarily DAG) graphs within a partial order embedding framework. An example is embedding with minimal spanning trees. Such methods are beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n**How the method could be used for multiclass hierarchical problems?**\n\nWe assume the reviewer is referring to multi-relation embeddings. This can be achieved using multiple light sources, with each light source casting shadows of one color that captures one type of relation. We briefly illustrated this idea in Appendix H. Multi-relation embedding is an exciting direction that we are interested in exploring in follow-up works.\n\n**Comparison with methods that do not rely on hyperbolic spaces**\n\nWe would like to refer the reviewer to our general response, where we compare our proposed shadow cones against box-embeddings, which is a type of Euclidean embedding.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing definition of $P$ (the set of positive relations) and $N$ (the set of negative relations), the error in section 3 paragraph 1, and after theorem 4.2. We will make sure to fix them in the updated manuscript."

I think some more discussion to related concepts such as DAG learning, which is learning DAGs from data [1,2,3], other hyperbolic hierarchical learning like hyperbolic tree learning, which is about learning trees to represent hyperbolic data or embed in hyperbolic apace [4,5], graph embeddings in hyperbolic space [6,7,8], and hyperbolic link prediction [9] would be great. \n\n2) I think the experimental setup could be further expanded upon. First, I think it should be clarified that we can do the link prediction without the embedding step (this would have a 100% accuracy) and then mention that you do the embedding step to understand the how well the embedding performs. As part of the experiment, it would be good to have a baseline for Euclidean poset embedding. However, I admit I do not know of one. Maybe on of the DAG learning papers has a baseline that could be used. \n\n3) Building on the above it would be good to show that such embeddings can be used other non-trivial down stream tasks and that such embeddings provide an advantage. \n\n[1] X.

I see that the umbral method seems to perform the best. I imagine based on how the loss in formulated this pushes the point to the interior of the cone rather than leaving it on the boundary where we might have numerical issues. \n\n4) Could the authors provide intuition for why umbral cones are not geodetically convex? I believe in this regard calling them cones might be a bit confusing, because cones in Euclidean space are not only convex, but contains these geodesic rays. I would have thought the same is true for the hyperbolic ones. Hence was surprised when I saw this result."

                        "value": "**Broader Contexts:**\nWe sincerely thank the reviewer for kindly suggesting broader literatures to contextualize our work within. We will incorporate discussions and comparisons with the suggested papers in section 2 of our updated manuscript.\n\n**Non-trivial downstream tasks:**\nWe would like to refer the reviewer to our general response section, where we discussed how cone-based attention could be used to improve the performance of attention models, and offer a simple classification task demonstrating how our partial order embedding captures meaningful structure in the mammal taxonomy data.\n\n**Question 3:**\n\nFirst we would like to remind the reviewer that all of our cone formulations are motivated by the same overarching idea: $u \\preceq v$ if and only if the (penumbral or umbral) shadow cast by $v$ is a subset of the shadow cast by $u$. The shape of the object (single point, or ball with volume) is dictated by the physicality of different types of shadows, and is not an arbitrary choice. Penumbral shadow, which results from partial eclipse of a light source with volume, is produced by a point object. \n\nOn the other hand, Umbral shadow, which results from total eclipse of a point light source, is produced by an object with volume. In order to satisfy the definition of the subset relation of (umbral and penumbral) shadows, we need the ball around objects $y$ to be in the shadow in the umbral cone, but only need the point $y$ to be in the shadow for the penumbral cone. \n\nThe Umbral-half-space cone performs the best in general. The reason can be multi-folds, including loss function and optimization process. However, we attribute its main advantage to the infinite-height light source, and lack of $\\epsilon$-hole at the origin.\n\n**Boundary computation and intuitive explanations why umbral cones are not geodesically convex**\n\nAs illustrated in the last question, Penumbral shadow, which results from partial eclipse of a light source with volume, is produced by a point object. Therefore, the boundaries of penumbral shadow are geodesics passing through $u$ while being tangent to the light source. Note that the $\\text{Penumbral Shadow}(v) \\subset \\text{Penumbral Shadow}(u)$ for any $v\\in \\text{Penumbral Shadow}(u)$, therefore, all possible children of $u$, i.e., penumbral cone of $u$ coincides with the penumbral shadow of $u$, with geodesics boundary described above. \n\nOn the other hand, Umbral shadow, which results from total eclipse of a point light source, is produced by an object with volume (a ball around $u$). Therefore, the boundary of umbral shadow is geodesics passing through the point light source, while being tangent to the ball around $u$. Now, let\u2019s look at all possible children $v$ of $u$, i.e., umbral cone of $u$. Since the objects $u$ and $v$ have volumes, then for $u \\preceq v$ to be true, it must be that $v$ and its ball are entirely immersed in $u$\u2019s shadow. Otherwise, the portion of $v$\u2019s ball outside of $u$\u2019s shadow can cast shadows outside. In **Figure 1 of the supplementary rebuttal pdf**, we sketch a case where $v$\u2019s center is in $u$\u2019s shadow, but nevertheless $u \\npreceq v$, because part of $v$\u2019s ball is outside.\n\nHence, the boundary of umbral cones are the set of points equidistant from the umbral shadow, aka, hypercycles in hyperbolic space, a well-studied geometric object. In Euclidean space, the set of points equidistant from a straight line forms another, parallel straight line. In contrast, in hyperbolic space, the set of points equidistant from a geodesic do *not* necessarily form a geodesic, and is instead referred to as a hypercycle. In **Figure 2 of the supplementary rebuttal pdf**, we illustrate the non-convexity of umbral cones in Poincar\u00e9 half-space. In green are the umbral cone boundaries, while in black are its convex hull - the minimum convex set - that contains the umbral cone. The boundaries of the convex hull are geodesics. We can see that the umbral cone is a strict subset of its convex hull, which means the umbral cone is not geodesically convex. We will include this illustration in the Appendix. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing definition of $P$ (the set of positive relations) and $N$ (the set of negative relations). We also agree with the suggestion on further explanation of the experimental setup. We will make sure to clarify and explain them in the updated manuscript. We would also like to refer the reviewer to our general response section, where we compare our proposed shadow cones against box-embeddings, which is a type of Euclidean embedding."

We will update the manuscript to explain all symbols in the figures. \n\n**Weakness 2:**\nWe believe the reviewer misunderstood our claim: shadow cones generalize hyperbolic entailment cones (Poincar\u00e9-ball based) to a broad class of formulations. The hyperbolic entailment cones are mathematically equivalent to a special case of shadow cones, namely, Penumbral-Poincar\u00e9-Ball. We understand that the reviewer might be puzzled by the performance difference of hyperbolic entailment cones and Penumbral-Poincar\u00e9-Ball, given that the two are mathematically equivalent. We would like to refer the reviewer to our explanation in the general responses. \n\nPoincar\u00e9 half-space based cones are another category of cones within the shadow cones, which are distinct from the Poincar\u00e9-Ball based formulations. We analyzed and discussed why Poincar\u00e9 half-space based formulations perform better than Poincar\u00e9-Ball based formulations in section 5, page 9, [Discussion on the impact of $\\epsilon$-hole]. \n\n**Weakness 3: Different light sources in Penumbral and Umbral cones**\n\nWe wanted to emphasize that whether the light source has volume is dictated by the physicality of different types of shadows, and is not an arbitrary choice. Penumbral shadow results from partial eclipse of the light source, and could only be produced by light source with volume. Umbral shadow, on the other hand, results from total eclipse of a point light source, and can be produced by both point-like light sources and objects with volume. When both the light source and objects have volume, a third type of shadow is produced - antumbral shadow, which we show in Appendix G to be mathematically equivalent to penumbral shadow formulations."

                        "value": "**Experiments on a wider variety of datasets from different domains or those with different characteristics (like KG etc.)**\n\nWe propose shadow cones as a novel partial order embedding framework in hyperbolic space. Thus, we experiment on datasets with partial orders. We augment our experiments with MCG and Hearst dataset beyond the standard Wordnet benchmark. Datasets from different domains or those with different characteristics are likely to deviate from the partial order embedding area. For example, knowledge graphs, edge relations in KGs contain symmetric and other more complicated relations, which are not partial orders. Naively encoding them is likely to fail. In fact, it\u2019s an interesting and growing area of embedding general relations in a partial order embedding framework, for example, with minimal spanning tree. Hence, we only consider datasets with partial order relations and it\u2019s beyond the scope of this paper to experiment on datasets and tasks from other domains.\n\nWe kindly thank the reviewer for suggesting further comparisons. We would like to refer the reviewer to our general response section, where we compare our proposed shadow cones against box-embeddings. We will update the captions of figures to improve the readability."
