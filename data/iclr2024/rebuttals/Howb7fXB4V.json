Should all channels in $i$-th group use the same max/average operator? Additionally, I am confused about how different pixels in the same channel adopt different operators.\n\n-: The experiments show the proposed PiX module can bring accuracy improvement over $1 \\times 1$ convolution. However, could the authors provide more rigorous theoretical analysis on this phenomenon?\n\n-: Could $\\phi(z)$ be implemented by some efficient ways, such as 1D convolution with the stride? Besides, more efficient channel attention or parameter-free attention could be compared to verify the effectiveness of PiX module."

                    "value": "I have several concerns about the evaluation and novelty of the proposed method.\n\n- The major component of the proposed method, namely Depth-wise pooling operation has already been proposed in [1] and [2]. The main differentiating factor seems to be the pick operator which learns to dynamically select between Average- and Max-pooling. However, the ablation study presented in the appendix (Table A5) shows that there is no significant increase in performance for having both operators and choosing among them. Top-1 Acc for \"only Average pooling\" is 76.58% vs 76.77% for Max+average pooling. If the selection between the two operators is the only novelty, the authors should show the added benefit for that. This ablation study should be in the main body and ideally presented for more models considered in the paper.\n\n- I have major concerns regarding fairness of the comparisons. The accuracies for competing methods are copy-pasted from their respective papers with possibly different training pipelines and hyperparameters. Most of the reported baseline numbers for the models in this paper are higher than the ones reported in the reference papers. A major concern is that the gap between the performances of different channel squeezing methods may come from improved baseline accuracies and not the proposed method. Since the accuracies of other methods are copy-pasted, I find the numbers reported in Table 6 and A1 in the supplementary misleading.\n\n- In Table 4, considering the relative drop in performance for different channel pruning methods  with respect to their corresponding baseline accuracies, it seems PiX is performing worse than several methods.\n\n\n\n[1] Abid Hussain et al.
