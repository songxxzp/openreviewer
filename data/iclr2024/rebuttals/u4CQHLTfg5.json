The authors claim that individual fairness can be considered as individual fairness by taking each individual example as a sole group. Then the authors proceed to formulate expressions for individual cost based on the cost utility. Through the visualizations the authors suggest the trade-off is between fairness and accuracy, rather than between individual fairness and group fairness."

The main motivation is the stated inconsistency between the empirical evidence about the trade-offs between individual and group fairness, and the theoretical argument for the alignment between the two notions. This paper resolved this inconsistency in two ways. First, the authors showed that individual fairness can be framed as an extension of group fairness. Second, the authors looked into the early work providing empirical evidence, and clarified that the individual fairness notion studied in the early work captures fairness with respect to individual cost. Moreover, through detailed mathematical analysis, they argued that the empirical trade-off between group and individual fairness actually reflects the trade-off between fairness and utility."

(2018) Considering the large volume of fair ML literature, I am not convinced about the general usefulness of providing further explanation of results from one single paper. In addition, the current paper uses the conflicting empirical trade-off from Speicher et al. (2018) and the philosophical argument from Binns (2019) as the main motivation. I disagree with the claimed conflict. Binns (2019) adopted the individual fairness notion from Dwork et al. (2011), but Speicher et al. (2018) discussed in their Section 2.4 that their individual unfairness measure follows different principle from Dwork et al. (2011). Therefore, it is not surprising that the two papers concluded different results about individual-group fairness trade-offs. \n\nAbout the analysis done in the current paper (Section 5), I see a disconnection between the derivation and the conclusion. The conclusion mentioned utility-fairness trade-off, but the utility definition is never clearly stated in the paper. It is therefore unclear what the utility-fairness trade-off is. \n\nFor the other set of contributions about connecting individual and group fairness, I find the observation that individual fairness can be interpreted as an extreme case of group fairness as group size approaches 1 to be straightforward."

If so, why did the authors study the results from Speicher et al. (2018) in particular?"

                    "value": "__Question 1__: the difference between the presented formulation of individual fairness, and the original definition presented in Dwork et al. (2011)\n\nIn the original individual fairness definition (Dwork et al., 2011), the prediction mapping is from input features to target variable ($M: V \\rightarrow \\Delta(A)$, where $V$ are features, and $A$ denotes outcome in their notation). In this work, the authors consider a generative modeling $\\mathcal{X} \\times \\mathcal{Y} \\rightarrow [0, 1]$, as in the definition of Lipschitz Continuity presented in Section 3. The definition claims to consider the mapping from \"individuals to probability distribution over\" outcome $Y$, then why $\\hat{y} = f(x, y)$ take both $x$ and $y$ as input? If instead $f(x, y) \\in \\mathcal{P}$ (as specified in the paper), the output of $f(\\cdot)$ is a distribution over outcome, instead of predicted value? The mathematical formulation is very confusing.\n\n__Question 2__: the analyzing approach of individual fairness, where \"error in features\" are introduced\n\nIn Section 3.1, individual fairness as error damping, a Taylor expansion is presented. Following the above question, I am not sure how to parse this expansion. On the one hand, only the slight variation in features $x$ is included and only the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$ is included in the expansion, which seems to suggest that a discriminative (instead of generative) modeling is of interest. On the other hand, when both $x$ and $y$ are considered in the multivariate function $f(x, y)$, it is not reasonable to assume $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}$ to always be 0 for any $(\\tilde{x}, y)$ combination. I am having difficulty parsing the analyzing approach, especially considering the fact that randomness/error $\\epsilon$ plays an important role in the presented discussion on individual fairness.\n\n__Question 3__: what are the implications of the presented theorems?\n\nReaders can benefit from more discussions on the implication of presented Theorems 1 -- 3. How to parse them and connect them to the discussion of individual fairness?\n\n__Minor typo__: \n\n- Page 3: Section 3.1 \"for any error [in? or related to?] our features\""
