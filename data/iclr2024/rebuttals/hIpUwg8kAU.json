Combining previous results from different areas in a concrete NN setting is surely novel. \n\nQuality: This paper applies a plenty of technical lemmata to provide a rigorous proof. As said, the bound in this paper is still far from the minimax optimal rate, but it is a good attempt.\n\nClarity: All the constants are tracked, and definitions are given in the main text or in the appendix, thus the paper is self-containing.\n\nSignificance: The field of machine learning theory has devoted much effort on approximation error, generalisation error and the optimisation error separately. It is encouraging to combine previous work to give a bound on the estimation (total) error. Also, the main theorem gives a good scaling on the hyper parameters like width, initialisation, learning rate for 3-layer sigmoidal NN, which could serve as theoretical and empirical reference for future research."

Also, since this paper deals with 3-layer NN. I wonder if there is already similar result for 2-layer NN, which I cannot find this paper citing. \n\n2. I understand there are many constants and symbols in the paper due to the circumstances of the paper, but I find it confusing to have $L,L_n,L_\\sigma$ all representing different things. \n\n3.

Optimisation error is proved using PL condition that the optimal weight is near to the initialisation. Is it too restrictive for realistic case?\n\n5. Could you provide any experimental result?

Although the paper is thorough and comprehensive, I\u2019m not sure how much novelty it provides compared to previous work technically, and whether the bound, for example, the lower bound of the widths of each layer, is optimal compared with previous papers. \n\nIs the novelty about constraints? Does the optimization path interact with the boundary of feasible set, or the feasible set is so large that once the initial point is far from boundary, since it moves a small distance, the constraints are never hit?\n\nThe NN structure is quite special that each layer has to be some sort of shape and the architecture is simple. As practical NN is developing, it would make more sense to present a generic method or discussion that can be applied to many types of NNs. \n\nIt is fine that the bound terms are complicated and not intuitive, but it makes the paper readable if we see more discussions, like which term is bottleneck, how to insert some intermediate values (such as $B$ with different sub/superscripts) to get the bound in informal Thm.\n\nIt is better to give lower bound of $n$ rather saying \u201csufficiently large\u201d.\n\nI am not sure if any practical NN applications have \"iterates moving locally\" so that one can use kernels, and people usually use regularizers. Is there an experiment or practical observation that verifies the phenomenon in this paper in practice?"

At least two aspects of discussion are missing: (i) what the results indicate, and (ii) how the results are compared to previous results quantitatively.\n2. There are a lot of notations in Section 3.2, and I would be happy to see more explanations about what how these notations mean. For example, $L$ looks like a Lipschitz constant and $\\mu$ looks like the coefficient of strong convexity. If the use of these notations are too technical, I would recommend putting them in the appendices, and the author could just mention the existence of these requirements in the main text.\n3. The notations of $I_{k_1}^{(1)}$ $I_{k_2}^{(2)}$ are a bit confusing to me. I failed to find $I_{k_1}^{(1)}$ used anywhere in the main text. Also, the definition of the neural networks in Eq. (2) and how $I_{k_2}^{(2)}$ is used look a bit strange to me\n4. The comments after Theorem 3 claims that Theorem 3 is a result of **constrained** optimization. However, boundedness is hardly enforced in practice, and I am skeptical about whether this is a contribution.\n5. The motivation of the authors studying a **3-layer** network is a bit unclear to me. I am expecting to see the technical contributions if the analysis of three-layer networks embodies some intrinsic difficulties (and the proof sketch should probably highlight the technical contributions). I am also curious about the method in this work can be extended to networks of arbitrary depth."

As the indications of the main result appear a bit unclear to me, does the result obtained in this work indicate that there is extra tradeoff between optimization, approximation and generalization compared to the scenario when we only consider two of the aspects?"
