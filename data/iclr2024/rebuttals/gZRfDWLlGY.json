From the context, s denotes the iteration and t denotes the training data index, does \\theta_s(t) refer to a parameter specific to data point t?\n2. Theorem 3.1 is the foundation of the proposal but the proof does not seem to be rigorous: it states that \u03b8_{s+1} \u2261 \u03b8_s + d\u03b8_{s(t)} / dt, is a step size missing there?\n3. The OOD is obtained by analyzing the span of the linear subspace formed by the loss gradient vectors. However, the analysis may not take into account the nonlinearity."

                        "value": "Thank you for reviewing our manuscript and providing your insightful critiques. We appreciate you taking the time to thoroughly review our work.\n\nIn response to your first concern, you are correct, a definition for $\\varepsilon$ was missing. In this case $\\varepsilon$ represents the learning rate hyperparameter of the neural network and we have added a comment defining it as such to the definitions in Theorem 3.1.\nIn regards to $\\theta_s(t)$ the definition of this value can be found in section 3 equation 7 and the relevant properties of $\\theta_s(t)$ as it relates to $\\theta_s$ are defined in equations 5 and 6. We agree that the notation of this section may be confusing, so we have clarified the domain of $t$ and added a section explaining the properties of $\\theta_s(t)$.\n\nWe understand your concerns about the limitations of linear methods to address the nonlinear nature of neural networks. We have substantially revised section 4 in order to discuss these details in a clearer way.  In both of our applications, the nonlinearity of the model is contained in how the model spatially transforms and represents the data for the task. Both in parameter space and in input space, this generates nonlinear (curved) spatial arrangements of data. Although this decomposition can be used to analyze nonlinearity, our applications to both OOD and dimension measurement are limited to the tangent space around specific individual data. In this context, the tangent space is linear. Our revised section 4 addresses the implications of our choice to pick a linear basis for the final trained state and extend that basis across all training steps. An exact decomposition of a prediction into contributions for each training point requires a non-linear basis across the space of training paths. However, since the training path is fixed, we can still explain all variation by only looking at the linear subspaces for each training step. This is subtle but useful and relies on the fact that the training gradients in this representation do not depend on $t$. We justify reducing this down to only a truncated basis for the final training step after Corollary 4.2. We hope that these revisions address your concerns and questions, and we greatly value your continued feedback to continue clarifying these subtle details. \n\nWe sincerely appreciate you taking the time to thoughtfully review our work. Your insights have undoubtedly helped us strengthen this manuscript."

This methodology was first introduced by Bell et al. 2023. In addition, the paper extends the approach to provide a more generalized representation of the output of a test point under general loss functions. Moreover, it establishes a connection between exact path kernels and out-of-distribution (OOD) methods such as GradNorm, GradOrth, ReAct, DICE, and others, all of which rely on the utilization of parameter gradients. The paper also delves into the exploration of using a modified Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to estimate the signal manifold."

We appreciate you taking the time to provide an in-depth review and value your expertise in improving the quality of our work.\n\nWe understand your concerns about the limitations of the gEPK and its similarity to prior work. Per your recommendations, we have made revisions to improve this aspect in the beginning of section 3. We now more clearly indicate the differences between work done previously by Bell et al. and our paper. In addition we have revised Section 4 in order to provide more detail on the novelty of our approach.\n\nRegarding your concern of differences between accounting for the training path or evaluating only at the final trained state, we have addressed this issue in the revised section 4. You will now find Theorem 4.1 which refers to the most general basis for all training parameter gradients along the path and Corollary 4.2 which discusses the use of a reduced basis and discusses a justification for using only the final training state. This provides a more rigorous foundation for gradient based OOD by taking into account this full decomposition, and also places many cutting edge OOD approaches in a more rigorous and interpretable context by highlighting their relation (as truncations or as implicit subspaces) to the subspaces and basis we define. There is more work to be done on this in order to bring it into a practical setting. In response to your concern we have added more discussion surrounding this topic to the conclusion of this paper.\n\nThank you again for your help in improving the quality of this work. If you have any further questions or concerns we would be happy to continue this discussion."

If this is just training via gradient descent, it might be easier to simply write down the GD equation.\n    * The input and output space of $f$ don't seem to be defined.\n    * Making sense of Eq.

We have carefully considered all of the suggestions you provided in your review. In response, we have made the following changes to the manuscript:\n\n - Substantially revised Section 4 for clarity and to highlight our contributions to the detailed theory needed to use this method to decompose projections. \n - Added a description to Theorem 3.1 indicating that these constraints are satisfied by gradient descent\n-  Added definitions for the input and output space of the network function $f$\n - Removed the RHS of equation (8) as it was indeed in error and could cause confusion\n - Simplified the notation surrounding the loss gradient to improve the clarity of our equations\n - Clarified the definition of $\\epsilon$ in Theorem 3.1 to be the learning rate of the neural network\n\nThe focus of this paper is on the use of a generalized exact path kernel to decompose predictions. In order to present this theoretical framework in a readable, complete, and transparent way, we have included a proof of the generalized representation which is derived from Bell et al. This is not our main contribution. Our main theoretical contribution is in the application of this representation to decompose predictions and the consideration of many details including how this decomposition applies across training steps and model layers. We have presented these details alongside applications to OOD and manifold dimension measurement to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of this approach. While we agree that building this analysis into a framework that performs OOD detection and testing it on benchmark datasets is of value; this is a significant task which could stand on its own as a contribution to a more application focused venue, and so we consider it future work.\n\nWe would be happy to provide any additional information needed during the next steps of the review process. Thank you again for your time and for helping enhance our research. We greatly appreciate the effort you have put into reviewing our manuscript."

I believe that the provided decomposition can have interesting applications including OOD detection and manifold dimension estimation as presented by the authors. However, I believe the current work can be significantly strengthened if it can either show more formal connections and comparisons with theoretical guarantees between recent OOD methods through this decomposition, or can use the intuitions to come up with modifications to current methods that provide meaningful improvements. These issues are perhaps best addressed in a new submission. For this reason, I am keeping my original score."
