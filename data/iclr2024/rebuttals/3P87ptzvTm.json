They propose an algorithm to solve an associated optimization problem,  which is an extension of the Sinkhorn algorithm. After making links with the traveling salesman problem (TSP), they present two applications of their algorithm to visual multi-point matching and multi model fusion, where the proposed approach leads to benefits in terms of performance."

However, and this is preventing me from giving an higher score, there are a number of issues with this paper. Provided that some of them are solved during the discussion phase, I will be willing to change my evaluation.  Here are potential questions and remarks for the authors :\n\n- Existence of solution for Eq 9 should be discussed. Notably, it seems that as soon as there is mass splitting or whenever one measure has a small number of atoms, the composition (product) of couplings can not yield identity (as soon as there might be rank deficiency in the coupling matrix), and the feasible set is empty. In the reviewer\u2019s opinion, this should be detailed or analyzed. \n\n- Regarding the optimization part, there is no clear justification for the alternating scheme proposed here (solving sinkhorns, then updating the cost matrix for every sub-problems). I think there might be connections to Generalized Conditional Gradients or Majoration-Minimization methods here (as the ones used in the POT library). I encourage the authors to better justify their algorithm 1. Also, what is the impact of the entropy parameter $\\epsilon$ in solving the problem (10) ? How do you set it ? How many iterations wrt. K are needed for finding a solution ? In the reviewer\u2019s opinion, this would deserve a discussion in the paper. \n\n- Authors do not mention the case when K=2. However, I believe that it might also be interesting. In the case where the number of samples (atoms) is the same in the two distributions (with uniform distributions), we have obviously that $P P^T = Id$ but when  mass splitting occur,  it is not always the case. What is then the impact of the regularization on the original sinkhorn problem ?  \n\n- In the applications of OMT (visual point matching, or neural model fusion), how do you define the sequences/orderings of measures ? Are there any change in the performances if one changes this ordering (as we can expect because of the non-commutativity of coupling matrices product) ?  More generally, and as soon as K>2, I guess that the choice of the cycle (when given a set of input measures) is in itself a problem. It could be better discussed in the paper  \n\nMinor comments\n - in Eq 7 the first k should be a capital K\n- I do not really understand the difference between Eq. 10 and 17 \n- Figure 3 could be enhanced to better distinguish the differences between the two versions of the transport plans, which is difficult to see at a first glance \n- p6, what do you mean by \u2018\u2026 Algorithm 2 can not achieve the ideal closed-loop solution which may be\ndue to the simple setting of \u03b4k and too many regularized terms of closed-loop constraints\u2019 ? \n- in Multi point matching, performance measures such as CR or CACC show a bias toward the presented method, since it directly relates to the criterion which is optimized."

                        "value": "**** Q1. how to build a cycle (ordering of measures for $K>2$) is not discussed in the paper\n\n**** A1. For $K=3$, consider three sets: $A$, $B$, and $C$, with a mapping order defined as $A\\to B$, $B\\to C$, and $C\\to A$, represented by matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_1$, $\\mathbf{P}_2$, and $\\mathbf{P}_3$. Consistency requires that $\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. If we switch the order to $A\\to C$, $C\\to B$, and $B\\to A$, with matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_3^\\top$, $\\mathbf{P}_2^\\top$, and $\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top$, the consistency becomes $\\mathbf{P}_3^\\top\\mathbf{P}_2^\\top\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top=\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. Therefore, for the case of three measures ($K=3$), switching the order (of Fig. 5) does not affect the problem formulation.We test the experiments on Willow_3GM with IPCA-GM as backbone and the results are given as follows. Although the problems with and without switching the order are equivalent, the results may differ slightly due to initialization and other factors.\n\n| Willow_3GM with IPCA-GM       |  ACC    | CACC   | CR     |\n| ------------------------------|------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn : A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192A | 0.9506 | 0.9031 | 0.9500 |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn : A\u2192C, C\u2192B, B\u2192A | 0.9459 | 0.8974 | 0.9477 |\n\nAs for $K>3$, switching the order does indeed impact the formulation of the problem. However, note our directed cyclical structure is essentially a subgraph of pairwise structure. When the latter is satisfied, the former is also satisfied, allowing our method to still improve the matching performance. We show the experiments of switching the **second** and **third** set order as follows:\n\n| Willow_4GM with  IPCA-GM               | ACC    | CACC   | CR     |\n| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn without switching        | 0.9453 | 0.8592 | 0.9240 |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn with switching the order | 0.9460 | 0.8557 | 0.9222 |\n\nIt can be observed that the results with and without switching the order are actually very close to each other.\n\n**** Q2.  Justification for the alternating scheme. I think there might be connections to Generalized Conditional Gradients or Majoration-Minimization methods here.\n\n**** A2. We initially proposed ROMT-Sinkhorn by referencing the computation and derivation of the Entropic Gromov-Wasserstein Distance. We are grateful to the reviewer for reminding us to understand our ROMT-Sinkhorn from the perspective of optimization algorithm frameworks. While we believe that ROMT-Sinkhorn does not seem to have a direct connection with Generalized Conditional Gradients or Majoration-Minimization, we have discovered that it can be associated with the **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)**. The outer loop of our algorithm essentially optimizes different variables $\\{\\mathbf{P}_k\\}_k$, while the inner Sinkhorn iterative loop optimizes multipliers ${(f_k,g_k)}_k$. Once again, we appreciate the reviewer's reminder, which has provided further optimization potential for ROMT-Sinkhorn.\n\n**** Q3. The existence to problem (8)\n\n**** A3. Thanks to the reviewer for pointing out the limitation in the existence of problem (8) theoretically. The existence problem is both important and challenging, and currently, we are unable to provide proof of its existence. However, we firmly believe that in the matching setting (i.e., $\\mathbf{a}^k=\\mathbf{1}_n$), a solution to the problem (8) does exist. \n\nIn the general case, it seems to be related to the probability vectors ${\\mathbf{a}^k}$ and the dimension numbers ${n_k}$. From the perspective of degrees of freedom, for any given $P_k$, assuming $\\{P_s\\}_{s\\neq k}$, \n\nthere exist $n_k\\times n_{k+1}$ variables and $n_k+n_{k+1}-1+n_1^2$ equations. This suggests that when $n_k>>n_1$ and $n_{k+1}>>n_1$, the equations have infinitely many solutions.\n\n**** Q4. $K=2$ case. I believe that it might also be interesting. In the case where the number of samples (atoms) is the same in the two distributions (with uniform distributions), we have obviously that $PP^T=I$. When mass splitting occur, it is not always the case. What is then the impact of the regularization on the original sinkhorn problem ?\n\n**** A4. We appreciate the reviewer for bringing up an interesting special case. In fact, for $K=2$, the consistency condition is not $PP^T=I$, but rather $diag(1/a)PP^Tdiag(1/b)=I$, where $a$ and $b$ are marginals. Additionally, when using entropic regularization for coupling, the consistency to $I$ is no longer satisfied because the coupling matrix is no longer sparse. This leads to the product of these matrices also being non-sparse."

I appreciate the efforts put into this process. \nI think some issues remain:\n - in answer to Q1, you highlight the fact that the consistencies are equivalent with respect to the order in which you go through the sets A, B and C. This is a nice observation, but this is only true at convergence, and if and only if Identity can be reached by the optimization algorithm, and if such a solution exists and is in the feasible set;\n - In answer to Q2, I believe the connection to ADMM could be described in the paper;\n - for Q3 I understand that the problem of establishing a formal existence of non-emptiness of the solution set is difficult for the general case. I still think that this is a major issue, as far as it is not clear what the proposed regularization is actually achieving in this case. A solution (less general though) might be to solely frame the problem in the context of assignment (same number of atoms + uniform distribution for all the measures) .\n\nI will keep my initial score for this submission. I still believe that the content is valuable and the idea of cycle consistency is neat and interesting, but I think that the paper is not ready for publication"

In particular, in the sample/distribution matching tasks, many OT-based methods can be used to achieve multi-source matching, e.g., Wasserstein barycenter [1], Multi-marginal OT (MMOT) [2], and so on. \n\n5. I suggest the authors add a stronger ablation study about the effectiveness of the cycle-consistency regularizer. More baselines[3] should be considered in the experiment of Fig.5.\n\n[1] Cuturi, Marco, and Arnaud Doucet. \"Fast computation of Wasserstein barycenters.\" International conference on machine learning.

                        "value": "#### Q1: I don\u2019t find much novelty in the idea of minimizing the transportation costs between each pair of distributions and using the constraint $\\prod_k \\tilde{P}_k=I$. It\u2019s also quite common to apply entropy regularization and transform the cycle-consistency into a regularizer.\n\n#### A1: We have to feel sorry that you (and perhaps also other readers) think the constraint $\\prod_k \\tilde{P}_k=I$ for OMT not sufficiently novel, which is worth our further expaination. Specifically, we would like to clarify the following points: 1) Adding this constraint to OT is not an easy task for solving, and adopting the F-norm for relaxation might be the most straightforward computational approach. We have also experimented with alternative norms/divergences, all of which failed with the iterative Sinkhorn method. 2) Our main objective is to achieve consistency among multiple OT solutions, and the mentioned constraint is just one way of achieving this goal. Previous works have not explored this aspect. 3\uff09Transportation consistency has strong implications. In addition to the connection with the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) mentioned in the paper, we believe it is also related to the Dynamic Formulation of OT, which describes the OT between two measures as a curve linking with fluid dynamics.\n\n#### Q2: What about the runtime efficiency of OMT? It would be nice if the authors could show the convergence curve of the proposed algorithm.\n\n#### A2: The time complexity of ROMT-Sinkhorn is $L$ times that of the pair-wise Sinkhorn, where $L$ represents the number of iterations. The convergence curve is presented in the new paper version in the Fig. 6 in Appendix, where the error is defined as the mean of the L2 norm between the couplings of two iterations. As for the runtime,  the results are given as follows:\n\n| Experiment | runtime of pair-wise Sinkhorn(s) | runtime of ROMT-Sinkhorn(s) |\n| ---------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- |\n| Willow_3GM | 0.0113                           | 0.0583                      |\n| Willow_4GM | 0.0150                           | 0.0782                      |\n| Willow_5GM | 0.0188                           | 0.0989                      | \n\n#### Q3: What about the stability of OMT? Given K sample sets/distributions, the method requires organizing the sets as a loop. Is it robust to the order of the sets? An analytic experiment should be added.\n\n#### A3: About the order of sets, we first consider three measure case with $A$, $B$, and $C$, with a mapping order defined as $A\\to B$, $B\\to C$, and $C\\to A$, represented by matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_1$, $\\mathbf{P}_2$, and $\\mathbf{P}_3$. Consistency requires that $\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. If we switch the order to $A\\to C$, $C\\to B$, and $B\\to A$, with matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_3^T$, $\\mathbf{P}_2^T$, and $\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top$, the consistency becomes $\\mathbf{P}_3^\\top\\mathbf{P}_2^\\top\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top=\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. Therefore, for the case of three measures ($K=3$), switching the order (of Fig. 5) does not affect the problem formulation. We test the experiments on Willow_3GM with IPCA-GM as backbone and the results are given as follows. Although the problems with and without switching the order are equivalent, the results may differ slightly due to initialization and other factors.\n\n| Willow_3GM with IPCA-GM       |  ACC    | CACC   | CR     |\n| ------------------------------|------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn : A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192A | 0.9506 | 0.9031 | 0.9500 |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn : A\u2192C, C\u2192B, B\u2192A | 0.9459 | 0.8974 | 0.9477 |\n\n\n\nAs for $K>3$, switching the order does indeed impact the formulation of the problem. However, note our directed cyclical structure is essentially a subgraph of pairwise structure. When the latter is satisfied, the former is also satisfied, allowing our method to still improve the matching performance. We show the experiments of switching the **second** and **third** set order as follows:\n\n| Willow_4GM with  IPCA-GM               | ACC    | CACC   | CR     |\n| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn without switching        | 0.9453 | 0.8592 | 0.9240 |\n| ROMT-Sinkhorn with switching the order | 0.9460 | 0.8557 | 0.9222 |\n\nIt can be observed that the results with and without switching the order are actually very close to each other."

In fact, it is not much different from the one using Sinkhorn.\n\n#### A1: We address the question with following three points: 1) Many experimental results demonstrate that our RMOT-Sinkhorn algorithm significantly improves upon the pairwise Sinkhorn algorithm which is evident in the enhanced performance of CR and CACC metrics and most cases in ACC evaluation. 2) There may exist some misunderstandings that RMOT-Sinkhorn is not only for the last mapping. All the mapping will be affected (e.g. results in Fig.3).   3) RMOT-Sinkhorn is an iterative Sinkhorn method, which is similar to calculating the entropic Gromov-Wasserstein Distance. The key lies in effectively and reasonably calculating the modification of the cost matrix, which is not a straightforward task.\n\n\n#### Q2: I do not agree with other two metrics, i.e CR and CACC, assessing the performance of methods, since they favor the author's method.\n\n#### A2: In fact, similar metrics to CR have been widely used in literature in terms of multiple objects matching, e.g. specifically in Fig. 4(e) of [1] and the reference therein e.g. [2] which could be regarded as a special case of ours when everytime the number of sets for consistency computing is three. Moreover, CR and CACC can be regarded as extensions and refinements of ACC for multiple sets. They have meaningful and interpretable implications. We can redefine ACC from a matrix computation perspective as follows:\n$$\n   ACC = \\frac{1}{n} <\\prod_{k=1}^2(\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_k\\odot \\mathbf{Y}_k),\\mathbf{I}_n>\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{Y}_k$ represents the ground truth as a one-hot matrix. $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_1$ is the probability matrix for matching from the first set of points to the second set, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_2$ is the probability matrix for matching from the second set to the first set. In this particular case, we have $\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_1= \\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_2^\\top$ and $\\mathbf{Y}_1=\\mathbf{Y}_2^\\top$. From this perspective, we define the CR and CACC metrics, incorporating the concept of K-marginal transportation:\n$$\n    \\text{CR} = \\frac{1}{n}<\\prod_{k=1}^K\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_k,\\mathbf{I}_n> \\text{ and } \\text{CACC}=\\frac{1}{n}<\\prod_{k=1}^K(\\hat{\\mathbf{P}}_k\\odot \\mathbf{Y}_k),\\mathbf{I}_n>\n$$\nNote that $CR$ refers to the accuracy of forming cycles through matching, capturing the ability to establish correct pairwise matches within the set of $K$ points. On the other hand, CACC represents the accuracy of correctly matching all $K$ points, taking into account the entire cycle instead of only considering pairs of points as in traditional ACC metrics. \n\n\n#### Q3: I do not see that the method is natural application to those problems unless the data sets have cyclical structures (e.g. Switching the order of Fig. 5).\n\n#### A3: #### A3: Our model can be applied to various datasets [3], particularly those involving multi-modal data for matching. The reviewer may be concerned about the choice of order because natural datasets often exhibit more of a pairwise structure rather than a directed cyclical structure. However, this does not affect the usability of our model. To illustrate, consider three sets: $A$, $B$, and $C$, with a mapping order defined as $A\\to B$, $B\\to C$, and $C\\to A$, represented by matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_1$, $\\mathbf{P}_2$, and $\\mathbf{P}_3$. Consistency requires that $\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. If we switch the order to $A\\to C$, $C\\to B$, and $B\\to A$, with matching matrices $\\mathbf{P}_3^\\top$, $\\mathbf{P}_2^\\top$, and $\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top$, the consistency becomes $\\mathbf{P}_3^\\top\\mathbf{P}_2^\\top\\mathbf{P}_1^\\top=\\mathbf{P}_1\\mathbf{P}_2\\mathbf{P}_3=\\mathbf{I}$. Therefore, for the case of three measures ($K=3$), switching the order (of Fig. 5) does not affect the problem formulation.\n\nFor $K>3$, switching the order does indeed impact the formulation of the problem for datasets that exhibit pairwise relationships. However, note our directed cyclical structure is essentially a subgraph of pairwise structure. When the latter is satisfied, the former is also satisfied, allowing our method to still improve the matching performance. Besides, we can select multiple directed cyclical structures for OMT to achieve equivalence of pairwise structure one."

                        "value": "#### Q4: the guideline for choosing the parameter $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\n#### A4: We search for the optimal values of $\\delta$ and $\\epsilon$ in the validation dataset by maximizing the mean values of ACC and CACC metrics. Once determined, we apply these values to the testing data for evaluation.\n\n#### Q5: it also appears to be a slightly different version of multi-OT problems, thus it looks like an incremental solution to some current methods.\n\n#### A5: The key of Multi-marginal OT is the definition of cost tensor and if one can define the cost function among multiple marginals with consistency constraints, our OMT will become a subproblem of Multi-marginal OT. However, for the calculation, Multi-Marginal OT has an exponential increase in spatial complexity (N^K) as the number of marginals increases, while our method has a linear increase (NK), which is also a main difference.\n\n#### Q6: In table 1, why does the Sinkhorn perform better than RMOT-Sinkhorn in PCA-GM in the ACC index?\n\n#### A6: The regularization introduced by RMOT-Sinkhorn essentially increases the probability of forming cycles, ensuring that any given feature starts from the origin and returns to the origin. However, it does not guarantee an increase in the accuracy of each individual match within the cycle. For example, let's consider three sets: $A$, $B$, and $C$. Starting with the first feature $A[1]$, the prediction of Pairwise Sinkhorn is $A[1]\\to B[2]$, $B[2]\\to C[2]$, and $C[2]\\to A[2]$. The modification introduced by RMOT-Sinkhorn could result in a change of matches to $A[2]\\to B[2]$, $B[2]\\to C[2]$, and $C[2]\\to A[2]$. However, it is also possible for the modification to change the matches to $A[1]\\to B[2]$, $B[2]\\to C[2]$, and $C[2]\\to A[1]$. The latter case actually decreases the evaluation of ACC.\n\n#### Q7: In table 1, column NMGM, we have CR=100 but the ACC is only equal to 93.76. Does it mean that the consistent rate is not a good indicator of accuracy rate?\n\n#### A7: $CR=100\\%$  indicates that all the matches form cycles, but it does not guarantee that every individual match within the cycle is correct. On the other hand, a $CACC$ of $86.82%$ means that there are errors in one or more nodes within $13.18%$ of the cycles. Furthermore, one advantage of evaluating with $CR$ is that it does not require supervised data and it considers whether the predictions themselves are logically consistent, which is a strength of this evaluation metric.\n\nBTW, it has been widely recognized that consistency has an empirically strong correlation to accuracy in many public benchmarks e.g. [1,2]. We will also add more references to support this point.\n\n[1] Unifying Offline and Online Multi-Graph Matching via Finding Shortest Paths on Supergraph, IEEE TPAMI 2021\n[2] Multi-Graph Matching via Affinity Optimization with Graduated Consistency Regularization, IEEE TPAMI 2016\n[3] Artificial intelligence for multimodal data integration in oncology.

Similar to the reviewer aQyc, I think the criteria CACC and CR are biased to the presented method. For the CACC, its function is similar to the penalty function, namely, including product terms of \"transition matrices\". For the CR, it obtains 100% but the corresponding accuracy is only around 90%. Thus, I only trust ACC to compare the effectiveness between methods. Moreover, the ACC of ROMT-Sinkhorn are not always better than that of Sinkhorn alone (table 1, PCA-GM), even ROMT-Sinkhorn has extra parameter $\\delta$ to tune. \n\nHence, I would like to keep my score unchanged. I  believe there are a lot of room to improve the results theoretically and empirically. I agree with other reviewers that this version is not ready for publication."

OMT minimizes the total pairwise transportation costs while ensuring cycle consistency. By adding the entropic and cycle consistency regularization, OMT can be efficiently solved by an iterative Sinkhorn algorithm, termed ROMT-Sinkhorn. As a side product, the authors developed a new formulation for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The newly introduced problem, TSP-OMT, can be solved greedily in the probability space instead of the conventional distance space. Finally, empirical results showed the effectiveness of the proposed ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm in two applications: multi-point matching and multi-model fusion."

The experimental results are presented as follows: \n\n| Willow_3GM                   | ACC        | CACC       | CR         |\n| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| IPCA-GM-Hungarian            | 0.4003     | 0.2269     | 0.6303     |\n| IPCA-GM-EMD                  | 0.9426     | 0.8732     | 0.9141     |\n| IPCA-GM-Sinkhorn             | 0.9451     | 0.8776     | 0.9144     |\n| IPCA-GM-MMOT                 | 0.9422     | 0.8793     | 0.9057     |\n| IPCA-GM-ROMT-Sinkhorn (ours) | **0.9506** | **0.9031** | **0.9500** |\n\n| Willow_4GM                   | ACC        | CACC       | CR         | \n| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| IPCA-GM-Hungarian            | 0.3924     | 0.1610     | 0.5473     |\n| IPCA-GM-EMD                  | 0.9383     | 0.8221     | 0.8775     |\n| IPCA-GM-Sinkhorn             | 0.9381     | 0.8214     | 0.8693     |\n| IPCA-GM-MMOT                 | 0.9398     | 0.8268     | 0.8575     |\n| IPCA-GM-ROMT-Sinkhorn (ours) | **0.9453** | **0.8592** | **0.9240** |\n\nThe experimental setup for this experiment is the same as that described in Section A2. In terms of method comparison, Multi-Marginal OT has an exponential increase in spatial complexity ($O(N^2K)$) as the number of marginals increases, while our method has a linear increase ($O(N^2K)$). Note $N$ is the marginal dimension number (assuming the same) and $K$ is the number of marginal.\n\n#### Q3: In Tab. 3, for CIFAR10 + VGG11, the finetuned accuracy is the same as the best pre-trained one, which raises concerns about efficiency.\n\n#### A3: In Table 3, our OMT fusion method is compared to the OTfusion method, and it achieves better performance. However, it should be noted that not all fusion methods result in improved performance compared to the original models. It is normal for the fused model to have lower accuracy than the original model, especially in the case of multi-model fusion. The same accuracy between our method and the original one is actually a coincidence, as their actual prediction results are different.\n\n#### Q4: Minors and typos\n\n#### A4: Thank you for the reminder. We have made the corrections in the new PDF version. Thanks again.\n\n[1] Benamou, Jean-David, Guillaume Carlier, Marco Cuturi, Luca Nenna, and Gabriel Peyr\u00e9. \"Iterative Bregman projections for regularized transportation problems.\" SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 37, no. 2 (2015): A1111-A1138."

In addition, some experimental settings (e.g., baseline descriptions and hyperparameter settings) are missing. \n- Baselines: \"We compare our ROMT-Sinkhorn algorithm with (Munkres, 1957), EMD (Dantzig, 1949) and Sinkhorn Algorithm (Cuturi, 2013).\" -> Hungarian and MMOT are missing. While I understand what they are, the authors need to write them explicitly.\n- Hyperparameters: What are the choices of L, $\\epsilon$, $\\delta$ in the experiments? \n- The training procedures are also missing.\n\nFurther note: I hope that the authors take their time to write neat answers next time.\n\nI would like to keep my original score and agree with *Reviewer aQyc* that this manuscript is not ready for publication."
