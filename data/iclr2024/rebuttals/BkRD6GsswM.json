The key idea of the paper is to combine crowd-sourced annotation from annotators who are not necessarily experts and thus potentially unreliable (at least to some extent) with confidence estimations for individual annotators \u2014 combined these two ideas evidently lead to substantially improved classifiers, as evaluated on a range of standard UCI ML datasets."

I applaud the authors for a clear, technically sound presentation of a clever idea that evidently (as shown by the experimental evaluation) leads to improvements in classification accuracy for classifiers that are trained through active learning. While the related work part is a bit short, it covers relevant concepts and previous work in the field. The technical approach is nice: combining crowdsourcing with active learning, thereby taking into account that crowd annotators are not necessarily experts and then turning this around by assigning assumed confidence values to individual annotators through the majority voting on multiply labels samples and looking at consistency amongst individual annotators and their performance (with regard to the majority votes) is clever. Combining this with the budget constraint that is often used in active learning scenarios evidently leads to an effective active learning scheme. The experimental evaluation is solid. The authors did a good job in experimenting over a range of datasets (even though some more details on these should have been given, e.g., in an appendix, to make the paper more comprehensive). As usual in the field, alas, no statistical significance analysis has been performed \u2014 yet the numerical gains are large enough such that this reviewer (who has experience with those datasets) believes that the gains actually are significant (see weaknesses and questions). The presentation of the approach is solid and the paper is easy to follow."

ICLR is, as per its own definition, a venue that focuses on representation learning / deep learning. This paper is essentially a core machine learning paper, yet it does not actually cover representation learning nor deep learning. As such, I see this paper in its current form slightly out of scope for ICLR. The second concern (impact) comes from the fact that active learning has been around for quite a while (even including the crowd sourcing component as identified by the authors), and the field is somewhat saturated. The presented approach is clever and effective for a range of standard classification tasks but I wonder whether this would actually be of substantial enough interest for the ICLR audience. If the authors would link their work closer to recent applications / problems in the deep learning / representation learning field it probably would gain more attention / impact."

                        "value": "**The condition in the second paragraph of Section 3.5 is ambiguous. An indicator (j) cannot be equal to a vector (z).**\n\nThe condition is **j = argmax of the vector z** which is basically the index of the maximum element in z.\n\n**Query about the datasets.**\n\nThe datasets chosen here are a combination of datasets present in previous works in these domain (eg CEAL, ALIO, Proactive etc) which are simulated from standard UCI datasets. We have provided a summary of the datasets in table 1 due to lack of space. However we agree to more details about the individual datasets in the appendix.\n\n**Q: How were the hyper-parameters, i.e. ratio of training data, annotation budget, exploration threshold, confidence threshold, and similarity threshold, selected in the experiment?**\n\nDetermining the correct set of hyper-parameter values is a challenging task here, since we assumed\nno labelled validation set to be available. We used some heuristics to decide on the hyperpaameters. For\nexample, learning rate was decided based on looking at the convergence of the training loss,ratio of boot\nto active learning samples were decided based on the how many examples are needed to have atleast\n1 example for each class, confidence and similarity threshold were decided based on looking at the\ndistribution of the respective values. We experimented with various similarity thresholds ranging from 0.7 to 0.95 and we observed that for most of the datasets there was not much change in the performance of the classifier with varyingsimilarity threshold. This indicates that some datasets are well separated in the embedding space However we agree that these are very crude ways to determine the\nhyperparameters, therefore we decided to fix the value of the hyperparameters for all the datasets to\nshow the generalizability of these values. However if the constraint of not having any validation dataset is\nrelaxed, one can tune the hyperparameters based on the validation dataset to possibly improve the\nnumbers even further.\n\n**Q: How about the time complexity of the proposed method compared with other methods?**\n\nTime complexity wrt the no. of annotators (N) is linear because operations in KB is linear in N and the\nchange in the annotator model is also in the output layer which is linear in N.\n\n**Q: How to guarantee that the annotator model works well? If the training data is unbalanced or responses from annotators have great bias, the annotator model will fail.**\n\nWe showcase the efficacy of our annotator model empirically in figure 2 where we show the accuracy of the labels obtained from the annotator model. Many of the datasets , especially the multi class datasets such as car, ecoli etc have unbalanced distribution of labels for which our model outperforms the baseline by a large margin. However as mentioned in the reply of review 1, in the situation where most of the time, majority is incorrect, our approach will not perform optimally, which remains a drawback of not only this approach but the other baselines as well.\n\n **too small a quantity of training datasets cannot overcome the random prediction brought by the random initialization of the neural network**\n\nThis is the reason of choosing to relabel an instance with some probability at each step. For instances on which the Annotator model is not very confident, those instances will be chosen during the relabelling step and the annotator model will be trained for those instance with more label information."

In my opinion, a comparison with alternative selection strategies, such as random annotator selection, should be included. The efficacy of the sample selection strategy would be more convincingly demonstrated if the same level of accuracy could be achieved with fewer queries.\n\nQ2: In the method proposed by the article, a weighted majority scheme is employed to compute the confidence among different annotators. Numerous extant methods exist to calculate confidence, such as utilizing the L1 norm of predictions.

The goal of this framework is to best use a annotation budget to achieve the highest accuracy for a classifier. To achieve this the framework has two main components, and instance selection process and an annotator selection process.  The authors evaluate over 13 datasets (11 of which have simulated multiple annotator labels, and two that have legitimate multiple ratings). The authors show how their active learning framework out performs other similar approaches across many of the datasets (10 out of the 13)."

It also isn't clear if the improvements are statistically significant. The authors have no description of how they simulated the multiple ratings, the make passing reference to another paper. Given the importance of this detail the authors should explain how they simulated the ratings AND reference the paper. Most of the figures have a Y-axis that DOES NOT start at 0, thus inflating their improvements. In the two non-simulated datasets the proposed framework barely surpasses past approaches. For figure five and seven the authors show no baseline. How would random selection of instances and annotators performed in this case? They hand-wave that their approach works best when raters are more error prone."

We went ahead with a much difficult setting of having no labeled data to bootstrap. Even without any labeled data, we outperform CEAL in most datasets.\n\n**Q: Would this approach work in high-dimension domains, thus making the similarity function more of an issue**\n\nFor higher dimensional cases such text and images, one can use pretrained models to obtain the\nembeddings. For example for text, one might use models such as BERT to encode the text into an\nembedding vector and for images, one can use CNNs to get the embeddings. These embeddings can\nthen be passed to the similarity function\n\n**The Annotator Model makes a big assumption that the majority will be correct, can this work in cases where the majority isn't correct?**\n\nThe goal of having an annotator model which predicts annotator confidence taking in instance features as input was to help improve the labelling of an instance even when majority is not correct for that particular instance. Having said that, the way the annotator model is trained, if for most of instances, majority is incorrect, then the annotator model will be incorrectly trained and will not give optimal results. We agree that this is a drawback of the method, but all the existing methods which do not use any kind of prior information about the labellers (including having few labeled examples) also suffer from this drawback."
