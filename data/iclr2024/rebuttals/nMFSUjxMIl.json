We carefully read the comments, improved our paper, and provided detailed replies to your question as follows.\n\n> Q1: \"The dataset can be seen as an extension of CircuitNet with a few new features and labels, which can be easily obtained from the synopsis tools. For the number of designs, CircuitNet 1.0 and 2.0 both contain about 10,000 designs. According to experience, doubling the amount of data has limited improvement in prediction accuracy.\"\n\nCircuitNet 2.0 is not an extension of CircuitNet 1.0 by just increasing the number of features and labels.\nFirstly, including GPU and AI chips in CircuitNet 2.0 enables new machine learning tasks, as described in Section 4.2, compared with merely CPU designs in CircuitNet 1.0. These tasks have more realistic meanings, which probably ignites researchers to deeply think about how to devise effective ML algorithms in a realistic design environment.\nSecondly, the advanced 14nm commercial technology is harder to access even compared with 28nm technology used by CircuitNet 1.0. The open-source commercial PDKs are still 180mm [1] and 130nm [2].  The academic predictive PDK [3] lacks reliability and precision compared with commercial PDKs.\n\nTherefore, CircuitNet 2.0 is the most advanced IC design dataset,  which largely improves the foundation of ML for EDA research.\n\n[1] https://gf180mcu-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n[2] https://skywater-pdk.readthedocs.io/en/main/\n\n[3] https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/asap7\n\n> Q2: \"Prediction tasks using the dataset are not the final task for chip design tasks. In other words, the most significant tasks in EDA are decision tasks. Thus, the impact of this data set still appears to be limited.\"\n\nThe successful decision results in EDA are based on accurate estimation of target metrics, which is the common pursuit of classic methods and ML-based methods. CircuiNet 2.0 provides almost all data for decision tasks in EDA, including layout, netlist, power, and timing. For example, our dataset fully supports these recent works [1-5], which integrate ML models to help the decisions of classic optimization methods. In a word, CircuitNet 2.0 will help the community explore the boundary of decision tasks in EDA by combining classic methods and ML-based methods.\n\n[1] Jiang et al.

                        "value": "Thanks very much for your valuable feedback on our paper. We carefully read the comments, improved our paper, and provided detailed replies to your question as follows.\n\n> Q1: \"The large-scale dataset which contains more than 10000 samples is originated from only eight open-source designs, especially three smaller CPU designs. It is likely that samples from the same design share similar features.\"\n\nCPU is the most typical hardware in the realistic design environment. We list the short descriptions of these CPU designs in Table A.1, which shows the variations among CPU-type designs are still significant. Besides, we demonstrate the t-SNE results of the features of CPU designs in Figure 5, which shows a reasonable distribution for ML tasks.\n\n> Q2: \"Note that most settings in the design flow are conducted in the floorplan and powerplan stages, some combination of parameters may be unreasonable compared to those realistic industrial designs.\"\n\nThese parameter settings have been extensively verified by several experts in IC design who have been working for leading IC companies. We believe this dataset can provide a valuable foundation for ML for EDA research.\n\n> Q3: \"The t-SNE plot in section 4.2.2 is confusing. Where are the GPU and AI Chip?\"\n\nWe find the missing points of GPU and AI Chip are caused by the incompatible vector format of Figure 5 under different PDF viewers. We have changed the format of Figure 5 from vector to PNG.\n\n> Q4: \"In the transfer learning experiment, how long does it take to train 20000 iterations?\"\n\nIt takes 148 mins to train 20000 iterations with 1 A800 GPU.\n\n> Q5: \"Could the authors verify the advantage of training with multi-modal data? It seems that only graph-based input is adpoted in section 4.1.\"\n\nThank you for the comment. Recently, Wang et al. [1] have shown that fusion of multi-modal data can outperform purely graph-based or image-based methods. Our dataset provides all the data required to build such a model. As their model has not been open-source yet, we do not have enough time to conduct the experiments during the rebuttal period. We will reproduce their experiments on our dataset and release the sample code in the future. \nBesides, HybridNet [2] and Lay-Net [3] are multi-modal neural networks for congestion prediction, which also indicates the advantages of multi-modal learning in the EDA field.\n\n[1] Wang et al. \"Restructure-Tolerant Timing Prediction via Multimodal Fusion.\" 2023 60th ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC).

We carefully read the comments, improved our paper, and provided detailed replies to your question as follows.\n\n> Q1: \"The paper mentions that the current most efficient method for EDA problems ... no need to introduce ML models to every P&R stage\"\n\nThe combination of ML models and classical optimization methods is inevitable in order to achieving better outcomes in EDA design stages. Integrating ML prediction models into the classical heuristic optimization methods to help decision making has been extensively explored in the EDA community [1-4].\n\n[1] Jiang et al.

[1] integrate ML model with classical optimization methods to improve routability and timing optimization based on CircuitNet 1.0. Liu et al. [2] use GNN model to optimize the Steiner points of routing solution. Zheng et al. [3] and Liu et al. [4] use ML models to predict the routability for the optimization of placement.\n\n> Q3: \"Considering this paper targets EDA problems, can conferences such as DAC and ICCAD be a more suitable platform for publishing this paper?\"\n\nML for EDA is already a hot topic in DAC/ICCAD community and our dataset has attracted some attention. As many problems in EDA field correspond to fundamental graph and geometric problems, which are very different from current main ML applications like computer vision, social media, natural language processing, etc., and cannot be easily solved by existing ML techniques. Thus, we would like to promote this CircuitNet 2.0 dataset to a broader ML community to bring EDA problems to the attention of ML researchers, stimulate fundamental breakthroughs in ML for EDA techniques, and broaden ML applications. Therefore, we submit our dataset to the well-known ML conference, ICLR.\n\nTo achieve these goals, CircuitNet 2.0 provides user-friendly feature data generated by EDA tools. Considering the hardness of accessing EDA data, we think public realistic EDA data is valuable for the ML researchers and will build a bridge between ML community and EDA community."

All samples even originated from the same design will contain different numbers of components and nets after the synthesis and physical design stages due to various optimization steps to restructure the netlists. Note that even the physical design stage will change the circuit netlists.\n\nTo address the concern of overfitting, we perform K-fold experiments in Table 4 to show the generalization capability between samples of different designs. We can see that the model can still behave in a preferable generalization manner between different designs, which indicates the overfitting and latent negative impacts are limited.\n\n> Q2: \"This is not a severe weakness ... MLP seems to be arbitrary.\"\n\nWe compare the performance of MLP and GNN to show the importance of modeling topological relationships within netlists. Barboza et al. [1] propose an MLP for timing prediction and Guo et al. [2] use their MLP as a baseline. Our MLP is a well-tuned model similar to Guo et al. [2].\n\n[1] Barboza et al., \"Machine LearningBased Pre-Routing Timing Prediction with Reduced Pessimism.\", ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2019.\n\n[2] Guo et al. \"A Timing Engine Inspired Graph Neural Network Model for Pre-Routing Slack Prediction\", ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC), 2022.\n\n> Q3: \"typo: line 12th in section 4.3, two `introduce\u2019.\"\n\nWe have fixed it in the revision.\n\n> Q4: \"I note that the samples took a very long time to generate. What is the total generation time? How many and what kind of machines are used to generate these samples?\"\n\nOur generation flow consists of data collection, SRAM generation, verilog code integration, logic synthesis and physical design using commercial tools, manual data check, feature extraction, feature check and model-based verification. We take about 1 year to generate and verify these samples. We use one 96-core Linux server with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU @ 3.00GHz and 512 GB memory to generate these samples.\n\n> Q5: \"What about the results of congestion prediction on the training set? For example, what about the NRMSE and SSIM on CPU cases when using CPUs as training data?\"\n\nWe divide CPU designs into two sets, i.e., zero-riscy + OpenC910-1 and RISCY+RISCY-FPU, for congestion prediction as an additional experiment. The results are shown as follows. The average NRMSE is 0.0202 and SSIM is 0.8984 in the additional experiment.\n\nWhen we use CPU as the training set, the prediction results on GPU and AI chip in Table 4 are worse than those on CPU. The comparison indicates the similarity within same-type designs really exists and also further justifies the value of GPU and AI Chip to increase the diversity of our dataset.\n\nUse zero-riscy + OpenC910-1 as Train Set.\n|Test Set|NRMSE|SSIM|\n|--|--|--|\n|RISCY|0.0203|0.8989|\n|RISCY-FPU|0.0214|0.7195|\n\nUse RISCY + RISCY-FPU as Train Set.\n|Test Set|NRMSE|SSIM|\n|--|--|--|\n|zero-riscy|0.0184|0.9183|\n|OpenC910-1|0.0366|0.7195|\n\n> Q6: \"What does `details\u2019 mean in Table A.2? What are the numbers below?\"\n\nThe \u2018details\u2019 means the specific values for the settings of commercial tools. The numbers below are exactly the values for different settings. For 'Macro Setting' and 'PG Setting', different commands are used in tcl scripts, so we fill in '-'. We add '(MHz)' to the details of 'Frequency' and '(%)' to the details of 'Utilization (U)' to clarify the explanations.\n\n> Q7: \"Is the learning rate the same in transfer learning? (Figure 6)\"\n\nYes, the learning rate in transfer learning is the same as that in training from scratch, which is 2e-4, because we use Adam optimizer which has adaptive learning rate, and we find the initial learning rate setting doesn't affect the training results. We also add the clarification in Section 4.3.\n\n> Q8: \"In the experiments of congestion prediction and IR-drop prediction, models using CircuitNet 2.0 as training data have more advanced performance than those using CircuitNet. In these two experiments, what are the `unseen designs in the test set\u2019?\"\n\nThe unseen designs are chosen from \"ISPD 2015 Benchmarks with\nFence Regions and Routing Blockages for Detailed-Routing-Driven Placement.\" (https://ispd.cc/contests/15/web/benchmark.html). These designs are provided by the contest organizers and are completely different from the samples included in the CircuitNet 2.0."
