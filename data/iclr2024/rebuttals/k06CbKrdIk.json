                    "value": "The viability detection of the transplanted organs is an important biomedical issue. In organ transplantation, timelines are the most important thing. Gao19 proposed a well-designed noninvasive method evaluated the viability status of organs by detecting the variance change point of their surface temperature through exploring the entire data profile. However, most of the data in a temperature profile are redundant, which yields a waste of computational resources of their method. This paper proposes an accelerating algorithm with a well-designed dual control windows scheme that can be extended to online change detection. The proposed method significantly improves the computational speed and retains the same change detection power as the method Gao19. Simulation and application results demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed method."

Using the dual control window only speeds up the computation time by 40%, but incurs quite significant estimation bias compared to the result in Gao et al. (2019), as show in the application section.\n3. The algorithm for dual control windows is not well described and the details are a bit confusing, e.g. regarding the iterations over data profile index m and the iteration j in Algorithm 1.\n4. The test statistic \\Delta_n is shown in Gao et al. (2019) to asymptotically follow an extreme value distribution, which is how a rejection criterion can be chosen with control of the type I error. This is not included in this paper, and the proposed rejection criterion in section 2.4 could have a really high type I error."

The method presented in this paper integrated the dual control window structures into the method of Gao et al. (2019) to sufficiently narrow down the detection range of the variance change points, which significantly improved the change detection efficiency and accuracy. Although this article follows the methodological framework of Gao19, we should also emphasize that the contribution of the proposed method is valuable and sufficient. \n2. The application is an unsupervised learning environment; we cannot tell which method provided more accurate results. However, as we have motioned in this paper, our proposed algorithm discovers more earlier deteriorated change points distributed around 12 hours than Gao19. Therefore, our detection results are more consistent with the biological and biomedical conclusions. page8.\n3. I have rearranged the expression of Algorithm 1. page4;\n4. This is a very good question. We conducted additional simulation studies for type-I error, the results is updated in the Appendix-B. From Table-2, we see that the empirical sizes of the test are smaller than the levels of the test indicating that the test is a bit more conservative than expected in claiming a change point when there is no change point. The reason is that the asymptotic null distribution is a heavy-tailed extreme value distribution and may require a larger sample size to achieve the desired size of the hypothesis test.\n\nTo questions:\nThis is a very good question. My team is actually working on this direction. But it has not been done because the algorithm is more complex, and hopefully we can report this in the near future. On the other hand, we should also emphasize that the current results are already very good."

The authors assume that the signal mean is a smooth function, which makes the task more difficult. The proposed approach is a fast extension of [1] and [2]. Roughly, the authors restrict the number of candidate change-point indexes of the original method.\n\nThe original method simultaneously estimates the smooth mean function and the potential variance change-point index. The proposed algorithm splits the two operations. In addition, the authors introduce two \"control windows\": one limits the number of indexes on which change detection is performed, and the other limits the number of indexes on which the mean estimation is performed.\n\n[1] Zhenguo Gao, Zuofeng Shang, Pang Du & John L.

I cannot tell if this improvement is significant as I am unfamiliar with this application. If 30 minutes is an acceptable execution time, could it be obtained by simply parallelizing the current algorithm? Since each pixel of the thermal video is processed independently, a 3x or 4x speed-up is expected on a personal laptop.\n\n- It is not clear to me if the variance change point detection procedure (Section 2.4) is a contribution of this work. Can you clarify?\n\n- The new algorithm seems more accurate because the candidate change points are restricted to a window. This can prevent false detection on the edges of the signal. How is your method better than a post-processing of the change-points of Gao19 (e.g., by computing a window on the results of Gao19)? \n\nMinor comments:\n- In the title: \"An Effective Variance Change Detection Method under Constantly Changing Mean\".\n- L124: \"Large sample size will slow down the computational speed.\" This statement is vague. You could provide the computational complexity, for instance.\n- How are the initial change-points estimated at the beginning of the algorithm (Step 1)?\n- \"Equation 1\" instead of \"equation 1\".\n- typo L251\n- typo L178\n- typo L113\n- typo L116-117\n- More typos."

As mentioned in the first paragraph of this paper, in an organ transplantation operation, both doctors and patients are racing against time. Even 30 seconds is a luxury, not to mention 30 minutes. If we run our proposed method and Gao19 method together on the same computer, ours is constantly faster than Gao 19.  \n2. The variance change point detection procedure is the step-A of our proposed algorithm, page4;\n3. The method presented in this paper integrated the dual control window structures into the method of Gao et al. (2019). The proposed method sufficiently narrowed down the detection range of the variance change points, which significantly improved the change detection efficiency and accuracy. \n\nTo minor comments:\n1. revised;\n2. revised and marked in blue, page4;\n3. revised and marked in blue, second paragraph on page3;\n4. revised;\n5-9: revised."
