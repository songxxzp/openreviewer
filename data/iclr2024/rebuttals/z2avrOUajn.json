                        "value": "Dear Reviewer tXm3,\n\nThanks for your careful reading and feedback. We are really appreciated and well encouraged for your recognition of our work.\n\n**W1. Frequency-based subgraph extractor.** \n\nActually, we haven\u2019t claimed that we propose a new frequency-based subgraph extractor, but just implement the subgraph extractor by MiCaM[1] (have cited in manuscript). The aim of our research is to achieve unified and interpretable graph diffusion generation but not the subgraph extraction. Therefore, our extractor is directly realized by existing support method.\n\n**W2. The setting of $ {\\mu _i}$.** \n\nIn our insights, we should maintain the semantic consistency between the facts of graph properties and latent representation space, and graph properties are considered as the supervision signal in our implementation. Thus, the assumption of the latent embeddings actually comes from the physical facts.\n\nSpecifically, the setting of $ {\\mu _i}$ is to control the \u2018distance\u2019 between sample representations with property value $y_i$ . In our implementations, since the six properties we use are all evolving continuous variables, we map the range of property values to $k=[1,2]$ and constrain the corresponding sample latent representation by ${\\mu _i} = k\\mathbf{I} \\in [\\mathbf{I},2\\mathbf{I}]$ where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the unit matrix.\n\nI guess that you are confused about why $ {\\mu _i} \\in [I,2I]$ is used as the priori instead of $[0,I]$. We experimentally explored this problem in the early stages of our research, and now show empirical results on QM9 as below. In most evaluation metrics, different settings can achieve similar overall performance, but $[0,I]$'s design is obviously more unstable. \n\n|      | Atom Sta (% ) | Mol Sta (% ) |  Valid (% )  | Valid & Unique (% )|\n|   :--:   | :--:   | :--:   |  :--: | :--: |\n| SubDiff($[0,I]$) |  97.8 \u00b1 1.2   |   89.9 \u00b1 1.6  |  91.4 \u00b1 1.2  |  89.2 \u00b1 1.9  |\n| SubDiff($[I,2I]$) |  98.9 \u00b1 0.1   |   91.1 \u00b1 0.8  |  94.2 \u00b1 0.3  |  91.4 \u00b1 0.4  |\n\nWe make the following hypothesis based on above results. Note that the goal of noising is $z_{{G_S}}^{(T)} \\sim N(0,I)$. If $ [0,I]$ is set, the noising process of all samples from $ z_{{G_S}}^{(0)}$ to $z_{{G_S}}^{(T)}$ is equivalent to trapping all samples close to those samples with ${\\mu _i} = 0$. Such process makes the diffusion (noise adding) process becomes biased and will greatly reduce the diversity of generated samples. Therefore, we directly preset ${\\mu _i} \\in [I,2I]$ as a priori. \n\nHowever, the above analysis is just derived from the hypotheses of empirical results. Thus it still has not discussed in our manuscript. Maybe it will be further studied in the future with both empirical and theoretical support.\n\n**W3. Sampling process.** \n\n**Insights and solution overview. ** The graph diffusion process aims to construct distribution from training samples, and generate new graphs by sampling from constructed distribution. In our work, we establish two distributions as the separated sampling beginning heads to unify the conditional and unconditional generation task. We argue that different distributions can be controlled by different sampling beginnings, which result in various generated contents. Therefore, we let the beginning distribution of conditional generation with supervision ($ H_C $) while unconditional generation sample from pure Gaussian distribution ($ H_U $).\n\nTo be specific, we propose the \u2018Head Alterable Sampling\u2019 strategy, where \u2018Head Alterable\u2019 refers to the adjustable beginning (position), where it has been described in Sec. 5.2 and Fig. 1(c). We further show their respective generation (sampling) paths:\n\n${H_U}:z_{{G_S}}^{(T)} -  -  > \\hat z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > G$\n\n${H_C}:z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > z_{{G_S}}^{(T)} -  -  > \\hat z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > G$\n\n\nwhere $z_{{G_S}}^{(0)}$ ~ $N({\\mu _i},I)$ and ${\\mu _i}$ is pre-designed based on the characteristics of our focused properties as shown in Table 4.\n\n\n**W4. Ablation Study.** \n\nSince the subgraph extractor is a sub-core part, we take MiCaM as the subgraph extractor, which is able to guarantee the veracity and sufficiency of extracted subgraphs. In fact, the authors of MiCaM [1] have shown a performance comparison with BRICS [2], and MiCaM obtained better performance.\n\n\n**W5. Minor concerns.** \n\nAll neural networks used for the encoder, latent diffusion, and decoder, including ${E_\\theta }$ and $ {D_\\xi }$, are implemented with SE-GNN. In SE-GNN, ${L^1}$ and ${L^2}$ are both basic backbones of GNNs to encode graph data, which is implemented by GIN. $ pooling $ is MEAN operation in our work."

                        "value": "**Q1. Proposition 1.** \n\nProposition 1 indicates that we support the perspective that the generative model inductively learns the distribution space of training samples, and samples from this space to achieve specific generative tasks [3, 4]. Specifically, unconditional generation (Un-G) focuses on the wideness of the sampling space to enable diversity, while conditional generation (Con-G) focuses on the bounds of specific properties in the sampling space. In essence, Con-G sample space is a certain subset (cluster) of Un-G space.\n\nActually, for almost all previous graph generative models [5, 6, 7], the unconditional model can be extended to conditional version with additional training. In contrast, our work is to unify the separated training schemes on conditional/unconditional generation into once training paradigm. The superiority of such once training can fully exploit the existing samples for comprehensive understanding, which not only enhances the quality of conditional generation but also improves the efficiency of conditional-unconditional learning.\n\n**Q2. Writing issue in Alg. 1.**\n\nThanks again for your careful review! The $x^{(t)}$ in the training phase should be written as $z_{{G_S}}^{(t)}$. We will thoroughly check the spelling and grammar issues in this manuscript. \n\nYour comments are very professional and insightful, which give us a deeper understanding to improve our work. Many of your observations also inspired our future work. We will incorporate these results and additional discussions in our revised submission. Thanks again!

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer C6xG,\n\nWe are very grateful to receive your positive feedback. Many thanks! We have carefully addressed your professional and insightful comments as below. \n\n**W1. The motivation of this work.**\n\nThere is a consensus that studying complex dependencies in graph data is a major challenge for graph generation tasks[1, 2]. The most direct idea (solution) is to shield complex semantic association in graph, thus we naturally obtain the first research motivation, i.e., using subgraphs as generated elements (units). Specifically, the reason for using subgraphs as latent representation elements is that we have the following insights:\n\n- Given that whole graphs are with substantial and complex dependencies across numerous nodes, subgraph-level modeling can simplify most connections between nodes, and alleviate the challenges posed by complex dependencies in graphs.\n\n- Subgraphs can determine the property of the whole graph, such as functional groups can indicate the property of molecules. Taking subgraph as the minimum unit in graph diffusion process can enable an interpretable generative process for various science domains.\n\nSubsequently, the great success of latent (stable) diffusion model inspired us to propose the subgraph latent diffusion model. More importantly, subgraph-based diffusion generation pattern remains unexplored so far. Along this line of thinking, we conducted research on Subgraph Diffusion by proposing SubDiff. \n\n\n**W2. Subgraph-level generation paradigm and unified model.**\n\nAs we discussed in Sec. 1, subgraph-level design not only provides a more interpretable generation process, but also empowers a great potential to integrate condition into unconditional models. Specifically, we argue that there is no stable causal (interpretable) relationship from nodes to graph properties. But for subgraphs, it has been proven that key subgraphs can potentially determine graph properties [3, 4]. Constraining strong prior hypothesis cannot facilitate the model to kill two birds with one stone, even may lead to inferior performance. Therefore, we take subgraph as a bridge to unify conditional-unconditional generation. \n\nIn addition, we design node-level diffusion model NodeDiff (Sec. 6.3) to empirically answer whether node-level diffusion can also achieve a unified model with superior performance. We observe a  significant drop over performances, where it  even becomes weaker than the non-uniform node-level diffusion model (GEOLDM [1]).\n\n\n**W3. Missed related works.**\n\nAs one of early works on graph latent diffusion models, NVDiff generates novel and realistic graphs by taking the VGAE structure and uses SGM as its prior for latent node vectors. More important, this work proven that the latent graph diffusion model has a proper lower-bound of the graph likelihood. NVDiff will be discussed in our manuscript.\n\nThanks again for your constructive comments, and we will continue to improve our manuscript.

                    "value": "1.\tThe authors first propose that the discrete geometric property of graphs makes it difficult to capture complex node-level dependencies for diffusion models. They claim that this problem can be solved by using subgraphs, which they present as the main contribution of this paper. I disagree with this viewpoint. Firstly, the existence of complex node-level dependencies has nothing to do with whether the data is discrete or continuous. Whether it is discrete atomic features or continuous positional features, complex node-level dependencies still exist. Secondly, while abstracting multiple nodes into subgraphs eliminates node dependencies, there can still be dependencies between subgraphs. However, the paper does not propose a solution for this subgraph dependency issue.\n2.\tThe authors' second contribution is the proposal that subgraph latent embedding with explicit supervision can bridge the gap between unconditional and conditional generation. However, the explicit supervision used in the paper is graph-level label, and I do not get the contribution of subgraph latent embedding. In other words, the proposed solution in the paper, such as pooling subgraph latent embedding as in Eq. 7, could be replaced by pooling node latent embedding to obtain graph latent embedding. I doubt the necessity of using subgraph latent embedding to bridge the gap between unconditional and conditional generation.\n3.\tThe description of the methods proposed in the paper is not clear enough. Two methods are proposed in the paper: subgraph-level equivariant architecture (SE-GNN) and head-alterable sampling strategy. Firstly, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how to implement L1 and L2 in SE-GNN. Secondly, in Section 4.2, the authors do not explain why it is called head-alterable, and it is not clear why this is considered a sampling strategy. From the beginning of page 6, this method changes the mean of the Gaussian distribution during the training phase. Additionally, the paper does not explain how to personalize the prior distribution for each property $y_i$, some equations to be presented.\n4.\tSome recent related works need to be compared, such as MDM [1].\n\n[1] Huang, Lei, et al. \"Mdm: Molecular diffusion model for 3d molecule generation.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer Dfq7,\n\nThanks for your valuable comments to further improve our manuscript! Here we carefully address your concerns as follows.\n\n**W1. The explanation of the discrete geometry and subgraph-level dependencies.**\n\nActually, the discreteness of graph refers to the characteristics of non-Euclidean geometry, while another opposite aspect is grid-based data which is associated with Euclidean geometry [1, 2, 3]. Thus, the discrete geometry here doesn\u2019t indicate the discreteness or continuousness of numerical values. In our research, we specially investigate the diffusion process in the space of non-Euclidean geometry, and propose to take the advantage of subgraph learning to reduce the complexity of node-level dependencies along diffusion process.\n\nFor the question of how to infer the subgraph-level dependencies, we dedicatedly design a SE-GNN in Sec 4.1 to aware the dependencies among subgraphs by maintaining the equivalence across them ((${L^2}$ component of SE-GNN ).\n\n\n**W2. Why the subgraph-level design makes sense?**\n\nThe reason for using subgraphs as latent representation elements is that we have the following insights:\n\n- Given that whole graphs are with substantial and complex dependencies across numerous nodes, subgraph-level modeling can simplify most connections between nodes, and alleviate the challenges posed by complex dependencies in graphs.\n\n- Subgraphs can determine the property of the whole graph, such as functional groups can indicate the property of molecules. Taking subgraph as a minimum unit in graph diffusion process can enable an interpretable generative process for various science domains.\n\nActually, since our generation task is to obtain graphs with desired properties, the explicit supervision in the work is exactly on graph-level labels. Overall, the contribution of subgraph latent embedding is to disentangle the complex dependencies in whole graphs and enable the interpretability for generative process.\n\n**W3. The explanation of SE-GNN and HAS.**\n\n**Insights and solution overview.** The graph diffusion process aims to construct distribution from training samples, and generates new graphs by sampling from constructed distribution. In our work, we establish two distributions as the separated sampling beginning heads to unify the conditional and unconditional generation task. We argue that different distributions can be controlled by different sampling beginnings, which results in various generated contents. In our work, we let the beginning distribution of conditional generation with supervision ($ H_C $) while unconditional generation sample from pure Gaussian distribution ($ H_U $).\nConcretely,\n\n- ${L^1}$ and ${L^2}$ are both basic backbones of GNNs to encode graph data, which is implemented by GIN in our work.\n\n- Based on above **Insights and solution overview**, we propose the \u2018Head Alterable Sampling\u2019 strategy, where \u2018Head Alterable\u2019 refers to the adjustable beginning (position), and it has been described in Sec. 5.2 and Fig. 1(c). We further show their generation (sampling) paths respectively:\n\n${H_U}:z_{{G_S}}^{(T)} -  -  > \\hat z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > G$\n\n${H_C}:z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > z_{{G_S}}^{(T)} -  -  > \\hat z_{{G_S}}^{(0)} -  -  > G$\n\n\nwhere $z_{{G_S}}^{(0)}$ ~ $N({\\mu _i},I)$ and ${\\mu _i}$ is pre-designed based on the characteristics of our focused properties as shown in Table 4.\n\nThanks for your suggestion and we will incorporate these insights and description of our method into our manuscript.\n \n**W4. Missed related works.**\n\nThank you for reminds. As a classic discrete graph diffusion model on molecule generation tasks, we will discuss Mdm [4] in detail in our manuscript.\n\nYour comments are constructive to our work.

But we still would like to provide some necessary clarifications as follows. \n\n-\tFirst, actually, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our motivation, our main experiments have focused on the subgraph-level graph representation learning, and have compared with non-subgraph-level approaches (e.g., GEOLDM). Besides, we have also degenerated SubDiff to a node-level latent diffusion model NodeDiff and make a necessary ablative comparison. Therefore, we believe that the experimental analysis of the advantages of subgraphs is sufficient. \n\n-\tSecondly, we have responded/made clarifications to all questions and concerns you raised, but we have not got any interaction or feedback from any of the reviewers until now. Thus, we are unsure whether your concerns have been adequately addressed. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t remain the opportunity to revise the paper. If the concerns have been addressed (or accepted), we will certainly make revisions in the next version based on suggestions of all reviewers accordingly. \n\n-\tLast, in your previous reviews, you have not mentioned any additional experiments. In fact, based on the suggestions of Reviewer tXm3, we have already added some additional results about the setting of $ {\\mu _i}$. Please refer to our revised submission.\n\nFinally, we are going to submit a revised version of this manuscript, and sincerely hope that the reviewers can provide an opportunity to consider our work in the next round of discussion period. \n\nThanks again!"
