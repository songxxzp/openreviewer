Two novel metrics, the Average coefficient norm, and Normalized loss, were presented to quantify the sparsity of embedding layers.\n\nThe activation distributions of three classes of transformer language models were analyzed. It was discovered that all layers are sparse and that embedding layers are more sparse in the first and last layers."

                    "value": "The paper's introduction of two novel sparsity metrics is undermined by inadequate justification for their necessity and a deviation from established interpretations of \"ground truth\" in sparse activity, challenging the validity of the results. Additionally, the study's reliance on a limited range of datasets and a lack of depth in analysis, particularly in the comparison of large language models' embedding layers to Gaussian models, restricts the generalizability and meaningfulness of the findings. Expanding dataset diversity and deepening the analysis could significantly enhance the paper's contribution to sparsity metrics."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "The main contribution of the paper revolves around two novel sparsity metrics \u2014 Normalized loss and Average coefficient. However, the justification for their effectiveness as sparsity metrics remains inadequate.\n\nA primary concern is the definition of \u201cground truth\u201d in the appendix. It suggests that since each active feature is weighted by a factor uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, the expected weighted number of active features is a/2, and thus, this is considered the \u201ccorrect\u201d value for the metric. This approach conflicts with the standard definition of sparse activity in datasets and seems more akin to an average coefficient value. Moreover, it contradicts the criteria for a good sparsity metric stated in Section 3, which emphasizes that a meaningful sparsity metric should remain invariant under uniform scaling of all activations. While the proposed metrics themselves are invariant, scaling the \u201ccorrect\u201d value by 1/2 due to coefficient distribution contradicts this criterion.\n\nIf the \u201cGround Truth\u201d line were adjusted to a, the comparative analysis would differ significantly, potentially showing the Average Coefficient metric as closer to the Ground Truth than the newly proposed metrics. For clarity, this unconventional definition of Ground Truth should be highlighted in the figure caption or the main body, rather than relegated to the appendix.\n\nAdditionally, for a novel metric, a broader range of datasets for benchmarking would have been beneficial to demonstrate its applicability.\n\nFurthermore, the conclusion drawn about the higher sparsity of LLMs embedding layers compared to Gaussian models is limited in its meaningfulness. The study could have been strengthened by incorporating a more diverse set of benchmarks and control comparisons, such as analyzing results across various corpora beyond Wikipedia abstracts, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed metrics."

If we can evaluate that assumption, I believe that it would really validate the dictionary learning approach to interpretability, whereas if we can't validate the assumption, our trust in these approaches is limited. I fully believe the hypothesis that LMs involve sparse activation features myself, though I don't have empirical evidence for that."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "My primary issue with this paper is that I'm not convinced that the metrics actually are accurate or meaningful in highly underparameterized settings. This is important because the under parameterized setting is the motivation for the superposition hypothesis. As far as I could tell, the only results that directly confront this are in fig 7. For the embedding size 64, the metrics are highly inaccurate after 32 and for embedding size 512, accuracy falls off before 128. To me, this suggests that the metrics are inaccurate for the main settings we are interested in: under parameterized settings with more distributed features than parameters.\n\nA related issue is that some of these features are likely to be correlated while others are likely to be uncorrelated in practice. That introduces a huge difference between the synthetic and real models. I'm unconvinced by these synthetic experiments. Therefore, I'm unconvinced that the metrics applied to the natural language setting can be trusted, which unfortunately invalidates the other results in the paper.\n\nMinor/citations:\n- There is very little reference to the existing work in sparsity and language models. In general, the interpretability literature review appears to be almost entirely image classification work, prior to 2020. There is a very long history of interpretability in NLP, and much of it involves assumptions of sparsity. I recommend reading https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08951 for an overview, to better engage with the literature in the area, though it only covers up to 2018. \n- One topic of discussion in older interpretability literature is whether sparse representations are actually more interpretable. This is taken as an assumption here, but it has been subject to debate for a long time\nhttps://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.17/\nhttps://begab.github.io/interpretability-of-sparse-reps"
