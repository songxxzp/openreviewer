                    "value": "This paper investigates to what extent clustering of latent representations in pre-trained classifiers can be used to address problems such as few-shot learning, unsupervised domain adaptation and continual learning. The motivation is to provide a simple, competitive baseline that involves no fine-tuning that allows for interpretable results (e.g. via visualisation of nearest prototypes in a cluster for a given query). The approach involves extracting the pre-trained features of a new dataset, performing unsupervised clustering and then post-processing the clustering results to make predictions, in different ways depending on the type of task. The experiments use SWAG-ViT models for the pre-trained representations. It is shown that on some coarse-grained tasks (e.g. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) their unsupervised method is competitive with a purpose-trained supervised ResNet, but weaker on fine-grained tasks. Results are also shown for few-shot learning for the same tasks, showing improved performance. Results are also shown for a continual learning setup, where it is shown to outperform one gradient-based continual learning method (itaml) on incremental CIFAR tasks, and also an unsupervised domain adaptation setup, where it is shown to outperform the method from Peng 2019 on DomainNet. Finally, some examples of retrieved prototypes are visualised in the context of the unsupervised domain adaptation experiments, that demonstrate some failure modes of the method."

Instead of focusing on semi- and unsupervised learning through representation learning, the authors suggest analyzing the feature spaces of existing foundational models. Their research demonstrates that by using non-parametric clustering of these latent feature spaces and utilizing pre-trained classifiers on large datasets, many challenges can be addressed without the need for fine-tuning. The authors propose leveraging the latent spaces of classifiers, like SWAG-ViT, that have been trained on vast datasets. This approach can manage continuously evolving data streams in both unsupervised and semi-supervised contexts. Moreover, it offers interpretability by using prototypes. The authors provide a set of experiments in various settings to showcase the performance of the method."

This technique has been explored and refined in various forms over recent years, as evidenced by key works like Caron et al. (2018), Ji et al. (2019), and Caron et al. (2021). The authors appear to overlook these seminal papers, and the distinctions between their approach and the methods in these references seem subtle at best.\n\n- The paper covers a broad spectrum of topics, which, while ambitious, seems to dilute its core contribution to a specific application. While it showcases results across multiple settings, the outcomes appear to lack a distinct scenario where the method demonstrates superior performance. The related work section and the experimental section, would benefit from . \n\n- The baselines used in the domain-specific experiments appears to be less than ideal. If one of the main claims is that the proposed method is competitive with fine-tuning, then it is necessary to substantiate this claim empirically. In the few-shot learning segment, a comparison with SOTA fine-tuning techniques (like Bit, Kolesnikov et al. 2020) is needed. Additionally, it would be pertinent to compare with clustering techniques, specifically those presented in Caron et al. 2018 and Ji et al. (2019). The continual learning section should also benchmark against robust fine-tuning baselines, such as the one recently presented in Panos et al. (2023).\n\nReferences\n-----------\n\nCaron, M., Bojanowski, P., Joulin, A., & Douze, M. (2018). Deep clustering for unsupervised learning of visual features.

                    "value": "The writing of the paper leaves much to be desired, specifically the contributions. Ironically the contributions that the authors claim are listed in bullet points in the introduction. As a reader, it is hard to tell what exactly is newly proposed by the authors and what are existing methods or settings. For example, the two algorithms in page 4 would seem to be novel contributions by the authors but according to Section 3.1.1 it seems like these are mere exact descriptions of existing clustering methods. \n\nThe experiment section is also quite confusing. There are many diverse tasks listed which might seem like a good thing. However, it is unclear what the exact setting is, what the baselines are, and how these results relate to the main claim. For example, in section 4.2 the author directly jumps into one step of what seems like their method. However, there is no context of the purpose of the experiment and how to understand the results. The figures are even worse which will be elaborated in the questions section.\n\nOverall, the paper is far from the acceptance threshold. The authors should really consider what claims to make and how to support them with theoretical or empirical evidence."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "The authors motivate the need for unsupervised clustering by suggesting the semantic-rich latent space could be utilized for downstream tasks without altering the pretrained model (P1, \"The proposed analysis suggests that with a generic enough feature space one could perform continual learning using only shallow learning techniques, such as clustering, within the pre-trained latent spaces without finetuning.\"). Well, as a matter of fact, people do actually do that. One could easily add an additional classification head (or modules of other purpose) and freeze the pretrained model to serve as a feature extractor. The authors should compare with these lightweight, supervised baselines.\n\nThe purpose of the related works section is to contexualize how this work compares to other existing related works. However, the related works section this paper dedicates a small paragraph to \"explain\" each terminology and provide one or two representative existing works. There is no indication of how these existing works relate to this paper. This exacerbates the difficulty of understanding what exactly are the contributions of this work.\n\nFigures are supposed to help readers understand the results more intuitively. The figures in this work unfortunately don't serve this purpose. For example, Fig 4 shows the results of each individual run separately in a figure (as opposed to presenting the mean with variance) and different methods in different subfigures. This makes it immensely difficult to compare between different methods. Also, it seems like the finetuned variants perform significantly better than the no-finetune clustering counterparts, which does not support the authors claim. Another example is Fig 5 where the retrieve related samples are suppose to serve as prototypes for interpreting model error. The figure is extremely difficult to understand and even after attempting to grasp what is presented, it fails to make the model more interpretable."
