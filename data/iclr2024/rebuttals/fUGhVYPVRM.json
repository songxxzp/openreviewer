The core idea of the proposed method, called AWP, is to distinguish different alignment paths by prioritizing the one exhibiting the better property using an additional loss term. To promote such properties, simple rule-based strategies are employed to modify the alignment. For example, one may shift 1 token to generate a \u2018worse\u2019 (delayed) alignment path. Experiments conducted on online/offline ASR models show that AWP can boost the desired properties compared to previous baselines."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback, which assisted us clarify some aspects of the work and update the text accordingly. We value the acknowledgement of the strengths of our work, in particularly its thorough comparison to previous work and its generality. In the following, we did our best to address every concern or question raised by the reviewer.\n\n**Strengthening table 2 by adding more experiments with an online Conformer**\n\nTable 2 presents an extensive research, to allow the different methods to work under the same settings as AWP, and we thank the reviewer for acknowledging it as a strength of the paper. The wide array of experiments conducted with a Conformer weren\u2019t fully matured by the ICLR deadline. However, we enhanced table 2 by adding an online Conformer with AWP and updated the text accordingly. We kindly refer the reviewer for the \u2018common response\u2019 part for the details. \n\n**While the latency reduction part presents extensive experimental results, there are fewer results on minimum WER training, and their gain is marginal.**\n\nThe evidence for the successful application of AWP to the low latency application is stronger and wider. Yet, although more modest, the WER part presents 2 model architectures, and another method for optimizing mWER was added to table 3 for additional reference (see the \u2018common response\u2019 part). The gain in this part is moderate compared to prior work.  Graves & Jaitly, 2014 reported a relative improvement ranging from 3.7% to 9% on the Wall Street Journal dataset. Prabhavalkar et al,. 2018 reported an improvement ranging between 4.1% to 7.4%, and [1] reported a 5% improvement, both on non-public datasets. We believe that although the gains for the latency application are more prominent than the WER application, the relative improvement in the WER application demonstrates the versatility and the generality of AWP.\n\n**Can results be improved by increasing the number of shifted frames (tokens), or by applying AWP together with Trim-Tail, for example?**\n\nAs demonstrated in table 2, AWP achieves better results than the other methods both in latency and in accuracy, including reaching a negative DL. Increasing the number of shifted frames yielded a similar trend, but our empirical findings suggest that gradual changes were favored. We added appendix C to discuss the variations of the property function, we kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019. \nExploring the combination of AWP with other methods like Trim-Tail can be very promising. However, it can be expected that the trade off between latency and accuracy may still play an important role, as decreasing the latency even further is expected to increase the WER.\n\n**WSR is figured 6 and 7**\n\nWSR is the word success rate, 100-WER. We modified figure 6 to present WER, and changed the caption of figure 7.\n\n**How many alignments (N) do you sample for each step? How does AWP affect the overall training time/resource usage?**\n \nWe thank the reviewer for the question, we added this information to appendix A. Under the low latency setting, we set N=5 and for the WER setting we set N=10, based on empirical observations. \nAs mentioned, sampling occurs every training step, and training with AWP is, empirically, 2-3 times slower than training a baseline model.\n\n[1]  M.

Why WER and not CER as language model could fix the errors? Is language model used in this process?\n- I believe that sampling alignments is not the right / optimal way: we could consider optimization of the top-N alignments instead, as otherwise we spend time on optimization low probability alignments. \n- A bunch of models in Table 2 (on latency empirical results) are not comparable: either latency should be fixed and WER is compared or vice versa. Right now it is hard to make any conclusions from Table 1 due to different values for latency and WER of different models.\n- Results in Table 3 are within std on Librispeech as 0.1 variation is normal between different models often for clean part of test set. Also it is not clear if improvement is consistent for both greedy and LM decoding or only for the latter one.

If multilingual, why not English only as then another confound factor is introduced?\n- I would suggest to report results with both greedy decoding and language model, also report both clean and noisy LibriSpeech as a lot of effects are not visible on clean anymore.\n- Throughout the text it is not clear where LM is used or not in the reported numbers.\n- Seems in Table 2 performance of conformer model is not so good as in the prior paper (3.7 vs 2.0), or check Squeezeformer baselines.\n- What is WSR abbreviation (I could not find this notation in the text)? Figure 6 is hard to parse in the current form.\n- Why are multilingual wav2vec used for experiments? why not English only?\n- I found it surprising that Gumbel softmax with temperature is similar to the standard sampling. Some discussion would be helpful on this topic in the main body, as seems we are very limited with potential improvements if we manipulate with alignments weights.\n- what is the relation between Table 2 and Table 4 for the prior methods?

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback. We did our best to address the concerns raised by the reviewer.\n\n**Absence of comparison with prior works**\n\nFor the latency application, we\u2019ve conducted an extensive comparison to prior works. To ensure a fair comparison, we implemented or adjusted public code to fit our setting. Additionally, we enhanced the text with an additional mWER optimization for comparison, we kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019 for details.\n\n**complexity of hyper-parameters**\n\nThis work introduces three additional hyperparameters: $\\lambda$ and $\\alpha$, standard in the context of hinge loss and additional loss term, and start-epoch. Our rationale for the latter is detailed in the 'common response'.\n\n**Missing details on the implementation. Why WER and not CER? Is language model (LM) used?**\nWe optimize WER rather than CER as WER is the primary metric for evaluating ASR systems. Furthermore, CTC is more closely related to CER than WER, given its indifference to whether errors are localized within a single word or distributed across multiple words (see fig 2.b in the text). In response to the reviewer\u2019s comment, we added the code for WER optimization to the supplementary material. Concerning the LM, our implementation uses an LM in the beam search decoding (we kindly refer the review to appendix A1).\n\n**Sampling vs. top-N alignments**\n\nEmpirically, we found no evidence in favour of top-N alignments. We elaborated on this issue in the \u2018common response\u2019, we kindly refer the reviewer to this section.\n\n**Comparing models in table 2**\n\nEach of the top 2 sections in table 2, along with the Conformer section, exhibit comparability. It presents an offline model, an online model and an online model + AWP, and shows clear trend: the offline model is superior in terms of WER but also has the highest TL, the online model improves the TL on the expense of WER, and the online + AWP improves the TL even further in the cost of a WER. \nThe third section presents these 3 models, alongside additional losses or input manipulation. We can see that AWP performs better in both DL and WER.\n\n**Results in table 3 are within std on Librispeech. Report results on Greedy Decoding.**\n\nAlthough not reported, we repeated all experiments with several seeds. Based on this, we found that our results are exceeding 1 std. We didn\u2019t want to overload the paper with results, therefore we reported after beam search decoding, which is not unusual in the area of mWER optimization.\n\n**I found it overall hard to formulate the proper reweighing between different alignments, rather than simple way of controlling the latency by restricting context or optimising directly mWER. Reported results are marginal.**\n\nWe will endeavor to respond to the best of our understanding. AWP only requires a definition of a property function, which given an alignment, yields an improved alignment w.r.t to the property. Thus, it does not explicitly mandate the user to formulate a reweighting scheme. As for the advantages of AWP over alternatives - We discuss in the paper that context restriction allows control of the latency, but it also results in a drift (DL) in the online model. With AWP we were able to reduce this drift at the expense of WER. In table 2 we show that AWP can have a negative drift. Overall, we present compelling evidence that AWP can be successfully applied to low latency applications across, and yield moderate gains in WER optimization.\n\n**CTC posteriors**\n\nWe agree, text was updated accordingly.\n\n**Shifting several tokens**\n\nWe kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018general response\u2019 part, where we elaborated on variations of the property function.\n\n**35K hours curated from LibriVox**\n\nEnglish only.\n\n**LM usage**\n\nLM is used for decoding. We provide details in Appendix A1.\n\n**Conformer Performance**\n\nWe use a different decoder and a different LM than the ones used in the Conformer paper. This could explain the difference. We kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019 for details on the Conformer.\n\n**WSR**\n\nWSR is the word success rate. Figure 6 now shows WER.\n\n**multilingual w2v**\n\nWe aimed for the base size model, and as far as we know, this model was trained on the largest training set for such a model.\n\n**Gumbel softmax (GS)**\n\nWe show that sampling and GS yields similar results. Since softmax is applied to the CTC matrix, the derivatives of the hinge loss affects all the entries, and not just the entries correspond to the sampled alignment, which can explain the effectiveness of the sampling method.\n\n**The relation between Tables 2 and 4**\n\nBoth present other applications to mitigate the DL. To compare table 4 to AWP, we see that AWP achieves the best working point in terms of both DL and WER. Other approaches may yield better WER or latency, but not simultaneously both.\n\n**32ms window, stride of 16ms**\n\n It is optimized for STFT that works in multiples of 2."

I think, more valuable to show results will be to fix latency for all models in the same group and show what WER can be achieved. Otherwise, yep, we know that there is the trade off between latency and WER. If you could show that for the significantly improved latency the WER doesn't change or better than prior works which have worse latency (so your degradation of WER for better latency is lower than in prior works) -- this is \"no question\" result and contribution for me. With the current numbers I still cannot say why your method will be preferable, as I could decrease model size, or restrict look ahead, etc. to improve latency and get worse WER too. I believe your method is very practical and it is just a lack of proper comparison which must strengthen the paper significantly. \n\nThis is the main concern for me for the paper acceptance."

                    "value": "- For the minimum word error rate application, there has been a number of work in optimizing it in a discriminative sequence training setting for ASR, e.g. MBR training, large margin training, etc. The proposed framework should be compared to those stronger baselines instead. Right now it is only compared to the weaker vanilla MLE baseline with some modest improvement. In particular, if the property function is to generate the ground truth alignment, instead of only allowing reducing 1 word error, then it should be closer to the traditional discriminative sequence training setup.\n- For the minimum word error rate application, Prabhavalkar et al. 2018 found that using the n-best beam search hypotheses is more effective than the sampling-based approach. This paper should do a similar comparison whether it should compute the property function in the n-best alignments instead of sampled alignments.\n- Latency and WER optimizations typically compete with each other. It would be great to utilize the proposed framework to optimize these two properties jointly with a single property function to see if they can be balanced better together, and also see how effective and generalizable the framework is.\n- How sensitive is the optimization to the specific choice of the property function? E.g. the currently designed latency function only allows one time step faster, and property function for the minimum WER application only allows one word error reduction. Are these choices made in order to stabilize the training, or actually they can be relaxed to allow more changes as well? The paper should compare more different property function choices for the same specific application.\n- For the latency application, another intuitive approach would be to sample an alignment corresponding to the ground truth label sequence, and then the property function would be to run a force aligner to get the more accurate time alignment for the label sequence. How would this compare to the current proposed approach?\n- Adding the latency optimization to an offline Conformer model doesn't make much sense, since the full-context model is not used in a streaming fashion and it has to wait for the entire sentence to come first, which by itself already has a much higher latency. Conformer can be implemented in a streaming manner as well by just using the left context, which can be optimized for edge devices as well. The latency experiment should be conducted on an online Conformer.\n- Using \"start epoch\" as a tunable hyperparameter to control the balance between latency and quality is a bit strange. How transferable is the optimal start epoch to different learning schedule, model architectures and data?"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback, which assisted us clarify some aspects of the work and update the text accordingly. We are particularly thankful for the recognition of the strengths of our work. In the following, we did our best to address the comments and the concerns raised by the reviewer. \n\n**Comparison to discriminative sequence training (DST)**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the comment. The focus of this work is CTC, and thus we focused on comparing AWP to other optimizations that are suitable for CTC. As noted by reviewer 4pZf, we conducted an extensive comparison in the latency application. For the WER application, to the best of our knowledge, there is a limited body of work on DST with CTC. Graves & Jaitly, 2014 is one example, yet, it required extensive optimization. Thus, we adapted another approach by Prabhavalkar et al,. 2018 to work in a CTC setting. With respect to the reviewer\u2019s suggestion for the property function, we believe it will be an interesting direction to explore and see if it\u2019s closer to other DST baselines. We kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019 for more details.\n\n**N-Best beam search (BS) hypotheses Vs. Sampling**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this comment. We have conducted experiments with both sampling and n-best BS hypotheses, which didn\u2019t indicate that n-best BS is superior to the sampling method. Moreover, running a BS decoder at every training step requires more resources and training time. We kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019 for elaborated explanation and a speculation as to why n-best BS method is not superior in this case.\n\n**Latency  WER optimization compete with each other**\n\nWER and Latency were two property examples for AWP. We optimized each property separately in order to compare with previous results. Yet, the simplicity of AWP allows us to combine the losses together, or to use a single property function that improves both properties simultaneously, and test how the two properties compete with each other. We added this comment to the discussion in section 5.\n\n**Is the optimization sensitive to a specific choice of the property function?**\n\nWe experimented with multiple implementations of the property functions, and eventually reported the simplest (and evidently the most effective) implementation. Empirically, we found that other implementations worked as well. We added appendix C in the paper to shed more light on that matter. We kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019 for more details on the different variations of the property function.  \n\n**An Alternative approach for the latency application which samples ground truth (GT) alignments and compares them to an alignment obtained by a force aligner**\n\nWe presume the objective is to derive a forced alignment from an offline model. Otherwise, drawing it from the concurrently trained online model introduces uncertainty regarding its time accuracy and latency compared to the random GT alignment. While one might expect the online model's latency to match the offline model, negative values in table 2 indicate our property function implementation encourages the online model to drift beyond the offline. Additionally, our implementation diverges from prior works like Tian et al., 2022 by extending beyond perfect alignments. The choice not to limit the property function to perfect alignments aligns with the notion that streaming ASR systems should emit fast even if the transcript is inaccurate.\n\n**AWP with an offline Conformer**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's feedback. The Conformer experiments were not fully matured by the ICLR deadline. We chose to present the offline model with AWP as a proof of concept, assuming success with an offline model implies potential success with an online model. To adapt the offline model to an online setting, at inference we restricted its context (both right and left) so it works in a streaming manner. We updated table 2 with the online Conformer, and show that although it wasn\u2019t trained as an online model, but inferred as one, the performance of the Conformer with AWP shows a significant DL reduction and only a mild reduction in WER.\n\n**Start Epoch as a tunable hyperparameter for balancing between latency and quality. How transferable is the optimal start epoch to different settings?**\n\nFigure 6 right indicates that tuning alpha is a better practice for balancing between latency and accuracy. However, figure 6 left shows that tuning start-epoch allows some balancing, as there\u2019s a ~11% WER deterioration if applied after 0.9 epochs instead of 16.7. Empirically we found that applying AWP works best after CTC training loss reaches 80-90% accuracy, which may vary across different settings (i.e. dataset, etc). We kindly refer the reviewer to the \u2018common response\u2019  for more details.\n\n**WSR in figure 6**\n\n WSR is word success rate, 100-WER. We changed figure 6 to present WER."
