I suggest the authors compare their work to more adequate baselines, e.g the ones presented in [1] and [2]. This would help in understanding how effective their method is in action-conditioned and unconditional video generation.\n* **Performance in the control task**: when compared to IRIS and DreamerV3 on (a reduced set of) the Atari100k benchmark, the performance of DWM is not really superior. While this is understandable for DreamerV3, as behaviour is learned differently, it is surprising that the method performs worse than IRIS in 4/8 games. It would also be interesting to see what are the performance in the other games of the 100k benchmark, that are currently not shown.\n\nGiven the limited technical novelty, I would expect the performance of this approach to be strong in order to recommend acceptance, which doesn't seem to be the case. For this reason, I am leaning towards rejecting the paper.\n\n[1] Temporally Consistent Transformers for Video Generation, Yan et al, 2023\n\n[2] A Control-Centric Benchmark for Video Prediction, Tian et al, 2023"

(2020b) argue that they need only model task-relevant information, which necessarily\nleads to limited image predictions.`, but I could not find such a statement in the paper. I think this statement mostly applies to other lines of work, such as MuZero. I would appreciate if the authors could clarify this or update the citation.\n* Q2 and Q3 in the experiments section require trivial YES/NO answers.

The diffusion model learns to predict the next pixel observation conditioned on a past window of observations and actions, along with the current action.  Then, it can essentially replace the encoder and latent dynamics models of reconstruction-based model-based reinforcement learning models.  The videos produced were judged in terms of visual quality metrics, as well as how useful they were towards solving RL tasks."

Although the authors simply replace the IRIS model with a visual dynamics model learned through diffusion, the diffusion modeling itself conditioned on past frames and actions is novel.\nQuality: The quality of this work could be improved with more thorough experimentation and well-motivated reasoning.\nClarity: The paper is clear on their work and contributions.\nSignificance: This paper is not of particularly high significance, in that the results do not substantially outperform existing world models approaches such as Dreamerv3.  Furthermore, DWM only conditions on 6 frames, and may not be a particularly scalable solution (especially when eventually used to model visual environments with larger and larger visual resolution)."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "This work proposes utilizing diffusion to learn high-fidelity videos conditioned on past observations and actions.  This then can be used to learn a world model.  However, the motivation behind the approach is not fully motivated.\n\nThe authors compare the video generated from their approach according to metrics from video generation literature, such as FID and FVD.  Indeed, it is not particularly surprising that the proposed model works better according to these metrics.  The other models that they compare against are model-based approaches with learned latent embeddings and dynamics.  This makes for an unfair comparison, as such models are not naturally expected to have as high fidelity in terms of image generation as something that operates purely in image space.  The pixel reconstruction objective of MBRL is not necessarily there to learn exact video reconstructions, but as a prior to help learn useful latents which is useful for planning in imagination.\n\nThis work begs the question of whether or not super-high visual quality even matters for reinforcement learning; the authors make the assumption that it does, but this reviewer does not believe such a belief should be taken for granted.  Indeed, for the purpose of encoding information, not all the visual details need to matter.  For example, the visual pattern of a floor being checkered or plain is not necessary for learning how to walk over it.  Indeed, fixed patterns, textures, and other visual details often are not relevant to solving a task at hand, and therefore compressing a visual scene into a latent can still be powerful enough to solve the task (where such task-irrelevant visual details can be reconstructed cheaply through a simultaneously learned decoder, allowing the latent to focus on hopefully task-relevant information).  Even as humans, we often are unable to recall in explicit, vivid visual detail what occurred in the past, or what we imagine might happen in the future.  Rough, fuzzy, visual memories and/or plans are often enough for human needs.  This suggests from a huamn-inspired angle that perhaps hyper-resolution planning is not of paramount importance, and generally accurate reconstructions may be good enough for solving tasks (with perhaps more accurate visual reconstructions of things that are relatively more important).  Then, whereas it is understandable that visual quality of predictions should improve, it does not necessarily need to be of utmost important to model in a hyper-detailed manner.  This reviewer believes that this explains why Dreamerv3 does not substantially suffer in the provided Atari results over DWM, despite having worse visual generation fidelity.  Indeed this reviewer believes that the utilized metrics of FID, FVD, etc. may not actually be the right metrics to use for the purposes of understanding usefulness for MBRL efforts, and can be potentially misleading.\n\nFurthermore, a weakness of the work stems from the experiments chosen to showcase DWM.  DWM was motivated as a world model; however, the experiments to showcase the environments it can learn policies for was limited to Atari.  This reviewer is curious as to why only the Atari experiments were performed, when world models have also been applied to continuous control tasks such as the DeepMind Control Suite, Minecraft, DMLab, and more (such as in the listed Dreamerv3).  Furthermore, despite showcasing visual quality results on CSGO and Driving, no policies were learned for them.\n\nTo be more thorough in comparing with existing world models, this reviewer suggests comparing against world models that do not rely on reconstruction, such as TDMPC.\n\nAnother interesting decision is why offline datasets were considered at all, given that they are prone to causal confusion and instabilities, as the authors stated in the paper.  Indeed, the authors only visualize fidelity of videos for such datasets, which is not necessarily the best metric to care about when looking to learn policies.  The authors do not learn policies from DWM trained on offline datasets."

In the absence of that, I would expect the experiments to be very strong, but neither video metrics nor RL performance provides a very convincing argument. While video metrics are good compared to others, these metrics are agnostic to actions, and hence of limited value in evaluating a world model. I would expect a useful metric to include the faithfulness to some action, and compare that against the baselines. The downstream performance seems limited compared to existing work, and it is not clear it is worth spending the additional computational effort on high quality visual features. Moreover, it is difficult to make a careful assessment in the absence of error bars on the return scores. In my opinion, the most impressive part of the paper is in Figs. 7 and 8, but the results presented there are too few to carefully asses the model capabilities. \nQuestions:\n- Can the authors provide more material like Figs 7 and 8 in the appendix? It is not clear how well the learned model generalizes.\nIn the absence of substantial improvement in terms of downstream performance, this seems like an important thing to demonstrate.\n- Video metrics are nice, but I don't think are as relevant as faithfulness to the input action. I am not aware of such a \"conditional video metric\", but it would be great if the authors could evaluate their model and their baselines on such a metric. It would be a great opportunity to introduce one that other researchers can use.\n- Can uncertainties in Table 2 be added? Interpreting the results without is not possible. \n- Can the authors add a quantitative result that demonstrates their world model indeed behaves like a world model? This question is related to the earlier question about the faithfulness to input actions."

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer CvA6 for their detailed and insightful review.\n\n**Q1 \u2013 Model generalization**\n\nThank you for highlighting the value of Figure 7 & 8. [Here is a link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aaCx2TljjKh4nefccktxk286npeRFf7g?usp=sharing) to several videos showing generated trajectories, beginning from the same initial state and applying various constant actions, for CS:GO and motorway driving. Since the world model is trained on offline datasets from expert-level policies, some of the trajectories quickly become out of distribution when certain constant action sequences are input. For example, the driving dataset does not contain trajectories where a steering is applied to take the car off the road. Hence, whilst the world model tends to do well at modeling immediate frames, they sometimes do not generalize well when pushed beyond this. We note this is a symptom of the training data, rather than anything specific to our diffusion world model.\n\n**Q2 \u2013 Metrics testing faithfulness to actions**\n\nAs the reviewer notes, a perfect action-conditioned video metric is hard to find. However, the LPIPS metric is, to the best of our knowledge, the current favored choice. LPIPS compares frames in a pairwise fashion (real to generated), and in order to do well in this metric, the effect of an action _must_ be modeled correctly. Note however that it does not account for an environment\u2019s stochasticity, hence being imperfect. On the other hand, the FVD metric measures action faithfulness less directly, but _does_ account for stochasticity in the environment being modeled. Hence when combined, the two metrics are able to measure action faithfulness and stochasticity.\n\n**Q3 \u2013 Table 2 uncertainties**\n\nWe are in the process of rerunning this benchmark, but have not been able to complete this during the rebuttal period. We will share a fully updated table in due course. \n\n**Q4 \u2013 Quantitative metrics demonstrating world model behavior**\n\nThank you for this question, which we believe we were not clear enough about in the main paper. The purpose of dividing the experiments into two sections was to show: 1) DWM can be effective as part of a typical dyna-style algorithm to train an RL agent in imagination, which is a holistic test of DWM\u2019s abilities. 2) DWM also scales to visually complex environments. We chose to demonstrate this in real-world motorway driving and a modern video game. Due to the complexity of these environments, however, we were unable to also test dyna-style agents in these settings, and hence report the best available offline metrics."

The authors propose utilizing a diffusion model to create a world model, which can then be harnessed by a reinforcement learning agent. The authors' primary innovation centers around the parametrization and implementation of the diffusion model for a reinforcement learning setting.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of their approach, the authors conducted experiments in various environments with varying levels of visual complexity. For instance, they tested their model generation capability on environments such as CS:GO which offer intricate 3D visual worlds  and real-life video inputs from the Motorway Driving dataset, \n\nIn addition to exploring the model's capability to generate videos in the CS:GO and Motorway datasets, the authors also report the performance of their reinforcement learning-trained agent in the context of the Atari benchmarks."

However, this hypothesis remains unverified, as the authors do not assess the performance of an RL agent in the context of CS:GO and Motorway driver tasks; instead, they solely focus on evaluating video generation capabilities. It remains uncertain why improved video generation metrics would necessarily correlate with improved performance in downstream RL tasks, which is the ultimate objective of a world model.\n\nFurthermore,  it is unclear from the empirical study concerning the Atari environment that a world diffusion model offers advantages over alternatives like Dreamerv3 and Iris in terms of returns or human-normalized scores?"

This validation would underscore the significance of the proposed approach."
