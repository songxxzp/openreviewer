They demonstrate that the above approach is beats student model pretrained and linearly probed both in terms of accuracy and GPU days."

                    "value": "I have several large issues with this work, which primarily stem from the lack of novelty.\n\n* In particular, the proposed scenario, in which one distills from a teacher model which was pretrained ahead of time before being adapted to the target task at hand, is essentially just the standard distillation setting with the ONLY difference being that the teacher starts from pre-training. \n\n* Are there any significant differences in the insights gained or the difficulties surrounding the distillation process that require such a separate treatment (beyond the fact that distillation from teachers that were pretrained ahead of time is in itself not novel)? \n\n* Furthermore, the proposed distillation objective appears very derivative of contrastive distillatio proposed in Tian et al. 2020. It would be important if the authors provided a stronger differentation here.\n\n* Similarly, the use of synthetic data to help train a model is orthogonal and not novel, and has been studied to significant extend, particularly with recent improvements in large-scale generative modeling as the authors also note in their related works. However, just deploying this to the task of Knowledge Distillation is an insufficient contribution.\n\n* Beyond the lack of novelty, the experiments are also unfortunately quite lackluster - for a claim that involves applicability to \"any pretrained teacher model\", only testing on two teachers does not provide sufficient breadth. In addition, I'm not sure if the provided results are comparable - is synthetic data also used for the base finetuning of the teacher models, which are then claimed to be outperformed by the student using large-scale synthetic data? \n\n* Adding to that, just training a linear probe on top of a teacher is insufficient exploration into teacher finetuning to claim sufficient adaptation to a target task at hand, particular when distribution shifts are larger.\n\n* Finally, I have some issues regarding formulations used in this paper, starting at the title iself, which is contradictory to what is actually proposed, as the introduced setup does leverage pretraining TO teach and for synthetic data generation. Beyond that, the authors sell knowledge distillation as the primary means for suitable model deployment on edge devices to leverage smaller architectures, disregarding research into model quantization, pruning, etc. It would be great if this could be contextualized better."

Absence of crucial references and an insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods in knowledge distillation.**\n\nWhile the author has touched upon various studies in the domain of knowledge distillation, the discussion appears to be incomplete. For example, works such as [1, 2] that delve into efficient (pre-)training via knowledge distillation techniques, have already revealed that knowledge distillation can be used as an effective technique to boost the training efficiency for tasks including image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. \n\nIn a closely related domain, active knowledge distillation can, to a degree, achieve the objectives set by the authors, making it imperative to discuss and compare with studies like [3]. \n\n**2. The observation offered by the authors in this paper is not novel to me.**\n\nConsidering these pertinent studies listed above, the main contribution of this paper, *i.e.* employing distillation for expediting the training process, doesn't strike me as particularly novel. One new aspect of this paper is the authors' use of solely synthetic data for distillation. However, this shift in data source doesn't seem substantial enough to stand as the core contribution for a paper published at ICLR.\n\n**3. The experimental results presented in this paper are somewhat underwhelming to me.**\n\nIn light of the benchmarks set by leading methods in the realm of knowledge distillation, the performance depicted in this paper feels somewhat middling. For instance, when employing ResNet-18 as the student and ResNet-50 as the teacher, [1] manages to attain 82.22% in a mere 16 GPU hours. In contrast, this paper's proposed technique takes over 24 GPU hours to reach a modest 75.8%.\n\nWhile I concede that there might be nuances that make a direct comparison slightly skewed, it remains necessary for the authors to validate their approach in comparable scenarios and surpass at least one of the aforementioned studies. One experiment that might be needed is to merge the real and synthetic data and then apply the proposed method of this paper to see whether the proposed method can surpass the previous works in knowledge distillation.\n\n\n### Reference\n\n> [1] He R, Sun S, Yang J, et al.

The results provided in the appendix (Tab. 5 and 6) show better performance of CRD++. S-LP is not defined in the text.\n* It would be helpful to have clarity on the number of experiments behind each reported measurement and the inclusion of standard deviations.\n* \"small models\" and cost considerations need to be clearly defined. The paper seems not to account for certain factors that contribute to the total cost, such as training the existing pre-trained models.\n* How does the method compare to NAS or pruning (given limited space or a constraint on the inference time)? The reviewer believes the problem of training a \"small model\" for a specific domain needs a more holistic approach. Considering both learning methods and architectural choices, might offer a more comprehensive solution for edge and mobile devices. The proposed method looks at the problem in a limited way by considering training / data aspects only.\n* While synthetic samples do enhance performance, it remains unclear if baselines are also exposed to them during training, raising questions about fairness in comparisons."
