These two experiments will help us understand the exact contribution of the difference in blueprint style and the modifications proposed compared to the one in the literature (Narayan et al.)\n\nIndeed, the bottom part of Table 1 corresponded to the results from Narayan et al. which as we stated (Section 5.1 second paragraph) are not directly comparable. We only included them here for completeness. It is certainly not the goal of this paper to have a better blueprint model compared to the ones proposed by Narayan et al., rather we want to explore how to extend these models to perform attribution.\n\nDuring the early stages of this research we did explore the difference between using only questions plans or QA plans, we did not find meaningful differences (as shown below for an abstractive end to end model), so we decided to continue using Q plans since these are more flexible (i.e., generated questions can be generic and do not require an answer span to be extracted from the input).\n\n|    | ROUGE-L | ANLI  |\n|----|---------|-------|\n| QA | 0.558   | 0.760 |\n| Q  | 0.553   | 0.769 |\n\nWe also studied the impact of using the retriever (numbers below for an abstractive model). We found that the reranker does indeed improve both ROUGE and ANLI. However, the main motivation for using the reranker is because we need a set of passages on which to perform attribution (which is not the case in Narayan et. al where they use the full documents in the input)\n\n|    | ROUGE-L | ANLI  |\n|----|---------|-------|\n| Q     |     0.553      | 0.769 |\n| Q + reranker |     0.623      | 0.791 |\n\n> A simple/traditional baseline for attribution quality will better ground our understanding.\n\nThe baseline model we trained (Model (a) in Figure 1) is the traditional attribution baseline.\n\n> Table 5 with (-blueprint + attributions) will make for better comparison\n\nIn Section 6,  our goal is to examine whether the most performant model from the main experiments (Section 5) learns robust attribution capabilities that generalize to domain and task changes. That is why we only evaluated the Blueprint model."

Also how would this model differ from the base LongT5 model of Narayan et al?  \n- Are the number of contextual passages 10 for all the query examples? It would be nice to see an ablation as to how the models perform with increasing complexity of the context. \n- Could the authors comment on the individual performance of Question Generator and Answerability classifier? What is the overall accuracy of the classifier? How many generated questions were actually determined to be answerable by the classifier? \n- In section 5.2, the authors note that \u201cThe plot reveals that the extractive model generates the most abstractive responses\u201d. Do authors have an intuition of this counterintuitive observation? \n- It is mentioned that blueprint plans improve attribution quality. Could the authors quantify this? It is hard to distinguish between attribution and blueprint. \n- Fig 1 shows the same summaries for the baseline as well as extractive, abstractive models which seem to be scripted and less informative.

                        "value": "> It is also not clear what are the main contributions of the model wrt Narayan et al (2023).\n\nIn this paper we explore how to best develop models with a *built-in* mechanism for attribution, which is not something that was addressed in Narayan et al. 2023. We investigate whether blueprint-style models can enhance attribution capabilities compared to alternatives which do not follow a plan-based architecture. A secondary question relates to the blueprints themselves and how they should be formulated for better attribution (i.e., abstractive vs extractive blueprints). In total, this work addresses three questions (articulated in the last paragraph of the introduction) in relation to attribution, which again is out of scope for Narayan et al. 2023. Compared to related work on attribution, we are not aware of any other models which employ planning to enhance evidence-based generation capabilities  (See updated second to last paragraph in the Introduction)\n\n> It is not clear if the passages used for grounding are retrieved or just re-ranked from the given 10 passages for each instance.\n\nJust re-ranked (Section 4. Second paragraph)\n> Table 1 suddenly shows ablations with attribution while it is not explicitly explained in the earlier sections. Does the attribution here refer to \u201cgenerating text with citations\u201d only? Was this originally not part of the task formulation? If not, then do the authors post-process the generated summary to remove the citations while performing evaluation? It would help to clarify this in the starting of the text.\n\nWe have rewritten  our description of  comparison models in Section 5.1 and added  references to previous sections.\n\nThe attribution was explained earlier in the paper (Section 3.1), so yes \u201cattribution\u201d in Table 1 refers to generating text with citations. Indeed attribution is part of the task formulation, nevertheless by also showing results for models without attribution we can observe whether this added capability improves answer quality.\n\nTo evaluate answer quality (ROUGE-L and ANLI) , we indeed remove  citations (we now state this explicitly in Section 4).\n> It is not clear as to how extractive models learn to copy. Is there any utilization of the forced copy mechanism?\n\nThe model *learns* to copy given that it is fine-tuned on  data which contains blueprint questions  directly copied from the input. We verified this fact by checking the percentage of copied questions in the predictions which is 98.94% exact match or 99.91% ROUGE-L.\n> The authors mention that a question generation model is not available at transfer time to ALCE dataset. It is not clear why this is not the case for an abstractive model?\n\nThe abstractive model does not need the input to be augmented with extra questions (as opposed to the extractive model) and it has already been trained to generate a plan (i.e., a sequence of questions) and the answer, so we can use it directly with any other input and it will generate the blueprint and the answer. If we wanted to use the extractive model, we would need to generate questions for the input passages, as this model expects that as part of its input (See Figure 1).\n> Pictorial depiction of the models could aid in understanding the proposed approach.\n\nDo you mean to add something else apart from Figure 1 ?\n> It seems the relevant baselines haven\u2019t been used like GPT-3.5/4 or open-sourced LLMs like LLaMA-2 where the field has evolved a lot in recent years.\n\nWe do compare  our approach against these models using the ALCE benchmark.\n> Table 5 shows consistent decreased performance of the proposed models for correctness compared to the baselines (especially on QAMPARI and ELI5 datasets). It indicates that the model learns to hallucinate, producing more citations but incorrect results.\n\nFirstly, we found a typo in our ALCE results and updated the QAMPARI results of our model (from 0.8 to 12.9). With this fix, we now see that across all datasets the correctness score of our blueprint model is on par with LLaMA-13B. Even still, the reviewers are correct in pointing out that the correctness of our model is inferior compared with the others LLMs.\n\nWe emphasize that this is *not due to hallucinations*, but rather because the models returned *faithful but incorrect* responses. Given that the attribution score is high, information in the responses should be attributed back to the passages (see examples in Tables 10, 12, and 14). This is in contrast to LLaMA-13B, which has a similar correctness score but a significantly worse attribution score.\n\nFurthermore, the main goal of evaluating on ALCE is comparing the robustness of the attribution capabilities of our blueprint model (3B) to that of large language models (13B) and commercial solutions (ChatGPT). Our results show that such capabilities are robust and superior to all the other models."

                        "value": "Thank you authors for the response!\n\n- It seems that the preliminary human study does not support the results well with only 10 examples. There is also limited information about the human eval which seems to be rushed. How was the human evaluation conducted with some information about their qualification? Was the inner agreement calculated among annotators? The procedure of annotation should be described in detail. It is also not clear what dataset was used for human evaluation. \n- The authors mention that \u201cTable 1 results are not comparable to Narayan et al\u201d. Is it because of the re-ranking? An ablation study in this regard without the retriever could provide direct comparison with the relevant baselines. \n- Similarly, while recent LLMs have been compared for the ALCE benchmark, how well do they perform on AQuAMuSe dataset as a baseline. \n- As another fellow reviewer pointed out, the difference between abstractive and extractive models is still not clear. The authors mention that the extractive model \u201clearns\u201d to copy. Do the extractive models provide spans or generate the questions without any copy supervision? How does this make it different from abstractive models? \n- The technical novelty is limited with contributions beyond attribution are not extensively detailed where planning for generation is not new (Narayan et al). It seems that this work is incremental in this regard. \n\nWith these questions in mind, I invite the authors to include relevant baselines uniformly for both AQuAMuSe and ALCE benchmark with detailed ablation studies of the importance of the attribution and blueprint for both benchmarks. It would also be nice to have a proper human evaluation study. I stand by my original rating till then."

                        "value": "Thank you again for responding and acknowledging our response!\n\n* **Human Study**\n\nWe apologize for the lack of clarity of the human study we conducted during this rebuttal period. The annotators were given a citing sentence in the summary and the passage/s it has cited (they also have access to the whole summary as context in case the sentence needed to be decontextualized). They were then asked to classify whether all information in the citing sentence can be found in the set of cited passage/s. The score we presented is the accuracy of their classification.\n\nGiven the setting above, the study has been done at the **sentence level**, therefore while we may have only asked annotators to do 10 examples, this actually meant them annotating 153 sentences in total. Still, we do agree with the reviewer that this may not be enough. However, we hope the reviewer understands that this is all due to the time constraint. To make the study more reliable, we additionally tested significance (McNemar\u2019s test; p<0.05) and it shows that the extractive and baseline models are significantly different.\n\nWe plan to include a more extensive human evaluation in the final version.\n\n* **Ablation with retriever**\n\nWe want to remind the reviewer that the main goal of the paper is to improve attribution through planning. The main reason why Narayan et al.'s models are not comparable is because these models **do not produce attribution**. However, we do understand that the reviewer is curious of the differences between our models and theirs. We responded the following to another reviewer who also asked a similar question:\n\nDuring the early stages of this research we did explore the difference between using only questions plans or QA plans, we did not find meaningful differences (as shown below for an abstractive end to end model), so we decided to continue using Q plans since these are more flexible (i.e., generated questions can be generic and do not require an answer span to be extracted from the input).\n\n|          |   ROUGE-L  | ANLI  |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| QA   |    0.558      | 0.760 |\n| Q     |     0.553      | 0.769 |\n\nWe also studied the impact of using the retriever (numbers below for an abstractive model). We found that the reranker does indeed improve both ROUGE and ANLI. However, the main motivation for using the reranker is because we need a set of passages on which to perform attribution (which is not the case if we simply pass all the documents in the input as done in Narayan et. al).\n\n|                            | ROUGE-L | ANLI  |\n| -- | -- | -- |\n| Q                      |     0.553      | 0.769 |\n| Q + reranker |     0.623      | 0.791 |\n\n* **LLMs on AQuAMuSE**\n\nWe did an additional experiment for another reviewer where we used a 5-shot prompt on GPT-3.5 turbo with 16k context (gpt-3.5-turbo-16k) and obtained the following results on 100 examples from the test split of AQuAMuSE (again, apologies if we could not do the larger test split).\n\n|                          \t\t          | AutoAIS | \n|---------------------------|----------------------|\n| -Blueprint +Attribution       | 28.11               \t           |\n| +Blueprint_A +Attribution | 52.21            \t           |\n\nThe results still show that the blueprint contributes to having better attribution but the numbers are overall lower than those of fine tuned models.\n\nWe have also tested on the larger test split using an in-house LLM and got similar results, however due to time constraints, we are not able to obtain legal approvals.\n\n* **Extractive Blueprint Model**\n\nWe believe the reviewer's questions regarding the extractive blueprint model can be answered by Figure 1. There is no built-in extractive mechanism (i.e., no copy mechanisms or special training/loss/supervision). The difference from abstractive model is the addition of passage-specific questions in the input (please see Figure 1 of the paper). The extractive model learns to copy from these questions in the input, while the abstractive model does not have access to questions in the input. We do not need any copy mechanism as mentioned in our previous response since the questions in the output are 98.94% of the time copied from the input (and has 99.91% ROUGE-L compared to the input)."

In the present paper, blueprint models take as input a query and a set of retrieved passages for that query, and then the model predicts a blueprint (sequence of quetions) and a long-for response to the questions (with citations) in a single decoding step. The paper reports on trained blueprint models that do extractive answering and abstractive answering. The main experiments are with the AQuAMuSe dataset, and both extractive and abstractive blueprint models perform extremely well. The models also perform exceptionally well at the citation step, and a separate set of experiments on the ALCE dataset show that the AQuAMuSe-trained models are competitive with ChatGPT and other LLMs."

The authors propose two methods for blueprint generation: the abstractive model and the extractive model. \n\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on both the summary quality and the citation quality - the blueprint generation and the attribution generation mutually enhance each other as well as the summary generation quality. \n\nThe authors also conduct experiments on the ALCE benchmark. The proposed method achieved better performance for citation generation while falling behind for correctness. Since the ALCE benchmark does not have training data, the proposed method cannot surpass the LLM-based in-context learning methods in terms of correctness, but surpass citation generation since it's explicitly fine-tuned."

                        "value": "> 1. The major concern is the lack of novelty in the proposed method. The question generation modules are not new.\n\nIn this paper we explore how to best develop models with a *built-in* mechanism for attribution, which is not something that was addressed in Narayan et al. 2023. We investigate whether blueprint-style models can enhance attribution capabilities compared to alternatives which do not follow a plan-based architecture. A secondary question relates to the blueprints themselves and how they should be formulated for better attribution (i.e., abstractive vs extractive blueprints). In total, this work addresses three questions (articulated in the last paragraph of the introduction) in relation to attribution, which again is out of scope for Narayan et al. 2023. Compared to related work on attribution, we are not aware of any other models which employ planning to enhance evidence-based generation capabilities  (See updated second to last paragraph in the Introduction)\n\n> 2. In the experiments on the ALCE benchmark, the correctness score falls far behind the LLM-based few-shot prompting methods.\n\nFirstly, we found a typo in our ALCE results and updated the QAMPARI results of our model (from 0.8 to 12.9). With this fix, we now see that across all datasets the correctness score of our blueprint model is on par with LLaMA-13B. Even still, the reviewers are correct in pointing out that the correctness of our model is inferior compared with the others LLMs.\n\nWe emphasize that this is *not due to hallucinations*, but rather because the models returned *faithful but incorrect* responses. Given that the attribution score is high, information in the responses should be attributed back to the passages (see examples in Tables 10, 12, and 14). This is in contrast to LLaMA-13B, which has a similar correctness score but a significantly worse attribution score.\n\nFurthermore, the main goal of evaluating on ALCE is comparing the robustness of the attribution capabilities of our blueprint model (3B) to that of large language models (13B) and commercial solutions (ChatGPT). Our results show that such capabilities are robust and superior to all the other models.\n\n> 3. The writing of the paper should be significantly improved. There are too many redundant narratives but less focus on the overall technical contribution.\n\nWe have uploaded an updated version which makes the contributions clearer, and includes several rewrites following the reviewers\u2019 comments and questions."
