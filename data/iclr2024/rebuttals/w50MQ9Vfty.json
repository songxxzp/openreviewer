This paper attempts to correct for interference by designing an experiment on a subset of the data that consists of non-interfering units. Given an interference network this paper provides an algorithm for treating units for various parameter goals. The paper provides a comparison on the sample efficiency of the method related to other methods and provides bias and variance computations."

This paper attempts to design a more robust methodology towards this idea but relies on knowledge of the underlying network G. In practice this is never known and the paper does not consider the case of a misspecified G. \n\nThe theoretical results are good but they rely on stringent assumptions (although possibly weaker than other works). In particular it seems that the sample efficiency results are specific to the case of an erdos-renyi graph. Furthermore, the methodology rules out complete graphs and in general requires a degree of sparsity in the underlying graph. Since G is given or estimated this could be enforced but possibly unpalatable in some cases. Furthermore, as with other approaches to interference using partitioning algorithm there is a trade off with statistical power."

Could this effect the internal validity of the study if randomization is weakened (i.e. in the vein of Bugni, Canay, and Shaikh 2017) moreover could there be distributional differences between the independent set and aux sets?\n- Since treatment effects can only be computed on the independent set how does this impact possible external validity of the study?"

For the weakness part, the reviewer commented on the few assumptions that are proposed in the paper. We list our responses as below:\n1. In our paper, we assume the network is observed at least before the partitioning step. This is usually the case. For example, the interference can the friendship network in social networks or the transportation network for the supply chain problems. It is a common assumption (see Ugander et al., 2013; Forastiere et at., 2021; Cai et al., 2022)  Our work focuses on observed network, and the design of experiment is on observed networks, but it is a good direction for the future work when network G is misspecified,  and we include that in our discussion as future work.\n 2. We agree it is always helpful to inspect models on real data. However, the paper focus more on the design and theory\u2014 while in real data we never know the true potential outcomes and true effects. Therefore, we compare our design with other designs on the synthetic datasets, where we can artificially set the truth and compare the performances. \n 3. If we understand the reviewer\u2019s question correctly, it is about the representativeness of the outcomes after a deterministic assignment of the treatments. We admit that, for a given sample set (that is a fixed potential outcomes and a fixed observed network), the greedy algorithm and the optimization of assignments do indeed weaken the representativeness of the observed outcomes because the vertices has unequal probabilities of being assigned to treated or being partitioned to the independent set. This is why we are NOT claiming our estimation is unbiased for the given sample set of data. Instead, we DO claim the unbiasedness from the super-population perspective (Assumption 2), where all samples along with their potential outcomes and their network are assumed to be sampled from the population. We would refer to Section 7.3 of Imbens and Rubin (2015) for the super-population framework. This is related to our response to point 9 of reviewer DrFU.\n4.

For the weakness part, we would like to clarify the questions the reviewer commented on in a point-to-point fashion. \n1. Figure 2 illustrates a detailed visualization of confidence intervals to show how bias and variance for different designs change when interference gamma increases. We use n = 60 as an illustration example. Table 2 provides more comparisons of different designs on distinct random graphs when interference is fixed, hence we let n = {100, 200, 400} to introduce diversity.\n2. We add the simulation results of  graph cluster randomization to the revised manuscript in Figure 2.\n3. Graph clustering is same as the randomized saturation design except that the user needs to cluster the units when no clear cut-offs exist. We use multi-level modularity optimization(Blondel, Vincent D., et al, 2008) for the clustering. Since there is no clear cluster boundary in the network, graph clustering is inferior to the independent set design due to significant bias.To better illustrate the performance of graph clustering,  we add the simulation results of graph cluster randomization to the revised manuscript.\n 4. Some of the designs listed in Table 1 are widely used designs, which were not necessarily designed for the causal inference over a well-connected interference network. The performance of other designs in Table 1 are obviously inferior to our approach. That is why only a few methods are compared for demonstration purpose. Additional results of comparison with other designs in Table 1 have included in the revised manuscript, include ego-clusters and graph cluster (similar to randomized saturation). \n 5. Thm 1 from Section 4.2 provides a lower bound for the size of the independent set, which suffices to show its superiority over other methods. In the simulation part, the variance roughly scales as 1/n, which is much better than the lower bound provided in Section 4.2. \n6. The variance scales as 1/n_I from the theoretical perspective. \n7. in 5.2 we let \\rho = 0 when estimating  ATE(the average direct effects)\n8. For the nomenclature question, yes, they can be considered as the direct effect and the total effect.\n9. In practice, any sub-sample/separation design involves the representativeness issue on a fixed sample dataset. On the one hand, the first step in the greedy algorithm involves a random choice of the first vertex. Every vertex has a positive probability of being selected to the independent set. The bias from the greedy algorithm is alleviated by the stochastic algorithm, similar to previous work, such as Saint-Jacqueset al., 2019;  Uganderetal.,2013.  On the other hand, we are aiming to estimate the population causal effect instead of the sample averaged causal effect. A bias in the representativeness of the independent set to the sample set is mitigated by considering the super-population perspective, where, under repeated experiments, the network and the potential outcome are randomly drawn from the population. Therefore, the estimator is unbiased for the populational causal effect in the super-population framework (instead of the unbiasedness for sample average effect).\n\nReference:\n-  Blondel, V.

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer for his/her detailed and insightful comments. We list our point-to-point responses to the weaknesses and questions:\n 1.  We listed a few other designs in the manuscripts for comparison, which includes the completely randomized design (CRD), randomized saturation design/graph clustering design (RSD), ego-clusters design (ECD). Neither of CRD or RSD is suitable for the networks described in the manuscript, which are well, though sparsely, connected. The reasons are (1) in CRD, most of the vertices receive an interference level as 1/2, resulting in a huge variance in the regression estimator;  (2) RSD requires isolated clusters \u2014 otherwise, significant bias arises. Only the ECD aims to solve a similar problem. However, as we illustrated in Table 1, at least for Erdos-Renyi random graphs, ECD is expected to have a smaller sample size compared to our methods. In summary, compared to CRD and RSD, which were developed for other problems, our method guarantees a smaller bias and smaller variance. Compared to ECD, our method achieves a larger effective sample size, resulting in a smaller variance (see e.g. Thm 3). \n2. As we mentioned in the above response, compared to the well-known CRD, we do not require SUTVA, that is, we allow for interference. Compared to RSD (which is widely used in networks with interference), we relax the partial interference assumption to a heterogenous version in Assumption 1, and we do not require an isolated clustering structure of the network for the estimator to be unbiased. \n3. We admit that the current lower bound is developed for Erdos-Renyi random graph. The distribution of the sampled network is determined by both the populational network and the sampling procedure, which is way too complicated to be discussed in this manuscript. Therefore, we establish the current partition result (Thm 1) on Erdos-Renyi network, while other theorems remain valid for other networks. Performance on other common random networks are evaluated through simulation instead. \n4. Ego-clusters didn\u2019t optimize the selection of egos and can be only applied to estimating spillover effect. To further illustrate the performance of Ego-clusters, we have included new simulation results of Ego-clusters design to the revised manuscript pdf in the updated Table 2 and Figure 2.\n5. Thanks for pointing out the inconsistency of the section numbers, we modified the section numbers."

The paper claims that this independent set is of the order of the size of all nodes in the random graph. They further go on to use this result to estimate the bias and variance for direct effects and spillover effects related to their specific problem setup. They seem to further verify these results through computer simulations of an Erdos-Reyni graph. The results seem interesting to me. Specifically, I like Theorem 1 and based on my prior experience with Erdos-Reyni graphs, the results of this theorem seem to be intuitively correct. However, unfortunately I did not put the effort to follow the proofs in the paper in detail so I cannot independently verify their claims."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments and would like to clarify the weakness the reviewer commented in a point-to-point fashion. \n\n1. \n- Assumption 1 (interference on the proportion) is a very common assumption in experimental designs over networks (see Ugander et al., 2013; Forastiere et at., 2021; Cai et al., 2022). The assumption has two advantages. (1) it simplifies the heterogeneous interference effects from neighbors to a summary statistics (the proportion of treated neighbors) (2) it ensures that the interference received from neighbors are bounded as the proportion is a number between 0 and 1. \n- Assumption 2 (super-population perspective) is common as well (see, for example, Section 7.3 in Imbens and Rubin (2015)). Such an assumption is practical because in real experiments, a small sample of units as well as the underlying network of interference is drawn from the population in order to generate efficient estimations under a limited budget. On the other hand, since there always exist certain exotic networks where the proposed method does not work, our estimator aims to estimate the population causal effect instead of the sample one (with the given network). A similar setup for super-population perspective can be found in Shuangning and Wager (2022). Our setup suffices for the purpose of this paper. \n\n2. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue, there may exist heterogeneous interference. To reduce model complexity, we assume interference only depends on the proportion of treated neighbors, we will leave heterogeneous interference in future work.\n\n3. Thanks for the suggestion, we updated our abstract and other sections to reflect the results are derived for ER random graph.\n\n4. Karwa & Airoldi (2018) can be considered as a special case of our approach. The design of Karwa & Airoldi (2018) could be only used to estimate the direct treatment effects and has no optimization. Our method could be implemented to estimate both the direct treatment effects and the spillover effects, and we optimize the result to find the largest independent set and reduce the variance of the estimation.\n\nReference:\n\n- Johan Ugander, Brian Karrer, Lars Backstrom, and Jon Kleinberg.
