It also studies whether these abilities interact with each other.\n- A new training strategy, Dual-stage Mixed Fine-tuning (DMT), is proposed to address the issue of ability conflicts and catastrophic forgetting during multi-task learning."

                    "value": "1. This is a good empirical paper with solid experimental results. It makes several important observations that might be helpful for later fine-tuning research. For instance, it is interesting to know that SFT data from different sources appears to benefit each other in low-resource settings, but may act as noise when sufficient data is available.\n\n2. The presentation is clear and easy to follow.\n\n3. Though there's less algorithmic novelty in this paper, the empirical problem it studies is important, and there doesn't seem to be previous work focusing on empirically understanding the compositionality and ability conflicts of LLMs."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. Limited abilities/datasets: while the general problem of data composition and ability conflicts is interesting, the paper only focuses on three abilities---reasoning, coding, and aligning general human intentions---and uses only a single dataset for each ability. This raises the question of whether the observed trends and scaling laws can generalize. \n\n2. Limited models: similarly, only the LLaMA families are evaluated. It would be better if the paper can test DMT on several other models so that we could know the empirical observations about training strategies can generalize.\n\n3. The current submission does not contain the training and evaluation code. Hopefully this will be released to facilitate reproducibility when the paper is publicly available."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. General setup: What\u2019s the zero-shot performance (i.e., 0 SFT data) of the models on the three datasets? It's good to have these results as a baseline.\n\n2. RQ1: How is the data selection process performed for each training dataset? Is it random? If so, did you sample using multiple seeds and compared results of different subsets? Are they similar? \n\n3. RQ2: Since the paper mixes the datasets using the same subset ratio instead of the same data amounts, it would be better to indicate the number of data samples for each dataset in the paper. For instance, if one dataset is extremely large and the others are small, will this affect learning the other abilities? Also, it would be interesting to see how the model performs when it is fine-tuned with the same number of data points from each training dataset (rather than same subset ratio).\n\n4. RQ4: The paper discusses sequential training. What is the performance when training with math -> code -> general abilities? Is it different from code -> math -> general abilities?\n\n5. Figure 5 uses the features from the 15th layer of the model. What is the rationale for selecting this particular layer? Would it be better to show results from the beginning or end of the layers?\n\n6. The paper discusses the impact of the distribution gap on acquiring multiple abilities. In the last paragraph of section 4.2, it says that  \"*This distribution gap introduces an extra noise during the SFT phrase, while its removal enables the model to better generalize coding and mathematical abilities.*\" However, I don\u2019t think better **test-time accuracy** means better generalization ability. It can be that the model learns better how to deal with (or even overfit to) the training distributions (after removing code & math from ShareGPT), and removing the data ensures that **the test distribution is similar to the training distribution**. But in reality, the model can encounter diverse data formats such as the ones removed, and we want to generalize to these diverse data formats rather than only being able to perform well on the data included in ShareGPT."

                        "value": "Thanks for your suggestions, we have further added more SFT abilities and more evaluation benchmarks to verify our generalizability.\n### More abilities and datasets\uff1a\nWe are willing to supplement the results of different domain datasets in **Appendix section titled \"VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS IN MORE SFT ABILITIES\"** to verify the generalizability of our conclusions. We have selected several representative datasets to expand the evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs in different dimensions, including **World knowledge (WebQuestionsSP), Language Understanding (CoNLL 2003), and Translation abilities (IWSLT14)**. The experimental results are as follows:\n\n| Datasets           |  CONIL03 (P / R / F1) | WebQSP (F1 / Hits@1) | IWSLT14 (de-en / en-de) |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Single Domain (1/1)| 91.89 / 89.33 / 90.59 | 33.5 / 64.12         | 50 / 52                 |\n| Single Domain (1/2)| 90.59 / 87.15 / 88.83 | 27.10 / 61.87        | 46 / 43                 |\n| Single Domain (1/4)| 85.24 / 79.46 / 82.25 | 22.56 / 61.38        | 42 / 40                 |\n| Single Domain (1/8)| 63.22 / 60.42 / 61.79 | 13.63 / 49.05        | 41 / 40                 |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Mixed Domains (1/1)| 91.74 / 87.79 / 89.72 | 32.10 / 63.70        | 46 / 49                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/2)| 90.69 / 86.93 / 88.77 | 29.98 / 62.29        | 45 / 45                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/4)| 88.81 / 85.62 / 87.18 | 25.42 / 58.02        | 43 / 43                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/8)| 86.47 / 81.18 / 83.74 | 21.36 / 56.86        | 45 / 45                 |\n\n\n**Individual domain:** For the language understanding (NER) task, the performance (P, R, F1) of the model shows a positive correlation with the scaling curve of the data. These two abilities exhibit a similar performance scaling trend as the mathematical ability discussed in RQ1. On the other hand, for world knowledge (WebQSP) in terms of (F1, Hits@1), it also shows a positive correlation trend. However, when the data ratio decreases from 1/4 to 1/8, there is a significant fluctuation in performance. In the case of translation ability, the performance trends for German-English and English-German translations are not entirely consistent. These findings further support the core conclusion of RQ1 that different data exhibit different scaling curves.\n\n**Mixed domains:** The findings align with the conclusions of RQ2 in mixed doamins, which states that abilities are improved with low-resource and decreased with high-resource compared to individual source abilities. This consistent observation holds true for world knowledge, language understanding, and translation abilities."

Therefore, instead of controlling the same amount of data, we select to mix datasets with the same proportion of subsets to better simulate real-world scenarios in all experiments. In addition, We are willing to further supplement the experimental results using different abilities mixed with the equal data amount and compare them with the results using the equla subset proportion. \n\n\n| Methods                              | GSM8K | HumanEval | MT-Bench |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/16, Equal Amount)    | 34.49 | 9.14      | 5.49     |\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/64, Equal Amount)    | 25.02 | 13.54     | 5.21     |\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/256, Equal Amount)   | 16.7  | 11.54     | 4.63     |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/16, Equal Proportion)| 32.97 | 9.16      | 5.52     |\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/64, Equal Proportion)| 25.77 | 14.63     | 5.24     |\n| Mixed Domain(k=1/256, Equal Proportion)| 14.78 | 11.37     | 4.41     |\n\n**Equal Data amount Setting:** we utilize the data amount of GSM8k RFT as the baseline. We sampled data with proportions of {1/16, 1/64, 1/256}, and mixed samples of the same data amount from Code alpaca and ShareGPT.\n\n**Equal Proportion Setting:** we sampled data with proportions of {1/16, 1/64, 1/256} according to the subset proportions of each dataset and mixed them, which is aligned with the setup in RQ2.\n\nIt can be observed that there is not a significant difference in the results of the three benchmark tests between the two settings.

However, to investigate the impact of training order on different SFT abilities, we have conducted additional experiments with six different training orders. The results and analysis of these experiments are provided below:\n\n| Methods                                   | GSM8K | HumanEval | MT-Bench |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|----------|\n| Code -> Math -> General                   | 31.39 | 15.85     | 5.72     |\n| Math -> Code -> General                   | 29.71 | 15.85     | 5.65     |\n| Code -> General -> Math                   | 48.21 | 9.75      | 4.7      |\n| General -> Code -> Math                   | 48.21 | 7.9       | 4.59     |\n| General -> Math -> Code                   | 37.6  | 15.85     | 3.79     |\n| Math -> General -> Code                   | 26.45 | 16.46     | 3.68     |\n\n\nBased on our findings, we conclude the following:\n\n1. The SFT ability trained in the final stage tend to retain relatively good performance.\n\n2. If general and code abilities are trained in the first two stages, there is a noticeable performance decrease in code capability, while math capability does not show significant impact. One possible reason is that the task format of code generation and general ability exhibits similar data distributions (as discussed in RQ3 and Discussion1). This can result in a more severe catastrophic forgetting phenomenon during continuous fine-tuning.\n\nDetailed results can be found in **Appendix section titled \u201cCOMPARISON EXPERIMENT OF DIFFERENT TRAINING SEQUENCES\u201d.**\n\n### Question 5:\n\nBased on your suggestions, we have also added the comparison results between the start layer and the end layer in the **Appendix section titled \u201cVISUALIZATION OF DIFFERENT LAYERS\".** The visualization result of the start layer are relatively chaotic, while the visualization results of the middle layer and the end layer are clearer. And the results of the middle layer and the last layer are consistent in pointing out that both base model and model with DMT strategy exhibit a certain level of separation in the mathematical data representations, there remains a certain degree of overlap between the representations of code and general samples.\n\nFor relevant support, please refer to Figure 18 in Section 6 in this paper [1]. It is also found that the Middle layer has a more stable visualization effect compared to the early layer.\n\n[1] REPRESENTATION ENGINEERING: A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO AI TRANSPARENCY"

In individual domains, the performance of the Llama model in MATH and MBPP is positively correlated with the data volume, similar to the findings in RQ1.\n2. When comparing individual and mixed domains, the llama-7B model exhibits the same pattern of conflicting high-resource performance and low-resource performance gains in MATH and MBPP, consistent with the findings in RQ2.\n3. Combining the results of general abilities in Table 1, we observe that DMT maintains competitive results in MATH and MBPP while prioritizing general abilities. This further validates the effectiveness of DMT, consistent with the findings in RQ4.\n\nThe DMT strategy does have a certain degree of generalization. On the premise of ensuring excellent performance in general capabilities, it has good results in the IND and OOD benchmarks of mathematics and code.

I would like to see more tasks and another dataset comparison before making these large claims as there are many other inconsistencies between the tasks that could lead to differing trends and performance differences beyond just the tasks themselves.\n\n* Results in Table 1 are missing comparisons between datasets (fine-tuning on math and zero-shot or eval on HumanEval).  Results appear to be not much better for DMT compared with existing approaches, and DMT appears to be very particular to these tasks/datasets.  The paper would be much stronger with evaluation on another set of tasks/datasets to show the strategy will generalize.\n\n* The section on scaling laws in LLMs seems a bit out of place in the related work as computing scaling laws is not a primary focus of this work, and there are no conclusions on the amount of data needed based on model size or compute budget for fine-tuning."

                        "value": "Thank you for your suggestions. In fact, as mentioned in the first paragraph of our introduction, our paper primarily focuses on three outstanding abilities (mathematics, coding, and general human-aligned ability) that are of great interest to the LLM community. In addition,  we are willing to supplement the results of different domain datasets in **Appendix section titled \"VALIDATION EXPERIMENTS IN MORE SFT ABILITIES\"** to verify the generalizability of our conclusions. We have selected several representative datasets to expand the evaluation of the capabilities of LLMs in different dimensions, including **World knowledge (WebQuestionsSP [1]), Language Understanding (CoNLL 2003 [2]), and Translation abilities (IWSLT14 [3])**. The experimental results are as follows:\n\n| Datasets           |  CONIL03 (P / R / F1) | WebQSP (F1 / Hits@1) | IWSLT14 (de-en / en-de) |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Single Domain (1/1)| 91.89 / 89.33 / 90.59 | 33.5 / 64.12         | 50 / 52                 |\n| Single Domain (1/2)| 90.59 / 87.15 / 88.83 | 27.10 / 61.87        | 46 / 43                 |\n| Single Domain (1/4)| 85.24 / 79.46 / 82.25 | 22.56 / 61.38        | 42 / 40                 |\n| Single Domain (1/8)| 63.22 / 60.42 / 61.79 | 13.63 / 49.05        | 41 / 40                 |\n|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Mixed Domains (1/1)| 91.74 / 87.79 / 89.72 | 32.10 / 63.70        | 46 / 49                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/2)| 90.69 / 86.93 / 88.77 | 29.98 / 62.29        | 45 / 45                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/4)| 88.81 / 85.62 / 87.18 | 25.42 / 58.02        | 43 / 43                 |\n| Mixed Domains (1/8)| 86.47 / 81.18 / 83.74 | 21.36 / 56.86        | 45 / 45                 |\n\n**Individual domain**\uff1aFor the language understanding (NER) task, the performance (P, R, F1) of the model shows a positive correlation with the scaling curve of the data. These two abilities exhibit a similar performance scaling trend as the mathematical ability discussed in RQ1. On the other hand, for world knowledge (WebQSP), it also shows a positive correlation trend. However, when the data ratio decreases from 1/4 to 1/8, there is a significant fluctuation in performance. In the case of translation, the performance trends for German-English and English-German translations are not entirely consistent. These findings further support the core conclusion of RQ1 that different data exhibit different scaling curves.\n\n**Mixed domains**: The findings align with the conclusions of RQ2 in mixed domains, which states that abilities are improved with low-resource and decreased with high-resource compared to individual source abilities. \n\nWe further evaluated the bias of the models by assessing Truthful QA. We used the sharegpt data as the training set for SFT and explored the experimental setup of scaling the data from 100% to 1/256. We aligned the experimental setup with the evaluation criteria of TruthfulQA [4][5].\n\n| Methods                          | TruthfulQA (Standard Zero-shot) | TruthfulQA (w. truthful Prompt) |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Single Domain (1/1)              | 23.6                            | 26.5                            |\n| Single Domain (1/4)              | 22.76                           | 26.19                           |\n| Single Domain (1/16)             | 24.96                           | 26.43                           |\n| Single Domain (1/64)             | 22.03                           | 25.43                           |\n| Single Domain (1/256)            | 23.6                            | 26.5                            |\n\nThe results indicate that the performance of lama-7B on TruthfulQA  did not show significant fluctuations. One possible reason for this is that the general ability data (sharegpt) may not enhance the abillity of debias. This will be a direction for future exploration.\n\nWe will make appropriate adjustments to the conclusion statements in my article, avoiding controversial points to prevent any misinterpretation of the claims. We will also continue to explore whether the current conclusions hold true in other domains in the future.\n\n\u30101\u3011WebQuestionsSP\uff1aA question answering dataset using Freebase as the knowledge base for qustion answering. \n\n\u30102\u3011CoNLL 2003\uff1aCoNLL-2003 is a named entity recognition dataset released as a part of CoNLL-2003 shared task: language-independent named entity recognition. \n\n\u30103\u3011IWSLT14: Evaluation Campaign featured three tracks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), spoken language translation (SLT), and machine translation (MT).\n\n\u30104\u3011Representation Engineering: A Top-Down Approach to AI Transparency\n\n\u30105\u3011Investigating Uncertainty Calibration of Aligned Language Models under the Multiple-Choice Setting"

                        "value": "**Q1:** The trend of k is indeed reliable. The inconsistency you mentioned seems to be referring to the increase of k from 0 to 1/256, which aligns with the conclusion of RQ2. As k increases from 0 to 1/256, a small amount of specialized data is mixed into the general ability data. This leads to a mutual benefit between general abilities and extremely low-resource specialized abilities, consistent with the conclusion of mutual benefit among different ability items under low-resource conditions in RQ2.\nHowever, as more specialized data is gradually introduced (k increasing from 1/256 to 1/1), the specialized abilities improve, but there is a gradual emergence of conflicting high-resource performance among different ability items (as observed in RQ2), ultimately resulting in a decline in general abilities.\n\n\n\n**Q2:** We acknowledge that incorporating code can enhance the generalization ability in other domains, as seen in the previous work. However, the key difference lies in the amount of code data used for SFT. In those studies, SFT was performed using code data with token counts exceeding 10 billion, allowing the models to capture transferable structured knowledge. In contrast, the token count of code data in our experiments is even less than 0.01 billion, which makes it challenging for large models to learn transferable knowledge. This significant difference in experimental setup accounts for the contrasting conclusions.\n\nIn our experiments, we find that the factors influencing code mixing are more related to the style, format, and distribution of inputs from different domains (RQ3). We also acknowledge that investigating the effects of large-scale data with diverse abilities will be a valuable direction for future research."

It seems very straightforward that adjusting the mixture will result in different capabilities on benchmarks, as well as the general rule of thumb that \"more data under proper learning set-up results in better performance.\" The authors did not attempt to give any theoretical analysis of what they have observed, which further weakens the novelty claim.\n3.

Typical instruction fine-tuning works deal with a fine-tuning budget of 1E18 - 5E21 FLOPs [1], how would that translate to the amount of compute used in this work (since it's not clearly indicated)? Suppose the actual range of compute budget being studied (e.g. 1/256 \"data amount\" to 1 \"data amount,\") is much less than the usual amount in the literature. How would one ascertain that the scaling capabilities would extrapolate?\n\n[1]: Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models"

We don't give a scaling law equation since we do not use the test losses to evaluate task performance. Chinchilla's law using losses versus model size and data amount cannot be easily transformed here since metric like MT-Bench is not a simple function can be determined by the test losses, it is unknown that the power law still exists using metric like MT-Bench. However, MT-Bench/Alpaca-Eval are useful for quickly understanding human alignment performance and should be researched.\n\nW2: Our core finding is during multi-task learning, multiple abilities exhibits improvement in low-resource and decline in high-resource. Using our method can relief the decline in high-resource. Our main method should be defined as training routine instead of data mixture which trains on specialized tasks first and multi-task trains on human alignment data with a little specialized tasks. This method is emprically useful for LLM practioner to build a human-aligned chatbot with specialized abilities.\n\nW3: Thank you for your suggestion, we will improve our written and update the manuscript later.\n\nQ1: Our experiment setting is focus on aligning a pre-trained model to a chat model which mostly requires training samples from 1000 (less is more alignment) to 100,000 (ShareGPT). So our investigated fine-tuning budget is proper for our object.\n\nEthics Concern: Thank you for your suggestion, we will change our method name."
