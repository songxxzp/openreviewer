The authors propose a topology-aware spatio-temporal embedding and a spatial relations-aware multi-head self-attention mechanism to facilitate the learning of latent representations for intimate interactions. Spatial relationships can be represented more efficiently by using a set of joint chains to represent body parts instead of the graph-based structure commonly used in recent work.The experimental results show that TOPOFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets. The authors also mentioned that they will further investigate applying the method to other related tasks such as interaction prediction."

By using the Gauss Linking Integral  to indicate proximity to body parts, minimizing the variation of the paired GLIs on successive frames, mutual penetration of body parts can be avoided.\n3.

The proposed module Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Embedding applies an MLP-based structure, of which the technical contribution is minor. The benefits of the proposed two modules Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Embedding and Spatial Relation-aware Multi-Headed Self Attention are unclear. What are the roles of each module? The authors claim both can capture the semantic information, then regarding the penetration, which design contributes to it?    \n3. Regarding the Ablation in experiments: Tables 4 and 5 show the \"drop-one-out\" results, I would also like to see \"incremental\" results by adding each component one by one. \n4.

The same issue happens with the numbers of serial chains and network layers.\n- It is still unclear why GLI is a better way to represent human motion although it is \u201cinspired by the success of using GLI as soft constraints in an optimization-based approach for generating collision-free close interactions\u201d. There is no theoretical analysis or mathematical proof.\n- Please be serious about using math. There are no explanations of the meaning of $S, A$ (Section 3.1) or $T, D$.\n- It is unclear how TPE and FPE work. More details would be better.\n- The first reference to Figure 1 is in Section 4.5. It does not make sense to put it as the first figure. It is unclear what the colors on top stand for. Which ones are highlights?\n- Figure 4 is confusing. As is shown in the ground truth, the starting of the tumbling motion of the cartwheel happens at 6/7 of the motion. MLP takes it at the first 10% while the proposed sr-RPE highlights 40% - 60%. Both of them failed to capture the correct position.\n- It will be good to know the impact of TPE and FPE individually.\n- Typos:\n    - I guess you mean \u201clearn\u201d when saying \u201ceffectively \u2018earn\u2019 the topological and proximal relationship\u201d.\n    - An extra dot in the last sentence of Section 3.3."
