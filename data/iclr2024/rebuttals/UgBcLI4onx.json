The number of such positive pairs is regularized with a constraint on the instance-wise similarity matrix. Sparse-CL is evaluated on various linear classification benchmarks such as CIFAR and ImageNet, and demonstrates competitive performance in similar setups compared to concurrent methods."

There is an underlying graph of connections between concepts and the contrastive loss does not take that into account, which is a good motivation for this work.\n\n2) The sparsity constraint is also a good idea. Indeed, discovering the graph might be very difficult and letting the system discover it with properly designed loss constraints seems to be a solution.\n\n3) The results on small datasets are promising and the method achieves a very good performance against competitors."

In practice, the \u201ccritical issues\u201d mentioned with SimSiam are not observed and I am not sure that it can be considered as a problem.\n\n2) The results on ImageNet are good on a comparable setting, but far from being impressive. For example, Swav is compared without multi-crop, which is part of the method. Moreover, recent breakthroughs with the transformer architecture lead to much better results than what is reported in the paper. DINO reported 75% linear evaluation accuracy in 2021 and DINOv2 best model is at 86% accuracy.\n\n3) Sparse-CL with lambda=0.0 performs 71.5% on Cifar-100, which is already better than every other method. How do you explain that ? Is the setup really comparable with other methods ?\n\n4) Explanation in paragraphs Input space and Representation space are redundant and should be independent of the choice of method, here MoCo style method. Maybe just say: $\\hat{W}$ is $W$ but in representation."

The goal of SSL is to learn generalizable representation rather than improve classification performance. Therefore, the soundness of this paper could be further improved by providing experimental results on other downstream tasks like kNN, semantic segmentation, and object detection.\n3.

                    "value": "1. Contrastive methods in self-supervised learning adopt instance discrimination as the pretext task, and the focus of this line of research (and most previous methods) is how to handle the positive and negative pairs, or the diagonal and off-diagonal entries in the IwS matrix, respectively. However, the authors claim that studying from the perspective of IwS provides a novel framework, which might not be true. In addition, the proposed method fails to deal with false positives, as there might be 0s in the diagonal of the IwS matrix due to semantic inconsistency caused by strong data augmentation. This scenario should be taken into consideration since this paper focuses on IwS.\n2. A theoretical analysis can be conducted to analyze the alignment and sparsity terms of Sparse CL loss. The InfoNCE loss, used in SimCLR, MoCo and other contrastive methods, can also be decomposed into two terms similar to the proposed loss. The authors should theoretically discuss the relationships between these losses to better demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. \n3. The paper could benefit from a broader evaluation on other tasks beyond classification to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed method. For example, the pretrained model can be transferred to object detection and segmentation tasks, which is commonly used to evaluate the performance of self-supervised learning methods. \n4. Minors: Fig.1(d) shows an all-one IwS matrix for Siamese methods, which is not appropriate, as this is only the situation of mode collapse and the Siamese methods have already addressed this problem. Fig.4 shows a binary 0/1 matrix of Sparse CL in representation space, while Eqn.3 computes a continuous similarity value between 0 and 1. How is the above conversion made?"
