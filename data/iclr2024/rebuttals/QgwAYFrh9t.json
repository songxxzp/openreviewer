More importantly, the used layer-by-layer training scheme makes such three-layer neural network degenerate to a composition of two kernel methods (random features). With weight decay, the loss function under two stages is strongly convex and smooth. Both problem setting and algorithm are totally far away from true three-layer neural networks or even two-layer neural networks.\n\n- The results cannot handle the over-parameterized regime, i.e., the results require the width $m_1 << n$. The derived results set $m_1$ and $n_1$ depending on $d$, and $m_1$ and $n$ should have different orders of $d$. Otherwise the bound will become vacuous. This is because there is one $O(\\sqrt{m/n})$ term in the convergence rate, deriving by Rademacher complexity for the random features model."

We address specific concerns of yours below.\n\n> \u201cThe model and problem setting are a bit over-claim\u2026Both problem setting and algorithm are totally far away from true three-layer neural networks or even two-layer neural networks.\u201d\n\n- Please refer to the global response for discussion on the architecture/algorithm. \n- We\u2019d like to emphasize a few additional points about our work. First, even though each stage of the algorithm is a kernel method, the overall algorithm is not a kernel method, and crucially can learn hierarchical polynomials of the form $h = g \\circ p$ with a much improved sample complexity. A major insight of our paper is thus that the sample complexity of learning $g \\circ p$ is the same as learning $p$, by first fitting the low-degree terms of $g \\circ p$ (which is approximately $p$, as proven in Lemma 2). Furthermore, this algorithm *can* be implemented by a three-layer neural network, demonstrating a mechanism by which three-layer networks *can* perform feature learning. These insights, along with the observation and also empirical evidence that a three-layer neural network can indeed implement this layerwise training procedure, has not appeared before in the literature and we believe is an interesting and important contribution.\n- Next, we note that guarantees for feature learning in three-layer neural networks are few and far between, and all such results we are aware of do make some modification to the algorithm/architecture. We still find our ResNet architecture and layerwise training algorithm to be realistic while demonstrating a general feature learning principle. Our new experiments demonstrate that when all the parameters are trained jointly, the network still performs feature learning to learn the hierarchical target.\n\n> \u201cThe results cannot handle the over-parameterized regime, i.e., the results require the width $m_1 \\ll n$.\u201d\n- We have updated our main theorem to handle arbitrary $m_1 \\ge d^k$. Since the first stage of the algorithm is a kernel method, the generalization bound should not depend on the width, and instead on the RKHS norm of the target. In the random feature setting, the RKHS norm is just the $L_2$ norm of $u^*$. Our initial proof was a bit loose, but we have refined our analysis so that by choosing the correct weight decay parameter $\\xi_1$, the sample complexity now scales with the RKHS norm of $p$, independent of the width $m_1$.\n\n>\u201cHow does the first inequality in Eq. (13) hold?\u201d\n\n- This inequality term should actually be an equality. This is because for $j\\neq l$, the two terms are independent because of the independence between $v_j$ and $v_l$, and furthermore mean zero, since $E_v[u(v)h_k(v^Tx)] = (\\mathcal{P}_kh)(x)$. Therefore, the cross terms are equal to zero.\n\nWe are happy to answer any more questions you may have, and we hope that if your concerns have been addressed you would consider raising your score."

In general, the paper is easy to read: the assumptions are presented in a clear manner, comparison with prior work is well-established and the contribution seems important in the field.\n\nAt a technical level, the authors essentially show that (i) during the first training phase, the NN implements kernel regression and essentially learns the underlying polynomial $p$ and (ii) during the second stage, the NN recovers the link function $g$. The main technical tool is that using the special structure assumed for the polynomials $p$ (Assumption 4), the paper provides an approximate version of Stein's Lemma (see Lemma 2), which can be used to show Item (i) from the above technical results.

One is $p(x) = x_1^3 + \\cdots + x_d^3$. Even though $p$ can be written as a sum of orthogonal components, it does not lie in the span of degree 3 Hermites (as there exists a linear term). Another example is $p(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i h_3(x \\cdot v_i)$ where $m > d$.\n- Assumption 4 simplifies the analysis, in particular the proof of Lemma 2, since orthogonality of the $v_i$ implies independence of each term and thus makes it easier to compute the projection. In general, we expect that by the universality principle general features will be close to Gaussian and thus a similar result will hold, but this is challenging to make rigorous. We will be sure to add discussion on this point to a revision of our paper.\n\n> \u201cDo you think similar results could be established for other continuous measures?\u201d\n- We believe the high level insights should be the same; however, we note that in the literature essentially all feature learning results require strong assumptions on the data distribution such as being Gaussian, uniform on the hypersphere, or uniform on the Boolean hypercube. We expect our results to translate to these simple distributions, but for more general distributions this question is still open for much simpler models such as single-index models (see for example (Bruna et al., 2023) for preliminary work in this direction)\n\nJoan Bruna, Loucas Pillaud-Vivien, Aaron Zweig.

We address specific concerns of yours below.\n\nPlease refer to the global response for discussion on the algorithm/architecture, and our new revision.\n\n> \u201cThe main weakness of the paper is the close relationship with previous works. Although a fair comparison is given, the works by [Allen-Zhu & Li, 2019;2020] and [Nichani et al. 2023] contain many of the key ideas in the manuscript.\u201d \n\nWe would like to emphasize that the major original insight of our paper is that the sample complexity of learning $g \\circ p$ is the same as learning $p$, by first fitting the low-degree terms of $g \\circ p$ (which is approximately $p$, as proven in Lemma 2). Furthermore, this algorithm can be implemented by a three-layer neural network, demonstrating a new mechanism by which three-layer networks can perform feature learning. We believe that this insight is both novel and interesting.\n\nTo compare to the specific prior works:\n- (Allen-Zhu & Li; 2019; 2020) considers a more restricted class of neural network, in which all activations are quadratic. Furthermore, they consider target functions of the form $h(x) = p + \\alpha g \\circ p$, where $\\alpha = o_d(1)$. As such, the learned feature $p$ already achieves vanishing test loss. Our setting is much more challenging, in that the learner must extract $p$ while only having access to $h = g \\circ p$; the learner must also fit $g$ in order to obtain vanishing test error. We emphasize here that our choice of link function $g$ is very general, while Allen-Zhu & Li; 2020 can only handle $g$ which are almost linear. Our insight that a three-layer neural network can indeed implement both of these steps while only having access to $h$ is indeed a novel contribution compared to this prior work. \n- Likewise, (Nichani et al., 2023) can only handle quadratic features, and for that setting obtains a suboptimal sample complexity ($d^4$). Our key contribution is that this general principle of hierarchical feature learning -- the sample complexity of learning $g \\circ p$ via a three-layer neural network is the same as learning $p$ -- holds for a broad class of hierarchical functions. A major technical innovation of our work is an extension of the \u201capproximate Stein\u2019s lemma\u201d argument to handle degree $k$ polynomials.\n\nTo address the questions:\n- \u201cWhat is the original condition on L?\u201d It\u2019s $L=\\Theta(d)$. \n- \u201cCould the author comment with references characterizing the failure of two-layer networks in learning these high-rank target functions?\u201d Existing guarantees for two-layer neural networks fall in two rough categories. One set of results uses NTK style arguments; while these can handle high-rank target functions, their sample complexity is no better than a kernel method. On the other hand, feature learning guarantees like [Damian et al., 2022; Abbe et al., 2022; 2023] which do improve over kernel methods require the target to be low rank. While no general lower bound against two-layer networks learning high rank functions exists, approximation lower bounds have been proven against specific high-rank targets: see for instance [Daniely, 2017; Safran et al. 2019; Safran & Lee, 2022; Nichani et al., 2023]. We will update the exposition to make this point more clear.\n- \u201cCould the author comment on the requirements for the gradient step size in the first phase?\u201d We need the learning rate to be small enough to mimic gradient flow -- $\\eta < 1/\\ell$, where $\\ell $ is the smoothness of the loss. This is a different mechanism to [Nichani et al., 2023], which requires a very large gradient step that scales inversely to the initialization size. We believe our algorithm better captures practice, where smaller gradient steps to mimic gradient flow are more common. This distinction is another point of novelty of our work as compared to [Nichani et al., 2023].\n- We will be sure to add additional discussion on [Ben Arous et al., 2021], compare to two-layer networks after Corollary 1, and mention the $n = d^k$ requirement before Lemma 1.\n\nWe are happy to answer any more questions you may have, and we hope that if your concerns have been addressed you would consider raising your score.\n\nAmit Daniely.

They consider a specific 3 layer neural network with a skip connection and a bottleneck layer of size 1. They show, using layer-wise training that $O(d^k)$ samples are sufficient to train the second layer weights and $O(1)$ samples are sufficient to train the last layer weights. In particular, the total sample complexity $O(d^{k})$ is much smaller than $O(d^{kp})$ required for inner-product kernels. Note also that information theoretically, $\\Omega(d^k)$ is information theoretically minimal to learn degree-$k$ polynomials, however they only consider a particular subset of polynomials that has much smaller functional space dimension (except for $k=2$)."

It is unclear how this paper contributes in terms of novel ideas in that direction.\n- Overall, the architecture choice and algorithm makes the analysis straightforward. It reduces the problem to sequentially fitting two linear random feature models, which is by now quite well understood. See for example [Generalization error of random feature and kernel methods: Hypercontractivity and kernel matrix concentration, Mei et al., 2022] which gives the sample size and network width $\\Theta(d^k)$ to learn any degree-$k$ polynomials (for spherical data). The main technical innovation is Lemma 2, which relies on the specific construction of assumption 4. \n- For these reasons, I wonder how much this analysis can be generalized to other settings. Especially, in more realistic settings, we expect a non-linear evolution of the parameters, which this paper avoids using their specific architecture. In contrast, while [Nichani et al., 23] only considers one step size (so ultimately also a linear model step), they use a more standard architecture (but get a worse sample complexity dependency)."
