The proposed method consists of a \u201cpredictor\u201d and an \u201cadversary\u201d working as follows. The predictor model estimates the target label from non-sensitive features. The adversary model estimates the sensitive attribute based on the predictor's output. This paper propose a loss function that adjusts the predictor model such that it learns the primary task well without dependence on sensitive attributes."

                    "value": "1- The contributions of this paper are limited as the proposed method is a straightforward combination of three existing works:\n1) Adversarial debiasing  Zhang et al. (2018) that encourages the model to learn domain-invariant features by minimizing the success of an adversarial component that aims to predict sensitive attributes;\n2) Fairness algorithms using differential privacy Jagielski et al. (2019) that injects DP into existing fairness algorithms;\n3) Kang et al. (2022) that extends adversarial debiasing techniques to multiple sensitive attributes\n\nIn particular, this paper combines the above existing methods to i) debias multiple sensitive attributes; and ii) extend the privacy guarantees to all attributes as opposed to only sensitive attributes. I acknowledge and appreciate authors being honest on this front though.\n\n2- Lack of fairness guarantees. It seems that the proposed method does not satisfy any fairness guarantees, it just minimizes the ability of a particular adversary model to predict sensitive attributes. This limitation is inherited from adversarial methods which cannot guarantee protection against other models than the one considered. \n\n3- Inconsistent and surprising results. After looking at Tables 2-4, the performance of DP and DP+bias is not intuitive to me:\n1) Table 2 and Table 3 show that DP + Debias method achieves better performance than than DP method. This is surprising. \n2) However, Table 4 shows that DP + Debias achieves worse performance than DP method. Although this is expected, this is not consistent with the results of other datasets in Table 2 and Table 3. \n\n4- Shallow discussion of results. I would appreciate it if authors could analyse their results, this could help to shed light on the above #3 concern.\n\n5- Some ambiguity in the algorithm and the proposed method. \n1) Is line 10 and 14 in algorithm 1 are done per-example? If not, how this follow the requirements of satisfying DP guarantees? \n2) The description of the projection part is missing therefore it is hard to understand why this projection does not break DP guarantees.\n\n6- Experimental choices including hyperparameters and privacy budgets are not justified/studied. For example how sensitive the performance of the proposed method is to the value of the hyperparameter introduced by the proposed loss function. \n\n7- Overclaims. The abstract claims that the proposed method meets various fairness criteria. However, I can see only results of Equality of Odds and I think Section 2.1 confirms my concern as it says \"In the current work, we adopt Equality of Odds (Hardt et al., 2016) as a definition of fairness\". Section 4.5 also highlights that only Equality of Odds is considered for the evaluation.  \n\n8- High computational costs. I would report computational costs to see the effect of the proposed method on the computational costs. If I understand correctly the proposed method computes per-example gradient for both predictor and adversary model, so I would expect an increase in the computational costs. \n\n9- Figure 1 is not referred in the text.\n\n10- Lack of empirical comparisons with existing DP+fairness works. \n\n11- Unclear assumptions. For example, I would highlight/justify that this paper only considers group fairness and not individual fairness and a motivation for it."

The approach is based on adversarial debiasing: while the main model is learning to predict the labels, an adversarial model tries to predict the sensitive attributes given access to the final layer outputs of the main model. The main model is then jointly trained also to minimize the success of the adversarial model, which encourages the learned model to be less dependent on the sensitive features. In the current paper, adversarial debiasing is combined with other techniques: fairness and privacy (from Jagielski et al. 2019) and multi-attribute debiasing (from Kang et al. 2022)."

While there is a comment on why large epsilons are acceptable, I do not agree with the sentiment that this is generally okay because someone uses even bigger values.\n\n4) Sec. 4.5: provide at least some description of the metrics used.\n\n5) Sec.4.5: can you clarify where you enforce EoD in the proposed method?\n\n6) Contrary to what is stated Sec.6.2 on reproducibility, there does not seem to be any supplementary material provided?\n\n7) Sec.6, Modularity of DP: \"This ensures both unbiased learning and individual data protection\". Do you actually have some guarantees beyond empirical results showing that debiasing approach used guarantees some given amount of fairness?\n\n8) Please define the neighbourhood relation explicitly in defining DP.\n\n\n### Smaller comments, typos etc (do not require comments):\n\ni) Sec.3, on Jagielski et al. only noising the Auditor: note that Jagielski et al. assume that the Learner does not have access to the sensitive feature, and since the other features are assumed public, adding DP on those is not necessary. Please fix the claim to clearly state that you have differing settings.\n\nii) Note that delta in DP is only roughly the maximum catastrophic failure probability.\n\niii) Sec 2.2 end: moments accountant, and any other privacy accounting method based on Renyi DP, is at least a bit loose in approximate DP space (see e.g. Zhu et al. 2019).\n\niv) End of Sec.6.1: missing ref?\n\nReferences:\nYaghini et al. 2023: Learning with Impartiality to Walk on the Pareto Frontier of Fairness, Privacy, and Utility.\nZhu et al. 2019: Optimal Accounting of Differential Privacy via Characteristic Function."

The patterns on the experimental results seem consistent between the two tabular datasets (Adult and COMPAS), but then things take a mysterious left turn at the hate speech dataset. Is there an explanation for why debiasing improves the performance against the non-private baseline for the hate speech dataset, but debiasing + DP hurts the performance against DP-only? And why this would be the opposite for the other two datasets (where debiasing helps in the private setting but hurts in the non-private setting)?\n\nMinor comments:\n1. The conclusion alludes to four datasets, but I only count three?\n2. Some potential typos:\n    1. \u201cDebasing\u201d in the caption of Figure 1\n    2. \u201cfollowing advantages: reasons:\u201d in Section 6\n    3. undefined reference \u201c??\u201d at the very end of Section 6.1"
