                    "value": "The paper presents a strategy to achieve perfect equivariance in convolutional neural networks. That is, the model produces exactly the same output when the input image is shifted horizontally or vertically. This is achieved by preserving statistics of the positions of the downsampling process in the pooling layers of convolutional networks. The results indicate that the method works perfectly for downsampling (classification) and upsampling (segmentation) operations without the need to re-train the models."

                    "value": "Main comments:\n\n* Equivariance is demonstrated only for inference (test) time. It is unclear how the method would facilitate equivariance during training. In other words, by implementing MASS in all pooling layers, what augmentations would be unnecessary when training a new model? The only experiments that involved training a model from scratch were conducted with the CIFAR dataset, but the augmentation procedure was not explained. More analysis of equivariance during training would be informative.\n* In general, the explanation of the method has a few gaps that could be better presented and clarified. For instance, the paper indicates that previous work ignores classical sampling theory, but how MASS uses classical sampling theory is not explained later. Also, it is unclear what the authors mean by \"MASS meticulously preserves the initial downsampling process\". The introduction indicates that MASS uses input data statistics to select the origin, but these statistics are not clearly defined later. The procedure could be more formally presented to avoid confusions.\n* The paper mentions that non-equivariant methods can display severe accuracy drops, but this does not seem to be reflected in the results. The consistency of other methods is usually above 80% and the classification rate remains high. If shifts are introduced randomly, the accuracy of a non-equivariant method can change every time. Reporting how the results change with the amount of shift introduced to break the classification of a model would be informative.\n\nOther comments:\n* It is unclear if the method results in computing or memory overhead (even if minimal, what additional operations / variables are added compared to regular pooling).\n* Some acronyms are not clearly defined, such as APS, LPF and DDAC. Table 2 uses them extensively without citations or explanations to what they refer to exactly.\n* Some minor typos: equivaiant, \"architectures.architectures\", experimants, inializing."

                    "value": "- The method and presentation.\n\nIn this work, although the authors addresses a fundamental research problem, how to preserve shift-equivariance property for convolutional neural networks, the proposed method called MASS is rather incremental, lacking new tech insights. To the best of my knowledge, MASS is merely a simple modification of existing work APS (adaptive polyphase sampling) proposed by Anadi Chaman and Ivan Dokmani\u0107 in their CVPR 2021 paper. Specifically, the authors use a pre-defined selection function for determining the origin with ASP which can accurately fit circular shift operations over the input image sample.  Generally, I have not seen any insightful differences against APS. \n\nThe presentation of the method is poor: 1) usually no explanations for notations and terms appeared in formulas; 2) no explanations/details on the formulation of the proposed MASS; 3) rather coarse descriptions for Figure 1 and Figure 2; 4) some sub-figures are wrong, e.g., two sub-figures for MASS in channel 1 of Figure 1 are not consistent to the others.\n    \nThe writing of the paper is also poor. Please see my comments in \"Others\" part for details.\n\n- The limitations.\n\nThe authors did not discuss on the limitations of the proposed method.\n\n- The experiments.\n\nNote that the authors claim that the pre-defined selection function for determining the origin can accurately fit the shift operation. However, the authors did not provide any details on how to implement it in experiments. This makes experimental comparison confusing. \n\nComparison is limited to APS.\n\nExperiments are not convincing. On CIFAR-10 dataset, the proposed MASS brings very marginal gains to APS. On PASCAL VOC dataset, MASS performs worse than APS. However, on ImageNet-1K dataset, MASS is much better than APS. What are the root reasons? \n\nThere is no ablation to study how does the proposed method MASS work. \n\nHow about the performance of MASS under other shift operations to the input image sample instead of circular shift operations?\n\n- Others.\n\nThe writing can be improved significantly. There exist numerous typos, grammar errors and inaccurate descriptions throughout the whole paper. Here, I just list some example errors in the \"Related Works\" section:\n\n1. \"Cheng et al.,2016; ?\" -> an inaccurate citation;\n2. \"a lack of shift equivariance occur\" -> \"a lack of shift equivariance **occurs**\";\n3. \"While careful augmentation strategies substantailly improves\" -> \"While careful augmentation strategies **substantially improve**\";\n4. \"Another line of research is to apply anti-aliasing low-pass filter, which originate\" -> \"Another line of research is to apply anti-aliasing low-pass filter, which **originates**\";\n5. \"This anti-aliasing concepts are\" -> \"This anti-aliasing **concept is**\";\n6. \"The first absolute shift-invariant method for image classification tasks are proposed \" -> \"The first absolute shift-invariant method for image classification tasks **is** proposed\";\n7. \"While the selection of the polyphase components of APS is based on the l2 norm, learnable polyphase sampling (LPS) generalize to select\" -> \"While the selection of the polyphase components of APS is based on the l2 norm, learnable polyphase sampling (LPS) **is generalized** to select\";\n8.

Maybe if I read this paper 2 or 3 times, I will eventually understand what color schemes imply in Figures 1,2,4. But I want to be able to understand this from the first glance. Figures should serve the purpose of clarifying things and not making them more obscure. Without the explanation of what colors are supposed to signify and explain in the figures - it is impossible to quickly understand what they are supposed to clarify.\n- The compelling motivation for shift equivariance is not supported by problem specific datasets. All experiments are done on generic datasets. CIFAR-10 does not seem to fit the motivation at all with its 32x32 images. It seems like a misfit for the purpose of the paper. I expect that the industrial applications involve high-resolution imagery. If authors can provide results on high-resolution datasets, especially from the industrial domain this will make the results a lot more compelling. There is a recent dataset described here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06673.pdf. I am sure that more search will reveal more datasets like this. I remember encountering similar problems on kaggle.\n- Consistency metric defined in equation (4) does not make any sense to me. What does it measure, what is x and y? Is it pointwise pixel match, if so, why there is no summation over pixels? One of the closing brakets is missing.\n- Baselines used in experimental tables are not explained well. As a result, the experiments do not seem persuasive\n    - What is the reference for DDAC and LPF?\n    - Why LPS is not included in Tables 2,3?\n    - Why Table 3 does not contain same baselines as Table 2? It seems that a few of the baselines in Table 2 are very effective. It may well be that APS with enhancements presented in Table 3 might be as effective or better than MASS?\n- Results in Table 2 are marginal and statistically insignificant. To me, the value of this result is approaching 0, because most confidence intervals overlap. It does not make sense to use bold font to signify the best model, when the best model is not significantly different than another model.\n- From Tables 2-4, I do not see a decisive value of the proposed approach with respect to other approaches such as LPS-DDAC-3 or ASP-DDAC-3. Why do we need this approach, what is the value?\n- I am not sure I see value in using the pretrained version of any of the approaches discussed in the experimental section. What is the point, can you explain in detail the actual use case? When the networks are fine-tuned properly, many of them achieve very similar results.\n- Table 5 confirms previous concerns."
