A more detailed explanation or elaboration of the experimental results would greatly enhance the overall comprehensibility of this section.\n\nAnswer. We would be happy to answer any specific questions. Since the proposed invariants are the first to be proved complete and Lipschitz continuous for Euclidean graphs, all experiments are completely new, not incremental improvements over any past work.  \n\nBriefly, the first part (Table 1) reports hundreds of near-duplicates in QM9 that were never reported because there was no continuous metric. It is important to filter out these near-duplicates for any experiments on QM9, especially those that have too different properties. Indeed, it is physically impossible to change a molecule by a tiny amount and observe a large change in property. At least it's important to know all such cases to continuously quantify the Structure-Property Relationships, see new Problem 2.1.    \n\nSecond, Figure 6 and Table 2 report the first ever Lipschitz constants for the known properties relative to the first metric (SBM on SCDs) between rigid graphs and to the distances (L_inf and Earth Mover's Distance) on the simpler (incomplete) invariants SDV and PDD. \n\nQuestion. In addition, the descriptors do not scale effectively with the dimensionality of the Euclidean space\n\nAnswer. Quote from page 1: \"The most practical cases are the low dimensions n = 2, 3, 4, while the number m of vertices can be much larger. Our main application is for molecular graphs in R^3\". \n\nYou are right that it would be great to also have a polynomial dependence on dimension. However, there were *no metrics at all* that were computable in polynomial time in the number m of points even for a fixed dimension (even in the plane for n=2).\n\nQuestion. Do not consider node or edge attributes, potentially overlooking crucial information in real-world applications where such attributes play a significant role.\n\nAnswer. Quote right under Figure 5: \"Any metrics on vertex attributes and weights can be incorporated into metrics on the invariants below. To make the key concepts clearer, the main paper introduces all invariants for unordered vertices without attributes and only for sign weight\".\n\nMore importantly, the first ever duplicate analysis of QM9 in Table 1 shows that all molecules can be distinguished only by their vertex positions and presence/absence of bonds even without any atomic types. \n\nThis experiment reflects our basic physical intuition because we cannot replace one atom by different one without changing geometry. However, this principle was impossible to verify without complete invariants with continuous metrics. \n\nComment. these descriptors can only be utilized by models incorporating some sort of permutation invariance, as they require a \"subrepresentation\" for each possible permutation of the nodes.\n\nAnswer. A simple way to guarantee permutation invariance is to convert any unordered set of numbers a_1,...,a_m into their moments: the average (a_1+...+a_m)/m, the standard deviation, and so on. Any set can be reconstructed (up to permutation) from such symmetric polynomials from m moments, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_polynomial   \n\nQuestion. in Table 2, what does SPF stand for?\n\nAnswer. SPF stands for Structure-Property Factor. This is the Lipschitz constant in front the of the metric needed to quantify a difference in property, see the caption of Table 2. \n  \nQuestion. Lemma C.2 explicitly states that given the OCD descriptor, the Euclidean graph can be reconstructed up to isometry. However, I could not find a similar result for the SDD descriptor. \n\nAnswer. Yes, the Simplexwise Distance Distribution (SDD) is for any metric (not necessarily Euclidean) space. The reconstruction is proved for invariants (OCD, SCD) in section 4 for Euclidean space. The letter C refers to the center of mass, which is defined by the linear combination of given points, hence makes sense only in a vector space. \n \nQuestion. Does this mean the same principle does not apply to SDD? If that's the case, could you provide the reason for this difference? Analogously, it is conjectured that the SDD descriptor achieves completeness for in contrast to the OCD descriptor, which has been proven. What specific factors contribute to the absence of a proof for the SDD descriptor?  \n\nAnswer. Yes, you are right that the Euclidean structure was essentially used for completeness and reconstruction. For example, the position of any point in R^3 is determined by 3 distance to other 3 fixed points (not in the same line) and a sign. In an arbitrary non-Euclidean space, there is no similar rigidity of positions with respect to distances. We conjecture that SDD of a high enough order is complete in any metric space, so this problem is left for future research.\n\nWe will reply to the remaining question in the second part below."

                        "value": "Thank you for the explanation. Some points are clearer now, however I still have some doubts regarding the figures.\n\nRegarding Figure 6: If the horizontal axis represents the metric value between two points, how do I interpret the energy of a pair of points. Is the difference of the energy values? What does exactly represent the green line in Figure 6? You mention that in the first plot the energy rapidly changes with respect to the the L_infinity distance, while for the other metrics this is not the case. However, I can not identify such patterns from the scatter plots. Should the green lines aid to detect the rapid change? What I can detect, is that for the first plot, more points concentrate in the bottom right corner of the plot, meaning that there pairs of points that are farther to each other with respect to the L1_infinite distance, yet with similar free-energy (asuming the energy of a pair of point is the difference of their energies) . This pattern is not as prominent for the other metrics. Why should this be related with a rapid change? I find difficult to interprete correctly these plots, as I have the impression that I am misunderstanding something.\n\n\nRegarding table 2: Is the SPF value equivalent to the slope of the green line in Figure 6? Analogously is SPD the distance at which the slope suddenly changes? How should be this change of slope interpreted? Also, why is there such a discrepancy for the values of the energy U0? The  SPF and SPD values of the L_infinity and SBM columns are similar, but the ones of the EMD column are totally different. If my understanding is correct, it seems as the EMD is the best metric since their slopes are lower? Is that so?\n\nRegarding the permutation invariance: I do not think the permutation invariance can be solved by the computation of the moments. The SDD and SCD descriptors are formed by sets of pairs of matrices. Each pair of matrices is determined by a h-vertex subset A of V(G). Depending on the order of the h-vertex subset, the associated pait of matrix will also change the order of its entries. Thus, in order to process efficiently each pair of matrices, one needs to be permutation invariant."

Several paragraphs after Problem 1.1 discussed all the conditions as a basic minimum for any data objects (instead of graphs) and equivalence (instead of isometry). So Problem 1.1 provides a well-justified target for data science far beyond molecules.\n\nQuestion. My background is in combinatorial/algebraic graph algorithms, so am accustomed to features based on eigenvalues. Are there graphs with same/similar list of eigenvalues where the invariants introduced here differ?\n\nAnswer. Yes, three eigenvalues of any point cloud in Euclidean 3-dimensional space are easy isometry invariants. These three numbers are very far from being complete descriptors of arbitrary point clouds. However, next week we can produce analogs of Figure 7 by using three eigenvalues and also list pairs of molecules with almost identical eigenvalues.\n\nWe are happy to answer more questions. Thank you."

Li et al]\n\n\nLocal remarks and suggestions regarding writing (no need to address in rebuttal):\n* Last paragraph in page 2 is confusing I would rephrase\n* In the past work section: Why do you say Problem 1.1 is much simpler? The explanation gives is that there is an  algorithm with exponential complexity to solve the problem (note also this algorithm has issues when there are eigenvalue multipliciities)\n* There are two  things which seem to me make the presentation unnecessarily too complicated (this is not essential). Firstly, why do you decide to have a (n-1) by (n-1) distance matrix instead of n by n like the rest of the world uses? It makes the notation cumbersume. Secondly, why do you bother to lexicographically sort things when later you will define a permutation invariant distance? You can just store things in an arbitrary order.\n* I think the first paragraph is Section 5 is unnecessarily aggressive. Firstly, I didn't attend Isabelle Guyon's talk but I would guess the remark you are quoting was made half-jestingly. Secondly, experiments on QM9 use the standard train/test paradigm and results are evaluated on the test. This is a reasonable and standard practice. The limitations of this practice regarding generalizing to out of distribution data are also known. Since you are not addressing these issues in the experiments I don't see why you need to bring up the whole issue. Just say what your experiments are. \n* Page 12 just before the beginning of the appendix there is a paragraph which maybe is misplaced?"

                        "value": "Question. Regarding the proof of completeness in Lemma C.2 part (c). Say you have two points p,p' which are both not in A. How would you know if there is an edge between them from the matrices D(A \\cup 0) and M(G;A \\cup 0)?\n\nAnswer. The last two lines in the proof of Lemma C.2(c) say that \"The presence (or absence) of an edge between any p, q in V (G) is determined by the sign +1 (or \u22121, respectively) of each distance dG(p,q) in the matrices D(A union {0}) and M(G; A union {0})\". \n\nBy Definition 3.3 all distance in the matrices D and M are *G-based* and denoted by d_G(p,q). This notation was introduced before Definition 3.1: \n\n\"To make the key concepts clearer, the main paper introduces all invariants for unordered vertices without attributes and only for sign weights: w[p, q] = +1 if the vertices p, q are connected by an edge of G, otherwise w[p, q] = \u22121. Let dG(p, q) denote any G-based distance between p, q in V (G). We can take the signed distance w[p, q]d(p, q)\".\n\nSo, any distance in all matrices has a sign: +1 means an edge, -1 means no edge.\n\nQuestion. Where in your proof do you need straight non-intersecting edges?\n\nAnswer. You are right that the condition on non-intersecting edges is superfluous. We need only a combinatorial edge given by a pair of points. The condition of a straight edge is needed only to draw a straight line. Without this condition, the reconstruction produces positions of all vertices (up to rigid motion) and indicators which vertices should be connected.\n\nQuestion. Also is this assumption always valid in chemistry? If so could you explain / give reference?\n\nAnswer. Yes, molecules are often represented by atoms connected by straight chemical bonds. We can add the reference to the book \"Chemical graph theory: introduction and fundamentals\" by D Bonchev, 1991. Our edges are represented by abstract yes/no links.\n\nQuestion. Can you explain in more detail what problem 2.1 is? Is this a problem you solve in this paper?\n\nAnswer. Problem 2.1 is the first formulation (to the best of our knowledge) of the continuous version of the Structure-Property Hypothesis (SPR). The original SPR informally says that \"a structure determines all properties\". In the mathematical language, if two structures are rigidly equivalent, they should have same properties. In this exact formulation, the last statement is rather trivial. \n\nHowever, any real structures cannot be exactly equivalent, they always differ by some noise in measurements. Hence the state the continuous (practical) version of the SPR hypothesis as Problem 2.1: briefly, how close should be two structures (in terms of a metric between rigid classes) to guarantee that they have similar properties? More exactly, determine the Lipschitz constant of a property relative to perturbations of a structure.\n\nSince there was no metric on rigid classes of Euclidean graphs, Problem 2.1 made no sense. Indeed, if the first axiom fails, we have two non-equivalent graphs G,H with potentially different properties but d(G,H)=0, so the property is discontinuous with respect to this d.\nIndeed, the distance d sees no difference between G,H but their properties can differ!  \n\nNow, after complete invariants with Lipschitz continuous metrics are finally found, Problem 2.1 opens doors to rigorous investigations of the property landscapes on a continuous and complete invariant-based map, which was started in section 5.\n\nQuestion. What is the `main paper'? There is only one paper. How are these definitions related to the definitions above when you defined IGS and RGS?\n\nAnswer. The words `main paper' referred to the 9-page main part before the references. Definition 3.1 reminds about the simpler (incomplete) invariants for the ablation study in section 5. The spaces RGS and IGS require complete invariants (SCD) in Definition 4.1.  \n\nComment. A paper you could consider adding to your refs: [Is Distance Matrix Enough for Geometric Deep Learning? Li et al]\n\nAnswer. Thank you for your helpful reference, which we will certainly add. The distance matrix can be used when all given points (or vertices in a graph have distinct labels or indices). This case of ordered points was also discussed in paragraph 2 on page 4.\n\nQuestion. In the past work section: Why do you say Problem 1.1 is much simpler? \n\nAnswer. The full quote is \"Problem 1.1 is much simpler for a cloud C of m unordered points when a graph has only isolated vertices and no edges.\" \n\nIndeed, there are m(m-1)/2 potential edges between m points. Hence, for a fixed set of vertices in R^n, there are exponentially many non-isometric graphs on these fixed m vertices (even if we consider potential symmetries), so edges add a lot of complexity to a point cloud.\n\nFurther questions are answered in the second part below because of the character limit."

When we read the motivations of the paper, we expect the graphs considered to have a large number of vertices, which could exclude some algorithms from the literature.\n\nAnswer. The abstract talks about applications to molecular graphs from QM9, which contains 130K+ molecules of up to 29 atoms each.\n \nComment. If the complexities are indeed polynomial, the method may turn out to be too slow for large graphs with a term in in Theorem 4.4 (in dimension 3).\n\nAnswer. The new invariant SCD is the final in the hierarchy of the simpler and faster invariants SDV and PDD. The experiments in section 5 apply these three invariants in the hierarchical way, first rough separation by SDV, then finer distribution by PDD and the final and definite answer about duplication and proper metric by the complete invariant SCD.\n \nComment. The application considered in the numerical part actually deals only with small graphs for which many other methods (even with worse complexities) could be employed. \n\nAnswer. The detailed review of related work in section 2 thoroughly described that all past methods didn't solve full Problem 1.1. If we accidentally missed any specific references, please let us know and we would be happy to include them.\n\nComment. For the example considered in the paper (where other algorithms could be applied) and for application to larger graphs (where the time complexity could be too bad).\n\nAnswer. The completeness and Lipschitz continuity are more important than computability due to the faster invariants SDV and PDD similarly based on inter-atomic distances. \n\nComment. In addition, I think it is a good point to control descriptor variations, but limiting them to a single vertex seems restrictive: in real data, all the vertices are subject to noise. The result obtained is interesting but should be generalized to metrics that take into account all the vertices of the graph.\n\nAnswer. In Theorem 3.4(c) and 4.4(c) the words \"perturbing any vertex\" meant \"perturbing each vertex\" (all vertices, not a single one). \n\nComment.the paper lacks a numerical section that illustrates the algorithm's behavior on synthetic graphs of varying size, both in terms of computation time and robustness to noise, with comparisons with others methods from the literature, e.g. graph distances or kernels).\n\nAnswer. The algorithm's behavior with respect to size and robustness to noise were theoretically proved for all graphs. One can ask for synthetic experiments when there are no theoretical proofs. However, we have completed this stage with 100% guarantees and considered only real data such as 130K+ molecules from QM9.\n\nQuestion. From my point of view, a numerical part with computation times should illustrate the theoretical results of complexity to highlight which size of graph can be handled by the proposed descriptors. Do the authors have an answer to this point?\n\nAnswer. Ok, next week we'll run extra experiments on random graphs with a growing number of vertices.\n\nQuestion. I do not understand the role of h in section 3 and more precisely in Theorem 3.4. To minimize complexity, we want to take h=1, but is the descriptor still relevant (in relation with the remark at the end of page 6)? \n\nAnswer. This parameter is more relevant for general metric spaces. Yes, SDD for h=1 is the past invariant PDD, SDD for h=2 is a stronger invariant, SDD for h=3 is even stronger and so on. In Euclidean space, Theorem 4.4 proves that h=n-1 provides a complete invariant in R^n.\n\nQuestion. How h is selected and what happens to complexity in that case? \n\nAnswer. h=1 gives the strong invariant PDD. h=2 gives SDD that distinguished all known counter-examples to the past invariants in R^3. All complexities explicitly include h. \n\nQuestion. In the same vein, what is the exact role of l and how should it be selected, both in Theorems 3.4 and 4.4? Is it a way to control the time complexity?\n\nAnswer. The parameter l is determined in Theorem 3.4(c) as the size (number of non-equivalent sets) and has the explicit upper bound in terms of m and n (or h), see \"let SDD(G; h) and SDD(G\u2032; h) have a maximum size l\", similarly in Theorem 4.4(c), .\n\nQuestion. How were these two parameters selected in the numerical section of the paper?\n\nAnswer. Molecular graphs are in R^3, so n=3. Then h=n-1=2 for the SCD invariant.\n\nWe are happy to answer any more questions."

                        "value": "Comment. Scalability & Approximation: While this is a pioneering effort for complete invariance in graphs, to be applicable to a much broader application class the question of scalability is crucial. Graphs typically comprise thousands or millions of nodes. \n\nAnswer. The abstract emphasized twice that the key target application is for molecular graphs. The mentioned database QM9 consists of 130K+ molecules that have up to 29 atoms.\n\nComment. Having a polynomial complexity on the nodes makes it harder to execute. To this end, would the authors think of some approximations that could be possible? or as a reverse question can comment on the impossibility of such a scenario?\n\nAnswer. Approximations are always possible. The weaker (but generically complete) invariant PDD (Pointwise Distance Distribution) has a near-linear time in the number k of neighbors.\n\nThese k nearest neighbors can be computed by a fast nearest neighbor search in any metric space, see the latest results in Elkin et al \"A new near-linear time algorithm for k-nearest neighbor search using a compressed cover tree\" (ICML 2023).\n\nComment. Other graph types: I am assuming the graphs in the paper are undirected and consist of an edge weight of 1. Can the theory developed extend easily to weighted and/or undirected graphs? What would be the challenges in doing so?\n\nAnswer. The edges are undirected but lengths of edges can be arbitrary. Section 3 defines strong invariants SDD (Simplexwise Distance Distribution) for finite graphs in any metric space (or weighted undirected graphs in your words). For example, a graph can be built on any finite set of vertices with the shortest path metric for any positive lengths of edges.\n\nQuestion. Robustness to noise: This is a minor point, but is there some theoretical result possible on the tolerance to outliers or Gaussian noise levels? \n\nAnswer. Since our target application was for molecular graphs, the bounded noise is justified by small atomic vibrations, so atoms are real physical objects that cannot disappear (as outliers) or appear from \"thin air\". However, Problem 1.1 makes sense for any other data objects (instead of graphs) and equivalences (instead of isometry or rigid motion). If we consider graphs with outliers (vertices or edges), the first step is to define a suitable equivalence relation. After that Problem 1.1 will make sense.\n\nWe are happy to answer any other questions."
