Pensieve failed to do so, and Puffer show it in their paper.\n2. Altough it may seem the performance does not improves a lot, for network purposes this actullay means a lot - every sub QoE is hard to improve because in the streaming environment there are many types of clients and the algorithm needs to take in account every one of them to succeed in the total task. Meaning it's easy to handcraft an algorithm that optimize for one client but hard to generalize.\n3. The interesting part is in the range of <12 Mb/s for our video, over than that it becomes a trivial task - always send the max quality with zero time rebufferring."

The authors stated that:\n\u201cMPC optimization occurs online, and so setting the look-ahead window to be too far into the future can be associated with prohibitively expensive computational burden and time. \u201c\nThis statement doesn't align with my perspective. To illustrate, in Pensieve (Sigcomm 2017), the look-ahead window comprises only a single predicted or estimated input to the RL agent, which serves as an approximation for solving the optimization problem. Furthermore, in practical terms, it's essential to keep the window size relatively small. As the window size increases, the accuracy of predictions tends to decrease.\n\nMoreover, they stated that:\n\u201cIn this study, we revisit ABR policy learning. We present a simple ABR scheme, called \u201cWolfi\u201d2. Wolfi applies deep-Q-learning to the exact same inputs required for MPC\u2019s online optimization process, thus replacing MPC optimization with policy learning. \u201c\nYet, this is precisely the approach adopted in Pensieve (Sigcomm 2017): approximating the solution to the online MPC optimization problem using a reinforcement learning agent. The question then arises, how does this current work distinguish itself from the research conducted five years ago?\n\nThe authors have also put forth the following claim: \n\u201cSolve an exact optimization problem to determine the sequence of bitrates that maximizes a QoE objective (of the above form) with respect to the predicted download times.\u201d\nHowever, I contend that, in most cases, it is not necessary to find a solution to the precise optimization problem. Numerous algorithms have tackled simplified variants of the original problem or introduced heuristics that have demonstrated strong performance. In fact, in FastScan (published in IEEE Transactions in Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 2019), a low-complexity algorithm was introduced to solve the exact problem. The formulation they utilized is identical to the one employed in this paper.\n\nThe issue outlined in the context of Pensieve, and I am quoting the lines here:\n\n\u201cHowever, while Mao et al. (2017) demonstrated better performance than previous methods, subsequent large- scale empirical investigation demonstrated that, when unleashed in the real world, Pensieve exhibits poor QoE (Yan et al.). This can be attributed to the gap between Pensieve\u2019s training environment (a simulator) and the complexity of real-world traffic conditions, as well as to DRL\u2019s notoriously brittle optimization process.\u201d\nI believe this issue is not exclusive to Pensieve itself; rather, it applies to any algorithm. In other words, any algorithm lacking training on a comprehensive dataset that accurately represents real-world scenarios will likely underperform. This is not a problem specific to Pensieve."

Pensieve fails to perform well - Puffer show it in their paper. We divided the problem into two small problems. One, estimatet the only unknown parameter (transmission time) using Fugu and our contribution - A model that takes in account the state + the result form Fugu. The novely is our model can adapt its predicitons accordingly to the accuracy of Fugu (while MPC does not do it). Moreover our model (Wolfi) learns a policy - meaning we can replace the TTP (Fugu) but use the same policy (Wolfi) and still succeed.\n3. I don't understand the question\n4. Training Pensieve would take enormous time (Puffer mentioned it in their paper) But training Wolfi would take much less because we learn a generalized policy that can be applied with different models of Fugu. Learning a policy is much more stable than learning to predict on the raw inputs of network. The variance in the real world is too big to be applicatable. We show out method can be learn in a reasonable time and can be generalized to other environments."

Video quality can be measured simply in terms of the video bitrate (as in (Mao et al., 2017)), or via more nuanced measures like the structural similarity index measure (SSIM)\u2014a method for predicting the viewer-perceived quality of digital images and videos. What was used? \n\n- Assuming SSIM was used to for perceived quality, VQM is a better QoE indicator and VMAF[1] can be used to compute QoE for chunks. Since QoE is one of key findings I would want to see a more robust metric over SSIM. \n\n- Not exactly weakness but you probably don't want to write about Zoom conversation in the context of HTTP streaming as real time streaming is typically over webRTC and has nothing to do with HTTP streaming. \n\n[1] https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf"

The method used is a combination of supervised learning to (i) predict the download times of different chunks followed by (ii) reinforcement leaning to decide which ones to choose.  It thus adopts the structure of a recent, successful approach that has the same prediction step, but used MPC for the second step.  This work essentially replaces MPC with an RL portion."

Essentially, the main idea is that an RL approach (using a DQN variant) may be used to produce a similar performance as an MPC in the case of video ABR.  The supervised learning part to generate some of the features (state information) used by the RL is obtained from a  previous work.  While this is a nice combination, the notion of RL as yielding a policy comparable (or superior) to MPC is well known.  This paper should probably be submitted to a networking venue such as those where Mao-2017 and Yan-2020 appeared."
