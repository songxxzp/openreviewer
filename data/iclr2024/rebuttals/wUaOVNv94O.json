The authors propose to combine monte-carlo integration methods with neural integration techniques; where neural integration techniques are used to reduce the variance of monte-carlo sampling. \n\nMore formally, the authors approximate the integral, by parameterizing a neural network $G_\\theta:\\mathbb{R}^d\\to \\mathbb{R}$. The authors assume the existence of a change of variable form a box constraint $\\prod [l_i, u_i]$ to $\\Omega$, $\\Phi$. The authors extend auto-int to the multivariate case, by finding $\\theta$ that such that $\\frac{\\partial^d G}{\\partial x_1\\dots\\partial x_d}$ approximates well $f(p)$, by minimization of the MSE $\\mathbb{E}\\_p\\|\\frac{\\partial^d G}{\\partial x\\_1\\dots\\partial x\\_d}(\\Phi(p))|D \\Phi(p)|^{-1} - f(p)\\|^2$.\n\nThe main idea of the authors is to then use this estimation of the antiderivative as a control variate to then do Monte-Carlo sampling rather than using it directly. \nIndeed, assuming that the bounds $u$ are well-chosen, we have $\\int f(p)dp  = G_\\theta(u_1, \\dots, u_d) + \\int[ f(p) - \\frac{\\partial^d G}{\\partial x\\_1\\dots\\partial x\\_d}(\\Phi(p))|D \\Phi(p)|^{-1} ]dp$.

For instance, the extension of auto-int requires computing a d-th derivative; the corresponding computational costs should be discussed. \n\nHere is a list of typos + misc remarks.\n-In eq.1 , f has two variables z, p . Then the authors write f(p) at the end of hte paragraph. This confusion is present many times in the paper.\n- vectors are randomly written with either in bold font or with arrows on top: in eq.1 we have bold, in eq.2 we have arrows \n- Top of page 2: G is a function of (a, b), then the authors write G'(x). There is also a constant change of notation between G_\\theta and F_\\theta.\n- In the intro the authors write G as a function of p while later it will only act on the boxes [l_i, u_i] with variable x. \n- \"as takes\"\n- Page 3, the paragraph \"Neural Network Integration Methods\" contains many redundant citations\n- Eq.4: yet another notation, this is redundant with eq1\n- $\\Phi$ should be one-to-one, not only invertible.\n- \"a region of R^d\" -> the region should be a box constraint.\n- $\\Phi$ becomes $\\Phi^{-1}$ later in the paper. The authors write $\\Phi(x)$ in eq.5 but $\\Phi(p)$ in e.g. eq11, 12\n- \"with Jacobian being r.\" It is the determinant of the Jacobian\n- \"once can see\"\n- around eq.8 : why all the notations \"a, b , T, T_min, T_max\"...\n- below eq.8 $F'_\\theta$.\n- \"(i.e. for all pairs of\" missing closing parenthesis.\n- The notion of anti derivative should be recalled precisely in the context  of multi-dimensional functions\n- The notation $\\frac{\\partial^d G}{\\partial x}$ should be explained clearly\n- The authors write $\\Phi(dp)$ in many places, dp should just be p.\n- In the big eq. above eq. 16, $I_\\theta$ should be $G_\\theta$.\n- $F_\\theta$ in eq. 16."

The key idea of the method is to use a fairly flexible analytically tractable \"neural\" integral (with a tractable integrand corresponding to it) to create a control variate for a Monte Carlo estimate of the spatial integral. The method is successfully tested on the Poisson and Laplace equations both of which require fairly low-dimensional spatial integration.
