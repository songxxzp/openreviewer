                    "value": "In this paper, the authors proposed EquiformerV2, which is a newly developed equivariant network for 3D molecular modeling built on the Equiformer. From the experimental evaluation, the EquiformerV2 model achieved strong performance on the large-scale OC20/OC22 benchmark, QM9 dataset and also the new AdsorbML dataset. Such performance improvement upon Equiformer is achieved via several architectural modifications: (1) levering eSCN's efficient SO(2) convolution implementation for SO(3) convolutions (tensor product operations); (2) Attention Re-normalization for stabilizing training; (3) Separable S2 activation for mixing representations with different degrees; (4) separate Layer Normalization."

By leveraging the key techniques from eSCN, the EquiformerV2 also achieves learning irreducible representations with larger maximum degrees, which has been verified again to be useful for large-scale DFT benchmarks.\n\n2. **Regarding the empirical performance**. In the OC20 benchmark, EquiformerV2 sets a new standard by delivering state-of-the-art performance in the Structure-to-Energy-Force task. The model, further trained on this task, effectively serves as a force-field evaluator, demonstrating impressive performance in both IS2RS and IS2RE tasks. EquiformerV2 surpasses the performance of the compared baselines across all tasks, with a notable edge in force prediction. Furthermore, it significantly enhances the success rate on the AdsorbML dataset."

Both the efficient SO(2) convolution and S^2 activation are from eSCN, while the attention re-normalization and layer normalization are more like engineering tricks. Among these differences from Equiformer, the eSCN SO(2) convolution plays an essential role in enabling the use of irreducible representations of higher degrees, and the S^2 activation also replaces all non-linear activations. In fact, these design strategies should be mainly credited to the eSCN work.\n\n*******************************************Post Rebuttal *********************************************\n\nThank the authors for the response.

[Weakness 2] Both the efficient SO(2) convolution and $S^2$ activation are from eSCN. \u2026 These design strategies should be mainly credited to the eSCN work.\n\nIndeed, we do credit and cite prior works in the paper \u2014 eSCN [1] for proposing SO(2) convolution, and Spherical CNNs [2] for $S^2$ activation (which was later adopted by SCN [3] and eSCN [1]).\nHowever, naively combining eSCN convolution with Equiformer does not work well (Table 1(a)), and naively using $S^2$ activation is unstable to train. Our proposed modification of **separable** $S^2$ activation is necessary since it stabilizes training on the OC20 S2EF-2M dataset (Index 3 and Index 4 in Table 1(a)).\n\nReference:  \n[1] Passaro et al.

[Weakness 3] The attention re-normalization and layer normalization are more like engineering tricks.\n\nThe three proposed modifications are conceptually simple but necessary to extract the most performance gain when using higher degree representations. Naively scaling to higher degrees without these does not improve and can sometimes even hurt performance. We have shown this through results on OC20 (Table 1(a)) and QM9 (Table 13 in the revision)."

[Weakness 2] The results on QM9 are similar compared to Equiformer.\n\nWe disagree. Reiterating results from Table 5 in the paper, EquiformerV2 achieves better results than Equiformer on 9 out of 12 tasks on QM9, is similar on 1 task, and worse on 2. \n\nAs for the much larger and diverse OC20 dataset, EquiformerV2 is considerably better (Table 6), by up to 25.8% on forces and 4.2% on energies. \n\nIn Section 4.3, we do acknowledge that the performance gain from using higher degrees and the improved architecture are not as significant on QM9 as they are on OC20. This is consistent with prior work, which has shown that trends on small and large datasets are not always consistent [1]. Due to the small size of QM9, and limited diversity in atom types, counts and angular variation, higher degree networks are more prone to overfitting. In Section 4.3, we also outline potential ways of mitigating this overfitting by first pre-training on large datasets and then transferring to smaller datasets, as has recently been demonstrated by [2].\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Gasteiger et al.

[Major Weakness 1] Ablation study of attention re-normalization, separable $S^2$ activation, and separable layer normalization, on the QM9 dataset.\n\nWe conduct ablation studies similar to Table 1(a) using the task of $\\Delta \\varepsilon$ on QM9 and compare with the Equiformer baseline [1]. The mean absolute error (MAE) results are as below.\n\n| Index  | Attention re-normalization |   Activation  |     Normalization    | $L_{max}$ | MAE (meV) |\n|:------:|:--------------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------:|:-------:|:---------:|\n| 0      | Equiformer baseline        |               |                      | 2       | 29.98     |\n| 1      |                            |      Gate     |      Layer norm      |    4    |   30.46   |\n| 2      |              \u2714             |      Gate     |      Layer norm      |    4    |   29.51   |\n| 3      |              \u2714             |      $S^2$      |      Layer norm      |    4    |   30.23   |\n| 4      |              \u2714             | Separable $S^2$ |      Layer norm      |    4    |   29.31   |\n| 5      |              \u2714             | Separable $S^2$ | Separable layer norm |    4    |   29.03   |\n\n- Index 1: Naively increasing $L_{max}$ from 2 to 4 and using eSCN convolutions degrade the performance. This is due to overfitting since the QM9 dataset is overall smaller, and each structure in QM9 has fewer atoms, less diverse atom types and much less angular variations than OC20 and OC22. \n- Index 2: Attention re-normalization improves the MAE result.\n- Index 3: Although using $S^2$ activation is stable here (unlike OC20), it results in higher error than using gate activation (Index 2) and the Equiformer baseline (Index 0).\n- Index 4: The proposed separable $S^2$ activation achieves lower error than gate activation and $S^2$ activation.\n- Index 5: The proposed separable layer normalization further improves the result.\n\nComparing Index 0 and Index 5, the three proposed architectural improvements are necessary to achieve better results than the baseline when using higher degrees on QM9. Overall, these ablation results follow the same trends as OC20.\n\nWe have added this ablation study to Table 13 in the revision.\n\n[1] Liao et al.
