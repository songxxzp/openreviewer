Moreover, there are even more kinds of tessellations beyond Voronoi in Euclidean geometry.

                    "value": "1. The style of presentation of content in this manuscript makes it very challenging to follow for readers without the requisite background in topology. \n\n(a) For example, section 3 Thurston Geometry introduced a lot of jargon and notation without definition -  \"universal cover\" / $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathcal{R}). \n\n(b) Similarly, comparing  the caption description of Fig 1 with the textual description in paragraph 3 of section 3 makes it more difficult and abstract than necessary to understand what the authors are actually trying to convey (A simple fix would be to mark the corresponding points referred to in the text to illustrate the main point). Additionally, the tessalations in the figure are not actually referred to/described in the text using the terminology of the caption, which is very strange.\n\n2. There is little to no background on connnectomics and/or representation learning for connectomics, beyond a few scattered citations. This is rather surprising, since this is a very active field with several works spanning diverse perspectives and approaches from graph theory, statistical models, deep learning, to name a few. The datasets/simulation parameters used in the paper are not described well enough to follow\n\n3. The application aspect of the paper is ill motivated and kind of lost in the emphasis on mathematical explanation. The paper does not do a good job of illustrating why the embeddings are actually helpful for brain connectomics beyond Thurston's conjecture from 1982. This makes it really hard to appreciate why this approach is particularly useful for brain connectomes. In fact, it is very hard to discern what kind of connectomes- functional/structural the embeddings are being applied to.\n\n4. It is not clear how the authors arrive at the likelihood expression in Section 4, which seemingly assumes independence in the pairwise interactions and a functional form for the probability based on the distance measure. Additionally, does the connectome model (V ,E) consider weighted or negative valued edges, as one would obtain from pairwise similarity measure in functional connectomics? \n\n5. The datasets are not described at all in the main paper beyond the references in Table 1. The results in Tables 3 and 4 are really hard to parse and require the reader to go back and forth between the explanation and the table- since the captions are very nondescript, with best performances not highlighted. Additionally, no standard deviation measures have been reported (to quantify variability in either the simulation/and or population)"
