                    "value": "The paper proposes a procedure for training sparse Bayesian neural networks with a factorized variational distribution. It does so by alternating between optimizing the parameters of a subset of the weight distributions, with the remaining ones zeroed out, and updating the subset of non-zero weights by adding to and removing from that subset based on a range of criteria. The experiments show improved accuracy and calibration on CIFAR10/100 over methods from the literature at higher sparsity.\n\nOverall, I would say that the paper introduces some reasonable but not ground-breaking technical material, however it is let down by a severely limited evaluation, omitting most standard uncertainty estimation benchmarks. With some further issues around overclaiming novelty, I would argue for rejecting the paper in its current form."

                    "value": "1. the experiments are quite bare-bones for a BNN paper, there is no evaluation of predictive uncertainty besides calibration -- we don't need a Bayesian approach do well on this metric. I would either suggest adding e.g. a temperature scaling baseline applied to a sparse deterministic net or (preferably) the usual out-of-distribution and distribution shift benchmarks.\n2. primarily testing at a single sparsity level as in Table 2 also seems a bit limited to me. In my view, there are broadly two possible goals when using sparsity: opitimizing sparsity at a given performance level, e.g. close to optimal, or optimizing performance at a given sparsity level. I would have liked to see more figures in the style of Figure 2 left and Figure 3 to cover both of these settings also for the baselines.\n3. I would have liked to see a bit more in-depth investigation of the pruning criteria, e.g. a plot of Spearman correlations between the preferred score and the others throughout training or a correlation matrix at various stages (say beginning, halfway through and end of training). I must say that I am not overly convinced that they matter too much, the variation of accuracy in Fig 2 seems to be only about 0.5% (although see questions). So I think it might be worth saving the page discussing the criteria in fewer of more thorough experiments.\n4. the paper makes some rather inaccurate claims vs the existing literature. In particular, it is not the first paper introducing a \"fully sparse BNN framework that maintains a consistently sparse Bayesian model through- out the training and inference\", this statement also applies to the (Ritter et al., 2021) paper, which is incorrectly cited as a post-hoc pruning paper (the paper does use post-hoc pruning as an optional step to further increase sparsity, but the core low-rank parameterization is maintained throughout training). This doesn't affect the contribution of course, but prior work needs to be contextualized correctly.\n5. I don't really see the need to make such claims in the first place, it is not obvious that sparsity in training is desirable. Of course it may be the case that a larger network that would not fit into memory without sparsity performs better, but then this needs to be demonstrated (or like-wise any hypothetical training speed increases resulting from a reduced number of FLOPs - in the age of parallelized computation, that is a mostly meaningless metric if it cannot be shown that a practical implementation can lead to actual cost savings).\n6. the abstract is simultaneously wordy and vague. I did not know what the paper was doing specifically after reading it, even though it really isn't hard to describe the method in 1 or 2 sentences. I would say that the low-rank/basis terminology led me in the wrong direction of thinking and a pruning-based description would have been clearer, but this may of course differ for readers with a different background."

                    "value": "- how are the mean values initialized for weights that are added to the active set? I assume 0? Do you reuse the old value if a weight had been temporarily removed?\n- I'm not sure I follow the discussion of Figure 2 right. For the initialization of the variance of a mean-field Gaussian, identical considerations apply as for the initialization of weights in deterministic networks, so loosely speaking we want to scale the sum of variance of the means and the initial value of the variance parameter inversely with the number of units to avoid the activations diverging with increasing depth. So to me it seems natural, that dense VI would reach this critical threshold before a pruned variance, as the latter is simply removing terms from a positive sum and thus decreasing variance. Am I missing something/misinterpreting the figure?\n- Can you demonstrate any practical benefits from sparsity during training/the FLOP reduction translating to real time speedups?\n\nFor suggestions see weaknesses."

In light of these comprehensive revisions, we kindly hope that you will consider raising your score.\n\n## Experiments about OOD detection and distribution shift benchmark\n\nWe extended our experiments to two distribution shift benchmarks including both Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks and robustness benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our SSVI consistently improves over the strongest baseline, mBNN, significantly across all sparsity levels, metrics, and tasks. The results are presented both in the subsequent sections and in the updated Appendix D.\n\nFor OOD detection tasks, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) using our models, which were trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100 and tested on CIFAR-100/10 and SVHN, following the methodology of previous studies [1]. In this context, we employed the mBNN algorithm, the strongest previous work, as our baseline, ensuring equal sparsity for a fair and meaningful comparison.\n\n|  **Train set**  |  |           |   CIFAR-10   |       |      | |          |   CIFAR-100   |       |      |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|\n|   Test set  | | CIFAR-100 |      |  SVHN |      |  | CIFAR-10 |      |  SVHN |      |\n|       Metric      |    Sparsity      |   AUROC   | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |    Sparsity       |   AUROC  | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |\n|     mBNN    |   96.4%  |    0.84   | 0.81 |  0.89 | 0.94 |   87.8%   |   0.76   | 0.72 |  0.78 | 0.88 |\n| SSVI (ours) |    95%   |    **0.86**   | **0.84** |  **0.93** | **0.96** |    **90%**    |   **0.80**   | **0.77** |  **0.85** | **0.91** |\n\n\nWe proceed to assess our model, trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100, on the respective corrupted versions, CIFAR-10/100-C.

Calibration is widely recognized as a crucial metric in Bayesian deep learning literature, particularly as an indicator of a model's uncertainty capabilities. This perspective is not only supported in the paper you referred to [1] but also in our most closely related baseline [8]. Additionally, calibration is considered a significant metric in various studies investigating the posterior of Bayesian models, as seen in references [9, 10]."

                        "value": "## Results of more sparsity levels for baseline algorithms\n\nFor our SSVI, we present outcomes at various sparsity levels in Figure 2, as you noticed. However, this does not extend to the baseline algorithms. Actually, all the baseline algorithms utilize implicit regularization to steer the model towards a level of sparsity that is not predefined, leading to a process that is frequently unstable and heavily dependent on precise hyperparameter tuning to achieve a satisfactory level of sparsity. Therefore, we first train the baselines following the settings in their original papers, then adopt the obtained sparsity level in our SSVI training to ensure a fair comparison. \n\nWe want to highlight that this is one of the advantages of our SSVI \u2014- the sparsity can be flexibly assigned before training. We demonstrate the efficacy of SSVI across a range of sparsity levels and also explore its performance with various optimization schedules within the same sparsity level, as shown in Figures 2 and 3.\n\n## Influence of pruning criteria\n\nIndeed, the choice of pruning criteria is crucial. It is important to note that global metrics like Spearman correlations may not be the most suitable metric for assessing the differences between various scores in this context. Since we utilize the score solely for selecting the top-K weights without incorporating it into the training process, and considering that K is significantly smaller than the total number of weights, a high Spearman score may not accurately reflect the divergence in the chosen weights.\n\nTherefore, we have opted for the ratio of intersection over union (IoU). Each score selects the top-K weights for a fixed number K, and we calculate the intersection over union for all pairs among our five different scores. \n\nIn the following, we present the Intersection over Union (IoU) matrices for the five pruning criteria at the initial, middle, and final stages of training, respectively. Additionally, we include in the supplementary material the average of all 10 IoU values for different pairs across the training steps. The findings reveal that while the criteria show high similarity (reflected in high IoU scores) in the initial phase, they diverge as training progresses, potentially due to more precise uncertainty information and consequently more appropriate criteria. It is also notable that the traditional criteria, specifically $|\\mu|$ and $\\mathrm{SNR}{q_{\\phi}}(\\theta)$, exhibit a persistent similarity during the entire training period. On the other hand, the three novel criteria we introduced: $\\mathbb{E}{q_\\phi}|\\theta|$, $\\mathrm{SNR}{q_{\\phi}}(|\\theta|)$, and $\\mathbb{E}{q_\\phi}e^{\\lambda|\\theta|}$, show a marked deviation from these conventional metrics, emphasizing the innovative aspect of our methodology.\n\n\n\u2014-----------------IoU matrix at the beginning of training\u2014-----------------\n\n|                                          | $\\|\\mu\\|$ | $SNR_{q_{\\phi}}(\\theta)$ | $\\mathbb{E}_{q\\phi}\\|\\theta\\|$ | $SNR_{q_{\\phi}}(\\|\\theta\\|)$ | $\\mathbb{E}_{q\\phi}e^{\\lambda\\|\\theta\\|}$ |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| $\\|\\mu\\|$                                | 1.0       | 0.9995                   | 0.9122                         | 0.9981                       | 0.9122                                   |\n| $SNR_{q_{\\phi}}(\\theta)$                 | 0.9995    | 1.0                      | 0.9118                         | 0.9985                       | 0.9118                                   |\n| $\\mathbb{E}_{q\\phi}\\|\\theta\\|$            | 0.9122    | 0.9118                   | 1.0                            | 0.9118                       | 0.9996                                   |\n| $SNR_{q_{\\phi}}(\\|\\theta\\|)$             | 0.9981    | 0.9985                   | 0.9118                         | 1.0                          | 0.9118                                   |\n| $\\mathbb{E}_{q\\phi}e^{\\lambda\\|\\theta\\|}$ | 0.9122    | 0.9118                   | 0.9996                         | 0.9118                       | 1.0                                      |"

As a result, their computation costs in both training and inference remain similar or even larger than the dense BNNs. In contrast, our method directly enforces sparsity in $W$, which has a substantial reduction of computation costs theoretically. Besides, the sampling rule in (Ritter et al., 2021) requires a Gaussian parameterization, whereas our method is more flexible and can generalize beyond Gaussian parametrization. Yet, we still thank you for the comment and will change the description of (Ritter et al., 2021) in the revision.\n\n## Why do we need sparsity in training\n\nWe note that the concern raised is not unique to our work on sparse Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) but extends to the broader field of sparse neural networks. The advantages of having sparsity in training have been addressed in previous discussions, such as [5]. Here we formulate the answer about why we need sparsity in training from two directions: speedup and performance.\n\n**Real-time speedup:**\n\nFirst, we want to clarify that sparsity in training can lead to actual, real-time performance improvements on modern hardware, beyond just theoretical advantages suggested by FLOPs reduction. As shown by [5], *\u201cAnother notable success was recently demonstrated by DeepSparse [11, 12], which successfully deploys large-scale BERT-level sparse models on modern Intel CPUs, obtaining 10\u00d7 model size compression with < 1% accuracy drop, 10\u00d7 CPU-inference speedup with < 2% drop, and 29\u00d7 CPU-inference speedup with < 7.5% drop.\u201d* Additionally, there are considerable efforts, such as those by NVIDIA, to develop advanced GPU kernels like Sputnik [13] and the NVIDIA Ampere Architecture [14], which *\u201cbuilt the momentum to better support finer-grained sparsity\u201d* and thereby increase real-time speedup. We will explore how to achieve real wall-time speedup with the specific hardware in our future work."

                        "value": "**Performance improvement:**\n\nAs highlighted in your review, sparsity is key to training larger models within memory constraints. This leads to the question: Why not simply opt for a small dense model instead? The answer lies in the distinct advantages of large sparse models. Also shown by [5], *\u201cSparse NNs keep the same model architectures with those dense large models, but only activate a small fraction of weights. Since state-of-the-art sparse NNs can match the utility performance of their dense counterparts (through either pruning or DST/PaI), sparsity can potentially be a free lunch to make training/inference cheaper while performing the same well.\u201d* This is also illustrated in our research, particularly evident in Figure 2 where we see a largely stable performance curve against sparsity level and hyperparameter selection. In contrast, a small dense model with a similar parameter count typically exhibits a noticeable drop in performance when compared to its larger, dense equivalent, as demonstrated in references [2,3,4]. Consequently, when considering models with comparable parameters, the superior performance of large sparse models makes them a preferable choice over small dense models in training scenarios.\n\n\nA more contemporary and well-known instance highlighting the effectiveness of large sparse models is the adoption of Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) techniques. These techniques employ large sparse models not just during training but also throughout the inference process. They have been recognized as optimal solutions at the industrial level, as evidenced in high-profile projects such as Switch transformers [6] and Glam [7]. This trend underscores the practicality and efficiency of large sparse models in advanced applications, demonstrating their utility beyond the theoretical advantages of reduced FLOPs. \n\n\n\n## Abstract presentation\n\nWe would like to clarify that our paper is not only about pruning. Our paper is about how to find an optimal sparse subspace to do variational inference. To solve this problem, we optimize the sparse subspace and the corresponding variational model together. In this context, a removal(pruning)-based algorithm emerges as a natural solution within an alternative optimization schedule. We appreciate your input and will refine the abstract to provide a clearer description in the revised draft.\t\n\n## Initialization of weight mean\n\nFor initializing the mean values of weights added to the active set, we use a zero initialization. \n\n\n## About Figure 2 right\n\nYour interpretation is essentially accurate. The phenomenon you described underscores a key advantage of our SSVI over conventional VI in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs).\nIn Figure 2, we empirically verified this interpretation, as you correctly noted. \nIt is important to recognize that training BNNs is more sensitive to initialization than training conventional neural networks. This makes our comparison between SSVI and VI particularly revealing. Consequently, the findings presented in Figure 2 right are neither trivial nor obvious and should be regarded as substantial."

The idea, that is different to the previous sparse BNNs, is to explicitly keep the number of non-zero weights in the neural network fixed while updating which weights are included or excluded as non-significant. This is in contrast to the existing literature, where sparsity is induced by special priors and, firstly, still starts with a dense model that is sparsified during training, which still make inference during training computationally expensive. Secondly, sparsity-inducing priors do not allow to set a specific level of sparsity, which may require a user to play with hyperparameters of the prior to get the desired level of sparsity. The proposed method has a level of sparsity as a hyperparameter and it is fixed from the start of the training, saving computational efforts from the start. Experiments in CIFAR-10/100 show the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to other sparse NNs in accuracy, loss, ECE, and training FLOPs."

We answer your questions below.\n\n## More previous works in BNNs\n\nIn the introduction section of our revised paper, we have incorporated the work you referenced, along with other pertinent studies. Specifically, we have expanded our discussion to include additional works on stochastic variational inference [2,3,4] and Monte Carlo methods [5,6,7], beyond those already cited in the current version.\n\n\n## More experiments\n\nWe extended our experiments to two distribution shift benchmarks including both Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks and robustness benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our SSVI consistently improves over the strongest baseline, mBNN, significantly across all sparsity levels, metrics, and tasks. The results are presented both in the subsequent sections and in the updated Appendix D.\n\nFor OOD detection tasks, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) using our models, which were trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100 and tested on CIFAR-100/10 and SVHN, following the methodology of previous studies [1]. In this context, we employed the mBNN algorithm, the strongest previous work, as our baseline, ensuring equal sparsity for a fair and meaningful comparison.\n\n|  **Train set**  |  |           |   CIFAR-10   |       |      | |          |   CIFAR-100   |       |      |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|\n|   Test set  | | CIFAR-100 |      |  SVHN |      |  | CIFAR-10 |      |  SVHN |      |\n|       Metric      |    Sparsity      |   AUROC   | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |    Sparsity       |   AUROC  | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |\n|     mBNN    |   96.4%  |    0.84   | 0.81 |  0.89 | 0.94 |   87.8%   |   0.76   | 0.72 |  0.78 | 0.88 |\n| SSVI (ours) |    95%   |    **0.86**   | **0.84** |  **0.93** | **0.96** |    **90%**    |   **0.80**   | **0.77** |  **0.85** | **0.91** |\n\n\nWe proceed to assess our model, trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100, on the respective corrupted versions, CIFAR-10/100-C. Both datasets encompass 15 distinct corruptions, each classified into 5 corruption levels. The outcomes are presented in the following table, illustrating curves for the average accuracy, loss, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) across all 15 different corruptions for each level. \n\n| Dataset       | Model              | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CIFAR-10-C    | mBNN (ACC)         | 0.811   | 0.731   | 0.651   | 0.565   | 0.448   |\n|               | **SSVI (ACC)**     | **0.829**   | **0.754**   | **0.670**    | **0.585**   | **0.471**   |\n|               | mBNN (Loss)        | 0.721   | 1.075   | 1.469   | 1.931   | 2.659   |\n|               | **SSVI (Loss)**    | **0.668**   | **1.001**   | **1.384**   | **1.810**    | **2.408**   |\n|               | mBNN (ECE Loss)    | 0.066   | 0.092   | 0.110    | 0.129   | 0.151   |\n|               | **SSVI (ECE Loss)**| **0.052**   | **0.078**   | **0.099**   | **0.121**   | **0.145**   |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CIFAR-100-C   | mBNN (ACC)         | 0.583   | 0.499   | 0.437   | 0.369   | 0.279   |\n|               | **SSVI (ACC)**     | **0.611**   | **0.522**   | **0.455**   | **0.388**   | **0.293**   |\n|               | mBNN (Loss)        | 2.062   | 2.69    | 3.320    | 4.045   | 5.156   |\n|               | **SSVI (Loss)**    | **1.725**   | **2.247**   | **2.821**   | **3.351**   | **4.090**    |\n|               | mBNN (ECE Loss)    | 0.015   | 0.023   | 0.026   | 0.033   | 0.039   |\n|               | **SSVI (ECE Loss)**| **0.012**   | **0.019**   | **0.024**   | **0.029**   | **0.036**   |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n\nWe agree that applying SSVI to more ML tasks, beyond standard models and applications, is an interesting question and we are happy to explore it further in our future work."

Also, to really emphasize the usefulness of the proposed approach, it would be important to have empirical results on an expanded set of datasets + models + tasks (including UQ tasks such as OOD detection, misclassification detection, etc.)\n\n- I think the presentation can be improved. The authors introduce complex notations, but after reading through section 3 twice, I believe that it can be greatly simplified. For e.g., where exactly is eq 2 reconciled in the algorithm? Based on my reading, the paper would have been fine to totally exclude eq 2.  \n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Vadera, M. P., Cobb, A. D., Jalaian, B., & Marlin, B. M. (2022).

We believe the following explanations address all identified weaknesses and answer all the questions raised. If you find our response satisfactory, we kindly hope you will consider raising your score.\n\n## Comparison with previous works [1, 2]\n\nWe want to clarify that our work **fundamentally differs** from [1, 2]. Our approach involves developing a new framework for identifying the optimal sparse subspace, ensuring sparsity throughout the training process.  However, for [1], we quote what they mentioned at the beginning of their Section 3.1:\n\n*\u201c We emphasize that the contribution of this work is not to propose new methods for deriving sparse sub-networks, but rather to evaluate the impact of sparse sub-network structures on MCMC-based inference methods\u201d*\n\nThis indicates that [1] focuses on applying MCMC to pre-existing sparse neural networks to assess their impact on MCMC inference, which significantly differs from our work. While it is possible to modify their approach for VI, such as implementing VI on these pre-existing networks, our work diverges entirely from this route in two points: \nOur work aims to develop a novel algorithm for choosing sub-networks instead of just using existing methods. \nIn contrast to the two-step method of first developing a sparse network and then conducting MCMC in [1], our approach integrates the selection of sub-networks directly into the VI training process, creating a more efficient, single-phase procedure.\n  \nSimilar to several studies we discussed in the related works section that differ from our SSVI, [2] employs a one-shot pruning method following dense training, leading to significantly increased training costs compared with our SSVI. This one-shot approach tends to result in sub-optimal sub-networks, unlike our method which iteratively removes and adds elements to pinpoint a better sub-network. Furthermore, [2] depends on complexly designed priors to induce sparsity in the model, which can result in unpredictable levels of final sparsity. In contrast, our approach allows for precise control over the final sparsity level right from the start of the training process.\nWe have included [1,2] in the related works in the revision.\n\n## The authors haven't mentioned the model architecture used in their experiments.\n\nWe have mentioned the model architecture used in experiments, ResNet-18, in the first line of Section 4.1 on page 7. This model architecture is standard and has been widely used in the sparse Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) literature such as mBNN (Kong et al., 2023) and AEB (Deng et al., 2019). In fact, many papers on sparse BNNs (including Kong et al., 2023 and Deng et al., 2019) used ResNet as the **only** model architecture for large-scale Bayesian deep learning experiments. Therefore, we also chose ResNet to ensure a fair comparison."

                        "value": "## It would be important to have empirical results on an expanded set of datasets + models + tasks\n\nWe extended our experiments to two distribution shift benchmarks including both Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks and robustness benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our SSVI consistently improves over the strongest baseline, mBNN, significantly across all sparsity levels, metrics, and tasks. The results are presented both in the subsequent sections and in the updated Appendix D.\n\nFor OOD detection tasks, we computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) using our models, which were trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100 and tested on CIFAR-100/10 and SVHN, following the methodology of previous studies [1]. In this context, we employed the mBNN algorithm, the strongest previous work, as our baseline, ensuring equal sparsity for a fair and meaningful comparison.\n\n|  **Train set**  |  |           |   CIFAR-10   |       |      | |          |   CIFAR-100   |       |      |\n|:-----------:|:--------:|:---------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:---------:|:--------:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|\n|   Test set  | | CIFAR-100 |      |  SVHN |      |  | CIFAR-10 |      |  SVHN |      |\n|       Metric      |    Sparsity      |   AUROC   | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |    Sparsity       |   AUROC  | AUPR | AUROC | AUPR |\n|     mBNN    |   96.4%  |    0.84   | 0.81 |  0.89 | 0.94 |   87.8%   |   0.76   | 0.72 |  0.78 | 0.88 |\n| SSVI (ours) |    95%   |    **0.86**   | **0.84** |  **0.93** | **0.96** |    **90%**    |   **0.80**   | **0.77** |  **0.85** | **0.91** |\n\n\nWe proceed to assess our model, trained using SSVI on CIFAR-10/100, on the respective corrupted versions, CIFAR-10/100-C.

The outcomes are presented in the following table, illustrating curves for the average accuracy, loss, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) across all 15 different corruptions for each level. \n\n| Dataset       | Model              | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 | Level 5 |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CIFAR-10-C    | mBNN (ACC)         | 0.811   | 0.731   | 0.651   | 0.565   | 0.448   |\n|               | **SSVI (ACC)**     | **0.829**   | **0.754**   | **0.670**    | **0.585**   | **0.471**   |\n|               | mBNN (Loss)        | 0.721   | 1.075   | 1.469   | 1.931   | 2.659   |\n|               | **SSVI (Loss)**    | **0.668**   | **1.001**   | **1.384**   | **1.810**    | **2.408**   |\n|               | mBNN (ECE Loss)    | 0.066   | 0.092   | 0.110    | 0.129   | 0.151   |\n|               | **SSVI (ECE Loss)**| **0.052**   | **0.078**   | **0.099**   | **0.121**   | **0.145**   |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| CIFAR-100-C   | mBNN (ACC)         | 0.583   | 0.499   | 0.437   | 0.369   | 0.279   |\n|               | **SSVI (ACC)**     | **0.611**   | **0.522**   | **0.455**   | **0.388**   | **0.293**   |\n|               | mBNN (Loss)        | 2.062   | 2.69    | 3.320    | 4.045   | 5.156   |\n|               | **SSVI (Loss)**    | **1.725**   | **2.247**   | **2.821**   | **3.351**   | **4.090**    |\n|               | mBNN (ECE Loss)    | 0.015   | 0.023   | 0.026   | 0.033   | 0.039   |\n|               | **SSVI (ECE Loss)**| **0.012**   | **0.019**   | **0.024**   | **0.029**   | **0.036**   |\n|---------------|--------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n\n\n## Notations and Equation 2\n\nOur intention behind introducing all notations is to provide a clearer illustration of both our intuition and algorithm. Regarding Equation 2, we want to emphasize that it serves as the objective function (loss function) for our Sparse Subspace Variational Inference (SSVI). This is similar to Equation 1, which is the objective function for standard Variational Inference (VI). Equation 2 is a slight modification of Equation 1, representing our goal to constrain the variational space to a sparse subspace. The proposed algorithm SSVI is then developed to solve the optimization problem stated in Equation 2.\n\nMoreover, Equation 2 serves as the general form for sparse subspace VI. If we choose the common Gaussian as the variational distribution, it will result in a special case as shown in Equation 3. It is worth noting that other distribution families are possible but they may introduce unnecessary complexity and lead to alternative forms based on Equation 2. \n\nIn summary, Equation 2 is important to our framework, providing the foundation for the problem this paper tackles and guiding subsequent developments in our approach. We will revise this point in the final version to improve the clarity of the paper."

However, we appreciate the significance of this direction and plan to explore it in our future work.\n\n## Benefits of uncertainty metric in downstream tasks\n\nWe believe that the additional experiments on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and distribution shift tasks, as outlined above and detailed in Appendix D.1, effectively address this question. The experiments we have are similar to those in [3]. Our SSVI surpasses all baseline models in terms of ECE for standard tasks, AUROC and AUPR for OOD tasks. This improvement in uncertainty metrics contributes to the enhanced accuracy on corrupted datasets, as evidenced by our results with CIFAR-10/100-C.\n\n## References\n\n[1] Hippolyt Ritter, Martin Kukla, Cheng Zhang, and Yingzhen Li.

The crux of the work is to use sparsity inducing priors for VI - the sparsity isn't induced by dense training. Could the authors elaborate more on this? \n\nFinally, while I agree that the work of Vadera et al. doesn't really develop novel techniques for finding optimal sparse substructure, I still believe that it's an important baseline to compare against. \n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Ghosh, S., Yao, J., & Doshi-Velez, F.

                        "value": "Thanks again for your careful review and acknowledgment of our response and detailed reply! \n\n## The characterization of Ghosh et al., 2019 [1]\n\nWe want to clarify that we actually both agree on the point that  the sparsity is induced by priors for VI, as highlighted in both our first-round rebuttal: *\u201c[1] depends on complexly designed priors to induce sparsity in the model, \u201d* and also in our related works section in the original paper *\u201cmany studies have employed sparse-promoting priors to obtain sparse BNNs.\u201d* and *\u201cLouizos et al. (2017), Ghosh et al. (2019) and Bai et al. (2020) further explore the use of half-Cauchy, Horseshoe and Gaussian-Dirac spike-and slab priors respectively.\u201d* \n\nWe are not suggesting that dense training leads to sparsity. Our reference to \"dense training\" is to highlight our SSVI's superiority and distinction from previous works, including Ghosh et al., 2019 [1]. These studies induce sparsity through the use of specific priors. However, as noted in Section 4.3 of Ghosh et al., 2019 [1], *\u201cThe Horseshoe and its regularized variant provide strong shrinkage towards zero for small $w_{kl}$. However, the shrunk weights, although tiny, are never actually zero. \u201d*, this means their training is still dense so they still have a high training cost. In contrast, our SSVI approach achieves sparsity right from the start, leading to reductions in both training and inference costs.\n\n## About Vadera et al.\n\nWe have already added this paper Vadera et al. to our introduction section. We also agree that it\u2019s an interesting direction to extend the method from MCMC to VI as outlined in Vadera et al., and evaluate the sparse structure of our SSVI in comparison to prior works using approaches from Vadera et al. However, this is beyond the scope of our current work. We will investigate this systematically in our future work."
