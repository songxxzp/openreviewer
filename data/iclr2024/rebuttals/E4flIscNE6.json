                    "value": "This paper proposes a new method for training multiple student models simultaneously, called meta-collaboration, which improves student accuracy for all students and beats state-of-the-art distillation baselines. The method allows for flexible management of inference costs at test time and can be applied to various datasets and model architectures. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on CIFAR100 and TinyImageNet datasets and show that it outperforms other distillation methods."

                    "value": "While the idea of meta-learning for multi-teacher KD has potential, the claims require more empirical and analytical support. Broader experimentation, justification of design choices, and engagement with relevant studies would help validate the work's novelty and significance.\n\n1. Lack of novelty:\n\nWhile multi-teacher distillation is not a new idea, the paper claims to introduce a meta-learning approach to optimize the weights of different teachers. Direct comparisons to related work like AEKD (NeurIPS2020)  that uses optimization methods are missing. More discussion is needed to justify the claims of novelty. Also, meta-optimization is very difficult to implement and not very effective. Currently meta-optimized distillation is generally ineffective or difficult to reproduce\n\n2. Lack of thorough evaluation:\n\nThe evaluation on small datasets is insufficient. Following KD work norms, it should test on large-scale datasets like ImageNet and report downstream transfer learning results. The choice of teacher-student pairs could be better motivated by discussing alternatives like lightweight networks.  \n\n3. Lack of discussion on relevant studies:\n\nTo properly situate this work in the rapidly advancing KD literature, it needs to discuss closely related recent papers [1,2,3,4,5,6] like those pointed out. These address self-supervised KD, representation matching, offline-online transfer, architecture search for distillation, and automated KD - all highly pertinent topics the paper does not engage with. A more comprehensive literature review would strengthen the paper.\n\n[1] Self-Regulated Feature Learning via Teacher-free Feature Distillation.

The valuable insights they offered are highly appreciated, and we are grateful for the constructive feedback. We are devoted to addressing the reviewer's concerns and integrating their suggestions into the final version, with the goal of elevating the overall quality of our paper. In the following section, we present comprehensive responses to the reviewer's comments, queries, and recommendations, aiming to enhance the paper's overall rating.\n\n```\nLack of novelty\n```\nThank you for your insightful comments and for highlighting this clarity concern. We want to address a potential misunderstanding. This paper does not involve multi-teacher distillation; rather, it focuses on a single pre-trained teacher model, with all other models being student models that are concurrently undergoing training.\n\nA significant contribution of this paper is the enhancement of knowledge distillation efficacy through the implementation of instance-wise weights, particularly in scenarios where a substantial learning capacity gap exists between the teacher model and the student model. In the conventional knowledge distillation framework, the final loss is a combination of cross-entropy loss and KL-divergence-based KD loss. Our objective is to learn weights for each of these components in an instance-wise manner. This approach allows us to concentrate on hard labels for specific data points and soft labels from the teacher for another set of points, thereby achieving an optimal trade-off between learning from the teacher model and the hard labels.\n\nAdditionally, beyond learning instance-wise and loss component-wise weights, this work aims to capitalize on the learning patterns of student cohorts. This is realized through the utilization of C-Net.\n\n* meta-optimization is very difficult to implement and not very effective*\nMeta-learning is often used in setting to improve a model's generalization  and denoise setting. We point to a set of relevant literature in the Related work section.\n\n```\nLack of thorough evaluation\n```\nWe utilized teacher-student pairs from other papers addressing significant capacity differences between teacher and student models. While we were unable to complete the additional ImageNet experiments within the review period, we expect our method would enjoy significant gains over tranditional KD even on large scale datasets. \n\n```\nLack of discussion on relevant studies\n```\nThanks for pointing out the additional literature. However, again there seems to be some misunderstanding. The primary objective of this paper is to enhance the effectiveness of knowledge distillation through the utilization of instance-wise weights. In scenarios characterized by a substantial learning capacity disparity between the teacher model and the student model, knowledge distillation efficacy is frequently suboptimal and, at times, inferior to learning with hard labels. The papers referenced seem to improve distillation by introducing additional information or modifying the student model itself. Nevertheless, we will conduct a thorough comparison and contrast of our work with these referenced papers."

In the following section, we offer thorough responses to the reviewer's comments, questions, and suggestions, aiming to elevate the rating of our paper.\n\n```\nThe novelty is limited in my view. This work follows the widely used online distillation framework, except that the proposed C-NET part is trained with meta-learning. There are no clear improvements to the framework.\n```\n\nA primary contribution of this paper lies in enhancing the effectiveness of knowledge distillation by incorporating instance-wise weights in situations characterized by a significant disparity in learning capacity between the teacher and student models. In the typical framework of any knowledge distillation, the final loss is a combination of cross-entropy loss and KL-divergence-based KD loss. We aim to learn weights for each of these components on an instance-wise basis. This approach allows us to emphasize hard labels for specific data points and soft labels from the teacher for another set of points, facilitating an optimal trade-off between learning from the teacher model and the hard labels. This trade-off is crucial as diverse students exhibit varying learning capacities, and when a student model is considerably smaller than the teacher model, some learning from hard labels proves beneficial.\n\nBeyond learning instance-wise and loss component-wise weights, our work seeks to leverage insights from student cohorts, inspired by online distillation. However, unlike traditional online distillation, there is no explicit matching imposed among the student models through a loss function. Instead, this information is implicitly shared among the student models through the utilization of a common C-Net.\n\n```\nCan you provide further theoretical analysis or insights into how the meta-collaboration process influences the learning patterns of the student models?\n```\n\nThe effect on learning patterns of different student models while training with weights from C-Net like neural network is well studied in  [1]. The same setting is applicable here as well.\n \n[1]Shu, Jun, et al. \"Meta-weight-net: Learning an explicit mapping for sample weighting.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 32 (2019)."

It looks to me that the paper combines offline KD and online KD by training multiple students simultaneously while learning the loss weights with the meta-learning strategy (bi-level optimization). \n- It misses some ablation studies to show how the learned weights by C-NET are better than other weight strategies, e.g., manually set.\n```\n\nThank you for your insightful comments and for bringing attention to the clarity issue. We wish to address a potential misunderstanding. A key contribution of this paper is the enhancement of knowledge distillation efficacy through the incorporation of instance-wise weights. In scenarios where there exists a significant learning capacity gap between the teacher model and the student model, knowledge distillation efficacy is often suboptimal, and in some cases, inferior to learning with hard labels.\n\nTo alleviate this issue, our proposal involves the utilization of instance-wise and loss component-wise weights. Typically, in any knowledge distillation framework, the final loss is a combination of cross-entropy loss and KL-divergence based knowledge distillation (KD) loss. Our objective is to learn weights for each of these components on an instance-wise basis. This approach enables us to focus on hard labels for specific sets of data points and soft labels from the teacher for another set of points. This allows us to achieve an optimal trade-off between learning from the teacher model and the hard labels, a crucial consideration given the diverse learning capacities of different students. When a student model is significantly smaller than the teacher model, some learning from hard labels proves to be beneficial.  In addition to learning instance-wise and loss component-wise weights in this work we also want to benefit from learning patterns of the student cohorts. This is achieved via using C-Net. \n\n```\nWhy use PooledStudent logits as the supervision? Theoretical or empirical explanation is supposed to be provided.\n```\n\nIn the context of handling a knowledge distillation scenario characterized by a substantial disparity between the student and teacher models, it has been observed that incorporating outputs from intermediate models\u2014those with learning capacities between the teacher and student models\u2014enhances the knowledge distillation process. Consequently, we introduce the PooledStudent logits in conjunction with the teacher logits to amplify the knowledge transfer from the teacher model to the student model.  Here again, we control the participation of the PooledStudent logits in the training process using instance-wise loss-component-wise loss.  Further in Appendix B.1 we study the effect of the addition of PooledStudent logits."
