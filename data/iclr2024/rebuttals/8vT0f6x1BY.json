                    "value": "This paper aims to increase the transferability of adversarial attacks, by focusing on optimizing the surrogate model rather than the attack objective.\nTo enhance attack transferability, the authors employ SAM (sharpness-aware minimization) to train a surrogate model with a flatter loss landscape w.r.t. parameters so that adversarial attack optimization does not fall into local minima.\n\nThe authors first examine the relationship between non-robust features (Ilyas et al.) and the improvement in transferability resulting from early stopping in surrogate model training. Previous research suggests that \"slightly robust features\" transfer more effectively than non-robust features. However, this paper demonstrates that \"early stopped non-robust features\" transfer better than \"fully-trained non-robust features,\" challenging the existing hypothesis.\n\nNext, they explore the connection between the sharpness of the loss surface with respect to the parameters of a surrogate model and adversarial transferability. Firstly, they demonstrate that the transferability decreases as the learning rate decays during surrogate model training due to an increase in the sharpness of the loss surface. Secondly, they illustrate that using SAM (sharpness-aware minimization), particularly with a larger penalty than the default (denoted as l-SAM in the paper), can enhance transferability. Finally, they show that their method complements existing approaches and further enhances transferability."

Throughout the paper, there is no mathematical equation, and it lacks the necessary description to understand the paper. \n- (W1-1) The existing hypothesis and the authors' claim in Sec. 3 regarding the relation between the non-robust features hypothesis and early stopping are vague and difficult to understand since there is no mathematical formulation.\n- (W1-2) SAM should be described with a mathematical equation. SAM hyperparameter $\\rho$ is not described in the paper (requires referring to the original paper). \n- (W1-3) There are no descriptions of SAM variants (GSAM [Zhuang et al. 2022], ASAM [Kwon et al. 2022], and LookSAM [Liu et al. 2022]) used in their experiments, making their experiments difficult to interpret.\n\nW2. \nI do not see any contradiction between the existing hypothesis and the experimental results in  Section 3 regarding the relation between the non-robust features hypothesis and early stopping. \nAs far as I understand, [Benz et al. 2021] claim robust features transfer better than non-robust features. The authors' experiments show that \"early-stopped non-robust features\" are more transferable than \"fully-trained non-robust features,\" which is aligned with [Benz et al. 2021] since \"early-stopped non-robust features\" should be more robust than \"fully-trained non-robust features.\" (Anyway, this discussion requires mathematical formulation to discuss precisely.)\n\nW3. The fact that the loss-surface sharpness of a surrogate model affects the transferability has already been shown by [Gubri et al. 2022], hence reducing the scientific contribution of this paper. \n[Gubri et al. 2022] proposed a method called LGV that aims to enhance the loss-surface flatness of the surrogate model, which is the same motivation as this paper.\nIn fact, in Table 2, the difference between LGV and LGV+l-SAM is minor, making the contribution weak.\nThe authors should make clear what's the difference between LGV and their approach and their contribution.\n\n-------------------\nReferences\n\n[Benz et al. 2021] Batch Normalization Increases Adversarial Vulnerability and Decreases Adversarial Transferability: A Non-Robust Feature Perspective.

Is l-SAM useful for attacking adversarially trained models as well?\n\nQ3. What is the loss-surface sharpness value for other methods, such as SAT [Springer et al. 2021]? I would expect SAT to be sharper than l-SAM based on the paper's claim. If it is, it can strengthen the contribution. If it's not, I would like to know the explanation for why the SAT is less transferable. In other words, does the sharpness metric correlate well with the transferability?\n\n-------------------\nReferences\n\n[Wu et al 2020] SKIP CONNECTIONS MATTER: ON THE TRANSFERABILITY OF ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES GENERATED\nWITH RESNETS.

                        "value": "Thanks for your detailed review. We address the questions and weaknesses below.\n\n### Questions\n\n**Q1.** Thanks for raising this point. We leave as open question why the third phase of training behave differently than the second one after the learning rate decay. We will clarify this point.\n\n**Q2.** Thanks for your suggestion. We will add the evaluation on adversarially trained target model in the next revision.\n\n**Q3**. Thanks for the suggestion. We will add the sharpness metrics for SAT and other surrogate training techniques in Table 1 in the next revision. We will discuss the results accordingly.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n**(W1)** Thanks for your suggestions. We will improve the presentation by including formal mathematical formulations of non-robust features, SAM and its variants. Due to lack of space, we moved the description of the five SAM variants to the Appendix. We will do our best to improve their presentation.\n\n**(W2)** We respectfully and kindly disagree: our empirical observations in Section 3 are in contradiction with the conclusion of \\[Benz et al. 2021\\] that \"DNNs first mainly learn Robust Features (RFs) and then Non-Robust Features (NRFs)\", and that \"to get a substitute model with more Robust Features, a straightforward idea inspired by this finding is to train the substitute model with an early stop\" (page 8 of \\[Benz et al. 2021\\]). We agree with you that early learned NRFs are more transferable than fully learned NRFs (our Figure 2, green line). This conclusion conflicts with the explanation of \\[Benz et al. 2021\\] that early stopped improves transferability due to an inherent trade-off between RFs and NRFs. As a complement, Figure 3 shows that early stopped representations are best to target both NRFs and RFs targets. Considering transferability as a proxy to measure representation similarity, we do not observe such a trade-off between RFs and NRFs, along epochs. We will clarify our position.\n\n**(W3)** Thanks. We agree that we have the same motivation as \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\]. Our work complements \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\] for two reasons.  \n\n1. Contrary to \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\], we explicitly optimize the sharpness of the surrogate model. The high learning rate used by LGV \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\] implicitly affects sharpness.\n2. \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\] trains an ensemble of surrogates, whereas we train a single DNN. \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\] observes that a single LGV model transfers poorly, leaving as an open question whether we can improve the transferability of a single representation using flatness. We address this question.  \n\nWe will improve our current discussion of LGV \\[Gubri et al. 2022\\] in the related work."

Firstly, it provides empirical evidence that challenges the claim made by previous studies, which attribute the effectiveness of early-stopping on transferability to robust or non-robust features. Additionally, this paper establishes a correlation between the peak of transferability during training and both the decay of learning rate and the sharpness of the loss landscape. Based on this observation, the paper proposes the utilization of sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) as the optimizer for training a surrogate attack model, which can effectively improve the success rate of transfer attacks."

The evaluation experiments are only conducted on standardly trained models. I wonder how l-SAM works when attacking adversarially trained robust models.\n3. As acknowledged in Section 2, the underlying mechanism of SAM is still a popular research topic and remains controversial [1, 2]. In particular, it is still uncertain whether the effectiveness of SAM is caused by sharpness. Therefore, I suggest toning down some claims on the proposed method, such as:\n    \n    > the effect of early stopping on transferability is closely related to the dynamics of the exploration of the loss surface\n    > \n4. In Section 2, I suggest adding more details (e.g. training objective and algorithm) to improve readability, particularly for readers who are not familiar with SAM.\n5. In the context of adversarial robustness, leveraging SAM is not a completely new idea. While I'm not critiquing the novelty of this paper, I think the following papers [3,4] should be mentioned in the related work.\n\n    a. [3] proposes leveraging SAM to craft adversarial examples to find the common weaknesses of different models, which can boost the transferability of adversarial attacks.\n\n    b. [4] shows that using SAM with a larger $\\rho$ (exactly l-SAM in this paper) in standard training can improve adversarial robustness. Additionally, as shown in [5], a little robustness can improve adversarial transferability, so the effectiveness of using SAM in surrogate training is somewhat expected.

It demonstrates that transferability is linked to times when the learning rate decays and loss sharpness decreases. The sharpness-aware optimizer SAM is used, which enhances transferability beyond early stopping. The study also finds a strong correlation between the regularization effects of SAM and increased transferability, positioning sharpness-aware optimization as an effective approach for creating transferable adversarial examples."

This paper introduces an evaluation of various flat-minima optimizers, showing how these can significantly enhance the transferability of adversarial examples by minimizing loss sharpness.\n3. The study's focus on the SAM, particularly its large-neighborhood variant (l-SAM), provides evidence of its effectiveness in avoiding overly specific representations, thereby improving transferability.\n4.

                    "value": "The weaknesses of this work is listed below:\n\n1. First of all, the teaser figure (Fig. 1) is very confusing. I think the illustration is not clear enough. I cannot extract any information of the \"transferrability\" other than from the texts. I would recommend you to make the training curve in a color system that brighter colors represent high transferability, right now it seems SGD has the best transferability and the early stopping one has the worst. Also, why is this  statistic-based or just sketch map. If it is the latter case, I would recommend the authors to use the former to make this more convincing.\n2. I think both the notion used as well as the literature review of the sharpness for neural network in this work is very limited. First of all, the concept of sharpness has different meanings or evaluation method. Below are a lot of literature that this work missed:\n\n    > [1] Low-Pass Filtering SGD for Recovering Flat Optima in the Deep Learning Optimization Landscape, AISTATS 2022\n\n    > [2] A modern look at the relationship between sharpness and generalization, ICML 2023\n\n    > [3] On large-batch training for deep learning: Generalization gap and sharp minima, ICLR 2017\n\n    > [4]  Fantastic generalization measures and where to find them, ICLR 2020\n\n    > [5] Rethinking parameter counting in deep models: Effective dimensionality revisited (The Hessian-based metrics).\nIn fact, sharpness even has its own meaning in the context of adversarial training:\n\n    > [6] Evaluating and understanding the robustness of adversarial logit pairing.\nTo be frank, I do not believe the SAM-based sharpness is a very good metric for sharpness, and the authors need to prove it is meaningful in the context of adversarial training.\n\n3. If early stopping improves adversarial example's transferability, I think Figure 2 can be removed or moved to Appendix. Also, please improve the presentation by referring to the figure when making arguments. For example, on page 4 paragraph \"Early stopping indeed increases transferability.\", there is no figure referred and it is not friendly to readers.\n\n4. For section 4, I have a general question: what about there is no abrupt learning rate decay used during training, for example the cosine learning rate schedule is very popular in different training settings. Based on this work, does the sharpness always drops during training? This seems a bit odd and contradicts to existing finds saying that better robustness prefers better flatness, see [7] below.\n\n    > [7] Relating Adversarially Robust Generalization to Flat Minima/\n\n5. I think the most significant problem of the evaluation is that, it lacks a serious evaluation on the flatness. For example, the literature [1] provides a list of methods to evaluate the flatness following different metrics. The authors claim better flatness improves tranferability, but forget to measure the flatness. This is not convincing."

                        "value": "Thanks for your detailed review. We comment on the listed weaknesses below:\n\n1.  Thanks for your suggestion. We will use the suggested color maps to clarify the relation with transferability. Figure 1 is a sketch illustration. This figure represents a schematic basin of attraction, inspired by Kaddour et al. (2022). We will clarify in the legend that this is *not* a loss plot. \n2. Thanks for the references. We mentioned in our related work that the relationship between sharpness and natural generalization is subject to scientific controversy. We tried to reflect on both sides of the topic. Nevertheless, will improve our coverage of this extensive topic. Thanks for your suggestion.   \n   We would like to respectfully correct one point: our surrogate models are **not** trained with adversarial training. We train our surrogate model using SGD or SAM, then we craft adversarial examples against them that we feed to other target models to evaluate transferability. Our work does not consider sharpness in the context of adversarial training.\n3. We think that there might be a misunderstanding here. The Figure used in the paragraph \"Early stopping indeed increases transferability.\" (page 4) is already in Appendix B, as you suggested. The point of Figure 2 is not to show that early stopping improves transferability overall. Figure 2 provides evidence against the hypothesis currently accepted by the literature that early stopping learns more robust features than non-robust features. This Figure is key to supporting our strength 1 that you recognized as the most valuable of the paper. We will improve the clarity of the captions of Figures 2 and 3.\n4. The paper \\[7\\] suggested by the reviewer studies flatness in the context of adversarial training. Our surrogates are **not** trained with adversarial training, but with standard training (SGD or SAM). Therefore, it could be expected that our flatter model are not more robust. \n5. Thanks for your suggestion. Figure 5 uses two Hessian-based metrics to measure sharpness: the top-1 eigenvalue and the trace. Most importantly, we observe the effect of sharpness on transferability by evaluating optimizers that are known to decrease sharpness: SAM and five of its variants, that minimizes sharpness explicitly and SWA that does it implicitly. We will add other metrics of sharpness in a new revision of the paper."

The existing view is that there exist two types of features that model learns sequentially. So the early stopping improves transferability of attacks because the features learned first allow for more transferable attacks. The empirical evidence in the paper shows that both types of features show similar behavior with respect to attack success and the early stopping. The proposed conjecture is that transferability success depends on the learning schedule - it is shown empirically that around the LR decay epochs transferability spikes. This is further empirically connected with flatness wrt model parameters and then an approach to train flatter models (with SAM) as surrogate models is evaluated."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The main issue of the paper is the conceptual mismatch: empirical evidence shows that early stopping helps transferability of the attacks, also that transferability spikes when learning rate decays. Nevertheless, the statement \"when LR decays, the sharpness of the parameter space drops\" (page 5) is not valid overall. Learning rate does not take part in computation of the sharpness and does not affect it. Smaller learning rate is conjectured to drive models to \"sharper\" places, but up till now it is a conjecture. And therefore connection from LR experiments to sharpness experiments are not justified. Moreover it is stated that the success of transferability is related to the exploration of the loss surface (page 5), which is also not a precise statement - even with a large learning rate the trajectory of training can be very limited.\n\nSeveral times the concept of basins of attraction is mentioned (section 5), but it is not precisely defined and it is not explained why this is even useful for the transferability of the attacks. Analogously, several times a very vague term \"initial convergence\" of the training is used. Please define it properly if it is critical for understanding the explanations, or do not use it.\n\nIn the works on adversarial attacks it is very important to describe precisely the attack mode assumed. As I understood, the knowledge of the attacker in the paper is assumed to be almost absolute - so they can train a surrogate model with exactly same architecture, dataset and even training setup. This significantly weakens the challenge of attacking. Moreover, only one type of attack is checked, which might not be enough to make a general conclusion - it might be that exactly BIM attack is affected by the flatness, but PGD for example is not. I would rather suggest to reduce the amount of target architectures checked and the ways to induce the flatness, but add at least one more attack type, that is significantly different from BIM.\n\nThe discussion about robust features and non-robust ones is very convoluted. According to the definition provided it should be very hard to create adversarial attacks on the RF, but if they are learned first then how early stopping can improve transferability? Or it makes it harder to create attacks, but they are more universal? The conclusion on page 4, from the robust and non-robust surrogate models training seems to be inverted: early learned NRFs would have low transferability (since it grows with training), but early learned RFs might be this way. Moreover, the experiment with robust and non-robust surrogate model does not seem to prove that the hypothesis about the sequence of learning process (model first learns RFs and then NRFs) is wrong. We still see that there is a significant difference in the success rate between robust and non-robust features. The conclusion that can be made is rather that early stopping effect on transferability is not connected with robustness of features, but not that the models do not learn some features earlier than others and this does not affect transferability.\n\nThe conclusion made is that flatness of loss surface with respect to the parameters is defining in the transferability of adversarial attacks. While empirical evidence demonstrates validity of such conclusion, I would suggest to be very careful with distinguishing flatness with respect to parameters and optimization with respect to the input that is performed to generate adversarial attacks. First flatness does not necessarily connect with the second, therefore such conclusion may sound misleading.\n\nFinally, measuring only Hessian eigenvalues and trace is not the most precise way to measure sharpness (see for example Petzka, Henning, et al. \"Relative flatness and generalization.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021))."

                        "value": "Thanks for your detailed comments. \n\n### Question 1\n\nThanks for pointing out a potential ambiguity. Our central claim is that flat regions of the loss landscape contain better surrogate models. In Section 4, we study the impact of the learning rate on both sharpness and transferability, to provide a more fine-grained analysis of the transferability of early stopping: the transferability along epochs does not evolve smoothly. We uncover the peaks of transferability that happen when the learning decays. To these peaks of transferability correspond peaks of sharpness, suggesting a relationship. We confirm this relationship in Sections 5 and 6. We show that optimizers known to decrease sharpness (SWA, SAM and 5 SAM variants) train better surrogate models. In particular, the large flat neighborhoods found by SAM and its variants, improve transferability further. \n\nSection 3 challenges the accepted hypothesis that early stopping improves transferability due to a trade-off between robust and non-robust features along epochs. If such a trade-off had applied, we would have observed an \u201cX-shaped\u201d transferability\ncurves in Figure 2: increasing transferability from non-robust features and strictly decreasing transferability from robust features. Instead, the transferabilities of both robust and non-robust features evolve similarly along epochs. Considering transferability as a proxy to measure representation similarity, we do not observe such a trade-off between robust and non-robust features, since early stopping is best to transfer from and to both robust and non-robust features.\n\n### Question 2\n\nThanks for your question. The threat model used here is standard in the literature on the transferability of adversarial examples. As in most of the related work, we assume that the attacker can train a model on the same training set, but not using the same architecture, nor the same random seed. This is reflected in our experimental settings, since we report the transferability from one architecture to another (e.g., from ResNet-50 to ViT-B-16), trained with different random initialization and random batches. We will write explicitly the threat model considered, and in particular the assumption about the attacker's knowledge.\n\n### Ethics statement\n\nWe will add an ethics statement.
