At a high level, the paper is a study comparing hierarchical and flat policies but, it is extremely limited in scope: it evaluates exactly one method per category (hierarchical and flat and that too only model-based methods. Furthermore, the work only evaluates on a single class of tasks (locomotion). This sort of evaluation is not nearly comprehensive enough for a study paper.\n\nThere are also very clear writing/claiming issues. Statements such as \"We posit that hierarchical RL has three potential advantages,\ndue to the top-down nature of its learning signal: (a) HRL reduces the effective task horizon, (b) HRL learns generalizable and composable skills and (c) HRL allows for more sample-efficient few-shot adaptation.\" makes it appear that the authors are the first to consider the advantages of hierarchical RL. There is a wide body of work on hierarchical RL that has considered and noted similar advantages. While there are many relevant papers, I refer the authors to HIRO (Nachum et al) and Latent Skill Planning (Xie et al) for a recent treatment as well as the options framework (Sutton et all 1999) for more background. There is very little in the way of citation, this work seems largely incomplete."

There are only two domains considered in the experiments and both of them are designed by the authors. I suggest the authors evaluate on some HRL benchmarks. 2. HRL in the model-free direction has been explored a lot so if the authors want to draw a conclusion about general HRL, the model free methods should also be analyzed in terms of few/zero-shot adaptation. E.g. [1]\n\nSection 4.1, it is not clear to me what the author's conclusion is given the experimental results. It seems that two existing world-model style methods are compared and the hierarchical one is better than the flat policy one in only one domain. I don't think there is enough empirical evidence draw a conclusion.\n\nSection 4.2, it is not clear to me what the green train region means in the plots. Besides, I suggest the authors save the plots in the form of .pdf and put them in the paper as the plots in the current draft are a little blurry,\n\nSection 4.3, the authors should explain in more detail about what  WM, M, and V are. Otherwise it's hard to understand what the results imply. Also, the authors should provide the information about how many random seeds are run for each baseline.\n\nThe insights provided in the motivation section are not new. It has been proved that hierarchical RL structure benefits the transfer and adaptation of RL agent. E.g., see [2].\n\nThe code or the hyperparameter settings of the experiments are not provided. Details of the environments are also not provided.\n\n[1] Data-Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. Neurips 2018.\n\n[2] Meta-learning parameterized skills. ICML 2023."

If its effects are not lucidly explained, readers might struggle to understand its significance, implementation, and outcomes in the presented method. \n\n- This paper conducts an empirical study instead of proposing a novel method. While empirical studies are valuable, the conclusions from this paper are not too surprising.\n\n- The presentation of this paper can be improved.

The specific scope of this paper is cases with visual observations. The motivation for studying this problem is that hierarchical policies, by construction, learn some low-level skills/policies which might be useful when transferring to new environments or when dealing with a host of different settings/environments/tasks. Other benefits include the computational efficiency of HRL (due to a shorter horizon). The hierarchical framework explored Director (Hafner et al., 2022), which operates in latent action space, later decoded into low-level actions. The main addition to this framework is a task conditioning input passed to the world model of Director.  The experiments are conducted on two sets of tasks: bipedal and quadruped locomotion as well as quadruped navigation. The experiments show that HRL policies perform roughly the same as flat policies during training. However, when the environment or task is changed slightly (like the size/shape of the box changes for navigation or the speed required to walk at changes for locomotion), the performance drop in a flat policy is much more. The same holds for adaptation to the new task or environment - HRL policies adapt faster."
