It introduces a new method called the semi-anchored (SA) gradient method, which extend the idea of PDHG to the nonlinear setting by incorperating the certain Bregman distance as a preconditioner. With a designed Legendre function, the SA-GDmax and its practical version SA-MGDA are studied with convergence result and suitable optimality measure."

The paper is centered on the one-sided extrapolation-based PDHG method, and while all theoretical performance are similar to the extragradient method under weak MVI conditions, the motivation behind introducing this method may benefit from further clarification. The author also alludes to the potential for improving the extragradient method; providing more specific details on such improvements would enhance the paper.\n2. In Theorems 5 and 6, the use of gradient computational cost may not be ideal. The $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ cost pertains to the iteration cost of the proximal gradient descent method, where the computational cost of the proximal operator is neglected. Additionally,  the worst computational cost for this class of functions can be  $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon)$ as mentioned in arxiv:2101.11041.\n3. What is the numerical performance of the algorithm for nonconvex-nonconcave problems without the weak MVI condition? If it performs well in such cases, it may be worth exploring the possibility of relaxing certain conditions to accommodate a broader range of problems. Verifying weak MVI conditions can be challenging, and the need for each stationary point to meet this requirement in the derived theorems could be a limiting factor."

We clarified in revision that we are considering the prox-friendly function, which makes the computational cost of the proximal operation negligible.\n- (Q3) The fair classification experiment is the problem possibly without the weak MVI condition, which is exactly the setting the reviewer is asking for. We clarified this in the paper. / We agree with the reviewer's view on the weak MVI condition, and we are also interested in further relaxing the weak MVI condition, but this does not seem easy at the moment, even for the extragradient. / Regarding the dominant and PL conditions mentioned in the weaknesses section, the fair classification problem is linear in the max-player, so it is obvious that the dominant and PL conditions do not hold. (The toy example also does not satisfy those conditions.) Nevertheless, we have already ran the GDmax (without regularization) that is shown to work under the PL condition in the max-player (but not under the weak MVI), which was slower than the SA-GDmax in our fair classification experiment."

They show convergence of the Bregman divergence between two consecutive iterates for the Bregman proximal point (BPP) method by expressing the scheme as a preconditioned resolvent. By applying the hyperplane projection step of Solodov & Svaiter 1999 they increase the range of $\\rho$ (showing convergence in terms of the tangent residual). By modifying the preconditioner further they obtain a scheme which alternatingly computes a proximal gradient for the min-player and solves a proximal (implicit) update for the max-player. They immediately obtain convergence from the previous results. Finally they consider inexactness of the max-player for which they show convergence for the tangent residual."

If we are interested in the tangent residual in the first place, then a  $\\mathcal O(1/k)$ rate can be achieved by an _explicit_ scheme  _without_ (inexact) max-oracles by a primal-dual extragradient scheme.\n\nConsider for instance Algorithm 3 and the associated Theorem 8.2 of [Pethick et al. 2023](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ejR4E1jaH9k). Without stochasticity a $\\mathcal O(1/k)$ rate is recovered for the tangent residual (so no log factor as is otherwise the case when using inexact max-oracles). Algorithm 3 could be simplified further by observing that the bias correction term can be ignored in the deterministic case.\n\nI am left wondering: \n\n- what is the purpose of considering hyperplane projection and inexactness if we cannot provide guarantees in terms of Bregman divergence?\n- why not consider the setting without Bregman, and study a nonlinear variant of PDHG (which seemed to be the original motivation in the abstract and which variants for the convex-concave case is mentioned on page 4)? This would essential be an optimistic variant of the PDEG scheme mentioned above."

Specifically:\n\n- I think you need to state in Table 1 that a primal-dual extragradient can achieve O(1/k) rate for the squared tangent residual even for weak MVIs (so no need for a max-oracle). In that light, the contribution reduces to extending to Bregman divergences (by sacrificing a log factor).\n- I only noticed on a second read that the Bregman generator $h$ is required to be both strongly-convex and Lipschitz, which leaves out almost all interesting cases except for the euclidean case. Because of this is seems that even the extension to Bregman is vacuous.\n\nOn the technical side:\n\n- where do you prove that your update BPP is well-defined for weak MVI (A.3)? (It follows in the cohypomonotone case by Bauschke et al. 2019, but otherwise?)"

We have addressed the concern raised by the reviewer below.\n\n- As suggested, we will add the PDEG (next to EG+/CEG+) in Table 1.However, we would like to note that adding the PDEG does not weaken our contribution (which we clarified in our revision), as we already have mentioned EG+ and CEG+ in Table 1 that have the same $O(1/k)$ rate for the squared tangent residual and the computational complexity that is equivalent to the PDEG. We would like to also mention that PDEG is a Gauss-Seidel version of EG, and does not resemble PDHG, although the name looks similar. \n- The strong convexity and Lipschitzness conditions are indeed strong and satisfies only by the Euclidean distance among the existing list of Legendre functions $h$ (some of them are given in the bottom of page 2). We would like to emphasize again that our main contribution is to consider a new (strongly convex and smooth) Legendre function $h$ in (5) that is specifically designed for minimax problems, inspired by the PDHG. This led to the development of the SA gradient method.\n- Lemma 1 shows that $h$-resolvent is well defined for a strongly convex Legendre function $h$ (thus for our specific $h$ (5)) under the weak monotonicity (implied by the smoothness of $\\phi$)."

A few remarks:\n\n- I think its important to focus on the fact that the paper expands the range of $\\rho$ for an explicit scheme. I was admittedly late in noticing that it actually extended the range beyond what is currently known for e.g. EG+.\n- I understand now that the only Bregman case the paper is concerned with is the choice of $h$ in section 5.1. It would be instructive to compute the Bregman divergence in this particular. How much smaller can the Bregman divergence be in comparison with the square norm even in the best case?\n\nI still find the motivation through PGHD for the scheme somewhat vague. In practice we cannot expect to run the implicit scheme, SA, when beyond bilinear problems. So we have to resort to the inexact variant that suffers a logarithmic oracle factor, in which case it is much less clear whether the scheme is favorable from a computational perspective."

The proposed algorithm is based on the Bregman proximal point (BPP) algorithm, also resembles the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. The proposed algorithm consists of u and v substeps where the authors proposed using FISTA to solve the v substep approximately. Theoretical convergence is studied for this SA-MDGD algorithm and numerical experiments were provided to show the efficacy of the proposed method."

Is the sublinear rate as in Theorem 4, 5 or 6 show improvements over existing methods or achieve certain lower bounds? For example [1] seems to achieve similar sublinear rate. The authors could consider illustrating this in their Table 1.\n\n2. In numerical experiments, I\u2019m not sure if the authors implemented their SA-GDmax or the more practical SA-MGDA algorithm. If it\u2019s SA-GDmax as in (7), then how did the authors conduct the v substep precisely? Also for Figure 2, the authors claimed the parameter $\\tau=0.01$ in section 7.2 but presented two choices of $\\tau$, and from the left figure in Figure 2, $\\tau=0.01$ didn\u2019t show a statistical advantage of SA-GDmax over other works. Last, the authors didn\u2019t compare with a lot of the methods in Table 1, for which they should consider adding more numerical comparisons.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Diakonikolas, Jelena, Constantinos Daskalakis, and Michael I.

In particular, the max step of the fair classification problem is exactly maximizing a quadratic function over a simplex, or equivalently, an orthogonal projection problem to a simplex, given the value of the loss function for each category. This can be efficiently done in $O(d_v\\log(d_v))$, where $d_v$ is the dimension of $v$ (arXiv: 1309.1541). Note that the orthogonal projection to a simplex is also needed for other methods. / We agree that the experiment with $\\tau=0.01$ does not clearly show that our method is better, unlike the case with $\\tau=0.001$. We still shared the $\\tau=0.01$ result for transparency. / Among extragradient-type methods, we chose CEG+ that is known to work under the weakest condition we consider. We already have ran EG and EG+ and those worked poorly."

The advantage over EG+ and CEG+ in bounding the larger Bregman distance seems to disappear for SA-GDAmax with projection (Theorem 4) and the inexact SA-MGDA methods (Theorems 5 and 6). Other advantages? Also, I think the practical inexact SA-MGDA methods should also be included in the experiments. \n\n(2) The drawbacks of extragradient and advantages of PDHG could be briefly mentioned in the abstract and the beginning of the Introduction, instead of ''there is still room for improvement''. Also, in the abstract, is the ''worst-case convergence rate'' lacking in extragradient methods? If yes, you could mention this in the abstract. \n\n(3) What's your advantage over the works ''Fast extra gradient methods for smooth structured nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems'' and ''Stable Nonconvex-Nonconcave Training via Linear Interpolation''? You may cite the latter. \n\n(4) In ''This was studied on a general convex-concave problem, but it has not been found useful in a more general nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem. In this paper, we demonstrate its natural extension to a structured nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem'' in the abstract, ''it' and ''its'' are far away from PDHG and thus could be replaced by PDHG. \n\n(5) At the end of the second paragraph of the introduction, \"a new nonlinear variant of the PDHG, named semi-anchored (SA) gradient method\" could be clearer. \n\n(6) In page 4, in the sentence ''the GDmax minimizes the equivalent minimization problem'', ''minimizes'' could be changed to ''solves''. \n\n(7) How to compute $R(x)$? You could explain or cite in your paper. Can $R(x)$ be exactly solved? If not, it is recommended to include such an error in the convergence results. \n\n(8) In Section 4.3, you said ''This has several advantages over the standard BPP, which will be detailed later. '' Later I found only one advantage of a larger range of $\\rho$. Any other advantages? \n\n(9) In Section 5.1,  can we replace $\\widehat{L}$ with the previously defined $\\gamma$? \n\n(10) Right after as ''it resembles GDmax'', you could indicate that we can also obtain SA-GDmax with projection using BPP with projection (4) using h in (5). \n\n(11) In Theorem 3, ''SA-GDmax (i.e., SA-MGDA with $J=\\infty$)'' looks clearer. In Theorem 4, should it be ''SA-GDmax with projection''? \n\n(12) In the toy example, what's the function $\\phi$? Should it be $+\\frac{L^2\\rho}{4}u^2$ and $-\\frac{L^2\\rho}{4}v^2$ to correspond to $+f(u)$ and $-g(v)$ in the problem (1)?"

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's nice summary of our paper, detailed suggestions and constructive feedback.\n- (Q1-2) Regarding the clarification of our contributions, see our general comment. / As we have an efficient max-oracle for the experiments, the SA-GDmax is not impractical for our experiments and thus SA-MGDA does not seem necessary to be explicitly considered, which behave almost the same as the SA-GDmax.\n- (Q3) They are both interesting, as the former discusses the acceleration, and the latter studies last iterate convergence for the first-time in nonconvex-nonconave problems. However, they both assume the (negative-)comonotonicity that is stronger than the weak MVI that we assume, and how one can extend their results to the weak MVI seem interesting but unclear at the moment. We cited the latter one, next to the former.\n- (Q7) Computing $R(x)$ exactly and inexactly corresponds to SA-GDmax and SA-MGDA, respectively. In particular, the analysis for the inexact computation of $R(x)$ is provided in Theorems 5 and 6 for SA-MGDA (with and without projection). The explicit and detailed analysis of the inexactness of $R(x)$ can be found in Appendix D where we present the proofs of Theorems 5 and 6.\n- (Q8) As mentioned in the general comment, the projection technique was originally introduced to relax the bounded domain assumption in Theorem 5 of the SA-MGDA, which is now removed. So, now there is no advantage other than having a larger range of $\\rho$.\n- (Q9) You are right that they can be interchanged in the current form. To clarify this, we moved the definition of $\\hat{L}$ earlier in front of Assumption A2, and leave $\\gamma$ only for the definition of weak monotonicity.\n- (Q12) The considered function is $\\phi$, as written in the paper, and we forgot to inform $f(u)=g(v)=0$, which we added in the revision.\n- (Q4-6,Q10-11) Thanks for the corrections and the suggestions. We have revised accordingly."
