This is not so cool as the causal relationship modeling is the main story of this project, and the results suggest that the proposed causal modeling method may not be effective in D4RL. \n- The motivation of the Patch Transformer is not strong. Why do we need to introduce a new Patch Transformer for better image modeling, instead of utilizing the widely-used VIT here?"

To overcome this, GDT represents RL sequences as graph structures, effectively managing dependencies and long-term sequences. By integrating Graph and Sequence Transformers, GDT captures detailed spatial information. Experimental tests on Atari and OpenAI Gym show GDT's superior performance over existing methods."

The empirical evidence presented does not sufficiently demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, in the Atari games results, CQL records best scores in 2 out of 4 instances, while GDT scores the best once, and GDT-plus also once. Given that the patch transformer is specifically crafted for visual input environments, its contribution to the final results doesn't appear to be substantial.\n\n**Minor Concerns:**\n1. There are instances where figures are presented on pages different from their first mention. Notably, Figure 1, Table 1, and Table 2 are affected. It would be more reader-friendly if the authors reconsidered their placement for better clarity.\n2. The \"graph transformer\" component lacks a comprehensive explanation, and there are no supporting citations provided."

Specifically, this work employs a pre-defined dependency between state, action and reward tokens.

However, Section 3.2 is not easy to follow.\n \n   * I think there are some disconnections between Equations (1) (2) and actual attention mechanism, and how the proposed modification is applied to Transformer layers. Is the graph-based dependency considered every Transformer layer or is it only provided initially at the first layer? \n   * Also, the $r_* \\to r_*$ is learned should be clearly described.\n   * The notations should be clearly defined for Equations (1-4).\n\n2. **Soundness of proposed modified attention calculation.** I somehow understand the purpose is to fuse \"extra\" information, which referes to the enforced dependency we consider in RL context. Here are few questions:\n\n   * What's the reason of only adding this to key and query, and leaving value untouched? This seems to be different than usual design of \"cross-attention\", which uses external query and local (or \"self\") key and value.\n   * If the design can be supported by some experimental studies or theoratical justifications, it would be great to show its novelty and importance.\n   * The modified score function considers both directions of a dependency. I'm wondering whether there is information leak that violates the temporal ordering.\n   * Is the attention in Transformer layers still considering all tokens or masked according to the graph?\n\n3. **Some comparable (baseline) methods.** The usage of graph dependency is great. In this case, an off-the-shelf graph neural network (GNN) architecture could also create this embedding. What's the main difference between the proposed way and GNNs? Can such method be used to create embeddings for GDT?\n\n4. **Dependency designs.** The dependency is mainly RL-oriented. According to the figures, an action seems to dependent on the most recent return/reward. However, usually we model a policy $a=\\pi(s)$ that does not consider it. It will be great to support this point by experiments or justifications. Essentailly this would extend the experiments summaried in Figure 3 and 4.\n\n5. **Clarification on experimental settings.** In D4RL experiments, is GDT-plus using image inputs rather than state inputs? Then how it is compared to DT and TT for example?"

Specifically, if the next state only depends on the current state and the action, which strictly follows the Markovian property, why would the current action be conditioned on both state and reward-to-go? Though the ablation on the graph representation (Fig. 3) is acknowledged, it does not strongly support the claim of the advantage of the current edge setting, considering the number of total possible settings. The authors are encouraged to expose detailed results on ablations (e.g. exact performance on each task) and explore the edge connection setting in a more generalized way (e.g. learning-based or taking advantage of evolutionary search).\n\n2. When it comes to the architecture design, especially when merging the edge representation in a transformer layer, the authors mainly follow the architecture proposed by Cai & Lam 2020 and Yun 2019. Does this architecture benefit the learning process most? An ablation regarding graph transformer architecture is highly encouraged. Meanwhile, the contribution of this paper is more about applying a graph transformer to RL instead of proposing a new graph transformer architecture. To further eliminate confusion, the authors are encouraged to cite Cai & Lam 2020 again in the method section (3.2) and explicitly say this paper borrows the architecture design if that is the case. So that the contribution of this paper can be better highlighted.\n\n3.

The title of this paper does not hint at the problem the paper tries to solve.\n\n### Minor:\n \n1. The edge connections in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3 are somehow misleading because they don't reflect the connection between the state, action current reward-to-go, and the reward-to-go at the next timestamp.\n\n\n### Reference:\nDeng Cai and Wai Lam.
