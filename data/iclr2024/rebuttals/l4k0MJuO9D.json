                    "value": "This submission tackles the challenge of network confidence calibration within the domain of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The authors introduce a calibration framework known as Unsupervised Target Domain Calibration (UTDC). In its initial stage, UTDC applies an existing accuracy estimation technique to gauge the network's accuracy on the target domain. Subsequently, UTDC employs an existing post-hoc calibration method to directly align the network's confidence with the estimated accuracy on the target domain. The authors have conducted calibration experiments involving two distinct UDA methods across two UDA datasets. Their findings demonstrate the superior performance of UTDC when compared to existing calibration methods based on importance weighting."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The technical novelty is quite limited as the UTDC method is essentially a straightforward combination of existing techniques. As the authors themselves acknowledge, UTDC utilizes an established accuracy estimation method, for instance, [A], in the first step to estimate network accuracy on the target domain. In the second step, UTDC employs a well-established post-hoc calibration method, like [B], to calibrate the network using target data. \n\n2. The empirical evaluation is rather limited and, as a result, cannot sufficiently demonstrate the soundness, effectiveness, and generalizability of the proposed method. Reasons are: (1) The evaluation solely includes DANN and CDAN as UDA methods, both of which are founded on adversarial domain adaptation and cannot sufficiently represent the broader spectrum of UDA algorithms. It is necessary to incorporate various UDA methods, including those mentioned in the \"implementation details\" section by the authors, such as [C, D, E, F]. (2) The experiments are exclusively conducted on the Office-Home and Office-31 datasets, neglecting large-scale UDA datasets like VisDA [G] and DomainNet [H]. (3) The calibration experiments are limited to only two importance-weighting methods, without considering significant baselines like MC-Dropout [I] or Ensemble [J]. (4) The study lacks experiments exploring the replacement of the target-accuracy estimation method or the post-hoc calibration method with other choices, which could provide valuable insights.\n\n3. The proposed UTDC method lacks practicality for real-world UDA applications due to its complexity and limitations. A key aspect of UTDC is the use of the target accuracy estimation method [A] to estimate accuracy on the target domain. However, this method has several practical issues: (1) It involves the complex construction and modeling of numerous datasets, which can be computationally demanding, potentially exceeding the computational requirements of UDA model training. (2) It requires multiple method-specific hyperparameters, which can be challenging to determine in UDA settings. (3) It heavily depends on source data and is not applicable to more practical UDA scenarios, such as partial-set UDA [K] and source-free UDA [L].\n\nReferences:\n\n[A] Are labels always necessary for classifier accuracy evaluation?

Since the data from the target domain is unlabelled, it is difficult and not clear on how to obtain the target (domain) accuracy. Reliable target accuracy is required to accurately quantify the calibration performance via calibration metrics and optimize such metrics to find optimal scaling parameters for post-hoc calibration methods. The paper points out the limitations of importance weighting (IW) methods and directly estimates the target accuracy by leveraging an existing technique and use it to scale the bin-wise source accuracy for achieving the bin-wise target accuracy. This bin-wise target accuracy is then plugged into the adaptive ECE (adaECE) metric and this adaECE metric is optimized in order to search for optimal temperature scaling method. Experiments are computed on two different datasets: Office-Home and Office31 to validate the calibration performance of the proposed method. Results claim to surpass the existing the methods by significant margins."

                    "value": "- [*Motivation Ambiguity*] A calibrated model's prediction confidence should match its dataset accuracy. Why calibrate if we can just estimate the accuracy? Isn't the estimated accuracy alone sufficient for understanding model uncertainty?\n\n- [*Method Questionability*] Eq.4 assumes similar over/under confidence across bins to estimate each bin's accuracy. This assumption needs further justification. Why is it valid?\n\n- [*Accuracy Estimation Concerns*] Using (Deng & Zheng, 2021)) for accuracy estimation could be problematic for large datasets or significant distribution shifts. The reliability of this method, especially under these conditions, hasn't been thoroughly discussed. Exploring other accuracy estimation techniques might be beneficial.\n\n- [*Limited Datasets*] The chosen datasets for experiments seem small. Evaluations on standard benchmarks like ImageNet-C, CIFAR-C, and ImageNet-S are missing, making it challenging to determine the method's true advantage.\n\n- [*Comparison with Recent Techniques*] The manuscript could benefit from comparisons to recent calibration methods:  [a] Adaptive Calibrator Ensemble: Navigating Test Set Difficulty in Out-of-Distribution Scenarios. ICCV 2023\n[b] Robust calibration with multi-domain temperature scaling. In NeurIPS 2022\n[c] Beyond In-domain scenarios: robust density-aware calibration. In ICML 2023\n[d] Confidence calibration for domain generalization under covariate shift. In ICCV 2021"
