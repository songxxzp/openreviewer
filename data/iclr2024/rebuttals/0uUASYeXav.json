An interesting comparison would be to have a model-based baseline that uses structured world models, e.g. like the one proposed in Kipf et al."

                        "value": "Thank you for your valuable feedback. Please find our responses to your questions below.\n\n*[Performance of the OCRL baseline]*\n1. The GOCA and the OCRL baseline both use the same pretrained frozen SLATE model as an object-centric encoder. However, in the case of the VOYC color schema, on average, the OCRL baseline converges in only one out of three runs. We hypothesise that the transformer-based OCRL is more sensitive to the quality of the SLATE model. To potentially address this issue, increasing the number of training epochs for the SLATE on the VOYC dataset could be considered.\n2. We attempted to tune the OCRL baseline in the tasks where it was outperformed by GOCA. We went through combinations of hyperparameters, but did not observe significant improvements: entorpy_coefficient=[0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1], clip_range=[0.1, 0.2, 0.4], epochs=[10, 20, 30], batch_size=[64, 128].\n\n*[DreamerV3]* \\\nWe chose DreamerV3 to demonstrate that even a powerful monolithic model-based algorithm could be ourperformed by a simpler model-based algorithm such as GOCA, which utilizes the object-centric structure of the environment. We believe that an object-centric extension of DreamerV3 could potentially achieve better performance in the considered environments. However, to the best of our knowledge, no one has proposed such an extension yet. In fact, we have plans to develop an object-centric version of DreamerV3 ourselves. As there is no established SOTA for object-centric MBRL, we would greatly appreciate any suggestions regarding which algorithms we should use as baselines for our method.\n\n\nOur responses to the highlighted weaknesses:\n\n*[Environments]*\n1. Current SOTA slot-based object-centric models struggle in extracting meaningful object-centric representations in visually complex environments. Testing our RL approach in visually rich environments, such as Habitat [1] (proposed by Reviewer 6gyQ), becomes challenging because of low quality of representations. Visual complexity of the selected environments allows object-centric models extract good quality object representations. While our 2D environments adhere to standard object-centric RL tasks, they present more challenging dynamics compared to the environments where the transformer-based OCRL baseline was initially evaluated. For instance, in Navigation5x5 and PushingNoAgent5x5, there are four movable objects, whereas in Navigation10x10, there are seven movable objects. In contrast, the 2D environments [2] typically have one or two movable objects.\n2. Both the GOCA and the OCRL baseline use the same pretrained frozen SLATE model as an object-centric encoder. However, the OCRL baseline, on average, converges in one out of three runs for the VOYC color schema. We believe that the transformer-based OCRL is more sensitive to the quality of the SLATE model, and this issue can potentially be overcome by increasing the number of training epochs for the SLATE on VOYC dataset. \\\n[1] Szot el al. Habitat 2.0: Training Home Assistants to Rearrange their Habitat. 2021 \\\n[2] Jaesik Yoon et al. An Investigation into Pre-Training Object-Centric Representations for Reinforcement Learning, 2023\n\n*[Novelty]* \\\nWe will explicitly highlight the contribution here and in the revised version of the paper:\n1) We proposed a novel architecture that combines a value-based model-based approach with the actor-critic method.\n2) We extended the SAC algorithm by introducing a new objective function to train the model-based critic.\n3) We proposed using a GNN-based actor to pool object-centric representations.\n4) We modified the CSWM transition model by adjusting its edge model: we pass a pair of slots into the edge model along with an action."

I acknowledge that indeed there is no off-the-shelf object-centric, model-based algorithm readily available (i.e. an object-centric Dreamer). I appreciate the four explicit contributions stated in the comment, and the paper would vastly improve if it was more centered around these contributions. I would also expect these points to be addressed in the ablation study, i.e. can you quantify the effect of adjusting the CSWM edge model?\n\nHowever, given the current experimental results, it's still unclear how significant these improvements are. Considering also the other reviewer's feedback and discussion, I'm keeping my borderline score."

While it is interesting to see that this works, in the tested environments, a strong novel contribution seems to be missing from the paper.\n* **Evaluation**: the experiments in the paper are mainly limited to two tasks/environments (with variations). It is unclear what the authors are trying to show, as they mention `efficiency' but in the standard versions of the tasks the \"OCRL\" baseline seems to be more efficient, as it converges faster in the 5x5 Navigation task and it starts learning faster and converges to a similar result in the BGYR Object Reaching task.

Aren't they both based on SLATE for the encoding?]* \\\nBoth the GOCA and the OCRL baseline use the same pretrained frozen SLATE model as an object-centric encoder. However, the OCRL baseline, on average, converges in one out of three runs for the VOYC color schema. We believe that the transformer-based OCRL is more sensitive to the quality of the SLATE model, and this issue can potentially be overcome by increasing the number of training epochs for the SLATE on VOYC dataset.\n\n*[Comparison with DreamerV3]* \\\nPlease note that for the GOCA and the OCRL baseline, we only pretrain and freeze the object-centric encoder SLATE, not the world model. In order to ensure a fair comparison with DreamerV3, as you suggested, we conducted experiments where we trained DreamerV3 with a pretrained encoder obtained from the DreamerV3 model that solves the task. In all the tasks we considered, we tried both settings: where the encoder is frozen and where it is not frozen. However, we did not observe any improvement in the convergence rate. Additionally, we discovered that the pretrained world model significantly accelerates the convergence of DreamerV3, but this setting makes the comparison unfair to the GOCA.\n\n*[How many random steps from the environment are used for pretraining SLATE?]* \\\nFor the Shapes2D tasks, we pretrain the SLATE model using datasets consisting of 100K observations collected with a uniform random policy. As for the Object Reaching task, the dataset comprises 200K observations collected with a uniform random policy."

                        "value": "Our responses to the highlighted weaknesses:\n\n*[Model-based approach?]* \n1. We refer to our approach as a value-based **model-based** method, as we use a world model in the critic module to predict action-values. Namely, we employ decomposition: $ Q(s_t, a) = r_{WM}(s_t, a) + \\gamma V(s_{t + 1}) \\text{  and  } s_{t + 1} = T_{WM}(s_t, a) $.\n Our approach is inspired by the Q-learning TreeQN [1] algorithm, which applies a world model and a state-value model to estimate Q-values and demonstrates superior performance compared to DQN.\n2. Since we use the pre-trained frozen SLATE model to extract object-centric representations, the world model components do not affect representation learning, but the transition model is trained to predict representations for the next state. The next state representation prediction can be viewed as an imagination step in our approach. However, the actor and critic are trained using data from the replay buffer, which stores actual environment samples. \\\n[1] Gregory Farquhar et al. TreeQN and ATreeC: Differentiable Tree-Structured Models for Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2018.\n\n*[Novelty]* \\\nWe will explicitly highlight the contribution here and in the revised version of the paper as it is not clear for readers:\n1. We proposed a novel architecture that combines a value-based model-based approach with the actor-critic method.\n2. We extended the SAC algorithm by introducing a new objective function to train the model-based critic.\n3. We proposed using a GNN-based actor to pool object-centric representations.\n4. We modified the CSWM transition model by adjusting its edge model: we pass a pair of slots into the edge model along with an action.\n\n*[Evaluation. Environments]* \n1. Current SOTA slot-based object-centric models struggle in extracting meaningful object-centric representations in visually complex environments. Testing our RL approach in visually rich environments, such as Habitat [2] (proposed by Reviewer 6gyQ), becomes challenging because of low quality of representations. The recently introduced DINOSAUR [3] model seems suitable for visually rich environments, and we plan to conduct experiments with it. However, in this work, we focus on integrating slot-based representations and object-centric world model in a reinforcement learning algorithm, rather than on the improving of slot-based representation models themselves. Therefore, we have chosen to use standard for object-centric RL environments where current object-centric representation models perform well.\n2. By \"efficiency\" we mean that GOCA performs on par with model-free algorithms in simple tasks like Navigation5x5. However, it scales better as the number of objects increases (Navigation10x10) or the environment dynamics becomes more challenging (PushingNoAgent5x5). \\\n[2] Szot el al. Habitat 2.0: Training Home Assistants to Rearrange their Habitat. 2021 \\\n[3] Seitzer el al. Bridging the Gap to Real-World Object-Centric Learning. 2023\n\n*[Evaluation. If the approach is model-based, how are SAC-based approaches ablations?]* \\\nOur approach is built upon SAC, and thus, our ablation study aims to assess the impact of the different modifications we introduced to the original SAC (with a monolithic CNN encoder). Specifically, evaluated the contributions of the pretrained frozen SLATE encoder and the entropy tuning. Additionally, in the revised version of our paper, we will include a comparison with GNN-based SAC without a world model.\n\n*[Evaluation. How does the tuning of the entropy term cause such a large difference in performance?]* \\\nIt is a known issue that discrete SAC is sensitive to hyperparameters related to entropy [4, 5]. Since our approach is based on SAC so it also inherits this flaw. However, we consider this problem to be beyond the scope of our work. As part of our future plans, we intend to adopt a metagradient-based approach [6] that does not require the target entropy hyperparameter. \\\n[4] Yaosheng Xu, et. al.

I wouldn't call the approach value-based as it uses an actor-critic]* \\\nWe refer to our approach as a value-based model-free method, as we use a world model in the critic module to predict action-values."

However, I still feel a bit hesitant to recommend acceptance due to the limited evaluation, which doesn't really show a clear advantage in adopting GOCA compared to the baselines, even on these simple tasks."

                    "value": "I listed both the weaknesses and questions here.\n\n1. **[About model design]**\n\n- I recognize the potential of employing patch-based object-centric learning for extracting meaningful features for each object. However, there is a concern regarding the sufficiency of these learned factors in accurately modeling the dynamics and policy. Alternatives like deep latent particles [1] could potentially offer more straightforward features, facilitating more effective dynamics modeling. While it is not necessary to conduct experiments with these alternatives during the rebuttal phase, any additional clarification from the authors on how they ensure that the patch-based model can learn representations that are sufficient and robust enough for modeling the dynamics would be highly appreciated and beneficial.\n\n- In Fig. 2 and Section 4.2, it appears that the authors have adopted an assumption of dense interactions among objects, modeled using complete graphs. However, it is a well-acknowledged fact that interactions in real-world scenarios tend to occur sparsely rather than densely. While I know that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have the capability to emulate these naturally sparse interactions through their neural representations, there remains a question to me is why the authors chose not to explicitly model these interactions using a sparse graph, which could potentially provide a more direct and accurate representation of the interactions. One reference is [2]. \n\n2. Does the proposed method extend its applicability to more realistic scenarios, particularly in terms of generalization capabilities? Specifically, it would be insightful to understand if the method can generalize to scenarios involving a greater number of objects, novel objects, or additional object attributes (such as color) during the inference stage. One reference is [3]. \n\n3. **[About presentation]**\n\nThe paper demonstrates a clear presentation and logical flow throughout. However, there are several areas that could be enhanced for an even better presentation. Here are some suggestions for improvement:\n\n- I recommend making sections 3.1 and 3.2 to be shorter, given that they cover fundamental concepts in RL that the target audience is likely to be familiar with. By doing so, you can maintain the reader's focus on the core contributions of your work. You might consider moving the more detailed explanations to an appendix.\n\n- For all equations, I suggest employing a different text operation for \"node\" and \"edge\", maybe \\text{} or \\texttt{}, to clearly distinguish these terms from other variables and operations.\n\n\n- Check the citation formats, use \\citep and \\citet correctly. \n\n4. The current title, \"Graphical Actor Critic,  captures the aspect of the methodology, I recommend incorporating terms like  \"Relational\" to provide a clearer and more precise indication of the paper's focus. Given that the method does not directly learn or estimate graphical models, this adjustment would help set accurate expectations for the reader and align the title more closely with the paper\u2019s core contributions.\n\n*References*\n\n[1] Daniel, Tal, and Aviv Tamar. \"Unsupervised image representation learning with deep latent particles.\" ICML 2022.\n\n[2] Zadaianchuk, Andrii, Georg Martius, and Fanny Yang. \"Self-supervised reinforcement learning with independently controllable subgoals.\" CoRL 2022.\n\n[3] Zhou, Allan, et al. \"Policy architectures for compositional generalization in control.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.05960 (2022)."

Although there is still a gap when it comes to real-world data, STEVE [1] extends SLATE from static images to videos and has been proven to effectively model the temporal dynamics of each slot with good quality. Since the visual complexity of our environments is comparable to the complexity of the environments used to evaluate STEVE, we believe that in our experiments, SLATE representations contain enough information to model the dynamics. \\\n[1] Gautam Singh el al. Simple Unsupervised Object-Centric Learning for Complex and Naturalistic Videos. 2022\n\n*[Deep latent particles]* \\\n\"Deep latent particles\" is an interesting approach that is likely more robust for realistic images than SLATE. We trained the model on two datasets containing 100K images from Navigation5x5 and Navigation10x10 tasks, respectively. It accurately detects objects in Navigation5x5 images, but its quality significantly decreases in Navigation10x10 images. We plan to continue experimenting with this model and intend to integrate our approach with this non-slot object-centric model. However, this integration will require further investigation and implementation. We need to find a way to match the object representation from two consecutive states in order to train the transition model.\n\n*[Dense and sparse graphs]* \\\nWe acknowledge that representing the scene as a complete graph can often result in redundant connections. In the early stages of our research, we explored papers on approaches with sparse interactions between slots and attempted to implement our model with graph sparsification. However, this approach did not yield any improvements and introduced stability issues during training. We appreciate the paper you have suggested, and we will try to incorporate this approach into our model and evaluate its impact. \\\n[2] Anirudh Goyal et al. Neural Production Systems: Learning Rule-Governed Visual Dynamics. 2022\n\n*[Generalization capabilities]* \\\nThe CausalWorld environment, in which the Object Reaching task is implemented, enables the evaluation of an agent's generalization capability across various aspects of the environment. Although we did not specifically focus on the generalization task in this stage of the research, we have plans to conduct it in future stages.\n\n*[Titile]* \\\nIs our understanding correct that you are proposing to change the title to \"Relational Actor-Critic\". We are still thinking about keeping \"object-centric\" in the title, as it is an important aspect of the model.\n\n*[Comments on writing]* \\\nWe will incorporate your suggestions into the revised version of the paper, which we will provide before the end of the discussion phase."

Please find our responses to your questions below.\n\n*[How does the message passing happen and how does it scale with large graphs?]* \\\nSLATE model produces a set of slots, which are abstract state variables representing objects in the input image. These slots are then processed by GNN-based modules in the GOCA, including the actor model, state-value model, reward model, and transition model. Each GNN consists of two MLPs: an edge model and a node model. The edge model takes a pair of slots as input and produces an edge representation for them. The node model takes a slot as input, along with the sum of representations of all inbound edges, and produces a vector. This process can be seen as a single-step message passing framework, where information is conveyed from neighboring vertices to the current vertex. Since we treat the set of slots as a complete graph, the complexity of the procedure is quadratic in the number of slots, similar to the CSWM [2] transition model. In our experiments, it did not cause performance issues. \\\n[1] Gilmer et al. Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry. 2017 \\\n[2] Kipf el al. Contrastive Learning of Structured World Models. 2020\n\n*[How are the embedding dimensions come into?]* \\\nThe embedding dimension is the hyperparameter of the SLATE model, which is called 'Slot Dim' in the SLATE paper [3]. We tuned it to obtain a better representation for Object Reaching and Navigation10x10 environments. However, for Navigation5x5 and PushingNoAgent5x5 environments, we use the same model as they share the observation space. \\\n[3] Singh el al. Illiterate DALL-E Learns to Compose. 2022\n\n*[Should the losses be equally weighed? dVAE and cross entropy - after eqn 1.]* (We suppose that you meant equation 11.) \\\nWe did not use weights for losses but instead assigned different learning rates to the components of the SLATE model (dVAE, encoder, decoder). This is a more flexible approach to balance training between submodules that helps to speed up convergence.\n\n*[How do you plan to overcome the listed limitations?]* \n1. The first limitation is a deterministic world model, which may struggle to predict the dynamics of highly stochastic environments. To address the issue, we plan to develop an object-centric world model algorithm based on Dreamer V3, where the model explicitly maintains the deterministic and stochastic parts of the state.\n2. Entropy tuning. Our approach is based on the SAC algorithm. It is a known issue that discrete SAC is sensitive to entropy-related hyperparameters. We plan to adopt a metagradient-based approach [4] that does not require the target entropy hyperparameter. \\\n[4] Yufei Wang, Tianwei Ni.
