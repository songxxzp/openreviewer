They construct their benchmark from two sources: IBM's Business Conduct Guidelines and the Social Chemistry dataset. From these sources, they generate extensive-from games that embody different morals/ethics. They then evaluate a suite of LLMs on their ability to play these games. They additionally showed that a small-LLM fine-tuned on their dataset is able to achieve similar performance as a much larger LLM."

This is largely because they are often contextually defined.\n- It's not clear how the concepts sourced to generate games should constitute a benchmark and morality and ethics. \n  - The BCG is just a handbook for IBM. Why is this one handbook the choice? What were the other options? The sections of these things seem really abstract.\n  - Social Chemistry appears to not actually be a benchmark or definition of morality, but instead about compatibility between two agents. \n- How the games are constructed from the source datasets is not described, only the mechanics of playing a game.\n- There's no analysis of the constructed games, only the empirical performance of some LLMs. Recommend following at least a framework like \"Datasheets for Datasets\"."

                    "value": "- Sec 3.1, if the purpose of this work is to build a benchmark why are you filtering down the data?\n  - Why choose to filter specifically the harder examples that might provide better insights into the quality of the models?\n  - Could the authors provide more details as to how they deemed a question was too \"abstract\" and must be filtered? This seems like a point of failure, because authors opinions could overly influence the metrics.\n  - Please provide further details about the number of questions considered, the total number of final questions, and information about the set of withheld question and why they were withheld. \n  - How were the stories created that realized these different criteria? Why only one story? \n- Sec 3.1 and 3.2 are missing basic analysis into the input data and the constructed games. \n- It appears the aliases that were hand-constructed were essential for measuring the quality of current models. This unfairly biases the games to methods that were treated with this extra effort. Therefore, aliases must be further constructed for all future methods to ensure a more fair comparison --- where fair here is hard to quantify or ensure. \n  - For example, consider a new LLM that uses broken English, but has a high morality/ethical position. This method may perform disproportionally poorly. \n- Your results on the Flan models suggest a simple confounder for drawing any results of this dataset: it could simply measure a model's ability to follow instructions rather than its morality. I was hoping the authors might be able to speak more about this. \n \n**Nit**\n- There are issues with using `\\cite`, `\\citet`, and `\\citep`. \n- It seems like the font was modified.\n- Sec 1, Par 2, \"jailbroken\" not defined."

These cover a wide variety of individual scenarios across a more limited moral scope.\n\n* Section 3.2.2: added clarification on how games were created from the social chemistry dataset.\n\n  * \u201cThese stories are not necessarily based on the situations within this dataset; they are created manually by using the axes as inspiration for the story\u2019s topic.\u201c\n\n  * Our strategy was similar for BCG games.  We did not follow a precise method for creating games.  We primarily focused on a variety of relevant topics and created each scenario from one starting moral principle.\n\n* Section 3.2.1 (review refers to this as 3.1): reworded the sentence on filtering out some BCG topics to better reflect our intentions.\n\n  * \u201cIn our analysis, we looked for subsections of the BCG that focused on simple, grounded principles. Examples of these are \"avoid corrupt practices or bribery\" or \"be honest\". We focused on sections that were generalizable to most business environments, avoiding IBM-specific policies. In-game conversations are based off of the topics in these sections and are not taken directly from the document.\u201c\n\n* Clarification: this is a very good point.  While the Flan models are not the best at following instructions, they still demonstrate some directed moral reasoning.  Even as different orders of valid actions are presented, it still follows a series of similar paths on each game.  Although its moral reasoning is not the best on all metrics, it does consistently choose from a subset of actions rather than completely random instruction following.\n\n* Section 1: better defined what we consider a jailbreak.\n\n  * \u201cThese jailbreaks, exploits that can cause a model to ignore safety training and produce immoral/unethical output, represent a severe and tangible threat, even to those that do not directly interact with their models.\u201c\n\n* Changed \\cite to \\citep or \\citet where appropriate."

The definitions and considerations regarding moral principles in these games are robust, drawing from established booklists or datasets.\n- The authors conducted comprehensive experiments to assess the moral capabilities of leading open-source models.

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "About the Proposed Benchmark:\n- The authors mention that \"Each game is generally five to eight nodes deep, has between ten to twenty unique conversation states, and about ten unique triggers connecting these nodes.\"  Such a game's state space seems relatively basic to challenge the multi-step reasoning of language models. Perhaps for some leading commercial LLMs, this benchmark with a 5-8 level depth might be too simplistic. While the authors attribute this simplicity to the context window constraints of language models, advances in the field suggest there are methods to overcome this limitation. Introducing games of varied complexity, especially focusing on the number of dialogue rounds, could provide a more rigorous test for the moral reasoning of advanced models.\n- The game's moral scores are manually annotated. It is important to detail the selection and background of the annotators. Are they trained? How is their annotation accuracy evaluated, and are their annotation cross-validated?\n\nAbout the Experiments:\n- The explanation about the loss score (section 7.1) lacks clarity. Could you elucidate how the moral scores were normalized? It's a bit puzzling to see game scores ranging from -100 to 100 being mapped to -3 to 2. The authors mention that \"These scores were normalized and weighted so negative scores, \u22123 \u2264 norm_score \u2264 0, were more impactful than positive ones, 0 \u2264 norm_score \u2264 2.\" raises some questions. For the sake of model improvement, wouldn't it generally be beneficial to give more emphasis to positive samples during the fine-tuning process, leading to more significant weight adjustments?\n- The model was trained and evaluated on the proposed benchmark. This improved its performance on that dataset, but doesn't necessarily demonstrate its ability to generalize well. The authors also conducted experiments on other datasets. However, what is the distribution between these two datasets? Do they share similarities?\n- How was the temperature parameter of the model set in the experiments? Would different settings affect the evaluation results?\n- Would the input order of valid actions have any impact on the evaluation results? I seem to remember a study suggesting that the decisions of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 might be influenced by the sequence of the options given. Have you found similar observations?\n\nAbout the Writing:\n\nThis paper might benefit from some adjustments:\n- Incorrect citation format: cite/citep.\n- The section on related work could delve deeper into topics like text-based game benchmarks, LM for gameplay, and morality in LMs."

I noticed that the initial concepts of 'live games' and 'control' aren't revisited later on. Instead, terms like BCG games and social chemistry games are introduced. It would be great to understand their correlation.\n- How was the metric Win Rate determined?"

We format our changes in a similar ordering to yours so finding the changes that directly address your concerns should be easier.\n\n* Section 3.1: added a brief justification for our usage of smaller game sizes.\n\n  * \u201cOur goal with this structure was to make the game complex enough to be non-trivial yet simple enough to be navigated by language models while keeping their context windows small. This also facilitated quicker manual game creation. In our early testing, larger games or games with many choices per node yielded poor model performance since, even though the prompts did not fill the context windows, they were still long enough to confuse the models\u201c\n\n* Section 5.1: added more information about who the annotators were and measures to reduce bias.\n\n  * \u201cThese games were created and annotated manually by the authors with response scores.\u201c\n\n  * \u201cDiscussion between authors was held on scores to avoid significant bias.\u201c\n\n* Section 7.1: added clarification as to how the loss scores were normalized and weighted.\n\n  * \u201cFirst, these scores were normalized from [-100, 100] to [-1, 1]. Next, each score was also given one of two weights, one for positive scores and another for negative scores. We tried several different weights, but weighting negative scores by 3, $-3 \\le norm\\\\_score < 0$, and positive scores by 2, $0 \\le norm\\\\_score \\le 2$, yielded the best learning performance. This punishes the model for errors more harshly than a non-weighted loss. These scores were then used to create the final, biased loss.\u201c\n\n* Section 5.3: added a footnote to clarify the model temperature and sampling method.\n\n  * \u201cFor, inference during all tests, the models were set with a standard temperature of 0.7 and a sampling decoding method to allow models to generate different responses after generating an invalid response.\u201c\n\n* Section 5.1: added a clarification about how the valid actions are ordered when displayed.\n\n  * \u201cThe most notable of these is the \"help\" command. This command is used to display all possible responses to the current state of the conversation in an order that is randomized when each game is built.\u201c\n\n  * Randomization at build time allows for the elimination of significant human bias in the ordering while allowing for consistency at runtime.\n\n* Changed \\cite to \\citep or \\citet where appropriate.\n\n* Section 2: reworked the related works section to include more relevant papers and references.\n\n* Section 3: Changed the title to be more descriptive.\n\n  * \u201cThe Composition of Moral High Ground\u201c\n\n* Section 3.2: added clarification as to how games are categorized between SCM, BCG, live, and control.\n\n  * \u201cThe following games are broken into two sets of two categories. First, the games are split between Social Chemistry games and BCG games. Second, within both of these two sets, those marked with \u2217 are known as live games. These games present the model with a situation where some value is being violated or has the opportunity to be violated. Examples of these games are tbg-corrupt-1. The other games, marked with \u2020, are the control. These games are designed to be very close in theme and structure to their live counterparts with mundane, moral conversations. Examples include tbg-anti-corrupt-1. Failing a live game means that a model gave into the immoral speaker and failing a control game indicates that the agent sought out an immoral path.\u201c\n\n* Section 6: added information as to how win rate was calculated.\n\n  * \u201cHere, Win Rate measures the percentage of games where the player obtained a positive score.\u201c"
