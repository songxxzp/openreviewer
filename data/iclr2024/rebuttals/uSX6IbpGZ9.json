Then, the same independent constraints (Eq. (4) in (Hassanpour & Greiner, 2020)) are employed to learn balanced representations across various treatment arms. The framework proposed in this paper is identical to that proposed by Hassanpour & Greiner (2020), and the only difference is that this paper uses existing FEDformer (Zhou et al., 2022), DLinear (Zeng et al., 2023), and MICN (Wang et al., 2023) as representation networks."

The same loss function of the proposed causal structure could be found in Eqs. (3,4,5,6) in (Hassanpour & Greiner, 2020). \n\n**[Unclear]** The authors argue that existing methods introduce a certain degree of selection bias since the balance representations act as confounders for both treatment and outcomes. However, this paper still uses the same independent constraints (Eq. (4) in (Hassanpour & Greiner, 2020), IPM loss in (Shalit et al., 2017)), contradicting their own statement.\n\n**[Completeness 1]**  The problem settings in this paper are incomplete. The causal relationship between x, a, and y in the time series is not clear. Will the outcomes at time t+1 be influenced by all the historical data? Would using only past P time steps data lead to unmeasured confounding bias? Does the causal relationship between covariates X change over time? I suggest the authors to provide a causal diagram of the time series to further clarify the problem settings. Additionally, in the problem settings section, what is the impact of trend and seasonality on the causal relationship?\n\n**[Completeness 2]** The simulation mechanisms of (semi-)synthetic are incomplete, as the detailed implementations of the data generation processes are not provided in the main text or appendix. The author suggests referring to Melnychuk et al. (2022) for more information.\n\n[**Experiments**] This paper decomposes representations as Causal Trend and Causal Seasonality. However, how can we evaluate and demonstrate this? The experiments in the paper do not provide evidence for these statements."

However, we highlight below the difference between our work and the work of Hassanpour & Greiner (2020). While using similar causal structure and loss functions as in the work of Hassanpour & Greiner (2020), we studied the possibility of the trend/seasonality decomposed representations to reduce the selection bias under the time-series environment. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first decomposition based causal structure under the time-series setting.\n\n[Unclear]\nThe proposed causal structure employs a decomposed approach to learn the trend/seasonality representations, and the selection bias is minimized by making the causal representations be independent of the treatments. As a result, the proposed causal structure achieves better performance than the balanced representation algorithms (e.g., CRN and Causal Transformer).\n\n[Completeness 1, 2]\nThank you for your comment. We agree with Reviewer WhEV that the causal diagram between input, treatment, and outcome will clarify the problem settings. Furthermore, we will also provide the detailed implementations of the data generation processes in the main text or appendix.\n\n[Experiments]\nAs denoted by other reviewers, there are not enough theoretical justification of trend/seasonality decomposed representations in the manuscript. We will present theoretical analysis and experimental results to support the issue in the future. In addition, the causal seasonality representations can be plotted using t-SNE graph to validate the issue."

The proposed structure (Fig 1) is conceptually very similar to other network structures (e.g. Melnychuk et al 2022, Bica et al 2020), but with the additional of a generic trend/seasonality decomposition plug-in model. The primary innovation for the loss function appears to be the discrepancy function for seasonality, but the decision is not well motivated (why do we believe the seasonality induced by different interventions must be maximally different?).\n\nIt's not clear that the seasonality/trend decomposition actually recovers trends or seasonality. Either theoretical justification or additional experiments are necessary to confirm we recover the true decomposition.\n\nThree assumptions are given as standard, but are never explicitly leveraged, and it's not clear that the causal effects being measured are actually identifiable. \n\nFurthermore, the experiments focus on predictive accuracy without any evidence that the models are recovering the true causal effects. As mentioned in Bica et al 2020, evaluating decision making (correct treatment and timing) are critical to evaluate these systems.\n\nThe ablation study is focused wholly on removing components of the loss function, and only for one of the 3 plug-in models. Further ablation study for the network structure would be ideal.\n\nMinor issue: No attribution given for traditional decomposition methods, despite stating they are widely used. Traditional decomposition methods are also not leveraged as a comparison point in the experiments."

It introduces a trend/seasonality decomposition-based causal structure that reduces selection bias, a common issue in current methodologies.

The proposed method is thoroughly explained and appears to be based on sound principles and previous works. The authors also provide an evaluation using synthetic and real-world datasets, indicating a high-quality experimental setup.\n\nClarity: Despite the complex subject matter, the authors have done a good job of explaining their methodology and the motivation behind it. The language used is clear, and the paper is well-structured, making it easier for readers to follow the authors' thought process and understand the proposed solution.\n\nSignificance: The paper addresses a critical problem in time-series data analysis and causal effect estimation. The proposed solution could have a significant impact on various fields where time-series data plays a crucial role, such as finance, healthcare, and meteorology. By reducing selection bias and improving the accuracy of counterfactual outcome prediction, this work could potentially advance the state of the art in these areas."

Yet, the decomposition method, as shown in Fig. 1, has a causal trend $T_t$, which is also a confounder. In the balanced representation approach, the representation is trained not to be predictive of the treatment. However, in the proposed approach, the confounder $T_t$ is trained to be predictive of the treatment. It is hard to argue which approach has a greater selection bias. If some theoretical analysis or visualization of the latent space could provide some insights into this issue, the argument in this paper would be more convincing.\n- It is argued that the imbalance loss as in Eq. (11-12) could learn seasonality representations with no information about the treatment. This is not obvious and it needs more explanation regarding why minimizing the discrepancy could make $S_t$ independent of the treatment.\n- In experiments, no measure of uncertainty is provided. It is suggested to also report one of the following: standard deviation, confidence interval, or p-value.\n- It is unclear how the real dataset is used. Since counterfactual outcomes do not exist in real data, it is not clear what the \"real\" columns in Table 2 refer to."
