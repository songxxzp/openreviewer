In this perspective, test-time training is also conducted during training and can be considered as the inner-loop of meta-learning, with regular end-to-end learning forming the outer loop. The paper proposes a general framework for this setting (MTTT), and identifies that a minimal all-linear instantiation of MTTT is equivalent to linear attention. The paper studies different variants of the proposed MTTT on ImageNet (patchified and pixel-level)."

                    "value": "- the novelty of the proposed framework is limited as there exists at least one (uncited) prior work that has substantial overlap: \"MT3: Meta Test-Time Training for Self-Supervised Test-Time Adaption\", Alexander Bartler, Andre B\u00fchler, Felix Wiewel, Mario D\u00f6bler, Bin Yang, Proceedings of The 25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, PMLR 151:3080-3090, 2022. \n- the empirical analysis is limited to image classification on ImageNet (either on patches or on pixels). It would be helpful to consider domain shift settings (e.g. meta-learn on ImageNet, test on ImageNet-C/R etc.) or other tasks (e.g. semantic segmentation, object detection).\n- The reviewer is sceptical about using mini-batch SGD in the inner loop because, as discussed by the authors, the tokens are non-iid and it seems suboptimal to perform reconstruction on random subsets of the tokens in isolation. \n- while MTTT-Linear is interesting from a theoretical perspective due to its relationship to linear attention, it is otherwise questionable why test-time training would be performed layer-wise and not end-to-end. For instance, reconstruction of masked patches (a common proxy task) is unlikely solvable with a narrow 2-layer MLP (even when unrolled for T iterations). A more natural choice would be to apply test-time training to entire stem at once rather than to individual layers.\n- the author states \"For example, MTTT-Linear only takes 0.1\u00d7 more FLOPs than linear attention, but turns out\nto be 2\u00d7 slower in wall-clock time. In principle, the two are equivalent, so such difference can only be explained by systems-level inefficiencies.\". It is worth noting the FLOPS and wall-clock time are not equivalent and in many cases FLOPs is a poor proxy for inference latency. Overall, a more thorough empirical investigation of the runtime overhead of the proposed procedures would be helpful for practitioners.\n- minor: a graphical illustration of the proposed frameworks on the first pages would make the paper more accessible."

                    "value": "W1: Writing Clarity and Structure:\n\nOne of the primary concerns about this paper lies in its writing style. The introduction of the method is abrupt, lacking a detailed discussion of the learning or test-time training setting. The sub-sections appear disjointed, making it challenging to connect concepts such as inner loop and outer loop. Moreover, the excessive use of technical jargon renders the paper inaccessible to outsiders, hindering their understanding. Furthermore, the paper's heavy reliance on NLP motivation does not align with its evaluation on standard image classification\u2014a task less directly related to sequence modeling. The section discussing related work and the positioning of this paper is notably poor, leaving readers, even after multiple readings, struggling to discern the paper's stance and contributions.\n\nW2: Lack of Empirical Benefit and Motivation:\n\nAnother significant weakness is the absence of empirical benefits in the proposed approach. The paper fails to demonstrate improvements in accuracy or reductions in the number of parameters or computational FLOPs. While the authors express a lack of interest in leaderboard rankings, the introduction of their MTTT technique lacks a compelling rationale, leaving readers questioning its necessity and relevance. The absence of concrete empirical evidence undermines the paper's persuasiveness and impact, making it crucial for the authors to address this gap in their analysis to strengthen their argument effectively."

To enhance the understanding of this paper, it would be beneficial to include either an algorithm description or a framework figure.\n3. Test-time training has been demonstrated to enhance robustness against distribution shifts. The proposed TTT layer adjusts its parameters for each input instance. Therefore, why not compare the results when inputs contain corruptions or distribution shifts, as demonstrated in the experiments conducted in [b]?\n4. In the inner loop, the authors employ a reconstruction task as the test-time training method. There are various different schemes for test-time training. Why do the authors choose reconstruction as the training objective specifically?  \n5. Based on the results in Figure 1 and Table 3, it appears that a smaller reconstruction error leads to better accuracy. However, is this conclusion accurate? I believe it would be beneficial to conduct additional experiments to support that reducing reconstruction error has a positive impact on the final task.\n6. I think the TTT layer belongs to a specialized linear attention mechanism, so it's better to compare some recent works like [c].\n\n[a] Dynamic Neural Networks: A Survey.
