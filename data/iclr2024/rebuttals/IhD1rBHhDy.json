                        "value": "We thank you for your comprehensive review, your feedback has allowed us to greatly improve our work. We have made substantial text changes to the story. In the previous manuscript, we over-emphasized the narrative on dataset creation, when this was just a means to perform functional label-guided drug discovery. The revised manuscript has several key changes. First, we emphasize the importance of focusing on chemical function rather than structural nomenclature in the introduction and related work. Second, we introduce the concept of the chemical function landscape and through several analyses demonstrate that it is approximated by the CheF dataset. And third, we now outline the unique advantages that our proposed functional label-guided drug discovery has in comparison to existing text-based chemical models. We believe the reviewer feedback from all parties has greatly increased the quality of our paper, and we want to thank you for your valuable feedback.\n\nBelow, we address each of your points in detail.\n\n> It seems this paper only designs a dataset collection pipeline and no benchmark works are involved. [...] This reviewer thinks only the dataset construction contribution is not sufficient for publishing in ICLR. [\u2026] This reviewer thinks this paper might not be very suitable for the ICLR conference venues (machine learning conference). It is probably more suitable for the domain journal or other conference benchmark tracks if baseline evaluations are further included. \n\nWe understand your concerns on the focus of our paper, and we believe they reflect that we did not properly convey our work in the original submitted manuscript. Previously, we had focused too specifically on the dataset creation, when that was just a means to functional label-guided drug discovery which is, to our knowledge, a novel contribution to the field. To correct this shortcoming, we have overhauled the presented story to better explain the results of our contributions. You will find many text changes to the Abstract, Introduction, Results, and Discussion.\n\nWe believe our work serves instead to help build the foundations of functional label-guided drug discovery. First, we introduce the importance of focusing on chemical function, rather than structural nomenclature or miscellaneous terms. This is demonstrated with the creation of our Chemical Function dataset. Then, we introduce the concept of the text-based chemical function landscape, which was found to be highly structured by semantic functional categories (Figure 3). This text-based functional landscape aligned with chemical structural relationships, meaning that it adequately approximated the actual chemical function landscape, implicitly capturing complex physical and biochemical interactions (Figs. 2, 4). We then demonstrate that this functional landscape can be harnessed through a model trained to predict entire chemical functional profiles from structure alone. This model was able to comprehensively assign probabilities to every possible function that a given chemical may have, something that we do not believe has been done prior to our work. This has immense utility for experimentalists (hypothesis generation), pharmaceutical companies (discovery & repurposing), environmental agencies (off-target effects), and electronics manufacturers (photochemical discovery) to name a few.\n\nWe do realize that some aspects of technical rigor were not present in our original draft. To remedy this, we include additional supplemental figures analyzing the bias of the dataset (Fig. S3) and a benchmarking of molecular fingerprint-based models on the CheF dataset (Fig. S7).\n\nWe hope that you will find the revised manuscript and story satisfactory. We firmly believe that the work presented here is beneficial for the ML chemistry / biochemistry researchers attending ICLR, rather than a general chemistry audience.\n\n> [...] a complete benchmark work should include additional evaluations of some baseline methods. \n\nThis is a great suggestion, and the exclusion of such was an oversight on our end as we were focused on the analysis and practical utility of functional label-guided drug discovery rather than dataset creation. To address this, we have added evaluations of several baseline methods on the CheF dataset that may be found in Table S7. From this benchmark process, we found out our previous model was suboptimal. We now use a better model (multi-label logistic regression), and we have redone the relevant downstream analyses.\n\n(continued in next comment)"

                        "value": "Dear Author, \n\nThanks for your rebuttal! After careful reading over the rebuttal, we are mainly concerned about its significance and contribution. This reviewer believes that the functional label prediction task is an important task for real-application scenarios and biological/chemical research. However, the current contribution is not complete enough for an ICLR conference publication, considering this is a representation learning conference although the scope is definitely very wide. We think the best way to prove its significance is to show that some SOTA deep-learning approaches perform worse on the newly proposed benchmark since this is the only way to prove that the new task is a new challenge for current models. However, we only see some traditional and easy baseline approaches in rebuttal (even some easy approaches achieve very decent performance) and we truly think making a comprehensive and effective evaluation is not an easy thing that can be done immediately. \n\nIf the key point is more about the data mining techniques, then we think the technical contribution and novelty are probably very limited from a machine learning perspective. The current vision might be more suitable for a domain academic journal. \n\nTherefore, we are sorry to say that we will maintain our score and leave this decision to AC. In general, we acknowledge the solid contribution of this work to the domain research and we believe this work will be finally accepted after rounds of revisions. \n\nBest."

The proposed methodology uses GPT3.5 to summarise patents and extract functional labels, which are then cleaned and disambiguated by embedding them with a different GPT model and summarizing the clusters. The final labels are then mapped to the corresponding chemical structures of the chemicals associated with the patent. The authors create the Chemical Function (CheF) dataset, containing 100k molecules and the derived functional labels. They show that there is a relationship between the extracted labels and chemical structure of the molecules, by converting the molecules to molecular fingerprints and confirming clusters in the structural space correspond to functional labels when projecting with t-SNE. This finding is further validated by performing a similar analysis on the co-occurrence graph of functional labels. The paper also trains a function prediction model on the molecular fingerprints in the CheF dataset and demonstrates its utility qualitatively on a few real-life examples"

We have made substantial text changes to the story. In the previous manuscript, we over-emphasized the narrative on dataset creation, when this was just a means to perform functional label-guided drug discovery. The revised manuscript has several key changes. First, we emphasize the importance of focusing on chemical function rather than structural nomenclature in the introduction and related work. Second, we introduce the concept of the chemical function landscape and through several analyses demonstrate that it is approximated by the CheF dataset. And third, we now outline the unique advantages that our proposed functional label-guided drug discovery has in comparison to existing text-based chemical models. We believe the reviewer feedback from all parties has greatly increased the quality of our paper, and we want to thank you for your valuable feedback.\n\nBelow, we address each of your points in detail.\n\n> The paper assumes that chemical structures with similar functionality should cluster close to each other in the structural space based on molecular fingerprints; however, this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the case - you can have stereoisomers with different functional properties, and you can have chemical compounds with different chemical structure and similar labels. Some of this is visible in the cluster analyses, where molecules belonging to the same functional class are not clustered together. Perhaps a different metric to assess congruence of the two spaces is needed.\n\nThis is an excellent point. It is indeed true that chemical structures with similar functionalities do not always cluster closely in structural space, and conversely that structurally similar molecules may not always share functionality. An example of the former, as you pointed out, is the label HCV (Hepatitis C Virus) showing distinct clusters depending on mechanism of action (see Figure S3). A well-known example of the latter effect is the drug Thalidomide, which is either therapeutic or teratogenic depending on the stereoisomer. \n\nDespite this, derivatives of active drugs will often maintain their activity provided that the active moieties are maintained. This can be seen across the broad range of beta-lactam antibiotics. It is because of this generally-true property that patent offices allow for the patenting of molecules and their derivatives. And because the CheF dataset was built from patent data, we should expect to see clustering in structure space above random chance. However, we should not expect to see a single cluster for all molecules containing a given label, as some terms have multiple distinct mechanisms (i.e., beta-lactam antibiotics & tetracyclines both act as antibiotics despite different structure). Our metric accounts for this, as it measures distance to the nearest molecule with a shared label rather than measuring number of clusters. \n\nWe have further clarified the rationale for our introduced hypothesis, in which we add \u201cDue to molecules and their derivatives being patented together, structurally similar molecules should be annotated with similar patent-derived functions. This rationale generally holds, but exceptions include stereoisomers with different functions and distinct structures sharing the same function\u201d.\n\n> How is this effort different from recent work on molecular generation from chemical subspaces derived from patents containing specific functional keywords (Subramanian, 2023)?\n\nWe have rewritten the paragraph comparing our work to Subramanian 2023 to better clarify commonalities and differences. The revised paragraph reads as follows:\n\n\u201cRecent work also focused on molecular generation from chemical subspaces derived from patents containing specific functional keywords, for example, all molecules relating to tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity (Subramanian et al., 2023). This allows for a model that can generate potential tyrosine kinase inhibitors but would need to be retrained to predict molecules of a different functional label. In our work, we focus on label classification rather than molecular generation. Further, we integrate multiple functional labels for any given molecule, allowing us to broadly infer molecular functionality given structure. Generative models could be trained on the described dataset, allowing for label-guided molecular generation without re-training for each label.\u201d\n\n(continued in next comment)"

It appears the sentence stopped short.\n\n> Detailed figure of the pipeline (may be with a brief example of a patent) may be easier for readers understanding (Figure 1)\n\nWe recognize the importance of visual aids for those unfamiliar with patents. To aid this, we have added a figure outlining the summarization process for a specific example which may be found in Figure S2.\n\n> Can more validations be carried out by searching over the pubmed?\n\nIn our paper, we use PubMed articles to confirm our model-derived hypothesis of the Hepatitis C Virus antiviral\u2019s mechanism of action (Section 3.4). If you were instead referring to the idea that we should expand our data to PubMed-associated molecules, we completely agree and thank you for the suggestion. To note this in the paper, we have added a sentence to the discussion that reads \u201cAdditionally, by restricting the dataset to chemicals with <10 patents, it neglects important well-studied molecules like Penicillin. The inclusion of over-patented chemicals could be accomplished by using only the most abundant k terms for a given molecule, using a fine-tuned LLM to only summarize patents relevant to molecular function (ignoring irrelevant patents on applications like medical devices), or employing other data sources like PubChem or PubMed to fill in these gaps\u201d. We aim to pursue this idea in future work.\n\n> Would it be possible to employ the connection of chemicals with genes or diseases to extend the usage in drug repositioning or drug combinations?\n\nThis is an excellent suggestion, and it is exactly where we are headed in continuations of this project. We believe these relationships can be unified with our CheF dataset, allowing for the discovery of new chemical-gene and chemical-disease relationships via commonalities in patent word space. To note this in the paper, we have added a sentence to the discussion that reads \u201cFurther quality increases may result from integration of well-documented chemical-gene and chemical-disease relationships into CheF\u201d.\n\n> In using LLMs, were there any bias in the generated summarizations?\n\nThere were no obvious biases in the generated summarizations. To confirm this, we analyze the distribution of the generated (uncleaned) labels based on abundance. These appear to reflect underlying biases in the patent literature, and more broadly pharmaceutical incentives, rather than from the LLM. This analysis may be found in Figure S3.\n\n> What was the reason for using the Tanimoto similarity?\n\nTanimoto similarity is the standard method to compute similarity between binary molecular fingerprint vectors, see D\u00e1vid Bajusz (2015). This allows us to compute similarity whether or not the molecule contains a particular substructure. If we had been using float-valued vector representations (i.e., learned molecular embeddings), we would have opted for a more fitting similarity metric such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. To clarify this, we have added a citation of the metric at its first mention.\n\n> How long (in terms of time) does the whole framework take?\n\nThe framework is largely limited by the API calls to retrieve a patent and summarize it with ChatGPT. We report the results of this in the Methods section: \u201cFetching patent information and summarizing with ChatGPT, this method\u2019s bottleneck, took 6 seconds per molecule with 16 CPUs in parallel. This could be sped up to 3.9 seconds by summarizing per-patent rather than per-molecule to avoid redundant summarizations, and even further to 2.6 seconds by using only US and WO patents\u201d."

As such, the manuscript might find a more fitting audience in journals or conferences with a chemistry focus.\n\nWe acknowledge your concerns on the scope of our paper and believe it means that we did not properly convey our work in the original submitted manuscript. Previously, we had focused too specifically on the dataset creation, when that was just a means to functional label-guided drug discovery which is, to our knowledge, a novel contribution to the field. To correct this, we have edited each section to better relate our contributions. \n\nWe believe our work helps build the foundations of functional label-guided drug discovery. First, we introduce the importance of focusing on chemical function, rather than structural nomenclature or miscellaneous terms. This is demonstrated with the creation of our Chemical Function dataset. Then, we introduce the concept of the text-based chemical function landscape, which was found to be highly structured by semantic functional categories (Figure 3). This text-based functional landscape aligned with chemical structural relationships, meaning that it adequately approximated the actual chemical function landscape, implicitly capturing complex physical and biochemical interactions (Figs. 2, 4). We then demonstrate that this functional landscape can be harnessed through a model trained to predict entire chemical functional profiles from structure alone. This model was able to comprehensively assign probabilities to every possible function that a given chemical may have, something that we do not believe has been done prior to our work. This has utility for experimentalists (hypothesis generation), pharmaceutical companies (discovery and repurposing), environmental agencies (off-target effects), and electronics manufacturers (photochemical discovery) to name a few.\n\nWe do realize that some aspects of technical rigor were not present in our original draft. To remedy this, we now include additional supplemental figures analyzing the bias of the dataset (Fig. S3) and a benchmarking of molecular fingerprint-based models on the CheF dataset (Fig. S7).\n\nWe hope that you will find the revised manuscript satisfactory. We believe that the work is beneficial for the ML chemistry / biochemistry researchers attending ICLR, rather than a general chemistry audience.\n\n> There are concerns regarding the accuracy of labels generated by ChatGPT. While 98.2% of the labels were found valid, solutions for addressing the remaining 1.8% are not discussed. Such inaccuracies could introduce noise into the CheF dataset.\n\nWe agree that despite the high base accuracy of 98.2%, addressing the 1.8% of inaccuracies is indeed important. It is likely that fine-tuning an LLM on high-quality patent-extract functional data will increase this accuracy even higher, thereby enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the CheF dataset. A sentence has been added to the discussion to note this: \u201cIncreasing label quality and ignoring extraneous claims might be achieved through an LLM fine-tuned on high-quality examples\u201d.\n\n(continued in next comment)"
