I would like the authors to discuss about it, especially, the dependence on feature dimension $d$, $\\lambda$ in Assumption 1, the minimal singluar value of $A_{\\theta_t}$ (or say $\\mu$ in Assumption 5). \nBesides, I'm also curious if there is any dependence on something like $\\frac{1}{\\min_s \\mu_{\\theta}(s)}$, i.e. the probability to reach some states.\n\n2. Assumption 5 is quite unnatural to me, especially $A_{\\theta_t}$ is a non-symmetric matrix. Although the authors claim that it standard, I wonder if the authors could provide some concrete examples?\nIt seems that this assumption is important to make sure the some places in the proofs can go through, which implies the results are kind of limited given that the assumption can be very hard to verify in practice.\n\n3. The authors motivates the single-loop methods is because it is \"more practical\" comparing with double-loop methods. I would suggest the authors provide some experiments (even in toy example) to compare with previous double-loop methods.\n\n4. The authors claim that the main challenge is that \"the estimation errors of the Fisher information matrix, critic, and the policy gradient are strongly coupled\". However, it seems to me that this challenge is kind of artificial. Actually, in Algorithm 4, it is possible to generate three independent $(s,a)$ pairs from $\\mu_{\\pi_\\theta}$ and update $F_t,\\theta_t,w_t$ with one of those samples, and there will be no correlation between updates of actor, critic and fisher matrix. Moreover, such process will only increase the sample complexity by a factor of 3, which is constant.\n\n5. Others\n\n* It seems the $\\lambda$ denotes regularization coefficient in the update rule of $\\theta_t$ while denotes mixing parameter in Assumption 1, please avoid that."

                        "value": "Thank you for the insightful comment! We will address your concerns as follows:\n 1.  Assumption 5 is a standard assumption which has been commonly assumed in the literature. The assumption holds if the policy \\pi_\\theta can explore all state-action pairs in the tabular case. For example, if we assume $\\pi(a|s) > \\epsilon$, then assumption 5 holds with $\\mu = \\epsilon$.\n 2.  Dependence on key parameters: the dependence on \\mu is $O(1/\\mu^2)$, and the dependence on $\\lambda$ is $O(T^{-1/2} \\lambda^2 + \\lambda^{-1})$\n 3.  We want to note that the hardness of handling actor, critic, and fisher matrix is not from the correlation of (s_t, a_t) pairs, but from the update form of these three objects. They all need to update themselves using the other two estimated values. Then if one estimation error is large will cause the other two terms to explode too. Relationships of these three terms are shown in Lemma 3, 4, 5. These coupled problem exist even if we use three independent (s, a) pairs to update.\n4. The assumption that the algorithm uses the i.i.d. sample to update at each step has been replaced by a more realistic Makovian sample in the updated version (pages 22 - 24). This helps the algorithm be more practical. A refined analysis is also shown in the updated version."

But many steps are skipped and there are undefined constants, which make the proof hard to track. Maybe the details are in the proof for Lemma 2?\n2.\tThe proof for Lemma 5.

I think for the last term |F(\\theta_{t+1}) \u2013 F(\\theta_t)|^2, there should be some coefficient like 1/\\zeta_t, which will make the proof harder.\n\nMinor problems or typo:\nPage 1.

I think the paper \u201cNatural Actor-Critic\u201d (Neurocomputing 2008) gives a good explanation, but I am not sure if this is what the authors mean.\nPage 3 about \\mu_theta. The definition of \\mu_theta is not a distribution, but the visitation frequency. It is better to add a factor (1-\\gamma). Also, I don\u2019t think \\mu_theta depend on a.\nPage 3 and later.

Indeed this assumption of sampling from stationary distribution can be replaced by a more realistic Markovian sampling and only an additional $O(\\log^2 T)$ term is added. The proof detailed is shown in the updated version (page 22 - 24, Appendix B).\n 2.  Sorry for the confusion of the proof of Lemma 5. The proof is carefully refined and updated in the submission (page 18). Additional term $\\langle F_t - F(\\theta_t), F(\\theta_{t+1}-F(\\theta_t)) \\rangle$ is added in the right side of inequality but it does not affect the $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ order.\n 3.  Though there is an O(\\epsilon^{-1}) gap between the SOTA global optimum, it is worth noting that we are the first to derive the global optimal guarantee for the single-timescale algorithm.

The analysis builds on two lines of recent work: (1) finite-time analyses of single-timescale, single-sample actor-critic, and (2) finite-time analyses of natural actor-critic. The paper provides two main results for single-timescale, single-sample NAC: (Theorem 1) an $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity for (approximately) obtaining a stationary point of the discounted reward objective; (Theorem 2) an $O(\\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity for achieving global optimality (up to errors resulting from the actor and critic approximations). The work provides the first analysis of single-timescale, single-sample NAC. Theorem 1 matches the sample complexity of the two-timescale mini-batch NAC analyzed in [Xu et al., 2020] and Theorem 2 falls short of the $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity of two-timescale mini-batch NAC in [Xu et al., 2020]. Like [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022] (but unlike [Xu et al., 2020]), the analysis relies on the assumption that samples are drawn directly from the stationary distribution of the current policy at each timestep."

This is likely of interest to the theoretical RL community. The primary novelty in the analysis (cf., Theorem 1 and Sec. 5) is the incorporation of the Fisher information matrix estimation error into existing expressions for the critic and actor errors, and subsequent analysis as an interconnected system of inequalities (reminiscent of the techniques considered in [Chen & Zhao, 2023], [Wu et al., 2020], [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022]). Augmenting existing interconnected system analyses to accommodate the Fisher information appears to require a non-trivial amount of additional algebraic manipulation."

                    "value": "Though this work addresses an existing gap in the literature, there are significant weaknesses:\n1. It is assumed in the analysis that the algorithm samples state-action pairs from the stationary distribution induced by the current policy, $\\pi_{\\theta_t}$, at each timestep (see Remark 2, page 4). This is in keeping with [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022], but it is an unrealistic assumption. Furthermore, many recent works -- [Chen & Zhao, 2023], [Wu et al., 2020], [Xu et al., 2020] from the references, as well as [Suttle et al., *Beyond exponentially fast mixing in average-reward reinforcement learning via multi-level Monte Carlo actor-critic*, ICML 2023] -- provide analyses that do not require this assumption. The fact that the analyses provided in this paper only match (Theorem 1) or underperform (Theorem 2) existing results that do not require the stationary sampling assumption undermines the significance of the results.\n2. It is difficult to understand from the presentation provided in the paper how the analysis provided is related to existing analyses. The proof of Theorem 1 appears to be based on [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022], potentially with influence from [Chen & Zhao, 2023] and others, while the proof of Theorem 2 appears to borrow heavily from the analogous result in [Xu et al., 2020]. However, these relationships are not clearly discussed, making it very difficult to accurately evaluate the contribution of the paper.\n3. The fact that the analyses provided in this paper only match (Theorem 1) or underperform (Theorem 2) existing results indicates that there is some \"slack\" in the kind of analysis used, beyond the stationary sampling assumption. A clear explanation of the reasons for this slackness would be helpful, as it would clarify that limitations of the analysis and provide scope for future work.\n4. If the relationship of the analysis to previous work described in 2 above is accurate, then the main novelty in the analysis appears to be handling the introduction of Fisher information matrix estimation error in Theorem 1 (also see first sentence of second paragraph in the conclusion). Though potentially laborious, this would boil down to reworking the algebra of existing analyses, which would be a minor contribution. A more thorough discussion of the key innovations in the analysis is needed to help the reader better understand the significance of this work."

In the double loop algorithm, one can choose the $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ length for inner loop to obtain $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\omega_t - \\omega_{\\theta_t} \\| ]^2 < \\epsilon^2$ and $O(1/\\epsilon)$ length for outer loop. This leads to the final $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity. However, it is important to note that they can not guarantee $O(\\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity to obtain the stationary point and $O(\\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity to obtain the global optimum at the same time. While we use the same time-step to hold the two bounds simultaneously.\n2.  We thank the reviewer for pointing out that the algorithm samples state-action pairs from the stationary distribution induced by the current policy is a very strong assumption. Indeed we have removed this assumption and given the refined analysis in the updated PDF (Appendix B). Additional $O(\\log ^2 T)$ order is added to attain the stationary point and  $O(\\log T)$ order is added to attain the global optimum.\n3.  The reason for obtaining the global optimality for natural policy gradient is that we can show from the performance difference lemma that the difference between the optimal value function V^\\ast and V^t can be bounded by the  KL divergence between the optimal policy and current policy, which is directly optimized by NPG rather than PG. Thus we can then show the monotonic performance improvement of NPG and the global optimality. The analysis builds on [1] and we extend it to the NAC analysis.\n4.  Relationship with prior work: We want to clarify that the recursion relation of the critic update is inspired by [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022], and the analysis to obtain the global optimum is based on the two-timescale analysis for NAC in [Xu et al., 2020]. However, it is important to note that the analysis for actor update and the estimated fisher information matrix is novel in this paper. The analysis to attain the stationary point by handling the three deeply coupled terms is also new and non-trivial compared to [Olshevsky & Gharesifard, 2022], which only handles two coupled terms.\n5.  The design \\lambda I in the actor update is to prevent the estimated Fisher information matrix from being non-singular. In the Theorem 1 is of order $O(1 / \\lambda^2)$. In Theorem 2, the dependence on \\lambda is $O(T^{-1/4}+T^{-1/2} \\lambda^{-2} + \\lambda)$.\n6.  The actor stepsize we choose is $O(1 / \\sqrt{t})$, which is in the same order as the critic update and Fisher information matrix update. In the two timescale update, the actor stepsize is chosen as $O(1 / t^{3/5})$ and the critic stepsize is $O(1 / t^{2/5})$. Note that the choice of  $O(1 / \\sqrt{t})$ is standard in the literature of online learning such as the online mirror descent algorithm and follows the regularized leader algorithm.\n\n[1] Xuyang Chen and Lin Zhao.

                        "value": "Thanks to the authors for their responses. Parts 1, 3, 5, and 6 are clarifying. Regarding 2, I appreciate the attempt in the new Section B to adapt [Chen & Zhao, 2022] to eliminate the stationary sampling assumption. However, the total variation bound must be propagated throughout the analysis to ensure that the occupancy measure \"drift\" arising from the changing policy parameters and the consequent biases in the policy gradient, Fisher information, and critic estimates remain manageable. Regarding 4, though I sincerely appreciate the additional discussion of the relationship to existing work, I am still unclear exactly what key innovations over previous works are required in the analysis. I remain concerned that, as pointed out in part 4 of the Weaknesses section in my review, the primary effort involved a simple reworking of the algebra in the actor-critic analysis to handle the Fisher information matrix estimation. In light of these remaining issues, I will keep my score."
