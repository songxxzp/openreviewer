                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1, The reason this multi-modal model can achieve SOTA results on several datasets is fundamentally due to the use of embeddings from pre-trained models (such as CLIP embeddings), rather than the inherent superiority of the proposed training method itself. If you want to demonstrate how good your proposed training method is, different training methods should be applied with the same backbones. For the reasons mentioned above, I find the significance of Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 to be quite limited because the performance improvement is not a result of your paper's new method but rather the utilization of pre-trained models from previous works.\n\n2, In Table 6, when comparing the proposed method with Ma et al., I believe there is a significant misconception here. You used the CLIP model pre-trained on a large-scale text-image dataset by OpenAI, while Ma et al. used the ViLT backbone. The absolute performance of the model in this paper is better than Ma et al., which may be due to the superiority of CLIP over ViLT, rather than the training method proposed in this paper is better than Ma et al.'s method. **A more accurate comparison should be based on the proportion of performance degradation.**   Specifically, when 10% of the text is missing, Gazelle shows a decrease of (94.6-93.2)/(94.6-81.7)=10.85%, while Ma et al. exhibits a decrease of (92.0-90.5)/(92.0-71.5)=7.32%. From this perspective, when 10% of the text is absent, Ma et al. experience a relatively smaller proportion of decrease. Your higher absolute performance is simply due to the use of stronger pre-trained model embeddings, not because your proposed method is superior.\n\n3, The results in Table 6 for Hateful meme, where having 50% text performs better than having 70% text, and where 0% text and 10% text yield the same performance, are indeed puzzling. This could suggest that the method proposed in this paper may not make optimal use of the available text data.\n\n4, The method proposed in this paper requires that the sizes of features from different modalities remain consistent, which actually limits the flexibility of the entire model. For example, it may prevent the combination of BERT-Large and ViT-B."

                        "value": "**W1 (SOTA performances)**.  It is partly correct that the strength of the embedding used will have a direct impact on the performance of our network. However, the robustness to missing modality is due to the single branch network with weight sharing which is the main contribution of our work (Tables 6 and 7). \n\nIn addition, Unimodal image only performance with CLIP on UPMC Food-101 is 81.7. Whereas, multimodal performance with Gazelle is 94.6 which is 12.9% higher than CLIP unimodal image only. Similarly,  unimodal image-only performance with CLIP on Hateful Memes is 68.2. Whereas, multimodal performance with Gazelle is 72.5 which is 4.3% higher than CLIP unimodal image only. This clearly establishes the performance improvements our approach yields on top of a pre-trained CLIP embeddings.\n\nFurthermore, the Two-branch model in Tables 6 and 7 is by design a baseline two-branch model that is trained on the same CLIP features without our proposed weight sharing and training. As seen, our approach consistently outperforms the two-branch model in all settings/scenarios. While the selection of features does play a part (we analyzed it in Table 8), the comparison with the Two-branch network clearly highlights that CLIP features are not the sole reason for performance improvement in our proposed approach.\n\n**W2 (Percentage deterioration - Evaluation metric)**.  Can the reviewer provide any reference for the evaluation metric they are suggesting to evaluate the missing modality scenarios? \n\nAs for us, we follow the exact same \\% drop evaluation metric as used by Ma et al. to measure performance deterioration in case of missing modality. As seen in Ma et al., $\\%$ drop in performance can be measured as: $\\Delta \\downarrow$  $=(P_{complete}-P_{missing})/P_{complete}$, where $P_{complete}$ and $P_{missing}$ are the performances over complete and missing modalities. \n\nIn addition, let's suppose we have two deployed multimodal classification networks. Classification performances of network **a** and **b**  are 90.0 and 80.0 respectively when both modalities are present. In case of a missing modality, the classification performances of network **a**  and **b**  are 83.0 and 78.0 respectively. Though network **b** is more robust, its performance is still lower than network **a** and wouldn't be preferred for deployment.\n\n***W3 (Variation in Hateful Memes results)**. We suggest this is due to the nature of the Hateful Memes dataset. It is a binary multimodal classification dataset with imbalance classes which equates to small variation in the results when modality is missed randomly between two experiments. Similar observations are common in missing modality literature, for example, Figure 3 (in the middle summarizing Hateful Meme dataset results) in Supplementary material of Lee et al. 2023.\n\n***W4 (Limitations)**.  Gazelle utilizes a modality switching mechanism leveraging weight sharing across multiple modalities with a single-branch network. Such a design requires extracted representations from modality-specific networks to have the same embedding size. We can perform a transformation of the embedding to the required size. However, this requires further experimentation and is out of the scope of our work."

First, it states \"...sequential fashion. It is achieved by introducing a modality switching mechanism that determines the order in which embeddings are input to the single-branch network.\" What are the theoretical foundations for this? why is this used? what is the motivation and intuition behind it? Next, the paper states that they have three possible strategies: 1- randomly switching, 2- swishing between multimodal and unimodal 50-50, 3- going only with unimodal. Yet, no details are provided. Which of these are the proposed method? Is the paper simply exploring three options? Are there no other options? why not set the ratio as a hyperparameter and optimize it?\n\n- The entire method is basically explained in a single paragraph, making it almost impossible to understand the details, fundamental theories and motivations behind things, etc.\n\n- The methods used for comparison in Tables 2 through 5 have many important papers missing.\n\n- Especially for the missing modality experiments, only 1 comparison is done (against Ma et al., 2022).

We can rephrase the first sentence in the introduction with \"Recent years have seen a surge in the usage of multimodal data in various applications. For instance, users combine text, image, audio or video modalities to sell a product over an e-commerce platform or express views on social media platforms.\"\"\n\n **W2 (Important references missing)**. Both suggested references are cited in our submission. For the record, the work ''Are multimodal transformers robust to missing modality?'' is referenced at least  **17** times in our manuscript. Therefore, we humbly suggest the reviewer to read our submission again. \n\n **W3 (Method section)**.  **Intuition** In existing multimodal methods, the performance deterioration in the case of missing modalities is attributed to the commonly used multi-branch design.  Such a design may learn weights in a way that the final performance is highly dependent on the correct combination of input modalities. \nThus, we propose to input one modality to the network at a time making the network independent of the complete modality combination. To achieve this goal, we design a modality switching mechanism that selects input sequence to the network. \n\nWe explore three possible modality switching strategies to study their effect on complete as well as missing modalities. The results reported in our manuscript use the S-1 training strategy unless otherwise mentioned. We have provided details of modality switching in Section 3.2 along with a Figure. \n\n**W3 (Entire method is basically explained in a single paragraph)**.   There are three Subsections of our proposed approach. In Subsection 3.1, we formally provide details on the input data, Subsection 3.2 provides details on modality switch.

They are indeed in the paper. I will update my score from \"strong reject\" to \"reject\" in light of this. \n\nThe authors did not respond to my question: \"Are there no other [modality switching] options? why not set the ratio as a hyperparameter and optimize it?\" In essence, the design choices seem arbitrary - they should be better justified, learned, and/or exhaustively tuned.\n\nI also still have concerns, especially regarding the description of the proposed method. I agree with Reviewer ZSk2 that in the absence of a clear theoretical framework for why this should result in better training, the approach can be considered a training trick in its current format. This can be alleviated by providing some theoretical work on why the proposed approach results in a more discriminative joint embedding space. Alternatively, the method can be combined with a few other tricks/small contributions to have a more substantial impact and become a more coherent framework."

                        "value": "**W1 (Review of the topic)**. We have provided a comprehensive overview of related work in Section 2. We would highly appreciate it if the reviewer could provide specific details on any missing references. \n\n**W2 (Intuition)**. In existing methods, the performance deterioration in the case of missing modalities may be attributed to the commonly used multi-branch design. \nSuch a design may learn weights in a way that the final performance is highly dependent on the correct combination of input modalities. \nModality switching mechanism is an important component of our method that enables providing input modalities in a sequential fashion so that a single branch network is able to learn from both modalities without any dependence on complete set of modalities. We propose three modality switches to find the best combination of input modalities.\n\n**W3 (Training trick)**. We disagree that the proposed method is a training trick. It is a different architecture whose training scheme is designed in a way that improves one of the limitation of current SOTA methods. \nMoreover, we have provided detailed empirical studies on four datasets and numerous settings of missing modalities, which establishes the general applicability of our approach towards handling missing modality. \n\n**W4 (Presentation of Fig. 2)**.  Fig. 2 shows the modality switching mechanism and each column in S-1, -2, and -3 represents a *batch* of size 5. More specifically, S-1) all batches are multimodal in all epochs, S-2) half of the batches in each epoch are multimodal and the other half are unimodal, S-3) each batch has a different randomly selected modality. More details are provided in Section 3.2.\n\n**W5 (Training stage)**.  It can handle missing modalities at the training stage.  We provided a comparison with a recently published paper  (Lee et al. , 2023) (Table below) on missing modalities during training.   \n\n|     Datasets    | Training |      | Testing |      |  Gazelle |  ViLT |  Lee et al. |\n|:---------------:|:--------:|:----:|:-------:|------|----------|-------|-------------|\n|                 | Image    | Text | Image   | Text |          |       |             |\n|   UPMC Food-101 |    100   |  100 |   100   |  100 |   **94.6**   |  91.9 |    92.0 |\n|                 |    100   |  30  |   100   |  30  |   **84.8**   |  66.3 |     74.5    |\n|                 |    30    |  100 |    30   |  100 |   80.0   |  76.7 |     **86.2**    |\n|   Hateful Memes |    100   |  100 |   100   |  100 |   **72.5**   |  70.2 |     71.0    |\n|                 |    100   |  30  |   100   |  30  |   **72.0**   |  60.8 |     59.1    |\n|                 | 30       |  100 |    30   |  100 |   58.8   |  61.6 |     **63.1**    |\n\nWe would like to clarify that we don't use fusion of any sort in our training. As explained in manuscript, only at test time, if complete modalities are present, late fusion is employed by taking an average of the logits obtained from the softmax layer over multiple modalities to compute classification score.\n\n**W6 (In-depth analysis)**.  We appreciate the suggestion.\nIt is not trivial to apply our approach directly on ViLT, as the architectures used in these methods require a complete set of modalities for training.  We do provide a comparison with Two-branch model, which is essentially a baseline of our approach without the proposed training scheme. As seen in Tables 7 and 8, our approach consistently demonstrates superior performances compared to Two-branch model on all settings.\nIn addition, following your suggestion, we carry out some experiments using emb. extracted from ViT (image modality) \\& Doc2Vec ( text modality) which makes our approach comparable with ViLT.
