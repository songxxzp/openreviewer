The paper introduces Landau Chamfer Distance, leveraging the Landau distribution to better weight short and long-distance pairs in the loss function. Experimental results reveal consistent improvements in point cloud completion quality when replacing traditional CD with Landau CD. This approach offers enhanced robustness to outliers, promising advancements in point cloud completion accuracy for applications like 3D object reconstruction and computer vision."

The paper's focus on improving the standard Chamfer Distance is highly relevant, as CD is a critical and widely used loss function for optimization point cloud completion models. Enhancing its performance is crucial for various applications in 3D object reconstruction and computer vision.\n\n2. The paper employs a rigorous evaluation methodology by exclusively replacing the loss function during training. This approach effectively isolates the effects of the proposed method, allowing for a clear assessment of its impact on point cloud completion. This meticulous testing strategy ensures the paper's contributions are thoroughly validated.\n\n3. The paper provides quantitative results that consistently showcase improvements in point cloud completion quality when utilizing the proposed Landau Chamfer Distance. These consistent findings reinforce the efficacy of the approach, suggesting its reliability and potential for practical use.\n\n4. The paper's evaluations encompass multiple models and datasets, demonstrating the versatility and adaptability of the proposed method. By testing on diverse scenarios, the paper underscores the generalizability of the Landau Chamfer Distance approach, making it applicable to a wide range of point cloud completion tasks and data sources.

                    "value": "Weaknesses Identified in the Paper:\n\n1. The paper suffers from poor clarity, especially in the method section. The writing should be simplified and clarified to ensure that the proposed approach and its rationale are more easily understood, even by people who are not very familiar with the topic.\n\n2. The initial sections of the introduction are structured more like the beginning of a related work section, and the introduction should primarily focus on why the proposed approach is necessary rather than reviewing the literature on point cloud completion. The paper's potential impact beyond point cloud completion should be emphasized in the introduction, making it a motivating \"funnel.\"\nMerging the first two sections of the introduction into the related work section would help streamline the paper and improve its flow.\n\n3. The method section requires improvement in its description. The challenges and motivation could be merged into the introduction. In the method section, the paper should first provide a high-level overview of the proposed approach before justifying each component's selection, such as the choice of grid search and the distance function.\n\n4. The analysis section and Figure 2 need enhancement. For example, the paper mentions that differences between the two components can easily be seen in Figure 2. This might be the case for people who are very familiar with the topic, but to me, the Figure did not clearly show any differences of particular significance. I suggest being more specific in making the arguments in the analysis part. This should include improvements to Figure 2, maybe by highlighting the most important differences.\n\n5. The language used in the paper can be imprecise. For instance, stating that a pattern across different epochs \"proves\" the validity of prioritizing long-distance pairs to reduce outliers is misleading; instead, the paper should clarify that it provides evidence in support of this idea.\n\n6. The qualitative results presented in Figure 4 appear to show marginal improvements at best. It would be beneficial to include more representative examples that clearly demonstrate the benefits of the proposed loss function qualitatively. Alternatively, the paper may use zoomed-in sections and highlighting, similar to Figure 5, to provide a more illustrative presentation of the results."

Chamfer Distance (CD) is widely used as a metric and training loss to measure the similarity between two point clouds. However, traditional CD has issues regarding sensitivity to outliers, allowing a few widely distributed points to excessively influence the final similarity score. Additionally, it calculates the average distances of matched point pairs without considering the underlying point-wise distance distribution or addressing differences in pair weights.\nIn response to these challenges, comprehensive analyses were conducted to prioritize short and long-distance pairs using Gaussian distributions obtained through grid search. Following these findings, an indirect approach identified the Landau distribution, among various distributions, as fitting the bimodal Gaussian mixture model, balancing two types of pairs. Based on these observations, LandauCD was introduced as a new loss function grounded in the Landau distribution.\nThrough extensive experiments involving LandauCD, significant and consistent improvements were observed across popular baseline networks trained with CD-based losses. These enhancements led to the achievement of new state-of-the-art performance levels on benchmark datasets such as PCN, Shapet-55/34, and ShapeNet-Part. Additionally, the consistent improvements from LandauCD were supported by theoretical explanations."

Specifically, the similarity of the distribution of the paired point should be considered in the point cloud metrics.

The proposed loss takes more consideration of larger distance values to prioritize the long-distance point pairs by using Landau distribution to approximate a re-weighting function. In a way, the proposed loss function can (1) dynamically re-distribute paired distance in the paired point sets; and (2) make use of both near and far points.

I wondered if some comparisons to this truncated CD loss could be presented to further validate the effect of prioritizing long-distance point pairs.\n\n- Is the searched Gaussian distribution general to different datasets? The authors could add experiments.\n\n- Figure 2 does not show a clear pattern of whether the large point distance is reduced when prioritizing the long-distance point pairs. \n\n- I wondered if some theoretical explanation on choosing Landau distribution to approximate the re-weighting function in eq.4 could be presented.\n\n- All these loss functions, including NeurIPS 2021 paper Density-aware CD, are tested on ModelNet, ShapeNet, etc. However, they lack practical use in the real world. I wondered if the authors could provide experiments on some real-world datasets.\n\n- Experimental validation of using two composed distributions over using one distribution (on near or far-distance point pairs) should be provided to further validate the effect of the proposed method.\n\n- As the paper proposed a general loss function, I wondered if some broader use of the loss function could be discussed in the paper."
