                    "value": "This work provides a re-interpretation of transformers as a probabilistic generative model of concepts and presents a new architecture, inductive transformers, that enables a stronger inductive bias towards more structured concepts. Tokens are encoded into latent variables with their own hierarchies/relations with other latent variables, and a decoder maps these latent variables back into tokens. Much machinery of the model is the same as vanilla transformers, but the operations are cleverly recast into this probabilistic framework, but there are also many additions are made to the model to accommodate this probabilistic framework. They trained their model on a toy dataset with two-token pairs and show that it can learn abstract concepts like modifiers (\"big cat\" or \"big dog\"), puts abstract concepts consistently in the same location within the model, and exhibits controlability in being able to delete concepts. This shows a potential improvement to transformers in terms of interpretability."

Most of the details needed to understand the model are hidden in the appendix. Its not at all clear how this model works without digging through the appendix, and even then it takes a long time to figure out how the different components come together. \n\n--> We have now completed a lot of edits to hopefully make the paper more accessible. We agree that it would have been nice to be able to include (a) a high-level figure for the production and statistical model without all of the factor graph details, (b) a comparison table with more space to explain the comparison of each layer type (c ) the factored probability distribution for vanilla and for inductive transformers.

We are right up against the limit.\n\nThe introduction, I feel, can be condensed a lot \n-->  We actually assembled a draft exactly like this, and to be honest it really did not seem to help.  Bringing in slivers of appendices into the main body seemed to be both too little additional explanation and also too much detail, both at the same time.  Even if we eliminated the introduction almost entirely, it would not afford enough space for all but a sliver of the appendices.  \n\nand the content in the supplement should be moved into the main paper such that readers of the main paper should understand how this architecture is implemented.\n\n--> We completely agree! The content in the supplement should be moved into the main paper. In an archival version where space allows, we will do that.  Unfortunately, ICLR severely limits the available space to a strict limit of 9 pages.  That said, we do feel that the reader who hopefully gains from the main body a high-level appreciation of the story, can open the appendices side by side with the main body and refer back and forth fairly efficiently.  In other words, all of the supporting material is, at the end of the day, contained in the submission. \n\n--> Since the initial submission, we have also done a tremendous amount of further editing on both the main body and the appendices  in order to try to make them more understandable and to tie it all together more seamlessly.\n\n\nThe model is only implemented on a very simple toy dataset (two word sentences). It would be better to see how this model can be used on a larger dataset that is more on the level of what transformers are trained on.\n\n--> Two thoughts here:\n\n(1) We agree that a key next step will be to scale this up! That said, we see it as future work. We intend this first paper to be analogous to theoretical physicists proposing a new mathematical model with simulations that show that the math works. Future work then typically involves a larger team of experimentalists. We have now joined with an experimental team to do just that, but we would humbly submit that this paper represents a publishable contribution in terms of new ideas, novel mathematical derivations, and code that implements the model and runs.\n\n(2) Scaling laws for large language models are critical for the field. That said, models scale up, but they do not scale down. There is a minimum data set size below which all previous transformer architectures do not learn anything. Ours does. We now state explicitly in the text that \"We design a transformer that successfully learns even as the data set size scales to zero.\"\n\n\nQuestions:\nA lot of components of the model seem highly similar to clone structured cognitive graphs (George et al. 2021). What are the similarities/differences to their work?\n\n--> My co-author read the work you suggested, and will provide an answer in an additional comment.\n\n\nThank you again for your feedback!"

Although it might make the paper more accessible to a specific sub-field with the particular vocabulary, many in deep learning are not familiar with probabilistic graphical models, belief propagation, graph grammars, etc.  We have been trying to restrict ourselves to only using simple probability theory and self-contained explanations.\n\nThe empirical results were unconvincing. The training set was too simplistic, and the simple lesion done does not confirm the hypothesis of structured / compositional knowledge.\n\n--> Three thoughts here:\n\n(1) We also agree that a key step will be to scale this up! We see that as future work. We intend this first paper to be analogous to theoretical physicists proposing a new mathematical model with simulations that show that the math works. Future work then typically involves a larger team of experimentalists. We have now joined with an experimental team to do just that, but we would humbly submit that this paper represents a publishable contribution in terms of new ideas, novel mathematical derivations, and code that implements the model and runs.\n\n(2) Scaling laws for large language models are critical for the field. That said, models scale up, but they do not scale down. There is a minimum data set size below which all previous transformer architectures do not learn anything. Ours does. We now state explicitly in the text that \"We design a transformer that successfully learns even as the data set size scales to zero.\"\n\n(3) This paper essentially shows how to efficiently learn a PCFG using belief propagation as inference and back-prop for learning.  For the first time PCFG structure learning does not require using inside-outside, E-M, and all that.  We do it with tensors in PyTorch.  The literature on grammar learning at smaller scales and less scalable algorithms, however, does demonstrate that learned PCFGs are structured and compositional, and we cite, for example, Goodman et. al. who have demonstrated machine learning of compositional and structural PCFGs to grade student programming assignments.  Space did not allow for a full treatment of grammar learning literature.   For the deep learning reader, we show the startling conclusion that the vanilla transformer actually IS a grammar learner.  Seen from that perspective, this work in some sense unifies PCFG learning and transformers into a single mathematical framework."

The key strength of the paper is the contribution of ... a model whose motivation is to achieve improved causal reasoning, iterative experimentation, long-range planning, and other cognitive abilities in language models, which are active research areas.\n\n--> We agree!  Many would also agree that without additional inductive bias, and with only the current scaling path for large language models with larger multimodal datasets and RLHF, it could be extremely expensive to achieve these capabilities, and may not be feasible.  We actually changed the discussion section to list the contributions of the paper: \n\n\"This paper offers the following contributions: (1) We provide the first demonstration of causal intervention in a transformer model. For example, we show how to delete specific concepts by deleting specific sub-networks. (2) We design a transformer that successfully learns even as the data set size scales to zero. (3) We design a transformer such that the concepts it learns are localized within\nidentifiable sub-networks. (4) We show that the feed-forward layers of a vanilla transformer learn underlying functions that can instead be derived analytically. (5) We derive from first principles why the multi-layer perceptrons in the feed-forward layer of the vanilla transformer are factored the way they are. (6) We show that the connectivity from the encoder to the decoder in the vanilla transformer is not correct and how to fix it.2 (8) We derive the testable prediction that training data with a particular inductive bias can help unlock a range of important new abilities for large language models, including curiosity. One could generate synthetic data from, for example, the model we described here, and use this synthetic data within the overall mix of training data for a foundation model (Aky \u0308urek et al., 2020). (9) We show that this inductive bias training data can be replaced or augmented by directly designing the inductive bias into the activation functions and connectivity of the model. (9) We mathematically define concepts, and explain why scaling up models yields greater\nconceptual abstraction. We suggest that deeper abstractions manifest as \u201cemergent\u201d capabilities.\"\n\nThe illustrative example is intuitive and helpful to get a sense of all the advantages of the inductive transformer elicited in the paper.\nThe definitions for key ideas like identifiability, controllability are clear, increasing the readability of the paper.\n--> Thank you!\n\n\n1. The paper lacks empirical evaluation with large-scale experiments and/or diverse datasets, which reduces its impact in my opinion. A more comprehensive evaluation would provide a clearer understanding of its capabilities and limitations.\n\n--> Two thoughts here:\n\nScaling laws for large language models are critical for the field.

It would be helpful to discuss the trade-offs between model performance and computational resources, as well as practical scalability issues that may arise.\n--> Inductive bias always reduces the size of the overall search space.  It can, however, make the search space more difficult to traverse which can be costly in compute.  That is not the case here.  As we show by reproducing the training run 100 times, the convergence is efficient and repeatable.  it does not, for example, get stuck in local minima.\n\nThe paper focuses on concept learning, but does not discuss in detail the interpretability and explainability of the inductive transformer. Understanding how this model forms concepts and making its decision-making processes more interpretable is important in assessing its utility.\n--> The majority of ML readers are not focused on interpretability, but we feel that for those who are, the implications are clear from considering the controllability and identifiability sections.  Concepts in this model are localized and can be deleted."
