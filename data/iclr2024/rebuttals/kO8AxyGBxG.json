While I think the author conveys the high-level idea of their approach clearly, the current manuscript seems to be missing many details and contains typos, errors, and inconsistencies in details.

Difference summary is needed, also the comparison with these algorithms.\n\n*[1] Graph Information Bottleneck for Subgraph Recognition, ICLR, 2021.*\n\n*[2] Graph Structure Learning with Variational Information Bottleneck, AAAI, 2022.*\n\n- The novelty of this work appears relatively limited, as it is considered incremental. Existing works already investigate graph robustness and interpretability from a information perspective. The primary novelty seems to lie in the consideration of fairness (unified framework). However, the integration of robustness, interpretability, and fairness into a unified framework could be achieved through a simple combination of existing approaches. Results (Table 2, Table 3) show that the proposed model is lower than GSAT in terms of interpretability and robustness, and lower than Graphair in terms of fairness. It raises the question of whether designing a model that directly combines the strengths of GSAT and Graphair would outperform the UNITE.\n\n- It is advisable to offer a more comprehensive description of the experimental settings. This should encompass critical elements, including hyperparameters, learning rates, batchsize, machines, etc. Furthermore, the inclusion of parameter sensitivity experiments and the sharing of code and hyperparameters would greatly bolster the study's reproducibility and overall scientific rigor.\n\n- Please cite GCN and GIN (Section 5.1, Baseline).\n\n- Writing typos, e.g., \"Appendix ??\" (one line above Eq.13)."

It is necessary to provide practical definitions for the variables $g$ and $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\n- Eq. 25 lacks a reference, and it is advisable to include one for clarity and credibility.\n\n- Since the results are very similar to the baselines, have significance tests been conducted to assess the statistical significance of the findings?\n\n- In Section 5.2.1, the explanation for why GSAT performs better is explained as its strong capability to filter task-irrelevant information through stochastic attention. Does this mean stochastic attention is more effective in filtering task-irrelevant information (enhancing GNN explainability) than IB theory?"

For instance, the edges that cause biases may not necessarily be those causing adversarial vulnerability. Due to the lack of in-depth discussion, the solution is also pretty isolated (e.g., one loss term for one facet).\n\n2. The proposed method has limited technical novelty and contribution. Though the authors try to explain from the information theory perspective, the ultimate solution is still a combination of existing treatments for each facet.

The paper over-claims robustness as adversarial perturbations in many places, however, neither the design nor the experiment really deal with adversarial attacks, which could be misleading. Can the authors draw a clear boundary when discussing robustness?\n\n2. When dealing with robustness, the authors establish the mutual information relationship based on a Markov chain, which is not justified. If it is an assumption, why is it reasonable? If it is an observation, is there any evidence to support this observation? The authors should make it clear where this Markov chain comes from. Meanwhile, it is not explained why such a chain will lead to the mutual information relationship.\n\n3. When dealing with fairness, usually mutual information concerns two distributions, then what does it mean by $I(G_s; Y; S)$? How is Eq. (5) used (as later content does not really use $g$ again)? \n\n4. What is the evaluation protocol? The method eventually obtains a $G_s$ generator $P_\\phi(G_s|G)$. After obtaining this generator, how is it evaluated to report the metrics in experiment (e.g., using it to process every graph and training a GNN etc)?\n\n5. There is NO related work section. Trustworthy GNN is a broad and active research area, and the authors should provide a comprehensive discussion on them and how this work differentiates them.\n\n6. Given that there are multiple existing works in GNN robustness [1] and fairness [2], why is UNITE only compared with the selected ones?\n\n7. The sparsity definition is misleading. It should be as $1- \\frac{|G_s|}{G}$, and higher sparsity indicates more compressed interpretation.\n\n[1] Zhang, Xiang, and Marinka Zitnik. \"Gnnguard: Defending graph neural networks against adversarial attacks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 33 (2020): 9263-9275.\n\n[2] Wang, Nan, et al. \"Unbiased graph embedding with biased graph observations.\" Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2022."

To establish a holistic and all-encompassing approach to trustworthy GNNs, this paper introduces UNITE, an innovative end-to-end framework meticulously crafted to seamlessly unite these three fundamental dimensions. Extensive experimentation conducted on real-world datasets reveals that UNITE surpasses the capabilities of current methodologies, effectively attaining a harmonious fusion of interpretability, resilience, and equity. This breakthrough represents a pivotal step toward realizing the full potential of trustworthy GNNs, providing a comprehensive solution to address the multifaceted challenges in this field."
