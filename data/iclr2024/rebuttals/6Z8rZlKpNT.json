                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. **More baselines are needed for comparison.** This method does not belong to either generative or discriminative OOD detection. It uses the activation of the discriminative model to perform generative modeling to get the density. It is somewhere between the two branches of research lines. Thus, I think the model needs to be compared to many other discriminative OOD detection baselines [1,2]. Also, some recent generative OOD detection methods [3,4] need to be compared. At least the authors should discuss the recent approaches in the literature review. \n\n>[1] RankFeat: Rank-1 Feature Removal for Out-of-distribution Detection. NeurIPS 2022.\n>\n>[2] Extremely Simple Activation Shaping for Out-of-Distribution Detection. ICLR 2023.\n>\n>[3] The Tiled Variational Autoencoders: Improving Out-of-distribution Detection. ICLR 2023.\n>\n>[4] Harnessing Out-of-distribution Examples via Augmenting Content and Styles. ICLR 2023.\n\n\n2. **Missing Details of the CNF of ResNet activations.** The method section is quite unclear to me. The author simply wrote \"_learning an invertible mapping between the latent space and a Gaussian probability distribution._\" What is the mean and variance of the target Gaussian distribution? How is the model trained? Did you freeze the weight of the main classification branch? Did you still enforce the cross-entropy between class predictions and the ground truth? How do you match the transformed distributions to Gaussian marginals? There are too many important implementation details missing.  After all, it is quite weird that the core method part is quite short and unclear -- even shorter than the introduction of NF and BPD measures. \n \n3. **More OOD datasets are needed for the CIFAR10 benchmark.** Conventionally, OOD detection papers evaluated on CIFAR10 take 6 or 5 OOD datasets, including LSUN-crop, LSUN-resize, iSUN, Places365, and SVHN. However, this paper only chooses SVHN, which does not really capture diverse OOD scenarios and makes the actual average performance across datasets questionable.\n\n4. **Paper Structure.** The paper is poorly written and not organized well. The authors spend 2 pages on related work but use half a page for the method. Actually, some paragraphs in related work are unnecessary, especially the normalizing flow part. Moreover, some subsection in the discussion needs prior knowledge in the method section, such as Sec. 6.3 and 6.2. You need to first tell the audience you perform normalization in the method, and then it makes more sense to discuss why normalization is necessary."

They do briefly discuss density estimation in the latent space (Sec 8), but their analysis is extremely limited and their results are not strong (Table 2), underperforming other benchmarks we compare to (for example, they report 73.31% AUROC for CIFAR-10 vs SVHN, which all of our tested baselines exceed by at least 13.8%). Our work carries this investigation much further. We have amended our submission to better credit the important contribution of Kirichenko et al.\u2019s prior work, while clarifying our contributions. Our findings that flow models can provide strong post-hoc OOD detection performance on large datasets with latent normalization and undertraining is novel, and we hope these techniques will be a valuable tool for the community."

We appreciate that you highlighted a key strength of our paper: it is a post-hoc method and is intended to be applied to pretrained classifier models. \n\n> Exploiting the latent space of deep generative models has many existing works, but this paper lacks a discussion and comparison of them [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. \n\nWe note that our explanation of our core contributions was perhaps misunderstood. We investigate density estimation in the latent space of a pretrained classifier model, not the latent space of a generative VAE or flow model. The literature listed does not overlap with our main approach: they do not touch on density estimation in the latent spaces of pretrained classifier models, and are not post-hoc methods, but require training of a VAE or flow on pixel data. Because of this training requirement, it may not be trivial to extend the VAE approaches to larger, more complex datasets like full resolution ImageNet. We believe working with pretrained classifier latents remains an important advantage of our method.\n\nOur findings that flow models can provide strong post-hoc OOD detection performance on large datasets with latent normalization and undertraining is novel, and we hope these techniques will be a valuable tool for the community."

Samples can then be classified as OOD in standard fashion, i.e. if their (latent) representations are evaluated to be of low likelihood under the flow model (are smaller than a threshold value). Quantitative evaluation of the proposed strategy is reported and involves measuring AUROC under six standard datasets used as OOD test scenarios, in comparison with alternative OOD detection methods. Examples of favourable performance are reported."

                    "value": "As discussed OOD detection is a worthy topic of study, however the current version of the submission raises several key concerns. Namely questions remain over lack of sufficient novelty and contradictions within the crux of the message, in important parts. \n\nCrucially, previous work has already evidenced that 'flows are much better at OOD detection on image embeddings than on the original image datasets'; see Sec. 8, [a]. Somewhat confusingly, the current submission (also) cites [a] when claiming that 'normalizing flows are not effective for OOD detection in this domain'. Authors may wish to comment on this apparent contradiction. \n\nThe submission reports upon an experimental search for better performance down various well-trodden paths (e.g. PCA, early stopping, normalisation), however details of innovation are unclear.\n\nSome terminology issues and sloppy writing may serve to distract the reader. Suggest to tighten the exposition and take more care to keep the readership invested. As example:\n\n* Sec 2.3 states both that:\n'Normalizing flows [...] have historically performed very poorly for OOD detection in image classification'\nand also:\n'Zhang et al. demonstrate strong OOD detection performance using normalizing flows in image classification'\n\n* Highlighting problems such as 'few theoretical guarantees' exist and then proceeding with an empirical study leads to confusion. Suggest that authors are instead more focused, in terms of how they prime their readership, for their contributions.\n\n* The abstract claims to present a method 'avoiding researcher bias in OOD sample selection' yet Sec. 6.2 strongly recommends that practitioners 'evaluate [...] on both the original validation and a representative OOD dataset'. Authors may want to extend the latter point by qualifying the aforementioned bias-related issue.\n\nFinally, experimental work can be considered somewhat insufficient. This could be made stronger by considering wider comparisons with additional recent work. There is a large and growing body of OOD work that the authors may wish to also acknowledge and consider (non-exhaustive eg. [b,c,d]).\n\n\nSummary: \n\n* Concern over the novelty of the hypothesis, insights and sufficiency of both the technical contributions, experimental investigation.\n\n* Contradictory sentiments and statements make it, on occasion, difficult to follow the logical argument and message. Unfortunately the composition of the paper is in a premature state. \n\n\n Minor:\n\n* Some figures (e.g. Figure 1, Figure 2) are not referenced in the main body text. \n* Tab. 4: typos exist.\n\nReferences:\n\na.

Our findings that latent normalization and flow undertraining substantially improve OOD detection is a novel contribution, and we hope the community benefits from these findings. For example, Jiang et al. 2020 applies PCA to reduce their embeddings to 10D for rare example mining; our results show that an unreduced latent space may improve their performance.\n\n> Sec 2.3 states both that: 'Normalizing flows [...] have historically performed very poorly for OOD detection in image classification' and also: 'Zhang et al. demonstrate strong OOD detection performance using normalizing flows in image classification' \n> The abstract claims to present a method 'avoiding researcher bias in OOD sample selection' yet Sec. 6.2 strongly recommends that practitioners 'evaluate [...] on both the original validation and a representative OOD dataset'.\n\nThank you for the suggestions to improve the presentation of contributions in our work. We have clarified that Zhang et al. is not a post-hoc method and has strong but limited results. We have additionally clarified that all our results are produced with exactly one epoch of flow training to ensure consistent evaluations across models and datasets. We have removed the discussion of guiding early stopping using a representative OOD dataset, as although this technique can further improve OOD performance for a specific OOD set, this distracts from the ability to operate without such OOD sample guidance.\n\nRegarding additional recent works in OOD detection: we have expanded our related works section, added ODIN as a comparison method, and added additional datasets for comparison against CIFAR-10.\n\n> It has been noted that, in performing OOD detection, the inductive biases of normalizing flows can cause difficulty for image space learning. One interesting question going forward, might be to look at how such biases interact with the noted differences in latent distributions that arise from supervised, unsupervised backbones models (Sec 6.5).\nSince flows tend to learn representations that achieve high likelihood through local pixel correlations in the image space, rather than discovering semantic structure, can analogous observations be drawn about differences in the 'shapes' of (un)supervised latent spaces?\n\nWe appreciate your curiosity into the results of section 6.5: the connection between the structure and shape of ID data and OOD data in latent space and the performance of our method for OOD detection is also intriguing to us but remains an area of active research. We look forward to expanding on the investigation and results of section 6.5 in future work beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nThank you for your detailed and focused feedback, we hope our amendments address your concerns."

                        "value": "Thank you for your detailed review, we appreciate your feedback and are glad you enjoyed our in-depth discussion.\n> The core method of modeling flows in the latent space lacks novelty: [Kirichenko et al., 2020], which the authors cite, explicitly mentions that while flows on the input-space don't perform well, latent-space flows perform much better.\n\nThank you for highlighting this. Kirichenko et al. 2020 does briefly discuss density estimation in the latent space (Sec 8), but their analysis is extremely limited and their results do not exceed other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy. Our work carries this investigation much further and demonstrates compelling results that do present NF-based OOD detection as a competitive method. We have amended our work to clarify and credit their prior discussion of this point.\n\n> The authors claim a benefit of their method does not require OOD data. However, in the discussion section, the authors state that representative OOD data is useful to determine when to stop flow training. If early stopping is necessary for good flow performance, the authors should detail how they chose when to stop training in the models used to evaluate the results.\n\nWe acknowledge that referring to this as early-stopping was misleading. We have updated our wording to clarify the fixed short-duration training approach and have removed reference to using representative OOD data to determine when to stop flow training. All of our results were produced by training the normalizing flow for exactly one epoch as a matter of convention, as this was found to produce consistently strong results across multiple backbone models and datasets.  \n\n> The experimental evaluation is limited:\n\nWe have updated results to include ODIN, although additional methods will not outperform the existing best baseline, ReAct, on most evaluations. We have also added additional datasets for evaluation against CIFAR-10. Reporting error bars on AUROC is possible but not widespread in the literature, as output variation is both limited and fairly consistent across methods. We are actively researching the connection between OOD detection and compactness of latent representations (as discussed in sec 6.5) but further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n> *Questions:* The discussion section of the paper is frank about the practical challenges in getting flow models to work well for OOD detection, and that, in particular, there are considerations on early stopping during training. How did the authors choose when to stop training for the flow models whose OOD detection results are shown in Tables 1 and 2?\n\nAs highlighted in section 6.2, peak OOD detection performance is a function of flow training time that is dependent on the dataset and backbone model. To ensure our method is generally applicable and to avoid reliance on OOD data, all of our results are generated by training the flow model for only one epoch on the training dataset. This produces consistently strong, although not always optimal, results across several backbone models and datasets."
