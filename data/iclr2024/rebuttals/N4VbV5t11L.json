Since feature selection is a very classical task in machine learning, there are a lot of feature selection methods proposed every year. However, most of the compared methods are proposed about 10 years ago, which cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper should compare with plenty of most recently state-of-the-art methods.\n3. It is simple to give an example to show that use the k leading eigenvectors is suboptimal. But could you provide some more theoretical analysis about the selected k eigenvectors of the proposed method?"

Once \"relevant\" eigenvectors are selected, their binarized versions are used to obtain a feature relevance score for feature selection, again using independent surrogate models. The method is shown to select relevant eigenvectors that may not be among the top choices from the eigendecomposition, which occurs in particular when outliers or structured noise is present in the data."

This could be more clearly stated in the introduction by contrasting what is being proposed here (at a high level) with the approaches from the literature. \n\nThe proposed approach can be judged as ad-hoc; it is not clear when is it necessary to search eigenvectors beyond the top choices.\n\nThe flexibility of the proposed approach leaves some questions that are not fully addressed, such as how to select proxy models to use in each one of the two steps where they are involved.\n\nMinor comments:\n\nIn Section 2.1 ISOMPAS should be ISOMAP.\nAlgorithm 1 line 1: should \"pseudo pseudo-labels\" be \"pseudo-labels\"?

The flow from introduction to experimental results is seamless, making the reading experience smooth.\n    - The inclusion of visual aids and intuitive examples, like the aforementioned synthetic data example, greatly augments the paper's clarity.\n\n---\n\nOverall, this paper presents a commendable blend of original ideas and rigorous empirical evaluation. It aptly showcases the potential of spectral methods in the domain of feature selection, thereby enriching the repertoire of techniques available to the research community."

                    "value": "1. **Absence of Theoretical Justification:** The paper lacks rigorous theoretical analysis supporting its central claim, specifically that \"certain features might not significantly affect supervised learning, they can heavily impact unsupervised tasks.\" In the absence of a theoretical framework, the claim rests primarily on empirical observations. To further the contribution, the authors should delve into a theoretical discussion, offering insights into why and under what conditions their claim holds.\n\n2. **Ambiguity in Real-World Data Analysis:** While the paper demonstrates superior performance against other models by potentially extracting lower-ranked but more informative features, it does not provide direct evidence of this assertion in its real-world-data experiments. A more thorough investigation or a controlled experiment showing how these \"lower-ranked but more useful features\" contribute to better performance would substantially strengthen the paper's claims.\n\n3. **Inconsistencies in Benchmark Results:** The discrepancies between the accuracies reported in this paper and those in prior works like \"Nonnegative Discriminative Feature Selection (NDFS),\" specifically for datasets like GISETTE, raise concerns about the reproducibility and fairness of the comparisons. The significant difference in accuracy (66.4% in this paper vs. 74.4% in the NDFS paper) cannot be dismissed as a minor discrepancy. It's crucial to clarify if the datasets used in both papers were identical, if any pre-processing steps differed, or if there were variations in experimental settings. The authors must either provide an explicit justification for these discrepancies or conduct their experiments under the same conditions as prior works to ensure a fair comparison."

Under what specific conditions or scenarios can these lower-ranked features outperform the higher-ranked ones? Is it possible to encapsulate this observation in a more formal manner, perhaps through a specific theorem or lemma that sheds light on this phenomenon?\n\n2. **Discrepancies in Experimental Results:** I noticed that there are some discrepancies in the reported results for certain models, such as NDFS on the GISETTE dataset, when compared to their original publications. Can you provide insights into why such discrepancies arise even when the same model is evaluated on the same dataset? Were there any differences in the experimental setups, data preprocessing steps, or other factors that might have influenced these results?"

                    "value": "The paper proposes a new method for unsupervised feature selection, which is evaluated with the down-stream task of clustering.\nLike similar previous methods, the proposed algorithm gives a score to each feature, based on a synthetic (self-supervised) labeling task.\nThe novelty is in the selection of the labels, and the model that is used for solving the self-supervised task. In contrast to previous methods, the authors find eigenvectors of the graph laplacian which are robust to resampling, and create pseudo-labels that are robust to outliers in the data.\nThe evaluation is done using a set of 8 datasets, and for each dataset and method combination, growing subsets of features from size 2 to 300 are extracted, and clusters repeatedly with K-Means, assuming the true number of labels is known, and evaluated using cluster accuracy.\nThe authors show that their methods performs competitively with other methods for unsupervised feature selection."

                    "value": "I have several concerns about the evaluation method. The paper claim to follow Cai et. al, but to me there seem to be important differences between their methodology and the reference, though their method seems closer to Li 2012, which I also think uses somewhat questionable evaluation metrics.\n\nEvaluating unsupervised methods is quite difficult, and the paper makes a good effort for a fair and thorough evaluation, but parts of the method are unclear and other parts seem questionably.\nIn particular, I would prefer the use of adjusted rand index or possibly normalized mutual information instead of clustering accuracy, as more standard metrics.\nSecond, because of the randomness involved in many aspects of the algorithm, I would appreciate it if there were repetitions of the results, and standard deviations reported. Using the maximum performance over several different numbers of features increases the potential variability of results.\nI did a simple experiment to understand the nature of the numbers, on the TOX-171 dataset. Randomly sampling an ordering of features, I used the same evaluation methodology used in the paper, and obtained results between an accuracy of 40% and 48% depending on the run. This means that completely random selection is likely indistinguishable from half of the methods considered on this dataset (though the proposed method is performing much better). \nIf the algorithms are re-run for each number of features, which is not clear to me from the paper, the baseline would be picking a new random order for each of the number of features. This produces relatively robustly a score of 45% on this dataset, beating two of the competing algorithms.\nI'm uncertain whether the protocol of picking the maximum over different numbers of features is a good practice, but given that, the paper should make clear if the algorithm is re-run for each number of features, or if the order of features is fixed.\nAlso, the paper should ideally include the scores of a random baseline, and an oracle result, i.e. what is the best possible result that can be achieved (say using the real labels as pseudo labels - another more expensive and potentially better scoring oracle would be to go over all subsets and run k-Means but that would be prohibitive). Interestingly, SSFS is close to the oracle performance on TOX-171 based on my analysis, which is quite impressive and somewhat surprising to me.\n\nFinally, the paper does not seem to explain the selection of the kernel hyper-parameters. This is quite critical, in particular the gamma parameter when using the rbf kernel. It's not clear to me what practice I would propose for that, but whatever methods was used should be described in the paper.\n\nminor points:\nIn the second paragraph of the introduction, \"lack of labels\" should probably be \"absence of labels\".\nI think section 3.1 could be shortened since the notation is not used afterwards, and in essence you are stating that in a disconnected graph, the eigenvectors to eigenvalue 0 of the laplacian are indicator functions of the connected components."
