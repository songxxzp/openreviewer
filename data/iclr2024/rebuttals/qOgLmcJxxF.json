It is demonstrated that using the $1-\\delta$ error, efficient training can be achieved with a sample complexity of poly($log (m^2/\\gamma)$) when employing score matching.This new measure proves sufficient for enabling efficient sampling through reverse SDE."

It recognizes the challenge of balancing score estimation accuracy with the number of required samples, providing insights into how to achieve efficient training.\n\n3.

                    "value": "I believe the presentation of this paper can be improved and there are several typos:\n1. After equation (1) on page 1, it writes 'for Brownian motion $dB_t$', while $dB_t$ is NOT the Brownian motion (actually $B_t$ is);\n2. On page 1, it writes $x_t\\sim e^{-t} x_0 + N(0, \\sigma_t^2), which seems like $x_t$ is restricted in $\\mathbb{R}$, but after equation (2) it looks like $x_t$ is a process in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ before $d$ is even defined;\n3. Also on page 1, it writes 'logarithmic in $m_2/\\epsilon$', where neither $m_2$ or $\\epsilon$ is defined before. Actually $m_2$ is defined in Theorem 1.2 for the first time;\n4. Equation (4) seems to refer to the minimizer, then it should be 'argmin ...' instead of 'min ...';\n5. Before equation (5), I can understand what you mean by 'with norm bounded by R', but I think it's not a commonly used expression. Maybe you can try something like 'supported in B(0,R)' instead?\n6. Before equation (6), we see $m_2$ again, still undefined;\n7. After equation (6), 'to satisfy' should be 'to be satisfied' instead;\n8. In Lemma 4.1, the parameter $\\eta$ depends on $m$, while $m$ is defined in the proof;\n9. In Lemma 4.1, I guess $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}$ means the empirical expectation, but it is not defined in the paper.\n10. In Theorem A.1, the notation of $s_r$, $s^*_r$, $\\hat{s}_r$ and $\\tilde{s}_r$ is a bit messy.\n11. A typo! The title of Appendix D should be 'Utility Results' instead of 'Utility Resuts' I think."

Where does this poly($log \\frac{m_2}{\\gamma}$) come from?\n2. In the remark after Corollary 1.1, it states that 'Corollary 1.1 doesn\u2019t depend on the domain size at all'. But H contains sufficiently accurate approximations to each score. Does it mean that $|H|$ should be related to the domain size?\n3. How is the discussion in section 4 related to that in Appendix D of [1]?\n4. On page 5, it states that 'If x is bounded by some value $R$, then the score would be bounded by $R/\\sigma^2$. Can you prove it or provide a reference? \n5. In Theorem A.1, what does it mean by 'r-smoothed version'?\n6. In Theorem A.1, are $\\hat{s}_r$ and $\\tilde{s}_r$ different? It seems that in the proof you assume they are equal (but actually they are not I think).\n\n[1] Holden Lee, Jianfeng Lu, and Yixin Tan.

As you suggested, we have uploaded a revised manuscript with a clearer presentation.\nIn particular, we appreciate and have addressed your corrections and suggestions such as defining $m_2$ before using it, and correcting several typos.\n\n**Explanation of $\\text{poly}(\\log(m_2/\\gamma))$:** This is motivated by the discussion in the previous section, where we note that prior works improve a $\\text{poly}(m_2/\\gamma)$ to a $\\text{poly}(\\log(m_2/\\gamma))$ for *sampling*. The natural question is to see if this improvement is possible in *training*, which is what we investigate.\n\n**Domain size:**\nYou make a fair point, $\\mathcal{H}$ doesn't necessarily depend on the domain size but it typically will.  For neural networks, for example, this induces a logarithmic dependence on the domain size. (See Theorem 1.5).\n\n\n**Appendix D of Lee et al:** The two examples are essentially the opposite of each other. They give an example of distributions with small $L^2$ error and large TV error; we give distributions with large $L^2$ error and small TV error. \nThey show non-annealed Langevin dynamics fails even with small $L^2$ error; we show annealed Langevin dynamics succeeds even for large $L^2$ error.\n\nNote also that the conclusion of Lee et al explicitly asks the question we address in this work:\n\n> The assumption that we have a score estimate that is\n$O(1)$-accurate in $L^2$, although weaker than the usual assumptions for theoretical analysis, is in fact still a\nstrong condition in practice that seems unlikely to be satisfied (and difficult to check) when learning complex\ndistributions such as distributions of images. What would a reasonable weaker condition be, and in what\nsense can we still obtain reasonable samples?\n\nOur distance measure $D_p^\\delta$ is a weaker condition than $L^2$ that is easier to learn in but still yields reasonable samples.\n\n**Bound on score:**\nThis is implied by Tweedie's formula: $s(x) = \\mathbb{E}_{z|x}[-z/\\sigma^2]$, and the numerator is $O(R)$.\n\n**Difference between $\\hat{s}$ and $\\tilde{s}$:** $\\tilde{s}$ refers to some candidate score function in $\\mathcal{H}$ that we are trying to analyze the loss function evaluated for, while $\\hat{s}$ is the empirical loss minimizer among these."

Then we only evaluate the score p_T near 0 rather than p_0. Since the p_T is highly smoothed, and the importance can also be reflected by the number of samples, the score is generally well-estimated in L2 sense. Otherwise the mixing of the algorithm is incorrect. In [1], it is shown that the score-based algorithm has a good mixing property. From this view, the proposed metric looks a bug, not feature?\nCan you explain this?\n\nI understand the challenges and hardness of learning L2, but there are still more examples needed to justify the new metric."

The authors focus on the sample complexity, i.e., the number of samples needed to reach a given accuracy measured e.g. in TV or Wasserstein-2 distance. The key result is an improvement from ${\\rm poly}(R/\\gamma)$ to ${\\rm poly}\\log(m_2/\\gamma)$ samples, where $R$ is the bound on the norm of the distribution, $\\gamma$ the required accuracy in Wasserstein-2 distance, and $m_2$ the second moment. The scaling with respect to the other parameters (input dimension, 1/accuracy in TV distance) remains polynomial.\n\nThe idea is to consider a less restrictive measure for the estimation of the score: instead of the L2 norm, the authors propose a form of quantile error in which regions with low probability are not considered. In fact, they authors show that the estimation of the score in L2 requires polynomially many samples in $1/\\gamma$ via an explicit example."

Recent papers analysing diffusion models (see e.g. Table 1 in \"Linear convergence bounds for diffusion models via stochastic localization\") show that this dependency is linear or quadratic in $d$. I appreciate that the setting of this paper is different (most works assume access to a good L2 score, which is shown to be impossible if one sticks with a logarithmic dependency in $1/\\gamma$). Nonetheless, the authors should track how the bound scales in $d$ and compare to existing work.\n\n* It would also add value to the paper to track the dependency on something more explicit than the cardinality of the hypothesis class $|\\mathcal H|$.

                        "value": "Thank you for your review. Below we have addressed the issues that you brought up, and hope that this helps clarify and explain the theory.\n\n**Scope:** \"While the improvement in terms of accuracy in Wasserstein distance is remarkable, the dependency on the accuracy in TV remains polynomial.\"\n\nLearning a distribution within TV error $\\varepsilon$ requires $1 / \\varepsilon^2$ samples information theoretically, so we cannot hope for going beyond polynomial for the dependency on the accuracy in TV. \n\n\"What's the point of improving drastically the accuracy in W2, if the accuracy in TV remains bad?\"\n\nThe W2 and TV error are incommensurate.  The W2 error is \"how blurry is the result\", while the TV error is \"what fraction of the distribution are completely missed\".  These are on different scales; if you want very sharp images, you want low W2 error, and we show that this can be achieved.\n\n**The authors should track how the bound scales in d and compare to existing work.**\nThe new version presents this.  For *sampling*, our bound is identical to the best existing analysis of the SDE (so, $O(d)$).  For *training*, estimating a single score (Theorem 1.1) takes sample complexity linear in $d$; estimating all the scores gives a $d^2$ dependence for Corollary 1.3.  For comparison, using the Block et al. bound would need $d^3$ for Corollary 1.3.  [They give a bound in terms of the Lipschitzness, which can be $\\Theta(d)$ in the regime they consider.]\n\n**It would also add value to the paper to track the dependency on something more explicit than the cardinality of the hypothesis class $\\mathcal{H}$.**.\n\nWhat would you propose?  The cardinality is pretty explicit, and leads to good bounds for neural networks (see Theorem 1.5).  One might try the Rademacher complexity of $\\mathcal{H}$, but this doesn't work well: the Rademacher complexity scales with the magnitude of the outputs, which (e.g. in the neural network example) is large and will yield a $\\text{poly}(1/\\gamma)$ dependence.\n\n**Along the same lines, for the result on neural networks (Theorem 3.1), one needs to assume the existence of a network that approximates the score well enough.**\n\nHow could it be otherwise?  If you can't represent the score, you aren't going to sample well with score-based diffusion.\n\n**Proof novelty:** \nThe idea of the proof is not actually to exclude a region of low probability.  The Block et al analysis shows for each possible score function $s$ that the score matching objective approximates its $L^2$ error, with enough samples.  The problem is that getting this many samples *requires* $\\text{poly}(\\frac{1}{\\gamma})$ samples, because for some score functions $s$ the value in the score matching objective has very large variance.\n\nThe idea in our proof is to essentially argue that those score functions are *very* bad, so it's OK to have a poor approximation to just how bad they are.  We show that the *difference* between the score matching objective for the optimal $s^*$ and any candidate $s$ has variance related to its expectation, such that every sufficiently-far $s$ will be rejected with high probability.\n\nThe proof involving excluding regions of low probability is just to bridge the gap between existing theory and our new proposed error metric, which we justify the use of in section 4.  Proving convergence in our new error metric is the main contribution."

What is the relation between the last sentence on page 3 and Theorem 1.2? Theorem 1.2 seems to be independent of training, why can we see from this theorem that our outlier-robust approximation suffices for sampling? \n5. Maybe the authors can comment a little bit on the polynomial dependency? Like what is the order of the polynomial. Block et al 2020 has an explicit polynomial dependency, and it is not clear if the results presented here is indeed better if the form of polynomial is not presented. \n6.

We would like to first clarify that our main contribution is not so much about unbounded distributions, as about higher *accuracy*:  to get accuracy $\\gamma m_2$ in Wasserstein, our approach proves a $\\text{poly}(\\log \\frac{1}{\\gamma})$ sample complexity while prior work needed $\\text{poly}(\\frac{1}{\\gamma})$.  And getting this improved dependence *requires* switching from $L^2$ approximation to a different measure.\n\n\n\nAddressing weaknesses (1, 2): We have rewritten the paper significantly, and included the formal theorem statements in the introduction.\n\nAddressing weakness (3):  First of all, our bound for finite $\\mathcal{H}$ is strong enough to extend to continuous neural networks as a corollary by essentially rounding the weights to finite precision (see Theorem 1.5).  So \" finite\" vs \"continuous\" is not what makes the result challenging.\n\nGenerally speaking, convergence of the empirical mean of a distribution depends on the variance of that distribution.  The score matching objective involves terms involving the norm of the output of a neural network; for the wrong-weight networks, this norm can be *huge*, making the convergence very slow; and to get accuracy $\\gamma$, such an approach gives a $\\text{poly}(\\frac{1}{\\gamma})$ rather than  the $\\text{poly}(\\log \\frac{1}{\\gamma})$ that we are able to achieve. \n\nAnswering specific questions:\n\n1, 2, 3. Thank you, we have rewritten the introduction more clearly.\n\n4. Again, we have written this more clearly; sampling requires sufficiently accurate scores, which Theorem 1.1 provides.\n\n5.  We now include the dependence. It is linear in $d$ and the complexity class $\\log \\mathcal{H}$. For neural networks (Theorem 1.5), the dependency is linear in $d$, the number of parameters $P$, and the neural network depth $D$."
