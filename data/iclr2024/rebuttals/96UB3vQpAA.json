                    "value": "The authors make the intriguing hypothesis that inhibitory neurons in neocortical networks can be partitioned into two groups, parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (fastspiking) whose synaptic strengths are strong and fixed and responsible for excitation-inhibition balance in the cortical network, and somatostatin-expressing interneorons whose synaptic strengths are weak and can be tuned to learn particular tasks. In essence, maintaining E_I balance is delegated to one set of inhibitory neurons and learning with weak synapses to the other.\n\nThey then build a 7 layer network with all to all recurrent connections in each layer and feedforward input from the previous layer. They test this network on learning MNIST and MNIST-fashion data and report results."

                    "value": "The major weakness of the paper is that all results are anecdotal. They build a particular 7 layer network as described above and simply report what they see when they try to train and/or change the strength of the weak synapses from the ST population of interneurons. There is no theoretical analysis of why they see what they report. Nor have they tried to play with the network architecture to really test and try to break their own hypothesis. One immediate suggestion would be to have both populations of inhibitory neurons have a wide range of synaptic strengths, and only have the weak synapses be trainable. This clearly goes against their hypothesis that the partition of the inhibitory neurons match the strength of their synapses. Finally, why 7 layers, not 6 or 8, or any smaller number for that matter?"

                    "value": "This paper introduces a new approach to training spiking neural networks by keeping (pre-designated) strong weights fixed while only training the weak weights. The authors motivate this biologically by drawing comparisons to the somewhat analogous inhibitory dynamics of PV and SST cells. As the strong weights maintain EI balance in every layer, the authors claim that it effectively acts like a batch normalization procedure, thereby improving learning. Furthermore, as strong weights dominate output layer gradients in the early stages of training, the initial improvements observed are largely due to the adjustment of the output weights (lazy regime). Eventually the trainable weak weights play a bigger role in improving performance and training switches to a rich regime."

                    "value": "I have one major concern (point 1) and several minor ones (points 2-5). \n\n1. There is a lack of experiments and investigations in this paper. To the best of my understanding, in the main paper, a total of 8 (4 architectures x 2 datasets) very small networks were trained once each on MNIST or FashionMNIST-- no repeated trials to account for random seeding. All 8 networks have the same size and same number of layers. Figures 1 and 2 introduce the model, while every plot in Figures 3, 4 and 5 all come from the (single) training of the aforementioned 8 networks. There is some mention of grid searching in the last page of the supplementary, but ultimately this simply results in the strong synapses taking (a single set of) predetermined fixed values. There should minimally be some basic investigations for completeness and rigor, such as:\n- experiments involving varied initializations\n- experiments related to robustness against hyperparameter tuning and other factors such as learning rate (see point 2), number of layers, number of neurons (see point 4)\n- experiments that investigate dynamical stability (beyond just KL from initial layer, such as steady-state behaviors)\nor else the results could potentially be an artifact of lucky initialization or even simply from that specific set of pre-determined large weights.  \nFor a paper investigating learning dynamics that uses a simple dataset like MNIST as an objective to identify interpretable learning artifacts (rich vs lazy), more rigorous experiments should be done. This also explains why there are no error bars or confidence intervals throughout the paper.\n\n2. The authors set the readout learning rate to be 100x higher than the network learning rate, which seriously confounds any claim that lazy learning arises naturally as a result of the large untrained weights.\n\n3. Batch normalization helps networks remain stable despite allowing weights to go beyond stable parameter regimes. On the other hand, not only does the currently proposed method not have any stability guarantee, it is training and updating weak weights safely within a dynamically-stable regime, which is the exact opposite of how batch normalization works. In other words, weights are not restricted in batch normalization, leading to faster learning with no care for stability, but are highly restricted in this method. As such, I feel that the analogy drawn is incorrect.\n\n4. There are some arguments in the introduction and throughout the rest of the text involving the scaling of neurons. Yet, all experiments are done with the same network size. Intuitively, it is easy to understand the idea that training only weak synapses may potentially resolve the scaling contradiction, but nothing has been done to justify this point. I do acknowledge how the synapses scale by construction in the supplementary, but experiments should be done with different scalings as well.\n\n5. I could not find what dt is, how the stimulus is actually fed into the network, and how long the network is run for, which is extremely crucial considering the continuous-time dynamics of the model. This further supports my point about the work being incomplete."

However, the excitatory populations also have separate strong and weak projections to themselves, and separate strong (proximal) and weak (distal) projections to inhibitory units. Is there any rationale for the EE, EI, and II strong vs weak weights?\n-\tThe strong weights (eq 7) are initialized as sparse, following typical E-I network initialization, but weak weights (eq 4) are initialized as dense. Is there any biological rationale for dense weak weights, or was this a practical design choice?\n-\tRegarding the separate shunting term (eq 6 & 8) I had to reference back to Hao 2009 to find justification for a separate shunting term in addition to a direct inhibition from the proximal interneurons. If the authors could find room for a 0.5-1 sentence rationale it could be helpful.\n-\tFigure 4 shows that none of the means of the weak weights change over the course of training, but is there any enforcement (eg: constrained optimization) or evidence that none of the units switched (which would be necessary for strictly following Dale\u2019s principle)?"
