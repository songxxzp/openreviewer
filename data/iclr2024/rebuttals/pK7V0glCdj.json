Their primary emphasis lies on introducing a novel acquisition function rooted in multivariate ranks. This innovative approach aims to alleviate the computational burden tied to the hypervolume or entropy calculations in established criteria. The process entails sampling from the posterior distribution to estimate uniform marginals, followed by rank assignment post a copula transformation. The study includes a comprehensive evaluation across various simplified scenarios, along with a selection of more complex test cases."

In appendix, I found the authors used multi-task GP. Another example is \\hat{f} in (3.8) suddenly appear without explanation (explained in the experimental section), by which the definition of the acquisition function becomes unclear at that point. \n\nAs mentioned above, the authors used multi-task GP, but for GP based MOO (i.e., BO), except for a few studies (e.g., Shah and Ghahraman 2016), typically uses independent GPs for multiple objectives. When the independent GPs are used, CDF is quite easy to evaluate (just by multiplying one dimensional CDFs). However, the author does not mention importance of modeling correlation among objectives. In practice, independent GPs often show sufficient (or better) performance compared with multi-task GP (for which task-correlation must be carefully tuned to achieve good performance). \n\nRationale behind the CDF based criterion is unclear. For simplicity, consider the case of independent Gaussian for each objective, which would be the simplest special case. Then, CDF becomes just a multiplication of each dimension of CDF, which intensely seeks a `specific direction' of the output space though, in MOO, the Pareto frontier should exist in a variety of direction of the output space. In this sense, in my current understanding, the proposed acquisition function is not appropriate for exploring the entire Pareto frontier that can be widely distributed in the output space. Even when correlated model is used, this problem would not be avoided."
