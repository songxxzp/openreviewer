The authors are suggested to discuss and conduct experiments on other bilevel optimization settings to demonstrate applicability of proposed algorithm.\n\n2. Overfitting issue can be easily addressed by early stopping. The authors are encouraged to make an experimental comparison between proposed dropout and early stopping to demonstrate the necessity of adopting dropout.\n\n3. In Theorem 2, the authors demonstrate that dropout rate \"influences\" the upper bound. However, it only influences the constant term and does not influence the convergence rate. Furthermore, the theoretical results only demonstrates the dropout rates \"influence\" the convergence but does not demonstrates it \"improves\" the convergence rate, even for the constant term. I expect to see inspiration about dropout rate selection from this theorem. The same issue also occurs for the Lemma 1 which is about variance term."

In our analysis, the dropout rate indeed influences the convergence rate. In our initial analysis, we simplified the dropout rate in the convergence rate estimation to $1$. We have now refined the proof for this aspect in the revised paper to make the convergence analysis more precise. The constant in the convergence rate is expressed as $O(\\frac{1}{\\bar p_\\lambda \\bar p_w})$, where $\\bar p_\\lambda$ and $\\bar p_w$ represent the maximum dropout rates related to the upper and lower level parameters, respectively. As can be seen, the convergence rate is lower when dropout is applied compared to when it is not. This observation is confirmed by our experimental results, particularly in Figure 2 in the revised version of the paper (Figure 4 in the original version)."

For example, why avoiding overfitting is important in bilevel optimization, that is, does bilevel structure exacerbate the overfitting issues? \n2. The convergence analysis is built up on the stationarity measure $\\frac{1}{T-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{T-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\\\|\\nabla F_{M^{k}}\\left(\\lambda^{k}\\right)\\right\\\\|^{2}$, which is the dropout bilevel objective. To fortify the analysis, it is conceivable to draw connections between this measure and the one based on the original bilevel objective $\\frac{1}{T-1} \\sum_{k=1}^{T-1} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\\\|\\nabla F\\left(\\lambda^{k}, w(\\lambda^{k})\\right)\\right\\\\|^{2}$. This could elucidate the relaxation error introduced by dropout and establish a guarantee for the original objective's convergence, thereby validating efficiency of the dropout approach more rigorously."

We have explained more about the motivation of considering the dropout in bilevel optimization in the introduction section of our revised version. In the context of a data cleaning task, the goal is to train a classifier using corrupted training data. As evidenced by our experiments, overfitting to the training data leads to a decrease in the testing accuracy of the classifier. Therefore, addressing the overfitting problem is essential to enhance the classifier's generalization ability in data cleaning tasks.\n\nRegarding meta-learning, the goal is to develop models capable of rapidly learning new tasks or adapting to new environments with minimal data. This objective can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. Overfitting in the model learned through bilevel optimization can result in diminished ability to learn new tasks. For instance, in classification problems, a model that overfits the training data may fail to effectively classify new data after only a few training steps. \n\n**Responses to weakness point 2:** Please see the global responses Section 2."

Please refer to global responses Section 3.\n\n**Responses to weakness point 2:** Thanks for the comments. Please note that a significant analytical challenge in our work is addressing the distribution of dropout masks. Given the nested structure of bilevel optimization, the dropout masks at both the lower and upper levels contribute to the complexity of estimating convergence rates. The referenced study [2] analyzes the convergence rate of bilevel optimization methods using stochastic gradients. Our work also addresses the convergence analysis of methods employing stochastic gradients. In contrast to [2], our study not only addresses the convergence rate of stochastic methods with stochastic gradients but also tackles the randomness introduced by dropout.\n\n**Responses to weakness point 3:** We now added additional experiments for the application of meta-learning. Please see the results in the global responses Section 1.\n\n**Responses to weakness point 4:** Thanks for your suggestion. We have made all captions shorter.\n\n**Responses to Questions point 1:** There are three distinct differences between our study and [1]:\n\n**1. Problem Settings:** The primary difference between our work and [1] lies in the problem settings. In [1], the dropout rate is treated as a variable to optimize at the upper level. Conversely, in our settings, the dropout rate is a fixed hyperparameter, not a variable requiring optimization. The objective of [1] is to find the optimal dropout rate for the lower-level optimization problem, categorizing it as a hyperparameter optimization problem. Our bilevel optimization model encompasses not only hyperparameter optimization but also extends to other applications such as data cleaning problems and meta-learning.\n\n**2. Approaches to Bilevel Optimization:** The methodologies employed in [1] represent a different genre. [1] focuses on approximating the solution of the lower problem with a neural network, effectively altering the lower-level problem in the bilevel optimization framework. In contrast, our work belongs to the genre that endeavors to solve the original lower-level problem.\n\n**3.Theoretical Considerations:** Owing to the differing approaches to bilevel optimization, the theoretical concerns of our work and [1] vary significantly. [1] analyzes the accuracy of the network's approximation of the lower-level solution, whereas we discuss the convergence rate of the bilevel method that applies dropout.\n\nIn summary, [1] fundamentally differs from our work in terms of the bilevel problems considered, the approaches used to solve these problems, and the resulting theoretical implications. We now include [1] as related work in the revised version.\n\n\n**Responses to Questions point 2:** Please see Section 2 of the global responses."
