This claim seems wholly false.\n* The work states multiple times that RLLTE is open-source or even ultra-open, but no link to code is given nor is a supplementary archive uploaded.\n* The introduced modularity seems to simply introduce many more hyperparameters, thus offloading a lot of critical choices to a potential user. The work fails to discuss how this affects users or how hyperparameters should be treated in RLLTE."

In particular SB3 does support parallel learning and hardware acceleration and while it doesn't natively support model deployment, it is explained in the documentation how to export models. With a user base of over 3k users, it clearly has a lot of momentum within the community, and so the authors would have to make a strong case that their system is genuinely superior to SB3. In addition, RL-Baselines3-zoo provides a training framework for SB3.\n\nIn addition to this, much of the language used within the paper feels like it is trying to oversell the framework. While I am sure that this is not the authors intensions, phrases such as \"RLLTE has been thoughtfully designed\", \"Beyond delivering top-notch algorithm implementations\", \"RLLTE is the first RL framework to build a complete and luxuriant ecosystem\". Such ideas should come through in the technical details, and not have to be sold using overly-confident language."
