                    "value": "Based on my reading of the manuscript, significant changes are needed before this work can be considered ready for publication at a top tier conference. In short: the experiments in the paper are far too limited and the biological insights provided are minimal. Details on my major concerns below:\n\n* **No new biological insights:** In the abstract the authors claim that their model \"offers a groundbreaking perspective on the biological complexity of COVID-19\". However, this (substantial) claim does not appear to be supported by the experiments presented in the manuscript. While it's reassuring that the proposed graph construction method leads to decent classification of disease severity (Table 3) using standard GNN architectures, this does not provide any new insights on COVID-19. Similar comments apply to the visualizations presented in Figures 1 and 2.\n* **No comparisons with GNN baselines:** The only performance comparisons presented by the author consist of different GNN architectures applied with the authors' proposed graph construction technique. Thus, it is impossible to understand how the authors' proposed method performs relative to previously GNN models for single cell data (such as those from Wang et al. 2021, Ma et al. 2023, or Efremova & Teichmann, 2020 cited by the authors.\n* **No comparisons with non-GNN baselines:** Beyond the lack of comparison with GNN baselines, it's not obvious to me that GNNs are the right tool for this problem, as opposed to e.g. well-established tools like Seurat/scanpy/scVI/etc. Thus, I believe it's critical that the authors also compared their work with standard non-GNN based workflows. The authors provide some visualizations of the representations learned by their method versus scVI in Figure 2, but qualitatively I don't see any major differences between the methods (i.e., healthy tend to separate from non-ICU/ICU, and there's some mixing between non-ICU and ICU). As a result, without additional results it's impossible to conclude that the authors' method provides any advantages over previous work.\n* **Limited discussion/comparison to previous work:** The authors are not the first to apply GNNs to single-cell transcriptome data from COVID-19 patients (see e.g. [1]). However, the authors do not include any discussion of previous similar work in this area, and thus it is difficult to assess how the proposed work relates to previous works in the literature.\n* **Limited details on the graph-building technique:** The authors' proposed technique for building the cell type <-> cell type interaction graph relies heavily on previously proposed tools (e.g. SpatalkDB, CellchatDB). However, little information about these tools is provided to the reader and thus it's difficult to understand their exact function. I would highly recommend that the authors remove the extensive discussions of hyperparameter settings (which can be relegated to the supplement) and instead provide more information on the tools used to build their graphs.\n\n[1]: Sehanobish, Ravindra, and van Dijk, \"Gaining Insight into SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Severity Using Self-supervised Edge Features and Graph Neural Networks\".

It is currently challenging to discern whether the novelty lies in the featurization process, the application of graph architectures, or a new benchmarking of existing architectures. A clearer delineation of what is novel in your work will greatly enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of your contributions. Also, considering the venue of this submission, it would be appropriate to emphasize the methodological contributions of your work. The title and abstract currently highlight the biological insights into COVID-19, which may not align perfectly with the venue's focus. If the primary contribution is methodological, consider reshaping the paper to foreground these innovations, using the COVID-19 application as a demonstrative example.\n\n- Inclusion of a Related Methods Section: A section discussing related methods and situating your work within the state-of-the-art would be highly beneficial. This would help readers understand how your approach compares to and potentially advances beyond current methodologies in this field.\n\n- Detailed Description of Featurization Process: The featurization process for both edge and node features is central to your methodology but is not thoroughly explained. A more detailed description, or at least a high-level overview with additional details provided in a supplementary section, would be valuable. Including a figure to illustrate this process would greatly aid in comprehension.\n\n- Clarification of Machine Learning Task (presentation / minor): The manuscript would benefit from a clear description of the machine learning task being addressed. It appears to be a supervised machine learning classification problem, but this is not explicitly stated. Clarifying the nature of the task will help readers understand the context and objectives of your study.\n\nThese suggestions are intended to enhance the clarity and impact of your manuscript. I am willing to revise my score if the authors can clarify these points."
