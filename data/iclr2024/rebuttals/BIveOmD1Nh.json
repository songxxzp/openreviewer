To address your questions and concerns:\n\n---\n\n**The selection of hyper-parameters seems opaque**\n\nWe have written a **new section (Appendix E; pages 22&ndash;23)** on hyperparameters, which hopefully clarifies the selection of both training-time and inference-time hyperparameters.\n\n* Our present settings for training-time hyperparameters provides a good balance between performance and runtime, and all the results in the main text were done with these settings. We also  present **new results** on a more thorough hyperparameter search and find that in certain cases the performance can be further improved.\n\n* Inference-time hyperparameters can indeed have an influence on the final outcome, and we provide a well-organized and visual analysis of this influence, based on existing full results from Appendix G.2.\n  \n---\n**Questions**\n\n\"Could you please clarify what type of information is captured by the different channels?\"\n\n* As with most deep learning models, it is difficult to interpret the semantic content of learned representations. We note that all the channels are treated identically, so the segmentation of different types of information is governed solely by training dynamics. We have provided visualizations in Appendix C (pages 19&ndash;20) which illustrate that the channels appear to differ from each other, but are hesitant to speculate about specific interpretations.\n\n\"Is the method predominantly dependent on geometric data, such as shape complementarity? Is the chemical data thoroughly utilized?\"\n\n* While it is not clear how to rigorously assess if a model is \"thoroughly utilizing\" chemical data, we have conducted two ablation experiments to try to probe this question.\n    * We run the default ESF-N model without providing chemical identities of any atoms. We call this **test-time chemical ablation**. The drawback of this approach is that the training and testing distributions are misaligned.\n    * We have trained from scratch a new model which has never seen any chemical identities. We call this **train-time chemical ablation.** The drawback of this approach is that the chemical identity of many atoms can be very easily deduced (for example, the identity of almost all sidechain atoms) and used implicitly.\n * We evaluate these two approaches on the conformer docking benchmark with PDBBind crystal structures, and compare them to the baseline. We can ascertain that the chemical information is contributing to the model performance, although the extent of this contribution is likely between the two extremes.\n\n|| TF %<2 A RMSD | TF Med. RMSD | RF %<2 A RMSD | RF Med. RMSD |\n|:-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|Baseline (ESF-N) | 72 | 1.10 | 73 | 1.00 |\n|Test-time ablation | 30 | 5.44 | 29 | 5.43 |\n|Train-time ablation | 65 | 1.21 | 65 | 1.20 |\n\n\"Ellen (cryoDRGN2) lays out a coarse-to-fine approach that subdivides the grid into finer segments. Would it be feasible to incorporate such a technique into this project?\"\n\n* This is an excellent suggestion, and one of many modifications or refined search procedures that could be incorporated into the method. This progressive subdivision would make the most sense as an improvement to the grid search over $SO(3)$ in the TF procedure.\n\n---\n\nPlease let us know if this resolves your concerns; if not, we would welcome the opportunity to address them further."

To address your questions and concerns:\n\n---\n\n**Too many model settings to choose from in practice**\n\nAt a high level, we agree that there is a balance between the customizability of a method and its ease of use. In our case, however, our method is actually very straightforward to use\u2014the workflow will dictate the model settings:\n* If the user has a set of candidate poses generated by some other software, we use the **Scoring** procedures, and the Optimization procedures are not relevant.\n* If the user does not have a set of candidate poses and wishes to generate them by optimizing our ESF scoring function, we use the **Optimization** procedures, and the Scoring procedures are not relevant.\n\nThe decision between **Rotational** and **Translational** modes is also **simpler than it may appear**. In the case of PDBBind, where we have a unique protein and ligand per complex, it is true that either mode could be used. However, in reality one almost always has an imbalance between the number of proteins and ligands. In this case, the runtime amortization considerations will additionally dictate the mode as the table below displays:\n\n| | Scoring | Optimization |\n| -: | :-: | :-: |\n| More proteins than ligands | **TS** | **TF** |\n| More ligands than proteins | **RS** | **RF** |\n\nFor example, the virtual screening-like PDE10A setting corresponds to the _lower right_ corner, and correspondingly we see in Table 3 (page 9) that the RF mode is preferable. To illustrate this more systematically, we have included a **new section (Appendix F; pages 24&ndash;25)** discussing how runtime amortization guides the selection of inference procedure. We hope this discussion makes the selection of model settings clear.\n\n---\n**The method is only evaluated on simplified tasks**\n\nWe have focused on these simplified tasks because they evaluate the quality of the scoring function and its optimization over SE(3), which is the focus of our contribution. Integration with the various design choices possible for other aspects of the virtual screening workflow can be quite subtle and would significantly expand the technical scope of the paper, and we think are best left to future work. With the present experiments, we believe our work is ready to serve as an upstream technical idea that can spur new directions of research in ML for docking.\n\n---\n**Lack of baselines**\n\nWe provide **new experimental results (Table 2; page 8)** comparing our method against recent deep learning baselines DiffDock and TANKBind. We adapt these methods to be used in scoring function modes:\n\n* For **DiffDock**, we use the confidence model to score all poses.\n* For **TankBind**, we compute the matrix of predicted interatomic distances with the given pocket, and use the so-called \u201cgeneration loss\u201d $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{generation}$ of TankBind to score all poses.\n\nWe do not evaluate these methods on pocket-level conformer docking as they cannot be easily adapted for this task.\n\nThe new results are excerpted below (Table 2; page 8):\n* Relative to **DiffDock**, we obtain similar or better performance with much faster runtime (3&ndash;5 orders of magnitude)\n* Relative to **TANKBind**, we obtain much better performance and similar per-pose runtime, although TANKBind is faster per-complex due to the lack of preprocessing steps (in the limit of many protein-complex pairs, this advantage vanishes).\n\n| | Crystal Top RMSD | Crytal % <2 A | ESMFold Top RMSD | ESMFold % <2 A | Runtime per-pose | Runtime per-complex\n| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n|TANKBind | 4.01 | 10 | 4.22 | 9 | 1.1 $\\mu$s | **62 ms** |\n|DiffDock | 0.66 | **87** | 2.01 | 50 | 62 ms | 2041 s|\n|Ours (ESF-TS) | **0.59** | **87** | **1.38** | **57** | **1.0 $\\mu$s** | 3.2 s |"

                        "value": "**Are there any ablation experiments on FFT?**\n\nWhile we do not report results using direct computation of the cross correlation in lieu of FFT, the significant asymptotic and practical runtime benefits of FFT are well-known. A brief conceptual analysis can illustrate this point:\n\n* In Table 1 (page 7), we see that the cost of a direct evaluation of the translational cross-correlation at a single point is 1.0 $\\mu$s. With FFTs, we evaluate $40^3 = 64000$ such cross correlations in 160 $\\mu$s, whereas a direct computation would take 64 ms. Hence, the FFT procedure gives a **400x speedup.**\n* Similarly, the cost of a direct evaluation of the rotational cross-correlation at a single orientation is 8.2 $\\mu$s. With FFTs, we evaluate 4608 such cross correlations in 650 $\\mu$s, whereas a direct computation would take 38 ms. Hence, the FFT procedure gives a **58x speedup.**\n\nRecall that in both the TF and RF procedures, we evaluate on the order of 1000 FFTs per complex, so substituting these FFTs with direct computation would result in docking runtimes on the order of 1 minute per complex, even in the limit with runtime amortization. Hence, without the FFT, our method compares unfavorably to existing runtimes and the advantage of learning a scalar-field based scoring function is definitively lost.\n\n---\n**Why is there no significant improvement in the scoring of crystal structures?**\n\nTraditional pairwise scoring functions aim to accurately model physical interactions; thus, they are expected to perform very well on crystal structures in which the protein is perfectly positioned to interact with the ligand. Indeed, the performance on scoring crystal structures (Table 2; page 8) is nearly perfect and offers little room for improvement. However, this does not reflect the use case in practice, where the ground-truth protein coordinates are unknown and must be approximated. Data-driven methods have the most to offer in the latter setting, represented by our strong improvements on ESMFold structures.\n\nOn the other hand, while the traditional scoring functions are accurate on crystal structures, they remain expensive to optimize. Our aim on crystal structures is to accelerate this optimization, rather than increase the accuracy of the scoring function itself. We accomplish this objective, learning a scoring function of comparable accuracy to existing pairwise scoring functions (Table 2; page 8) but allowing for significantly faster optimization (Table 3; page 9).\n\n---\n\nPlease let us know if this resolves your concerns; if not, we would welcome the opportunity to address them further."

The scoring function is defined as the cross-correlation of multi-channel ligand and protein scalar fields, and is parameterized by equivariant graph neural networks. The method is benchmarked on two simplified docking-related tasks: decoy pose scoring and rigid conformer docking. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves similar performance to existing scoring functions but with faster runtime. They also highlight the advantages of runtime amortization in virtual screening settings with a common binding pocket."

                        "value": "Thank you for the review and the assessment of the strengths of our work. To address your questions and concerns:\n\n---\n**Lack of Detailed Hyperparameter Analysis**\n\nWe have written a **new section (Appendix E; pages 22&ndash;23)** on hyperparameter analysis (both inference-time and training-time hyperparameters).\n\n\n* We provide a **more organized analysis** of the impact of various inference time hyperparameters with supporting tables and figures similar to the format requested. Thanks for the suggestion!\n* Our present settings for training-time hyperparameters provides a good balance between performance and runtime, and all the results in the main text were done with these settings. We also  present **new results** on a more thorough hyperparameter search and find that in certain cases the performance can be further improved.\n\n---\n**Limited Discussion on Runtime Amortization**\n\nWe have written a **new section (Appendix F; pages 24&ndash;25)** discussing the implications of runtime amortization. We would also like to clarify a few points:\n\n* The amortization is merely the re-use of quantities that would otherwise be identically computed multiple times. Hence, there is no associated runtime-performance tradeoff (performance is unaffected).\n* A more general discussion of the runtime-performance tradeoff of our method relative to other methods is provided in Appendix G.3.\n* We illustrate the practical implications of runtime amortization via the PDE10A test set, which was collected specifically for this purpose. While it may appear limited, this is actually the largest possible illustration because PDB structures with different druglike molecules binding to otherwise identical protein structures are rare (to our knowledge PDE10A is the largest such set).\n---\n**Evaluation on simplified docking-related tasks**\n\nWe have focused on these simplified tasks because they evaluate the quality of the scoring function and its optimization over SE(3), which is the focus of our contribution. Integration with the various design choices possible for other aspects of the virtual screening workflow can be quite subtle and would significantly expand the technical scope of the paper, and we think are best left to future work. With the present experiments, we believe our work is ready to serve as an upstream technical idea that can spur new directions of research in ML for docking.\n\n---\n**Comparisons with other SOTA/scoring functions**\n\nWe provide **new experimental results (Table 2; page 8)** comparing our method against DiffDock and TANKBind. We adapt these methods to be used in scoring function modes:\n\n* For **DiffDock**, we use the confidence model to score all poses.\n* For **TankBind**, we compute the matrix of predicted interatomic distances with the given pocket, and use the so-called \u201cgeneration loss\u201d $\\mathcal{L}_\\text{generation}$ of TankBind to score all poses.\n\n**EquiBind** cannot be configured to either score a given pose or to dock a rigid conformer into a given pocket, making a direct comparison impossible. \n\n**Re: SMINA**: we make a terminology distinction between the \u201cscoring function\u201d and the \u201cdocking program.\u201d The Smina _docking program_ is the parent program of the Gnina _docking program_ which we use to run baselines (the two are identical except the latter also supports the CNN-based Gnina _scoring function_). The older Smina _docking program_ by default optimizes the Vina _scoring function_: hence, **the results from our Vina rows are equivalent to those reported as \u201cSmina\u201d elsewhere.**\n\nThe new results are excerpted below (Table 2; page 8):\n* Relative to **DiffDock**, we obtain similar or better performance with much faster runtime (3&ndash;5 orders of magnitude)\n* Relative to **TANKBind**, we obtain much better performance and similar per-pose runtime, although TANKBind is faster per-complex due to the lack of preprocessing steps (in the limit of many protein-complex pairs, this advantage vanishes).\n\n| | Crystal Top RMSD | Crytal % <2 A | ESMFold Top RMSD | ESMFold % <2 A | Runtime per-pose | Runtime per-complex\n| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n|TANKBind | 4.01 | 10 | 4.22 | 9 | 1.1 $\\mu$s | **62 ms** |\n|DiffDock | 0.66 | **87** | 2.01 | 50 | 62 ms | 2041 s|\n|Ours (ESF-TS) | **0.59** | **87** | **1.38** | **57** | **1.0 $\\mu$s** | 3.2 s |\n\n\n---\nPlease let us know if this resolves your concerns; if not, we would welcome the opportunity to address them further."
