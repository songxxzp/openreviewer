We respond to your individual queries below; we hope the changes to the paper and the responses address your concerns.\n\n> Weak theoretical justification: diffusion models enjoy strong theoretical foundations, the forward and the backward process are proven to share the same marginal distribution. However, it is not clear to me whether the backward process of Nearest-neighbor Trajectory Stitching still has similar theoretical guarantees.\n\nInteresting question: our theoretical justification given in theorem 5.1 relates likelihood maximization to behaviour cloning for a given dataset. While trajectory stitching is a heuristic data argumentation process, it only results in a different augmented dataset. Our theorem still applies in the sense that for the augmented dataset, likelihood maximization is still related to behaviour cloning. In short, our theorem justifies using a diffusion-like process for goal-conditioned RL, starting from a given dataset. Introducing data augmentation and model into the picture is separated since they effectively change/update the dataset.\n\n> Limited range of applications: Nearest-neighbor Trajectory Stitching seems to be designed for some specific applications. The generalizability remains unclear.\n\nThe trajectory stitching operation can be used with any suitable distance metric. In particular, for images and cases where such a metric is not obvious, the trajectory stitching can be performed in a latent space by learning a mapping from the state space to a low-dimensional space using any viable representation learning method. This commonly used technique has been effective for dealing with high-dimensional and complex data (such as images). We have also added a discussion in Section 7 highlighting this point.\n\n> Misleading title: Diffusion models have a relatively clear definition now. While there are \"forward\" and \"backward\" processes in this paper, this algorithm does not fall into the class of diffusion models.\n\nDenoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) [1], use Gaussian noise for the forward process, but they represent \u201cone\u201d possible type of diffusion model. In its general form [2], a diffusion model requires a forward noising Markov chain and a denoising model. In RL, the forward process comprises taking actions starting from the goal, which leads to new states different from the goal. Since we are dealing with an MDP, the forward and backward chains thus generated are Markov chains by definition. Our approach is indeed a diffusion process, and we discuss the connection and differences with DDPM in Appendix C. Also, Theorem 5.1 is reminiscent of a related  proof in [2].\n\n[1] Ho, Jonathan, Ajay Jain, and Pieter Abbeel. \"Denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 33 (2020): 6840-6851.\n\n[2] Sohl-Dickstein, Jascha, Eric Weiss, Niru Maheswaranathan, and Surya Ganguli. \"Deep unsupervised learning using nonequilibrium thermodynamics.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 2256-2265.

From this perspective, merlin has only limited novelty. Start with the cleanest method, merlin build policy upon s,g,h instead of s,g by GCSL. Although the merlin shows better results in the motivation example, I think it's because of the inclusion of a more stable time guide. \n\nWe extensively discuss and contrast Merlin and GCSL in Section 6. As stated, GCSL also allows for conditioning on the time horizon, but its authors did not find any significant difference with and without the time horizon. In Merlin, the inclusion of time is coupled with variance prediction (see Figure 3), and is one reason Merlin is superior to GCSL. This is also what practically sets apart score-based models and diffusion models in the generative modeling task and, therefore, should not be deemed insignificant. Also, as discussed in Section 6, the forward view of GCSL and the backward view of Merlin can result in very different outcomes. Consider the model-based approach: a forward dynamics model generates trajectories without guarantees on the distribution over the goal state. In contrast, in a reverse dynamics model, one has control over this distribution.\n\n> I observe that Merlin-NP and Merlin-P show better results in the experiments, but they can be considered as GCSL + temporal constraints + reverse dynamics model (Wang et al.) + trajectory stitching (a commonly used data augmentation method in OfflineRL). These other components can be easily combined with the universal GCRL approach, so the performance gains are no surprise. \n\nWe are unaware of any prior offline RL method that uses trajectory stitching for data augmentation. Could the reviewer please provide a reference? While there is a parallel between GCSL and Merlin, the diffusion perspective only applies to Merlin, and as explained in response to the previous questions, this makes a significant difference, both in theory (e.g., theorem 5.1) and practice (experimental results). We also ran GCSL+ forward trajectory stitching to show that it remains inferior to Merlin-NP, the results are presented in Appendix G.\n\n> The approach seems sensitive to hyperparameters like time horizon and hindsight ratio. I'm not sure that good performance comes from hyperparameter tuning.\n\nWhile we agree and have discussed this in sections 6 and 7, performance sensitivity to hindsight ratio is not unique to Merlin, and one observes the same for most of the offline GCRL methods. For each baseline, we used the best-performing hindsight ratio as reported in their original works. For transparency, we provide an ablation of these hyper-parameters in Section 6.1. More generally, RL methods are notorious for being sensitive to hyper-parameters, and most methods require some hyper-parameter tuning to be effective.\n\n> What metric and distance threshold works best for the trajectory stitching? Is there a principled way to set this? \n\nThe choice of metric and the distance threshold is discussed in Appendix D.3.. \n\n> In appendix table 5, I have observed that there is not much difference in success rate between Merlin and DQL, GCSL and other methods, whereas there is a bigger difference using reward metric, why is that? Success rate should be a common metric for evaluating a GCRL algorithm.\n\nThe discounted return takes into account how fast the agent reaches the goal and whether it stays in the goal region thereafter. The success rate is important but does not provide the full picture - multiple methods may successfully solve the task but may take a different numbers of steps to reach the goal, and some may deviate from the goal after successfully reaching it. This is briefly discussed in Section 6."

                        "value": "Thank you for the valuable feedback! We respond to your individual queries below, we hope the changes to the paper and the responses address your concerns.\n\n> The introduction could be improved by making the exact problem setting more clear from the beginning\n\nWe have expanded upon the explanation of goal-conditioned RL in the introduction to make the problem setting more clear. The formal introduction in Section 3.2 specifies the notation and the problem setting used throughout the paper. We hope the changes help improve the clarity of the paper.\n\n> The nearest neighbor-based approach makes the assumption that close states are connected/ can be accessed from each other; this should be discussed. This could also be evaluated by designing a more complex toy environment based on the environment in Figure 2.\n\nWe have added experiments in Appendix B using a more complex toy environment, which adds numerous walls that the agent must learn to navigate around. We observe that Merlin successfully learns to navigate around the walls in contrast to GCSL. For more complex state spaces (for example, images, where nearby states in pixel-space may not be directly accessible), the trajectory stitching operation can be performed in a learned latent space by learning a mapping from the state space to a low-dimensional space using any viable representation learning method. This commonly used technique has been effective for dealing with high-dimensional and complex data. We have also added a discussion in Section 7 highlighting this point.\n\n> The related work description of Janner et all is not exactly correct, as it is not full trajectories that are noised but just trajectory segments\n\nWe have corrected the statement in the related works section; thank you for pointing this out.\n\n> A comparison to the related works such as [A] would be appreciated\n\nDue to the limited time period of this discussion phase, we were unable to produce full results for this work; we shall work on it for the final version of the paper. However, note that according to the ICLR guidelines, it is not expected to compare with works that are published after 28 May, 2023.\n\n> An ablation on trajectory stitching is only implicitly done (by defining different algorithms)\n\nCould the reviewer please clarify? We report the performance with and without trajectory stitching, which demonstrates the effect of this technique on the performance. Could the reviewer elaborate on the suggested experimental setup?\n\n> A motivation for the goal-conditioned problem setting (instead of starting with just a single goal setting) would be beneficial\n\nWe assume the reviewer is referring to the experiments in Section 4.1. We have added results for the multi-goal setting in Appendix B, where the forward diffusion is performed starting from several goals. During evaluation, the policy is conditioned on one particular goal. Thank you for the suggestion.\n\n> The description of the method is rather confusing. First, it is explained that the trajectory is denoised, which would result in a denoising of states. However, in the following sections, suddenly the action is denoised (see section 4.1)\n\nThe diffusion process in Merlin is over states. The forward process comprises of taking actions starting from the goal, which can be seen as equivalent to adding Gaussian noise in diffusion models, which leads to new states different from the goal. The policy, which is akin to the score function (as explained in Section 4.1), produces the action to reach the appropriate states. In this sense, the action is analogous to the predicted noise in diffusion models, which serves to \u201cdenoise\u201d the states towards the goal. We have added a sentence in Section 4.1 to improve clarity.\n\n> Is the policy a diffusion model? It is mentioned that BC is performed at the end of section 5.2.\n\nYes, see the previous answer and Section 4.1 for an explanation. Theorem 5.1 proves that maximizing the ELBO in the diffusion process becomes equivalent to behavior cloning in the offline setting. \n\n> The paper would definitely benefit from an algorithm description of the method\n\nWe have added formal algorithms for the reverse model rollout (for Merlin-P) and for Merlin, including all its variations in Appendix D. If the reviewer finds it useful, page limit permitting, we can move it to the main body of the paper."

We This is a well-known failure of model-based RL, due to compounding model error over multiple time steps especially in higher dimensions, and is briefly discusses in Section 6.

                        "value": "Thank you for the provided clarifications and the additional experiments.\n\nI am not sure I would see nearest-neighbor trajectory stitching as a novel contribution to the field. See e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12026.pdf or https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-019-02813-w. While the stitching algorithm proposed in this work may have some technical differences from previous works, I would not consider it a significant contribution. Further, as the authors pointed out themselves, it does not generalize to problems with more complex state spaces where a \"connection\" between nearest neighbors cannot be assumed to be given.\n\nHowever, the MERLIN algorithm itself is a novel contribution and the additional results provided in Appendix G suggest that it is performant. One thing I am still confused about: The work assumes that actions can be simulated as random noise added to the states. Does this assume that the state and action space are of the same dimension? Or do you consider the Gaussian noise as a meta-action (i.e. a change in the state), which is then passed to a low-level controller that executes the according control action? \nFurther, assuming that any state is connected to the same state with added Gaussian noise similarly assumes that these states are connected. Specifically, this assumes that any state is connected to a noised version of itself, through taking a single action. This appears as a very strong assumption which I find is not discussed in much detail in the paper. Hence, I am curious how this method could generalize to state spaces where this assumption does not hold (e.g. image inputs)."

                        "value": "Thank you for the valuable feedback! We respond to your individual queries below, we hope the changes to the paper and the responses address your concerns.\n\n> The trajectory stitching method is only usable if distance between two states can be defined. What if states are observed via images? Additionally what if distance between states is not indicative of their relation to one another in a sequential process. What if there are discontinuities in states?\n\nInteresting point! Indeed trajectory stitching operation can be used with any suitable distance metric. In particular, for images and cases where such a metric is not obvious, the trajectory stitching can be performed in a latent space by learning a mapping from the state space to a low-dimensional space using any viable representation learning method. This commonly used technique has been effective for dealing with high-dimensional and complex data (such as images). We have added a discussion in Section 7 highlighting this point.\n\n> Transition from 3.2 to 4 is abrupt. No additional information on issues with offline reinforcement learning.\n\nIn Section 1, we discuss the inaccuracies in value estimation, especially for out-of-distribution actions, which can cause policies to diverge. The second issue is that the static dataset provides limited state-goal pairs for training policies. Since having such a discussion in technical details is not feasible given our constraints, we do this at the high level in Section 1, and reserve Section 3.2   for basic notation and fundamentals of offline RL which is used in the subsequent sections.\n\n> GCSL seems to be a very important concept which is used as a baseline algorithm in this paper. Yet there is no description of it in related work. How is GCSL different from GCRL?\n\nGCRL is a particular framework of RL where the objective is defined in terms of the desired goal that the policy is expected to achieve. GCSL [1] is one proposed method to solve the GCRL problem. We have described GCSL in the related work section under the paragraph \u2018Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning\u2019, and again in the Experiments section under the paragraph \u2018Algorithms.\u2019 We have expanded the introduction to make the setting of interest more clear.\n\n> Figure 7 is referenced in the main text but appears in the appendix.\n\nThis was a typing error, it should refer to Figure 4, which shows the generalization of Merlin to new goals. Thank you for pointing this out.\n\n> is the method applicable with partially observable states e.g., images?\n\nThis is an interesting suggestion and is one of the possible avenues for future work. In principle, it should work for POMDPs if we use recurrent networks for the policy and the reverse dynamics model (in the case of Merlin-P). Using a recurrent network to keep track of the entire history of partially observed states has been shown to be effective [2,3].\n\n\n[1] Ghosh, Dibya, Abhishek Gupta, Ashwin Reddy, Justin Fu, Coline Manon Devin, Benjamin Eysenbach, and Sergey Levine. \"Learning to Reach Goals via Iterated Supervised Learning.\" In International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020.\n\n[2] Hausknecht, Matthew, and Peter Stone. \"Deep recurrent q-learning for partially observable mdps.\" In 2015 aaai fall symposium series. 2015.\n\n[3] Ni, Tianwei, Benjamin Eysenbach, and Ruslan Salakhutdinov. \"Recurrent Model-Free RL Can Be a Strong Baseline for Many POMDPs.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 16691-16723.
