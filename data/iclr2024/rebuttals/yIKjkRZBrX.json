It assumes that novel state-actions in data are critical dicision points and the low-level skills should terminate at such points. Thus, the paper proposes NBDI, training an ICM to estimate the state-action novelty and labeling the termination for each data sample. Then, the paper adopts the method of SPiRL, training a latent skill representation, an action decoder (with a termination decoder), and a skill prior, providing temporal abstractions for training a high-level policy with RL. Experiments in Maze show that the method outperforms SPiRL."

                    "value": "1. The assumption that \"novel state-actions are critical decision points\" is **too strong**. I find that datasets used in this paper just meet this assumption: in Maze, the behavior policy only chooses diverse actions at crossroads; in Kitchen, the dataset consists of expert policies accomplishing a fixed set of skills, making the actions diverse at skill success points only. If we use other environments (e.g., robotic tasks without clearly defined skills) or non-expert data collection policies with stochasticity, this assumption will no longer hold, and it is doubtful whether NBDI can outperform SPiRL.\n\n2. In implementations, the ICM is trained and evaluated on a fixed dataset, which **may not reflect the notion of \"novelty\"** discussed in the paper. In the original usage of ICM, it can estimate novelty in online RL, since the model cannot predict unseen transitions. However, this paper uses ICM to estimate novelty for the training data. Assuming that the model can overfit the dataset, the ICM losses on all training samples are small, thus ICM can fail to evaluate the state-action novelty in the dataset. \n\n3. According to the context, the presentation of the Theorem in Section 4.2 seems redundant. The theorem tells that breaking skills into shorter pieces can improve the high-level controller. But the paper studies how to determine the skill termination points, instead of breaking pre-defined fixed-length skills into shorter pieces. Also, the conclusion in the theorem is straight-forward, while the detailed notations (Q and V) in it are no longer used in the paper. I think the the theorem should be moved to the Appendix.\n\n4. The method is incremental to SPiRL. Its improvement on the two robotic simulation tasks is small, according to Figure 6."

In the experiments, how did you adjust the model capacity and training steps of ICM? If ICM overfits on training data, can it still represent state-action novelty, as I discussed in Weakness (2)?\n\n3.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer Yx7H,\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the thorough and constructive comments. We hope we can address your concerns below.\n\n**1. Its improvement on the two robotic simulation tasks is small, according to Figure 6.**\n\nThank you for pointing out this. We've incorporated Table 1 to highlight the degree of quantitative improvement, especially in complex environments, compared to SPiRL[2]. Please refer to the general response to see the details.\n\n**2. In robotic tasks without clearly defined skills it is doubtful whether NBDI can outperform SPiRL.**\n\nThank you for your insightful feedback. In the sparse block stacking environment, the agent needs to stack blocks on top of each other. Since the agent\u2019s sole objective is to stack as many blocks as possible, this environment can be regarded as a robotic task without clearly defined skills (whereas kitchen has clearly defined subtasks). Please refer to Appendix B for more details. \n\nTable 1 shows that NBDI outperforms SPiRL in the sparse block stacking environment (robotic tasks without clearly defined skills) with an improvement rate of 67.16%. Note it is a higher improvement rate compared to robotic task with clearly defined skills (kitchen: 22.33%). The significance of learning variable length skills with state-action novelty increases in environments lacking clearly defined subtasks (sparse block stacking).\n\n**3. With non-expert data collection policies with stochasticity, it is doubtful whether NBDI can outperform SPiRL.**\n\nThank you for your constructive advice. We've added a new section (Appendix C) to investigate the extent to which our proposed method depends on the quality of the offline dataset. Please refer to the general response to see the details. \n\n**4. How did you adjust the model capacity and training steps of ICM[1]? If ICM overfits on training data, can it still represent state-action novelty, as I discussed in Weakness (2)?**\n\nThank you for raising this important point. We have included a section (Appendix E) to show that the estimated state-action novelty is not much influenced by the number of parameters or dataset used to train the model. We also doubled the number of training steps, but observed that the scale didn't differ significantly. \n\n**5. When generating termination labels for the dataset, how to convert the continuous prediction loss of ICM into binary termination labels? Does this require selecting a threshold manually?**\n\nThank you for pointing out this. Empirically, we discovered that state-actions falling within the top 1% of the prediction error percentile serves well as critical decision points, and used the corresponding threshold to learn the termination distribution.\n\n**6. The theorem tells that breaking skills into shorter pieces can improve the high-level controller. But the paper studies how to determine the skill termination points, instead of breaking pre-defined fixed-length skills into shorter pieces.**\n\nSPiRL basically extracts random fixed-length action sequences from the offline dataset by regarding the fixed-length action sequence in the dataset as pre-defined skills. On the other hand, our approach tries to break long action sequences using state-action novelty to learn better defined skills. Given that we are able to learn optimal skill (high-level) policy, the optimal way of defining skill would be using low-level actions directly as skills. In practice, however, shorter skills will increase the difficulty of learning, leading to poor skill policy. This is why we need a more clever and efficient break down of skills that resembles terminations with optimal improvement as shown in the Theorem [3] and the Figure 4, while obtaining similar temporal abstraction.\n\n[1] Deepak Pathak, Pulkit Agrawal, Alexei A Efros, and Trevor Darrell.

As the authors also mentioned in the introduction section, option framework and its related algorithms typically learn a termination condition which functions as a tool to determine whether the agent needs to switch to a different skill. Several recent papers [1, 2, 3] propose to do skill/option discovery from offline data while learning a flexible termination condition just like this paper. But none of them are compared in the empirical results or discussed in the related work section. The proposed approach is only compared to SPiRL which uses a fixed skill length.\n\n2. As it's a offline RL test setting, I think standard offline RL algorithms should be compared to instead of SAC. Moreover, as a general skill discovery method, I would suggest the authors test the proposed approach on more domains.\n\n[1]. Learning options via compression. Neurips 2022.\n[2].

The authors propose to detect such decision points using state-action novelty. The resulting algorithm, Novelty-based Decision Point Identification (NBDI), learns skills together with their termination probability and a prior over the skill space using a latent variable model similar to SpiRL [1]. The authors furthermore provide a complementary perspective on variable termination of skills by relating it to the potential performance gains achieved by terminating and switching to higher-value options, arguing that state-action novelty serves as a proxy for situations where this is likely to be beneficial. Experiments in two maze environments and two robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that the variable-length skills learned by NBDI lead to better performance in downstream tasks.\n\n[1] Karl Pertsch, Youngwoon Lee, and Joseph Lim.

In the experiments section the paper then briefly mentions that Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM) is used to obtain state-action novelty values. However, ICM obtains its intrinsic motivation signal from the prediction error of the next state in a learned feature space which is conceptually somewhat different. I think it would be a good idea to discuss to which extent the exact nature of the curiosity signal influences the learned skills.\n\nAs evident in the motivating examples, the learned skill termination probabilities depend on the data, in particular on where different actions have been chosen frequently. This poses the question of how dependent NBDI is on a suitable structure being present in the offline dataset. For example, could NBDI work with exploratory data, and if yes, under which circumstances? How does the complexity of the environment influence the requirements on the data? A discussion of these questions would be a good addition to the paper.\n\nOverall the algorithm is fairly close to SpiRL but this is made transparent so it is not really a problem.\n\nThe additional ablations in Appendix A are quite interesting, in particular, the study of the novelty threshold.

Please refer to the general response to see the details. \n\n**2. How dependent NBDI is on a suitable structure being present in the offline dataset. For example, could NBDI work with exploratory data, and if yes, under which circumstances?**\n\nWe appreciate your constructive advice for the experiment. We've introduced a new section (Appendix C) to explore to what extent our proposed method is depend on the quality of the offline dataset. Please refer to the general response to see the details. \n\n**3. How does the complexity of the environment influence the requirements on the data?**\n\nWe have also added a section (Appendix D) to investigate whether meaningful decision points can be found in complex physics simulation environments. Please refer to Appendix D for more details.\n\n**4. In the paragraph \u201cOption Framework\u201d, in the definition $\\beta:S^+\\to[0,1] $ the symbol  is not defined anywhere. What does it stand for?**\n\nWe apologize for the confusion caused. We initially intended to define $S^+$ as the termination set in accordance with [2], but we deemed it unnecessary and substituted it with the state space $S$.\n\n**5.

I appreciate the work that went into the additional sections.\n\n1. Thank you for the clarifications with respect to the use of ICM. Two quick questions about this: As you train on the same transitions you evaluate the model on, how do you make sure that you are not overfitting to the dataset? There is furthermore one sentence I did not quite understand in Appendix B: \"low prediction error occurs in states where we do not have multitude of plausible actions, or rare configuration ((D), (E), (F)\" Why does low prediction error correspond to rare configurations?\n\n2. The experiments with a lower quality, noisy policy are interesting. It looks like NBDI is able to cope with such data to some extent so this is a good addition.\n\n3. The example decision points with the Ant being able to flip or stabilize on its legs makes a lot of sense, thank you. The other decision points are a bit harder to interpret from images. A video might help with that. It makes sense that completely random data does not result in interpretable or useful decision point and will therefore have a negative impact on the performance of NBDI. As long as this is made transparent in the paper, this is fine, I think.\n\n4. Thank you!\n\n5. Ok, great. I think the equation is clear now."

However the exact details for how the state-action novelty module is trained is not explained in the paper (box (i) in the method figure). The paper includes some description of characterizing novelty as inverse visitation count, so do the authors explicitly maintain counts of each seen state? (This will be difficult to scale to environments with continuous states and actions). Or is there some other metric of pseudo counts, involving density estimation? What is the relative effect of using different means to estimate the novelty metric, to predict termination? The reason for this particular analysis is that the novelty estimation is the main contribution of this paper. \n\n2. Significance of contribution \n\nThe proposed method heavily builds on prior work [1], for the components that learn skills and perform RL in the skill space. From the experimental results, the quantitive gains over [1] seem very marginal in the more complex environments (sparse block stacking, kitchen). Can the authors include some analysis of how their discovered skills differ qualitatively in these more complex envs, as compared to [1]?. What are the specific cases in these environments that variable length skills are actually helpful/needed? \n\n\n[1] - Pertsch, Karl, Youngwoon Lee, and Joseph Lim. \"Accelerating reinforcement learning with learned skill priors.\" Conference on robot learning.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer 6rC9,\n\nThank you for the valuable feedback. We hope we can address your concerns below.\n\n**1. Clarity of proposed approach (state-action novelty estimation)**\n\nWe apologize for the missing details. We've included a section (Appendix B) that details our application of the Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM)[1] in calculating state-action novelty. Please refer to the general response to see the details.\n\n**2. The quantitive gains over SPiRL[2] seems very marginal in the more complex environments (sparse block stacking, kitchen).**\n\nThank you for pointing out this. We've included Table 1 to highlight the extent of quantitative improvement over SPiRL (including complex environments). Please refer to the general response to see the details.\n\n**3. Can the authors include some analysis of how their discovered skills differ qualitatively in these more complex environments, as compared to [2]? What are the specific cases in these environments that variable length skills are actually helpful/needed?**\n\nThank you for the valuable suggestion. We've included Figure 11 (Appendix B) to illustrate states in the sparse block stacking environment that NBDI would learn to terminate (A, B, C) and states it would not learn to terminate (D, E, F). NBDI would learn to terminate in states where the agent has multitude of plausible actions (A, B, C) (e.g. choose to lift the block below or to move towards other blocks), while SPiRL would terminate in random states (A, B, C, D, E, F). As indicated by the improvement rate in Table 1, the significance of learning variable length skills with state-action novelty becomes increasingly crucial in environments lacking clearly defined subtasks (sparse block stacking), or in more complex settings (maze 40x40).\n\n[1] Deepak Pathak, Pulkit Agrawal, Alexei A Efros, and Trevor Darrell.
