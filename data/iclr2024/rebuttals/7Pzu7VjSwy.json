Class-incremental learning is of great importance to the machine learning field. The proposed method is a combination of EMA and SI, which averages the model parameters among three models (working model, short-term model, and long-term model). The EMA process is combined with SI to weigh the importance of each parameter. The proposed method is evaluated on several datasets against other baseline methods."

                    "value": "1. The novelty of the proposed method is not very strong. The current method somehow combines EMA and SI, making it incremental. The idea of using the working model and memory model is also similar to [1]. Although the idea of short-term memory and long-term memory is interesting, these models are utilized similarly in the updating process (e.g., Eq. 1 and Eq. 2). I may assume a complex learning system that includes the long-term recovery and short-term memory after reading the abstract, while the methodology is not so compatible with the \u201cgreat CLS theory.\u201d\n2. Although using more parameters, the performance does not show substantial improvement. The current method requires at most three times a memory scale than the vanilla baseline. However, it shows little improvement to other baselines, given the extra budget. Besides, there is a similar work [2] that only uses at most two times the memory budget, which should be compared to in the experiments. \n3. Too many hyper-parameters make the model fragile. Eq. 1 includes two hyper-parameters for the thresholding. As shown in Table 10, the choice of these parameters differs substantially from dataset to dataset, making the model fragile. Moreover, three more hyperparameters in the table need to be grid searched.\n4. Lacking comparison on large-scale datasets. It is essential to perform the comparison on ImageNet1000 and show the ability of class-incremental learning algorithms with large-scale inputs.\n5. Unclear points. The total loss in Eq. 6 is a combination of cross-entropy and consistency. What does sf mean in the cross-entropy loss? Besides, the description of consistency loss is also ambiguous. What is the \u201coptimal strategy\u201d? If the consistency loss is the MSE loss, why not show it with notations? These unclear points make the paper half-baked and less convincing.\n\n[1] Error Sensitivity Modulation based Experience Replay: Mitigating Abrupt Representation Drift in Continual Learning.

This could be trivial for distincting the these two models. The key idea here is to make the stable model preserve more general information among all tasks and make the plastic model retain more recent task's information, but with this trivial difference, it is hard to say the goal has been achieved. Thus I am not sure what are the actual roles of them in this architecture. Further, the author also need to provide more insight for holding two Semantic Memory Models, that's say, why only one semantic memory model is not enough to hold old knowledge?\n+ Some training details should be further clarified. For example, for the process of (1) momentum update of Semantic Memory Models (Eq. 1), (2) momentum update of working model (Eq. 2), I wonder, after back-propogating update the working model, should first do (1) and then (2)? or reversed\uff1f\n+ During testing after the training of each incremental task.

However, during updating the working model, the previous method also contains the knowledge distillation from the semantic memory models to the working model (i.e., an MSE loss between the logits of the working model and semantic memory models), which is also a type of so-called forward transport. The proposed BDT in this paper is an additional way of forward transport.\n+ Besides, the author mentioned that \u2018the representation of new knowledge is often impaired due to the excessive integration of the retained old knowledge under the Class-IL setting\u2019. However, there is no explanations or experiments to illustrate how the excessive integration of old knowledge degrades new knowledge, and how the proposed method alleviates the excessive integration. \n+ The author does not show the forgetting measure of the compared methods. From Fig. 3, comparing ERMER, the proposed method seems to tend to sacrifice accuracy on the old tasks to achieve a better performance on the new task. This obeys the spirit of continual learning, which mainly hopes to alleviate forgetting rather than only improve average accuracy.\n+ To calculate the parameter importance, SMT has to store parameters of the old working model after the training on the last task, which enlarges the requirements of the model storage and is unfair to other comparison methods.\n+ The author does not explain how to choose the stable model, plastic model, both of them or even none of them in Eq. (2). \n+ From Alg. 1, it seems like a two-stage approach, where the first stage is to update the working model by SGD, and the second stage is to fine-tune the working model by SMT. It would be better if the author could provide a specific and detailed algorithm or pseudo code about BDT-SMT."
