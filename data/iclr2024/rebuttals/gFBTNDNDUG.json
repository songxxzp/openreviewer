They find particular instances where the optimization of this generally hard problem can be performed more efficiently from a dual characterization of the optimization. Their framework works particularly well when the Hamiltonian is linear in the density variable and they give special cases where this occurs. The experiments focus on RNA sequencing tasks for which their method seem to perform well."

The AC asked me still to provide a high level review and I will try my best to do so below.  I will refrain from making strong statements about the paper due to my lack of expertise. \n\nThe strength of this paper seems to lie in its efficiency in addressing a potentially challenging optimal transport problem. Their reformulation of the optimal transport into an efficient scheme is noteworthy to me. Their algorithm is clearly laid out in section 3 and I could follow along relatively well, albeit many choices such as the neural network architecture are not specified (perhaps to give one flexibility in this choice)."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "As stated above, I am not an expert in this area, and reading this paper, I was impressed by the rigor and extensive detail of their approach. Nevertheless, in the end, I could not come to a concrete conclusion regarding its novelty and relevance for someone who is not specifically in their field. Let me explain a bit further.\n\nFirst, they propose a method which they say is effective and efficient in a wide variety of domains including transport with constraints and unbalanced transport. On this point, my opinion seems to agree with the authors overall, but the specifics contradict the generality at times. For example, the constraints that the authors are able to enforce are constraints on the marginal values themselves. However, what if the constraints come in a different form, e.g. a symmetry in the problem or distributions? This happens all the time in physics and it's not obvious to me that the approach covers a constraint like that. \n\nSecond, the authors motivate this problem with a RNA sequencing task saying that we can only observe population statistics and we want to infer individual statistics from this. I can understand this would be useful. But looking at the experiments, none of the experiments test this specific point. All the experiments are predicting population statistics. This may be an issue in how one collects the data rather than the learning of that data, but nonetheless it leaves me unconvinced that this approach actually achieves the high level goal.\n\nTypos/grammar and notational comments:\n- pg. 2: \"which forms the basis the Lagrangian formulation\u201d\n- section 2.1 writes the Lagrangian as inputting path variables, but later on, the inputs to the Lagrangian are momentum variables. This should be consistent.\n- pg. 3 grammar: \"allows us to consider of potential energy functionals which depend\"\n- Hyperlinks for OT, SB, etc. seem to be broken. What are these supposed to point to?\n\nQuestions:\n- Below eq 27, the authors say that they perform optimization with respect to $\\eta$ using a reparameterization trick. What is this trick? I couldn\u2019t find a reference to it.\n- In the experiments, which time points are the left-out marginals? Are the left-out marginals in the future and need to be extrapolated? Or is it interpolated as in-between points? The former task seems to be a lot harder in my opinion.\n\n\nMinor comments:\n- I wish the authors expanded a bit more about the potential extension to the quantum Schr\u00f6dinger equation, since this is a field I am particularly interested in. The Madelung transformation in the appendix appears to only be for one particle (unless I am missing something) which is not really of practical relevance. The authors do not state this exactly and I wish they were more precise in how they view this extension in their appendix section. Extending classical densities of particles to work in the quantum setting for multiple particles is a tricky task as it needs to account for factors like entanglement; e.g. see density functional theory which takes on this complication in rather extensive detail. \n- The particular task in the experiment is tough to follow unless one goes into the appendix and digs into the details of the Kaggle competition itself. I wish the authors would describe more what exactly is going on. E.g. simple things like what the raw data is in the form of. The resulting task is the PCA of this raw data.  \n- As stated in my disclaimer above, I am by no means an expert in this topic, but I do not think this paper unifies the field. In fact, there were many situations where the authors stated to their credit that their method may not apply very well (e.g. Schrodinger equation). I am sure people would have to get a different perspective for these problems. So I would caution the authors in their language surrounding this point.\n\nOn a final point, given my lack of background, I did not check equations line by line and proofs were not checked.\n\nOverall, I have chosen a score of marginal accept for the reasons stated in my admittedly limited review above. My confidence is low in this score so I welcome thoughts from the authors and other reviewers."

Despite a stated lack of expertise, we appreciated your perspective.\n \n> they say (method) is effective and efficient in a wide variety of domains including transport with constraints and unbalanced transport... For example, the constraints.. are on the marginal values themselves. However, what if the constraints come in a different form, e.g. a symmetry in the problem or distributions? \n \nWe have been careful to only refer to 'marginal\u2019 constraints ('intermediate\u2019 or 'endpoint\u2019) throughout the paper.   Symmetry constraints are fascinating, but beyond the scope of this work.\n\n\n> we can only observe population statistics and we want to infer individual statistics from this\u2026 But looking at the experiments, none of the experiments test this specific point. All the experiments are predicting population statistics.\n\nWe agree that it would be interesting to test against ground truth individual trajectories.  Since this is not possible on real data, we constructed the leave-one-out experiments to test the quality of our marginal interpolations.  \n\n> Below eq 27, the authors say that they perform optimization with respect to $\\eta$ using a reparameterization trick. What is this trick? I couldn\u2019t find a reference to it.\n\nThe reparameterization trick refers to optimizing an expectation $E_{\\rho}[f]$ under $\\rho_t(x_t)$ by sampling some relevant stochasticity (here, $(x_0, x_1)$), parameterizing a transformation $x_t = g_\\eta(x_0,x_1,t)$, and taking gradients using the chain rule, we have\n\n$$\\frac{d}{d\\eta}E_{\\rho_t (x_{t})}\\left[f\\left(x_{t}\\right)\\right]=E_{\\rho_0\\left(x_{0}\\right)\\rho_1\\left(x_{1}\\right)}\\left[\\frac{\\partial x_{t}}{\\partial \\eta}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_{t}}\\right]$$\n\nFor more information, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder#Reparameterization\n\n> Are the left-out marginals in the future and need to be extrapolated? Or is it interpolated as in-between points?\n\nWe leave out one of the intermediate marginals each time we run our algorithm, and report the average W1 distance over runs.\n\n>The Madelung transformation in the appendix appears to only be for one particle\u2026 which is not of practical relevance.   The authors do not state this exactly\n\nThe Madelung transformation in the appendix can be extended to $n$ particles by concatenating their coordinates into the vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{dn}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the space, and introducing the corresponding symmetries (bosonic, fermionic) into the density and the vector field. The notorious challenges with the introduction of the symmetries, together with the fact that the Lagrangian becomes non-linear, suggest leaving the study of quantum systems beyond the scope of our paper.\n\n> The particular task in the experiment is tough to follow\u2026 e.g. simple things like what the raw data is in the form of. The resulting task is the PCA of this raw data.\n\nThank you for the suggestion.   However, due to space constraints, we deferred details to Appendix and referenced related literature.\n\n\n>  I do not think this paper unifies the field. In fact, there were many situations where the authors stated to their credit that their method may not apply very well (e.g. Schrodinger equation). I am sure people would have to get a different perspective for these problems. So I would caution the authors in their language surrounding this point.\n\nWe have tried to limit our use of 'unified\u2019 to refer to our computational approach for the 'linearizable\u2019 objectives in Sec. 3.2 and Eq. 17.   This level of generality is still notable, as many previous works have derived problem-specific methods which rely on additional assumptions or known structure in each setting.\n\nWe feel that the perspective of \u2018Lagrangian optimization on the density manifold\u2019 and our novel dual objective in Thm 1 can be insightful to understand (and make connections between) a diverse range of problem settings, even where our computational approach does not directly apply.   For example, solving problems with nonlinear Hamiltonians, our dual objective suggests maintaining both a sampler and a density model to parameterize $\\rho_t$."

Below, we emphasize the `distinguishing characteristics\u2019 of our approach and address other concerns.   \n\n> it is not clear what is the distinguishing characteristic of the proposed approach in relation to other works.\n\nOur approach provides a novel method for solving optimal transport and its variants.\n\nUsing a common parameterization and the objective in Eq. 17, our computational method applies to a diverse collection of \u2018linearizable\u2019 Lagrangians (Def 3.1).  Existing works often solve a single one of these problems (see Sec. 3.3) by leveraging known structure or particular assumptions (e.g. W2 OT solvers using ICNNs, Brenier Thm).\n\nOur main technical contribution is Proposition 1, which uses duality of tangent and cotangent space on the Wasserstein manifold to suggest computational objectives for solving Wasserstein Lagrangian Flows.\n\n> The paper does not provide sufficient evidence for the validity of their approach to solve all Lagranian type problems\n\nWe agree that our computational approach does not apply for *all* Lagrangians, but applies for   `linearizable\u2019 Lagrangians (defined in Sec. 3.2).   This includes W2 OT, physically constrained OT, OT with general Lagrangian costs, unbalanced OT, and entropic OT.\n\nWe provide evidence for the effectiveness of these methods for solving trajectory inference problems in Sec. 4 and the experiments in the general response.\n\n\n\n> Minimizing the Lagrangian may not be the appropriate objective in general, because Lagrangian flows are not the minimizer, but the extreme points of the action integral.\n\nOptimal transport is explicitly defined via cost- or kinetic-energy minimization, and the existence of minimizers is guaranteed, for example, in the Benamou-Brenier formulation of W2 OT.   While the action functional could have multiple critical points (some of which are not minima), we know that all minimizers are critical points (i.e. Lagrangian flows).   \n\n\n> There is not enough motivation for parametrizing the flow according to (26). For a standard OT problem, what is the optimal function that replaces the neural net in this equation?\n\nThank you for the suggestion!   In the general response, we have argued that our parameterization in Eq. 26 can universally approximate any absolutely-continuous distributional path.    We have also defined the optimal function which the neural network approximates.\n\n\n\n> Most of the background material can be moved to appendix as they are not critical to the proposed algorithm\n\nThank you for the feedback.   \nIn Sec. 2.2 and 2.3, we hope to introduce important concepts (kinetic energy, (co)tangent space) using familiar examples, before the more abstract and general presentation in Sec. 3.1-3.2.   \nWe will consider moving Sec. 2.1 to the appendix, where we give detailed consideration to OT with state-space Lagrangian costs (App. A.2.2)."

While the action functional could have multiple critical points (some of which are not minima), we know that all minimizers are critical points (i.e. Lagrangian flows).\n\nYou are right about optimal transport, because it only contains the Kinetic energy.  But in the paper, you present the Lagranigian as difference of \"Kinetic\" - \"potential\" energies, which I assume it is inspired by classical Lagrangian mechanics. My point was to say that in Lagrangian mechanics, we are interested in the stationary points of the action integral, not minimizers. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary-action_principle\n\n> we have argued that our parameterization in Eq. 26 can universally approximate any absolutely-continuous distributional path. \n\nThanks for your answer. I can now see how one can parameterize the optimal path in the way you did. But this representation does not seem very efficient as it requires a single neural net to represent a discontinuous function of x, and learning each of the potential functions \\phi_0 or \\phi_1 is difficult on their own."

My main concern with the paper (and perhaps the research area)\n   is that the quality of the solution to the OT/UOT/SB problems\n   is not directly measured or compared to other methods.\n   In other words, the objective values of the optimization\n   problem in (12) are never reported or compared between methods\n   that are solving that problem.\n   This is because solvers may solve the problem in different\n   forms, such as dual forms, where the value being optimized\n   is not comparable between methods.\n   Because of this difficulty, research in this space often\n   reports another diagnostic metric that is assumed to be\n   correlated with a better solution to equation (12).\n   In this paper, Table 1 reports the W1 distance to\n   the left-out marginals. While they indeed show that\n   WLF variants are often better than two other papers\n   published in 2023, it would be better if the field\n   had a more direct way of comparing solvers.\n2. If I understand correctly, the representational capacity of equation (20) not\n   clear or discussed. E.g., can it universally approximate distribution paths,\n   and it is obvious that it can capture an optimal transport path?\n   Experimentally it seems that it is the case, but it would be good to\n   present or discuss more intuition behind this family of paths.\n3. The experimental results are mostly focused on the\n   existing scRNA setting. While these are seemingly good,\n   it seems like the experimental settings considered\n   by the other [Lagrangian SB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04853)\n   and [generalized SB](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09893)\n   papers would be reasonable to compare against.\n   This would help better-quantify the approach as\n   a general-purpose solver for these large problem classes.\n4.

                        "value": "Thank you for your review.  In particular, we feel the suggestions regarding Lagrangian SB experiments and expressivity of parameterization will improve the paper.\n\n> 1. My main concern with the paper (and perhaps the research area) is that the quality of the solution to the OT/UOT/SB problems is not directly measured\n\nNote that in Table 1-2, we compare our WLF-OT to the exact OT solution.  However, we agree that evaluation metrics are difficult in this research area.   Among scRNA setups, our experimental setting was motivated by (i) testing our ability to achieve accurate *interpolation* between given marginals and (ii) demonstrating how one might explore various Lagrangians or inductive biases for approximating ground-truth dynamics for a given problem of interest.\n\n\n\n> 2.  representational capacity of equation (20) not clear or discussed. E.g., can it universally approximate distribution paths, and it is obvious that it can capture an optimal transport path?\n\nThank you for the suggestion!  In the general response, we have argued that our parameterization in Eq. 26 can universally approximate any absolutely-continuous distributional path (e.g. OT).   We will include a rigorous proof in the camera-ready.\n\n> 3. seems like the experimental settings considered by the other Lagrangian SB and generalized SB papers would be reasonable to compare against\n\nIn the general response, we have included results in the experimental setting of the Lagrangian SB paper (which is also scRNA, but is their only non-toy experiment).  All of our proposed methods perform comparably or better than the best baseline method.\n\n\n\n> 4. Appendix C.2 has some image generation experiments, but they seem incomplete\n\nThis is not a main focus of the work.   However, we note that exact OT requires the velocity vector field to be a gradient field, which is a more strict condition than alternative 1-step generation methods such as rectified flows.   In fact, exact OT methods have rarely been applied to high-dimensional settings such as images.    The generated images show that multi-step generation and one-step generations are nearly identical, which indicates satisfying the zero-acceleration condition."

To the best of my knowledge, the paper provides a reasonable methodological and experimental advancements for OT and single-cell trajectory modeling. I'm still hesitant that the experimental results do not directly measure the solution quality to the OT problems and are only on single-cell trajectory inference, but the experimental comparisons in the submission and response here seem reasonable and well-executed."

Optimal transport involves finding the most efficient way to transport one distribution into another, taking into account different geometric and potential energy considerations. Realizations of this framework include the Schr\u00f6dinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport, and optimal transport with physical constraints, among others.\nSolving the associated variational problems can be computationally challenging because the optimal density path is often unknown. However, the authors propose a dual formulation of the Lagrangians that leverages deep learning techniques to address these challenges. Importantly, their method does not require simulating or backpropagating through trajectories or accessing optimal couplings."

They seem to capture several of the frameworks discussed in this work and it is unclear in what sense you are providing a \"unifying framework\" here.\n\nBesides, the current experimental validation is incomplete. Some questions:\n\n1. I am surprised by the choices of baselines. Could the authors comment on why they only compared against Tong et al., 2023a and Tong et al., 2023b? There are several approaches that propose Schr\u00f6dinger bridges for modeling single-cell dynamics and beyond, in particular Shi et al. (2023), Somnath et al. (2023), Liu et al. (2023), and Chen et al. (2022) to name a few. Vargas et al. (2021) and Somnath et al. (2023) in particular contain single-cell experiments.\n\n2. It seems a bit odd not to compare against methods that also incorporate unbalanced solutions. Missing comparisons are here Eyring et al. (2022) and L\u00fcbeck et al. (2022) that propose neural unbalanced OT solvers. The most obvious comparison would be with Pariset et al. (2023) and Pooladian et al. (2023b), which you cite but do not compare against. Is there a reason why?\n\n3. What is the motivation of running the method on the first 5 principal components (Table 1) besides running on 50 and 100 PCs? Does the method not scale to larger problems? Usually, single-cell data is reduced to 50 to 100 PCs to capture most of the variance, 5 PCs are not enough.\n\n4. Why does the method barely outperform the exact OT method? For Table 2, why is exact OT even better on 50 and 100 PCS than the proposed method WLF-OT?\n\n5. Is there any reasoning when to use which version of the method? If you compare the three methods using the same number of neural network parameters, do the results change?\n\n6. In your conclusion you state: \"we studied the problem of trajectory inference in biological systems, and showed that we can integrate various priors into trajectory analysis while respecting the marginal constraints on the observed data, resulting in significant improvement in several benchmarks\". This is not what the results suggest in my opinion. The chosen datasets do not allow for a thorough study of cell death and birth and thus do not provide a framework that allows studying unbalanced formulations of OT. However, there are multiple datasets that contain screens of cancer drugs that induce cell death (see Srivatsan et al., 2020) as well as the datasets studied in Pariset et al. (2023), L\u00fcbeck et al. (2022), or Eyring et al. (2022) that would be more suitable.\n\n7. Minor, but a work connected to \"Optimal Transport with Lagrangian Cost\" to include is Fan et al.

                        "value": "We appreciate the knowledgeable and thorough review!   We have run two sets of new experiments to address the concern about additional baselines, and summarized our results in the general response (and soon in the new revision). We address the remaining concerns below.\n\n> highlight the conceptual differences between your method and Chow et al. (2020) as well as Carrillo et al. (2021)?\n\nComparison with Chow et al. (2020) was discussed in detail at the top of page 9 in the original submission.  Carrillo et al. (2021) is concerned with JKO-style discretizations of W2 gradient flows, which does not address endpoint-constrained problems such as optimal transport.\n\n\n> 1. several approaches that propose Schr\u00f6dinger bridges for modeling single-cell dynamics and beyond\n\nIn the general response, we have added comparison with additional SB baselines (Vargas et. al 2021, Chen et. al 2022 (FB-SDE), de Bortoli et. al 2022, along with Koshizuka et. al 2023 (Neural Lagrangian SB) and others).\n\n\n> 2. It seems a bit odd not to compare against methods that also incorporate unbalanced solutions\u2026 the most obvious comparison would be with Pariset et al. (2023) and Pooladian et al. (2023b), which you cite but do not compare against. Is there a reason why?\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have included the comparison with Pariset et al. (2023) in our general response. \n\nNote, Pooladian et. al 2023b is not an unbalanced transport method.  Their Sec. 5.1 considers physically-constrained OT, but only in two-dimensional experiments.   \n\n> 3. First 5 principal components (Table 1).  Does the method not scale to larger problems?\n\nWe demonstrate the scalability of our method in Table 2 in the original submission, showing results on 50 and 100 principal components for the Cite and Multi datasets.   As in the 5-d cases, our proposed approach achieves improvements over the baselines.\n\n\n\n> 4. Why does the method barely outperform the exact OT method? For Table 2, why is exact OT even better on 50 and 100 PCS than the proposed method WLF-OT?\n\n\n  WLF-OT and OT-CFM approximate the straight-path exact OT solution (which is not differentiable when transitioning between transportation plans) with a differentiable function.  This may lead to better performance in some cases, since the exact OT solution does not reflect the ground-truth dynamics of the cells in either Table 1 or 2. \n\nWe also note that the evaluation metric in this setting is the W1 distance rather than W2, in keeping with previous works on the subject (Tong et. al 2023a,b, Koshizuka et. al 2023).\n\n  \n\n\n\n> 5.  Is there any reasoning when to use which version of the method? \n\nOur goal was to emphasize throughout the paper (Introduction, first sentence of each Example in Sec. 3.3, Conclusion) that prior knowledge or inductive bias of the ground truth dynamics of the task should inform the choice of Lagrangian.\n\n> 5.  If you compare the three methods using the same number of neural network parameters, do the results change?\n\n\nThe results for our proposed WLF methods use MLPs with the same number of layers and neurons.\nFor baseline methods, the differences in architectures or number of parameters are insignificant from the perspective of the runtime. \n\n\n> 6. \"we studied the problem of trajectory inference in biological systems, and showed that we can integrate various priors into trajectory analysis while respecting the marginal constraints on the observed data, resulting in significant improvement in several benchmarks\". This is not what the results suggest in my opinion.  The chosen datasets do not allow for a thorough study of cell death and birth / unbalanced OT.\n\nWe believe this statement is supported by our exposition and results, and does not make specific claims about unbalanced OT or birth/death dynamics.   As requested, we have included an additional unbalanced OT experiment capturing birth/death dynamics in the general response."
