Specifically, the authors proposed an algorithm consists of three stage which separatively and iteratively learns features and classifier using alternative sampling and pseudo-labels. Experiments on two datasets verify effectiveness of the proposed algorithm."

To present a three-stage learning approach, the author integrates certain techniques from the previous long-tailed learning field and the semi-supervised learning field. Before the three stages of learning, the author, who refers to the previous methods, decouples feature embedding and classifier to initialize the model. Afterward, the model undergoes several rounds of learning, repeating the methods of these three stages in each round. In the first stage, the model generates pseudo labels on unlabeled data. In the second stage, the model uses both pseudo-label samples and labeled samples for training feature embedding. In the third stage, the model uses labeled samples to train the classifier. Among them, random sampling is used in the first and second stages, and class-balanced sampling is used in the third stage. This method is an extension of the decoupling method in the field of long-tailed learning on semi-supervised data, which helps to make model representation more generalized and classification more balanced. The author also demonstrated in the experiment the superior performance of such methods on extremely imbalanced data."
