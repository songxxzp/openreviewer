The paper is not sufficient in disassembling and verifying the advantages of the IM method, so it is recommended to focus on discussing in the ablation study of the experiment.\n2.The paper emphasizes the extensive enhancement of the IM for most existing RL algorithms, but the most recent description of the mainstream RL algorithms in related work is SAC in 2018. It's a bit of an overstatement and lacks a comparison of the latest work, especially non-pixel-based approaches to solving the data efficiency. \n3.The IM introduced in this paper will bring additional computing and storage overload, and whether there can be related ablation study to eliminate this part of interference.\n4.This paper emphasizes the advantages of solving high-dimensional state spaces and large-scale problems, but the continuous Mujoco task and discrete Gym task selected in the experimental part cannot represent the above problem scenarios. Meanwhile, the last paragraph on page 6 emphasizes model-free RL, which is inconsistent with the scope of limitations described in the full paper.\n5.The experiments in this paper lack the description of the structure of the method-dependent neural network and the hyperparameters setting."

The origin of this argument is not clear, and this paper does not prove the advantage of IM to solve this problem through experiments.\n2.The description of algorithm 1 is not clear and standardized, and it lacks relevant neural network. Intuitively, it seems that there is no update process of IM introduced network.\n3.In the last paragraph of the paper on page 8, the description of the experimental results of \u2018Pendulum\u2019 task, directly attributed to the limited state space, such a description is inadequate in the absence of similar experiments or evidence."

Otherwise the artificially created targets for the critic would be misleading and potentially will harm the learning performance. Given that I can't find information on how these networks are trained, I really doubt if these networks will be able to adapt quickly and generate meaningful targets. \n\n# Experiments\n\n## Domain\nGiven that the method is so simple and the paper is making such a big claim, I would expect evaluations in more domains. For example, since you are already evaluating the method in Acrobot and Lunar Lander, why not also Cart Pole? Also, Atari games have been used as a standard benchmark for DRL methods. I would strongly suggest to at least do experiments in a few of them.\n\n## Experimental details\nThere is no detail on the experiments at all. \nAt least, how are the hyperparameters tuned needs to be discussed to make sure of fair comparisons. \nImportant details about the implementation of the method and the architectures of the networks are also missing. \n\n## Comparison to other approaches that try to improve the sample efficiency of DRL methods\nSince this method focuses on improving the sample efficiency of DRL methods, I would also like to see comparisons to other approaches that try to do the same thing, to understand how effective it is."

The experiments on two Mujoco tasks (Halfcheetah, Ant) and three classic tasks (Pendulum, Acrobot, Lunar Lander) demonstrate that IM can improve over classic RL algorithms (SAC, PPO, DDPG, and DQN)."

                    "value": "1. Clarity and presentation issues. The manuscript lacks clarity in its presentation. For example, (1) Algorithm 1 not informative. It is just normal \"interact and update\" routines for RL with an additional call to \"update Critic by IM()\" with no referencing. (2) The description of the IM module would benefit from a formal presentation rather than the PyTorch-style code snippet provided in Listing 1. (3) Figure 4, which is merely a screenshot from TensorBoard based on a single seed, does not adequately represent the results. (4) The language and mathematical expressions used are not up to professional standards. For example, the term \"Promotion\" is  used to describe relative performance improvement in Table 1, which is not typical, and the mathematical formulas are employed in a vague and seemingly arbitrary manner in general.\n\n2. Insufficiency in experimental validation. (1) The authors do not compare with any baselines other than standard RL algorithms. The authors should at least compare their work with [1,2,3] which has similar analytical reasoning modules. (2) There are only two tasks from Mujoco (Halfcheetah and Ant) with three classical tasks (Pendulum, Acrobot, Lunar Lander), which is not sufficient to demonstrate the general applicability of the proposed method. (3) It would be better to plot the mean and std with careful plotting rather than screenshots of the tensorboard. \n\n3. The significance and soundnessof the proposed method are limited. There are a lot of  papers on using analogical reasoning modules to improve RL, e.g., [1,2,3], and the authors should definitely discuss and compare with them. Also, the critic $Q(s,a)$ and its value difference $d(s,a,s',a')$ are jointly learned in the IM, and it unclear why is that a meaningful objective.\n\nMinor: attention to formatting, particularly the use of spaces, is needed. Instances like \"replaybuffer\" and \"(4)Similarity\" in the last paragraph of page 4, among others, require correction for better readability.\n\n[1] Zhu G, Lin Z, Yang G, et al.
