Because of this, perhaps some of the gains over MLE can be attributed to randomness in training, rather than to inherent goodness of the method.\n* The results on real-world datasets (sections 5.3 and 5.4) are somewhat underwhelming. I see small gains (and perhaps small gains are a good result already given how simple the method is), but I'm also a little bit concerned whether these are interesting enough for practitioners to be excited and go back and implement/use this method. Overall, I feel like the paper lacks a big convincing results, such as  significant improvements to SOTA on a dataset that people care about.\n\nNote that I am not saying that the work is solid, it seems to be done reasonably well, I'm just not sure how much impact it will have on the community given the current empirical evidence."

SOTA methods for different tasks usually require task-specific handling (e.g., using bilingual pre-trained masked language models for translation [1], using contrastive learning between candidate summaries for summarization [4]), making them less generalizable. In contrast, our proposed approach **does not make such task-specific assumptions**, making it applicable to any text generation task to improve robustness.\n\nMoreover, **our gains are not limited to synthetic settings**: We would like to highlight that our method yields large improvements in language modeling (-1.58 Perplexity, Table 3), and in Appendix F, we show that our method improves upon the MLE baselines from +0.5 to 0.9 BLEU on Paracrawl MT data. To further address the reviewer\u2019s concerns, we added experiments to show that our method can be used in conjunction with SOTA task-specific methods [1, 4] to improve the performance:\n\n| IWSLT 14 De-En  | Test BLEU |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------|\n| BiBERT (Table 2 in [1])      | 37.58     |\n| BiBERT (reproduced) | 37.62     |\n| BiBERT + ENT-Fraction        | **38.29**    |\n\n| CNN/DM            | Rouge-1 | Rouge-2 | Rouge-L |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| BRIO (Table 2 in [4])   | 47.78   | 23.55   | 44.57   |\n| BRIO (reproduced) | 47.81   | 23.52   | 44.52   |\n| BRIO + ENT-Fraction  | **48.04**   | **23.61**   | **44.81**   |\n\nWe also conducted additional experiments in a more realistic setting: We use the Human+GPT mixture data in [5] and perform instruction tuning on LLama 2 7B. We show the results of adding ENT below:\n\n|                                   | MMLU (0-shot Acc.) | TyDiQA (F1) |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|-------------|\n| Llama2-7b instruct (Table 5 in [5])     | 49.2               | 52.8        |\n| LLama2-7b instruct (reproduced)   | 50.1               | 52.1        |\n| LLama2-7b instruct + ENT-Fraction | **51.3**               | **54.0**        |\n\n\n> How was the threshold hyperparameter tuned in all experiments in the experimental section?\n\nWe choose the best of {1.35, 1.38, 1.4} for ENT-Threshold in all our experiments. More details of how we tuned the hyper-parameters can be found in Appendix C.\n\n>  I was confused by the second equation in section 3, should it be a \"less-than\" sign rather than a \"greater-than\" sign?\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have made revisions to the manuscript (marked in blue).\n\n[1] BERT, mBERT, or BiBERT?

                        "value": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for the helpful and insightful comments. We appreciate that the reviewer acknowledges that our method is \u201csimple, effective and robust\u201d and our experiments are \u201cinsightful\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d. \n\nWe address the concerns and questions shared in the review:\n\n> The improvements over existing methods seem marginal in some experiments.\n\nWhile the improvements may seem marginal, we believe they are meaningful gains for the following reasons: \n\n1. **Our experimental setup gives a lot of advantage to our baselines:** The baseline results on opus-MT and CNN/DM have already been tuned extensively, and even the state-of-the-art truncation methods [1] can only yield, in your words, \u201cmarginal\u201d improvements (+0.58 Rouge-1 and +0.78 BLEU) with exhaustive hyper-parameter tuning (e.g. [1] performed a grid search of 12 combinations of their two hyper-parameters). On the contrary, our proposed approach shows consistent gains in MT (+0.5 BLEU averaged across all directions) with minimal hyper-parameter tuning. We show the number of hyper-parameter configurations we tuned in the following table:\n\n| Method         | Number of Hyper-parameters Tuned |\n|---------------------|----------------------------------|\n| TaiLr [1]           | 10                               |\n| Loss Truncation [2] | 3                                |\n| ENT-Threshold       | 3                                |\n| ENT-Fraction        | 1                                |\n\n2. **Consistent across different tasks and models:** In spite of the strong baselines, our method yields large improvements in language modeling (-1.58 Perplexity) and machine translation with noise injected (up to +2 BLEU) with no computational overhead. Our method also yields consistent gains on **multiple languages** in multilingual MT and on **two different models** on text summarization. In Appendix F, our method yields larger gains (+0.5 - 0.9 BLEU) on an unfiltered Machine Translation dataset (Paracrawl), \nshowing that our method yields larger gains in noisier settings.\n\n> In my opinion, all non-ground truth tokens are treated in the same way in the proposed method. can you explain?\n\nWe understand that there is a nuance in how we define \u201call non-ground truth tokens are treated in the same way\u201d.  We meant that existing methods ignore the predicted distribution over the non-ground truth tokens - therefore treating all probability distributions over the non-ground truth tokens as equal, whereas our method differentiates between when the predicted distribution over non-target tokens is skewed versus uniform. Empirically, we found compelling evidence that the error norm clearly distinguishes between clean and noisy tokens (Figure 4). Thank you for pointing this out, and we have made revisions to clarify our motivation in Section 2 (Marked in blue).\n\n> Following above, I think one potential improved version of the proposed method is to take into account the similarity between non-ground truth tokens and ground truth tokens when computing the l2 norm.\n\nYour point is well taken. We agree that a variant of our method that incorporates semantic similarity is an exciting future direction. However, one challenge is that the target and non-target token could be very similar and the data might still be an error (e.g., The capital of Maryland is Baltimore V.S. Annapolis). As also mentioned by Reviewer p8xo, Figure 4 provides compelling evidence that the error norm itself clearly distinguishes between clean and noisy data, therefore we opted to only use error norm for simplicity.\n\n[1] Tailoring Language Generation with Total Variation Distance (Ji et al., ICLR 2023)\n\n[2] Improved Natural Language Generation via Loss Truncation (Kang & Hashimoto, ACL 2020)"

                    "value": "- Even though the results have proven the effectiveness of ENT, I think the motivation of using error norm to estimate data quality can be further discussed and provide more insights about how do they correlate. \n - Theoretically, whether an example is helpful to train a model not only depends on the correctness of its label but also on the uncertainty (or entropy) of this example, according to the lessons from active learning. As uncertainty also takes into account of the prob of non-targets as ENT does. Therefore, it would be important to discuss the relationship between uncertainty and ENT in this paper.  \n- The proposed method achieves significant improvements on simulated training data with manually added noise (with two types of noise) but it only yields modest improvements on the standard benchmarks where training data may contain less noise. Therefore, it would be helpful if the proposed method works well on natuarally noisy benchmarks. Of course, it may be difficult to collect a large scale of training data and thus it is practical to apply the proposed method under the finetuning scenario, where a small scale of naturally noisy data is used for finetuning (for example, there is such a shared task in WMT).   \n\u000bp.s.

I did not find where explains these two terms.\n1.2 In Figure 6, what and how are the ENT threshold and ENT fraction set?\n2. The authors claim that previous work would rely on hyper-parameter tuning (on fraction or threshold). But the proposed ENT method also requires these hyper-parameters. I am not sure the proposed method would be more efficient on hyper-parameter selecting.\n3. In $5.2, apart from the two settings, another setting \"Over translated\" (noted by the authros in Figure 2) should also be included.\n4. In $5.4, it is inadequate to draw such a conclusion on using which method for pre-trained model and using which method for from-sractch model, with only a summarization task. More downstream tasks should be conducted to draw such a conclusion.\n5. Title of Section 4 could be re-considered to like \"Analysis\", as case studies always provide study on a few specific \"cases\" from the dataset. But this section is analyzing on the whole dataset. However, this is just a suggestion, and does not affect my rating."

This is interesting and also confusing, comparing to other ratio. Do you have any explain or study on this? Moreover, in real scenoria, I think the untranslated ratio in the dataset is not as large as more than 20%, so does this result suggest that under common situation, using MLE is enough to beat other modifications?\n2. In Table 2, the advantages of ENT and also the Loss Trunc. and TaiLr are not significant against MLE when ratio <=30%. Also in real scenoria, the misordered ratio might not be that high, which also raieses the same question as above."
