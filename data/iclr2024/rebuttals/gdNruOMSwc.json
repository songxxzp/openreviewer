To achieve this, the\nauthors utilized an established website accessibility evaluation tool to identify potential issues within the HTML code.\nThis process yielded a dataset containing the violations of 25 URLs. By leveraging OpenAI's GPT models and prompt\nengineering, the system automatically revised the HTML code, resulting in a notable decrease of the accessibility\nviolation errors."

The\nevaluation, although not particularly extensive, is transparent and traceable. Since the authors have provided the dataset\nand the code, it should be possible to reproduce the results to a certain extent. To enable future comparisons with other\nmethods, the resulting dataset should be made publicly available.\nThe authors have cleverly used existing components, such as OpenAI's GPT model, and creatively combined them to\nsolve an essential and socially relevant problem.\nThe approach certainly has potential and quality, but the paper needs some revision, as it does not seem quite mature in\nits current form."
                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Although the introduction effectively underscores the importance of enhancing and automating accessibility, it could benefit from a more comprehensive integration within the landscape of the really closely related work. While the authors touch on recent automatic and semi-automatic approaches, they just mention that there have also been studies that considered improving accuracy through semi-automatic techniques of manual correction and even a few automating this correction using prompt engineering (most related), without providing specific examples or literature. If the deployment of prompt engineering is something completly new in this context, the authors must either point this out more clearly or highlight the differences and advantages of their approach compared to the existing state of the art.\nRegarding the cited related work, it should also be noted that the mentioned automatic strategies mainly cover the generation of alternative text for images and in this context the insufficient quality of the automatic alt-text approach of facebook is pointed out. This aligns with the statement on page 1, that the most common issue in accessibility is the lack of text equivalents or alternate text for images, but is also incidental after it becomes apparent (page 7) that images cannot be processed at all by the system presented by the authors.\n\nWith regard to the proposed method, it is difficult to tell which components were pre-existing and which were developed by the authors, making the contribution not directly apparent. The presented approach does not seem to involve any fundamentally novel non-basic components, but its strength lies in the adept engineering and smart combination of existing components. This has certainly its own value when it is shown that an existing problem can be solved in new ways. Hence this is not really the issue.\nHowever, my main criticism is that there is no quantitative or qualitative comparison with existing methods.\nAs much as I appreciate the research in this area and recognize the need for automated methods, there is unfortunately no substantial evidence presented that the authors' method is in any way at least equivalent to existing approaches, or even superior to them.\nThe authors should try to compare with existing approaches, as the mere improvement over the initial situation is arguably not so meaningful.\nThis would be different, if their method uniquely addresses unresolved accessibility issues and a comparison might not be feasible or possible. However, it appears that this is not the case, or at least it is not evident and must be clearly pointed out and proven by facts.\nThe same applies to the authors' claim within the conclusion section that they have invented a new subfield of automated accessibility.\n\nOther weaknesses:\n- I don't see the necessity of the mathematical formulas in section 3.4. The expressions appear to artificially introduce complexity, making it more unnecessary challenging for the reader to comprehend. Rather than introducing variables with no subsequent significance, it would be more effective to use an illustration of the pipeline or at least pseudo code. Especially since the definitions lack clarity and precision, for instance, the term \"sub\" was used without prior explanation, and both the definition and the necessity of F_{HTML\\_fix}'s definition remain incomprehensible, raising doubts that it is mathematically well-defined. Furthermore, most of the variables are unnecessary for defining the terms of R and I. A clear verbal introduction would have sufficed and enhanced comprehension.\n- Section 5 is not really a discussion, but a summary. There is no critical examination present.\n\nMinor weaknesses:\n- The title is misleading. \"Deep Learning\" refers solely to the use of pretrained LLMs and not to the direct embedding of deep learning techniques.\n- In table 2 the space is missing in some cells of \"final / avg\".\n- Typo in Figure 4: \"messasges\"\n- Page 2 and 3 contain faulty links to literature\n- The figures/tables should be referenced in the main text to put them in context and improve readability by guiding the reader. Also, the context of some tables, such as Table 3 , is not discussed or mentioned in any way, so it is not clear what the reader is supposed to do with this information."

                    "value": "- Why is there no comparison to other existing methods?\n- Since missing alternate text for images is in general a key issue, how would approaches addressing alt-text, such as the\none of Facebook, perform on your data set? Even if the authors' method ignores images, this could help to assess the\noverall performance (assuming the URLs contain a realistic number of images).\n- How were the 25 URLs in the dataset selected? Which URLs were previously used by related work? Why weren't the\nsame ones used, or is there no information available?"

Notably, we emphasize the novelty of our approach by framing it as a tool for end users vs. companies or web developers, hence the difficulty in comparing our results to existing research.\n    * (Section 1) \u201cCurrently, no accessibility correction tool exists with the intent of serving users with a tool to correct web pages on the go. While the scope of previous studies was limited to addressing alt-text generation with computer vision, our tool can be used more ubiquitously and purposefully by web users to handle web accessibility violations when desired.\u201d\n* > *no quantitative or qualitative comparison to existing methods*\n>\n    * throughout the paper, we have updated the introduction, results, discussion, and conclusion to better incorporate references to existing work and to support the novelty of our work as a tool that can enable users to make websites more accessible as and when needed. To our knowledge, existing methods like ours (employing prompt engineering for automated text-based corrections accessible to users) are not in existence or feasible to compare to\n* math: the purpose of introducing mathematical expressions in section 3.4 is to provide a precise and formal representation of our approach. However, we understand the concern about the potential complexity for the reader. Before introducing the term \u201csub,\u201d we clarify that \u201cwe substitute the incorrect HTML tag with the correction generated.\u201d This explanation logically leads the reader to understand that \u201csub\u201d serves to substitute an incorrect HTML for the correction. Our goal is to enable readers to grasp the intricacies of our approach without unnecessary complexity. Given the presence of Figure 5 and 6, which illustrate the correction pipeline with visuals, we believe that the combination of figures and mathematical expressions strike a balance between formality and accessibility in understanding. \n\n* > *Section 5 is not really a discussion, but a summary.* \n>\nThe discussion has been updated to include more critical examination of the impact of our research and its significance within a real-world context. (Section 5) \u201cTo our knowledge, existing approaches for correcting accessibility violations do not automate the correction process using prompt engineering techniques in a way that can be easily adapted as a tool for users.\u201d\n* missing spaces in Table 2 have been corrected, typo in Figure 4 corrected, citations have been corrected\n* all figures and tables are referenced in the main text and further discussed to explain their relevance in the context\n     * (Section 4) \u201cAs detailed in Table 4, the model demonstrated strong proficiency in addressing text-based web accessibility issues, achieving 100\\% success rates in correcting violations of landmark-no-duplicate-content, label, skip-link, and ARIA-required-attribute\u201d\n* >dataset should be made publicly available\n> \nThe dataset is publicly available through GitHub.\n* > *Why is there no comparison to other existing methods?*\n>\nThe absence of comparison to existing methods stems from the fact that there are currently no known benchmarks or papers that attempt to do exactly what we are doing, namely employing prompt engineering to correct accessibility violations in an efficient manner. As a result, there is no means to determine whether we are beating the state of the art. Instead of seeing our research as a tool to help developers quickly build accessible tools, we have reframed the practical use case of our approach to be something that an end user can use (e.g. via a Chrome extension) that automatically makes webpages accessible. This therefore avoids a comparison with humans in terms of accuracy when fixing the DOM. \n    * highlight: (Section 6) \u201cSuch automated violation correction methods could be adapted into a web-based tool or extension to enable users to correct accessibility violations of websites when needed.\u201d"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their insightful questions and for appreciating our clear discussion of prompting techniques and models. \n\nIn this comment, we respond to the reviewer\u2019s questions and outline key changes made to the pdf. \n\n>*1) What types of websites were used: dynamic or static? Were there React apps or similar apps? OR Would this approach work for React or similar apps?*\n>\nThe types of websites used for our benchmark were all dynamic. For example, we included websites such as New York Times, Audible, and Google Calendar. However, the websites were fed through Playwright based on their state at the time of dataset creation. \n\nIn the new PDF, we listed some example websites in our dataset in Section 2.1 (\u201cSome example websites included were Google Calendar, Slack, Audible, BBC, Quora, New York Times, and ResearchGate.\u201d)\n\nThere were some websites that were built using React, including Collegeboard, SoundCloud, Vimeo, BBC, Eventbrite, GrubHub, New York Times, Patreon, and ResearchGate. This approach worked for these websites, and they were able to correct several of their violations.\n\n>*2) Were there any perfect web pages? If yes, what did the proposed model do in that case?*\n>\nThere were no web pages within our dataset that had zero accessibility errors. This is due to the fact that when run through Playwright, a web page without any violation errors would not return any results and therefore could not fill up dataset columns. However, based on some tests conducted during our research, if a web page has zero violations, the LLM may return a \u201ccorrection\u201d that results in the same initial HTML tag (and thus if the replacement process were applied using the LLM\u2019s response, there would be no change in the DOM).\n\n>*3) What was the maximum number of violations observed?*\n>\nIn our dataset, the maximum number of violations initially observed was 13. It is likely that this number could be much larger if we expanded our dataset to include more URLs.\n\n>*5) How many system and user messages were generated?*\n> \nEach violation generated one system message and one user message. So since we had 171 total rows in our dataset, 171 system messages and 171 user messages were generated. \n\n>*6) Can you explain the process that was used to generate the \u201csuggested change\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d in the User Message? Were these done manually, and if so, how did the team decide the best phrasing for the suggested changes?*\n>\nThe \u201csuggested change\u201d and \u201cincorrect\u201d information in the user message was extracted from the dataset. The \u201cincorrect\u201d comes from the \u201chtml\u201d column of the dataset and \u201csuggested change\u201d comes from the \u201chelp\u201d column of the dataset. This information was returned by Playwright for each website and formatted into our dataset to be used for the user messages.\n\n**Changes made to the pdf** \n* References have been corrected and updated\n* Table 2 reference in Section 4 has been updated as \u201ctable 2\u201d\n* Section 4 includes a brief definition of ARIA: \u201cARIA, or Accessible Rich Internet Applications, is a suite of attributes and roles designed to enhance the semantic value of web elements and complex interfaces, particularly for assistive technologies, by conveying states, properties, and roles beyond what's inherently available in HTML.\u201d\n* Typos in Fig 4 have been updated. This is an example of a system message and user message that would be fed into the models.\n* Section 3.3 has been updated to include more detail on the process of generating the prompts. \u201cWe generated the system and user messages by accessing specific columns of the dataset for each error and formatting the information through prompt engineering (see Figure 4 for an example).\u201d\n\nOverall, we reframed our approach to be more of a tool for individual end users, instead of for web developers or companies. As a result, a comparison to existing methods is unfeasible, but the ability to decrease accessibility violations is notable for serving users with impairments."
