                    "value": "The paper is interested in generating an adversarial patch, i.e., a small patch placed in a scene that changes the prediction of a neural network. The paper introduces an approach based on optimal transport to generate a patch, such that the estimated feature distribution of corrupted source images becomes close to the distribution of features from the target class, using either the Wasserstein and Sliced-Wasserstein distance. The black-box transferability of the attack is compared to state-of-the-art attacks for the Image Classification task on ImageNet-1K, on a broad set of networks. Qualitative results with a printed patch are also presented to demonstrate the real-world applicability of the attack."

This large coverage is important, as it shows the adaptability and effectiveness of the proposed attack across diverse neural network architectures. Furthermore, as mentioned in the paper, recent networks and training recipes are both naturally more robust than older CNNs, it is then fundamental to evaluate against them as well. From the results, we can see that attacks optimized for a specific category of models does not transfer as efficiently to all other categories.\n- **High Transferability Results:** The proposed approach demonstrates strong transferability results, outperforming in general both state-of-the-art patch and non-patch attacks. Notably, the approach accomplishes this while maintaining a similar level of computational efficiency as other existing methods.\n- **Clarity and Reproducibility:** The paper is well written and easy to follow, with a clear description of the proposed approach and of the experiments. Additionally, the code is available as supplementary material which helps reproducibility."

This means that the attack has access to a lot more information compared to attacks that matches a single feature point. This data dependency could be an important limitation in practice."

Please find bellow our response. \n\n> Concerning the data dependency to construct the target class distribution. \n\nTo generate patches, we split the validation set of ImageNet into a training set on which we train patches and into a test set on which we evaluate them. To model the target class distribution, we select images from targeted class included in training set of ImageNet dataset (composed in practice by at most 1300 images). In this regard, we agree with the reviewer that our method has more information than single feature point method, but this information is available as the model was trained on it. In Figure 9 in Appendix we show the evolution of the transferability of out attack with respect to the number of points used to model the target class distribution. As been shown, the targeted success rate (tSuc) increases with the number of considered target points. This figure is added to the supplementary material in the ablation study section. Thank you for pointing out this interesting experiment."

                        "value": "Thanks to the authors for their answer and taking the time for the additional experiments. However, there are two comments I would like to make from the response.\n- First, I'm not totally satisfied with the presentation of the results. As such, it is difficult to compare with other APA, since the setting is slightly different from the tables presented and the results are averaged over all networks. I would like to see where results with other APA would land on Figure 9, when compared in the same setting, to have an idea of the number of target points required to reach better results. It makes sense that the more points to estimate the distribution, the better, but what would be a good number of data points ?\n- I do not fully agree that \"this information is available as the model was trained on it\". If an attacker were to create a patch to disrupt a model deployed in production, they would not have access to the training data of the model. Then, the attacker would need a thousand images of the target class to estimate the target feature distribution and create their patch using the proposed approach, whereas they would need a single image of the target class for feature-point based attacks. This remark does not invalidate the strength of the attack, but rather provides an explanation of the strong success rate observed, and it is a practical limitation not mentioned in the paper."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the response. Please find bellow our responses.\n -   We appreciate the feedback concerning Figure 9. To compare exactly in the same setting and to enhance the clarity of Figure 9, we add three additional runners-up baselines (GAP, LaVAN and TTP), and the supplementary material is updated correspondingly.  \nConsidering a larger number of targeted data points smooths the patch optimization and reduces the performance variability of the obtained patch (this result joins the results presented in Appendix B). We agree with the reviewer that a larger number of data points leads to a better estimation of the target class distribution and then to stronger patches. Figure 9 shows that considering ten target points significantly increases the patch transferability. However, the attacker may prefer to consider a larger set of target points for statistical soundness.\n-    We agree with the reviewer that the targeted model is unknown, and the dataset on which the targeted model was trained is also generally unknown. In our previous response, we were referring to the training data of the source model. We followed the common practice of transferability works where the attacker may use images from the training set of the source model to build the corresponding method (L2-based method, TTP and M3D). However, we agree with the reviewer that our method uses more information than the feature-point-based method. This limitation is added in the supplementary material in the paragraph discussing Figure 9.\nThank you for the interesting discussion."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for this comment, as it helps us to better clarify the contribution of our paper. To best of our knowledge, the proposed approach is the first attempt to use distribution based approach in the feature map and to show its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. To give more theoretical results, in Appendix C we give a proof on why our method generalizes the L2-based method. Our method may outperforms other decision boundary based methods as they tend to create a patch that overfits on the source model decision boundaries. \n\n\n> Concerning the superiority of optimal transport based loss over the Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n\nThis point has been addressed in the general response (see first point in general response).\n\n> About converting generative methods into iterative universal ones. \n\nWe convert generative methods into iterative universal methods since the objective of patches is to create one universal patch capable of fooling networks without knowing the scene where it may be placed. We thank the reviewer for providing new baselines to compare against. We convert [1], which is an image specific iterative method, into an iterative universal method. We add these new results in Table 2 of the main article. The proposed method in our paper, shows the better performances (obtained mean tSuc of 22.56\\% and 7.55\\% by our and [1] methods respectively). The approach proposed in [2] suggests a new data augmentation approach which is interesting. In our paper, our main contribution is based on proposition of a new loss function without considering any model independent strategy like data augmentation. In future works, we will consider to use this new data augmentation that may enhance our attack.\n\n| Method   |  min | mean | max\n| ----------- | ----------- |  ----------- |  ----------- |\n| Logit  Zhao et al.

Formally the estimated target distribution is $\\hat \\nu_y^{(l)}  = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{j=1}^m \\delta_{f^{(l)}(x_j)}$ where each $x_j$ are images of the targeted class $y$.

Instead of forcing corrupted image representations to cross the nearest decision boundaries or converge to a particular point, this paper proposes a distribution-oriented approach and relies on optimal transport to push the feature distribution of attacked images towards an already modeled distribution. This work shows that the proposed new distribution-oriented approach can lead to better transferable patches."

                    "value": "1. This work introduces a new framework based on optimal transport for creating patch attacks that are highly transferable to unknown networks. This framework is based on the idea of attacking feature distributions, which is less model-dependent than relying on decision boundaries and more robust to optimization artifacts than the feature point method.\n2. This work shows that the proposed attack works for the most extensive spectrum of deep networks considered in the patch attack literature, such as various versions of Convolutional Neural Networks, Transformers, and adversarially trained models. The proposed method also shows transferability superiority through extensive experiments."

                    "value": "1. For qualitative experiments, this paper gives some results by selecting three objects present in ImageNet-1K (banana, cup, keyboard) and recording videos of them when one patch is placed or not next to the object. Yet, the performance of model in the physical world may be affected by the different angles or intensities of light. Thus, it would be more meaningful if this paper could provide the performances of the proposed approach with the change of angles or lights for the qualitative evaluation.\n2. For digital experiments, the authors select from the previously defined families the following models and measure the attacking transferability when the resulting patch is used to fool the remaining models. The results show that the proposed approach can generate the stronger patch attack than its counterparts. Yet, the visual perception to human vision should also be considered. It would be more convincing if the image with the generated adversarial patch with the proposed method and its counterparts can be evaluated with the PSNR or SSIM as the evaluation metrics for the degree of recognition for human vision.\n3. According to the table of computation time in the Appendix of this work, the proposed approach with sliced version SW and the normal W can achieve comparable efficiency with the previous methods. Note that the computation of optimal transport may need more time than those methods without OT, the authors may explain why the approach with OT to generate the adversarial patch can achieve the efficiency without the drop of performance."

                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback on introducing a new framework and on large scale experiments.\n\n> Concerning providing additional experiments on the robustness of patches according to physical conditions. \n\nWe have investigated the robustness of our produced patches against physical transformations. We have detailed this point in the general response (see point 2 in general response). Table 6 and Figure 7 in Appendix H show the results. Our patches transfer even in the worst-case scenario (far from the camera or when rotated), while other patches do not.\n\n> About the visual perception of patches to human vision. \n\nPSNR and SSIM metrics are commonly used to measure the potential detectability of perturbations induced by invisible adversarial examples. Adversarial Patch Attacks (APAs) rely on adding a visible textured patch to the scene: metrics such as PSNR and SSIM are not adequate in this context, because they would produce high values when comparing clean and attacked images. We want to emphasize that the purposes of invisible adversarial examples and adversarial patch attacks are different: APAs do not attempt to be made invisible by humans, as they consist of a strong image modification with a limited spatial extent. They are potentially detectable by humans as an object or region in an image but are expected to fool a deep neural-network and to be physically realizable.\n\n> Regarding the computational time of our methods. \n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the exact optimal transport solved by linear programs is known to be very slow. As said in the main article, this method scales with the considered number of samples and in our case this number is low. The number of samples for source distribution ($\\mu$) is $n=50$ and for the target distribution ($\\nu_y$) is $m=1300$. It explains why our method does not show numerical overflow compared to other methods. \n\n> On providing more details and explanations on why our method outperforms other methods.\n\nIn Appendix C, we provide a proof to show that our method generalizes the L2-based method. In the main article we try to provide some insights on why our method outperforms decision boundary based methods. Our method may outperforms other decision boundary based methods as they tend to create a patch that overfits on the source model decision boundaries."

I believe that the method's use of Wasserstein and its variants as a loss metric is a straightforward application of existing techniques. Additionally, the usage of EOT and TV Loss is common. Thus, I'm concerned that the technical contribution of this paper might be too weak for ICLR.\n\nThe experimental results lack discussions and explanations: For instance, why is it that in the experiments, the Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) always underperforms compared to the Wasserstein ones (W)? What causes this? I'm concerned about whether the settings for the two proposed methods are fair. Moreover, I believe there needs to be a more comprehensive ablation study and explanation regarding the choice of target layers. The authors only investigated the impact of the last three feature layers. Why did adding J-2 significantly affect performance?\n\nPhysical experiments are somewhat weak: I believe this paper fails to demonstrate the superiority of its method in physical experiments, especially since the author claims that the method provides better transferability but only compares it to a weaker baseline (L2). Additionally, could you investigate the robustness of your method when facing physical transformations? For instance, under variations in camera angles and distances."

                        "value": "Thank you for the feedback. Glad to hear that you find our idea innovative. Here are replies to points in order. \n\n> Limited technical contribution. \n\nUsing an optimal transport-based loss may be straightforward, but to the best of our knowledge and considering the literature review on transferability, the proposed method is the first to generalize feature-point-based loss. To strengthen the theoretical aspect of our contribution, we give in Appendix C the proof that the exact Wasserstein loss generalizes the L2-based method. \n\n> About the different behavior and results between the Sliced-Wasserstein distance and the exact Wasserstein distance. \n\nThe Sliced-Wasserstein distance and the exact Wasserstein distance are two different distances. The first is based on one-dimensional projections and the second on cost and coupling matrices. The comparison of these two methods behavior in high dimensional spaces is an active mathematical field of research and exceeds the contribution of this paper. One of the reasons that the exact Wasserstein outperforms the Sliced-Wasserstein could be that the projections in non-informative directions bias the gradient calculated using the Sliced-Wasserstein distance. In fact, the encoder is learned to build non-correlated variables to classify images. Hence, few directions retain useful information for discrimination of the target class. This induces some bias in the gradient of Sliced-Wasserstein loss, which may cause the patch to fall into a poor local minimum consequently. However is this paper, we want to emphasis that our contribution is to show that distribution based loss has several advantages over other methods and in practice may outperforms them. \n\n> Concerning the comparison setting between the two Wasserstein distances. \n\nWe try to make the comparison between the two Wasserstein distances as fair as possible. In the main article and in the supplementary material, we evaluate the performance of each method for a broad scale of different hyper-parameters. For example, in the supplementary material, we evaluate the performance of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance according to multiple number of random projections $K$ alongside its other hyper-parameters. \n\n> About the choice of the target layers. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for the careful reading of the paper. We have encountered that there is a typo in the text. $l_{J-2}$ and $l_{J-1}$ correspond in fact to $l_{J-8}$ and $l_{J-2}$ respectively. These layers represent the second and the third block of Swin models, which is composed by four blocks in total (see Figure 8 in Appendix I). This experiment shows that the last layers outperforms from pushing mid layers distributions. \n\n> Only comparing against the L2 method during the physical evaluation.\n\nDuring our physical experiments, as said in the main article (see Section 4.3), we compare against all the baselines. However, the L2-based method and our methods are the only to show significant transferability. Hence, for the brevity, we have shown only their corresponding results. To make it more clear, we have rewritten the corresponding sentence.  We have investigated the robustness of our produced patches against physical transformations. Table 6 and Figure 7 in Appendix H show the results. Our patches transfer even in the worst-case scenario (far from the camera or when rotated), while other patches do not."

Moreover, we want to emphasize that even if the exact and the sliced optimal transport are based on optimal transport, they have different behaviors. The sliced OT relies on one-dimensional projections and the exact OT on a cost and coupling matrix. Theses differences are noticeable in high-dimension space, like the feature space of networks.
