                        "value": "Thank you for your appreciation of the comprehensive analysis of the performance and safety attributes of LLMs with varying architectures.  \n\nWe are providing an end-to-end ML framework to construct KGs from the EMR notes. It includes several steps as presented in the 4th section:\n1. Preprocessing\n2. Disease-specific notes identification\n3. Prompt design, which is provided under section 4.4, where we show that we use a systematic and task-agnostic process to construct prompts as outlined in Jimenez Gutierrez et al. (2022). \n4. Question design, the questions are categorized into three types: treatment-related,\nfactor-related, and coexists with related questions.\n5. Relation extraction\n6. Postprocessing\n\nTo evaluate the LLMs, we needed to review all EMR notes and extract all factors, treatments, and coexisting terms. The evaluation is based on precision and recall, with the ground truth for comparison being the entity values available in the notes. The precision and recall we calculate provide an evaluation of the whole framework, thus the KG, not only the QA system. With these metrics, we can compare the relations our framework gives as an output to the ones extracted by medical practitioners.  We had a total of 360,000 EMR notes. To avoid excessive time consumption, we chose to conduct the final analysis only on notes related to one disease (age-related macula degeneration), thereby annotating only age-related macula degeneration notes. In the results section, we provide precision and recall results for all LLMs, besides some of the decoder-only models, with which it was not possible to get structured output essential for the KG. Thus we give separate analyses for those decoder-only models. Afterward, we concentrated on qualitative analysis in the last part of the results section comparing the results with the relations extracted by the SemMedDB, which is a repository of semantic predictions extracted from the titles and abstracts of all PubMed citations. \n\nAnswers to the questions\n\n1) The dataset we used is a real-world EMR notes provided by the Macula & Retina Institute. You can find some examples in the Appendix section. The decision to use this dataset was to ensure that none of the LLMs have been trained or fine-tuned on it, ensuring a fair comparison. At the end of the \"Related Work\" section, we describe why this dataset poses greater challenges compared to those in other papers. Thank you for the suggestion, we will consider using a public dataset for the evaluation of our method in future versions of our papers, but also before that we should ensure that none of the models have been trained/or fine-tuned on that. \n\n2) You can find about the evaluation of the KG in the aforementioned text. \n\n3) We are providing an evaluation of the KG construction process both quantitatively and qualitatively, but also give some examples of the prompt results in the Appendix to show how the prompt design works qualitatively. \n\n4) You can find the KG construction process under the 4th section.\n\n5) Yes, prompts impact the KG construction process as can be visible in Table 2. The results are different by using 0-shot, few-shot, instruction-based, and our demonstrated \"guided\" prompt."

This study is mainly related to an assessment work for different LLMs; however, authors only evaluate the precision and recall on three medical entities in Tab. 5 (I think it should be Tab.2) besides demonstrating some cases to prove their observations. It would be better to discuss different evaluations for different LLMs, such as reasons of hallucination, accuracy and evidence to extracted triplets, and so on.\n3. In Tab.2, there have no explicit results to show the effectiveness of guide instruction-based prompting. It would be better to show the performance of \u201cVicuna-33B w/o guide, Llama-2-70B w/o guide and WizardLM-70B w/o guide\u201d.\n4. Why do not evaluate GPT-4?

Nevertheless, I still would like to discuss some questions with the author.\n1. I think the \u201cQualitative Example: AMD\u201d you mentioned here is an application discussion rather than an accuracy analysis. I think the accuracy discussion should face to the triplet extraction. For example, show the precent of LLMs in extracting a totally correct triplet. From Tab.2 in your manuscript, I cannot gain the performance of LLMs in extracting a KG triplet, i.e., (head entity, relation, tail entity) or (head entity, tail entity, relation), although you may have done this work.\n2. I agree with your opinion in LLM\u2019s hallucination. But I also think we can give readers a possible analysis in a specific question. For example, maybe the inputs of LLM are confusion when we don\u2019t use the instruction-prompt, etc.\n3. Your response about my question in performance of guide instruction-based prompting is clear. However, I still believe it would be better to add a suitable ablation experiment on guide instruction-based prompting, because the results of Coexists with in Tab.2 are not better than encoder-decoder LLMs.\n4. As I know, we can use Azure OpenAI now, so that we can test our data based on the ChatGPT\u2019s API.\nI am very looking forward to your study in automatic knowledge graph construction."

                        "value": "Thanks a lot for the comprehensive analysis of our paper.  We appreciate your suggestions. Here are the answers to the questions:\n\n1. The correlation between the performance assessment outlined in Table 2 and triple extraction results are following:\n\nEach column in the table corresponds to a specific relation type, such as 'treatment.' Precision represented as 95%, and recall, represented as 90%, indicate that, within the specified method, the model successfully extracts 90% of triplets (head entity, relation = treatment, tail entity) from the available data, and 95% of these extracted triplets are accurate.  The ground truth for comparison is the triplets available in the notes. All the available triplets have been extracted by medical practitioners manually. \nAdditionally, reconstructing the Knowledge Graph (KG) is facilitated by connecting head entities to tail entities using the corresponding relation edges.\n\nThis structured methodology allows for logical inferences on the KG. For example, if entity A treats entity B, and B is a factor for C, one can infer that A treats C as well. The \"Qualitative Example: AMD\" section presents all extracted triplets where the tail entity is AMD. Entities highlighted in red within the table signify inaccuracies in the triplets (head entity = red-colored entity, relation, tail entity = AMD), while an orange-colored triplet indicates the model's failure to extract a triplet present in the data (clinical notes). \n\n2. We have faced such things during the design of our proposed \"guided\" instruction-based prompting.  I agree with your opinion, we will add the evolution of the prompt from standard to our design and give an analysis of what may cause confusion of the LLM to hallucinate. \n\n3. The success metric for us when evaluating \"guided\" prompt design was not to achieve better results than encoder-decoder results, but to make decoder-only models to give enough structured outputs which is essential for relation extraction. Our hypothesis is that with finetuning on health-related data and with our prompt design they may perform much better. But for now, they have at least started to give responses at some structured level, thus pushing the performance of some of the decoder-only models from 0's to the numbers available in Table 2. Your suggestion on ablation studies is definitely valuable and we will consider it adding to our next version of the paper. \n\n4. We have evaluated ChatGPT for the KG construction for AMD, it gave a very small number of relations compared to our results by using the clinical notes. We will add a comparison with ChatGPT to our paper. \n\nI hope my answers are helpful to better understand our approach. Please let us know if you have additional comments or suggestions."

Examples include:\n- The citations used in the paper are in the wrong format.\n- In sections 3.1 and 4.1, there is a non-existent reference to `\"Section ?0.8\".\n- The section cross-references are not in a unified format. Some examples include \"Section A\", \"Appendix Appendix D\", \"4.1\", \"Appendix subsubsection E.2.1\".\n- There is a \"Table 4.2\" in section 4.2. And \"Table 5\" in section 5 should actually refer to Table 2.\n- The authors use past tense and present tense alternatively throughout the paper.\n- There is a typo \"Knowdledge\" in the first paragraph of the introduction.\n- In Algorithm 2, the symbol between \"similarity_score\" and \"threshold\" is not correctly shown.\n- In section 4.6, the authors represent disease and the set of diseases as  $d$ and $D$. However, in section 4.1, they are referred as $c_{input}$ and $C$, respectively.\n- In section 4.6, the authors \"average over multiple occurrences of the relation of the type $t$ between $e$ and $d$.\" However, I believe the variable $e$ is never introduced in the paper.\n\n2. It is unclear how the constructed knowledge graph is evaluated. The authors only mention that \"the evaluation is done based on precision and recall\", but the process of the evaluation is not addressed. What are the ground truth labels here?\n\n3. In section 4.1, the authors mention using the BioBERT NER model to extract a list of diseases. However, an evaluation of its accuracy is missing. It's possible that the NER model could introduce some erroneous information or ignore any essential diseases.\n\n4. In section 4.1, it is said that \"If the similarity is above some threshold, we add the result to the result list.\" Here, the authors should explicitly mention the exact value of the threshold and discuss how it is determined.\n\n5. In the right part of Figure 1, it is unclear which sentences are inputs and which sentences are LLM responses. For example, the paragraph \"If the question is not related to the context, ...\" is within the \"###Response\" block, but it seems to be an input instead.\n\n6. For the prompt designs, it would be better for the authors to discuss the reasons why they have such designs and why these designs could help.\n\n7. In section 4.6, it is inappropriate to say that \"The numbers are chosen arbitrarily and they may be tuned for a dataset.\" The authors should study the effect of these hyperparameters and justify how they are chosen in the experiments to enhance reproducibility. Similarly, in section 4.7, the authors should also discuss why the threshold of the similarity score is set to 0.8."

For instruction-based prompting, we follow a systematic and task-agnostic process to construct prompts as outlined in Jimenez Gutierrez et al. (2022). As depicted in the left examples in Figure 1, this method identifies three key components of a prompt: overall task instructions, a sentence introduction, and a retrieval message. Building upon this, we introduce guided instruction-based prompting, denoted as 'guided' in the forthcoming sections. This refined prompt structure incorporates three fundamental elements:\n\na) Contextual Task Instruction: This aspect furnishes explicit and comprehensive guidance, emphasizing the model's role in extracting information solely from the provided context. It establishes a clear framework for understanding the task at hand.\n\nb) Input Format Guidance: To mitigate issues of relations extracted out of context, we introduced explicit instructions on how the model should interpret and process input. This includes specifying the acceptable types and formats for questions and contexts.\n\nc) Output Format Guidance: We refined the retrieval message to include the entity type and explicitly instruct the model on the desired format for its responses. \n\n7. We agree. Addressed in the latest version. \n\n8. Thank you. We have given a more detailed description in the paper. Here is the summary: \n\na) Open-Book QA: In this approach, the context serves as a specific, external information source from which the model is expected to extract answers to the posed questions. The context is typically a passage, document, or a set of information separate from the model's pre-existing knowledge. The model's task is to directly reference and pull information from this provided context to respond to the query. Thus, the context in open-book QA acts as a discrete reference material that the model consults to find answers.\n\nb) In-Context Learning: While in-context learning also involves a question and a context, the usage and purpose of the context differ significantly. Here, the context is not an external source of information but an integral part of the model's prompt. It includes a series of input-output pairs that serve as examples to guide the model in understanding the nature of the task. These examples demonstrate how to process and respond to similar queries. Therefore, the context in in-context learning is instructional and part of the learning material embedded within the prompt, guiding the model's response generation process based on demonstrated patterns, rather than serving as a source from which to extract direct answers.\n\nIn summary, while both approaches use a combination of questions and context, the role of the context in open-book QA is as an external reference source, whereas in in-context learning, it is an intrinsic part of the learning prompt, providing instructional examples rather than factual content for direct query response.\n\n9) Acknowledgements are removed in the latest version. \n\nWe appreciate for such a detailed analysis of our paper.

These methods include the following:\n  1. https://openreview.net/forum?id=ntIq8Wm79G-\n  2. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.04676.pdf\n  3. A number of papers from this list: https://github.com/zjukg/KG-LLM-Papers\n\n## What is this paper's contribution?\n  1. This paper releases a set of prompts that can help future researchers produce methods that automatically construct knowledge graphs given prompt-based LLM systems of various kinds.\n  2. They also perform an evaluation of the efficacy of building KGs from text leveraging a variety of LLM architectures.\n\n## How do these methods compare to prior works?\n  1. There is insufficient comparison with prior works to say here. This is a major weakness of the work."

You fail to sufficiently contextualize your advancement in the significant body of related literature in this space. There are a number of papers that complete or otherwise generate knowledge graphs via LLMs, and you don't reference or compare to these at all.\n  2. You don't state that you plan to actually release the constructed knowledge graph. This seems a major limitation when such a graph would be a resource to the community, were it extracted in a meaningful way. While this may be because you are actually constructin per-patient KGs (and if so then this should be a minor weakness, not a key weakness) that is not sufficiently clearly stated in the text to alleviate this concern.\n  3. If your KG is not patient specific, but is instead intended to capture general biomedical knowledge, it is not clear why using clinical point-of-care notes (as opposed to the clinical scientific literature) is the appropriate information source to use. Wouldn't scientific text be more accurate for capturing general information? If you are intending to capture per-patient information, why? For what will such information be used, and why should that be captured via unstructured clinical notes rather than structured information? These things need to be explained.\n  4. Ultimately, the biggest weakness other than the lack of comparison to prior art is that this is likely just not well aligned with this venue. You do not have any significant methodological novelty here, and that is a key focus for ICLR. This is also not about representation learning, or really method development within ML at all, but is rather an (albeit important) application within NLP for health and biomedicine. Perhaps re-submitting to a venue more targeted to NLP contributions and applications (such as ACL, or possibly even better, EMNLP) would be more appropriate (though if the AC disagrees about the suitability I will of course retract this concern).\n\n## Minor Weaknesses (things I dislike, but wouldn't sway me on their own)"

They experiment with different LLM structures - encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder. They introduce guided instruction-based prompting to interact with LLMs."

The evaluation is based on precision and recall, with the ground truth for comparison being the entity values available in the notes. We had a total of 360,000 EMR notes. To avoid excessive time consumption, we chose to conduct the final analysis only on notes related to one disease (age-related macula degeneration), thereby annotating only age-related macula degeneration notes.\n\nOne of the main contributions of our paper, besides presenting an end-to-end method leveraging LLMs for the automatic construction of KGs, is an extensive evaluation of the performance of 12 LLMs of various architectures specifically tailored for clinical relation extraction.\nThe dataset we used is a real-world EMR notes provided by the Macula & Retina Institute. You can find some examples in the Appendix section. The decision to use this dataset was to ensure that none of the LLMs have been trained or fine-tuned on it, ensuring a fair comparison. At the end of the \"Related Work\" section, we describe why this dataset poses greater challenges compared to those in other papers."
