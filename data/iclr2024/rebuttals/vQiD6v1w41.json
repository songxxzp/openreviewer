                    "value": "The paper presents a new framework for semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) that establishes an upper bound on target error. This framework introduces a method called Joint Error-based Triplet Alignment (JTA), which performs alignments not only between the labeled source domain and the unlabeled target domain but also between the labeled source domain and the labeled target domain. As a result, their empirical studies demonstrate that JTA can reduce domain gaps and enhance feature learning by explicitly considering the alignment for the labeled target data. The paper also introduces a dissimilarity metric known as Maximum Cross Margin Discrepancy (MCMD) to bridge the gap between theory and algorithm, ensuring the consistency of the target error bound. The main problem of this paper is the lack of sufficient details to understand and follow their motivation and derivation. Given the promising empirical results presented in the paper, I strongly recommend that the authors consider a complete rewrite of the paper, focusing on delivering a clear and well-motivated presentation. This should involve providing comprehensive derivations with sufficient details or citations, ensuring that each step of each equation is transparently explained for the benefit of the reader's understanding."

                    "value": "1. I find the paper's motivation unclear. To be specific, the upper bound of the hypothesis regarding the unlabeled target domain should be the most crucial starting point for readers to comprehend what the proposed method aims to address. However, the lack of an explanation for the proof of Equation (1) makes it extremely difficult for me to grasp and follow. Concerning D.1, I am unsure how the first equation of the unlabeled target error bound was derived. If it stems from Ben David's theorem (assuming my recollection is accurate, Ben David did not derive any error bound under semi-supervised settings) or the work of others, it would be beneficial to provide citations so that readers can fully contextualize and understand the subject matter.\n\n2. What is the source of the intractability, particularly for f_{S} and f_{V}? Given that both S and V are fully labeled, it seems reasonable to assume that a straightforward optimization approach like empirical risk minimization (ERM) could yield a reasonable approximation for f_{S} and f_{V). The mention of intractability is often made within the framework of variational inference, where certain integrations cannot be feasibly solved. Providing a clear explanation of this intractability would significantly enhance the paper's motivation.\n\n3. How is the reduction of the error term achieved between two fixed true labeling functions? I want to emphasize that \"true\" here means unchanging or fixed. The paper is proving a complex upper bound derivation, and its clarity is hindered by inconsistent definitions throughout, making it difficult to follow.\n\n4. The t-SNE visualization, without any indications of the class labels for each data sample, fails to convey meaningful information. In fact, I find the t-SNE visualization rather perplexing. I recommend that the authors consider sharing the code for their implementation with the reviewers. This would serve not only to confirm the reproducibility of their work but also to enhance the reviewers' understanding of the proposed methodology.\n\n5. The experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly in the context of semi-supervised domain adaptation, where the number of labeled target samples and the way to select the labeled target sample are crucial. It is important to provide sufficient details regarding the sample selection process. \n\n6. The authors assert that [1] violates the triangle inequality without providing a thorough explanation or derivation. This is a strong claim, as it implies [1] is a departure from well-established theoretical foundations, especially considering that [1] is published on a top tire. To support their claim, the authors should conduct in-depth elaboration and studies.\n\n### Reference\n\n[1] Yuchen Zhang, Tianle Liu, Mingsheng Long, and Michael Jordan.

                    "value": "1. Could you please clarify what is meant by the conditional distribution referred to in Section 3.1? To be specific, which random variables are conditioned on which other random variables? Based on the authors\u2019 preliminary at the beginning of the section that both f_{S} and f_{V} are true labeling functions (true means fixed and deterministic). Meanwhile, I am confused by the idea of describing a mapping function (mapping function is normally deterministic) as a distribution (sampling from a distribution is stochastic). How come a stochastic term can be used to describe a deterministic notation? Can you elaborate on this?\n\n2. To me, the loss introduced in this work appears to be an extension of the one (MDD) presented in [1] to the semi-supervised setting. I would appreciate it if the authors could offer a comprehensive discussion outlining the primary distinctions between [1] and their proposed approach, excluding the consideration of the semi-supervised setting and the violation of the triangle inequality. \n\n### Reference\n\n[1] Yuchen Zhang, Tianle Liu, Mingsheng Long, and Michael Jordan.
