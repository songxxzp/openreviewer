                    "value": "The paper makes substantial use of the Polyak stepsize, a well-known technique in optimization for determining the learning rate based on the function values and gradients. The paper provides an example demonstrating how local adaptivity using Polyak stepsizes can improve convergence in optimization problems. It illustrates a scenario where the use of locally adaptive distributed Gradient Descent with Polyak stepsizes results in a near-constant iteration complexity, which is significantly better than using mini-batch Gradient Descent with a constant stepsize. The paper also delves into the convergence analysis on strongly convex functions. The algorithm is designed to be fully locally adaptive, catering to the needs of each client function in the federated learning setting."

The connection to the Polyak stepsize and the rationale behind the specific choices of (\\gamma_1) and (\\gamma_2) in Example 1 could be clarified by referring to the definition in Loizou et al. 2021. \n\n2. The choice of a noise standard deviation (sd) of 10 in Figure 1's caption requires clarification, especially given the observation that SPS does not seem to converge. \n\n3. The paper should provide a clear definition of ( f^* ) in Eq. 5, addressing whether it refers to the global minimum of the finite sum or average sum of each f_i. They are essentially different. \n\n4. It would be very hard to parse the sentence that \\sigma_f^2 is stronger than (zeta_*, sigma_*) but weaker than (zeta, sigma), and it is very hard to connect that to the inequalities in Proposition 1. \n\n5. The paper addressed the apparent need for hyperparameter tuning in both convex and non-convex experiments for FedSPS, especially given the gap between the worst and best performance from FedSPS and the gap from FedAMS, two of which are very comparable. FedAMS shows better performance in the experiments. So I don't see the remarkable improvement via the proposed method.\n\n6. The paper claims to compare the proposed methods with FedADAM, but this comparison is not present in the paper.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their evaluation of our manuscript. We did our best to understand and respond to their constructive criticisms, and provide detailed answers below:\n\n- (W1) For convex and strongly convex functions (such as the ones in Example 1), the optimal local stepsizes can be calculated using the Polyak stepsize (PS). For the above example, we have $f_1(x) = \\frac{a}{2}x^2$ and corresponding $\\gamma_1^\\star = \\frac{\\frac{a}{2}x_0^2 - 0}{\\left(ax_0\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2a}$. Similarly, $f_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$ and corresponding $\\gamma_2^\\star = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}x_0^2 - 0}{\\left(x_0\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since this analytical Example considers deterministic gradient descent (GD), we use the deterministic version of the Polyak stepsizie. For Figure 1, we consider the stochastic scenario (SGD) and hence use the SPS stepsize from Loizou et al., 2021.\n- (W2) For Figure 1, SPS does converge. We had set an extremely small threshold error ($\\epsilon = 10^{-6}$), beyond which we stop the algorithm. SPS achieves the desired error faster than the rest of the methods, as is obvious from Figure 1. The choice of $\\sigma = 10$ to introduce stochasticity is arbitrary, and should not change the observation. Nevertheless, we would add some additional plots for different values of $\\sigma$ in our potential camera-ready version, for the sake of completeness.\n- (W3) $f^{\\star}$ has been defined in the Introduction section at Equation (1), and refers to the global minimum of the finite sum. In the same paragraph, we also clarify that the global minimum $x^{\\star}$ and the local minima $x_i^{\\star}$ can be different. \n- (W4) Proposition 1 makes it clear that $\\sigma_f$ is a stronger assumption than ($\\zeta_{\\star}, \\sigma_{\\star}$). This is because any existing convergence rate for FedAvg using ($\\zeta_{\\star}, \\sigma_{\\star}$), will also hold for $\\sigma_f$ due to Proposition 1. Moreover, it should also be obvious that uniformly bounded noise ($\\zeta, \\sigma$) is a stronger assumption than bounded noise at optimum ($\\zeta_{\\star}, \\sigma_{\\star}$). We would try to rephrase this comment in the more understandable way in our revised version.  \n- (W5) We would like to kindly draw the reviewer\u2019s attention to the non convex experiments (Figures 4 and 5), where our proposed FedSPS in fact performs better than FedAMS.\n- (W6) We do compare our method to FedADAM as claimed in our manuscript, and refer the reviewer to Figure 3(c). For the other experiments we chose to include the comparison to only FedAMS for the sake of brevity, since FedAMS [1] was already shown to empirically beat FedADAM [2]. Nonetheless, we will make sure to add the comparison to FedADAM in the remaining plots for the potential camera-ready version of our paper, to aid better understanding.\n- (Q1) Please refer to the response to (W1) above.\n- (Q2) Please refer to the response to (W2) above.\n\n\nWe believe that all the questions raised by reviewer e5wf have been satisfactorily answered in our response above. We shall take care to incorporate the clarifications and changes outlined above in the potential camera-ready version of our paper. If you feel there are no serious flaws in the theoretical claims kindly consider increasing the \"Soundness\" score.

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. Algorithm design: in my understanding, FedSPS is mainly an FL version of SPS [Loizou et al., 2021]. This extension is rather standard and the algorithmic novelty is not particularly strong.\n\n2. Theory: the theoretical analysis combines the techniques of SPS with standard FL convergence proof, and only studied convex loss functions. Many results in the paper require a very small learning rate upper bound $\\gamma_b$ (typically for non-iid clients which is common in FL), which significantly limits the 'adaptivity' of FedSPS and the proposed method becomes FedAvg approximately.\n\n3. Experiments: \n\n(1) The presented numerical results do not fully justify the benefit of Polyak learning rates, and some results need more justification. In Figure 2(b), when $\\gamma_b=1$, the stepsizes are around 0.87 and very stable through iterations. It never reached 1. That means we are using the Polyak stepsize all the time. As a result, $\\gamma_b=5$ should give exactly the same training trajectory as $\\gamma_b=1$, right? This is because neither of them trigger the upper bound $\\gamma_b$. But in the figure, they are very different.\n\n(2) Also, from Figure 2(a), $\\gamma_b=1$ performs the best. From 2(b), the effective stepsizes of $\\gamma_b=1$ is very stable. To a large extent, I would say that this is almost a constant learning rate without adaptivity. In contrast, $\\gamma_b=5$ really brings adaptive stepsizes because the y-axis jumps a lot through iterations. So it is not very clear to me how 'adaptivity' helps the FL training. \n\n(3) In Figure 4(b), why does FedAdam perform so poorly (almost diverging)? Non-iid MNIST is a standard setting and an easy task. In the original paper of FedAdam and FedAMS there are also MNIST experiments and their methods performed well. This result does not seem very plausible.\n\n2. While the paper claimed that FedSPS needs little parameter tuning, I don't think this necessarily holds in practice. For adaptive optimization based methods (with Adam-type updates), in most cases the default $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$ and $\\epsilon$ values already achieve very promising performance, so for FedAdam or LocalAMS we essentially only need to tune the global and local learning rates. Furthermore, in fact, usually setting the global learning rate to 1 performs well. And for FedSPS, if we want, we can also add a global learning rate to (slightly) improve the performance. Moreover, The variant FedDecSPS has two tuning parameters, $\\gamma_b$ and $c$.\n\nTherefore, in general, I think the proposed method would require the same amount of parameter tuning as other adaptive FL methods."

                    "value": "Questions and suggestions:\n\n1. The proposed method is called adaptive FL, but it is different from the commonly noted adaptive methods (e.g., Adam, AMSGrad, etc.) which uses first and second order momentums. FedSPS is more like FedSGD with adaptive stepsizes. For better clarity on the contributions, I suggest that the title could follow [Stochastic Polyak Step-size for SGD: An Adaptive Learning Rate for Fast Convergence, AISTATS 2021] and include 'Polyak Step-size' and 'SGD'.\n\n2. How does your analysis extend to the partial participation setting? I suggest adding a brief statement on this for clarity. For FedAdam,\n[Analysis of Error Feedback in Federated Non-convex Optimization with Biased Compression: Fast Convergence and Partial Participation, ICML 2023] might be a relevant but missing reference.\n\nI general, I think this is a borderline paper and more justification is needed. I will be happy to raise the score if my questions are answered well."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their very thorough evaluation of our manuscript, positive remarks, as well as constructive criticism. We provide detailed answers to the concerns below:\n- (W1) **Algorithm:** As explained in Remark 2, we experimented with various other algorithm design choices for incorporating SPS in FedAvg, such as FedSPS-Global and FedSPS-Normalized which are more complicated than our proposed FedSPS but did not offer any empirical benefits---hence our choice.\n- (W2) **Theory:** The primary theoretical challenge in analysis of FedSPS was extending the error-feedback framework (that originally works for equal stepsizes) to work for fully un-coordinated local stepsizes, and we did this for the first time in our work.\n- (W3) **Experiments:** Following are detailed answers to questions about experiments:\n  - We beg to say the comment by the reviewer is a misinterpretation of what has been plotted in Figure 2(b). The plots do not show the SPS stepsize but a different statistic (SPS averaged both across clients and across the local steps). Therefore, it is possible that some client reaches the upper bound $\\gamma_b$ in some local step---hence the difference in trajectories plotted in Figure 2(b). \n  - The purpose of Figure 2(b) was to show that adaptivity sets in from $\\gamma_b = 1$, even if it is stable. Moreover, the purpose of Figure 2(a) was to show that all values of $\\gamma_b$ leads to convergence of FedSPS, while that is not the case for FedAvg. So, our method is less sensitive to $\\gamma_b$ than FedAvg is to $\\gamma$. \n  - We are aware that in Figure 3(b), FedAMS shows a diverging behavior for non-i.i.d MNIST, but this is the plot obtained from our experiments. Note that the original paper on FedAMS [1] does not show any plot for non-i.i.d. data, and the original paper on FedADAM [2] has experiments for the EMNIST dataset and not MNIST. Nonetheless, we will verify this particular experiment regarding its correctness, for the potential camera-ready version.\n  - We wished to convey that our proposed method has lesser dependence on problem dependent parameters than previous adaptive federated methods, and its sensitivity to the parameters involved is lower. We agree with the reviewer in this regard, and shall rephrase Remark 4 to clarify this in the revised version of our manuscript.\n- (Q1) The term \"adaptive methods\" has a wide variety of connotations in the optimization literature: one of the earliest successful adaptive methods was AdaGrad, which is essentially just a stepsize. Adaptive methods can but do not necessarily have to involve gradient history and momentum. We chose our title to cater to the broader message that local adaptivity can be useful for Federated Learning. \n- (Q2) Our proof is based on error feedback analysis, and we can use similar ideas from followup work [3, 4] considering partial participation to extend our convergence analysis to partial client participation setting. However, this seems non-trivial and might be a direction for future work. We shall add a brief statement regarding this, as well as the suggested reference in our potential camera-ready version.\n\n**References:**\n- [1] Wang, Yujia, Lu Lin, and Jinghui Chen. \"Communication-efficient adaptive federated learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

Please add a clarification, and/or consider adding a figure of the learning rate at individual clients to better demonstrate the benefit of adaptivity. \n\nFor the experiments, I do think that there is an issue with the MNIST results, since it is basically the most standard dataset in the FL literature. It does not make much sense that FedAdam would perform well on EMNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR, etc., but diverge on MNIST.\n\nMy question on the benefit of adaptivity in the experiments is resolved (please revise the figures and descriptions). Overall I think the quality of the paper is slightly above the threshold, and I will increase my score to 6. However, the issue in the experiments may suggest that the algorithms and baselines are not properly impelmented and compared."

The theoretical analysis to the heterogeneity is not convincing. $\\sigma_f^2$ is used as a measure of client heterogeneity in the paper, however, it is just an upper-bound (Proposition 1) of some more classical measure of heterogeneity, which means the proposed measure is weaker. In fact, if $l^*$ is chosen to be 0 (as in the paper), this measure is irrelevant to the heterogeneity.\n3. Comparison with more baselines are desired. Although authors claim that \"We design the first fully locally adaptive method for federated learning called FedSPS\", there are already some local adaptive methods for FL, such as the  Local-AMSGrad method cited by the authors. It is desirable to add some comparison with these methods."

Moreover, the primary theoretical challenge in analysis of FedSPS was extending the error-feedback framework (that originally works for equal stepsizes) to work for fully un-coordinated local stepsizes, and we did this for the first time in our work.\n- (W2) It is indeed true that the notion of optimal objective difference $\\sigma_f^2$ is a weaker notion of heterogeneity than the standard ones in Federated Learning (FL). However, one can note that such a quantity appears naturally in the analysis of SPS-type methods, and the purpose of our Proposition 1 was to show that $\\sigma_f^2$ is comparable to the standard heterogeneity assumptions in FL.\n- (W3) The existing algorithms for client-side adaptivity, such as Local-AdaAlter and Local-AMSGrad perform some form of aggregation of stepsizes during the communication round. Therefore, for these algorithms all the clients use the same stepsize for a particular round, and these methods are not fully locally adaptive as ours. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that an empirical comparison with these methods would add value to the paper, and will include them in our potential camera-ready version.\n\nWe believe that all the questions raised by reviewer g1co have been satisfactorily answered in our response above.
