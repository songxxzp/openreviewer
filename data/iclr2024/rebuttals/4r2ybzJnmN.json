                    "value": "As far as we know, the plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. However, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. In this manuscript, the authors propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation (i.e., offline manner). Then, the kernels contain only a few non-zero weights \u2013 one per synapse \u2013 whose positions correspond to the delays. Thus, these positions are learned together with the weights using the dilated convolution with learnable spacings (DCLS). The authors show us in a practical way that building deep SNNs can learn together with fixed delays and weights."

This is an important problem that has been addressed regularly in recent years, and the paper provides a novel and simple solution based on a temporal convolution parameterized by a certain precision. The delays are learned using a variant of the surrogate gradient method, and numerical simulations demonstrate the learning of delays by this method. Experimental results show very good performance on traditional community datasets (in particular, a top score in the leaderboard for the Spiking Heidelberg dataset) and also demonstrate a certain robustness of the method when certain connections are pruned."

                        "value": "The authors would like to sincerely thank the reviewer ybas for the high quality of his review. Below we respond to the other questions and remarks made by the reviewer:\n\n### Response to Weaknesses\n\n> The paper's connections with related works are satisfactory; however, it could benefit from presenting neuroscientific evidence on the plasticity of neural delays in biology. Additionally, it lacks a discussion on the relationship between the model's parameters and those observed in biology. For instance, the maximum delays utilized are around 250 milliseconds (300 milliseconds for SSC), while delays used in Izhikevitch's polychronization model are around 20 milliseconds. Furthermore, the paper does not establish any predictions made by the model that can be experimentally observed in biology.\n\nA1: About delay plasticity in the brain, we cite Bowers 2017, which reviews all the experimental evidence. We do not have the space to review it here, and we think it would be only marginally interesting for the ICLR audience, which is more interested in ML than in neuroscience. For the same reasons, we think that making predictions testable in neuroscience experiments is not required. About the range of delays, we agree that our maximal delays (250-300ms) are longer than what is seen in the brain. Again, this is not a problem for a ML contribution. But if you want to know our opinion, we think that in the brain, many layers are used for sound recognition, so the differences between the fastest path and the longest one across the series of layers accumulate and may reach several hundreds of ms in the end. Here we used only 2 or 3 hidden layers, so the range of delays for each layer had to be unrealistically large.\n\n\n\n\n### Response to Questions\n\n> Q1: What is the influence of the meta-parameters on the obtained performance? The influence of the characteristic time of the membrane potential would be interesting to study, as it corresponds to a kind of regularization of spike precision.\n\nA2: We agree with this remark, delays and the characteristic time of the membrane potential are very intertwined. Unfortunately, we didn't study thoroughly their relationship in this first work. We want to note that we tried to use learnable membrane potential time constants but it led to slightly worse performance.\n\n\n> Q2: Could you comment on the fact that \"We found that a LIF with quasi-instantaneous leak \u03c4 = 10.05 (since \u2206t = 10) is better than using a Heaviside function for SHD.\"? Would such a difference matter in biology?\n\nA3: We were also surprised by this experimental result which occurs only on the SHD dataset, we would argue that this difference is only due to numerical reasons and it won't matter in biology. \nFurthermore, we think that since SHD has some examples with lower timesteps compared to SSC/GSC, at the early phases of training when the standard deviation of the delay kernel is high. Delays and membrane potential retention could be redundant and counterproductive.\n\n\n> Q3: Concerning \"We used a one-cycle learning rate scheduler (Smith & Topin, 2018) for the weights and cosine annealing (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017) without restarts for the delays learning rates. \": Could you comment on your choice of learning rate schedulers? Would different schedulers significantly alter our results? Or does it just improve learning speed?\n\nA4: The one-cycle learning rate scheduler seems to work better in general for ML applications with SNNs from our experience. However, the cosine annealing without restarts for delays was specifically chosen due to the standard deviation decreasing strategy we use. Thus, the learning rate is high for the first part of the training when the standard deviation is large and delays can be learned easily, and in the second half of the training, the learning rate is low for delays when the standard deviation is small (see figure 4).\n\n\n\n> Minor\n\nWe thank the reviewer greatly for his constructive remarks and feedback. \nwe have corrected all the mentioned points, thanks again for your precision!"

Specifically, the significance, novelty, potential impact, and experimental validation are limited to the narrow field of SNNs themselves. Very rarely does an SNN paper show its advantages in the broader literature on neural networks, let alone in the real world. The present manuscript too, when evaluated in a broader scope, suffers from the same issues.\n\nMore concretely:\n- the method is only new for SNNs, but not for neural networks in general.\n- the performance is claimed to surpass the state of the art (already in the abstract), but the authors do not actually compare with the true state of the art, including non-spiking networks.\n- there is no experimental comparison with standard (i.e. less constrained) temporal convolutions.\n\nTherefore, it is unclear what the true contribution of the work is, beyond a nice conceptual analogy between temporal convolutions and synaptic delays.\n\n\nSecondary weaknesses:\n- Even within spiking networks, the work does not seem to surpass the state of the art, contrary to the authors' claims. In [1], a partly spiking neural network reached 95.6% on the GSC v0.02, where the authors report 95.35% at most. The manuscript does not cite that prior work.\n- The paper does not motivate sufficiently the choice of spiking neurons as a model. A paragraph explaining the advantages of SNNs *in comparison with the true state of the art, i.e. ANNs*, supported with citations that demonstrate them measurably, such as energy efficiency, but also rarely in other metrics such as speed of inference and training [1] and even classification accuracy [2]. Any other arguments and citations that the authors can add to support that choice would be useful.\n- The authors claim that there is no recurrency in their models, but a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron's leak membrane potential is equivalent to a self-recurrent connection. I understand what the authors mean, but, again in the spirit of appealing to the broader ICLR community and not only to the SNN niche, this should be clarified.\n\n[1] Jeffares et al., Spike-inspired rank coding for fast and accurate recurrent neural networks, ICLR 2022\n[2] Moraitis et al., Optimality of short-term synaptic plasticity in modelling certain dynamic environments, arXiv 2021"

                        "value": "The authors thank the reviewer sQsE for his review. The main concern of the reviewer is that our paper is mainly interesting for the SNN community. Yet, as the reviewer acknowledges, the SNN community is growing (and supra-linearly see https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.adi1480 Fig 28 in Supplementary Material, which plots the number of published SNN papers in top AI conferences, including ICLR). There is enthusiasm because, even if the SNN accuracy does not match (yet?) the one of ANNs, their implementation on neuromorphic chips could be much more power efficient than ANNs on GPUs. Several papers have argued why already. In our opinion, every SNN paper cannot and should not repeat all the arguments.\n\nIn addition, some labs and companies have already invested massively to design spiking neuromorphic chips. These actors are not so much interested in the ANN SOTA because they cannot implement ANNs on their chips anyway. But they will be interested in our paper because most of these chips have programmable delays (e.g., Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth, Spinnaker, SENECA), and thus could easily implement the SNN we propose for inference.\n\nMore generally, we believe that it is up to the Area Chair and the ICLR conference board to decide whether or not SNN papers are welcome at the conference. More explicitly, if our paper is out of scope, then it should have been desk rejected from the beginning. However, this was not the case: the article was not desk rejected. Instead, it was reviewed and received good feedback from half the reviewers. Rejecting the article solely on the basis that the sQsE reviewer is not an SNN enthusiast would be unfair. \n\nBelow we respond to the other questions and remarks made by the reviewer: \n\n\n> W1: there is no experimental comparison with standard (i.e. less constrained) temporal convolutions.\n\nA1: We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion! We ran experiments by replacing the DCLS convolutions with standard dense ones, this corresponds conceptually to having a fully connected SNN with all possible delay values as multiple synaptic connections between every pair of neurons in successive layers. This heavy parametrization led to slightly worse accuracy (due to overfitting) than our baseline model while having extensively more parameters. We added these results to Table 2 in section 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n> W2: Even within spiking networks, the work does not seem to surpass the state of the art, contrary to the authors' claims. In [1], a partly spiking neural network reached 95.6\\% on the GSC v0.02, where the authors report 95.35\\% at most. The manuscript does not cite that prior work.\n\nA2: To the best of our knowledge we achieve state-of-the-art SNN accuracy on SHD, SSC and GSC (PapersWithCode confirms for SHD and SSC: https://paperswithcode.com/sota/audio-classification-on-shd https://paperswithcode.com/sota/audio-classification-on-ssc). [1] reports results on the easier keyword spotting task on GSC v0.02, which considers only 11 classes, while we use the harder task of 35 classes. This is the reason we didn't add it to the result table even though it is an SNN, because it is not the same task.\n\n\n\n> W3: The paper does not motivate sufficiently the choice of spiking neurons as a model. A paragraph explaining the advantages of SNNs in comparison with the true state of the art, i.e. ANNs, supported with citations that demonstrate them measurably, such as energy efficiency, but also rarely in other metrics such as speed of inference and training [1] and even classification accuracy [2]. Any other arguments and citations that the authors can add to support that choice would be useful.\n\n\n\nA3: As explained in the \"general answer to all reviewers\", there exist many works that specifically focus on measuring energy efficiency and inference speed in comparison to non-spiking ANNs, but it's out of the scope of our paper. \n\n\n\n> W4: The authors claim that there is no recurrency in their models, but a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron's leak membrane potential is equivalent to a self-recurrent connection. I understand what the authors mean, but, again in the spirit of appealing to the broader ICLR community and not only to the SNN niche, this should be clarified.\n\nA4: The reviewer is right. We now say in the manuscript that we don't have recurrent connections *apart from the one of the LIF*."

                        "value": "The authors thank the reviewer Wbur for his review. The following is a response to the questions and remarks made by the reviewer: \n\n\n### Response to Weaknesses\n\n> W1: The novel contribution of this paper over the DCLS paper is not clear. Is it just the evaluation on multiple tasks? It is very important to clarify this aspect.\n\nA1: As we explained in the \"general answer to all reviewers\", the idea of modeling fully connected SNNs with delays using temporal convolutions and learning jointly the weights and delays doesn't come trivially from the DCLS paper (Khalfaoui et al 2023), which presents a general method for n-dimensional convolutions and used primarily for the spatial domain. Following this remark we modified the last part of the Introduction to explain it better.\n\n\n\n> W2: The comparison of the model with delays versus no-delays in Sec. 4.3 may not be completely fair: Using more layers (with same number of parameters) for the no-delay network seems more comparable.\n\nA2: Following this remark, we ran new experiments for the no-delays SNN, using more layers while remaining at the same number of parameters by decreasing the number of hidden neurons in each layer, the results for these runs are grouped in the table below, we also added them to the figure 5 in section 4.3. \n\n| Model             | SHD        | SSC     |\n| :---              |:----:      | :----:  |\n| 2 Layers          | 62.45\\%    | 56.47\\% |\n| 3 Layers          | 66.62\\%    | 59.18\\% |\n| ================= | =======    | ======= |\n| 2 Layers - sparse | 51.87\\%    | 30.29\\% |\n| 3 Layers - sparse | 46.75\\%    | 23.95\\% |\n\n\nIn the non-sparse case, adding more layers improves the performance by approximately 4\\% for both datasets. While in the case of sparse synaptic connections, it actually makes the performance much worse, due to the fact that the effect of sparsity is more important when having less hidden neurons. In general, the main claims of the ablation section remain the same.\n\nMost importantly, both networks do much worse than the SNNs with delays. So the conclusion of the paper is unchanged.\n\n\n\n> W3: The statement of \"Here we show for the first time that delays can be learned together with the weights, using backpropagation, in arbitrarily deep SNNs.\" is not true. (Shrestha & Orchard 2018) do exactly that.\n\nA3: Following this important remark, this claim was removed from the paper. What we meant is that we were the first ones not to use a finite element approximation to calculate the gradient of the delay (as explained in section 2.2). However, (Shrestha & Orchard 2018) can do that too with the condition of using an SRM neuron model.\n\n\n\n\n\n> W4: Some of the related work are incorrectly cited or not cited\n\n\nA4: Following this important remark we cited all the missing works. And especially for (Shrestha & Orchard 2018), the explanation in the previous answer A3, was added to section 2.2.\n\n\n### Response to Questions\n\n> Suggestion1: The DVS gesture recognition dataset, due to its event-based nature, might have been a really good fit for a method that learns delays.\n\nA5: We agree, but visual tasks usually require convolutions in the spatial domain. Our work focuses on simple fully connected networks, and extending it to convolutional spiking neural networks is one of our future directions. We started with tasks that are very dependent on temporal pattern detection since we think delays help most in these types of tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n> Suggestion2: Since delays use temporal information, it might have made more sense to use a loss function that made use of this (for e.g. time-to-first-spike loss)\n\n\nA6: Following this remark, we tried to use a loss function based on the time-to-first-spike (TTFS). The resulting accuracy was above the chance level, but very poor (around 8\\% on SHD). We think TTFS is ill-suited for sequence classification like here, because TTFS encourages early spikes, which, due to causality, ignore the end of the sequences.\n\n\n\n> Minor: Acronyms for task names are not explained in the results section\n\nA7: Thank you for this suggestion, we added the full names when the acronyms are used for the first time, i.e. at the beginning of the section 4.1 - experimental setup."

I'm convinced that this paper has additional contributions over the DCLS paper, but I still feel they are somewhat incremental -- application to SNNs, different applications, and small changes in architecture and intention. \nI thank the authors for the additional ablations, and the other fixes, which improves the paper.\nOverall, I'm willing to increase my score to 6."
