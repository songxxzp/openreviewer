                    "value": "This paper proposed a framework named BRAIN2MUSIC that maps fMRI data to music waveforms. BRAIN2MUSIC is based on pre-trained models MuLan and MusicLM. MuLan is a text/music embedding model with two encoders. MusicLM is a conditional music generation model. The authors align the fMRI representation with MuLan embeddings and use the embedding as conditions for music generation. The mapping between MuLan representation and fMRI is done by applying linear regression. In addition, the authors utilized a publicly available dataset music genre neuroimaging dataset to verify the performance of the proposed BRAIN2MUSIC."

                    "value": "* a) The main drawback of this work is that the conclusion drawn is not persuasive by adopting powerful pre-trained models and the limited data size of the dataset utilized in this work. Mulan is a music text embedding model that's pre-trained on a large amount of music/text data. Similarly, MusicLM is a powerful conditional music generation model pre-trained on large amounts of data. Say we randomly sample embeddings from the hidden state space of Mulan and use them as a condition to guide MusicLM; we get a piece of 'meaningful' music. By meaningful, I mean it sounds like music, not noise. Now, linearly mapping fMRI to the embedding space of Mulan to generate music does not necessarily show the correspondence between fMRI and music but the powerful representation ability of Mulan and the generation ability of MusicLM. I also carefully listened to the demos given. This confirmed my thought that the generated or reconstructed music sounds like real music but is not very similar to the stimulus music. This is also verified by the low correlation results demonstrated in Table 1. It would also be interesting to see the correlation result of only using the mean vector or random vectors to reconstruct the music.\n\n* b) No visualization results of the embeddings from fMRI to Mulan are given. Ideally, the embeddings $\\hat{T}$ on the test set should show a clustering effect.\n\n* c) Given the small size of the dataset, a K-fold evaluation should be adopted rather than a fixed test set with only 60 data points.\n\n* d) No comparisons are conducted w.r.t other works. Especially seq2seq approaches, meaning directly predicting music waveform using fMRI. Thus, it is hard to evaluate the solidness of this work."

                        "value": "We thank you very much for the review and would like to address the weaknesses pointed out:\n\na) While we acknowledge in Section 5 (Limitations) that our system's representation power is limited by MuLan, we emphasize that our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our system's performance significantly outperforms chance (randomly sampling from the MuLan embedding space). While the use of MusicLM contributes to the generation of pleasant-sounding music, the results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 would not surpass chance levels without the extraction of meaningful information from the input signal (fMRI recordings).\n\nb) Thanks for this suggestion. We ran a new analysis in which we take all MuLan embeddings predicted on the validation data and reduce their dimensionality from 128 down to 2 using a PCA. The resulting plot (with colors indicating genres) can now be found in [Figure A.6](https://github.com/f2mu/f2mu.github.io/blob/main/rebuttal-figures/fig-a6.png?raw=true) in the updated paper. We observe that the predictions form noisy clusters, most prominently for the genres _Classical_, _Hiphop_, and _Jazz_. To get a better feel for what to expect, we also PCA-dimensionality-reduced the ground truth MuLan embeddings (computed directly from the GTZAN eval data) and plotted them in juxtaposition.\n\nc) During the fMRI recording, our test-set is repeated several times to enhance SNR. This is a common approach in fMRI encoding/decoding analyses. It\u2019s not suitable for a k-fold CV, because the test examples are available with lower SNR. Apart from that, they are recorded in a separate run (i.e., temporally separated) from the train examples to be as certain as possible that there is no leakage (details are in Nakai et al. (2022)).\n\nd) In terms of comparison with other models, in our response to Reviewer QVSZ, we report the new results of constructing encoding models using different models. A detailed comparison of the prediction performance between different models and different brain regions yielded interesting insights. Particularly in terms of prediction performance, MuLan was found to be the most effective in predicting the auditory cortex during listening music.\n\nFurthermore, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published works that have performed music reconstruction using seq2seq in fMRI. Therefore, we believe our study is the first to establish a correspondence between fMRI brain activity for music and DNN features of music."

They then either select a clip that best matched the predicted embedding from a corpus (FMA) or they use the generation capacity of the model to generate a waveform. They show above chance ability to decode the model features, with the highest identification accuracy for the music embedding of MuLan. They report that they can better recover semantic properties, such as genres, instruments, and moods using the generative approach. \n\nFor the encoding analyses, they learn a linear map from different features of the MusicLM model to voxel data. They report that voxels are similarly well predicted by the w2v-BERT-avg and MuLan. They show that the encoding model predictions are better for the music variant of MuLan compared with the text variant consistent with better decoding. They also perform PCA on the weights from the learned encoding model and plot the stimulus and voxel embeddings."

For example, it is unclear whether the decoding model performs better at identification compared with the standard spectrotemporal modulation transfer model tested in Zakai. There is also no comparison against other DNN audio models such as wav2vec2.0 or HuBERT which have shown promising prediction accuracy in auditory cortex (the relation between w2v-BERT-avg and these prior models is unclear). \n\nThere are no perceptual experiments done to evaluate the quality of the reconstructions.\n\nThere is no serious investigation of how encoding and decoding results might vary across the auditory hierarchy. \n\nThere is no investigation of how performance might vary across different layers of the network in the case of the encoding models.\n\nFor encoding models there are no attempts to estimate the unique contribution of different models by comparing the performance of individual models against combined models. This is important as the features from different models are highly correlated. Thus a text-based model might predict auditory responses due to correlated features rather than a genuine response to text. As a consequence, the scatter plots showing correlated predictions is not surprising or particularly informative. \n\nThe statistical approach used to compute p-values does not seem appropriate, since it assumes the samples are independent and Gaussian distributed. They could use a permutation test across stimuli as an alternative. \n\nSome of evaluation metrics were unclear to me (see questions below)."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer very much for their review! Below we're addressing weaknesses and questions separately.\n\n**Rebuttal to weaknesses pointed out:**\n\nMotivated by your feedback, we have conducted new experiments and revised our manuscript following the insightful comments we received. This process uncovered several new insights, particularly in identifying previously unknown feature selectivity across hierarchy within the auditory cortex. We believe these revisions have significantly enriched the neuroscience aspect of our work. These additions have been included as new figures in the revision.\n\n> The analyses are fairly preliminary and there are currently no clear neuroscience insights.\n\nOur study is the first fMRI study to explore the relationship between the brain activity during music listening and DNNs for music generation. Given that music is very complex, the significance of finding models that accurately describe brain activity during musical engagement is substantial. Therefore, we believe that the findings of our study are of great importance.\n\nHowever, the reviewer's comments have been extremely beneficial in making our research more intriguing. In response to the comments, we have conducted several additional analyses as follows.\n\n> There are no comparisons against standard acoustic models used in the auditory neuroscience literature. [...]\n\nFollowing the comments, we constructed encoding models using non-DNN features (Mel-spectrogram), which are thought to capture lower-level music features, and different DNN features (Hubert and wav2vec2.0). Additionally, to address subsequent questions, we compared the prediction performance of each layer of the auditory cortex. Our findings are summarized as follows (please see the newly added [Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f2mu/f2mu.github.io/main/rebuttal-figures/fig-3.png) in the revised manuscript):\n\n1. MuLan demonstrated superior overall performance compared to the other models. Since it is an integral component of MusicLM, this may indicate the effectiveness of music generation models in exploring brain activity related to music. \n2. As anticipated, the prediction accuracy of the mel spectrogram decreased with the increasing hierarchy of the auditory cortex. \n3. However, strikingly, DNN features more accurately predicted the Lbelt/Pbelt regions (also known as A2/A3; early layers within the auditory hierarchy) than A1 (the earliest, primary auditory cortex), yet demonstrated lower performance in A4/A5 (association, higher auditory cortex). This trend has not been observed in other auditory neuroscience studies that focus on general sounds or speech, suggesting that it might be a phenomenon unique to music motivating further exploration.\n4. The observed decline in the prediction performance of mel spectrogram with ascending hierarchy suggests that the results for DNN features might reflect inherent differences in the features themselves, rather than mere differences in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across different ROIs.\n\nIn summary, thanks to the reviewer, we have gained new and interesting insights into the neural representation of music in neuroscience and machine learning models.\n\n> There are no perceptual experiments done to evaluate the quality of the reconstructions.\n\nDuring the short rebuttal period it is not feasible for us to undertake the requested rater study. We recognize this as a valuable addition for future work.\n\n> There is no serious investigation of how encoding and decoding results might vary across the auditory hierarchy.\n\nThis is also an important point. As mentioned above, we now compared the prediction performance of each layer of the auditory cortex and found the results as described.\n\n> There is no investigation of how performance might vary across different layers of the network in the case of the encoding models.\n\nIndeed, we believe this is interesting to explore in addition, but due to time constraints during the rebuttal period, we would like to address it as a future task."

The pipeline first uses fMRI recordings to predict music embeddings by a regularized linear regression; then, it applies the predicted music embeddings as conditions to MusicLM, where the MusicLM could recover or generate the corresponding music. In the experiments, this paper starts from a decoding task by quantitatively evaluating the music reconstruction; then, it illustrates the difference between text-derived and music-derived embeddings by designing an encoding task to predict fMRI recordings.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer very much for your review! Below we respond to the weaknesses and questions.\n\nReconstruction of music without precise rhythm, e.g., a symphony: Out of the 10 genres that GTZAN contains, one is classical. A non-cherry-picked example from it is in the supplementary material in sections _Comparison of Retrieval and Generation_ and _Comparison Across Subjects_ in the second row. Generally speaking, information about the exact timing of beats is very unlikely to be contained in fMRI scans due to their low temporal resolution. We do see, however, that a non-existent beat in the stimulus also leads to no beat being in the reconstruction.\n\nfMRI sampling rate: We have not explored the reconstruction of music based on fMRI scans obtained at a higher sampling rate. Exploring this is interesting future work, perhaps alongside the use of EEG, for example. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion."
