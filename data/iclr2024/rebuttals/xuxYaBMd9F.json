Including a comparison with other recent SSMs, such as S5 [1] or Hyena [2], would be highly beneficial.\n- The abovementioned models could be incorporated with SPADE by replacing the SSM module with any other model. However, it would be beneficial to understand whether the performance gap between SPADE and S4 is caused by adding Transformer blocks on top of the SSM module. Training SPADE with Hyena may not improve performance over Hyena while being better than SPADE with S4. In this case, the motivation for the paper will disappear.\n- I struggled to understand which SSM was used in SPADE (did I miss it?). It should be S4 based on the text. However, it would be helpful to name it in Section 3.2 explicitly.\n- The paper lacks reproducibility despite an extensive description of training within the text since no supplementary material with source code was released.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04933.pdf\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10866.pdf\n\nWhile at this point, I voted for rejecting this paper, I believe that flaws with baselines could be fixed.

SPADE integrates a state space model (SSM) into the bottom layer of a Transformer architecture, which enhances global information processing. This is complemented by local attention methods in the upper layers to handle local dependencies. The proposed method addresses the limitations of existing attention variants that struggle with long-range dependencies and computational inefficiency. SPADE demonstrates improved performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and various language modeling tasks. The architecture allows SPADE to scale efficiently and outperform baselines in both natural language understanding and generation tasks, with the additional benefit of being able to handle longer sequences than it was trained on due to the SSM's extrapolation capabilities."

In our pre-training experiments, we do not train the SSM in the bottom layer, and we only train the attention and FFN weights. Therefore, even though we set the pre-training length to 512, our pre-trained model can handle any sequence length during fine-tuning, e.g., the summarization tasks we considered.\n\n2. We conduct ablation experiments on the location and number of SSMs in Section 6.3. We conduct additional experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of SPADE. Specifically, we use S4, S5 [2], and Hyena [1] as the SSM in SPADE (Figure 3). We remark that other SSMs, such as GSS [3], are also outperformed by state-of-the-art models: S5 and Hyena. We also compare SPADE with positional embedding methods such as relative positional embedding and rotary positional embedding. We conduct language modeling experiments, and we report the ppl on the test set (lower the better). All models in the experiments have approximately 120M parameters. From the results, we can see that SPADE is easily extendable to accommodate various SSM. Moreover, for all configurations, we see that SPADE significantly outperforms the SSM-only model.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Our model is easier to scale compared with SSM-only models. In our experiments, we find that using a single SSM in the bottom layer suffices for the model to perform well. Therefore, the majority of SPADE are attention-based layers, which are easy to scale. \n\n2. Thank you for the suggestion. We will further investigate how SSMs propagate global information. We would like to highlight that in SPADE, we use the SSM to model global information, and we use the local attention modules to capture more fine-grained local information,\n\n|  | ppl |\n|---|---|\n| Transformer | 22.3 |\n| Transformer-Relative | 20.9 |\n| Transformer-Rotary | 20.8 |\n| S4 | 22.7 |\n| SPADE-S4 | 20.2 |\n| S5 | 23.0 |\n| SPADE-S5 | 20.0 |\n| Hyena | 22.9 |\n| SPADE-Hyena | 20.3 |\n\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10866.pdf \\\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.04933.pdf \\\n[3] https://openreview.net/forum?id=5MkYIYCbva"
