                    "value": "The paper leverages the transformers circuits work (Elhage '21) to uncover successor heads, which are attention heads in a transformer responsible for incrementing words / numbers which have a natural ordering. To do so, the authors build an Output-Value circuit for these successor heads, which unlike (Elhage '21), leverages a non-linear transformation of the word embeddings. The authors show that \n\n1. successor heads occur in many decoder-only transformer architectures, and across different model scales, and different types of incrementations\n2. Through several analyses and ablations (the use of linear probing on the MLP0 features, as well as the use of sparse autoencoder to extract important features for successor heads), the authors argue that the model's internal representaiton for numerical / incremental tasks is in modulo 10, i.e. that successor heads, when given input $f_{i}$, will increase the logits of $f_{i+1 \\  \\text{mod} \\  10}$. \n3. The authors show that these successor representations are amenable to vector arithmetic operations, and that while the MLP$_0$ representations are not biased towards incrementation, the OV circuit for successor head is. \n4. The authors argue that successor heads enable the identification of polysemantic behavior, finding evidence that they are responsible for both acronym prediction and incrementation."

I am not sure I understand why the authors distinguish between features that, when ablated, make the correct prediction less likely, and features that, when ablated, increase loss the most.

We hope we can address all of your comments.\n\n> The paper lacks a proper background section.\n\nAs addressed in our general comment, we have added a \u201cnotation\u201d paragraph and define terms before they are used.\n\n> Effective OV circuit : what is meant by effective here ?\n\nWe use \u201ceffective\u201d to emphasise that i) this includes MLP0, which is not standard in prior work and ii) this more closely matched how the model uses attention heads to transform information from embeddings to unembeddings\n\n> What was the motivation for using MLP rather than the original word embeddings ?\n\nLots of literature on Language Models has found that MLP0 is crucial for model representations, e.g Wang et al., 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593), Hanna et al., 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00586). Further, Pythia models use parallel attention (introduced in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.06745.pdf), ie the input to MLP0 is just the embedding and does not include the attention layer so it is even more natural for this architecture to not just use the word embeddings.\n\n> I am not sure I understand why the authors distinguish between features that, when ablated, make the correct prediction less likely, and features that, when ablated, increase loss the most.\u2019:\n\nWinning cases tell us about the tasks for which the successor head is the primary contributor compared to other heads. In contrast, describing loss reducing cases of the successor head is independent of how other heads behave on a task. Though we believe including an analysis of winning cases is important to describe the dominating behaviour of the successor head, a description of behaviour outside of such extreme cases is also necessary to give a full picture of behaviour, and this is the goal of our loss reducing experiments.\n\n> Did you happen to find a token where the successor head was important for each of the 128 samples ? Or did you bias your sampling towards extracts where the successor head is important ?\u2019:\n\nWe apologize for not being clearer here; the 128 samples from the Pile were randomly sampled (with no bias), and we have now specified this.\n\nIs this is a satisfactory reply to your concerns?"

In Section 4, direct effect mean ablation is used to show \"that when the successor head is contributing usefully, the prompts often required some kind of incrementation\". Then in Appendix J, direct effect mean ablation is used again to show that the successor head is the most important head across 64 prompts. Though this is stated with some evidence, not enough quantifiable evidence is shown here to justify the reach of these claims, such as the statement of \"mostly solved\". More analysis can also be shown about the \"direct effect\" to separate it from \"indirect effects\".\n\nThe paper also did not clarify the details of the ablation, such as if it used resampling ablation (there may be issues if it used mean ablation from the same dataset, as there are known issues with mean ablation [1]), and/or path patching (to obtain direct effects).\n\n[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kcZZAsEjwrbczxN2i/causal-scrubbing-appendix#3_Further_discussion_of_zero_and_mean_ablation\n\n2. The paper mentions that vector addition was performed successfully for 89% of the cases for digits 20-29, and mentions how it was performed on token '35'. It does not mention how this performed for other digits. This is likewise the case for number words only showing ten to twenty. Presumably, the performance is similar, but the paper should explicitly mention this to avoid criticism of cherry-picking.\n\nIn Figure 7, it's also unclear what \"target residues modulo 10\" means when referring to the column headers. Presumably, this is stating something similar to how the vector arithmetic on MLP0(E('fifth') makes it \"behave more like MLP0(E('seventh')\". The wording can be made clearer to avoid confusion that it means the number \"7\" rather than the word \"seventh\". Additionally, the checkmarks are given when \"the max logits are on the successor token\". This is an interesting result, but how big is the logit difference between logits for the successor token and other tokens? \n\nAppendix D states that scaling was used on the additive feature terms. A quick explanation of why a particular scaling factor was used would be helpful.\n\n3. The paper states: \"to the best of our knowledge the presence of both successorship and acronym behavior in head L12H0 is the cleanest example of polysemantic behavior identified so far in an LLM.\" Why is this the cleanest example of polysemantic behavior, compared to other studies on the topic such as in [2]? Similarly for this statement, \"which to the best of our knowledge are the most closely studied components in LLMs that occur in both small and large models\", what other components are you comparing to that are not as closely studied?\n\n[2] Wes Gurnee, Neel Nanda, Matthew Pauly, Katherine Harvey, Dmitrii Troitskii, and Dimitris Bertsimas.

                    "value": "Questions:\n1. While using MLP0 with successor heads, in isolation, was shown to be sufficient to perform incrementation, it is not shown how they interact with the rest of the models they belong to that the paper studied. How is this information about numerical features processed in later layers, from MLP0 to the successor head L12H0, then to the rest of the model? How does this end-to-end path interact with alternative paths, and inhibitory ones?\n\nThe mod-10 features are obtained from MLP0's outputs, to study how the end-to-end path of MLP0 to the successor head processes these features. However, the paper does not show how this information is processed through other layers and MLPs in the models. Can such mod-10 features be found in other layers?\n\n2. To continue on weak point #2:\nThere are also the cases of adding non-mod-10 features to numeric tokens, and adding the features to non-numeric tokens. There may be cases of \"confounding\" factors where U(OV(MLP0(E('twelve')) - f_2 + f_4)) has high logits for 'fourteen', but is it possible that adding non-numeric features will also shift twelve to thirteen, fourteen, etc.? If so, then perhaps these mod-10 features are just obtaining the correct change because of how the numeric features are scaled with one another? In other words, would subtracting non-numeric features R then adding RR obtain the same result? This is not a weak point of the paper as it may be beyond its scope, and this situation seems unlikely to be the case, but it can be further investigated for thoroughness. \n\n3. To continue on weak point #3:\nIn terms of interpretable polysemanticity, how do other heads compare to successor heads? To ensure acronym handling is not commonly done for many attention heads, how well do other heads handle acronyms?\n\n\n- Other comments:\n\nThis paper tackles a similar topic as a previous project from earlier this year, which also found a successor attention head by performing OV circuit analysis on inputs of numbers, number words, days, months, and letters. It also was stated to have inspected the effects of vector addition on number tokens [3]. Could the authors elaborate on the similarities and differences? \n\n[3] https://alignmentjam.com/project/one-is-1-analyzing-activations-of-numerical-words-vs-digits"

                        "value": "Thank you for your kind words about our paper. We hope we can clarify all your questions, please reply if there are more issues. We draw your attention to a new Appendix (L) that does more ablation experiments in response to your concerns.\n\n> not enough quantifiable evidence is shown here to justify the reach of these claims, such as the statement of \"mostly solved\u201d\n\nThis is a good point, and we agree that the indirect effects should have been studied. We have now analysed the indirect and the total effect for the loss reducing experiments, and evidence that indirect effects do not play a significant role in successorship. These results are described in Appendix L.\n\n> The paper also did not clarify the details of the ablation\n\nWe apologize for not specifying this. Our experiments in Section 4 used direct effect mean ablation, taking the mean on the same batch, and we have now included this detail. Additionally, we have repeated our loss reducing experiments using resampling ablation instead of mean ablation and see similar results, with results described in Appendix L.\n\n> Presumably, the performance is similar, but the paper should explicitly mention this to avoid criticism of cherry-picking\n\nWe have now mentioned that performance is similar across other tokens and have included some additional arithmetic tables, displayed in Appendix O.\n\n> it's also unclear what \"target residues modulo 10\" means when referring to the column headers\n\nWe have included an example of what we mean by \u2018target residue\u2019 in the caption of Figure 6 (this figure was Figure 7). We hope this makes things clearer.\n\n> how big is the logit difference between logits for the successor token and other tokens?\n\nWe have included the logit distributions for randomly sampled checkmarked cells in Appendix P to give a picture as to how the logits differ across tokens.\n\n> A quick explanation of why a particular scaling factor was used would be helpful\n\nWe agree that this aspect should be described further and have added some more explanation behind choosing the scaling factor in Appendix D.\n\n> what other components are you comparing to that are not as closely studied?\n\nWe are comparing to induction heads (https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html), the only other interpretable, recurring language model component in small and large models that we claim do not have as crisp an explanation as successor heads (analyzing attention patterns is not an end-to-end explanation) - we have now reviewed this in the related work section.\n\n> Why is this the cleanest example of polysemantic behavior?\n\nThank you for the reference to the Gurnee et al. work. We agree that this provides helpful evidence about polysemanticity in neurons. We think that our work is cleaner, since we measure the loss explained by the succession, acronym and other behaviors (Figure 10). This shows that this attention head\u2019s direct effect has over half of its behavior explained by these behaviors \u2013 Gurnee et al show that some neurons implement several different tasks, but don\u2019t make claims about the role of these neurons across the whole training distribution. It is possible that their bigram examples do not explain the majority of the role of this neuron in the model.\n\n> This paper discovers novel and interesting observations, but it does not elaborate much on why this observation is impactful enough\n\nWe agree that the primary contribution of our work is about interesting phenomena without a directly impactful outcome. However, as elaborated in the introduction, there are several second-order effects of our work. Firstly, we provide useful evidence about the universality of representations in models: successor heads generalize to larger models, but cross-task generalization is more complicated, such as how steering the successor head on days of the week did not produce as strong results. Additionally, we find evidence that models have compositional representations, such as combining a mod 10 feature with task-based information to produce certain completions, suggesting that LLMs have sophisticated internal structure, a similar conclusion to https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207, but from a different angle (numeracy). Finally, our work shows another bit of evidence for the strength of Sparse Autoencoders, which in parallel to our work were found to have a lot of success at almost completely explaining a small language model (https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features), which we hope the interpretability field will find useful.\n\n(This rebuttal is continued in \"Rebuttal to reviewer ExhM (2/2)\")"

                        "value": "(Continued from \"Rebuttal to reviewer ExhM (1/2)\")\n\n> How is this information about numerical features processed in later layers, from MLP0 to the successor head L12H0, then to the rest of the model? How does this end-to-end path interact with alternative paths, and inhibitory ones? (...) the paper does not show how this information is processed through other layers and MLPs in the models.\n\nWe believe that a full exploration of these details is out-of-scope for our work, however we have added analysis of the indirect effect to a new Appendix to our work (Appendix L). This suggests that processes occurring after the successor head\u2019s output may not play a significant role to succession, hence an analysis beyond the direct effect is less important.\n\n> would subtracting non-numeric features R then adding RR obtain the same result?\n\nWe are not sure we understand this concern. We have included additional experiments exploring the separability of the numeric and task subspaces in Appendix M, which we hope you appreciate. These demonstrate that we can isolate a common numeric subspace within embedding space, that for any given token (e.g. \u2018February\u2019), encodes the index of that token within its ordinal sequence (e.g. months). If this does not address your concern, let us know.\n\n> To ensure acronym handling is not commonly done for many attention heads, how well do other heads handle acronyms?\n\nWe consider this investigation out of scope, and not part of our main contribution of our work. The results on acronyms are intended to show that 1) attention head polysemanticity can be observed in practice but that 2) it is not necessarily an intractable phenomena. Acronym behavior accounts for over 10% of the loss recovered by the successor head. Acronyms occupy less than 1% of the pretraining data and therefore it is very unlikely that this attention head is not one of the most important model components for completing acronyms. We are excited for further research into attention head polysemanticity and hope our work spurs this on.\n\n> Could the authors elaborate on the similarities and differences?\n\nThough the referenced project similarly studies model behaviour on tasks involving incrementation and finds a successor head, it is limited to a single successor head in a small model (GPT-2 Small), whereas our work finds that this is a more general and recurring phenomena in larger models of varying architecture, and we describe an end-to-end circuit that can perform incrementation using these heads. Our work also performs a weight-level analysis of successor heads, allowing us to discover mod-10 features, however the referenced project does not perform such an analysis. They also do not investigate how their found successor head performs on natural language datasets and the tasks for which it is important for, which we analyze in Section 4. We were not aware of this work (and it is outside the time period of necessary consideration and non-archival) but have added it as a reference and are glad that some of our results were found independently.\n\nHave we addressed all further concerns you had with our work?"

Basing judgments of novelty on publication date alone seems questionable when substantive overlap exists between ideas and findings. Though understandable given the recency of some relevant cautionary findings, the argument that a particular study entered the public domain after a given date does not convincingly address fundamental concerns about the degree of new insights offered here.\n\nI still believe this is solid research, but in reassessing its novelty through comparison with previously proposed work, I find that key contributions appear modest. Consequently, I have reconsidered the scores assigned, aiming to better reflect the incremental nature of what has been achieved. I hope this explanation helps clarify my perspective."

We agree that we were not clear about how our work improves on existing work. We intended to emphasise how a mechanistic understanding of anything in a large, non-toy model is unusual. We have slightly rephrased this (within ICLR 2024 policy) to say\n\n*Existing research in this area has struggled to find recurring, mechanistically interpretable language model components beyond small toy models. Further, existing results have led to very little insight to explain the internals of larger models that are used in practice.*\n\nand we have also added to the \u201cTransformer Circuits\u201d part of the related work.\n\n> The only evidence of these [mod 10 features] being used on other task is a low success percentage on changing output month\n\nWe disagree with this statement. In Section 3.1 we show our results on Linear Probing, where we find that probing for mod 10 features generalizes to test data, and even to unseen tasks, with high accuracy. Our paper was also upfront about the limitations of steering with mod 10 features at the end of Section 3, but the mod 10 results are stronger (see also the next answer).\n\n> I would expect for tasks like months and days there would be other mod-12 or mod-7 features\n\nTo investigate this, we trained linear probes (as per Section 3.2) for all moduli from 2 to 25. Of all probes tested, we found that the mod-10 probe had the **joint highest in-distribution accuracy** (together with the mod-2, 4, 5 and 20 probes) and the **highest out-of-distribution accuracy**: not only is \u2018mod-10 data\u2019 easiest to extract from MLP0-representations, but the relevant features generalise well.\n\nWe also found that the mod-7 and mod-12 probes **performed worse than the mod-10 probe** at predicting the residues of weeks and months respectively.\n\nFull details and results for this experiment are provided in Appendix Q.\n\n> How was the set of succession datasets chosen?\n\nWe included all single tokens we could find that were involved in listing, though kept Roman numerals as a held out task.\n\n> Did you experiment with other tasks that were eventually not included?\n\nWe used Roman numerals as a held out test case for Linear Probing, and found that the model still performed well. We extended our study of this task to evaluate succession score in response to your comment, and show these further strong results in Appendix B2."

We respond accordingly to your comments and questions below.\n\n> It is really inconvenient for the reader to go back and forth during the reading.:\n\nAs described in our global response, we have addressed your concern by defining terms the first time we use them, and moving the glossary to before the appendices. We hope this change makes reading the paper more convenient.\n\n> It lacks sufficient descriptions for the reader to understand the process that parses the original output of the attending heads to the sparse encoder\u2019s output.:\n\nWe have modified our description of the sparse encoder experiments to further clarify the methodology of Section 3. Additionally, we have further elaborated on our use of SAEs in Appendix A.2, including a diagram to illustrate the process.\n\n> Can you demonstrate the full story about polysemantics when you relax the constraint of importance by choosing large n?\u2019:\n\nThis is an interesting question. We ran the loss reducing experiments (described by Figure 10) but instead using top-50 for each behaviour and this gave the loss proportions: 39.6% for successorship, 20.4% for acronym, 12.3% for greater-than, and 20.8% for copying behaviour, which accounts for a total of 93.1% of behaviour, hence using a large $n$ does appear to capture most behaviour. A slightly stronger condition of top-25 still accounts for a total of 85.8% of behaviour.\n\nPlease ask at any time if you think we could improve further."
