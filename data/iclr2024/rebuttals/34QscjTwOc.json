                    "value": "This paper builds upon past work that attempts to explain the behavior of DNNs through the lens of interactions of features (or groups of features). These interactions are characterized by (a) a hard subset of features, i.e. \"all else being equal\"-type interactions (b) their predictive strength, i.e. if the model sees only this subset, how far off is it.\n\nIn this work in particular, this is achieved not in input space but rather in a PCA decomposition of the latent space. Great care is taken to ensure that removing a feature maintains consistency within the model (e.g. by taking the average activation). The paper shows that (a) in simple problems few interaction hold most of the predictive power, and (b) these interactions can be given some semantic label."

The first, which makes me also concerned for novelty, is that this paper mostly builds on prior work except for applying the methods on a PCA decomposition rather than on input patches.\n\nSecond, the buildup to the binning of features into 5 categories was interesting, almost captivating, but then the binning itself was quite underwhelming. Why these 5 categories? How are they formally defined? (As it is, it feels like a human looked at each curve and decided; Appendix E does not clarify the matter.) Do they have any predictive power? \n\nWhat should be the main contribution of this paper feels like an afterthought. Here are some suggestions which I think could improve this work:\n- Most importantly, formalize these 5 categories into formulas or very clear algorithms. Show that these are robust, distinct categories through clustering, PCA, t-sne, or somehow.\n- Experiment with design choices, and validate that these categories reflect _known_ or expected behaviors of DNNs as the capacity/kind/architecture of a model changes. For example the authors posit that residual connections have some precise impact. This should be an experiment.\n- Find the predictive power of these categories, for example, do models with more fluctuating interactions overfit more?\n\nI'm hopeful for this work but I don't think it its current form this paper is a good contribution, accepting it now would feel like a missed opportunity for the authors to deliver something much more interesting and impactful."

                    "value": "> Nevertheless, the number of salient interactions with considerable utilities is still significantly lower than the exponential number of all potential $2^{n+1}$ interactions \n\nThis does seem almost certainly true. That being said, the search for interesting subsets does still require a search over $O(2^n)$ interactions. The solution proposed in the paper to only look at the top-r (10?) PCs is a bit underwhelming, and feels like it would miss a very heavy tail of interesting interactions for any interesting dataset [1].\n\nFigures 3 & 4 should really have a logarithmically scaled y-axis.  \nGenerally, I'm not a fan of the figures, they are all pretty small and it is hard to discern what is going on. I'd suggest thinking of different ways to present this information, probably by overlaying these curves into one plot or presenting the information in a different way (via different quantities).\n\n[1] interesting dataset, which, while I haven't commented on it above, I think is missing from this paper. I understand these experiments can be computationally demanding, but at the same time, MNIST can be solved to 93% accuracy with a linear classifier, CIFAR-10 to 86% with a 75k-parameter ResNet. These are not very \"rich\" datasets for which one would expect lots of interesting interactions."

Estimating the relevant saliency regions of the input is known to be a hard problem, due to the exponential scaling of possible input variables subsets. The authors hence introduce a PCA estimation of the most relevant components in an intermediate hidden layer by collecting the activations coming from different epochs. This allows them to determine the Harsanyi dividend by composing different hidden feature projections, instead of masking input variables. With the experiments, it is shown that these interactions can be distinguished based on a taxonomy of 5 different temporal behaviors, shedding light on the kind of interactions different models are typically using for solving training tasks."

Previous works have assessed that the AND and OR Harsanyi interactions that arise in the neural network are sparse and are actually useful for visualizing the relevant input variables for the predictions. The major contribution of this work is presenting a way to estimate the interactions in a simpler manner by computing the principal components in the temporal ensemble of hidden activations. Doing this alleviates the computational cost of previous methods while highlighting different behaviors during training.  \n\nThe proposed method is sound and attains good sparsity results in all preliminary analyses, showing it is relevant for evaluating the primitive interactions of the model. Moreover, the use of PCA analysis connects this formulation to other approaches in XAI that instead mine concepts in the hidden layers of DNNs (see the questions). This could be useful to reconcile two apparently different research directions in XAI.\n\nI found writing is clear and the paper's claims are sound, including a good quantity of material in the supplementary. I suggest the authors also include their implementation code for reproducibility."

                    "value": "One aspect that has not been analyzed thoroughly in the paper is the actual consistency between the estimation of the primitive interactions at the input level and at the intermediate level. It somehow sidelined in the main text how the estimation of the interactions in an intermediate layer is a consistent estimator of the interactions at the input level.  Given that, passing to intermediate representations may hinder somehow the quality of the interactions that are obtained at the input: there is the risk that two different intermediate-level interactions will capture the same input-level interaction. An example of this can be noted by the pretty-quite similar activation maps in  Figure (b) for the 1st and 2nd salient interactions of the 0 digit. I guess that given this result more discussion on this point should be addressed.\n\nSome other details are less clear from the text, which however do not constitute a major weakness in the presented material. One aspect is that the discussion on the five groups of interactions is quite short and lacks details about the results in Figure (10). It is said that the 100 maximally higher interactions were selected for each DNN, but are the results specific for one sample or averaged over the dataset? Also, in Figure 5 it is said that it is measured the \"average error\" by using the Top $\\alpha$ components, but I understood that the y-axis measures the network output, whereas the shaded region is the approximation error. Is the blue line the ground truth value for the sorted $S$?"

How would results changing using a different intermediate layer?\n  - Why use the threshold values for rank, approximation error for salient feature count, the number of training epochs used, among others?\n  - Are the results in Figure 5a, 5b, and 5c each for one \"sample\", \"sentence\", and \"image\" in the single DNN model and single dataset listed?\n- Do Figures X and Y show results for randomly sampled images? Since it's impossible to confirm whether this was actually the case, are there examples that do not align with these results, or even contradict these results? Is there analysis as to why?\n- The novelty of using PCA to reduce interaction count seems incremental and the significance of the paper results is unclear to me. Using PCA to reduce the interaction count seems intuitive, as PCA aims to retain the maximum information in the data with the reduced dimensionality chosen, assuming certain assumptions are met.
