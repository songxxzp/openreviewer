For instance, the variables and\nnotations of EQ 1 are only defined in the appendix. Also what EDP or\nPE is, is not clear from the main text.

Then one could simply compute once $W\\mathbf{k}$ for complete synaptic integration in TW. This would\nsimilarly reduce the weight-reuse dramatically and would not need to\nallocate different scales for the various time steps within the TW. Since spike-time\ninformation is eliminated within a TW when using STT, this looks to me an equivalent\napproach. Moreover, it seems that the implementation might be much simpler and\nenergy savings considerable. However, the systolic array architecture\nmight not support an integer multiplication. It would be interesting to discuss this alternative approach."

                    "value": "1. A first concern is the hardware baseline. The authors measure EDP against the hardware baseline without STT or ITT. However, parallel processing SNNs in terms of TW has been proposed in [1], which is similar to the ITT methods. I think the authors should consider some recent acceleration baselines. Besides, the difference between ITT and [1] should be discussed since both introduce parallel computing towards time-windowed data. \n2. The STT-based compression actually reorganizes the spikes within all TWs by putting them to the end of the window (conversion to first spike time and doing prefix-sum), which breaks the order of spikes inside TW. Since Table 1 does not expose severe performance degradation when TWS grows larger, the reason could also be that the datasets themselves are insensitive to such reorganization of spikes. In such cases, the low-performance loss should be ascribed to the property of datasets rather than the proposed methods.\n3. The authors claim TSSL-BP to be a state-of-the-art SNN training method, while seas of novel studies with notably higher training accuracies, such as IM-Loss[2], TEBN[3], TIT[4], based on surrogate gradient has been proposed in the past few years. Since the STT only relies on the rate-based coding scheme which is shared among most nowadays SNNs, the authors should also perform similar experiments on surrogate gradient-trained SNNs.\n\n\n[1] Jeong-Jun Lee, Wenrui Zhang, and Peng Li.

Specifically, the authors propose Split-Time Temporal Coding, which increases sparsity and Integration Through Time scheme, both operating on time windows that can be processed in parallel. The authors report a latency reduction of 77x and improved energy efficiency by 60x on standard benchmarks such as DVS gesture."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The advantages of the proposed coding strategy did not convince me. The Split-Time Temporal Coding targets spiking networks that extensively use rate-coding neurons and are not optimized for sparsity. It is well documented that spiking neural networks, which primarily rely on rate coding neurons, are less efficient than ANNs when simulated on digital hardware (Davidson and Furber 2021). By not explicitly considering this during training, the authors may be solving a problem of their own making.\n\nThe methods were incomplete and opaque, and it was not clear how the networks were trained. For instance, basic information as to how input was encoded or how many time-steps were used for simulating the network was missing? Was sparsity encouraged during training? The authors point to Zhang & Li (2020), but in their work, they often use only five time steps, which many would not consider a spiking neural network. Overall, it was unclear what the proposed strategies gain over established state-of-the-art work.\n\nThe presentation of the results took a lot of work to follow. For instance, I could not find the 77x latency reduction proclaimed in the abstract in the results figures.\n\nOne misses a thorough comparison to existing work that proposed similar yet more powerful coding schemes, e.g., (St\u00f6ckl and Maass 2021).\n\nThe present work mainly compares to its reference implementation. For instance, one misses a comparison to job that tried to quantify the computational cost more carefully, e.g. (Yin, Corradi, and Boht\u00e9 2021).\n\n\n\n## References\n\nDavidson, Simon, and Steve B.
