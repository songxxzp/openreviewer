For instance, Section 3 is cahotic and unfinished.\n- As a consequence, it is difficult to evaluate the experimental contributions of this work.\n- Some sentences convey an inapropriate tone, either overconfident or unscientific (\"we offer a fresh narrative on...\", \"finding its nullspace is known art\", \"This observation leads to a provocative question\", \"Our work marks an important stride in the understanding of ...\")."

As underlined by the authors, the nullspace is a concept from linear algebra. When moving to the nonlinear world, its counterpart is the zero set. This is a common tool in convex optimization [1] which the authors may want to investigate. It seems however that rather than looking for a set of zeros, the authors are more interested in looking for invariance of the ViT wrt some additive subspaces (this is equation (5)). It may be interesting to change a bit the narrative to motivate it by invariant properties instead of null space properties?\n2. Similarly, the authors state in the conclusion that \"Our findings demonstrate that a non-trivial nullspace indeed exists\" but I am not sure that the paper shows that. The authors show that a nullspace exists for the patch embedding layer, but then the full study resolves more around invariance properties of the ViT than its nullspace.\n3. The authors write: \"We ascertain that employing noise sampled from this approximate nullspace for data augmentation significantly enhances model robustness ...\". This formulation suggests that the training of the ViT performance can improve when trained on data from its nullspace; however if the data shown to the network belong to its nullspace, how can it have an influence on its output?\n4. I have an issue with loss (6). Unless I misunderstood, it is not lower bounded because no constraint is added. Thus, the minimum of (6) is reached by any vector of infinite norm. Why not add any constraint in the norm of $\\tilde{v}$? I suspect this is why early stopping is needed (page 18)?\n5. More generally, I find it interesting to look for vectors of relatively large norms, showing that very different inputs can provide the same output. However, a problem is that the resulting vector $u+\\tilde{v}$, where $u$ is a natural image, is not a natural image. What are the potential applications in this context? Is it better for a model to be robust to nullspace variations than to common adversarial attacks?\n6. Section 3 is very clearly unfinished, with unrelated sentences and equations. What is the narrative from (7) to (10)?\n7. In section 3, the authors state that \"we demonstrated that there may exist a non-isotropic space\". Was it really shown that it is non isotropic?\n8. Section 4.4 is very difficult to follow. What is the aim of the experiment presented there? For instance, the authors claim \"the noise was always able to enter the $\\epsilon$ region\". But how can we be sure? Does any metric check that? This is not what Fig. 3 is showing, or I misunderstand?\n9. The writing style is often inapropriate. I would suggest the authors adopt a more neutral tone. Here are few examples and why I think these are not appropriate:\n     - \"Our work marks an important stride in the understanding of [something]...\" : this sounds presomptuous, readers will judge if this is \"an important stride\". Instead, the authors could say \"Our work provides an explanation of [something] by ...\". Similarly, \"we offer a fresh narrative\" sounds weird.\n     - \"This observation leads to a provocative question: Can the inherent properties of ViTs be harnessed to bolster their robustness?\" First of all, I think the question is not provocative at all, it is typically the kind of questions that are asked in this conference. Secondly, the question could be reformulated in a less theatrical way. For instance: \"This observation raises the following question: Can we leverage the inherent properties of ViTs to enhance their robustness?\"\n\n**Minor comments**\n\n1. Some notations are unclear. For example, $f(u)[0]$ mixes mathematical and informatics notations. Why not use $f_0(u)$? \n2. \"This implies that 0 is always a solution to the said equation. As the number of solutions to a system of linear equations can vary, the nullspace for a mapping can be trivial, non-trivial, or does not exist.\" You just showed above that a trivial nullspace always exists for a linear mapping. How can the nullspace not exist?\n3. \"In terms of solving for $\\mathcal{N}$?\": why this question? I think that the footnote does not need to be introduced by a question.\n4. For the remark after Proposition 1: there is no need to explain the proposition in the remark. I would suggest to only keep the informative example, and detail more on this example. Is this a condition that is met experimentally? Is this realistic?\n5. Maybe the authors could change the NeurIPS watermark to an ICLR watermark?\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Bauschke, H. H., and P. L.

Although the common definition of nullspace doesn\u2019t apply to the nonlinear transformer encoder, we empirically find a set of vectors in the input space of the transformer encoder which preserves one property of nullspace that is important to robustness, i.e., invariance of the mapping\u2019s output when added to any input, with good precision on the data distribution. Additionally, our experiment in Appendix A.5 suggests that the $\\epsilon$-approximate version of such a set satisfies the properties of closure under addition and scalar multiplication in a considerable scope, similar to those of a vector space. Thus, we extend the definition of nullspace in linear algebra to \u201cencoder-level nullspace\u201d in Equation (5), to highlight the similarity between the explored set and nullspace in linear algebra. \n\nWe\u2019ve considered some well-established concepts in mathematics, such as \u201czero set\u201d or \u201cinvariant set\u201d, as alternative terminology, but they carry their own meanings and have different implications from our work. In Section 2.3 of our manuscript, we delineated the nuances of our extended definition with a focus on the invariance property. \n\nTo address your concern, we have refined our writing in Section 2.3 and the conclusion to make the distinction more explicit. \n\n> **Q2.A: Similarly, the authors state in the conclusion that \"Our findings demonstrate that a non-trivial nullspace indeed exists\" but I am not sure that the paper shows that.** \n\nThanks for this comment. The complete sentence in our paper was \u201cOur findings demonstrate that a non-trivial nullspace indeed exists for Vision Transformers, a direct consequence of the patch embedding layer.\u201d In section 2.2, we first showed that a non-trivial nullspace exists within the patch embedding layer. Then, because vectors in this set would not affect the entire model\u2019s output when added to any input, this nullspace is a subset of the nullspace of the transformer model, according to our extended definition in Equation (5).\n\n> **Q2.B: The authors show that a nullspace exists for the patch embedding layer, but then the full study resolves more around invariance properties of the ViT than its nullspace.**\n\nOur discussion on the nullspace of the patch embedding layer, and on the nullspace of the nonlinear encoder according to our extended definition, are concrete definitions of invariance of the transformer model to input perturbations, in contrast to the broadly used \u201cinvariance\u201d, which is often vaguely defined as model\u2019s output does not change with certain (or even any) perturbations of input data. \n\n> **Q3: The authors write: \"We ascertain that employing noise sampled from this approximate nullspace for data augmentation significantly enhances model robustness ...\". This formulation suggests that the training of the ViT performance can improve when trained on data from its nullspace; however if the data shown to the network belong to its nullspace, how can it have an influence on its output?**\n\nThanks for this question. We hope to clarify that our original claim quoted in the review is about \u201capproximate nullspace\u201d, for which our definition is the set of vectors which causes a mean $\\ell_2$ distance of less than $\\epsilon$ on the output logits when added to the input over the data distribution], as in Equation (7). It can have effects on the model by definition.  The goal is to reduce the impact of the identified approximate noise on the network and by doing this we make the model more robust."

Thus, the minimum of (6) is reached by any vector of infinite norm.** \n\nThank you for the observation. For \\lambda < \\infty, whether a vector of infinite norm is a minimizer of the entire loss function will also depend on the 1st term. For example, if we consider a simple case where both f in (6) are identity functions, then a vector of infinite norm is instead the maximizer. \n\n> **Q4.B Why not add any constraint in the norm of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}$?**\n\nWe agree this can potentially help prevent the discussions of extreme cases, however, in practice, we did not find it necessary. We noticed that the learning of $\\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}$ can always converge with the different values of $\\lambda$ in our experiments. \nIn addition, we had considered adding a bound constraint, but since we don\u2019t have prior knowledge about how large the noise should at least be, we later decided to use a logarithm term to prevent a trivial solution. \n\n> **Q4.C  I suspect this is why early stopping is needed (page 18)?**\n\nIn our work, early stopping was used as a heuristic to find vectors close to the boundary of the $\\epsilon$-approximate nullspace. It is used in combination with Equation (6), which minimizes the influence of the noise with gradient descent until it reaches the $\\epsilon$ region. Here, we no longer use the regularization term to prevent trivial solution.\n\nAdditionally, the effectiveness of our data augmentation method does not rely on the early stopping heuristic. To validate this, we experimented on removing early stopping, and kept other settings the same as our experiment for row 2 of Table 1. We learn the nullspace noise with a fixed number of iterations T. We set T to be large enough so that the learned noise can enter the $\\epsilon$ area every time after the fine-tuning starts. The below table shows the performance on various benchmarks, and compared it with the early stopping setting in row 2 of our Table 1.\n\n|  Early stop | clean | FGSM  | DamageNet |   A   | C (\u2b63) |  V2   |   R   | Sketch | Stylized |\n|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|:---------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:--------:|\n| Yes | 77.47 | 25.95 |   32.43    | 20.77  | 55.98 | 66.5   | 41.61 | 25.67  |  16.02   |\n|  No  | 77.01 | 28.84 |   30.26   | 19.68  | 57.68 | 66.77 | 44.21 | 29.40  |  17.31   |\n\nIt can be seen that the performance of these two settings are comparable. We have added both the variants to the results table.\n\n\n> **Q5: More generally, I find it interesting to look for vectors of relatively large norms, showing that very different inputs can provide the same output. However, a problem is that the resulting vector $\\mathbf{u} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}$, where $\\mathbf{u}$ is a natural image, is not a natural image. What are the potential applications in this context? Is it better for a model to be robust to nullspace variations than to common adversarial attacks?**\n\nThank you for this inspiring question. When we find vectors of relatively large norms, the resulting vector $\\mathbf{u} + \\tilde{\\mathbf{v}}$ can easily go beyond the pixel range of [0, 255]. However, there are still interesting applications. For example, we can consider these vectors a characteristic of the model being trained, and use it to identify the models, which is related to the application of model patenting. Another interesting aspect that can arise is that of gaining customer trust with regards to privacy. If a server-side ML model can support \u201cunnatural\u201d inputs, a user can effectively hide(transform) their data while preserving the intended inference output. Making it challenging to recover original \u201cnatural\u201d images if/when leaked or stolen."

What is the narrative from (7) to (10)?**\n\nWe did complete the writing of Section 3, and we are sorry for any confusion brought to readers. We have added a few transition sentences and explanations in our paper, to improve the coherence of discussion. \nIn addition to the text edited in the main paper, here are some additional explanations of Section 3. \n\nEquation (7) defines the space of additive perturbations that have minute influence to the model\u2019s output. We use $\\epsilon$ as the upper bound of the influence measured by MSE of the output logits, so that the space is specified with a given $\\epsilon$ and a given model;\n\nEquation (8) defines the problem of finding the largest vector in this space as a reflection of its size;\n\nEquation (9) specifies the loss function used to learn the nullspace noise, which is used in combination with the early stopping method to heuristically solve the problem in Equation (8);\n\nEquation (10) specifies the loss function used in our data augmentation method, in which we used the noise learned by Equation (9) and early stopping to conduct data augmentation.\n\n\n\n> **Q7: In section 3, the authors state that \"we demonstrated that there may exist a non-isotropic space\". Was it really shown that it is non isotropic?**\n\nYes, in Section 2.3, we measured the influence of the learned vectors in terms of MSE probability and percentage of matching predictions. We also experimented with resetting their directions by randomly shuffling their elements. The real and dashed lines in Fig. 2 shows that while the learned vectors are benign to the model, their shuffled version significantly degrades the model\u2019s predictions at different values of $\\lambda$. This shows that the noise vectors produce far less influence on the model\u2019s output than they would if they were in a random direction with the same norm, which indicates that the space is non-isotropic.\n\n> **Q8: Section 4.4 is very difficult to follow. What is the aim of the experiment presented there? For instance, the authors claim \"the noise was always able to enter the  region\". But how can we be sure? Does any metric check that? This is not what Fig. 3 is showing, or I misunderstand?**\n\n  > **What is the aim of the experiment presented there?**\n\nThe aim of this experiment is to use a data augmentation approach to enlarge the $\\epsilon$-approximate nullspace of the model and see its effect on the model\u2019s robustness. This is to explore the relationship between the nullspace and robustness.\n\n\n  > **For instance, the authors claim \"the noise was always able to enter the  region\". But how can we be sure?**\n\nThe claim \"the noise was always able to enter the region\" was indeed not reflected in Fig. 3, but we carefully verified from the output of our experiment scripts that early stopping was triggered, which means the noise entered the $\\epsilon$-approximate region. We have added the noise influence evaluation in Appendix A.6.\n\n  > **Does any metric check that?**\n\nThe early stopping for learning noise our method (Section 3) is based on the condition that the noise has an influence less than $\\epsilon$ in terms of MSE probability. We carefully verified from our experiment logs that early stopping was always triggered after the fine-tuning started, which means the noise entered the $\\epsilon$-approximate region. \n\n  > **This is not what Fig. 3 is showing, or I misunderstand?**\n\nWe hope to clarify the misunderstanding. Fig. 3 did not show this piece of information, but only showed the change trend of the noise norm and several performance metrics with the fine-tuning steps. We have updated the draft in Section 4.4 to improve clarity.\n\n> **Q9: The writing style is often inapropriate. I would suggest the authors adopt a more neutral tone. Here are few examples and why I think these are not appropriate:**\n\nThank you for the suggestions. We have examined the writing style of our whole paper, and modified multiple places for a more neutral and humble tone, including the examples you provided.\n\n> **Minor comments** \n\nThank you for providing a thorough review of our work. We acknowledge the minor comments and have subsequently updated our paper to reflect the same. We will be uploading the latest draft of our work in a short while."

Please find below my remaining questions.\n\n**Q. 4a** The argument of the authors holds for $f_{\\psi}\\circ f_{\\phi} = \\operatorname{Id}$. Yet, the authors are precisely looking for a vector $v$ such that $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u+v))-f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u))= 0$, which suggests that $f_{\\psi}\\circ f_{\\phi} \\neq \\operatorname{Id}$. Assume that such $v^*\\neq 0$ exists; if $\\forall \\lambda>0$, $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u+\\lambda v^*))-f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u))= 0$, then $\\mathcal{L}(\\lambda v^*)\\underset{\\lambda\\to\\infty}{\\to}-\\infty$. Moreover, if $f_{\\psi}\\circ f_{\\phi}$ contains some thresholding operations, ensuring that $f_{\\psi}\\circ f_{\\phi}$ is bounded, then the infimum of $\\mathcal{L}$ is $-\\infty$. This is problematic because nothing tells a priori whether the loss function aims at ensuring $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u+v))-f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u))= 0$ or $||v||\\to\\infty$, and it may return a vector of large (infinite) norm that does not at all satisfy $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u+v))-f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi} (u))= 0$.\n\n**Q. 6** Section 3 is a little bit improved but remains unclear. For example, equation (9) is between (but not included in) two independent sentences. Equation (10) is starting a sentence. I think this section would be significantly clearer if (9) and (10) were written in a whole bilevel problem.\n\n**Training loss** The training loss is not explicitely mentionned in the experimental part. \"We use the $\\epsilon$-approximate nullspace noise as data augmentation to fine-tune the model.\" What loss is used to do that?

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate your continued effort in reviewing our submission, and your insightful follow-up questions. Below are our responses:\n\n> Q. 4a The argument of the authors holds for $f_{\\psi} \\circ f_{\\phi} = \\text{Id}$. Yet, the authors are precisely looking for a vector $v$ such that $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u + v)) - f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u)) = 0$, which suggests that $f_{\\psi} \\circ f_{\\phi} \\neq \\text{Id}$. \n\nWe agree that this particular example does not allow non-zero vectors to satisfy $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u + v)) - f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u)) = 0$. However, we used the identity function as a conceptual example to show that whether Equation (6) goes to negative infinity as the noise vector scales depends on whether the first term grows more rapidly than the second term. \n\n> Assume that such $v^\\star \\neq 0$ exists; if $\\forall \\lambda > 0, f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u + \\lambda v^\\star)) - f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u)) = 0$, then $L(\\lambda v^\\star*) \\rightarrow -\\infty$ as $\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nBecause the pre-Softmax logits are unbounded, increasing $\\lambda$ would make the first term very large during the optimization process, but the logarithm term would not change much. In our experiments with Equation (6), we found that the noise vectors soon converged to a finite value under different regularization coefficients. \n\n\n> Moreover, if $f_{\\psi} \\circ f_{\\phi}$ contains some thresholding operations, ensuring that $f_{\\psi} \\circ f_{\\phi}$ is bounded, then the infimum of $L$ is $-\\infty$. \n\nOur specific choice of $f_{\\psi} \\circ f_{\\phi}$ is the transformer model, which takes patch embeddings as input and outputs the pre-Softmax logits. The pre-Softmax logits of a neural network can be unbounded by design. Thus as $\\lambda$ goes to infinity, the first term in Equation (6) can be unbounded and grows more rapidly than the logarithm term, this may explain why our experiment with Equation (6) converges well and get the noise vectors with the desired invariance property.\n\n> This is problematic because nothing tells a priori whether the loss function aims at ensuring $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u + v)) - f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u)) = 0$ or $\\|v\\| \\rightarrow \\infty$, and it may return a vector of large (infinite) norm that does not all satisfy $f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u + v)) - f_{\\psi}(f_{\\phi}(u)) = 0$. \n\nWe agree that our formulation in Equation (6) does not explicitly prevent a vector with an infinitely large norm that does not meet the invariance condition. We agree that \u201cit may return a vector of\u201d that property, however, we hope to remind the reviewer that our empirical findings, depicted in Fig. 2, indicate that the loss term combined with the negative logarithmic term successfully yields non-trivial noise vectors that minimally impact the model output, verified by the MSE of probability and prediction consistency metrics. This approach aligns with the goals of our exploratory study to ascertain the feasibility of learning such noise vectors.\n\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's discussion on the statistical properties of loss. We agree that loss function design can benefit more from an explicit constraint, and we have added a remark at the top of this page to note future readers. Our current formulation leads to an empirically working method, and it meets the needs of our preliminary experiment. We hope the empirical contribution of our work will not be ignored because of this.\n\n> Q. 6 Section 3 is a little bit improved but remains unclear. For example, equation (9) is between (but not included in) two independent sentences. Equation (10) is starting a sentence. I think this section would be significantly clearer if (9) and (10) were written in a whole bilevel problem.\n\nThank you for your insightful suggestion. We have modified our formulation and writing to improve the clarity of our method part.\n\n> Training loss The training loss is not explicitely mentionned in the experimental part. \"We use the $\\epsilon$-approximate nullspace noise as data augmentation to fine-tune the model.\" What loss is used to do that? More generally, it is difficult to relate the experimental part to the equations presented in the paper. This is fairly problematic: if the authors use equation (6), then Q. 4a above questions the full approach. However, if eq. (7) and (8) are used, then this is fine.\n\nThanks for your instructive comment. We have added a reference to the equation in the experiment part in Section 4. We used Equation (7) and (8) for this experiment, which are Equation (7) and (9) in the updated draft. Equation (6) was only used in the exploratory experiment in Section 2.3."

In particular, we are grateful for your recognition of the novelty of our research topic, the soundness of the proposed method, and your interest in the application scenarios of our work. Below are our responses to your questions.**\n\n\n> **W1 & Q1: Can the authors provide specific real-world examples and use cases where the concept of nullspace and nullspace noise can be applied in practice?**\n\nBelow we provide some examples about the applications of nullspace in ViTs in various societal and technological contexts.\n\n**Enhancing ViT's Resilience to Minor Noises:** This has practical implications in real-world scenarios where visual data might be subject to various types of noise, such as in low-light conditions or with low-quality sensors. Understanding and leveraging nullspace properties can enhance the robustness of ViTs in these noisy environments.\n\n**Model Patenting:** The unique nullspace property of a ViT, determined by its specific set of weights, can be used for patenting purposes. It allows the identification of a specific ViT model based on its nullspace characteristics, which can be particularly useful in legal scenarios involving intellectual property rights and model authentication.\n\n**Image Watermarking:** Nullspace noise can be used for watermarking images in a way that does not alter the output or operability of ViTs. By superimposing marks in the form of nullspace noise onto input images, users can protect their data from misuse or unauthorized redistribution. This application is particularly relevant in fields like digital media, where copyright protection is critical, and in sensitive applications like personal data security.\n\n> **W2 & Q2: The paper mentions the non-linearity in ViTs as a limitation to the exact calculation of nullspace. Could the authors discuss potential methods or approaches to address this limitation or provide more insights into the nature of this non-linearity?**\n\nThere is inherent non-linearity in ViTs due to elements like activation functions and self-attention mechanisms, posing challenges to the exact analysis on the encoder-level nullspace.  In our work, we address this through approximate nullspace computation, employing deep-learning based optimization to identify minimally impactful vectors on the model\u2019s output. This approach offers a meaningful approximation within the ViT framework, providing an understanding of the robustness of transformer models. Further research could delve into a more detailed analysis of ViTs, to study the nullspace within each layer and their cascading effect, or employ advanced optimization techniques to refine this approximation in non-linear systems."

Meanwhile, adversarial training finds perturbs that changes ouput most significantly and optmize the model to tolerate such perturb. The idea is somhow opppsite. Please justify why your method could work.**\n\nIn our approach, we identify approximate nullspace vectors, which does not alter model outputs in theory but still introduces a small error, and then we train our models to make the output the same. This is based on the assumption that a robust model should be insensitive to perturbations that do not modify the semantic content of an image. On the other hand, adversarial training identifies the perturbation that changes the output the most under a norm constraint, and then trains the model to have the same output. This is also based on the assumption that a robust model should be insensitive to small perturbations. Both methods follow the logic of making the model tolerant to additive perturbations that should not alter its predictions, so our method shows the effect of improving the adversarial robustness similar to adversarial training.\n\n> **W2: The approach could direclty applied on CNNs, though it is derived on ViT. Please check the performance on CNNs.**\n\nYes, this approach can be directly applied to CNNs as well.
