                    "value": "This paper presents an imrpovement of the fine-tuning process for pretrained flow matching models. Flow matching [Lipman et al. 2023, Liu et al. 2023, Albergo & Vanden-Eijnden 2023] is a recently introduced type of generative models that are closely connected with score-based diffusion models, but are both empirically and theoretically demonstrated to be more beneficial to train and sample from. The improved fine-tuning is called  **Sequential Flow Straightening**, inspired by the reflow technique in [Liu et al. 2023]. Both take a pretrained flow matching model -- a velocity network, functioning very similar to score network -- then retrain it with some additional specific constraints. The authors of this paper argue that the original reflow technique from [Liu et al. 2023] will accumulate high global truncation error (which is the discretization error of nummerical ODE solver for sampling process). They therefore proposed a simple fix by doing reflow not on the whole trajectory [0, 1], but on smaller augmented paths that are arguably easier to perform reflow. \n\nXingchao Liu, Chengyue Gong, and Qiang Liu.

                    "value": "* The biggest is presentation and writing of the paper. The writing feels rushed, many places are verborsed to read. Notations are inconsistent which are confusing. I will list here only some of the examples. In the background section (section 2) the authors used $x_1 \\sim \\pi_1$ to denote data and $x_0 \\sim \\pi_0$ to denote noises and their respective distribtions, but later on flip the notation. There is a notation $t'$ in Algorithm 1 which I do not understand where it comes from. The same applied to the quantity $r$ in Lemma 3.2, which is defined before and not after the result. Some part the random variable is denoted $X_t$, some $x(t)$, etc.\n\n* The main method (the only contribution of this paper) consists of only two small paragraphs in the middle of page 5. There should be more elaboration, as I do not see a clear distinction between sequential reflow and the original reflow: are they different in flow matching loss function as well, or only sampling of the trajectory part? Most other parts are just reciting existing works' results, for example I do not understand the purpose of adding Proposition 3.1, which is cited from other paper and for me do not add anything to the analysis in section 3. This leaves a question on the contribution of the paper.\n\n* Questionable benchmarks: I think the benchmark is a bit unfair as the authors do not take pretrained models and numbers from Rectified Flow paper (available freely online with CIFAR10 and CelebA-HQ at https://github.com/gnobitab/RectifiedFlow/), but instead reimplemented the methods in Jax, and do not provide their code in the Supplmentary Material. Using the same pretrained models (only differs in retraining method) with Rectified Flow paper would ensure a better comparison. in my opinion. What is more, the authors do not explicitly stated this in the main text, but instead of using CelebA with more standard resized 256x256 resolution, they trained theirs with 64x64 resolutions (only mentioned in the Appendix). This leads to a better, but misleading FID for the CelebA dataset."

(2023) not only introduced the concept of a k-rectified flow but also proposed a k-step image generator, as discussed in Appendix A. This approach bears a similarity to your proposal; however, a key distinction arises in their implementation, where $X_s = X_1$ and $X_{t_i - 1} = X_0$. I train these k-step models, using the 1-rectified model from their GitHub repository, for various values of k, specifically 4, 6, and 8. The results obtained from these models closely resemble those achieved with 4-SeqRF (+Distill), 6-SeqRF (+Distill), and 8-SeqRF (+Distill) on Cifar10. Thus, I would strongly recommend that you consider comparing your method with this approach.\n\n- What is the used ODE solver to calculate \"$\\hat{X}_{t-1}$\" in Algorithm 1. A relatively precise ODE solver takes lots of time, being a bottleneck in the training process. Is it possible to precompute \"\\hat{X}_{t-1}\"?"

How do you choose $t_0, t_1, t_2, \\dots ,t_K$ ?\n- In Fig. 5 and Fig. 8, the last row seems to be not consistent with other rows. Does a column contain images generated from the same noise? \n\n**References**:\n\n[1] Liu, Xingchao, Chengyue Gong, and Qiang Liu. \"Flow straight and fast: Learning to generate and transfer data with rectified flow.

It applies the reflow algorithm from Liu et al in time-segments to reduce the accumulating error introduced by the ODE solver, resulting in 'straighter' flows within the segments. As a result, distilling the individual segments is more accurate, and the resulting segmented flow improves over standard reflow distilled flows at the cost of a slight increase in the number of function evaluations. The method is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A."

When does it become worthwhile to apply this method?\n- Even though the distilled reflow from Liu is designed for a single NFE, Table 1 should evaluate the competing methods for NFE's of 4,6,8 as well, to compare on an iso-NFE basis."

Figure 4 indicates that the sequential straightness is distributed around the endpoints of the trajectory. Does this motivate a non-linearly spaced segmentation scheme?\n\nNits:\n1.
