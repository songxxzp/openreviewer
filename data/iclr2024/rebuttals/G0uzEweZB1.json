The first augmentation method is frequency masking and the second one is frequency mixing, where Fourier transform is used to get the amplitude of frequency. In scenarios where time-series data is scarce, FrAug shows SOTA performance and also improves the performance of most of time series forecasting model comparing to other augmentation methods."

Frequency masking is already used by SpecAugment[1] in automatic speech recognition and mixing strategy is common in computer vision such as MixUp.\n\n2. There is no theory or heuristic about how to mask or mix frequencies. For example, how to select masked frequency ratio and which frequency should be masked first? When mixing frequencies, are you averaging two frequency amplitudes without any weight? Is there any chance that randomly masked frequency would be crucial? This seems the main hole in this paper.\n\n3. Lack of evidence in claims. \n(1) Aggressive augmentation methods like cropping or warping can introduce missing values or changes in periodicity, which are not suitable for TSF models.\n(2) Data from other sources are often not useful (even if they are the same kinds of data), as the underlining dynamic systems that generate the time series data could be vastly different. \nThese statements is not proved and does not have enough reference. (1) is partly proved by a single dataset experiment but does not support the claim sufficiently."

It's interesting that FrAug does not improve in any cases with `electricity` dataset.

In TSF where accurate prediction results are required, existing temporal enhancement methods destroy fine-grained temporal relationships within time series segments, resulting in poor prediction accuracy. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a frequency domain augmentation technique called FrAug, which can maintain the semantic consistency of augmented data label pairs in prediction. The authors conduct extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets and show that FrAug can improve the prediction accuracy of TSF models even when the training dataset is small. They also demonstrate that applying FrAug during training at test time can significantly improve forecast accuracy for time series with significant distribution changes. The main contributions of this paper include a systematic study of TSF data augmentation techniques, the proposal of FrAug, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in improving prediction performance."

                    "value": "The paper applies data augmentations in the frequency domain to improve the performance of time series forecasting models. Specifically, they apply two augmentations: 1) frequency masking: where some frequencies are dropped, and 2) frequency mixing: where some frequencies are mixed. To ensure consistency, they apply the transformations to the input and the forecasting window. After applying the augmentations in some datasets for training a group of standard forecasting models, the authors demonstrate that the method improves the performance, compared to other data augmentation techniques. Moreover, they run experiments to measure the performance of the techniques under \"cold start\" setups, i.e. when little training data is available."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- My biggest concern is that the contribution of this work is very limited. Augmentations in the frequency domain for time series have been discussed before [1][2][3], but the authors did not mention any previous work on this. Thus claiming to be the \"first\" ones in this seems like an overstatement. In fact, the proposed data augmentations are very similar to previous work [3] such as the masking of frequencies.\n- The experiment setup is sound but also limited. The authors only run experiments in 8 datasets, while time series forecasting literature considers way more. For instance, M3 and M4 datasets are not present. Moreover, they only compare to 4 Data augmentation baselines.\n- The improvement is marginal. The authors do not specify whether the results correspond to the average of different runs. If that is the case, they should provide standard deviations to evaluate the significance of the results.\n- A discussion on the time overhead created by the data augmentations is lacking. I would like to see how the training time increases depending on the different data augmentations that are used.\n- The data augmentations helps especially in few-shot setups. Thus, a well-regularized model will have no gain from the introduced method.\n\n\n[1] Wen et al. \"Time Series Data Augmentation for Deep Learning: A Survey\".\n\n[2] Eyobu et al. \"Feature representation and data augmentation for human activity classification based on wearable IMU sensor data using a deep LSTM neural network\".\n\n[3] Park et al. \"SpecAugment: A simple data augmentation method for automatic speech recognition\"."

                    "value": "- Are you using the same hyperparameter value (mask rate, mix rate) for all the experiments or do you tune per time series?\n- Why does it look like the method is not working for DLinear compared to the other models?\n- Basically, this paper introduces just another hyperparameter when learning forecasting models. Why should this be included in a hyperparameter search space when there are also other regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization? Do you have any evidence that the regularization effect induced by this data augmentation is stronger than other regularization methods?"
