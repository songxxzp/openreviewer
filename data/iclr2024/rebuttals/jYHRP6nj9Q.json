The reason why the authors choose social homophily and social contagion as the two specific conditions in this paper is not clear. The author's criteria or basis for selecting these two aspects should be introduced. No explanation of the above two concepts is not provided when they first appear.  \n3. Both social homophily and social contagion are based on the assumption of network homogeneity. However, more and more works point out the heterogeneity of real-world networks, especially in social networks (e.g., Facebook and Twitter). Therefore, it is concerning whether the assumptions on which the method is based are good for social graphs.  \n4. The scalability of the proposed method is slightly unsatisfactory. As a dual conditional method, the proposed method uses the conditions between the nodes/edges to implement two specific conditional constraints through the transfer of point and edge information. It is not explored whether the model can be applied to any two constraints and how it should be extended if both conditions are at the node level (independent of edges).  \n5. Figure 2 should be improved for more clarity with some explanations either in the figure or in the caption.  \n6. The ablation studies of each condition and loss are missing."

                        "value": "**Q1 and Q2**: The motivation and importance of a dual conditional diffusion model, the reason why not more than two conditions, and the explanation of social homophily and social contagion.\n\n**Response**:  The generation of dual conditional social graphs is highly valuable for social applications, as these applications often require the consideration of users' diverse social contexts and connections, which typically satisfy more than one condition in real-world applications. Moreover, they should also retain the unique characteristics of social graphs, i.e., social homophily and social contagion, to ensure that the phenomena inherent in social applications can be captured. Social homophily [6], which involves the tendency to form social connections with people who share similar profiles, plays a significant role as a primary factor in link formation [1]. On the other hand, social contagion [7,8], where behavior spontaneously spreads through a social graph, is largely influenced by network topology [2]. Since homophily and contagion are generally intertwined [3], many studies often simultaneously consider both to facilitate social applications. For instance, Li et al. [4] explore the effects of social homophily and contagion on users' behavior for social recommendation. Sankar et al. [5] leverage social homophily and contagion to accurately predict the spread of information.\n\nIn downstream applications like social marketing, it is common to select individuals with strong influence within their social circles for word-of-mouth promotion. These social circles are parts of users' ego social graphs, preserving the essential characteristics of social homophily and social contagion to accurately capture social influence propagation. Specifically, for luxury golf club brands targeting golf enthusiasts and high-income individuals, analyzing users' influence within social circles that include friends sharing a passion for golf and possessing high incomes can help identify individuals well-suited for promoting the brands. Similarly, in link prediction, recommending friends with similar social circles is fundamental. Therefore, focusing on users' social circles characterized by a shared interest in birdwatching and frequent visits to locations in Japan ensures precise recommendations of friends involved in birdwatching within Japan.\n\nAdditionally, we agree that a multi-conditional model is expected to be more general and applicable to a broader range of social applications. We provide the method of extending CDGraph to support additional conditions as follows; however, due to time constraints, the implementation of such extensions is deferred to future work.\n\nTo support more than two conditions, we need to modify the probability distribution of the reverse process by augmenting the node embeddings $\\mathbf{X_{c_i}}$ to indicate the satisfaction of the conditions. And the probability distribution of the classification guidance model can be modified by additionally considering the dependency between the conditions.\nWe noticed that Eq. (6) can be extended by adding more feature matrices of node conditions, which can be written as follows.\n$$\np_{\\theta} ( \\lbrace \\mathbf{X}_{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)} | \\lbrace \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}) = \\prod _{i=1}^{K} p _{\\theta} (\\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} | \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t)}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}) p _{\\theta} (\\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)} | \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}, \\lbrace \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}),\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the number of specified conditions.\nOn the other hand, the dual-conditional classification guidance model can also be extended by specifying more conditions as follows:\n$$\nq (G_C^{(t-1)} | G_C^{(t)}, \\lbrace c_i \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}) \\propto q(c_i | G_C^{(t-1)}, \\lbrace c_j \\rbrace _{j \\neq i}) \\prod _{j \\neq i} q (c_j | G_C^{(t-1)}) q (G_C^{(t-1)} | G_C^{(t)})\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the number of specified conditions, and $\\lbrace c_j \\rbrace _{j \\neq i}$ are conditions dependent with $c_i$."

                        "value": "**Q3**: The assumptions of network homogeneity/heterogeneity.\n\n**Response**: Network homogeneity (or heterogeneity) generally refers to the degree of similarity (or dissimilarity) among users in a social graph. Social homophily and social contagion are widespread phenomena on social graphs, irrespective of whether the graph exhibits homogeneity or heterogeneity. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that network heterogeneity is observed in real-world social networks, indicating that users can also become friends with others with diverse profiles. It is important to note that CDGraph is currently in its early stages and is primarily focusing on fundamental social homophily and social contagion. In the future, we can aim to support a more diverse range of social phenomena by modifying the co-evolution dependency module and introducing an additional distribution to capture the heterogeneity. \n\n**Q4**: Scalability of the proposed method to any two constraints and how to extend if both conditions are at the node level.\n\n**Response**: We agree with the reviewer regarding the significance of scalability in accommodating any two conditions at various levels, whether at the node, edge, or a combination of both. In the context of this study, CDGraph is designed to produce dual conditional social graphs, with both conditions applied at the node level. In our current work, CDGraph focuses on generating dual conditional social graphs, with both conditions applied at the node level. Acknowledging the importance of the reviewer's suggestion, we plan to extend the dual conditional classifier module to provide flexibility in supporting conditions at any level. This improvement will be incorporated into the final manuscript.\n\n**Q5**: Explanations regarding Figure 2 (in the original paper) with a detailed explanation of the workflow of CDGraph. \n\n**Response**:  The workflow of CDGraph is updated in Figure 2 of the revised paper (previously Figure 3 in the original paper), and we provide the detailed explanation as follows: The forward noising processes of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{1}}}^{(t)}$, $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and $\\mathbf{X_{c_{2}}}^{(t)}$ are illustrated from above to below, and each $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)} (i=1,2)$ has dependency with $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$. The red bending arrow represents the conditional probability distribution $q(\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{E}^{(t)})$ of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and the black bending arrow represents the conditional probability distribution $q(\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)})$ of $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}$.\n\nOn the other hand, the reverse denoising processes of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{1}}}^{(t)}$, $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and $\\mathbf{X_{c_{2}}}^{(t)}$ are illustrated from above to below, and the blue arrow represents the co-evolution based on social contagion; the red arrow represents the co-evolution based on social homophily.\n\nThe illustrations of social homophily and social contagion are updated in Figure 3 of the revised paper (previously Figure 2 in the original paper), and we provide a detailed explanation as follows: The social homophily-based coevolution aims to denoise edge embeddings from given node embeddings of each condition (as stated in Eq. (7)); the social contagion-based co-evolution aims to denoise node embeddings of each condition from given edge embeddings (as stated in Eq. (9)).\n\n**Q6**: Ablation study.\n\n**Response**: We apologize that the results of the ablation study could not be produced within the time limit because the interdependence among modules is complex, and removing the implementation of each module requires a bit more time. We plan to introduce three variants of CDGraph: CDGraph-coevolve, CDGraph-class, and CDGraph-plain. CDGraph-coevolve removes the co-evolution dependency module in the reverse denoising process, CDGraph-class discards the dual conditional classifier module in the reverse denoising process, while CDGraph-plain omits both modules. The ablation study will be included in the final manuscript."

Specifically, a pre-trained classifier $f$ learns the distribution $p(c_{i}|G^{(t)})$ for a graph classification problem $c_{i} \\approx f(G^{(t)})$ in each step $t$ of the denoising process (as shown by the brown arrow in Fig. 2(b)) so that the denoised graphs can be predicted to have the specified condition $c_{i}$, which can be derived by Bayesian Theorem. As there is one additional condition $c_{j}$ to be considered, we need to consider a conditional probability distribution $p(c_{j}|G^{(t)}, c_{i})$ to further guide the denoising process to meet the second condition given that the first condition is satisfied.\n\n**Q2**: Explanation regarding the comparisons with DDPM.\n\n**Response**: According to [1], there are two types of DDPMs: continuous and discrete. Since continuous DDPMs may hurt the graph sparsity, and the structural information of noisy graphs in the diffusion process may be lost [2], we opt for discrete DDPMs as our baselines (i.e., DiGress and EDGE), rather than continuous DDPMs.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Wenqi Fan, et al. \"Generative diffusion models on graphs: Methods and applications.\" IJCAI, 2023.\n\n[2] C.

                        "value": "**W1**: Motivation for the model design.\n\n**Response**: The generation of dual conditional social graphs is highly valuable for social applications, as these applications often require the consideration of users' diverse social contexts and connections, which typically satisfy more than one condition in real-world applications. Moreover, they should also retain the unique characteristics of social graphs, i.e., social homophily and social contagion, to ensure that the phenomena inherent in social applications can be captured. Social homophily [9], which involves the tendency to form social connections with people who share similar profiles, plays a significant role as a primary factor in link formation [4]. On the other hand, social contagion [10, 11], where behavior spontaneously spreads through a social graph, is largely influenced by network topology [5]. Since homophily and contagion are generally intertwined [6], many studies often simultaneously consider both to facilitate social applications. For instance, Li et al. [7] explore the effects of social homophily and contagion on users' behavior for social recommendation. Sankar et al. [8] leverage social homophily and contagion to accurately predict the spread of information.\n\nIn social applications like social marketing, it is common to select individuals with strong influence within their social circles for word-of-mouth promotion. These social circles are parts of users' ego social graphs, preserving the essential characteristics of social homophily and social contagion to accurately capture social influence propagation. Specifically, for luxury golf club brands targeting golf enthusiasts and high-income individuals, analyzing users' influence within social circles that include friends sharing a passion for golf and possessing high incomes can help identify individuals well-suited for promoting the brands. Similarly, in link prediction, recommending friends with similar social circles is fundamental. Therefore, focusing on users' social circles characterized by a shared interest in birdwatching and frequent visits to locations in Japan ensures precise recommendations of friends involved in birdwatching within Japan.\n\n**W2**: Detailed explanation of the workflow of CDGraph. \n\n**Response**:  The workflow of CDGraph is updated in Figure 2 of the revised paper (previously Figure 3 in the original paper), and we provide the detailed explanation as follows: The forward noising processes of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{1}}}^{(t)}$, $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and $\\mathbf{X_{c_{2}}}^{(t)}$ are illustrated from above to below, and each $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)} (i=1,2)$ has dependency with $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$. The red bending arrow represents the conditional probability distribution $q(\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{E}^{(t)})$ of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and the black bending arrow represents the conditional probability distribution $q(\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)})$ of $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}$.\n\nOn the other hand, the reverse denoising processes of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{1}}}^{(t)}$, $\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$, and $\\mathbf{X_{c_{2}}}^{(t)}$ are illustrated from above to below, and the blue arrow represents the co-evolution based on social contagion; the red arrow represents the co-evolution based on social homophily.\n\nThe illustrations of social homophily and social contagion are updated in Figure 3 of the revised paper (previously Figure 2 in the original paper), and we provide a detailed explanation as follows: The social homophily-based coevolution aims to denoise edge embeddings from given node embeddings of each condition (as stated in Eq. (7)); the social contagion-based co-evolution aims to denoise node embeddings of each condition from given edge embeddings (as stated in Eq. (9))."

In addition to the original metrics, including validity and discrepancy with the input graphs (i.e., relative error ratios of #node, #edges, and density, as well as MMD of clustering coefficients), we further consider two homophily metrics, including assortativity and EI homophily index, to evaluate discrepancy with the input graphs. Note that both assortativity and the EI homophily index are presented using relative error ratios. Assume that there are two attributes associated with each node, and each node has a binary value (0/1) for each attribute. A homo-edge is an edge where the end nodes share the same value for every attribute, whereas a hetero-edge is an edge where the end nodes differ in values for at least one attribute.\n* Assortativity [2]: The ratio of the number of homo-edges $|E_{homo}|$ to the number of edges $|E|$ in the whole graph:  $$r=\\frac{|E_{homo}|}{|E|}.$$\n\n* EI homophily index [3]: The ratio of the difference between the number of hetero-edges $|E_{hetero}|$ and the number of homo-edges $|E_{homo}|$ to to the number of edges $|E|$ in the whole graph: \n\\begin{equation*}\nEI=\\frac{|E_{hetero}|-|E_{homo}|}{|E|}.\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe results are presented in the following table. For validity, compared to diffusion-based and deep generative models, RW cannot simultaneously meet the conditions since it only focuses on structural information. Regarding the discrepancy with the input graphs, those generated by RW typically exhibit the largest disparity because RW lacks global awareness and is highly influenced by biases in local structure. Concerning homophily, RW yields high relative error ratios of assortativity and EI homophily index since it neglects the attributes of nodes when generating graphs.\n| Metric   | Validity | Node     | Edge   | Density | Clust. coeff. | Assortativity | EI homophily index |\n|----------|----------|----------|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| RW       | 0        | 5.170    | 8.225  | 0.698   | 0.242         | 0.351         | 1.437             |\n| SPECTRE  | 0.276    | _0.110_| 1.113  | 0.439   | 0.288         | 0.042         | 0.172             |\n| GSM      | 0.274    | 0.147    | _0.677_ | 0.457 | 0.031         | 0.043         | 0.175             |\n| EDGE     | 0.307    | 0.897    | 2.424  | 0.926   | _0.03_      |  **0.006**     | **0.025**             |\n| DiGress  | _0.375_| __0.002__| 0.725  | _0.297_| 0.259         | 0.067         | 0.275             |\n| CDGraph  | __1__    | 0.149    | __0.186__| __0.002__ | __0.022__   | _0.013_         | _0.052_             |"

Although the baselines are not designed to control the generation process to meet the two conditions, we extend them to support graphs with nodes having two attributes as input and capable of generating graphs with nodes having two attributes. Through the evaluation of validity, we can conclude that, for baselines other than DiGress, as they do not consider meeting both conditions during generation, even if they learn from graphs with nodes having two attributes, they cannot guarantee the generation of graphs meeting both conditions. While DiGress is also extended to support two conditions, it cannot achieve high validity, indicating the need to design new methods to generate graphs that can meet both conditions."

(7)); the social contagion-based co-evolution aims to denoise node embeddings of each condition from given edge embeddings (as stated in Eq. (9)).\n\n**W3**: Detailed reasons of the suboptimality of relative error ratios of #nodes and clustering coefficient on the BlogCatalog data set\n\n**Response**: Though the number of nodes in generated graphs is sampled by empirical distribution in CDGraph and GSM, which may result in slight suboptimality of CDGraph\u2019s relative error ratio of #nodes. Nevertheless, density refers to the ratio of the number of edges to the maximum possible number of edges (which is related to the square of the number of nodes) in a graph. Hence, it is more comprehensive to simultaneously examine the relative error ratios of nodes, edges, and density. In CDGraph, the relative error ratios for both edges and density are much lower than GSM since GSM does not aim to optimize the structure discrepancy. Overall, the structure of the graphs generated by CDGraph remains very close to that of the input graphs.\n\nOn the other hand, the MMD of clustering coefficients of EDGE slightly outperforms CDGraph on BlogCatalog since EDGE focuses on the guidance of degree changes, leading to smaller differences in the clustering coefficient between input graphs and generated graphs.\n\n**W4**: Limitations and broader impacts of CDGraph.\n\n**Response**: The limitations and broader impacts are presented as follows. \n* Limitations: Currently, we focus on conditional graph generation by specifying two (node-level) conditions, and we will further generalize the case of graph generation with more than two conditions, in which the conditions involve those of edge-level or pattern-level.\n* Broader impacts:  CDGraph can generate social graphs for downstream analysis, such as social influence analysis and link prediction (friend recommendation)."

Existing methods, such as statistical sampling and deep generative models, have limitations in capturing dependencies across dual conditions and accounting for social homophily and social contagion phenomena in conditional social graphs. This paper introduces a novel conditional graph generative model *CDGraph*, exploiting co-evolution dependency to guide the diffusion process to capture the dependencies between the node and edge conditions, solving the problem of the limitation of social homophily and social contagion. Furthermore, the authors propose a dual conditional classifier to guide the sampling process to fulfill dual conditions while capturing the correlation between the specified conditions. The paper conducts extensive experiments on real-world networks and evaluates the performance on validity and error discrepancies of the generated graphs compared to the input graphs. Results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under different correlations among specified conditions."

What is the meaning of \"E is a one-hot encoding vector representing whether **an edge** between v_n and v_m in GC **satisfies condition c**\"?\n\n- The formulation in equation 5 does not seem to contribute to the method's design. What is the motivation for introducing the formulation?  \n\n- As the number of dimensions needs to be specified in the input of the diffusion reverse process, the number of nodes should be a human-specified parameter, which does not seem proper to be a metric for evaluating the performance.\n\n- The proposed method does not seem to be applicable to graphs with more than 2 conditions.

(Suppose $N$ is the number of nodes in a graph $G$.)\n* The one-hot encoding of nodes indicating the satisfaction of condition $c_{i}$: $\\mathbf{X} _{c_i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 2}$.\n* The one-hot encoding of edges: $\\mathbf{E} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N \\times 2}$.\n* The transition matrix for $\\mathbf{X_{c_i}}$: $\\mathbf{Q}_{X _{c_i}}^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$\n* The transition matrix for $\\mathbf{E}$: $\\mathbf{Q}_{E}^{(t)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$\n\nBesides, we fix the typo and clarify that $\\mathbf{E}$ is a one-hot encoding vector representing whether there is an edge between $v_n$ and $v_m$ in the definition of the conditional indication graph. \n\nHowever, according to previous works [1, 2], the number of nodes in the generated graph is drawn from an empirical distribution rather than specified by user input, thus becoming an indicator of whether the generated graph can effectively mimic the original graph.   \n\n**Q2**: Motivation for introducing the formulation in Eq. (5).\n\n**Response**: The two equations formulated in Eq. (5) state the forward process of the nodes and edges respectively, in which the dependencies between nodes and edges are captured by the second term in both equations, and the first term in the first (second) equation models the forward processes of $\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{X_{c_i}}^{(t-1)}$ and $\\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)}$ ($\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}$ given $\\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)}$ and $\\mathbf{X_{c_i}}^{(t-1)}$). However, due to the Markovian property of $q$, we have: \n$$q(\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t-1)}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)})=q(\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t-1)}); q(\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{X_{c_{i}}}^{(t-1)}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)})=q(\\mathbf{E}^{(t)}|\\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)})$$\n\n**Q4**: Future direction for CDGraph to support more than two conditions.\n\n**Response**: To support more than two conditions, we need to modify the probability distribution of the reverse process by augmenting the node embeddings $\\mathbf{X_{c_i}}$ to indicate the satisfaction of the conditions. And the probability distribution of the classification guidance model can be modified by additionally considering the dependency between the conditions.\nWe noticed that Eq. (6) can be extended by adding more feature matrices of node conditions, which can be written as follows.\n$$\np_{\\theta} ( \\lbrace \\mathbf{X}_{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)} | \\lbrace \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}) = \\prod _{i=1}^{K} p _{\\theta} (\\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} | \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t)}, \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}) p _{\\theta} (\\mathbf{E}^{(t-1)} | \\mathbf{E}^{(t)}, \\lbrace \\mathbf{X} _{c_i}^{(t-1)} \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}),\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the number of specified conditions.\nOn the other hand, the dual-conditional classification guidance model can also be extended by specifying more conditions as follows:\n$$\nq (G_C^{(t-1)} | G_C^{(t)}, \\lbrace c_i \\rbrace _{i=1}^{K}) \\propto q(c_i | G_C^{(t-1)}, \\lbrace c_j \\rbrace _{j \\neq i}) \\prod _{j \\neq i} q (c_j | G_C^{(t-1)}) q (G_C^{(t-1)} | G_C^{(t)})\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the number of specified conditions, and $\\lbrace c_j \\rbrace _{j \\neq i}$ are conditions dependent with $c_i$.\n\n**Q5**: Explanation of the performance of CDGraph\u2019s density metric on the Twitter dataset.\n\n**Response**: We are sorry that we got the data wrong. The correct relative error ratio of density in each method is listed as follows:\n* GSM: 0.4580\n* SPECTRE: 0.4410\n* EDGE: 0.0531\n* DiGress: 0.0840\n* CDGraph: 0.2009\n\nThe relative error ratio of density in EDGE and DiGress is lower than in CDGraph since EDGE focuses on guiding degree changes, and DiGress attempts to preserve graph sparsity in the diffusion process. Nevertheless, density refers to the ratio of the number of edges to the maximum possible number of edges (which is related to the square of the number of nodes) in a graph. Hence, it is more comprehensive to simultaneously examine the relative error ratios of nodes, edges, and density. In CDGraph, the relative error ratios for both nodes and edges are less than 0.05. Overall, the structure of the graphs generated by CDGraph remains very close to that of the input graphs."

                        "value": "**W1**: The justification of the need of dual-conditional social graphs (and the downstream scenarios).\n\n**Response**: The generation of dual conditional social graphs is highly valuable for social applications, as these applications often require the consideration of users' diverse social contexts and connections, which typically satisfy more than one condition in real-world applications. Moreover, they should also retain the unique characteristics of social graphs, i.e., social homophily and social contagion, to ensure that the phenomena inherent in social applications can be captured. Social homophily [6], which involves the tendency to form social connections with people who share similar profiles, plays a significant role as a primary factor in link formation [1]. On the other hand, social contagion [7,8], where behavior spontaneously spreads through a social graph, is largely influenced by network topology [2]. Since homophily and contagion are generally intertwined [3], many studies often simultaneously consider both to facilitate social applications. For instance, Li et al. [4] explore the effects of social homophily and contagion on users' behavior for social recommendation. Sankar et al. [5] leverage social homophily and contagion to accurately predict the spread of information.\n\nFor downstream scenarios like social marketing, it is common to select individuals with strong influence within their social circles for word-of-mouth promotion. These social circles are parts of users' ego social graphs, preserving the essential characteristics of social homophily and social contagion to accurately capture social influence propagation. Specifically, for luxury golf club brands targeting golf enthusiasts and high-income individuals, analyzing users' influence within social circles that include friends sharing a passion for golf and possessing high incomes can help identify individuals well-suited for promoting the brands. Similarly, in link prediction, recommending friends with similar social circles is fundamental. Therefore, focusing on users' social circles characterized by a shared interest in birdwatching and frequent visits to locations in Japan ensures precise recommendations of friends involved in birdwatching within Japan.\n\n**W2**: More metrics and evaluations.\n\n**Response**: We conduct additional experiments for evaluation with assortativity [9] and EI homophily index [10], detailed as follows. Note that to demonstrate the discrepancy with the input graphs, these metrics are presented using relative error ratios.  Assume that there are two attributes associated with each node, and each node has a binary value (0/1) for each attribute. A homo-edge is an edge where the end nodes share the same value for every attribute, whereas a hetero-edge is an edge where the end nodes differ in values for at least one attribute.\n* Assortativity [9]: The ratio of the number of homo-edges $|E_{homo}|$ to the number of edges $|E|$ in the whole graph:  $$r=\\frac{|E_{homo}|}{|E|}.$$\n* EI homophily index [10]: The ratio of the difference between the number of hetero-edges $|E_{hetero}|$ and the number of homo-edges $|E_{homo}|$ to to the number of edges $|E|$ in the whole graph: \n\\begin{equation*}\nEI=\\frac{|E_{hetero}|-|E_{homo}|}{|E|}.\n\\end{equation*}\n\nThe results are presented in the table below. For both assortativity and the EI homophily index, CDGraph obtains the second-lowest relative error ratios, indicating the effectiveness of the design based on social homophily and social contagion co-evolution. It's worth noting that EDGE achieves the lowest relative error ratios, as its generation process is guided by nodes' degrees, which may implicitly learn associations with node attributes from the input graphs. Despite EDGE performing well in homophily discrepancy, its validity is significantly lower than that of CDGraph, indicating that it still cannot generate appropriate dual conditional social graphs. Other baselines, lacking specific consideration for the relationship between structure and attributes, exhibit higher relative error ratios.\n\n|            | Assortativity | EI homophily index |\n|------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| RW         | 0.351         | 1.437              |\n| SPECTRE    | 0.042         | 0.172              |\n| GSM        | 0.043         | 0.175              |\n| EDGE       | **0.006**     | **0.025**          |\n| DiGress    | 0.067         | 0.275              |\n| CDGraph    | _0.013_         | _0.052_              |"

                        "value": "**W3**: Denoising network parameterization.\n\n**Response**: We provide the architecture of the denoising network and elaborate the details as follows. Following DiGress [11], we construct a Graph Transformer by first extracting graph-theoretic (structural and spectral) features from node and edge embeddings and then updating the embeddings of nodes and edges, as well as graph-level features through graph transformer layers, each of which consists of a self-attention module. We extend the architecture of Graph Transformer employed in DiGress by augmenting the node embeddings since nodes in the condition indication graph are associated with two conditions (there is a 1-hot encoding for each condition). The graph-theoretic features are extracted by following the way in DiGress.\n\n**W4**: Ablation study.\n\n**Response**: We apologize that the results of the ablation study could not be produced within the time limit because the interdependence among modules is complex, and removing the implementation of each module requires a bit more time. We plan to introduce three variants of CDGraph: CDGraph-coevolve, CDGraph-class, and CDGraph-plain. CDGraph-coevolve removes the co-evolution dependency module in the reverse denoising process, CDGraph-class discards the dual conditional classifier module in the reverse denoising process, while CDGraph-plain omits both modules. The ablation study will be included in the final manuscript. \n\n**W5**: Calculations of the evaluation metrics.\n\n**Response**: The definitions of the metrics are stated as follows: \n* Validity (the higher, the better): Suppose $D= \\lbrace G_1,...,G_n \\rbrace$ is the set of graphs generated by a graph generation algorithm. Let $D_{val}= \\lbrace G_i \\in D|r_{c_1,c_2}(G_{i}) \\geq 0.5 \\rbrace$ denote the set of valid graphs in $D$, where $r_{c_1,c_2}(G_{i})$ is the ratio of the nodes in $G_{i}$ satisfying the specified conditions $c_1$ and $c_2$. The validity is calculated as follows:\n$$Validity = |D_{val}|/|D|$$\n* Relative error ratios (the lower, the better): Suppose $D= \\lbrace G_1,...,G_n \\rbrace$ is the set of original input graphs and $\\hat{D}= \\lbrace \\hat{G}_1,...,\\hat{G}_n \\rbrace$ is the set of graphs generated by a graph generator based on $D$. The relative error ratio regarding a graph metric $m$ (e.g., average #nodes and #edges, average density) is calculated by: $m(\\hat{G})/m(G)$.\n* MMD (maximum mean discrepancy; the lower, the better): Suppose $G$ is the original input graph and $\\hat{G}$ is the generated graph. The MMD between $G$ and $\\hat{G}$ is calculated by the difference between their graph metric distribution $f(G)$ and $f(\\hat{G})$, where $f$ can be the degree distribution, local clustering coefficient distribution, etc."
