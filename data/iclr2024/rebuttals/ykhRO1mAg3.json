FPTQ establishes the practicality of W4A8 quantization for deploying large language models.\n\nThe paper underscores the significance of W4 \u2192 W8 dequantization for acceleration through INT8-GEMM in the summarization phase. Furthermore, it highlights the potential adoption of W4A8 in the weight-only quant kernel during the generation phase, emphasizing the preference for INT8-GEMM over FP16-GEMM."

                        "value": "$\\textbf{Q1:}$  Degradation of the MMLU score and comparison with LLM-QAT.\n\n$\\textbf{A1:}$ Indeed, there is an observable degradation of the MMLU score. Considering we apply a more aggressive quantization (W4A8), a certain degree of performance degradation is reasonable and expected. A more severe degradation is seen in LLM-QAT. We quote their reported MMLU scores (in their Appendix) here for a fair comparison. Note under the same bit width setting W4A8, our PTQ method FPTQ outperforms their costly QAT method by a clear margin.\n\n| Method | Model  | Humanities | STEM | Social Sciences |  Other | Average | \n|:------: | :------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|\n| LLM-QAT | LLaMA-1-7B | 30.0 |27.4 |28.4 |34.2 |30.0|\n| FPTQ | LLaMA-1-7B | **30.20** |  **29.95**  | **32.76** |  **35.87** |  **32.02**  | \n| LLM-QAT | LLaMA-1-13B |38.7 |32.8| 47.1 |47.7 |41.2 | \n| FPTQ | LLaMA-1-13B |**40.96**  | **34.19**  | **49.72**  | **49.75** |  **43.46** | \n\n*Table v. Comparison with LLM-QAT W4A8 on MMLU*\n\nIt's important to highlight that our MMLU scores are very close to those achieved with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization. We believe this is a testament to the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, it's worth noting that existing methods can experience significant performance drops even with W8A8 or W4A16 quantization on some sensitive models. The trade-off here is the significantly improved computational efficiency, which is a key goal of our work.\n\n$\\textbf{Q2:}$ Significance of fine-grained quantization.\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ We concur with your viewpoint that the observed inference characteristics could be applicable to a broad range of quantization papers utilizing W4A8. Nonetheless, our emphasis on fine-grained quantization stems from its unique implementation in our work and its contribution to the overall effectiveness of our approach. We would like to underscore that while fine-grained quantization can help reduce accuracy loss (see also $\\textbf{A1}$ to Reviewer yeXC), it can potentially lead to a significant decrease in inference speed as well (see also Analysis on computation efficiency in Section 6). \n\n$\\textbf{Q3:}$ The selection v0 and v1 and their sensitivy.  \n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ They are empirical values, see also $\\textbf{A3}$ to Reviewer WDjT. Note that v0 and v1 serve as a ruler to select which layers require advanced quantization techniques. According to our statistical analysis over a large body of LLMs, the two numbers can be mostly kept the same.\n\n$\\textbf{Q4:}$ Cost of context-decoding stage.\n\n$\\textbf{A4:}$ Type conversion does add extra cost but it also depends on the implementation. We have revised Figure 2 (b) for a more accurate depiction.\n\n$\\textbf{Q5:}$ How to determine clipping value when employing activation static quantization?\n\n$\\textbf{A5:}$ In our experiments, we don't apply clipping for activation. As for LAE in Eq.1, we use min/max for smoothing. \n\n\n$\\textbf{Q6:}$ Has KV cache quantization be implemented?\n\n$\\textbf{A6:}$ Yes, we apply the KV cache as a reusable buffer to save the per-tensor static quantization result of KV\u2019s activations.\n\n$\\textbf{Minors}$\n\nTypos are fixed, see also our common response."

The proposed method chooses the quantization scaling factor based on a log function of the max activations solely, i.e. as opposed to using both activations and weights in SmoothQuant. This method will be applied only when the range of activations of a given layer is between 15 and 150, above which the quantization scheme will fallback to per-token dynamic approach. The author then demonstrated the proposed method using W4A8 (INT4 and INT8) quantization settings and benchmarked with W8A8 (using SmoothQuant) and W4A16 (GPTQ FP16 matrix multiplication), showing comparable accuracy. The author argues that W4A8 would be a better combination than the other two cases, as the compute-intense stage in LLM could benefit from INT computations and the memory-bound stage in LLM could still enjoy the reduced communication due to INT4 weights."

                    "value": "1. Novelty. The proposed method is very similar to SmoothQuant, main difference is the formula to calculate the scaling factor. Not only it seems like a variation from SmoothQuant, but it didn't show enough proofs that the proposed formula is superior than the original one. For example, the author doesn't show any W4A8 SmoothQuant results and contrast with the \"failed SmoothQuant.\" \n\n2. Unsupported claims. For example, it seems like the author didn't implement the W4A8 INT kernels for a real inference speed test, which makes Fig 2b a speculation rather than real data (which would be ok). However, this plot doesn't seem to be reasonable. If W4A8 is using the same 8bit INT GEMM engine as W8A8, it would require some additional conversion for W4 to W8 (similar for W4A16 case.) That means under compute-bound assumption, the best the \"blue box\" could do would be very close to W8A8, assuming the conversion overhead can be nicely overlapped with computation. Similar for the memory-bound portion compared to W4A16. This plot seems to exaggerate the benefit of W4A8 without solid support."

If SmoothQuant doesn't perform well, was it because the scaling factors or was it the layers need to be treated in the same way as in FPTQ, such that some FC2s are using dynamic per-token settings? And how was v0 and v1 chosen? What's the impact of those parameters? As a quantization method paper, these details would help the readers to build better understanding about the proposed method.\n\n2. The two main claims of this work are a) W4A8 with outlier treatment can work and b) W4A8 can bring new benefit in terms of inference speed. Considering there are a few works trying to tackle the same issue at even lower precisions, e.g. OmniQuant and QLLM shows W4A4 results, together with all the W8A8 works and W4A16 works..., if the second claim can be demonstrated with real hardware results, it would make this paper much stronger. If the author has any progress and results on that front and willing to share, please consider to add them to the manuscript."

A vanilla SmoothQuant W4A8 is much inferior. In contrast, our proposed FPTQ substantially resolves the degradation in the W4A8 setting.

Especially, it's known that naive W4A8 method degrade model performance significantly. The authors use group-wise quantization for the model weights, and Logarithmic Activation Equalization (LAE) for the activations. In particular, it is challenging to quantize activations, and the authors use different strategies on different kinds of layers based on the statistics observed. For those strategy selections, the proposed method uses some calibration datasets. As a result, the author could achieve comparable quantization performance with W4A8. The authors show this on various LLMs including BLOOM, LLaMA and LLaMA2 on different tasks including MMLU, commonsense QA and etc."

                        "value": "$\\textbf{Q1:}$ Inference speed and expensive operations.\n\n$\\textbf{A1:}$  In this paper, we are primarily concerned with the theoretical upper-bound of inference time in W4A8 bit widths. The real inference speed, however, largely depends on the specific hardware support (GPU, CPU, FPGA, etc.) and the amount of engineering effort put into implementations.\n\n**Costly operations.** Below we provide an end-to-end performance comparison of per-token dynamic quantization and per-tensor quantization under the W8A8 setting. Notice that per-token dynamic quantization adds extra overhead that ranges from 5% to 10%.\n\n|Batch size |  input length | output length | FP16 |  W8A8 Per-tensor  |  W8A8 Per-token |\n| :---: | :----:| :---:| :----:| :----:| :----:|\n|1   | 1024  | 128 | 1772ms      | 1331 (1.33x)   | 1406 (1.26x) |\n|4   | 1024  | 128  |  2003ms    | 1519 (1.32x)    |  1589 (1.26x) |\n|16   |  1024  | 128  | 3163ms      | 2448 (1.29x)   | 2634 (1.20x) |\n|32   |  1024  | 128  | 4998ms      | 4013 (1.25x)   | 4492 (1.12x) |\n\n*Table i. Latency of LLaMA2-13b tested on a A100 80G GPU*\n\n\n$\\textbf{Q2:}$ The degradation is shown on MMLU.\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ It is expected that the degradation increases as we chase narrower bit widths. Noticeably, we've updated LLM-QAT W4A8 results in Table 4 while FPTQ generally prevails over it. This attests that FPTQ is a strong PTQ method that even outperforms the QAT method.  Nonetheless, the majority of our MMLU results are comparable to or better than W8A8 and W4A16, There are orthogonal ways such as weight-clipping, GPTQ, distillation, or applying better calibration data to mitigate this quantization gap, however, it is not the key focus of this paper. We maintain the current settings for a fair comparison.\n\n\n$\\textbf{Q3:}$ On how v0 and v1 is selected.\n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ The values of v0 and v1 (recommended as 15 and 150) were determined empirically. We discover that per-tensor activation quantization already generates low MSE for the range (0, v0). While for (v0, v1) it calls for LAE to smooth the range first before per-tensor quantization to have an acceptable MSE. For intractable layers like FC2 that go far beyond v1, we resort to per-token quantization. According to activation distributions over a large body of LLMs in Table ii (also see Fig.5 - Fig 10 in the appendix), this selects QKV, and FC1 for LAE before per-tensor quantization, while keeping the Dense layer untouched.\n\n| Model | QKV | Dense | FC1 | FC2 |\n| :---: | :----:| :---:| :----:| :----:| \n| | min/max| min/max| min/max | min/max | min/max |\n|OPT-66B| 3.2871 / 94.87 | 0.0581/16.45 | 3.3223 / 94.81 |  0.1580 / 34.00 |\n|BLOOM-176B| 1.7451 / 97.31 | 0.0972 / 17.07 | 3.9922 / 119.81 | 0.1636 / 71.00 |\n|GLM-130B | 2.7188 / 115.12 | 0.2861 / 19.39 | 3.3125 / 124.56 | 0.5513 / 5476 |\n|LLaMA-65B | 0.4927 / 22.51 | 0.0518 / 17.40 | 0.2856 / 27.07 | 0.0485 / 887.50 |\n\n*Table ii.
