The dataset studied is based on SARS type diseases (e.g. flu and COVID-19), and consists of sociodemographic and behavioural data from anomalous ICDs and ICPCs, located in Recife, northeast Brazil, from April 26 2020 to March 7 2021. The model is used to study the dynamics of the disease spread and identify the most important factors for the spread of the disease. The use of genetic algorithms is shown to be effective in optimising the parameters of the model, giving better predictive results."

Moreover, modeling these parameters as time-varying further exacerbates the challenge of estimation from scarce data. The authors should discuss the uncertainty in fitted parameter values and provide sensitivity analysis.\n2. Limited Novelty. The authors apply a standard genetic algorithm approach for parameter estimation. While computationally fitting an extended SEIR model is non-trivial, the optimization methodology itself does not represent a significant novel contribution. More justification is needed on the novelty of the parameter estimation technique.\n3. Unvalidated Estimates. The authors estimate under-reporting rates for infections, but it is unclear how these proposed values were validated. Further analysis should be provided to support the assumed levels of under-reporting across different model compartments."

Genetic algorithms (and other optimization methods) have been widely used in parameter learning/optimization for epidemiological models.\n- The paper does not establish the novelty or the necessity of the SEPAI3R3O model modification. There are no experiments comparing the model to existing models. Without a clear distinction of how SEPAI3R3O provides substantial improvements over existing models on well-motivated experiments, the contribution seems incremental. The authors must provide a comparison with other existing models to validate the improvements that SEPAI3R3O claims to offer. This could be done by demonstrating the model's performance against other models on the same dataset or showing how the additional compartments in SEPAI3R3O lead to significantly better understanding or prediction of disease spread.\n- The paper is not well-written and missing a lot of details/definitions. At the end of the day, every paper should be self-sufficient to an extent for the reader. The paper doesn\u2019t clearly mention what the data is, how the data is transformed into a format to train the model, what exactly the model is predicting, what the metrics are, and how the metrics are justified, etc. The text should be significantly improved to aid the user in understanding their contribution.\n- The paper mentions the adjustment of parameters based on COVID-19 epidemiological studies, it does not specify whether the parameters used were local to the Recife population or if they were generalized from broader studies. Furthermore, the paper estimates an underreporting rate of approximately 50% but does not delve into the methodology for reaching this estimate. Detailed information on the parameter selection process would strengthen the paper's methodological rigor."

Insufficient Literature Review: The paper lacks a broader overview of existing\nepidemiological models (see e.g. [2]) and optimization strategies (see e.g. [5-6]). Notably, there is no mention of comparable models like OpenABM [1] or gleam [3]. A section on similar works is essential to evaluate the relevance and novelty of your approach within the field.\n2. Lack of Comparative Analysis: Absence of comparison with other optimization algorithms or epidemiological models weakens the paper's impact. Inclusion of comparisons, especially with differential compartmental models and agent-based models, would significantly strengthen the study.\n3. Methodology and Reproducibility: The methodology is clear, but including open-source code would greatly enhance reproducibility and scientific verification.\n4. Incomplete Results Section: The data presented covers a very narrow time window, which is insufficient to assess the model's predictive accuracy and applicability to broader pandemic dynamics.\n\nSpecific Observations:\n\n\u2022 Protection Rate Definition: The term \"protection rate\" is not clearly defined.\n\n\u2022 Vague statement: The author writes: \"This approach, using the SEPAI3R3O model, allowed\nus to obtain a more accurate representation of the spread of the virus in vulnerable areas\nof Recife.\" More accurate with respect to?\n\n\u2022 Inconsistencies in Data Presentation: Table 2 shows significantly different values from\nother sections without adequate explanation.\n\n\u2022 Underreporting Rate. The author writes: \"When the pandemic began manifesting in mid-\nMarch, the underreporting rate was 0.50%. \" I think it is 50%, isnt'?\n\n\u2022 Unended sentence. The sentence: \"The average protection rate over the period under\nanalysis was 0.014 (95 \".\n      \n\u2022 Simulated Data on Death Rates: The paper should explain why the simulated data shows higher death rates than observed. Usually, the number of deaths is a good indicator of the outgoing epidemic status and usually is not underreported. Do you have an explanation? In this case, the reduction is about 20/30%, from what I can guess from the plot fig.1 plot c.\n\n[1] Hinch, Robert, et al. \"OpenABM-Covid19\u2014An agent-based model for non-pharmaceutical interventions against COVID-19 including contact tracing.\" PLoS computational biology 17.7 (2021): e1009146.\n\n[2] Iranzo, Valeriano, and Sa\u00fal P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez. \"Epidemiological models and COVID-19: a comparative view.\" History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences 43.3 (2021): 104.\n\n[3] Gleam Epidemiological Model\n\n[4] Lau, Hien, et al. \"Evaluating the massive underreporting and undertesting of COVID-19 cases in multiple global epicenters.\" Pulmonology 27.2 (2021): 110-115.\n\n[5] Gopal, K., Lee, L.
