                        "value": "Thanks for the comments.\n\nQ1: Applying K-means to the learned embeddings often yields poor performance, primarily due to two reasons: a) imbalanced bin sizes (i.e., varying from a couple to hundreds), and b) inefficient incorporation of information from constraints derived from single-copy marker genes. To tackle these challenges, we designed a combined binning operation that integrates contig-level label propagation while maximizing constraint satisfaction (refer to equation 5).\nIt is a good question to ponder whether representation learning is beneficial for metagenomic contig binning. From my perspective, the primary strength of utilizing representation learning techniques, as opposed to traditional algorithms, lies in the efficient embedding of all relevant information together, bypassing the need for intricate algorithm design and moving towards large language models. Within our model, it is possible to concurrently represent the unitig-level assembly graph, nucleotide sequences, and supplementary information from single-copy marker genes. \nIn Figure 6, our ablation study on Sim100G reveals that UnitigBin-Learning (applying the K-Means algorithm to learning representations) yields unsatisfactory results. This is primarily attributed to the large number of bins and the challenge of imbalanced bin sizes, ranging from 3 to 652. We also assessed UnitigBin-Learning on Sim20G, a dataset with fewer bins and a less pronounced issue of imbalanced bin sizes. We achieved an F1 score of 0.93 (second only to the 0.97 obtained by RepBin) and an ARI of 0.87 (comparable to 0.96 for VAMB and 0.95 for RepBin). These results demonstrate competitiveness, significantly surpassing non-representation learning-based algorithms like MetaCoAG, which achieved F1 and ARI values of 0.54 and 0.79, respectively. Therefore, models capable of producing effective representations prove advantageous for metagenomic contig binning.\n\nQ2: We choose to learn the unitig-level assembly graph rather than the contig-level assembly graph to preserve the original data and avoid introducing errors in constructing the contig-level assembly graph from the unitig-level assembly graph.  The output from assemblers (such as metaSPAdes and metaFlye) is essentially a unitig-level assembly graph. Previous graph-based models devised strategies to construct a contig-level assembly graph from the unitig-level assembly graph to simplify it for the task of binning contigs. However, this construction process introduces errors, indicating that linked edges in the contig-level assembly graph may not necessarily belong to the same bin (e.g., the error rate for Sim50G is 7.3%). The motivation behind using the assembly graph is rooted in the homophily assumption, where linked unitigs/contigs are likely to belong to the same bin. The introduction of erroneous edges in the contig-level assembly graph adds complexity to embedding or learning. To circumvent these errors, we directly focus on the original unitig-level assembly graph."

These experiments are significant for demonstrating the transition from unitig-level assembly graphs to contig-level assembly graphs.\n\nThe experiments are insufficient. Most of the datasets are small-scale single-sample datasets. For a more robust comparison of binning performance, it is recommended to utilize the CAMI I and CAMI II benchmark datasets.

                        "value": "Thanks for the comments.\n\nQ1: UnitigBin cannot be viewed simply as an amalgamation of existing models. UnitigBin-Learning differs significantly from RepBin-Learning in that it not only provides them with different inputs. Furthermore, the initialization, propagation, and refinement processes within the Binning phase clearly differentiate UnitigBin from MetaCoAG and RepBin. We will highlight the contributions of our proposed UnitigBin model.\n\na) Modeling unitig-level assembly graph: We chose to learn unit-level assemblies rather than contig-level assemblies to preserve the original data and avoid introducing errors when constructing the contig-level assembly graph from the unitig-level assembly graph. The output of assemblers such as metaSPAdes and metaFlye is essentially a unitig-level assembly graph. Previous graph-based models devised strategies to construct contig-level assembly graphs from unit-level assembly graphs to simplify the contig binning task. However, this construction process introduces errors indicating that linked edges in the contig-level assembly graph may not necessarily belong to the same bin. The motivation behind using assembly diagrams is rooted in the assumption of homogeneity, where linked units/contigs may belong to the same bin. Introducing false edges into the contig-level assembly graph increases the complexity of embedding or learning. To avoid these errors, we focus directly on the original unitig-level assembly graph.\n\nb\uff09Learning: In the unitig-level assembly graph, nodes correspond to unitigs, and edges represent overlapping information between unitigs. Contigs are represented as paths in the unit-level assembly graph. In the assembly graph, nodes are contigs, and edges represent the overlapping information between contigs. 1) UnitigBin adopts a generative encoder-decoder framework as its main architecture, avoiding the need for negative graph sampling (time and memory consumption in large-scale assembly of graphs). RepBin, on the other hand, utilizes a contrastive graph learning framework. 2) UnitigBin incorporates heterophilious constraints by introducing a triplet Gaussian constraints optimization at the unitig level, while RepBin calculates the Euclidean distance between pairs of nodes in the contig level.\n\nc) Binning: a) UnitigBin employs a simple yet efficient matching algorithm to initialize constrained contigs by calculating the embedding and composition. In contrast, MetaCoAG initializes binnings by constructing a Weighted Bipartite Graph, finding a Minimum-Weight Full Matching, and dynamically adjusting bins based on three cases. b) UnitigBin performs label propagation at the unitig level, while taking into account heterogeneous constraints by designing a loss function that satisfies the constraints. RepBin, on the other hand, performs label propagation at the contig level and does not consider information from constraints. c) UnitigBin also uses a refinement algorithm to adjust the final binning results to minimize the number of constraint violations. In contrast, RepBin does not include any refining steps.\n\nQ2: Thank you for the recommendation. We will include Metadecoder as the baseline and apply SemiBin2 to long-read datasets. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we are unable to execute these two baselines. Due to Metadecoder's inferior performance compared to typical methods such as MetaBAT2 and SemiBin in several studies, and considering it is not a graph-based method, our paper primarily concentrates on graph-based methods and representative binning tools. \n\nQ3: Thanks for the suggestion. We'll incorporate CheckM2 as an additional evaluation tool for long-read datasets.\n\nQ4: Our proposed learning and clustering framework may also hold potential for exploration in various other microbiome-related domains, such as microbial sequences recovery. In mixed microbial communities, a diverse array of bacterial chromosomes and mobile genetic elements coexists, including microeukaryotes, plasmids, bacteriophages, and more. Accurately identifying these sequencing reads/contigs and reconstructing species is crucial not only for unraveling the functions of these microbiomes but also for monitoring microbial changes in oil and other contexts. It is feasible to integrate a graph representation learning framework into the encoding of the assembly graph, framing microbial sequence identification as a graph learning and identification problem.\n\nQ5: Thank you for the suggestion. We will incorporate more details about the dataset."

Our input data includes the assembly graph at the unitig level, nucleotide sequences, and additional constraints obtained from single-copy marker genes. \nWe simplify the clustering challenge of sequences and frame it as a task of graph learning and constraint satisfaction. In detail, we aim to incorporate two key pieces of information: a)homophily information within the assembly graph, indicating that unitigs/contigs linked together in the assembly graph are more likely to belong to the same bin, and b)heterophilious relations of constraints, stating that unitigs/contigs within the same constraint set must belong to distinct bins. The ideal situation for contig binning is that all contigs are grouped into distinct clusters corresponding to the constituent genomes and satisfy previous heterophilic constraints. \ni) In the learning phase, our primary focus is on acquiring the homophily structural information of the unitig-level assembly graph while simultaneously integrating heterophilious constraints in a soft manner, accomplished through the inclusion of a penalty function (refer to the equation 3). The objective function of the learning phase mainly consists of two components: the loss of the reconstructed graph that captures homogeneous information in the assembled graph and the loss of optimizing heterogeneous constraints to maximize constraint satisfaction. \nii) During the binning phase, our attention shifts to optimizing the heterophilous constraints and synergizing label propagation with maximizing constraint satisfaction (refer to equation 5). The primary components of the binning phase's objective function include labeling unannotated contigs using the homogeneous assembly graph and incorporating a loss term to maximize constraint satisfaction. The binning process, specifically the minimization of constraint violations, is illustrated in Figure A3(b). It can be observed that as the training/binning epochs increase, the number of violating heterophilious constraints decreases. \niii) Finally, as there are still some binning results violating the constraints, we introduce a refinement method to eliminate such violations. \n\nQ2:The binning of metagenomic contigs emphasize the extraction of features from the nucleotide sequences and assembly graph, possibly incorporating additional information from references or single-copy marker genes. And then organize these contigs into distinct clusters corresponding to the constituent genomes. Thus, contigs binning can be conceptualized as an unsupervised clustering problem. \nIn our paper, we utilize 12 datasets\u2014six assembled by metaSPAdes and six assembled by metaFlye. We execute our proposed UnitigBin along with selected baselines on these datasets to generate the final binning results. In the experiment, we primarily employ CheckM v1.1.3 and AMBER v2.0.2 to assess the performance of UnitigBin and the baseline methods. In Table 2, all runs of UnitigBin and the baseline methods are performed five times on Sim20G, and the best binning assignment (evaluated using the AMBER tool) is reported. Additionally, we also present the average values along with the corresponding standard deviation values. Significance tests are also conducted, and the results are presented below.\n| Methods   | F1(bp)         | F1(seq)        | ARI(bp)        | ARI(seq)       | C<5;P>90  |\n| --------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------- |\n| Maxbin2   | 0.985(0.005)   | 0.634(0.010)   | 0.987(0.003)   | 0.784(0.008)   | 19.3(0.6) |\n| SemiBin   | 0.982(0.007)   | 0.541(0.004)   | 0.954(0.024)   | 0.410(0.008)   | 19.0(0.0) |\n| VAMB      | 0.983(0.007)   | 0.604(0.012)   | 0.985(0.009)   | 0.969(0.007)   | 18.3(0.6) |\n| MetaBAT2  | 0.629(0.025)   | 0.313(0.011)   | 0.400(0.009)   | 0.224(0.008)   | 4.0(0.0)  |\n| GraphMB   | 0.950(0.031)   | 0.603(0.022)   | 0.552(0.012)   | 0.364(0.017)   | 9.3(0.6)  |\n| CCVAE     | 0.981(0.004)   | 0.617(0.004)   | 0.790(0.004)   | 0.431(0.034)   | 13.3(0.6) |\n| RepBin    | 0.955(0.012)   | 0.447(0.011)   | 0.959(0.004)   | 0.148(0.009)   | 15.7(0.6) |\n| MetaCOAG  | 0.955(0.006)   | 0.591(0.002)   | 0.988(0.003)   | 0.783(0.004)   | 14.7(0.6) |\n| UnitigBin | 0.995(0.005)\\* | 0.953(0.003)\\* | 0.992(0.003)\\* | 0.780(0.006)\\* | 19.7(0.6) |"

Homophily suggests that sequences connected in the assembly graph are more likely to belong to the same species. Typically, statistics-based approaches tend to exclude short sequences, often shorter than 1,000 bp, due to the instability of features extracted from nucleotide sequences. GNNs can leverage the homophily present in the assembly graph to assign labels to these short sequences."
