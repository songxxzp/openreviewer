Methodologically, the contribution of the paper are three-fold: (1) the development of a universal transformer tailored for molecule and protein data; (2) the introduction of a code-switch protein sequence approach to unpack residues; (3) the presentation of a multi-scale position encoding designed specifically for code-switch sequences. The authors claim that they effectively demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through enzyme-substrate and drug-target affinity tasks. Additionally, their method achieves comparable results in areas such as contact prediction, secondary structure prediction, and molecular property prediction tasks."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. The concept of unzipping residues into atom sequences and predicting the masked atom type appears flawed. Given the residue type or the types of adjacent atoms, deducing the type of the masked atom becomes straightforward, since the atom set is predetermined for each residue type. This indicates that unzipping residues does not introduce any unique or non-trivial information. Additionally, there is a lack of experiments to demonstrate that the masked atom type prediction loss contributes any meaningful insight.\n2. As shown in the Tables 2 and 3, ProSmith's results with ms-ESM offer only a slight enhancement over baselines, such as He et al. (2023) in Table 2 and Kroll et al. (2023b) in Table 3.\n3. Are the pre-trained language models fine-tuned for specific tasks? If not, the tables should encompass results with fine-tuning.\n4. The protein-only tasks seem trivial when protein structures are used as inputs. With knowledge of protein tertiary structures, it becomes easy to determine if two residues are in contact and to identify the secondary structure. Moreover, since the pre-training task includes pairwise distance prediction, there's potential for data leakage. The test data might overlap with the pre-training dataset.\n5. Despite the possible data and information leakage in the experimental framework, the proposed method fails to outperform standard protein language models like ESM-2 in tasks such as contact and secondary structure prediction. Given that the model incorporates a broader range of pre-training loss than ESM-2, these results suggest that universal pre-training across both proteins and molecules may not offer advantages in protein-only or molecule-only tasks. This significantly weakens the paper's primary claim: the benefit of combining protein and molecule data for pre-training.\n6. The ablation study only consider ablations on position encoding, neglecting the paper's other two significant contributions. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore comparisons with protein- or molecule-only pre-training, consider pre-training without unzipped sequences, and evaluate the impact of removing each pre-training loss.\n\nOverall, I recognize the significance of developing universal models for molecule and protein pre-training. However, the paper exhibits considerable flaws in its methodologies and experimental sections, making it below the standard expected for publication."

                        "value": "We express our gratitude to Reviewer 54HD for the valuable suggestions. In the following parts, we will thoroughly address your concerns regarding the design of code-switch sequences, technical novelty, model performance, ablation study, and other crucial aspects. Additionally, we will provide a detailed explanation to clarify any misunderstanding about the input of ms-ESM in downstream tasks. These updates have been incorporated into the revised manuscript, aiming to enhance the clarity of our paper. We welcome any further comments or feedback you may have.\n\n**Q1**: Given the residue type or the types of adjacent atoms, deducing the type of the masked atom becomes straightforward. There are significant flaws in the design of code-switch protein sequences, which can(not) potentially make the model learn meaningful insights from the unzipped sequences. \n\n**A1**:  Thanks for your comments. However, it seems that **the concluded significant flaws of code-switch protein sequence design could be caused by some misunderstandings.** The code-switch design and the unzip operation play crucial roles in multi-scale molecular modeling. Sorry for the confusion and we clarify it as follows: \n- **Unzipping residues also introduces non-trivial structural information for the model, aiding ms-ESM in learning diverse structural knowledge of residues.** Despite the limited types of amino acids and the fixed types of atoms within a given residue, structure-based training (pair-wise distance recovery) is conducted within an unzipped residue at the atomic scale. The structure of a single residue is thus highly diverse. Therefore, unzipping residues enables the model to acquire diverse structural information at the residue level.\n- **The unzip operation allows protein language models to learn associations between proteins and molecules and reuse the knowledge acquired by the model at the residue scale.**\n  - Similar to existing work [24] in cross-lingual pre-training, MLM training on code-switch sequences enables the model to capture correlations between information from the atom and residue scales.\n  - By retaining information at the original residue scale, the model can fully leverage the knowledge embedded in protein language models.\n  - The number of residue types does not impact the establishment of this association, because atom-scale information contains diverse structural details.\n- **Evidence from experimental results and related works**:\n  - Ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the unzip operation.\n    - Supporting the effectiveness of this approach, ablation experiments (as shown in Table D) reveal a significant performance decrease in protein-molecule tasks when the unzip operation is omitted. This underscores the crucial significance of this approach in constructing the semantic association between the two types of information.\n  - Related work also mentions the effectiveness of this approach.\n    - Concurrent work titled \"Generalized Biomolecular Modeling and Design with RoseTTAFold All-Atom\" [25] (published on bioRxiv after our submission to ICLR) introduces a similar concept called \"atomization\" and notes that this approach can assist the network in learning about general atomic interactions.\nIn summary, both experimental results and related work affirm the effectiveness of this approach, forming the foundational basis for constructing a unified semantic representation across multiple scales.\n\n**Q2**: The concept of multi-scale position encoding essentially merges residue- and atom-level embeddings. This has been previously proposed in other papers and, thus, lacks novelty.\n\n**A2**: Please check Q2 in the general response for a more in-depth discussion. In essence, our work stands out for three key reasons: i) Our core contribution lies in developing a model (not exisiting techniques) capable of uniformly processing proteins and molecules. ii) Unified molecular modeling represents a cutting-edge frontier in recent AI biological applications. iii) Integrating existing techniques into our multi-scale unified molecular modeling is a non-trivial task.\n\n**Q3**: The results present in the experimental section only show marginal improvements over the established baselines. The unified pre-training appears to diminish performance on tasks focused solely on proteins or molecules. \n\n**A3**: Please refer to the Q1 in the general response for more discussion. Briefly, i) as already mentioned in the answer to Q1 in the general response, this paper focuses on unified multi-scale modeling, aiming to obtain better results on protein-molecule tasks  instead of improving molecule/protein tasks universally. ii) We report molecule-only and protein-only results to verify that ms-ESM does not suffer from significant performance drops on separated molecular and protein modeling tasks."

                        "value": "**Q4**: As shown in the Paper Tables 2 and 3, ProSmith's results with ms-ESM offer only a slight enhancement over baselines.\n\n**A4**: Thanks for your comments. ms-ESM outperforms ESM-2+Uni-Mol in all protein-molecule tasks, and also surpasses a single strong protein model (such as ESM-1b, ProtBert) in most tasks. We will provide an analysis of the reasons from two different perspectives.\n- **Comparisons with separated protein and molecule models (ESM2 + Uni-Mol)**: ms-ESM outperforms ESM-2+Uni-Mol in all protein-molecule tasks.\n  - Our protein representation learning ability is similar to ESM-2, and our molecular representation learning ability is similar to Uni-Mol, but our performance on protrein-molecule joint modeling tasks is stronger than ESM-2 + Uni-Mol.\n    - During pre-training, we don't utilize any protein-molecule pair data just like all baselines and adopt the same fine-tuning setting. So we believe that the comparison is very fair. \n  - It is worth noting that our model maintains an advantage over ESM-2+Uni-Mol in all Protein-Molecule task metrics, which illustrates the rationale behind our unified modeling approach.\n- **Comparisons with a single strong protein model (such as ESM-1b, ProtBert)**:  Small ms-ESM can even outperform large models.\n  - Under unified modeling, ms-ESM's performance can match or surpass some single representation learning models with significantly larger parameter scales (such as ESM-1b 650M) even at a much smaller scale (35M) . \n  - This illustrates that, to enhance a model's performance in protein-molecule tasks, the most crucial strategy is to construct a unified model to obtain a consistent semantic representation. This proves the significance of the unified model.\n\n**Q5**: The related work section seems to overlook several pivotal studies pertinent to molecular modeling. \n\n**A5**: \nThank you for your information. Previously, as we focused more on protein and unified modeling, we did not include discussions of molecular modeling in our manuscript. Subsequently, we've included relevant discussions in the Appendix. We are open to further discussing any papers that reviewers consider pertinent to our work.\n- *Molecular Modeling.* Regarding the modality of molecules, studies on molecular modeling can be categorized into three groups:\n  - 1D-based methods: These represent molecules with SMILES strings and employ language modeling techniques, such as masking and contrastive self-supervision, to enhance molecular representation [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\n  - 2D-based methods: These represent molecules with molecular graphs, sharing common ideas with general graph modeling. Some methods [7, 8, 9, 10] mask key substructures of molecular graphs, like motifs and functional groups, and task models with reconstructing the masked parts. Others [11, 12, 13] align views from positive pairs (corrupt versions of the same graph) and simultaneously contrast views from negative pairs (different graphs). \n  - 3D-based methods: These directly utilize the 3D structure of molecules, aligning closely with our work. Earlier studies incorporated 3D information as an auxiliary input for 2D-based methods [14, 15, 16, 17]. More recent methods focus on molecular modeling with pure 3D inputs [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. Three self-supervised techniques have been designed: geometry masking, geometry predicting, and denoising. For masking, [18] masks bond information, while [19] masks atom types, requiring models to predict masked information based on remaining context. For predicting, [18] proposes an atomic prediction task with bond information to capture global structure from local information. For denoising, models reconstruct 3D structures by adjusting corrupted structures. When corrupting structures, [19, 20, 21] add Gaussian noise to each atom of the input molecule. Several methods further introduce E(3)- and SE(3)-invariance inductive bias to the denoising technique [19, 22, 23].\n\n**Q6**: The protein-only tasks seem trivial when protein structures are used as inputs.\n\n**A6**: We do not consider protein-only tasks as trivial because, in these tasks, ms-ESM only processes protein sequences at the residue level, as explained in Section 3.2: \"As ms-ESM supports protein residue sequences, we strictly adhere to TAPE\u2019s protocol.\" In both protein-only and protein-molecule tasks, we do not supply any protein structural information to ms-ESM, which is exactly the same situation as ESM-2. Therefore, we believe the comparison is fair.\n\n**Q7**: Are the pre-trained language models fine-tuned for specific tasks? If not,the tables should encompass results with fine-tuning. \n\n**A7**: Both ms-ESM and baseline methods are fine-tuned for specific tasks. We take the pre-train and fine-tune style to evaluate ms-ESM in protein-molecule, protein-only, and molecule-only tasks. We provide the fine-tuning protocol for each of tasks in section 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Sorry for the confusion. We have made it more clear in our revision."

We have counted the overlapping data in the test data and pre-training data and re-evaluated our model. After statistics, we find that the proportion of overlapped data is extremely low (less than 4\u2030). And **after removing all the overlap, we retest the model and the performance remains unchanged**. We have updated the above results in our revised manuscript.\n- Statistics and re-evaluation details: We count the number of samples contained in the pre-training dataset (AlphaFold DB) in the test sets for contact prediction and secondary structure prediction tasks. The results are as follows:\n  - It can be found in Table A that the proportion of data with leakage problems is extremely small.\n  - After removing leaked data, we reevaluate the model's performance on both tasks, and the results are shown in Table B and Table C.\n  - It can be seen that after removing leaked data, the performance of ms-ESM still reamins no change.\nIn summary, there is little issue of leakage during both the model training process and the downstream task testing process.\n\nTable A: The number of leaked data.

This significantly weakens the paper's primary claim: the benefit of combining protein and molecule data for pre-training.\n\n**A9**:\n- About the leakage problem:\n  - Information leakage:  The input of ms-ESM in protein-only tasks only contains protein sequences at the residue level, thus there is no information leakage in these tasks. For more details, please refer to Q6.\n  - Data leakage: There is almost no leakage of test data in protein-only tasks, and we also reevaluate the model's performance and find that the model performance remains almost unchanged. For more details, please refer to Q8.\n- The proposed method fails to outperform ESM-2: \n  - For more details, please refer to Q1 in the general response.\n    - ms-ESM retains comparable ability to ESM-2 in protein-only tasks.\n    - Even though ms-ESM can't beat ESM-2 in all protein-only tasks and ms-ESM can't beat Uni-Mol in all molecule-only tasks, ms-ESM still can beat  ESM-2+Uni-Mol in ALL protein-molecule tasks when using the same fine-tuning and evaluating protocol. This demonstrates the effectiveness of unified modeling."

                        "value": "**Q10**: The ablation study only considers ablations on position encoding, neglecting the paper's other two significant contributions. It would be beneficial for the authors to explore comparisons with protein- or molecule-only pre-training, consider pre-training without unzipped sequences, and evaluate the impact of removing each pre-training loss\n\n**A10**: Thank you very much for your helpful questions. We have added more ablation experiments (shown in Table D) and also added them to our revised manuscript. Here is the analysis of these results.\n- Ablation Study on Pre-training Objectives:\n  - Significantly decreased model performance is observed when either the masked atom type prediction loss or the pair-wise distance recovery loss is omitted.\n  - Notably, removing the pair-wise distance recovery loss results in a greater performance loss compared to omitting the masked atom type prediction loss.\n    - Explanation:\n      - Without using pair-wise distance recovery loss, the training loss of ms-ESM on the atomic scale is only masked atom type prediction loss. But more than half of the atoms in a molecule are carbon atoms, which makes the model learn very little information on the atomic scale using only masked atom type prediction.\n      - Without the pair-wise distance recovery loss, ms-ESM struggles to extract structural information from unzipped residues, making the training task too simplistic and hindering the acquisition of meaningful knowledge. \n  - Results indicate that, while both atom type and structural information are vital for atomic-scale details, structural information holds greater importance.\n- Ablation Study on Pre-training Data:\n  - A significant decrease in model performance is observed when either molecular data or protein data is excluded.\n  - Interestingly, the removal of protein data leads to a more substantial performance decline than omitting molecular data.\n    - Insights:\n      - When the model is not trained with protein data, it quickly forgets protein-related knowledge, resulting in a notable decline in overall performance.\n      - The model can still learn some atomic scale information through unzip operations without molecular data. This explains why the model performs better without molecular data compared to the scenario without protein data.\n      - This experiment effectively demonstrates the beneficial impact of the unzip operation in modeling atomic-scale information.\n- Ablation Study on Unzip Operation: As analyzed in Q1, the model performance drops significantly after removing the unzip operation, which illustrates its importance for modeling unified semantics.\n\nTable D.

                        "value": "I\u2019d like to thank the authors\u2019 efforts in addressing my questions during rebuttal. However, my questions about the soundness, novelty, experimental evaluation of the paper remain. Here is the detailed response:\u2028\n>**Q1: Design of the unzipped operation.**\n1. The authors claim that structural information can be learned through pairwise distance recovery on unzipped residues. However, the pairwise distances between atoms (with noise on coordinates) are provided in atom-scale position encoding. This means that the task is essentially learning to denoise the pairwise distance, which focuses on fine-grained features instead of global positional information about atoms. Also, the authors should provide more justification behind this design: Why corrupting coordinates instead of distances? Why denoising on distances instead of coordinates? Can we directly predict the coordinate for each atom or the side-chain angles for each residue?\n2. I don\u2019t think that the model can learn associations between proteins and molecules during pre-training, as it only mixes protein-only and molecule-only data during pre-training and does not include any protein-molecule interaction data.\n3. In my opinion, the ablation study shown in Table D is not convincing. In the table, the only operation with significant impact is \u201ctraining w/o protein data\u201d. \n4. I think it is not proper to use RosettaFoldAA as a reference to support the design of the unzipped operation. First, RFAA studied a very different problem and **they did use multiple kinds of protein-molecule data for pre-training, which was not done by this paper**. Second, even in their paper, they did not include an ablation study for the \u201catomization\u201d operation. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.\n\n>**Q2: Novelty of the multi-scale position encoding.**\n\nI still don\u2019t think the authors do a good job on designing multi-scale position encoding. The design is trivial in concept. Besides, as shown in Table 7, the \u201ccarefully designed\u201d residue-scale position encoding does not have large effects on the performance.\n\n>**Q3,4: Experimental results**\n\nAs the paper is titled \u201cfor universal molecular modeling\u201d, I expected that the model was able to achieve improvements on protein-only, molecule-only and protein-molecule tasks. That\u2019s also why I expected mixing protein-only and molecule-only data would be beneficial for each other.\n\nHowever, during rebuttal, the author claims their focus is just on protein-molecule tasks, which is contradictory to the presentation in the paper. I would suggest the authors to rethink about the contribution of the paper and put more stress on how the designed pre-training algorithm can help protein-molecule tasks. Also, if the focus is on protein-molecule tasks, more downstream tasks should be considered, e.g., protein-ligand binding in Atom3D.\n\n>**Q6: Structure input during fine-tuning**\n\nThe authors claim \u201cstructure information will not be used for protein-only tasks\u201c. This means that the model does not use atom-scale position encoding in downstream tasks. If so, please explicitly describe more details of these discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning in the main paper.\n\n>**Q8: Potential data leakage.**\n\nFirst, to remove the potential data leakage, you cannot only remove the overlap between pre-training and downstream datasets. Instead, the common practice should be remove all the sequences with high sequence similarity with the pre-training datasets.\nSecond, the real problem behind the data leakage is that the pre-training objective includes pairwise distance recovery. This means that the proposed methods use more data for training on the contact prediction than other baselines, which leads to unfair comparison."

                        "value": ">**General comments**\n\nI find it difficult to justify the experimental contribution of the paper (reasons in my reply to Q3,4). I think the paper shows convincing experimental results only if (1) the idea of universal pre-training can consistently improve any protein language models or (2) with the proposed pre-training methods, we can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the problems that the paper want to study.\n\nFor (1), I would expect more experiments on different language models to show the consistent improvement, and larger performance improve over the baselines.\nFor (2), I would expect more baselines included in the benchmark on the studied problems. In Tables 1&3, there are only 3-4 baselines considered. One possible reason is that the domain is still underexplored and some baselines are difficult to reproduce. In this case, I suggest the authors to implement some straightforward baselines, e.g., different protein language models, different molecule encoders and fusion mechanisms. \n\nMoreover, I suggest the authors to carefully use the word \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d. Clearly, ESM-2-35M is not a state-of-the-art method on contact prediction. But the authors claim \u201cms-ESM is on par with\nthe state-of-the-art in protein-only tasks\u201d in the protein-only tasks.\n\n\nOverall, I\u2019d like to express my gratitude again in the authors\u2019 long and detailed response. I believe there are still large space in the paper to improve. Therefore, I keep my score unchanged."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for the your patient response. I would also like to express my gratitude once again for the numerous valuable suggestions you provided for this work. Regarding your questions, our response is as follows:\n\n> **I don\u2019t think that the model can learn associations between proteins and molecules during pre-training, as it only mixes protein-only and molecule-only data during pre-training and does not include any protein-molecule interaction data.**\n\n* We do not consider it a drawback that we do not use protein-molecule interaction data. On the contrary, we believe that designing a mechanism for the model to learn the protein-molecule correlation on mixed protein-only and molecule-only data is a more meaningful approach. In many cases, collecting protein-molecule interaction data is challenging, and the data volume is significantly smaller than that of protein-only and molecule-only data. Therefore, exploring how to enhance the model's performance on protein-molecule tasks without using protein-molecule interaction data is a meaningful topic. \n* The unzip operation plays a crucial role in providing the model with atomic-scale information about proteins. Considering that most small molecule data is represented at the atomic scale, the unzip operation allows the model to uniformly represent both types of data at the atomic scale. This, in turn, assists the model in better capturing the correlation between the two. We have experimentally validated the significance of using the unzip operation to achieve this objective.\n* Our model is not in conflict with protein-molecule interaction data. In fact, to further enhance the model's performance in protein-molecule tasks, we can also fine-tune the model with protein-molecule interaction data to achieve additional performance improvements. However, this would create an unfair comparison between the model and the ESM-2+Uni-Mol combination. What we aim to reveal is the performance advantage of this unified modeling approach under similar training conditions (similar training data, similar training tasks) to ESM-2+Uni-Mol.\n\n> **Why corrupting coordinates instead of distances?**\n\nIn fact, you've raised a very good question. The reason we chose to add noise to coordinates rather than distances is primarily based on the following two considerations:\n* For structural information, adding noise to coordinates often has a similar effect as adding noise to distances. In both cases, the goal is to disrupt a structural information and require the model to reconstruct it. From this perspective, adding noise to coordinates can achieve this objective. Therefore, we opted for the approach of adding noise to coordinates.\n* In the classic molecular 3D structure representation learning work, Uni-Mol[19], the authors also employed the method of adding noise to coordinates and explored the optimal selection of noise parameters. Moreover, Uni-Mol has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. Considering that we are also engaged in pre-training for molecular structure representation learning, we referenced their approach. \n\n>**Can we directly predict the coordinate for each atom or the side-chain angles for each residue?**\n\nWe have also attempted to adopt the approach of coordinate prediction used in works like Uni-Mol. However, in practice, we encountered the following two issues:\n* Attempting to make the model predict coordinates necessitates dealing with SE(3) equivariance issues, requiring the introduction of a more complex equivariant head to predict atomic coordinates. This would make the model structure more intricate, and the added complexity did not significantly improve the model's performance. Consequently, we decided to remove this loss.\n* After adding this training objective, the training process became more unstable, making it more prone to issues such as gradient explosions. Therefore, to enhance training stability, we also chose not to retain this loss.\n\n>**The real problem behind the data leakage is that the pre-training objective includes pairwise distance recovery.**\n\nOne clarification that needs to be made is that our pairwise distance recovery is limited to atoms within the same residue. We do not provide the model with structural information for atoms across different residues, nor do we require the model to predict atomic distances across residues. Contact prediction, on the other hand, is more focused on distances between atoms in different residues. Therefore, training the model on the structural information within an individual residue will not lead to additional advantages for contact prediction tasks."

                        "value": ">**The \u201ccarefully designed\u201d residue-scale position encoding does not have large effects on the performance**\n\nIn Table 7, we specifically removed the residue-scale position encoding for the atoms while retaining the residue-scale position encoding for each residue. Therefore, the result under the \"w/o RSPE in atoms\" category does not imply that residue-scale position encoding is ineffective. In fact, residue-scale position encoding is crucial for the model to distinguish between different residues, even though we removed it from the individual atoms. The role of residue-scale position encoding is similar to sequence position embeddings in Transformer. Thus, without residue-scale position encoding, the model would be unable to discern the positions of different residues, significantly impacting its performance.\n\n>**This means that the model does not use atom-scale position encoding in downstream tasks.**\n\nFirstly, it's important to clarify a misunderstanding. Atom-scale position encoding is indeed utilized in downstream tasks. For molecular data, atom-scale position encoding is a crucial factor in distinguishing between different atomic positions. Therefore, we provide atom-scale position encoding of molecules for the model in all downstream tasks related to molecular data. The exception lies in our protein-only tasks, where we do not provide structural information for protein. The construction of atom-scale position encoding requires structural information, which is why we did not use atom-scale position encoding in all protein-only tasks. This is the specific reason for not using atom-scale position encoding only in protein-only tasks. Apologies for the misunderstanding. We will provide additional clarification in the paper to eliminate any misconceptions.\n\n\nThank you once again for the numerous valuable suggestions you provided, especially regarding the selection of experimental tasks. In the future, we will explore more protein-molecule tasks to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. Additionally, we apologize again for any misunderstandings caused. We will modify the relevant statements in the paper to be more accurate and reduce the potential for confusion."

To accomodate this change, the authors propose ad hoc position encodings depending on the scale (atom or residue).

In brief, our work is novel for three reasons: i) we take the construction of a model (not exisiting techniques) which can process proteins and molecules uniformly as the core contribution of our work. ii) Unified molecular modeling topic is the cutting edge of AI biological application emerging recently. iii) Adopting existing techniques to our multi-scale unified molecular modeling is non-trivial\n\n**Q2**: Lack of detail on certain topics, e.g., ORDER procedure and unintroduced symbols in Atom Scale Position Encoding.\n\n**A2**: Thank you for bringing this to our attention, which enhances the clarity of our paper. While we briefly touched upon these details in our manuscript (Appendix A and Sections 2.2, 2.3), we will now introduce them more comprehensively in the following paragraphs and **incorporate them into the revised paper.**\n- Regarding the ORDER procedure, as indicated in Appendix A (the final line of the Hyperparameters section), we adopt the default order from PDB (protein) and SDF (molecule) files for assigning order to the atom set.\n  - To elaborate, PDB and SDF serve as standard formats for describing atomic structures of proteins and small molecules, respectively. In both formats, atoms follow specific sorting principles. In our study, we directly utilize the sorted atoms for ease of implementation.\n  - It is important to note that, given our atom-scale position encoding employs Euclidean distance to describe positional relationships, the permutation of atom order does not impact our pre-training model.\n\n- For atom scale position encoding, following Uni-Mol [1], we use Euclidean distance and Gaussian kernel to encode the 3D position of atoms. For $h_i, h_j \\in \\bar{X}$ (both $h_i$ and $h_j$ can be a residue or atom in code-switch protein sequence $\\bar{X}$, Section 2.2), their atom scale position encoding $e_{ij}^{A}$ can be calculate as: \n$$\ne_{ij}^{A} = \\begin{cases}\n0 & h_i \\in \\bar{R} ~or ~h_j \\in \\bar{R} \\\\\\\\\nGaussian(Dis(c_i, c_j)) & otherwise, c_i = Coord(h_i),c_j = Coord(h_j) \\end{cases}\n$$\n  where $\\bar{R}$ is the set of all the residues in $\\bar{X}$ (Section 2.2), $Coord$ extracts coordinates from atoms (Section 2.2), $Dis$ calculates the Euclidean distance between two coordinates (Section 2.2), and $Gaussian$ is the Gaussian kernel (Section 2.3).\n\n**Q3**: Why is $E^A$ added to the standard attention? What happens if it's not added? \n\n**A3**:\n- To enhance the awareness of the 3D position relationship between atoms, we incorporate $E^A$ into the attention layer of the vanilla Transformer, inspired by the approach in Uni-Mol [1], a widely recognized technique in geometric molecular modeling [2, 3, 4] known for its efficacy in various downstream tasks. Specifically, when two atoms are in close proximity in 3D space, $E^A$ boosts the attention value between them, subsequently encoding this positional relationship into the Transformer.\n- Ablation studies detailed in our paper (Section 3.4) offer empirical evidence affirming the effectiveness of this 3D position encoding. In the absence of $E^A$, ms-ESM struggles to differentiate molecules with identical atoms but distinct structures, e.g., isomer [5], resulting in a performance drop from 0.546 to 0.537 (refer to Table 7 in our paper).\n\n**Q4**: Also in Section 2.4, my guess is that the scaling by $\\sqrt{d_k}$ gets disrupted by the $E^A$ term. Can you comment on this latter point?\n\n**A4**:\n- That's an excellent question! Currently, we haven't encountered any issues with disrupted scaling. However, we acknowledge the importance of this matter and plan to delve deeper into it in our future research.\n- It's worth noting that the inclusion of encoding (as represented by $E^A$ in our paper) into attention mechanisms is a widely adopted practice across various models in different domains. For instance, both T5 [9] and Swin Transformer [10] utilize this operation in language and vision modeling, respectively. Similarly, in the realm of molecule modeling, Transformer-M [2] and Uni-Mol [1] also incorporate this operation, demonstrating excellent performance in their respective domains."

                        "value": "**Q5**: Table 7 shows almost no improvement from vanilla ESM to the \"w/o RSPE in atoms\" variant.\n\n**A5**: Thank you for your insightful question. **The model's behavior in this ablation experiment aligns with our expectations, and residue-scale positional encoding in atoms aids the model in distinguishing atoms from different residues.** Here's an analysis of the phenomenon:\n- The model's behavior aligns with our expectations:\n  - In protein-molecule tasks, the model only requires protein sequences at the residue scale as input. Consequently, the addition of residue-scale positional encoding to atoms has no impact on the model's performance.\n- Despite the lack of performance improvement from adding residue-scale positional encoding to atoms, we choose to retain this feature in the model. This decision is driven by the understanding that residue-scale positional encoding aids the model in distinguishing atoms from different residues. In the future, we will also explore more diverse and effective approaches to integrate residue-scale information into atomic representations.\n\n**Q6**: Did you consider the idea of representing the structure of the residue with a graph neural network? What could be the up/downsides of this approach?\n\n**A6**: \n- Indeed, we did consider the idea of employing a graph neural network (GNN) for representing residue structures. However, in alignment with previous research, we opted for a Transformer-based architecture in this paper. While we acknowledge the promise of using GNN for residue representation, we chose the Transformer due to its established success in molecular modeling.\n- The Transformer-based architecture is a well-established and reliable choice in molecular modeling, serving as the foundation for many successful methods such as the ESM series and Uni-Mol. Utilizing this architecture, aligned with these well-established methods, offers a more direct and secure approach. It facilitates the incorporation of their experiences into our work, mitigating the risks associated with project development. Choosing a GNN as the backbone might introduce unnecessary complexities, such as the need to train the entire model from scratch.\n- We recognize the strengths of GNN in capturing detailed structural information. For instance, GNN allows us to define edge features to capture chemical bonds in residue structures. Furthermore, it enables us to specify aggregation strategies for modeling information related to functional groups and motifs. Despite not being the focus in this paper, we believe GNN holds promise for future exploration in representing residue structures.\n\n**Q7**: Can you detail how long the sequences you deal with, and how much their lengths increase by adding the atoms?\n\n**A7**: \n- As each residue in the AlphaFold dataset typically consists of 7.9 atoms, we choose a 6.5% unzip ratio (refer to Appendix A, Table 8). Consequently, the length of each protein sequence is expected to increase by an average of 7.9 * 6.5%, resulting in a 51.35% increase. This implies that the length of each protein sequence after unfolding will be approximately 1.51 times the original.\n- In light of this length increase, we make an adjustment to the maximum sequence length permissible for the model, transitioning from ESM-2's 1024 to 2048.\n  - In instances where the sequence length exceeds the model's updated maximum after unzipping, a restriction is enforced. One unzipped residue is randomly chosen and the unzipping process is halted until the length aligns with the model's predefined limit.\n\n[1] Zhou G, Gao Z, Ding Q, et al.

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your good suggestions. Following the comments, we clarify the details of our method and address these issues as follows. Further comments are welcome!\n\n**Q1**: The proposed method could not outperform baselines, as shown in Paper Table.5 and Paper Table.6. \n\n**A1**: Please refer to the Q1 of the general response for more discussion. Briefly, i) as already mentioned in the answer to Q1 in the general response, this paper focuses on unified multi-scale modeling, aiming to obtain better results on protein-molecule tasks  instead of improving molecule/protein tasks universally. ii) We report molecule-only and protein-only results to verify that ms-ESM does not suffer from significant performance drops on separated molecular and protein modeling tasks. \n\n**Q2**: Insufficient experiments regarding molecular representation learning affects the significance of the paper. Could you provide head-to-head comparisons against Unimol on molecular representation learning tasks, such as BBBP, BACE, Tox21?\n\n**A2**: Thank you very much for your suggestions. We did a quick run to fix your concern. We don't include the results you mentioned because this paper focuses on unified multi-scale modeling for obtaining better results on protein-molecule tasks, and we only report results on  several selected representative molecule-only tasks to verify that the proposed ms-ESM does not suffer from significant performance drops on separated molecular modeling tasks. However more experimental results on molecular representation will be definitely helpful for the analysis. The added results are shown in Table A and we will also add them to the manuscript. \n\nTable A: Molecule-only tasks\n|  | QM7 \u2193 | QM8 \u2193 | QM9 \u2193 | BACE\u2191 | BBBP\u2191 | TOX21\u2191 | PCBA\u2191 | SIDER\u2191 | HIV\u2191 | MUV \u2191 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Uni-Mol w/o H | 58.8678 | **0.0160** | **0.00540** | 83.20 | **71.52** | **78.92** | **88.12** | 57.71 | **78.3** | 72.0 |\n| ms-ESM | 60.8755 | 0.0166 | 0.00590 | **83.52** | 67.41 | 75.39 | 86.15 | **63.59** | 74.9 | **72.6** |\n| ms-ESM 8M | **52.8018** | 0.0173 | 0.00630 | 75.97 | 67.30 | 76.33 | 85.90 | 62.64 | 74.3 | 70.73 | \n\n**Q3**: How about scaling the 35 million model to 650 million? Could you provide the corresponding results? \n\n**A3**: We recognize the importance of understanding how changes in model size affect its performance. However, due to the substantial computational resources required to train the 650M model\u2014an estimated 16 A100 GPUs over two weeks\u2014we opted to train a smaller, 8M model to swiftly gather results and examine the impact of model scaling. Our intention is to extend this initial research by training larger models and including those findings in the final version of the paper.\n\nOur observations are as follows:\n- For tasks involving both proteins and molecules (as shown in Table B) and for tasks involving only proteins (as shown in Tables C and D), we found a clear trend: as the model size grows, there is a noticeable enhancement in performance.\n- For tasks involving only molecules (as presented in Table A): 1) The larger model tends to perform better on the majority of these tasks, correlating increased model size with improved outcomes. 2) However, a few tasks saw superior performance from the smaller model, notably QM7 and TOX21, suggesting that the larger model may be susceptible to overfitting in some cases.\n\nIn conclusion, **we generally observed that model performance tends to improve with an increase in the number of parameters**, with a few exceptions. We plan to validate these findings by evaluating the 650M parameter model upon its completion to further test the performance of a larger-scale model.\n\nTable B: The new results on enzyme-substrate affinity regression task\n| Method | Protein Pre-training | Molecule Pre-training | MSE\u2193 | R^2\u2191 | Pearson\u2191 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XGBoost | ESM-2 35M | Uni-Mol 48M | 0.652 | 0.528 | 0.727 |\n| ProSmith | ESM-2 35M | Uni-Mol 48M | 0.642 | 0.536 | 0.733 |\n| XGBoost | ms-ESM 35M | ms-ESM 35M | 0.623 | 0.548 | 0.742 |\n| ProSmith | ms-ESM 35M | ms-ESM 35M | **0.599** | **0.566** | **0.753** |\n| XGBoost | ms-ESM 8M | ms-ESM 8M | 0.63188 | 0.54213 | 0.7269 |\n| ProSmith | ms-ESM 8M | ms-ESM 8M | 0.61761  | 0.55247  | 0.7344 |\n\nTable C: New experimental results on contact map prediction.

After reading it carefully, I found there is still large room for improvement, although the authors have made great efforts to address the issues.\n\n- The scaling up of the model has not been addressed, and it is currently unclear how the proposed method performs at different model scales.\n\n- The performance on protein-only and molecule-only tasks is currently poor. Fourtunately, the authors have found excellent performance on protein-molecule complex tasks. However, there is a lack of crucial ablation experiments on protein-molecule complex tasks: ESM2 (protein) + msESM (molecule) and msESM (protein) + UniMol (molecule).\n\n- Have you attempted to randomly modify the order of atoms during the training/testing phase? Does it have any impact on the experimental results?\n\n- There are also many other questions raised by the other reviewers.\n\nI will raise the score to 6 to encourage authors' efforts, but it does not mean that I am satisfied with this work at this stage. If the authors intend to publish a paper, modifications to the experiments are needed to highlight the strengths and provide further analysis for the protein-molecule complex task. If the authors aim to satisfy my expectations, more exploration is required. Nonetheless, I appreciate your innovative ideas and efforts. If the authors truly believe that the proposed method has potential, it may require more time to fully immerse themselves in its development until it gains widespread recognition. After all, this is a pre-training work, and the workload involved is undoubtedly massive."

The ms-ESM model can take both protein sequences and molecules with 3D coordinates as input. \n\n\nThe model is pretrained using both protein dataset (AlphaFoldDB) and molecule dataset (from uni-mol). Each residue in a protein can also be unzipped to several atoms. The pre-training tasks are masked language modeling (MLM) and pair-wise distance recovery. \n\n\nThe architecture of ms-ESM is very similar to ESM, and one main difference is that the atom scale position encoding (Euclidean distance + Gaussian kernel) is used as a bias term in the attention layers.\n\n\nThe proposed ms-ESM is evaluated on protein-molecule tasks, protein-only tasks, and molecule-only tasks."

                        "value": "We thank reviewer ZacV for the helpful suggestions. In the following, we will address all your concerns regarding the paper presentation, implementation details, ablations, and intuitions. We have updated them in the revised manuscript and hope the replies can make our paper more clear. Any further comments are welcome!\n\n**Q1**: As many implementation details are omitted, the presentation in the experiments section is not clear enough.\n\n**A1**: Thanks for your kind notes. Previously, we cited corresponding papers for aligned details but did not include these details in our paper. **We have added these details in the revised manuscript to make it self-contained** and list them as follows:\n- Extra implementation details of protein-molecule tasks\n  - *Fine-tuning dataset.* Following ProSmith [1] (section 3.1), we finetune ms-ESM and all baseline models on dataset KM [2], Davis [3], and ESP [4] for enzyme-substrate affinity regression, drug-target affinity regression, and enzyme-substrate pair classification respectively. The KM dataset contains experimental affinity constants of 11,676 enzyme-substrate pairs. The Davis dataset provides 30,056 binding affinities for pairs of 72 drugs and 442 proteins. The ESP dataset consists of 68,754 positive/negative enzyme-substrate pairs with experimental evidence. We use the standard data split provided by ProSmith in fine-tuning.\n  - *Fine-tuning framework.* As mentioned in section 3.1, we use ProSmith's framework for a fair comparison. Specifically, the framework contains three main modules, i.e., molecule encoder, protein encoder, and fusion block. Two encoders extract features from proteins and molecules severally. The fusion block is a Transformer model, which is responsible for fusing protein and molecule features. The fused features are further used to regress the affinity values or predict binary affinity. We apply our model to ProSmith's framework by replacing both protein and molecule encoder with ms-ESM. We also provide the results of an XGBoost [12] variant of ProSmith, which removes the fusion block and uses simple concatenation for feature fusing. Note that we freeze both encoders in the experiments as suggested by ProSmith.\n  - *Fine-tuning hyperparameters.* We directly use the hyperparameters provided by ProSmith. Specifically, the fusion block for three tasks has 6 layers of Transformer whose hidden size is 768. The epoch number is 100 and the learning rate is 1e-5. The batch sizes of the three tasks are 12, 12, and 24. We use Adam [14] as the optimizer for ProSmith and GBDT [13] with 500 iterations as the predictors for XGBoost.\n- Extra implementation details for protein-only tasks\n  - *Fine-tuning dataset.* Following TAPE's protocol [5], we evaluate ms-ESM on secondary structure prediction and contact prediction tasks (section 3.2). Specifically, for secondary structure prediction, we use data from [6] as training and validation sets and use CB513 [7], CASP12 [8], and TS115 [9] as test sets. The training and validation sets are filtered at the 25% sequence identity threshold with these test tests. The final training, validation and three test sets have 8678, 2170, 513, 21, 115 protein sequences, respectively. For contact prediction tasks, we use training, validation, and test sets from ProteinNet [10] with training and validation sets filtered at the 30% sequence identity threshold. The final training, validation, and test sets have 20, 24, 13945 protein sequences.\n  - *Fine-tuning framework.* As suggested by TAPE, for both protein-only tasks, we use ms-ESM as the protein encoder. When doing secondary structure prediction, we use a linear output layer to predict the secondary structure each residue belongs to. When handling the contact prediction task, we use the attention from the last layer as features and then use a linear layer to predict whether these two residues have contact or not. Notably, both input of these two tasks is only protein sequences without structural information. Therefore, when using ms-ESM to handle these two tasks, we turn off the unzip.\n  - *Fine-tuning hyperparameters.* We set up all the hyperparameters aligned to TAPE. For secondary structure prediction, the epoch is 5,000, batch size is 10, and learning rate is 0.001. For contact prediction, the epoch is 5, batch size 64, and learning rate is 3e-5. We use AdamW [15] as the optimizer in secondary structure prediction and Adam in contact prediction.\n\n(To be continued.)"

                        "value": "(To continue)\n\n- Extra implementation details for molecule-only tasks\n  - *Fine-tuning dataset.* We use the fine-tuning data of Uni-Mol [11] to evaluate the molecule understanding ability of ms-ESM (section 3.3). Specifically, we use QM8, QM9 datasets for molecular property regression and HIV, MUV datasets for molecular property classification, which have 21786, 133885, 41127, 93087 molecules, respectively. The data split is also provided by Uni-Mol.\n  - *Fine-tuning framework.* Following Uni-Mol, a special token, i.e., [CLS], also exists in ms-ESM. Similar to NLP/CV, we simply use the representation of [CLS] to represent the whole molecule, and then use a linear head for fine-tuning on downstream tasks. For each molecule, we use the 3D conformation provided by [11] as the input of ms-ESM. In the fine-tuning stage, we do not add noises to atom coordinates.\n  - *Fine-tuning hyperparameters.* For a fair comparison, we did not search the best hyperparameters. Instead, we set up all the hyperparameters aligned to Uni-Mol. Specifically, the batch sizes for these four tasks are 32, 128, 256, and 128. The learning rates are 1e-4, 1e-4, 5e-5, and 2e-5. The training epochs are 40, 40, 5, and 40. We use Adam optimizer for all the tasks.\n\n**Q2**: The data size of downstream tasks.\n\n**A2**: Thanks for pointing it out.

Due to the page limitation, we report it in Table 8 of Appendix A: 6.5% of residues are unzipped as the main experimental setting. We have added it with other details in the main text.\n\n**Q4**: The pair-wise distance recovery is only used at atom scale and requires atom coordinates as inputs. How about removing this loss? What is the performance? Is this term necessary?\n\n**A4**: Thank you very much for your good questions. Actually, the pair-wise distance recovery loss is the most widely used pretraining objective for captureing geometric molecular information[11][19]. As you suggested, we did a quick run by removing it for ablation and the results are shown in Table A and we also have added them to our revised manuscript.\n\n- Results: As shown in Table A, when we do not apply pair-wise distance recovery loss, the performance of ms-ESM shows a significant decrease in the protein-molecule task.\n- Analysis:\n  - For molecular representation learning\n    - Without using pair-wise distance recovery loss, the training loss of ms-ESM on the atomic scale is only masked atom type prediction loss. But more than half of the atoms in a molecule are carbon atoms, which makes the model learn very little information on the atomic scale using only masked atom type prediction.\n  - For modeling unzipped residues\n    - Without using pair-wise distance recovery loss, ms-ESM will not be able to learn structural information from the unzipped residues. ms-ESM can only learn the mapping from residues to atoms' types. Since there are only a few types of residues, and the mapping is also fixed for a given residue, this training task is too easy to make the model learn meaningful information.\n\nTable A: Ablation study on pair-wise distance recovery loss\n|  | MSE \u2193 | R^2 \u2191 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Vanilla ms-ESM | 0.627 | 0.546 |\n| w/o pair-wise distance recovery loss | 0.645 (+0.018) | 0.533(-0.013) |"

                        "value": "**Q5**: Can\u2019t intuitively understand why ms-ESM can outperform two separate pre-trained models (one for protein, and one for molecule)? Basically, I think the capacity of two models should be greater than a single model.\n\n**A5**:\n- Yes, the capacity of two separate models is larger than one unified model. ms-ESM performs better because **the benefits of unified modeling inside one model (with specific designs) make it learn the unified context jointly and implicitly, which outweighs its shortcomings in capacity.**\n- The above observation has also been found in multi-lingual learning and multi-modal learning areas. Specifically, [18] shows that a unified multi-lingual machine translation model (one model for all language pairs) can outperform translation models trained separately. [17] demonstrates that modeling vision and language directly inside one model can beat methods that fuse the two modalities later.\n- Moreover, visualization in our paper (Figure 4) also indicates that our unified ms-ESM can provide more harmonious protein/molecule features than two separate models, i.e., EMS-2 and Uni-Mol.\n\n**Q6**: Is the comparison in protein-molecule tasks fair?\n\n**A6**: \n- Yes, the comparison is fair. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we follow the benchmark protocol from ProSmith [1] to evaluate ms-ESM and all the baseline methods. In other words, the settings of all the models being compared are well-aligned.\n- Smaller ms-ESM outperforms two larger models, which proves the benefit of unified modeling even more significantly. Specifically, ms-ESM is at a disadvantage of the model capacity compared to ESM-2 + Uni-Mol (35M < 35M + 48M). However, Table 1, 2, and 3 in our paper clearly show that ms-ESM beats ESM-2 + Uni-Mol.\n\n[1] Kroll A, Ranjan S, Lercher M J.
