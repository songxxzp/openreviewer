Incremental Document-up Setup \nThe novelty of this work can be enhanced if there's empirical study on how ACID perform on the incremental document update setup, where DSI and NCI are not capable of (require re-clustering, as noticed by the author in first paragraph on Page 2). How does ACID perform on new document IDs, without re-training the models?\n\n\n### 2. Lack of comparing baselines\n(1) Why not following the same train/test split as NCI, as the author of NCI released their dataset/code since Nov, 2022 [https://github.com/solidsea98/Neural-Corpus-Indexer-NCI]? For example, they have pre-processed datasets available at least for NQ and TriviaQA. \n\n(2) The author should compare ACID with other retrieval baselines, such as the embedding-based retrieval methods (e.g., DPR/ANCE) and sparse retrieval methods (e.g., BM25/BM25+DocT5Query), as reported in Table 1 and Table 2 of NCI paper [Wang et al, 2022)?\n\n### 3. Lack of ablation studies for the effect of data augmentation\nIt is not clear how much performance gain is from the generated keyphrases or the amount of data augmentations. Specifically,\n\n(1) The author should consider an ablation experiment to see how the model performs versus the amount of data augmentation used. The data augmentation refers to the amount of (synthetic query, document ID) pairs. \n\n(2) If the proposed method obtain performance gain from using data augmentations, then the comparing baselines should also use the same amount of data augmentation. Otherwise, the comparison is not very fair."

The key idea is to digress from traditional cosine-similarity-based computation where documents and information needs were separately encoded into a more homogeneous encoding. While there were issues in the initial models as reported by this paper, this paper further improves the state-of-the-art by automatically generating abstract keywords associated with a document using a language model.\n\nThe abstract keywords seem interesting and from the prompt, the authors tend to automatically extract \"topics\" for every document. Given that there have been works surrounding topics and transformers, the abstraction keywords could very well be latent topics, e.g., Thompson L, Mimno D. Topic modeling with contextualized word representation clusters. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.12626. 2020 Oct 23. and there are some follow-up published works by other authors.\n\nWhat happens in this work is that the authors gather a certain number of keywords using a language model. Then these keywords are used as IDs replacing the previous efforts."

It's not clear how the proposed method actually performs compared with other retrieval baselines.\n \n* **Regarding the method**.\n  * The cluster index based document ID would ensure there are no duplication in document IDs, as each document is an unique leaf in the hierarchical clustering tree. This is not the case for ACID. As the indexing space grows, there could be more and more chances that multiple similar documents getting the same document ID.\n  * In clustering based document ID setting, similar documents would share document id prefix since they are closer in the hierarchical clustering tree.
