                    "value": "> **TL;DR:** The paper provides a theoretical analysis on the IST algorithm. The analysis is more flexible than previous IST theoretical analysis works. However, I find the experimental work lacking. Addressing my concerns and questions can improve the score.\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Independent Subnetwork Training (IST) in the context of distributed machine learning with a focus on data and model parallelism. The study identifies the lack of a rigorous understanding of IST convergence as a motivation for the research. The main contributions of this work include a novel approach to analyzing distributed methods that combine data and model parallelism, an analysis of IST in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios without restrictive gradient estimator assumptions, and the identification of settings where IST can optimize efficiently or converge to a well-characterized irreducible neighborhood. The research is supported by carefully designed experiments and provides valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of IST in large-scale machine learning."

That is why, in the main part of the paper, we focus on contributions from theoretical analysis. Another reason is the limited space allowed by the conference submission format. If the reviewer believes that moving the experimental results to the main part will strengthen the points we are making, we can do this in the camera-ready version.\n\n> The work is mainly focused on the quadratic model. \n\nWe address this in our general response ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhVns87e74&noteId=fjCbL9Q2IZ)) to all reviewers regarding assumptions.\n\nThis model is chosen for its commonality in supervised machine learning, including its use in neural networks and its demonstrated efficacy in providing theoretical insights for complex optimization algorithms. In our paper, we emphasize that, despite its apparent simplicity, the quadratic model poses significant analytical challenges, particularly due to the biased gradient estimator used in IST. This makes it a compelling choice for analyzing complex phenomena within optimization algorithms. We further demonstrated that even in seemingly straightforward scenarios, such as the homogeneous interpolation case, the algorithm might not converge.\n\n## Responses to questions\n\n> Can this work be extended to neural networks such as [1]?\n\nAs far as we know, convergence of ResNets training is not adequately understood even for much simpler optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. This lack of understanding is compounded in the case of IST due to the biased nature of the gradient estimator and the complexities inherent in distributed training. Given these challenges, a  straightforward extension of our current work to ResNets or similar architectures is not feasible at this stage.\n\n\nBest regards, Authors"

We greatly value careful reading of the material and the positive evaluation of our work.\n\n## Comments on Weaknesses\n\n> Section 2.2 lists 3 assumptions for the theoretical analysis. The authors also discuss the necessity of each assumption. Could the authors try to remove one of them? Specifically, is it possible to discuss other problems other than the specific quadratic one?\n\nWe address this weakness in our general response ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhVns87e74&noteId=fjCbL9Q2IZ)) to all reviewers regarding assumptions.\n\nWe note that the assumption of exact submodel gradient computation can be easily generalized to stochastic estimators with bounded variance. Regarding the choice of a quadratic model. We chose this approach due to the clear theoretical insights it provides, as detailed in our study. Analyses of similar methods with non-quadratic loss functions have often led to restrictive and impractical assumptions, resulting in unsatisfactory convergence bounds, as discussed in Section 4.3 and Appendix C. The complexity and lack of a suitable theoretical framework for a general class of $L$-smooth functions, particularly with challenges like biased gradient estimators, further motivated our decision.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the value of extending our analysis to non-quadratic settings, the current theoretical landscape and the intricacies of such an extension necessitated our initial focus on the quadratic model. This foundational work sets the stage for future exploration in more complex loss functions as the field advances.\n\n\n> The paper focuses on the theoretical aspects of IST. It would be insightful to discuss the practical implications of the findings for real-world applications and provide guidance on effectively utilizing IST in various distributed training scenarios.\n\nThank you for your note on the practical implications of our findings. We discussed it in our general comment ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhVns87e74&noteId=Y3PkEuz0tL)) on experiments to all reviewers.\n\nBriefly, our study indicates that IST can be highly efficient in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, given interpolation conditions typical for large neural networks. However, in the more general case, we found that the convergence of na\u00efve IST is influenced by the level of heterogeneity among the distributed nodes. Specifically, decreasing the learning rate can be especially helpful in heterogeneous scenarios for reducing error.\n\n\n> Figures 1a and 1b have different vertical axis, relative error and absolute error. Could the authors provide both relative and absolute error for these two cases.\n\nWe would like to note that it was done on purpose. The first (1a) plot illustrates that the method (functional gap) converges to the neighborhood of the solution in the first case. While the second (1b) one shows that the method\u2019s iterates converge to a fixed point different from the optimum. We can provide additional results in the camera-ready version of the paper.\n\n> At the bottom of Page 2, $\\mathbf{R}^d \\to \\mathbf{R}$\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We already fixed it in our revision.\n\nBest regards, Authors"

Performing only one gradient computation at each node requires very frequent communication with the server, which will incur high communication costs. Hence, performing multiple gradient descent steps in the local mode is more desired as in the IST work [1] and [2]. I admit taking multiple steps may hurt the accuracy, while the main motivation of IST is saving communication costs under the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.\n*  **Why is the gradient sparsification introduced in Eq.6 for IST?** The original IST work formulated the IST training method as Eq(69)  without the gradient sparsification operator. The authors state that \u201cit can create a significant disparity between theory and practice\u201d in Appendix D. I didn\u2019t notice that IST uses any form of gradient sparsification, as IST is orthogonal to gradient sparsification techniques.  The motivation for introducing this operator in IST formulation is unclear. \n\n[1] Binhang Yuan, Cameron R Wolfe, Chen Dun, Yuxin Tang, Anastasios Kyrillidis, and Chris Jermaine.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer GaQK,\n\nThanks for the time and effort devoted to our paper. We greatly value careful reading of the material and Appendix.\n\n## Responses to questions\n\n> Can the author further discuss why the assumption that performing only one gradient computation is reasonable, as it is not a common choice for efficient IST? It would be better if the author could show the theoretic analysis still holds with a more relaxed assumption, like performing twice or more.\n\nWe address this comment in our general response ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhVns87e74&noteId=fjCbL9Q2IZ)) to all reviewers regarding assumptions.\n\nWe understand that this assumption might seem restrictive and potentially impractical due to the increased communication costs it could entail. However, it is required to isolate and analyze specific properties of IST more effectively. We would like to highlight that our theory could potentially be extended to scenarios involving multiple local steps, as suggested in the approach of Khaled et al. (2019). However, the current state of research indicates that no conclusive analysis demonstrates the advantages of multiple local steps in the worst-case scenarios. We believe that the insights gained from our approach are crucial for guiding future research that might explore more complex scenarios, including those involving multiple local steps.\n\n\n> Can the authors provide a clear discussion on the reason for introducing the gradient sparsification operator compared to the original formula? Why is this operator necessary when analyzing the convergence of IST if those two techniques are orthogonal?\n\nThank you for bringing this up! Let us clarify the point.\n\nGradient sketching is introduced to better represent submodel computations. Note that when the gradient is taken with respect to the submodel $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{C} x)$ it can result in a non-sparse update, which contradicts the idea of IST. To illustrate this, imagine a logistic regression problem, for which computing a gradient for compressed weights vector (even for zero) may result in a non-sparse gradient (potentially without any zeros at all). That is why we believe that sparsification of the gradient is an essential component of correclty representing IST. Thus, our work improves upon the analysis of the original paper.\n\n\nBest regards, Authors\n\n___\n\nKhaled, Ahmed, et al. \"First analysis of local GD on heterogeneous data.\" arXiv preprint:1909.04715 (2019)."

We are aware that assumptions we make may deviate from practical settings. However, our goal was not to replicate real-world scenarios closely but to develop a fundamental understanding of certain theoretical aspects of IST.\n\n> Although the suggested analysis of the convergence and bias sounds interesting and useful, the limited experimental validation would limit the application of the proposed observation in real distributed training scenarios.\n\nWe comment on this Weakness in our general comment ([link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HhVns87e74&noteId=Y3PkEuz0tL)) on experiments to all reviewers.\n\nIn addition, let us stress that the main contribution of our work is from the theory side, and that is why, in our experiments, we focus on well-controlled settings that satisfy the assumptions in our paper to provide evidence that our theory translates into observable predictions. These are well-designed experiments that do support our theory and core claims. Since our results guarantee that the methods work, we do not need to test them extensively on large or complicated datasets and models to show that they do (which is necessary for heuristics unsupported by any theory).\n\n## Responses to questions\n\n> Can we see a more realistic distributed training scenario (e.g., training ImageNet deep neural networks) to validate the key observations of this work?\n\nWe consider extending our experimental results with neural network training for the camera-ready version of the paper. Due to time constraints, it is not possible to provide them during the rebuttal period.\n\n\nBest regards, Authors"
