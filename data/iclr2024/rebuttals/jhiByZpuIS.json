                    "value": "- The paper focuses on the significant task of collaborative training, which plays a vital role in various scenarios, particularly in training large models. The authors provide a clear motivation for their work, emphasizing the challenges faced when training resource-intensive models on devices with limited resources, and the necessity of collaborative learning frameworks. The practical application of MSfusion is also discussed, highlighting real-world scenarios where multiple companies with resource-limited servers and private data can collaborate to train high-performance large models.\n- A highly effective collaborative training framework, MSfusion, is proposed in the paper, offering both computational efficiency and high performance. MSfusion leverages model splitting to enable effective and efficient training of large models across participants with resource constraints. The paper introduces the double shifting model splitting scheme, adaptive model overlapping, and contrastive loss functions to maintain training effectiveness while significantly reducing computation and communication costs. The authors provide a detailed description of the MSfusion framework, including the training process, communication protocol, and model aggregation method.\n- The proposed approach is validated through experiments on various tasks. The authors conduct experiments on several datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, to evaluate the performance and efficiency of MSfusion. The results demonstrate that MSfusion achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while substantially reducing computation and communication costs. The authors also perform ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each component of MSfusion to its overall performance.\n- The paper includes in-depth theoretical analysis to support the proposed framework. This analysis encompasses the mathematical reasoning for the double shifting model splitting scheme and the definition of an unbiased compressor. The authors provide mathematical reasoning for DSS, which serves as a crucial component of MSfusion. Additionally, they introduce the definition of an unbiased compressor, which is employed to compress the model updates before transmission, thereby reducing communication costs. Theoretical analysis is provided to support the effectiveness of these components and their contribution to the overall performance of MSfusion."

Here, we provide answers to your concerns point by point.\n\n**Weaknesses 1:** Concern about the importance of the proposed contrastive learning objective and the dynamic overlapping method.\n\n**Our response:** Thank you for your insightful assessment. The crux of our incorporation of the contrastive learning objective and dynamic overlapping method within MSfusion aimed to address the divergence between local participant models and the aggregated model, aiming for notable performance enhancements. To better substantiate the importance of these adaptations, we've extended our experiments to include the WikiText2 dataset, focusing on ablation studies.

This main attributed to the larger relative size of local model parameters within the transformer architecture, where the model drift problem is further amplified. \n\nThese additional experiments underscore the tangible benefits and substantial impact of integrating these components into MSfusion, further solidifying their role in enhancing overall performance. We believe these supplementary findings reinforce the significance of the contrastive learning objective and dynamic overlapping method within MSfusion, lending stronger support to their effectiveness in improving performance.\n\n**Weaknesses 2:** Need clarification for the association between the proposed collaborative training framework and the contrastive learning objective.\n\n**Our response:** In our proposed decentralized collaborative training algorithm, we've highlighted two pivotal components: model shifting on a single server and model aggregation across servers. These aspects inherently introduce divergence within the local split model across rounds, as well as divergence between the local split model and the global full model. To explicitly address these divergence issues, our design integrates a contrastive learning loss that leverages representations from the local training model, local aggregated model, and the local model from the preceding round. This strategic utilization of contrastive learning aims to mitigate the challenges associated with model shifting within our MSfusion method. It's important to note that this contrastive learning objective is specifically tailored for our sub-model shifting algorithm, uniquely crafted for decentralized sub-model learning. This customized approach is a distinct facet of our decentralized framework, providing a targeted solution to the challenges of divergence encountered in collaborative training scenarios.\n\nThis contrastive learning method, while intricately woven into our collaborative framework, also holds potential applicability beyond our specific framework. Its adaptability to other distributed learning frameworks or its potential benefits to the backbone model itself can indeed be an area of further exploration. However, the unique synergy between the contrastive learning objective and our decentralized sub-model shifting algorithm remains a central and distinctive aspect of our proposed MSfusion method."

To solve this problem, model splitting and contrastive loss functions are adopted. The research problem is interesting and important, and technical solution is reasonable and easy to follow. However, there is a gap between the research background and the experimental setup. The most serious issue is that the models used in the experiments of the paper cannot be called as large models. Besides, both of the two adopted techniques, i.e., model splitting and contrastive loss have been widely explored in many existing federated learning approaches, leading to novelty concerns."

These two proposed techniques, i.e., model splitting and contrastive loss have been investigated by many existing researches, while I do not find sufficient discussion on the related works. To have a clear view on the contribution, it is reasonable to have a comparison between the proposed approach and [1][2].\n2.\tThere is a gap between the experimental setup and the research background of the paper. From the title and abstract of the paper, I was looking forward to seeing collaborative training of large models, especially since the first sentence of the abstract mentioned models like GPT-3. However, I was surprised to find in the experimental setup that the visual tasks were performed using ResNet-18, and the model used for text-related tasks was not explicitly mentioned. But based on the calculated FLOPS in Table 1, I can infer that the parameter size of this model is far less than 1B. I am curious if a model with such parameter size can be considered a large model. If the authors decide to claim this framework is designed for Large Model, I highly recommend to conduct experiments on real large models such as models with at least billion-sized parameters.\n3.\tInsufficient baselines. The authors claim that the proposed framework is compared with partial training-based approaches, however, there are some well-recognized approaches missed, e.g., [1][3].\n4.\tLacks of theoretical analysis. Considering the there is a proposed loss function in the framework, it is better to have a theoretical convergence analysis on the framework.\n5.\tThere are some typos, e.g., \" for TinyImageNet experiments for WikiText2 experiments is 800\" in section A.2.2.\n\n\nMentioned Reference\n\n[1] Thapa, Chandra, et al. \"Splitfed: When federated learning meets split learning.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

                        "value": "Thank you for your review and thoughtful comments and suggestions. We have updated our paper based on your feedback and we will also address each point raised in the following separate comments.\n\n**Weaknesses 1:** Novelty concern toward the previous splitting learning and FL works.\n\n**Our response:** Please note while we use the word \"model splitting\" in our approach, there is fundamental difference between model splitting approach in this paper and the \"split learning\" in Splitfed framework [1]. In our decentralized collaborative learning setting, there is no centralized server, and the model are split across different participants. In Splitfed, or more generally split learning, the model is split across a central server and clients, who work together to train the entire model through communicating intermediate data embeddings and gradients. Due to splitting of the model, the clients can not train its own part independently due to missing computations of the submodel at the server side.  In sharp contrast, for the setting considered in this paper and the proposed MSfusion scheme, each participant is assigned a (dynamically changing) subset of model parameters, and **the training of these parameters are done independently at each participant**.  We believe that this difference can be well illustrated by Figure 1 and Figure 2 in our paper, and Figure 1 in Splitfed paper. \n\nWhile contrastive learning was utilized in Moon [2] to deal with data heterogeneity in federated learning, we use constrastive learning with a drastically distinct purpose of addressing the divergence within the local split model across rounds, as well as divergence between the local split model and the global full model, arising from the double shifting model splitting scheme introduced by MSfusion.  To explicitly address these divergence issues, we design a novel contrastive learning loss in (7) that incorporates representations from the local training model, local aggregated model, and the local model from the preceding round. It's important to note that this contrastive learning objective is specifically tailored for our sub-model shifting algorithm, uniquely crafted for decentralized sub-model learning. This customized approach is a distinct facet of our decentralized framework, providing a targeted solution to the challenges of divergence encountered in collaborative training scenarios. \n\nTo summarize, our designs of model splitting and contrastive loss have fundamental differences with Splitfed [1] and Moon [2] respectively, in terms of design goals and specific implementations.\n\n[1] Thapa, Chandra, et al. \"Splitfed: When federated learning meets split learning.\" Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence.

The authors propose a new model splitting strategy that assigns a submodel of the\nfull global model to each participant.

The evaluation is conducted\nover 3 image datasets (i.e., CIFAR10, CIFAR 100, and TinyImageNet) and 1 natural language\ndataset (i.e., WikiText2) using ResNet18 and Transformer-based network."

                        "value": "Thank you for your thorough feedback. We offer the following responses to address your concerns and questions:\n\n**Weaknesses 1:** Contribution concern over existing partial training work.\n\n**Our response:** We would like to emphasize that the introduced double shifting model splitting scheme (DSS) requires careful design of splitting scheme across participants and aggregation rounds (including initial placement of submodels, and the dynamic adjustment of model overlaps). Together with another important novel design of contrastive loss function, the proposed DSS enables each participant to operate with equally minimum computation and communication loads, achieving good performance on large models that cannot be trained in entirety on a single participant. \n\nNote that the related works in Section 2.3, while also utilizing partial training, exhibit quite distinct goals and designs. For instance in [1], the goal of model splitting is to accommodate client heterogeneity, and achieving good model performance relies on existence of powerful clients who train the entire model locally. Such clients do not exist in our considered setting (all participants are resource constraint who cannot train the entire model locally), and designing model splitting scheme poses major challenges that are addressed in this paper.\n\n[1] Samiul Alam, Luyang Liu, Ming Yan, and Mi Zhang. FedRolex: Model-heterogeneous federated learning with rolling sub-model extraction, NeurIPS 2022.\n\n**Weaknesses 2:** The convex assumption over the loss function (i.e., Assumption 1) for convergence analysis is quite strong.\n\n**Our response:** We agree that the smoothness and strong convexity assumptions over the loss function are strong, but it is worth noting they are also widely adopted in the literature of distributed learning frameworks, like [2][3][4]. In these works, smoothness and strong convexity assumptions are also made to facilitate the convergence proofs. Our convergence analysis can also be viewed as an improvement over existing partial training works since no convergence analysis is provided in previous works like HeteroFL and FedRolex. \n\n[2] Aleksandr Beznosikov, et al. \"On Biased Compression for Distributed Learning.\" arXiv:2002.12410, 2020.\n\n[3] Tian Li, et al. \"Ditto: Fair and Robust Federated Learning Through Personalization\" ICML 2021\n\n[4] Yifan Shi, et al. \"Improving the Model Consistency of Decentralized Federated Learning\" ICML 2023\n\n**Weaknesses 3:** Limited NLP evaluation.\n\n**Our response:** Thank you so much for pointing out this. In order to better evaluation our proposed MSfusion for LLMs, we have added two new wildly adapted NLP datasets PennTreebank and WikiText103. For PennTreebank, it contains about a million tokens with a vocab size of 10,000, and for WikiText103, it contains about 103 million tokens with a vocab size of 267,735. Together with WikiText2, our evaluation now covers 3 computer vision tasks and 3 NLP tasks, with different global full model parameter sizes, ranging from 7.32M for PennTreebank to 139.01M for WikiText103. The results are shown in the following table, which we have added to the Table 1 in the revised draft. The table demonstrates that our proposed MSfusion can successfully finish the collaborative training process with good performance, while greatly reducing the computation cost for each participant. We hope that this additional experiment can address the reviewer\u2019s concern and strengthen our contribution. \n\n|            | PennTreebank           |            |             | WikiText2              |             |             | WikiText103            |            |             |\n| :--------- | :--------------------: | :--------: | :---------: | :--------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :--------------------: | :--------: | :---------: |\n| Methods    | Perplexity             | FLOPs      | $ \\mu_n\\$ | Perplexity             | FLOPs       | $ \\mu_n\\$ | Perplexity             | FLOPs      | $ \\mu_n\\$  |\n| HeteroFL   | 55\\.97 $\\pm$  5.4    | 148\\.6M    | 75%         | 579\\.05 $\\pm$  8.4   | 1\\.08B      | 75%         | 784\\.21 $\\pm$  23    | 111\\.9B    | 75%         |\n| FedRolex   | 61\\.52 $\\pm$  6.8    | 148\\.6M    | 75%         | 547\\.32 $\\pm$  45    | 1\\.08B      | 75%         | 697\\.42 $\\pm$  33    | 111\\.9B    | 75%         |\n| Fed-ET     | N/A                    |            |             | N/A                    |             |             | N/A                    |            |             |\n| MSfusion S | 9\\.09 $\\pm$  0.7     | **36\\.2M** | 21\\.875%    | 44\\.33 $\\pm$  3.6    | **198\\.5M** | 18\\.75%     |  13\\.21 $\\pm$ 1.1   | **32\\.6B** | 21\\.875%    |\n| MSfusion M | 8\\.02 $\\pm$ 0.5     | 41\\.8M     | 25%         | 5\\.28 $\\pm$  0.4     | 290\\.1M     | 25%         | 8\\.92 $\\pm$  0.6     | 37\\.3B     | 25%         |\n| MSfusion L | **3\\.11 $\\pm$  0.2** | 91\\.4M     | 50%         | **3\\.59 $\\pm$  0.2** | 633\\.2M     | 50%         | **6\\.31 $\\pm$  0.4** | 74\\.4B     | 50%         |"

As clarified in our paper, our study focuses on collaborative training of large models, where participants possess comparable yet limited split model sizes. In the experiments outlined in Table 1, the split model sizes for all participants are fixed. Particularly concerning transformers, the local split model parameters are relatively larger compared to ResNet in computer vision tasks. This discrepancy results in a situation where HeteroFL leaves a significant proportion of global full model parameters untrained. Similarly, FedRolex exacerbates the model drift problem by not training a considerable number of global full model parameters between communication rounds. Given that these methodologies primarily concentrate on the splitting scheme and do not address the model drift issue, their performance is notably compromised when collaboratively training larger models. To better elucidate these observations, we have included the following explanation in revision Section 5.1. \n\n**In NLP tasks, MSfusion significantly outperforms HeteroFL and FedRolex. The suboptimal performance of HeteroFL and FedRolex in collaborative training larger models is due to untrained global model parameters and exacerbated model drift, issues unaddressed in their splitting-focused methodologies. This emphasizes the advantage of MSfusion in handling larger models more effectively.**"
