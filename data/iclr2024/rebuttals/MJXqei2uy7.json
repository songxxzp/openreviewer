                    "value": "The paper explores how to align LLMs with human preference. It presents empirical results on two public datasets (one conversational dialog one from Anthropic, and one on the summarisation of reddit posts from OpenAI) which each have two targets, one a \"good\" and a \"bad\" response. \nThe paper talks about how RLHF and the more recent DPO formulation are lacking in that they only allow binary preferences. It proposes to do alignment instead via control codes, ie a prompt which is either static text encoded per the LLMs tokenisation+embedding, or learnt embedding of the same dimension as the LLMs embeddings. There has been lots of related work, e.g. the non-cited CTRL paper, which uses control codes for controllable generation (e.g. to control style, or sentiment of generated text), however this paper is novel I believe in looking at this for aligning an LLM produced via unsupervised learning. \n\nThe paper however is limited in that it blends in param efficiency of the prompt, which IMHO appears to be a different topic entirely, and the results on binary pref data are not convincingly better than the more rigorous DPO, nor are results given on non-binary preference which is purported to be a benefit of the proposed method."

It is focussed on alignment, and presents a valid question on whether alignment can be achieved via control codes (static, or trained, ie soft-prompt-learning). However it introduces parameter efficiency, and IMHO I see no rationale for how this relates. The question of how to align an LLM can be addressed separately to requiring the learnt control codes to come from LORA adapted models or otherwise. \n* Despite criticising some existing alignment works for being restricted to only optimising against binary ratings, the paper does not present any results on using control code based alignment to power non-binary preferences. \n* Minor suggestion: Equation 2 is literally the same as equation 1. It's just the perspective one takes when looking at it (optimise LLM params, or optimise prompt params). This could be better written, and without the use of the duplicated equation.\n* The results don't indicate that the method is reliably better than DPO. Most comparisons are given against the weaker CoH."

To do so, they adopt a two-step training procedure. First, they train a \"good control adapter\" and a \"bad control adapter\" on good answers and bad answers respectively while keeping the base LM fixed, then they fine-tune both the control adapters and the base model. The authors show that this two step procedure is important to achieve gains over the Chain of Hindsight baseline (basically a baseline where control adapters is just a handcrafted prompt \"A good/bad conversation is:\") and DPO on two datasets OpenAI Summary and HH-RLHF from Anthropic."

Moreover, the baselines numbers are a bit concerning and some important baselines are missing (overall harder to fix)"

                    "value": "About novelty:\n\nThe paper proposes to learn \"attributes\" conditional models with adapters, which have been proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08453.pdf for diffusion models for example. So, here, the novelty might reside in 1/ applying this general idea to textual generation tasks and 2/ the two-stage training approach proposed to train these adapters. The current stance of the paper is that the main novelty is to apply LoRA adapters for generation instead of hard prompts. I feel like 2/ is a more interesting and impactful contribution but currently it is a bit understated in the paper, so it feels like it should be the central focus of the paper. I feel like the paper can be an interesting set of experiments showing that the two-stage approach prevent adapters from being \"information-starved\" from full model fine-tuning.\n\nAbout experiments:\n\nConfusion about the contributions seem to appear in Section 3, where the authors tie their method to MLE loss (1) and (2) and compare in the experiments with a DPO baseline. This is a bit surprising to me given that their method can be deployed on top of DPO, i.e. Eq (1) and (2) can use DPO instead of MLE (to train each good and bad expert), so I am not sure why DPO would be a baseline in the experiments. On the contrary, I would have expected to see two versions of their method in the experiments: with Eq. (1) and (2) using DPO (MEET-DPO) and Eq. (1) and (2) using MLE (MEET-MLE).\n\nFrom all experiments, one straightforward baseline is missing in addition to CoH: SFT -- which just trains on positive data.\n\nSimilarly, for MEET-MLE, what is the impact of integrating negative data? i.e. what is the gap between MEET-SFT, which just trains the controllable adapter of positive data and MEET-MLE, which trains on both positive and negative data with Eq. 2?\n\nIn the first dataset, DPO underperforms CoH on OpenAI/Summary dataset. The fact that DPO underperforms CoH on this dataset is a bit suspicious. Did you tune the \\beta parameter for DPO on both datasets ?\n\nHow do you do cross-validation in these two datasets? Are you searching for the best HPs for each method on the validation set?\n\nTaken together, your results currently show that DPO is useless in these two datasets and severely underperform MLE training with MEET. I am not sure this result can be published without further ablations and baselines as I suggest above, especially it appears to me that MEET can be further improved with DPO training.\n\nPlease, do not consider my score as final, I am willing to increase the score substantially if the authors can give answers to my questions."

The performance of the proposed method does not show enough improvements compared to the baseline mentioned in the paper. It highly correlates to the hyperparameter settings. It would be good to include the detailed ablations of those hyperparameters. \n\n3. The proposed method seems to be not novel.

Training soft prompts before fine-tuning the model has been studied by the prior work of [promot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00635) which finds similar performance improvements on the task of summarization.\n\n3. The paper title is a little too general. Though the methods use PEFT, this is not essential to any of the results since the primary contribution is for two-stage optimization and only for the application controllable generation.
