Their objectives are twofold: to present a general framework that encompasses these past architectures, and to develop within that framework a novel generalization that possesses large storage capacity while remaining biologically plausible."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. The critical contribution of Bovier (1999) is the proof of an upper bound on the capacity, showing that the lower bound cited by the authors (which appears in earlier work, for instance Petritis (1996) \"Thermodynamic Formalism of Neural Computing\") is in fact sharp. The authors prove only lower bounds, which follow from a relatively straightforward Chernoff bound (as in Bovier or in Demircigil's study of polynomial networks). The proof of the upper bound is considerably more technically challenging, requiring a somewhat clever conditional negative dependence argument, and to my knowledge has not been extended beyond the standard Hopfield model. The authors should make this clear when they reference Bovier, and also cite the earlier work of Petritis. It would also be useful to offer some speculation regarding the possibility of proving an upper bound. \n\n2. The empirical test of the predicted capacity in Figure 1 is uncompelling, as the authors test only a single network size. They should probe multiple network sizes, and also provide evidence for the claimed exponential scaling. \n\n3. A key claim of this work is that the proposed model simultaneously enjoys superior biological plausibility compared to previously-proposed associative memory models and has a huge storage capacity. However, I have some concerns regarding their claims. First, they decompose the required $k$-fold multiplication into a sequence of $k$ pairwise multiplications, each of which is claimed to be realized by a neuron. Is their evidence for the existence of this highly structured motif in neural connectivity data? Second, to support the claim that a single neuron can compute a pairwise product, they cite work by Groschner et al. on the fly visual motion detection circuit. Despite the title, what Groschner et al. show is more precisely a form of amplification by disinhibition, which in certain limits closely approximates multiplication (this idea goes back at least to work by Torre and Poggio in 1978, which is the basis for this family of biophysically-inspired motion detection models). How sensitive is their model to departures from perfect multiplication? I can only imagine that the errors would compound over the $k$ approximate multiplications required. This is potentially a severe limitation, as the authors require $k$ to grow with $N$ in order to achieve the promised quasi-exponential capacity. \n\n4. The authors should remind the reader of their notational conventions in Appendix B, particularly the use of set-indexed variables to represent products. In this vein, why do they switch from using $\\sigma$ as the index to using $s$?\n\n5. To guide the reader, it would be useful to explicitly compare the argument used here to bound the capacity for polynomial networks to the proof by Demircigil et al. Having a concrete example would in particular make it easier to check each step of the proof quickly. \n\n6. A point of curiosity: Can this framework be easily extended to the hetero-associative memory setting? Several recent works have considered extending Dense Associative Memories to the sequence storage settings, including https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04532 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05563.\n\n7. It would be useful to mention at least briefly the framework of Millidge et al. (2022), \"Universal Hopfield Networks: A General Framework for Single-Shot Associative Memory Models,\" and contrast it with the framework proposed in the present work."

A generic \"skeleton\" defines the allowed interactions in each model, where each previously proposed model corresponds to a specific skeleton (classical model with `1:1` interactions, the polynomial model with rank d interactions, the simplical model with `(D over N)` interactions, etc.). The storage capacity, both robust and nonrobust variants, is analysed for this model family, deriving previously known results. Then, this framework is used to derive a new model (products of sums, or PSHN) where the `N` neurons are divided into `k` disjoint subsets and interactions are allowed only between `k` neurons from different subsets. It is proved that for small `k`, this model has the same capacity as the polynomial model of degree `k`, while the number of interactions is much lower, making the model amendable to efficient implementation (as a new kind of Transformer) and perhaps also biological implementations."

(-) There are no experiments to show the effectiveness of the special attention layer.\n6. (-) Computational costs/limitations under different choices of skeleton $\\mathfrak{S}$ are not discussed\n7. (-) Storage capacity tests do not consider the total number of connections, as shown in are communicated in terms of the number of feature neurons, but [Burns & Fukai](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05179) showed that it is important to compare storage capacity of different Hopfield Networks with the same total number of connections. \n\n\n**Originality**: Somewhat novel. See strengths.\n\n**Quality and Clarity**: This paper contains many benign typos and does not strive to make their proposed method accessible by including any kind of descriptive figure.\n\n**Significance**: Medium-Low. The abstraction was not characterized beyond single-step updates and binary memories, and the experimental results and storage capacity do present a noticeable improvement over existing frameworks for understanding Hopfield Networks."
