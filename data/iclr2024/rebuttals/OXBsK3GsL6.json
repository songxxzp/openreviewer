Please also check the general response, in which the revision during the rebuttal period is explained.\n\n> 1. Need comparison to some \"drop and then grow\" pruning methods in LTH like Rigging the Lottery and its following works. In the related studies, the authors explained that the difference between SLTH and LTH is that SLTH assumes there are strong subnets in dense models without training. However, the methods and experiments involve model training. Therefore, it is necessary to compare dynamic sparse training methods in LTH.\n\nThank you for providing interesting literature. Firstly, we admit that a performance gap exists between weight-based LT and SLT, and the paper should discuss this point more. Therefore, we have included a detailed discussion on the drawbacks of the SLT-based method compared to the weight-based LT in section 5. Besides we also included a comparison with weight-based LT in Appendix C.2. \n\nHowever, we would like to clarify again that SLTH still differs from LTH in the sense the weights are never updated in SLTH, which makes the SLTH unique in both intriguing properties of random neural networks and practical benefits. For practical benefit, please see the general response. Therefore, we believe that the performance gap between weight-based LT and SLT does not hinder the value of the paper. In addition, to strengthen the paper, we added an SLTH-based baseline (see general response 2-3).  \n\n> 2. Soft pruning was directly added to iEP and the best-performing learning rate rewinding setting during the experiment. Need ablation studies: (1) decompose soft pruning and iEP to examine which contributes most; (2) combine soft pruning with different variants of iterative pruning to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\nThank you for the comments. However, since the difference between Hard iEP w/ LR and Soft iEP w/ LR is whether it employs hard or soft pruning, I\u2019m afraid I think the effect of soft pruning and rewinding strategy is already decomposed in experiments. Besides, since soft pruning w/ SRw degenerated to the standard EP, we can think of the difference between EP and Soft iEP w/ LR as the difference in rewinding strategy. \n\n>3. Similar to cons 1, related studies compared in the experiment only include IteRand about iterative pruning. IteRand is not implemented with the Wide ResNet-50 setting.\n\nWe directly obtained the value from the original manuscript, which does not provide results of Wide ResNet-50. We have clarified that in the revised manuscript. Due to the lack of enough computational budget (A100 specifically), we can not conduct the experiments on ImageNet during the rebuttal. \n\n> 4. Figure 6(b) is difficult to comprehend, as the x-axis and the red and blue lines all refer to the weight remaining rate.\n\nSorry for the confusion. I have updated the explanation. To clarify, blue lines do not refer to the weight remaining ratio. It represents the transition of score ranking of each edge. Color represents whether the edges are finally selected or not. See the end of the P8 in the revised manuscript.  \n\n> 5. DST based approaches like RigL and ITOP should serve as necessary baselines for empirical comparisons.\n> 6. The comparison in Figure 5 is unfair. Although the dense network (ResNet18) has similar parameters counts with a sparse ResNet50, the former needs much less training time since the proposed sparsity is unstructured and hard for acceleration. More discussions are needed to avoid misleading.\n\nPlease check our response to the first comments. \n\n> 7. Also, the dense baseline performance is weak. Based on previous literature like https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04092.pdf, the dense ResNet-18 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 can reach ~95% and ~77%, respectively, which are ~5% and ~17% accuracies better than the ones in Figure 5.\n\nThank you for carefully reading the paper and providing detailed comment, but I\u2019m afraid the reviewer might have some sort of misunderstanding. The baseline with a lower prune ratio performs on par with the provided results, and Fig 5. of CIFAR10 does not provide a dense baseline."

The proposed technique keeps the chance for the bottom edges to be selected in each cycle and thereby effectively explores search space leading to a lower dying edge ratio. The experimentation conducted on multiple datasets showcases the effectiveness of the proposed technique."

Please also check the general response, in which the revision during the rebuttal period is explained.\n> One of the reasons for having increased popularity of the EP algorithm is its computational efficiency compared to iterative techniques.

On the other hand, we believe that the practical benefit of the SLT-based method is deployment-friendly since it only needs to store the binary matrix and random seed to generate weights. See the general response (1) and the revised introduction for a more detailed discussion. \n\nIn addition, we updated the manuscript to clarify the concerns raised by the reviewer for the fairer comparison between the SLT-based method and the dense baseline in Fig 5. See the last paragraph of P7. \n\n\n> The proposed techniques miss the multiple baselines that do not require iterative pruning but still perform exploration [1, 2, 3].

We have carefully checked the papers, but we believe they are developed in the context of weight-base LT (multicoated lottery tickets [a]). Instead, we implemented a recently proposed extension of EP, which shares the concept of the provided literature in the sense it uses multiple (cheap) tickets to improve performance. We included the comparison with [a] in section 5 and Appendix and also verified that the proposed method can be combined with [a] to improve the performance further.

We are sorry that we have not included ViT, as ViT typically requires large-scale datasets to train. In addition, as we have discussed in the original manuscript, the performance improvement tends to be larger when we use higher capacity models. See second paragraph of section 5."

It would be great to give a detailed description in formulas (Appendix should be fine) to summarize the algorithms.\n\nWe have updated the proposed method's entire description and included the pseudocode in Appendix B. \n\n> 2. Please give rationale and motivation of the higher exploration efficacy, the better performance?\n\nThank you for the question. I think Figure 2 in the manuscript explains the motivation of the higher exploration efficacy to provide performance improvement. Assume that we have target networks that are hidden in random networks. If the exploration efficacy is low, which means there exist many dying edges as with the standard EP, whether the algorithm can be reached at the solution strongly depends on the initial structure. In other words, low exploration efficiency means that they actually do not (or can not) use entire parameter spaces effectively, thus trapped to the suboptimal solution around the initial solution. Additional analysis of the structure difference among subnetworks obtained by Soft iEP, Hard iEP, and EP also supports this perspective (see Appendix C.3 and general response 3). \n\n\n\n> 3. For training such soft iEP, how does this converge compared to the hard one?\n\nThank you for the question. We have included the convergence speed of hard and soft iEP. See general response 2-7 for more explanation. \n\n> 4. Please discuss the dying ratio and pruning performance for different randomized initializations of the network.\n\nWe have added experiments on the dying ratio and burning performance for different randomized initializations of the network. For the dying ratio, we included the results of different weight and score initialization and how it affects the dying ratio and performance in section 3 (see general response 2-5). Besides we also tested the proposed iterative pruning with different weight initialization in Appendix C.2.4. \n\n> How many only visited once edges are finally retained?\n\nFollowing the reviewer's comments, we extend the analysis and compare the cumulative visit count of edges between EP and iEP. In short, EP first provides almost 10x dying edges, and Soft iEP tends to activate edges a few times. See Appendix C.3.3 for a more detailed discussion.  \n\n> To what degree are the final prune edges similar of soft and hard iEP edges? (maybe compare the edge graph similarity?)\n\nFollowing prior works investigating the mask similarity, we have investigated mask similarity among EP, Hard iEP, and Soft iEP. See appendix C.3.2 and general response 3."

The authors delve into the concept of 'dying edges,' a seemingly-newly-introduced term coined in this paper to describe edges that are consistently overlooked during the optimization process of the milestone work edge-popup (EP), which they link to the performance of the final pruned network.\n\nProviding a solid foundation, the paper lays out the necessary background for the newly proposed soft iterative edge popup (soft iEP). The authors build their case by discussing the limitations of the original iterative edge popup (iEP), particularly highlighting how the prevalence of dying edges can lead to inefficiencies. They draw a correlation between the quantity of dying edges and the test accuracy of the network.\n\nFinally, the authors demonstrate the soft iEP approach effectively lowers the dying ratio and enhances performance as well; this is evidenced by experimental results on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet using some ResNet architectures. Additionally, the paper benchmarks the proposed method against other variations of EP to provide a thorough comparison and underscore the benefits of their approach."

Specifically, this paper first explores the Edge Popup (EP) algorithm of SLTH that learns the sparse mask with a popup score, rather than update the weights, and empirically finds that EP results in a high ratio of dying edges, which is the edge that is never selected until the termination of the algorithm. As a result, the performance of the SLTH is hindered. To address this issue, this paper proposes Soft Iterative EP (Soft IEP). Soft IEP is the first attempt that applies the common iterative pruning method from LTH to SLTH. Besides, Soft IEP also suggests soft pruning, where are edges can be selected at the end of the EP. Experiments results on CIFAR and ImageNet with different architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Soft IEP."

What is the current performance gap between learning mask and learning weights.  For example, based on Figure 5, we can see that a ResNet-50 with 8 millions number of parameters only achieve a performance around 70%, while at this 66% (1 - 8 / 23) sparsity level, many previous LTH with unstructured pruning  have show that they can still almost match the performance of the dense net (~76%).

Although this paper claims that iterative pruning has not been evaluated in SLTH, the proposed idea is not exciting considering that iterative pruning has been massively explored in the LTH community. \n\n\n- The investigation of the relationship between dying ratio and performance may be unclear. This paper explores different hyperparameters to optimize EP, including batch size, learning rate, etc. However, it\u2019s unclear whether these hyper parameters themselves will hinders the performance.

Thus, the causal relationship between them (\u201c\u201dhigh dying ratio hinders the performance) cannot be verified. Besides, it\u2019s unclear why change these hyperparameters can result in different dying ratio.

                        "value": "Thank you for your insightful comments. We will answer your questions to address your concerns. Please also check the general response, in which the revision during the rebuttal period is explained.\n\n>I would suggest the authors highlight the practical benefit of SLTH, and also show the performance gap with weight-based LTH.\n\nFollowing the reviewer's comments, we have updated the introduction to discuss the practical benefit of the SLTH. In short, it is more robust to the quantization and, moreover, it can easily recover weight matrix only via random seed. Thus, only need to store binary matrix during the deployment, providing practical merits on edge device scenario. We have clarified this point mainly in the revised introduction. \n\nOn the other hand, the SLT-based method still usually underperforms the method involving weight updates like dynamic sparse training, the standard lottery tickets, and its variants. We have clarified this point as well in the experiment parts (section 5). Besides, we have conducted additional experiments to clarify this point in Appendix C.2.1; see the general response 2-1.  \n\n\n> The novelty of applying iterative pruning to the SLTH is kind of limited. Although this paper claims that iterative pruning has not been evaluated in SLTH, the proposed idea is not exciting, considering that iterative pruning has been massively explored in the LTH community.\n\nI agree that iterative pruning itself is widely used in the LTH community; however, as we have discussed in the introduction, the application to SLTH is limited. In this sense, our paper can be posed as the first empirical analysis of the effectiveness of iterative pruning on SLTH, using a variety of datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet), architecture (CNN, ResNet, ResNext, and Conv Mixer), retraining procedure (hard pruning, soft pruning, and various rewinding procedure). In addition, our main novelty is also posed in the analysis of the pitfall of the SLTH-based method (the dying edge problem). \n\n> Thus, the causal relationship between them (\"\" high dying ratio hinders the performance) cannot be verified. \n\nI'm sorry for the confusion. I agree that this part is misleading and overclaimed; thus, I revised and moved it to the appendix. We agree that it is difficult to investigate the causal relationship and thus do not intend to claim that. \n\n> Besides, it's unclear why change these hyperparameters can result in different dying ratio. It's better for this paper to illustrate their relationship.\n\nThank you for the comments. We have included the discussion on this point in appendix A.2. While it might be a bit obvious, learning rate and batch size affect the dying ratio since the larger learning rate (or equivalently smaller batch size) possibly swaps more edges. Similarly, the weight decay reduces the magnitude of the score, making it easier to swap edges with smaller gradients. \n\n> It would be advantageous to include mathematical formulations for the proposed soft edge. The current draft employs plain language to convey the concept, ensuring ease of comprehension but lacking the necessary technical rigor.\n\nThank you for the comment. As we mentioned in the general comment, we have tried to improve the technical rigor of the proposed method."
