The main benefit comes from an explicit evaluation of the entropy term thanks to the closed-form entropy of the based measure and invertiability of the transformation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on finding maximum entropy policy."

There are lots of similarities between the proposed method and [1], e.g. using SVGD to approximate the energy-based policy parameterized by the $Q$-function. In fact, if [1] does not amortize the policy, I believe it is nearly identical to the proposed methods.\n\n* I feel there are several modifications that make the proposed method alleviating from the concept of SVGD, e.g. the truncation of the particle update. Furthermore, as there will be some discretization error from the gradient flow of KL on Wasserstein space (which is the motivation of SVGD), I'm thinking if the entropy of the discretized SVGD is a proper estimate of the KL on energy-based policy. I'm also wondering that given the $Q$-function, is it possible to directly estimate the entropy of the energy-based policy, which potentially gets rid of the other issues.\n\n* The experimental results in fact do not beat the baseline a lot. \n\n[1] Liu, Yang, et al. \"Stein variational policy gradient.\" 33rd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2017"

                        "value": "- **Reference [1]:**\n  Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We actually intended to cite [1] in the SVGD-augmented RL paragraph (last paragraph in related work on page 9) but we ended up citing a different paper by referencing liu2017stein (identical first author, year, and first word of title). Lines 2-4 are actually comparing [1] to our work. Our work is fundamentally different. In [1], the authors learn a multi-modal distribution over the policy parameters ($\\theta$) space, while we learn a single policy with multi-modal action ($a$) spaces. We argue that learning a multi-modal distribution over $\\theta$ following [1] doesn't necessarily result in learning diverse policies as it's possible to learn the same mapping from states to actions using different parameterizations due to local-minima symmetries in the deepnet loss function. In contrast, learning multi-modal distributions over action spaces results in diverse actions by design. Besides, in real-world setups, we would like to follow the optimal policy and have the possibility to pick a suboptimal action in case of test-time perturbation, without completely switching to a different policy (with a different parametrization $\\theta$). We fixed the citation.\n\n- **Particles truncation:**\n  We did not implement the constraint in Eq.9 by truncating the particles to be within 3 std of the mean. Since we use the change of variable formula, we can only apply invertible transformations on the particles (truncation is not invertible). Instead, we sample more particles than we need to select the ones that stay within the range. Since the Q-landscapes become smoother as the training progresses (entropy maximization effect), there are always enough particles to satisfy the constraint. We added this clarification on page 9 under Eq 9.\n\n- **Estimating the entropy of EBMs:**\n  Estimating the entropy of EBMs ($p(x) = \\exp{E(x)}/Z$, $E(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an energy function) would require evaluating the intractable partition function $Z$ (integration over an infinite number of configurations of $x$). Hence, directly computing the entropy of EBMs is intractable. In Sec B.2 of the appendix, we review previous approaches approximating this quantity and elaborate on how they compare to our method.\n\n- **MuJoCo experiments:**\n  We updated our experiments. Please check the common reply."

Is this a typo (as well as in Equation (3))?\n\nTheorem 3.1 is not rigorous. My main concern is around the condition $\\epsilon \\lVert \\nabla h \\rVert_{\\infty} \\ll 1$. First, this is not a precise statement. Second, under this condition, Equation (10) cannot hold with equality (as already displayed in the appendix, there is an approximately equal argument). My suggestion is to either make a precise statement articulating the relationship between the condition and the final assertion to respect the rigor of a theorem, or make it casual by changing it to be a claim with approximate equality. Afterall, this theorem serves as a benign consequence of preserving the invertibility and as a motivation to properly choose $\\sigma$.\n\nIn Proposition 3.2, it is better to recall the definition of $\\sigma$, as there is an ambiguity of $\\sigma$ being the variance of Gaussian or kernel function.\n\n2. Claims in empirical results\n\nI am not confident in the claim that \"This empirically confirms that SGLD, DLD, and HMC update rules are not invertible\" (beginning of page 7) can be obtained from the entropy is not accurately estimated. Can authors provide more context around it? Moreover, why the target distribution is chosen so, as the mean and covariance are not natural (mean $[-0.69, 0.8]$, and variance ...).\n\nI would suggest to avoid the claim of \"maximizing the future reward and maximizing the future entropy\". The objective in Equation (2) only maximizes the sum of the future reward and future entropy, which is not to maximize both terms."

By convention (e.g., in the Sutton-Barto RL book and the SQL paper), we omitted the transition probability for simplicity.\n\n2. Thanks. We added a discount factor. We originally followed the notation in the SAC paper which omits the discount factor. We agree that it's more rigorous this way.\n\n3. We added the proof to Appendix D. On a high level, given the definition of the soft Q-function (Eq. 17), we introduce the Lagrangian of the MaxEnt objective (Eq. 16) by incorporating the constraint $\\int_a \\pi(a|s)=1$. Computing the derivative w.r.t $\\pi(a|s)$ for a given action $a$ and state $s$ results in the exponential policy in Eq. 19. Finally, we choose the Lagrange multiplier such that the obtained distribution sums to one (Eq. 20). We obtain $\\pi(a|s)= \\exp{( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} Q(s,a) )}/Z$. $\\alpha$ was previously hidden in $Z$. We revised it to reflect the dependency on $\\alpha$ in Eq. 3.\n\n4. That is correct. We revised it.\n\n5. Thanks. We added it.\n\n6. We added the proof in Appendix E. We added the definition of $\\mathcal{D}$ (replay buffer) and fixed the typo ($Q(s_t,a_t)$ instead of $Q(s_t|a_t)$).\n\n7. Great point. We changed to using the approximation sign instead and added the order of the approximation error $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^2 Ld)$. $L$ is the number of SVGD steps and $d$ is the action dimension.\n\n8. Thanks. We clarified. The HMC update rule is only invertible with respect to the $(a,v)$ (Neal et al. (2011)), i.e., when conditioning on $v$. Since $v$ is sampled from a random distribution, it has the effect of the noise variable in SGLD. Hence, HMC is not invertible w.r.t $a$.\n\n9. Yes, we added the citation.\n\n10. Thanks. Corrected."

They show that both SQL and SAC can be recovered with small modifications over S2AC. The authors then conducted experiments to verify the capability of S2AC in estimating entropy, in learning multimodal policies and maximizing entropy, as well as its performance in MuJoCo tasks."

In summary, previous techniques are either based on heuristic approximation (e.g., computing pairwise distance between samples as a proxy for smoothness), lower bounds, or neural estimators of mutual information.\n\nDifferently, our approach is: (1) more principled as it computes the entropy of the actor (as opposed to using off-the-shelf generic tricks) by exploiting the invertibility of the SVGD update and the change of variable formula, (2) more parameter-efficient (we only learn a Gaussian initial distribution).\n\n**Generalizing $S^2AC$ to discrete settings**\n\nGeneralizing $S^2AC$ to discrete settings is non-trivial as SVGD is by default a sampler for continuous probabilities. Since the actions in discrete setups are **finite** and pre-defined, the policy is a softmax distribution with dimensions corresponding to the number of actions. Hence, the entropy can be obtained by computing the empirical mean of the negative log-likelihood of this distribution over all actions."

How much does the increased expressiveness of the stochastic policy  (at the cost of computation) matter? The authors could only show significant differences to existing methods on hand-crafted toy problems. For the traditional benchmarks, i.e. Mujoco the method does not appear to perform better than standard approaches such as PPO. The problem here, is not the fact that it not performs better, but that it appears better experiments could be designed to show how large/if there is a significant advantage.\n\nThe general arguments for stochastic policies are, to my knowledge e.g.  \"multi-modality also has application in real robot tasks, as demonstrated in (Daniel et al., 2012) Quote taken from SAC paper. Additionally, as the authors write themselves: \"this enables better explo-\nration during training and eventually better robustness to environmental perturbations at test time, i.e., the agent learns multimodal action space distributions which enables picking the next best action in case a perturbation prevents the execution of the optimal one.\"\n\nIf that is the argumentation I would expect the authors to design experiments under these scenarios that are not toy.  This could have been achieved for instance by  augmenting the MuJoCo tasks with perturbation events that prevent execution of certain actions in certain situations. Then a more expressive stochastic policy could perform better.  For now it makes it hard to asses if the increase time- and algorithmic complexity is worth the cost of obtaining better performing policies."

                        "value": "**Amortized $S^2AC$**\n\nResults are added to Fig. 8 ($S^2AC(\\phi,\\theta,\\psi)$). There is a small tradeoff in performance for 3 times faster inference compared to the non-amortized version ($S^2AC(\\phi,\\theta)$). Yet, the improvement over the baselines is still statistically significant (Fig.8 f-j). We added more details on the amortized version in Sec. 3.4. Note that the amortization is just a trick to improve the **test-time**. Specifically, amortized S2AC is just training a feedforward network $f_{\\psi}(s,z)$ (Eq.24-25) to mimic the rolled-out (non-amortized policy) as test time (L.15, Alg2). **During training**, we need to use the unrolled policy to be able to compute the entropy estimate of the sampler in the MaxEnt RL objective (L.11-12 in Alg2). Depending on the application, it can be used as the main method, at test time, i.e., if timely reactivity is important (e.g., robot manipulation tasks). In other setups where the accuracy matters more (e.g., medical diagnosis), the unrolled policy would enable checking the Stein identity to assess convergence.\n\n**Results of Amortized $S^2AC$ on multi-goal** are reported in Fig.17.\n\n**Significance on complex environment**: Humanoid-v2 (Fig. 8-e) is a multi-modal environment (the action space is 17 dimensional with a large number of continuous control factors including combinations of legs and arms movements, posture, $\\cdots$). Note that our approach (violet) is more sample efficient and performs better than SAC (red) due to the improved ability to explore different local optima. We thought about testing robustness by modifying the humanoid environment, for instance by freezing some variables in the action space to force the robot into a different forward movement mode. This is, however, non-trivial as it impacts the robot's balance. We agree, as RL algorithms are being deployed in real-world setups, ensuring the robustness of these agents is becoming increasingly important. We added a sentence in the conclusion to encourage the community to invest more in this direction."

                        "value": "**[Amortized S$^2$AC]**\n\nWe added more details in Sec 4.3 (run-time). The full description is as follows. Unfortunately, we cannot include all the details in the main manuscript because of the strict page limit, and it has been a tough decision to put them into the appendix.\n\nBasically, we train a deepnet $f_{\\psi}(s,z)$ to mimic the SVGD dynamics during testing, where $z$ is a random vector that allows mapping the same state to different particles. One way to train $f_{\\psi}(s,z)$ is to run SVGD to convergence and train $f_{\\psi}(s,z)$ to fit SVGD outputs. This, however, requires collecting a large training set of state action pairs by repeatedly deploying the policy. This might be slow and result in low coverage of the states that are rarely visited by the learned policy and hence lead to poor robustness in case of test time perturbations. We instead propose an incremental approach in which $\\psi$ is iteratively adjusted so that the network output $a = f_{\\psi}(s,z)$ changes along the Stein variational gradient direction that decreases the KL divergence between the policy and the EBM distribution, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\psi}(z,s) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} k(a_{i}, f_{\\psi}(s,z)) \\nabla_{a_i} Q(s,a_i) + \\alpha \\nabla_{a_i}k(a_i,f_{\\psi}(s,z))  \n$$\n\nNote that $\\Delta f_{\\psi}$ is the optimal direction in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and is thus not strictly the gradient of Eq.(5), but it still serves a good approximation, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial a_t} \\propto \\Delta f_{\\psi}$, as explained by Wang & Liu (2016). Thus, we can use the chain rule and backpropagate the Stein variational gradient into the policy network according to\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J(s)}{\\partial \\psi} \\propto E_{z} \\left[ \\Delta f_{\\psi}(s,z)  \\frac{\\partial f_{\\psi}(z,s)}{\\partial \\psi}  \\right].\n$$\n\nto learn the optimal sampling network parameters $\\psi^{*}$. Note that the amortized network takes advantage of a Q-value that estimates the expected future entropy which we compute via unrolling the SVGD steps. The modified \\STAC\\ algorithm is described in Algorithm 2.\n\n**[Scalability of SVGD with respect to dimensionality]**\n\nTheoretically, SVGD does suffer from the curse of dimensionality for arbitrary distributions. But empirically, S$^2$AC($\\phi$, $\\theta$) works well on the MuJoCo benchmarks with high-dimension action spaces, e.g., the Humanoid environment with a 17-dimensional action space. This may depend on the specific shape of the distribution, and the fact that we have a **parameterized initialization** of the initial particle distribution has greatly mitigated the issue since it learns to focus on the sub-spaces for action/particle sampling. Notice the difference in performance between the parametrized S$^2$AC($\\phi$, $\\theta$) and non-parametrized S$^2$AC($\\phi$) versions in Fig. 8. In the future, we aim to further improve the scalability by stacking multiple SVGD-induced distributions in a diffusion model style."

This is achieved by using a Stein Variational\nGradient Descent sampler. A neural network parameterizes the mean and variance\nof the initial distribution of the sampler. Moreover, the samples produced\nby the SVGD method are restricted to lie within 3 standard deviations of the\ninitial distribution. The policies entropy can be computed thanks to the\nSVGD sampling process being invertible, similar to how a normalizing flow\nworks.\n\nThere are experiments to check the correctness of the formulation in simple 2D landscape fitting tasks. Moreover, they perform experiments\non 5 MuJoCo benchmark tasks. The performance seems similar to SAC in\n4/5 tasks, and better in one of the tasks.\n\n**Update**\n____________________________\n\nThanks for the extensive update.\n\nMany things improved, but I also still have concerns.\n\nMainly, the rebuttal claims: \"SSPG ... Specifically, the middle plot in Fig. 4(A) is an identical setup to the Multi-goal environment in Fig. 2 in our paper.\" But this does not seem to be true. The task in the SSPG is a bandit problem with only 1 environment step (and the action selects the location on the landscape); hence, there is no \"future entropy\" as there is just one step in the environment. Whereas in the current paper, there is an agent that moves around on the landscape, so the tasks are different. I see no reason why SSPG would also not be able to maximize the future entropy, as it uses a soft critic that includes the future entropy similarly to this paper.\n\nAnother concern is that your re-implementation of SAC-NF does not improve over SAC, whereas it did in the references, both in the SAC and REDQ cases, so perhaps your implementation is not well-performing.\n\nWhile the use of the rliable library was a good step to improve the analysis, there is a fairly large overlap in the error bars for SAC and your newly proposed method. As the number of random number seed experiments per environment was 5, I think this should be increased to reduce the error bars and receive a more reliable result.\n\nBased on the above, I decided to keep my score. What may have changed my assessment would have been performing more experiments so that the statistical significance of the results is clear (this would have increased my score to 5), not making claims that the setup is the same as the one in SSPG, better results for SAC-NF, etc. However, I will increase the contribution rating by 1 point, as I think there are also other contributions in the work.\n\n[3] SSPG: \"Policy Gradient With Serial Markov Chain Reasoning\""

                        "value": "Thank you for sharing the references. We tried to conduct an extensive literature review, but these references were missed because their titles/abstracts do not indicate a strong relation to our work.\n\nWe carefully studied them. \n\n**TL;DR: MaxEnt RL is not just about multimodality**. First, we want to emphasize that our goal is to find a better solution to the MaxEnt RL objective due to its nice properties. Notably, beyond better exploration and multi-modality, MaxEnt RL is provably *robust*. This is achieved by maximizing the future entropy (positive reward setup) and is a highly desired property in real-world applications. Our empirical experiments (Fig. 6) validate that $S^2AC$ is not only multi-modal but also robust. This is, however, not the case for Ref [1-5]. Next, we argue that **Refs [1,2]** solve different objectives that lead to multi-modal policies but do not optimize for robustness. While **Refs [3,4,5]** optimize the MaxEnt RL objective, the learned policies fail to maximize the expected future entropy because of approximations (**Ref [3]**), the instability of training flow models (**Ref [4]**), or modeling the policy as uni-modal Gaussian (**Ref [5]**). We included **a comparison to these methods** in the intro and related work sections. We also **re-implemented Ref [4]** for comparison in both the Multi-goal and MuJoCo experiments (their code is not available). \n\nDetailed clarifications are as follows.\n\n**Refs [1,2] optimize different objectives from MaxEnt RL.** **Ref [1]** optimizes Trusted Region Policy Optimization with a KL-divergence constraint. **Ref [2]** solves a new ELBO (Eq2) which is inspired but different from the MaxEnt RL objective. Specifically, it introduces additional latent variables and follows a model-based formulation.\n\n**Refs [3,4,5] fail to maximize the future entropy.**\n- **SSPG (Ref [3])** models the policy as a Markov chain with transition probabilities being parametrized Gaussians, which enables computing an approximation of the policy gradient (Eq. 13). The experimental results in Figure 4(A) don't demonstrate maximizing the future entropy. Specifically, *the middle plot in Fig. 4(A)* is an identical setup to the Multi-goal environment in Fig. 2 in our paper. As stated by the authors (lines 9-10 of Sec. 4.2), SSPG learns to visit the goals with *similar frequencies*. However, a good solution to the MaxEnt RL objective would be biased towards sampling from the lower modes. Hence, it seems that SSPG has just led to better exploration without robustness benefits. We wanted to further investigate, but the author didn't provide the code (empty link). In contrast, we show that explicitly computing the entropy leads to more optimal MaxEnt RL solutions (Fig. 2), *i.e., to maximizing the expected future entropy*.\n- **SAC-NF (Ref [4])** models the policy as a normalizing flow (NF). **We re-implemented the paper** (their code was not provided) and reported results on both the Multi-goal (**Figs. 6-7**) and MuJoCo envs (**Fig. 8**). On Multi-goal, SAC-NF learns to maximize the entropy but, unlike our approach, it misses one mode for smaller $\\alpha$ values. We argue that this is due to normalizing flow well-known tendency to quickly collapse to local optima Kobyzev et al. (2020) (in accordance with Fig. 4(A) in Ref[3]). The dispersion term in S2AC encodes an inductive bias to mitigate this issue. On MujoCo, convergence is slower and performance is lower than our approach. **Note that the reported results in Ref [3] are from applying NFs over REDQ (Table 5)**.\n- **IAP (Ref [5])** models the policy as a uni-modal Gaussian (Sec. 4.1). Multi-modality is achieved by learning a collection of parameter estimates (mean, variance) through different initializations (Figure 2 and Sec. 3.2). The estimates result in parametrizing different policies. This doesn't result in maximizing the entropy and hence doesn't lead to robustness.\n\n**Eq 5 in Ref [1]** is the Change of Variable Formula (CVF), which we use as a tool given that SVGD is invertible (similarly to normalizing flows). Our theoretical contribution consists of (1) proving that SVGD is invertible which enables the use of CVF, (2) using CVF together with the corollary of Jacobi\u2019s formula to derive a closed-form expression of the SVGD log-likelihood (Eq 10), (3) deriving an equivalent computationally efficient expression of Eq. 10 (evaluates the trace of the Jacobian) that only depends on first order derivatives and vector dot products (Eq. 11) and (4) optimizing for scalability via parameterizing Eq. 11.\n\n**Experiments.** We updated our experiments.
