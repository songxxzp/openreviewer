                    "value": "Level progress is a confusing term for curriculum learning researchers. \u201cLearning progress\u201d or \u201ccompetence progress\u201d is a standard proposition of intrinsic motivation to guide curricula, it refers to the derivative of the competence measure with respect to time: how much the competence increases or decreases. Here you use the term \u201cprogress\u201d but it refers to what people call \u201ccompetence,\u201d a measure of success, a score. For instance, if you play the same level 10 times and reach the same score each time, there is no progress at all across-episodes, the progress is only intra-episode. I know that level progress describes what you expect it to describe in the language of video games, but it\u2019s confusing for researchers in this field: I thought you meant learning progress for the first 4-5 pages. Could you consider using another term? Competence is the standard term I think, score or performance could be good as well.\n\nThe hypothesis supported here is not very clearly stated. I can see several alternative hypotheses that could explain the data:\n* Children have some form of heuristic curriculum strategy that would look a bit like this: if i\u2019m very good, i switch to a harder task, if i intermediate I stay there, if i\u2019m bad i either stay or try something easier. \n* Children have a causal understanding of the world and maximize their causal learning\n* Children have an intermediate difficulty bias (~Florensa\u2019s paper): they keep doing the task for which they have intermediate competence / performance. \n* Children have a bias towards learning progress: they can estimate expected learning progress in a model-based way and select the task that maximizes it. When a game is solved there is no further learning progress so they switch up, when they perform poorly they might expect more progress soon and stay, or not expect progress and recalibrate their estimations, which leads them to switch down.\n\nI feel like the paper is arguing for the second interpretation, although it\u2019s not stated clearly. I don\u2019t see anything in the paper that would allow us to argue for one more than the others?\n\nAn interesting experiment could be to include levels from games different from the target game level. If children optimize for learning progress only, then we should see children select easy levels of the non-target games as well. Instead, we would probably see children almost never select the irrelevant game, which argues for a combination of intrinsic (LP-like) and extrinsic (going for the target level) curriculum. \n\nRL experiments:\n* The switch threshold appears to be an important hyperparameter, it would be interesting to see how it affects the results: .9 seems high given that children seem to switch up around 75%.\n* I\u2019m not 100% sure I understand the manual curriculum: \n* why is there 16 parallel tasks?\n* what does it mean to increment the difficulty by 1/16? I thought the difficulty was the number of lanes (1\u20135)? if the agent passes 0.9 in the current level (eg 1 lane), I expect the 16 tasks to become 2-lane tasks and the agent to be trained on these? Here it sounds like one of the 16 tasks becomes a lane-2 task, but then how is compute the score metric now? It it computed as the average level progress over the 16 taks (15 1-lane and 1 2-lane)?\n* You use an on-policy algorithm that does not leverage a replay buffer. This means that old data from easier levels are thrown away. Using an off-policy algorithm (eg DDPG) would reuse past data, which may mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem?\n\nCatastrophic forgetting for curriculum learning is a known problem, which is why all curriculum approaches perform stochastic selection: they do not switch from one level to the other but sample all levels with varying probabilities that are a function of the intrinsic motivation. Eg selecting the current best level with probability .7 and the rest with .3 / n_other_levels may fix the issue, see Jiang\u2019s paper and Colas 2019 for examples.\n\nStudies of curriculum algorithms always include the presentation of the random baseline selecting level uniformly. This baseline does not suffer from distribution shifts. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how the intrinsic reward is used here. As far as I understand, it seems that the curriculum (level selection) is the same as before but that PPO now uses what the so-called intrinsic reward in addition, right?\nIf so, this is a problem. Intrinsic motivations must be agnostic of the goal (this is what intrinsic means). They can be either state-based: assigning an intrinsic reward to states; or goal-based: assigning an intrinsic reward to goals / tasks.\nWhat you propose is to assign a reward to a state, but this reward is extrinsic, it measures performance in the task. Practically, you\u2019ve just replaced a sparse reward with a dense reward, no intrinsic motivation here.\nWhat curriculum people do in that situation usually is to use that competence measure to guide the level-selection (goal-based reward): the level selected could be the one where there is the most progress (score now vs score before, not the level progress), or the one where the competence (level progress) is intermediate. These rewards are extrinsic because they are not tied to particular levels: the level-selector only cares about learning progress or intermediate difficulty, not about any level in particular. This would involve using a bandit algorithm to explore levels and maximize that score. \n\nThe idea of a causal curriculum is interesting, but the papers cited when discussing this topic do not engage with any form of causality: eg Florensa 2018, Sukhbaatar 2017, Bengio 2009.\n\nA good way of discussing curriculum approaches is by making explicit the distal objective of the curriculum (maximizing performance on a set of target tasks), describing the proximal objective optimized by the approach (which usually includes forms of intrinsic motivation), and discussing what is the control parameter (the part of the MDP that is varied to maximize the proximal objective), see framework from Portelas et al 2020. Proximal objectives include: novelty, intermediate difficulty, learning progress, things that can be varied include: state space, transition space, goals, rewards, etc. The current review is not very clearly structured and omits large chunks of the field (eg learning progress maximizing methods). These are probably the closest to the one proposed in this paper so they should be mentioned. In particular, this paper proposes a curriculum over tasks (variation of state space, and transition function) where the proximal objective is an intermediate difficulty (intermediate level progress). \n\nWhat I would need to update my score:\n* Further details and explanations for the points raised above\n* Better account of existing curriculum approaches\n* Explicit statement about the hypothesis proposed here + discussion about how the result support that hypothesis, and may or may not bring sufficient evidence to separate the different hypotheses i listed above\n* I may have understood it wrong, but it seems that the authors completely missed the mark on the curriculum RL implementations: missing random baseline, deterministic level sampling instead of stochastic ones that's common in the field and, more importantly, the reward used is extrinsic and not intrinsic. It should be a goal-based reward and not a state-based reward. Again I may have understood it wrong so i'm open to discussions. \n\nI believe that this setup is interesting and the scientific goal is good. I'm looking forward to future improved versions of this paper. \n\n\nMinor comments: \n* Vygotsky\u2019s citation is broken (missing y, no year)."

                        "value": "We thank you for your detailed feedback and suggestions. Your suggestions on the writing and experiments helped us to improve our paper, we hope to address your questions and concerns here.\n\n**Regarding the terminology of \u2018level progress\u2019.**\n\nWe very much appreciate your  suggestion to better define level progress and other key terms for our paper. We have revised the terminology from \u2018level progress\u2019 to \u2018level competence\u2019, to reflect that this is not a derivative, but rather the current level of success the agent/ human achieves on the level. We have also written up more precisely defined definitions (see General Comments above). \n\n**Level Competence**: An indicator of success in an episode of game play on a specific level, reaching 100% when the specific level is successfully solved in that episode. (Note: This is the term formerly referred to as 'level progress.') \n\n**Global Competence**: A measure of success in an episode of game play with respect to the target level, reaching 100% if the target level is successfully solved in that episode.\n\n**Level Advancement**: Difference between current level competence and initial level competence within a particular level in the curriculum; it is a measure of how much competence increases or decreases in the same level\n\n**Global Advancement**:  Difference between current global competence and initial global competence across levels in the curriculum; it is a measure of how much competence increases or decreases with respect to achieving the target level\nAuxiliary reward: A scaled level competence\n\n**Regarding the alternative hypotheses that could explain the data.**\n\nWe very much appreciate the suggestion to make our hypothesis more explicit, and we appreciate the reviewer for diligently differentiating between the hypotheses. The reviewer is correct in their understanding of what our proposed hypothesis is: Children have a causal understanding of the world and maximize their causal learning for a given goal (i.e., solving the target level). We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion \u201cto include levels from games different from the target game level.\u201d We are currently collecting data for a follow-up study that addresses this question. We have a version of this study where we add an irrelevant \u201cnon-causal\u201d axis, e.g., changing the color shades, and easy levels from other games. We will mention this follow-up study in the work. As an additional response to the reviewer\u2019s question about examples of when children almost never select the irrelevant game, it can also be seen with our addition of the extra difficult level 4 (with the target being level 3) in the game design. Solving level 4 can be argued as irrelevant because it takes more unnecessary effort and does not help children achieve the extrinsic goal and win a sticker. We find that the majority of children never select the irrelevant, overly-difficult level 4 for building their curriculum to solve the target level. \n\nWe also ran additional exploratory analyses to address your third and fourth alternative hypotheses:\nOn intermediate difficulty bias: because the easier levels are direct subsets of harder levels in the games Leaper and Climber, we can calculate competence on easier levels as a percentage of competence in the target level to get global competence for each episode. We can then also determine which level children should objectively choose next by comparing their global competence with the percentage of the target level that each easier level represents. Here, we found that half of the time children were making objective choices, but another half of the time children chose harder levels than what they should objectively choose, suggesting that they have an intermediate to high difficulty bias that is likely also driven by the desire to causally solve the difficult target level\nOn bias towards learning progress: we ran further analyses and found that children do not have a bias towards learning progress or advancement: our child participants neither used global advancement nor level advancement (as defined in our definitions in the General Comments) to guide their choice of next level to play, suggesting that they are not driven by how much progress they have made, but more by how well they are currently performing to move towards the goal (as demonstrated by our statistics on local competence guiding next level change)\nWe will revise our paper to clearly state our hypothesis and include statistics of these additional findings.\n\n**Regarding the broken citation.**\n\nWe fixed the broken Vygotsky citation, thank you for letting us know."

                        "value": "**Regarding additional baselines**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for their suggestion on baselines to run. Please see the general comments for the baselines we are currently running and will report back on.\n\nWe agree that the switch threshold is an important hyperparameter. We are also interested in seeing the results and will report back what we learn.\n\nTo clarify the manual curriculum, there are 16 parallel tasks so that the agent can collect data more efficiently by interacting in parallel across 16 tasks. When we increment the difficulty by 1/16, this means that, of the 16 parallel tasks, one of the tasks has the difficulty incremented (and the others do not change). So, the progression would be 1) 16 1-lanes, 2) 15 1-lanes and 1 2-lane, 3) 14 1-lanes and 2 2-lanes, etc. We did originally experiment with switching all 16 tasks by one difficulty, but we found that this posed a sizable distribution shift to the agent that caused training divergence at much easier difficulties than if the difficulty was instead incremented by 1/16. However, we did notice as in Section 5.3 that training divergence does eventually occur. In Section 5.4, the level progress used in the auxiliary reward is calculated at the termination of an episode and then added to the extrinsic reward. For cases where we present average episode level progress (e.g., Figure 6b), this is calculated by taking the mean level progress over all finished episodes between policy updates.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion for trying an off-policy algorithm that uses a replay buffer. In the baselines that we just ran, we found that stochastically sampling previously solved levels indeed mitigates the catastrophic forgetting issue, however, progress made within the curriculum / towards solving the goal level is less than what we found in Section 5.4."

I first thought the first was meant but now think the second is.\n\nI'm not sure I understand why changing the color shades would be a non-causal axis? Sounds like color is not causally related to anything to if the children were indeed to optimize for learning to improve on the target level they should sample these levels with different colors as well?\n\nI guess if you want to distinguish the different hypotheses, you might fit each of the models on part of the children and see how these model predict the level choices of the rest of the children?\neg. fit the intermediate difficulty thresholds on part of the children + then use that to predict the other's choices, another main parameter here is the window length: how many episode do you average to compute the given competence? just the last one or several?\nwhat would be the predictions of your causal model? when should a causal learner pick each of the levels?\n\nNote that learning progress approaches use a local measure of learning progress, not progress since the start (same window length parameters, eg was i better in the last 3 episodes that i was in the previous 3?)"

                        "value": "I'm still unclear about the intrinsic reward.\n\nAs I pointed out, it's not really intrinsic so it was renamed auxiliary reward. Am I right to understand that it rewards each step proportionally to progress in the current level?\n\nIf so, this sounds unrelated to curriculum learning questions, it's just a way of doing reward shaping: having a dense rewards obviously outperforms sparse rewards alone, and it has nothing to do with level choices. \n\nSo what is the curriculum part (level selection policy) of the suggested algorithm? \n\nDefining an RL algorithm on this tasks requires two things: a reward function, a level selection policy. \n\n* Switching a sparse reward for a dense one is obviously going to help a lot, especially since the dense reward is not deceptive in this case. This is reward shaping, not curriculum learning, and I'm not sure I see the relationship between this change and the human experiments.\n* the human experiments seem to argue that children have a grasp of which levels are easier than others and have an intuitive sense of 'i should train on easier levels first': this is about level selection policy. Here you can compare different ones: maximizing intermediate difficulty, LP, random, hand-defined heuristic curriculum (if score>X, then switch to harder). What is exactly the new proposition made in this paper for the level selection policy? Each of these should be implemented with the same reward functions (either only dense, or only sparse, or both, but constant across level selection policies)."

A child or an agent learns the game as a causal curriculum by choosing how to move along the difficulty axis. We consider changing the color shades to be a non-causal axis because there is no causal relationship between color shade and winning the game. Color does not have any significant causal power or insight in the game for achieving the target level.\n\nIn our experiment setup, each child is subject to only a maximum of 10 rounds of automated curriculum learning; in every round they have the choice to select any of the game levels. Many children even solved the target level and terminated in less than 10 rounds (the average total number of rounds played is 7 across participants, with the minimum being 3). Thus, we do not have enough statistical power at the moment to adopt existing learning progress approaches (e.g., comparison between last 3 rounds and previous 3 rounds within a level) in our measure of progress or advancement. To circumvent this, we calculated level competence as just the competence in the active episode, and level advancement as the difference between the most recent episode and the initial episode of the same level. \n\nWhile we only have 22 children and are underpowered to do model fitting and model predictions, we have built linear mixed effects models to compare various hypotheses, and found that our data can be best explained by the idea that \u201cchildren have a causal understanding of the world and use their level competence to guide their causal curriculum learning for a given goal (i.e., solving the target level)\u201d (this model has the lowest AIC and BIC). After further examination of the data, intermediate difficulty bias and level advancement (not computed as the classic learning progress due to limited data per individual participant) so far did not explain much of child behavior - a notable portion of children seemed to remain at the same level or move to higher levels even when they had very low level competence or negative level advancement because they were motivated to achieve the extrinsic goal of solving the target level, but we have yet to collect more data to confirm this idea. \n\nOnce we have collected enough data, we will definitely try adopting your recommendations on fitting different models with some portion of child data and using them to predict other children!"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their time to follow up with additional comments for the RL experiments.\n\nRegarding the auxiliary reward, at the end of each episode, the agent receives a reward that is the sum of 1) an extrinsic reward (which, in this case, only occurs if the level is solved) and 2) the current advancement of the agent within the level. The agent only receives these rewards at the end of an episode, not at each step. We agree that the consequence of providing such an auxiliary reward is that it \u201cdensifies\u201d the rewards.\n\nAlthough it is not directly curriculum learning, we see that it impacts curriculum learning results. Having such a reward helps prevent forgetting which arises due to the distribution shift induced by switching levels. It may not be the only way to prevent forgetting, but having the auxiliary reward appears promising to both prevent forgetting and advance the curriculum. In the baseline experiment we recently conducted using a stochastic curriculum with sampling previously solved levels, we see that forgetting was also avoided, but the agent made less progress within the curriculum than with auxiliary rewards.\n\nThe relationship between the auxiliary reward in the RL experiments and the human experiments is that we observed that the children\u2019s competence within a level improved without necessarily solving the level. The analogy for the RL agent is that if there was an additional reward besides the sparse extrinsic reward that could help with learning, the agent could potentially learn more effectively than with extrinsic rewards alone.\n\nAt the present time, our RL experiments were conducted using a hand-specified curriculum. In future work, we are interested in experimenting with different level selection policies. However, our results do show that, at least for this task with sparse rewards, that other algorithmic capabilities besides level selection (e.g., capabilities for preventing forgetting that arises when switching levels) may be needed for effective curriculum learning."

                        "value": "I still disagree with the treatment of the 'auxiliary reward'. It's purely a dense version of the extrinsic reward, it is an extrinsic reward: it's assessing progress towards the resolution of the task. It helps learning for that reason (a known result), and I'm not sure in which sense it can be said to 'help curriculum learning'. \n\nBoth curriculum learning (level selection) and reward shaping impact learning (task success): the dense extrinsic reward changes reward shaping, not curriculum learning, which in turns helps learning. \n\nThe choice of providing the dense extrinsic reward only at the end of the episode and not at every step does not sound very natural to me, is there a specific reason for doing so? The RL algorithm will need to backtrack this reward to the beginning of the episode via value iteration and that sounds like a harder job then just assigning dense rewards at every step. \n\n\"The relationship between the auxiliary reward in the RL experiments and the human experiments is that we observed that the children\u2019s competence within a level improved without necessarily solving the level.\"  --> the key difference here is that children have world models and can thus anticipate future rewards they have not yet collected. Using a dense reward function slightly compensates for this by modeling 'intermediate' rewards. \n\nOverall I don't really see the point of the RL experiments: they only show that using a dense extrinsic reward works better than a sparse one (known result), and do not provide any extra insight into the particular curriculum strategy (level selection) that children follow beyond what the human experiments tell us. \n\n---\n\nI'm also still unclear about the claim of 'causal learning'. If children actually understood the true causal structure of the task, couldn't they always train on the target task? I think I've seen written somewhere that harder tasks are a superset of easier tasks: so training on easier tasks is strictly equivalent to training on the beginning of harder ones? If they prefer training on easier tasks first, we can't only explain this by saying they exploit the causal structure of the task. There must be something else: maybe they like achieving intermediate rewards, eg they could assign reward 10 for the target, 7 for level 3, these would be 'internal extrinsic rewards', as the experiment design doesn't really reward them for easy level completion? Or it could be about intrinsic motivation (LP, intermediate difficulty). As such, the experiments do not really allow to claim that children are motivated by the target task only and exploit the causal structure of the problem. If so, some of them should simply always train the target task. \n\nAnother hypotheses is that they have a 'folk model of causal learning' and have the intuition that easier level should be solved before harder ones?"

The study used Procgen environments with various difficulty levels to investigate how 5 to 7 years old children adapt to these challenges. The findings reveal that children use their progress through the levels as an intrinsic reward, motivating them to excel at easier levels before tackling harder ones. \n\nThen this paper shows that RL agents that follow a similar approach, incorporating level progress as an intrinsic reward, show better stability and convergence during training than agents relying solely on extrinsic rewards. Curriculum designed in this way also boost the sample efficiency."

We have introduced a definition table, which contains clearer explanations. These definitions are presented below. Level Competence (previously referred to as \u2018level progress\u2019): an indicator of success in an episode of playing a level, reaching 100% when the specific level is successfully solved in that episode. \n\n**Regarding authorization to do human subject experiments**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for checking on authorization to do human subject experiments. We have IRB approval to conduct human subject experiments and will include a sentence in our experimental design that the experiments have been approved by our university\u2019s IRB.\n\n**Regarding inaccessibility and generalizability of level progress**\n\nWe would appreciate it if the reviewer could clarify their concerns regarding the inaccessibility and generalizability of level progress. We agree that, in our current formulation, the use of level progress as an auxiliary reward does have the effect of providing a denser supervision signal. To the question of how we plan to access level progress, we believe the work of Bruce 2023 \u201cLearning About Progress From Experts\u201d (as mentioned by reviewer Rafo) could be extended to our domain.\n\n**Regarding the number of random seeds**\n\nAs for the RL experiments, each of the experiments in Section 5.3 and 5.4 are run over six trials each, where each trial has a unique random seed. Figure 4 and Figure 6 are from one representative trial within the six trials.\nFor Section 5.3, we consistently saw catastrophic forgetting across random seeds. The hyperparameters used were those from Jiang 2021 \u201cPrioritized Level Replay\u201d."

                        "value": "Thank you for your response. However, I am still confused about some important aspects.\n\n1. It is clear that 100% of a level progress means the completion of the level. But how do you define the progress formally when it is sth like 8%, 67%, 93%? Does there exist a unified notation of such progress for all the environments? At least in the suite of Atari games, I personally find such a level progress hard to define.\n\n2. How did you calculate the level progress in your current experiments? Is it manually assigned?\n\n3. If the experiments were conducted in multiple random trials, I am expecting to see the confidence intervals (e.g., a shaded area around the curve) instead of a single curve. And for fig.4 and fig.6, I would suggest the authors present the full results instead of hand picking a \"representative trial\", which seems not to be a good practice. You may refer to Agarwal et al. [1] for a recommend way of reporting results in RL.\n\n[1] Agarwal, Rishabh, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 29304-29320."

And this extrinsic rewards, which as also pointed out by other reviewers, doesn\u2019t have a strong connection to the curriculum learning, nor it is new. \n\nSecond, the authors seem to be oblivion to the rich, rigorous literature of causal inference. Without defining any causal models throughout the paper, somehow the paper title is claiming about \u201ccausal learning\u201d. \n\nThirdly, the experiment results reporting is biased. I still cannot be convinced that one should hand pick runs for better presentation. \n\nOverall, I\u2019ll keep the score unchanged."

We are enthusiastic about enhancing the clarity of our explanations and offering a more comprehensive understanding of our experimental setup.\n\n**Regarding additional baselines.**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for their suggestion on baselines to run. To clarify the experiments in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, the agent advances to the next level of the curriculum when the average reward obtained exceeds 9. The auxiliary reward mentioned in Section 5.4 is inspired by human curriculum learning, but the advancement of level is still just done when the average reward obtained exceeds 9. We are interested in running a baseline where the curriculum also changes based on lambda.\n\n**Regarding the number of random seeds for our RL experiments.**\n\nFor the experiments in Sections 5.3 and 5.4, six trials were used for each experiment, where each trial has a unique random seed. The results shown in Figure 4 and Figure 6 are for one representative trial within the six trials."

Does this mean that the integration of insights gained from analyzing the behavior of 5-7-year-old children in this study only provides \"how far the agent has progressed\" as an intrinsic reward?\n\nIf so, is there any difference other than changing \"sparse reward\" to \"dense reward\" that is commonly used in the RL community?\n\nAdditionally, I understood that Figure 3 illustrates not how children construct intrinsic rewards but rather how they determine transitions between levels. Nevertheless, it is regrettable that this study did not integrate such inspiration into the movement between levels. My understanding of curriculum learning primarily focuses on the consideration of which level of the task to provide, rather than how to reward. Therefore, there remains a question about whether the proposed approach can be considered curriculum learning, given that it seems to focus more on how rewards are given.\n\nThank you."

The experimental results indicate that the progress level intrinsic reward improves the curriculum learning performance."

                        "value": "We very much appreciate the reviewer\u2019s time and feedback. \n\n**Regarding the number of children in the study.**\n\nWe are collecting more data on children at the moment. There are developmental cognitive science papers that have published experiments with a sample size of about 20-30 each (e.g., see Experiment 1-3 in [3],  see Experiment 1 in [4]). (Children are much harder to recruit than adults, but they are important for understanding the bases of curriculum learning.)\n\nBut more importantly, even though 22 children looks like a small sample size, each child does not only contribute to one data point. We are interested in examining children\u2019s steps (or rounds of the game played) throughout their curriculum; within each step, we have details about which level they select, how well they perform on the specific step, etc. We currently have data for 159 steps that children made in their curricula and even when we factor in individual differences in our regression model, we are still able to find a statistically robust pattern between their level competence and their choice of next level. \n\n[1] Kushnir, T., Gopnik, A., Chernyak, N., Seiver, E., & Wellman, H. M. (2015). Developing intuitions about free will between ages four and six. Cognition, 138, 79-101.\n[2] Sobel, D. M., & Corriveau, K. H. (2010). Children monitor individuals\u2019 expertise for word learning. Child development, 81(2), 669-679.\n\n**Regarding additional baseline experiments.**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer for pointing this out.  thank the reviewer for their suggestion on baselines to run.  We have indeed conducted additional experiments, and we report the results here. First, we have conducted a baseline where environments are chosen randomly from 1-5 water lanes, without the curriculum. This is done for six trials/random seeds with a limit of 10M frames. We find that the agent makes very little learning progress over 10M frames. The return for the goal level (5 water lanes) is generally zero over the entire 10M frames. Moreover, the agent does not obtain much training return, either. We hypothesize that this is a difficult exploration problem for the agent without a curriculum, and although the agent may eventually make progress, the timescale would far exceed the 10M frame budget we used for our experiments.\n\nSecond, we conducted a baseline against Section 5.3 (curriculum without auxiliary reward) where, 30% of the time, previously solved levels are chosen based on where the agent currently is in the curriculum. For example, if the current curriculum progress is 3.5 water lanes, then levels would be chosen from [1, 2] water lanes 30% of the time. This is done for 6 trials/random seeds with a limit of 10M frames. We do find that this mitigates catastrophic forgetting, as training divergence did not happen in any of the trials. However, the agent makes less progress towards the curriculum than in Section 5.4 with the auxiliary reward. In Section 5.4, all six trials got to at least 4 water lanes, whereas in this baseline, only one trial got to 4 water lanes. The average number of water lanes across all trials was 2.958. Additionally, in this baseline, none of the trials were able to solve the goal level (unlike in Section 5.4, where 5 of the trials could solve the goal level). We find that, although stochastically selecting previously solved levels prevents catastrophic forgetting, it may not be an optimal approach for advancing the curriculum. We hypothesize that this occurs because 30% of the training budget is being spent to prevent agent forgetting, rather than learning how to solve the latest level in the curriculum. Therefore, it would be valuable to have an agent learn and utilize the auxiliary reward used in Section 5.4, as this both prevents catastrophic forgetting and advances the curriculum.\n\nThird, we conducted a baseline that was similar to the second one, except instead of sampling previously solved levels, all possible levels (from 1 to 5 water lanes) were sampled. Six trials/random seeds were used with a limit of 10M frames. This baseline generally does poorly. In 4 trials, the training divergence still occurred. In only one trial was the training still active; this trial reached 3.0 water lanes. We hypothesize that this baseline performs worse than sampling previously solved levels, because sampling more difficult levels generally leads to more difficult levels that may not be solvable. This yields sparser returns and induces the same training divergence behavior seen in Section 5.3.\n\nWe hope this has addressed the reviewer\u2019s concern, we would be happy to discuss/ conduct any additional experiments if the reviewer has additional experiments/ concerns in mind."

Indeed, the concept of task progress is not novel to our work. However, we note a difference between our setting and Bruce 2023 is that Bruce 2023 requires expert trajectories to learn their progress model. In our case, we do not have access to expert trajectories, so we can envision that our approach could introduce novelty by relaxing this assumption and thereby extend their method."

                    "value": "The paper studies intrinsic learning in children and how they use \u2018level progress\u2019 information to modulate their understanding of goals and make progression towards task goals. This automated curriculum selection in children isn\u2019t random (as shown with experiments) and helps them learn. Authors use the same principle to design RL agents to solve simple game playing tasks with varying levels and design hand-crafted curriculum and conduct experiments to understand how RL agents learn in the absence of extrinsic rewards and whether they are able to recover from failures. The baseline they develop isn\u2019t able to achieve goals as difficulty levels increase. \u201cAlthough for simpler environments it may be possible to recover, as the complexity is smaller and random actions may find the goal, for harder environments with multiple lanes, this divergence is unrecoverable.\u201d From Fig 5b, Before training divergence (which happens with increasing levels of difficulty and catastrophic forgetting), the exact relationship of reward and level progress depends on the task complexity. The easiest task (1 water lane, dark blue) has the greatest slope, since changes in level progress yield relatively greater mean training reward. However, this pattern does not transfer as the complexity increases. With inspiration from how children use the level progress as a proxy for reward signal, authors conduct experiments using the similar level progress information as intrinsic reward signal. RL agents learn much better and can recover from catastrophic forgetting when using this intrinsic progress as a reward signal after every episode. Intrinsic rewards decrease as levels progress however they do not collapse and can increase (recover) in certain circumstances. Authors suggest understanding how to integrate these intrinsic level progression into RL agents from the world states (eg. From high dimensional images) will be crucial towards the path for more general learning agents."

In our experiment setup, we included an extra difficult level beyond the target level to validate that children were not just making random choices: we found that so far only 14% of children selected to play this extra difficult level, suggesting that most children understood what their goal was and did not attempt what was beyond that goal. Furthermore, we observe statistically significant evidence that children use their game level competence to guide their decision of which level to play next, again reflecting that they understood their task and were not making random responses.\nWith regards to multiple choice questions, there are developmental studies studying children of similar age ranges that use multiple choice questions [1],[2]. We will include relevant citations in our paper. More importantly, we found that most children were able to respond correctly to the multiple choice question pertaining to the true causal rule of the game.\n[1] Kominsky, J.
