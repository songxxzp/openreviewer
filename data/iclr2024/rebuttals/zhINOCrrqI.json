Perhaps this weakness is really an issue in the field at large and not the responsibility of this paper.  \n2. The experiments are all visual. It is my understanding that feature attribution methods are often used in practice on tabular problems as well as language. If AttributionLab would benefit from including ways of evaluating XAI tools in those other very popular domains."

In light of this work, knowing that feature attribution methods tend to disagree, what level of faithfulness int he Attribution Lab do the authors ascribe to \"sufficient\" for use in practice? In other words -- we have existing work that shows that two methods won't find the same feature importance scores, so less than 100% faithful must be tolerable -- do the authors have intuition or recommendations for practitioners on faithfulness ranges that are good/bad?\n2. With respect to IG and Occlusion, an interesting point is made on the importance of the baseline value for these methods. I understand how a 'good' choice is made in AttributionLab and how we can conclude that the baseline matters. Is there a method for picking real baselines on real data? On real tabular data? or natural language data?"

                        "value": "We are thankful for the reviewer's positive acknowledgment and constructive insights. Below, we delve into detailed responses to the concerns.\n\n### W1: Definition of faithfulness\nThe reviewer's point about the abstract nature of \"faithfulness\" in feature attribution is indeed thought-provoking. This concept varies in interpretation among different researchers, leading to a spectrum of understandings. As highlighted in our Related Work section, the existing formalizations of faithfulness in the literature come with their own set of issues. A common complication is that these definitions often intertwine with other intricate concepts, such as out-of-distribution (OOD) effects.  In contrast, using our framework, we can materialize the abstract notion of alignment with the model, because we know how the model uses each feature. This approach simplifies the assessment of faithfulness by clearly separating it from other confounding factors, including OOD effects.\n\n### W2: Extension of AttributionLab to other data modalities and tasks\nWe agree that extending to other modalities (language and table) is a natural extension of AttributionLab. However, even in the visual domain itself we had to push many experiments and results to the appendix section. Extension to tabular, graphs and language can be standalone works themselves. The design of AttributionLab can be extended to various data modalities and tasks. The essential requirement for researchers is to manually craft both the model and the data in a manner that ensures the model\u2019s predictive behavior is completely transparent. This fundamental principle remains consistent across different modalities and tasks, indicating no theoretical impediments to extending AttributionLab's application. \n\n\n### Q1: Faithfulness thresholds for a method\nWe appreciate the reviewer for raising this point. It is important to note that our AttributionLab is primarily intended as a sanity check or debugging tool, rather than a benchmarking platform. Consequently, if an attribution method exhibits less than 100% faithfulness in our tests, it implies that the method may have inherent limitations. However, this does not automatically render the attribution method unsuitable for real-world applications. As we show in the paper, we can see how and why the attribution is not faithful to the model. For instance, our observations with DeepSHAP indicate that while it accurately attributes to the contributing features, it fails to distinguish between positively and negatively contributing features effectively.\n\n### Q2: How to choose a proper baseline\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. Indeed, our observations emphasize the significant impact of baseline choice on the effectiveness of attribution methods, particularly when the baseline is known. Our work underscores the crucial link between the choice of baseline and the model's learned distribution. To select an appropriate baseline, one must have prior knowledge of the model's learned distribution, which AttributionLab facilitates due to its designed model and data.\n\nHowever, in many existing studies, the baseline is chosen based solely on the data. Common practices range from using simple black pixels (value 0) to average pixel values. Some approaches have employed more sophisticated techniques, such as inpainting the input when an object is removed, to predict the baseline for the excised portion. But these methods primarily consider only the data. Consider a model trained on CIFAR-10, which is not encoded to recognize a broader range of natural images beyond its 10 classes. If you input an image of a car on a dirt road into both a CLIP model and a CIFAR-trained model, the appropriate baselines would differ. For the CLIP model, using the dirt value as a baseline might be more appropriate, as it's likely been trained on images of both dirt and cars. However, for the CIFAR-trained model, the dirt represents an OOD value. Thus, a proper baseline should be within the distribution that the model has learned, which in itself is a challenging problem.\n\nWithin AttributionLab, we can accurately determine baseline values because we fully understand the model's internal computation process. In real-world scenarios, we can improve the likelihood of choosing the right baselines by considering the specific task at hand. For example, for a model trained on chest X-rays, a good baseline might be the background values of chest X-rays (close to black), as the model is extensively trained on images characterized by stark black-and-white contrast."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and observations. We have carefully considered and responded to each point in the following discussion.\n\n### W1: Central messages of our work\nWe appreciate the reviewer for bringing up this important aspect. We completely agree that merely illustrating the shortcomings of methods may not suffice, despite its insightful nature. In reality, our work is already in harmony with the concerns you highlighted. Unlike previous evaluations that primarily concentrate on benchmarking attribution methods, our approach involves framing the work as a debugging setup. Here, we systematically assess each attribution method independently, uncovering its flaws, and suggesting viable remedies. This distinctive approach underscores our commitment to addressing concerns constructively rather than just highlighting issues.\n\n**Stepping beyond benchmarking towards debugging setup**\nAttributionLab serves as a strong sanity check and debugging tool for testing feature attribution methods. By evaluating their alignment with ground truth attributions, we can test whether a method produces faithful attributions. In such a fully controllable environment, we can uncover the issues with attribution methods. For instance, we reveal in AttributionLab that IG is very sensitive to the baseline value, and IG performs substantially better when it uses the true baseline (for a complete discussion on IG and baseline, please check our response to reviewer MuCE, Q2). Additionally, our findings in AttributionLab have led to improvements in existing methods. For instance, we observed that LIME's performance is heavily dependent on the segmentation method. In our latest experiments, detailed in Figures 21 to 23 in Appendix I, we substantially enhanced LIME's faithfulness by employing a more accurate segmentation technique. Thus, AttributionLab not only aids researchers in uncovering the limitations of attribution methods but also directs them towards effective solutions for these challenges.\n\nWe warmly invite the reviewer to participate further in this discussion. Your insights and suggestions are valuable in enhancing AttributionLab and advancing research in feature attribution.\n\n### Q1: Generalization of the findings and potential improvements for attribution methods\n\nIn our experiments conducted using AttributionLab, we extended our testing to real-world models, such as VGG\u2014a representative CNN architecture\u2014on large-scale datasets like ImageNet. These tests corroborated our initial findings from AttributionLab, demonstrating that the issues identified with attribution methods are indeed prevalent in real-world scenarios.\n\nThe insights gained from AttributionLab have paved the way for enhancements in the attribution methods we tested. For example, our research indicates that DeepSHAP excels at localizing predictive features, albeit without accounting for the attribution sign. In scenarios where the goal is merely to identify features relevant to predictions, one could utilize the absolute values of DeepSHAP attributions. This approach is validated by the high Overall Precision and Overall Recall of DeepSHAP, as depicted in Figure 5(a). Additionally, our findings highlight the significant impact of segmentation methods on LIME attribution results. Leveraging more advanced segmentation techniques, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), could yield more semantic-aware segmentation masks for the subsequent LIME attribution. We observe that the attribution is faithful in terms of attribution sign as well. We have conducted additional experiments utilizing SAM in both AttributionLab and real-world environments. As detailed in Appendix I (Figure 21, Figure 22, and Figure 23), the LIME attribution maps generated with SAM demonstrate markedly improved faithfulness.  This enhancement is evident both in real-world scenarios and AttributionLab. Furthermore, this improvement of LIME attribution maps in real-world scenarios is consistent across both CNN and vision transformer (ViT) architectures. The LIME-SAM method seems to faithfully represent the contribution of different segments of the scene in terms of the scale of contribution and the sign of the contribution (positive/negative)."

                    "value": "The paper proposes a new simulated environment for attribution faithfulness measurement. Attribution faithfulness refers to checking how well the attribution maps from different attribution methods such as Lime or integrated gradients align with the ground truth attribution map. This faithfulness can guide us to select which attribution method to rely more on. Existing methods of attribution faithfulness design a synthetic dataset in which the expected attribution maps are known and then after the network's training on this dataset, they check how well aligned are the predicted attribution maps with the ground truth attribution map. The authors argue that there is a fundamental flaw with this, because the neural network might not be actually using the ground truth attributions to perform the task. For instance, there might be some spurious features in the dataset which can lead to 100% train accuracy, and thus any attribution method that generates these spurious features in the predicted attribution map will be scored lower in faithfulness as the the predicted attribution (even though correct) will be different than ground truth attribution map. \n\nThus the authors argue that instead of just designing the dataset, any controlled environment should also design the neural network so that we exactly know which features are actually being used by the model. The authors design a dataset where the aim is to predict the dominant colour (in terms of number of pixels) and design the neural network in a way that it first detects the colour and then counts the number of pixels for that colours. The authors then use different attribution methods to predict the attribution maps for different images and then measure their faithfulness."

Below, we delve into detailed responses to the raised concerns.\n\n### W1 & Q1: Extension to other tasks\nWe sincerely thank the reviewer for acknowledging the contributions of our research. As detailed in Appendix D and Appendix E, we have an additional synthetic setting, termed single-color-modulo. This setting diverges from the multi-color-sum scenario by focusing on a regression task, rather than classification. We have made similar observations in the single-color-modulo setting as in the multi-color-sum setting and ImageNet. Moreover, the potential of our synthetic setting to be adapted for more complex models and tasks opens avenues for exploring feature attribution in greater depth. Throughout our paper, we present qualitative experiments demonstrating that our observations are also applicable to real-world scenarios, such as ImageNet-VGG. During the discussion phase, we introduced an enhanced variation of the existing LIME method, as depicted in Figures 21 to 23 in Appendix I. We also qualitatively demonstrate that this improvement effectively transfers to Vision Transformers (ViTs). We kindly invite the reviewer to engage further in this discussion, especially considering the promising potential of our work."

The goal of the proposed framework is to test the faithfulness of the attribution methods that represents the similarity between attributed features and the true features used by model for prediction. Since the trained model could rely on unwanted or spurious feature for its prediction in order to effectively evaluate the attribution method, there is a need to have models that relies on known and reliable features. The proposed synthetic framework achieves this by defining custom tasks (for e.g dominant shape\u2019s color prediction) - as the ground truth attribution is known as well as by manually setting the weights of models (CNN based classifier) that are the true solution for the given custom tasks. The paper hypothesizes that if the attribution methods output doesn\u2019t align with the known GT attribution of the task then the attribution would be unreliable. The paper empirically evaluates different attribution methods and also proposes some improvement for those attribution methods."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's insightful feedback and take this opportunity to thoroughly address the concerns in the subsequent sections.\n\n### W1: Support for transformers\n**Attribution is still not solved for CNNs and MLPs** The focus of the literature has primarily been on addressing the attribution problem within CNNs and MLPs, a challenge that continues to be unresolved. Furthermore, MLPs and CNNs are still widely used in recent large-scale models. For instance, MLPs are used for encoding Key, Query, and Value in transformers, while CNNs are used interspersed with attention in the UNet in Stable Diffusion. Therefore, feature attribution for CNNs and MLPs is still a very critical research topic. In our work, we are pleased to present a significant advancement towards a solution, utilizing a fully controllable environment for the first time. This novel approach not only serves as a strong sanity check and debugging tool for various methods but also exposes the unique properties and limitations of all existing methods we have tested. \n\n**It is feasible to extend the framework to Transformers** We showcased several CNN and MLP modules designed for various tasks. The versatility of our method extends to other setups such as regression and multimodal tasks. This extendibility is a key strength of our approach. For future work we can propose transformers for the proposed tasks, as there is nothing fundamentally different (in fact MLPs are part of the equation). While exploring the application of existing attribution methods to transformers remains an intriguing prospect, our current focus on CNNs and MLPs has enabled us to identify specific issues and properties of these models. As most of these attribution methods themselves can be also applied to transformers. For instance in a new experiment (shown in Figure 21, 22, 23 in Appendix I), we show that an extension of LIME which was found to work well in AttributionLab, seems promising in ViT as well.\n\n### W2:  Attention in transformers implicitly represents attribution\n\n**Attention being explanation is disputed** Attention maps offer insights into the interactions between input tokens in transformers. However, their effectiveness as reliable explanations has been a topic of considerable debate. These attention maps visualize attribution between Query (Q) and Key (K). However, Q and K are outcomes of encoding through two MLPs in the attention layer, which means that attention maps offer only a partial view of the entire attention process, as the mappings to Q and K remain unknown. Additionally, the complexity introduced by multiple layers and attention heads further complicates the interpretation of this information. Besides, previous studies also question the validity of attention maps being explanations. Jain et al. [1] and Serrano et al. [2] have highlighted inconsistencies between attention maps and gradient-based or occlusion-based methods. Furthermore, Attanasio et al. [3] reveal in a benchmark that attention maps are only partially faithful for transformers. These studies collectively suggest that attention maps may not fully capture the nuances of contributions of Q and K. In light of these insights, we primarily focus on studying the post-hoc attribution methods in this work.\n\n**Attribution is still needed for transformers** Feature attribution methods explain models from different aspects. One of the mainly accepted ones in the concept of contribution (credit assignment). This concept assigns contribution to features based on their effect on the output when they are removed from the input. Most attribution methods are based on this aspect. This aspect is orthogonal to attention and activation values. Thus even if attention values were understood properly, they would still shed light on one facet of transformers and the contribution assignment methods still reveal different insights.\n\n[1] Jain, S., & Wallace, B.C.

                        "value": "### W3: Extension to other tasks\n**Other tasks already exist**\nIn our study, we have expanded our synthetic setting to include a regression task called single-color-modulo, as detailed in Appendix D and E. Adhering to the core principles of AttributionLab, we manually crafted both the MLP-based neural network and the corresponding dataset. \n\n**Propositions and axioms of feature attribution** We intentionally enforced the symmetry and sensitivity propositions in both the data and model design. These properties stem from the sensitivity and symmetry axioms [4] of feature attribution. Incorporating them into the designs gives us the ability to see if different attribution methods are aligned in practice with these axioms. These axioms outline desired properties for attribution methods. However, it does not mean we need to be bound by these properties. Depending on the properties of the attribution method we aim to evaluate, we can adapt our setups to include more, fewer, or different axioms.\n\n**Symmetry, Sensitivity are not limits, but additions** These properties facilitate the evaluation of corresponding properties in attribution methods, as previously discussed. Creating setups that lack these properties is relatively straightforward. For example, consider a simplified color classifier setup that determines the presence of a color. Imagine an input with two blue shapes and one yellow shape. In this scenario, the setup lacks sensitivity, as the classification can be triggered by just one colored pixel, and it's not inherently clear which specific pixel leads to the classification. The absence of these properties restricts our evaluation capabilities. Therefore, incorporating properties like sensitivity and symmetry adds complexity to the setup but significantly enhances its evaluative potential, a benefit that extends to more abstract and complex tasks. Hence, including the sensitivity or symmetry axiom is not a limitation or drawback. Rather, it's an addition to evaluate these properties within attribution methods.\n\n\n[4] \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bSundararajan, M., & Najmi, A. (2020, November).

PMLR.\n\n### W4: Generalization to larger scales\n\n*Minor remark*: We have several CNN and MLP modules, and the color detector alone is 4 layer CNN (The models are ~ 10 layers). The tasks range from modulo computation to counting and color detection.\n\nWe agree that the absence of a formal proof for generalization, as you highlighted, represents a limitation within the ground truth-based approach, as also acknowledged in our paper. Despite this, the research on interpretability and the feature attribution problem at a large scale remains inconclusive and open. We encounter the disagreement problem [5] where although the methods are theoretically sound, they diverge in their outcomes. Our paper contends that the exploration of a controlled setup in this research direction is opening new opportunities to address this issue. Please consider the following:\n\n- **Sanity check and debugging** The framework functions as a sanity check and provides an environment for debugging methods. While it may not offer the ultimate solution within this paradigm, it allows us to identify what doesn't work. This is akin to the strategy employed in the sanity checks [6] paper, which critically evaluated various attribution methods prevalent in prior research. In addition, our framework enables us to understand how certain approaches fail and suggests potential solutions to address the issues.\n\n- **Toy models are also used for understanding large models (e.g. LLMs)** With the current explosion in scale, the problem gets more and more convoluted to interpret these large foundation models. In order to understand them, the recent mechanistic interpretability works [7] also use toy transformers to understand their behavior. \n\n- **No method works at current small scale** Despite the simplicity of the tasks, none of the attributions produces perfect attributions. In an ideal scenario, an attribution should perform flawlessly in AttributionLab (or any controlled environment).\n\n\n[5] Krishna, S., Han, T., Gu, A., Pombra, J., Jabbari, S., Wu, S., & Lakkaraju, H.
