When the RL agent wants to explore some unseen states, the trained model will penal this exploration since unlike the real world, the trained transition model does not really know how the unseen state will transit to another state, so we need to add the uncertainty as the penalty to prevent the agent from explore the unseen state unlimitedly. But if we overestimate the uncertainty, the penalty to the agent\u2019s exploration will be too heavy and the agent will be too pessimistic[1].\n\nHope these can solve your problems.\n\n[1] Why so pessimistic? Estimating uncertainties for offline rl through ensembles, and why their independence matters"

The method uses information corresponding to 12 possible movements at the intersection, and it is not clear whether this is information that can be obtained in a real environment.\n\n3. The paper heavily leans on the MOPO framework, both in terms of its structural framework and its theoretical underpinnings. A more comprehensive rationale for the selection of MOPO over other comparable alternatives is necessary.\n\n4. The main method of the paper does not show a clear increase in performance compared to MOPO.  Also, the paper limits experimental evaluation to a single kind of offline dataset. This limited scope limits the generalizability of the results. Extending your assessment to include multiple datasets is critical to demonstrating real-world scalability."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful feedback.\n\nQ1: Since the \u201cMovement Independent Transition\u201d aims for the TSC problem according to its semantics and mathematical assumptions, it can be only applied to other model-based Offline TSC RL algorithms, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no other Offline RL algorithms aiming to TSC problem appeared in peer-reviewed conferences or journals. But if there are such a kind of algorithms in the future, we can apply them effectively since we first separate the intersection features into the granularity of lanes and do the training normally. Finally, we concatenate the output of the model from lane granularity to intersection granularity for RL agents making decisions.\n\nQ2: There are 12 lanes in one intersection (there are four directions, each direction has three lanes for left turn, straight, and right turn) so we can extract 12 movement information from one intersection. Since this is one of our main contributions, we didn\u2019t apply it to other algorithms, but it can be conveniently added to other algorithms as Q1 described, making them perform better.\n\nQ3: The most common and simplest policy in the real world is fixed time policy. To make our method practical in the real world, we chose it as our sample policy collecting offline dataset. But since nowadays some traffic lights have deployed some better policies, e.g. max pressure policy, we can collect other offline datasets with these better policies in the future.\n\nHope these can solve your problems."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful feedback.\n\nQ1: \u201cConcat\u201d operation is an engineering problem. Since we proposed the concept of \u201cMovement Independent Transition\u201d, we separate the data in one intersection into 12 parts, each standing for a lane to decrease the error in uncertainty estimation while improving the offline data utilization. But for the RL agents, they need the whole intersection features vector as the input, thus we need to \u201cConcat\u201d the output of our model into the input of RL agents.\n\nQ2: We followed the assumption in the former work MOPO[1]. In our work, we use the transition model to mimic the real-world traffic flow, which helps the RL agents make better decisions. Since in the real world, the intersection features like queue length and pressure cannot change unlimitedly from time to time, that is why we assume the transition model, i.e. the Bayesian neural networks are K-Lipschitz.\n\nQ3: The real-world dataset are traffic flow dataset, which presents a vehicle\u2019s trajectory from origin to destination, but how the vehicle interacts with other vehicles, with the environment, and with the traffic light is left to be unknown, we need both real-world dataset and simulator to fully simulate a vehicle\u2019s behavior. Our policy is trained under the real-world traffic flow dataset combined with the simulator which deployed the simplest TSC policy: Fixed time policy. Using these data we have our offline RL agents trained. We evaluate also with real-world traffic flow dataset combined with the simulator but with our trained TSC policy. We can see the improvement compared to the sample policy: Fixed time policy.\n\nHope these can solve your problems.\n\n[1] MOPO: Model-based Offline Policy Optimization, page 5"

The literature review is quite poor. The authors should better point out their novelty in the context of existing offline and online Deep RL-based TSC problems.\n2. The techniques should be expanded to multiple TSCs.\n3. Many commercial simulators are nowadays available that reliably mimic the traffic evolution of a network of TSCs, aiding the design of online algorithms."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insightful feedback.\n\nQ1: This work has two main novelties. First, we study and formulate the problem of TSC under the offline RL setting. Although TSC is an old problem and has many novel methods, it still has a long distance to be implemented in the real world, and one of the main reasons is its unstable performance at the very early stage of online RL training, and what this work wants to do is to some extent make up for this problem. We adapt offline RL methods to TSC problem, using offline dataset train the agent, getting it prepared to be implemented in the real world. Second, we proposed the concept \u201cMovement Independent Transition\u201d and proved its effectiveness mathematically and experimentally in improving the model\u2019s accuracy in estimating the uncertainty, which results in better prediction performance.\n\nQ2: Actually our method aims to multiple TSCs. All of the experiments shown in Table 1 are conducted under multiple TSCs settings. And the New York setting can even support intersections for up to 192.\n\nQ3: Making the simulators mimic the traffic flow more reliably and adapting offline methods  are two orthogonal approaches to the same problem, making the TSC agents more reliable when implementing it to the real world. However, both of these methods suffer from the problem of performance discount caused by distribution shift. This is because simulators cannot perfectly replicate real-world conditions, and offline datasets may not capture all the situations that can arise in the real world.\nTo overcome the limitations of simulators, they need to be fine-tuned based on real-world data to accurately model vehicle flow and driving behavior. Unfortunately, none of the traffic signal control simulators currently available support fine-tuning of vehicle flow or calibration of driving behavior through the calibration API.\nTo address the issues with offline RL, we can apply the uncertainty to the training process to improve the model\u2019s generalizability. Both of these approaches hold significant potential, not just in traffic signal control but also in various fields that leverage RL.\nAnd our proposed methods followed the works in offline RL and adapted transportation theory to it to make is perform better under traffic signal control problem.\n\nHope these can solve your questions."
