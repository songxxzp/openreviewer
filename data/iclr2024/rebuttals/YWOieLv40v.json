Focusing on geometric domains such as ones induced by some underlying physical model is an interesting motivation as such data is highly structured and it may be easier to find meaningful trends when considering interactions within the domain. The way in which the interactions are measured is interesting -- although, from my understanding, not novel."

To me, it is also not immediately clear what the contributions of the paper are. There are also typos, broken reference links, and strange/uncommon usage of words in the work although this critique might be considered more cosmetic. \n\n(W2) Proposition 1 to me seems trivial and true by definition of a global/local minimum. \n\n(W3) The figures are very small and hard to read."

My understanding is tha $J$ is computed through a model $f$, which would not be available for the \"data\" distribution? \n\nIn your rewiring algorithm -- do you only consider building k-NN graphs? The point is then that you are proposing a way to choose $k$ based on the measure $J$. Am I understanding correctly?"

The paper discovers that different inductive biases will cause different sensitivity of interaction strength orders.

The experiments demonstrate the discovered inductive biases/interaction strength alignment, the performance of the proposed adjustment, and the inductive bias comparisons between GNNs and DNNs."

The authors discovered that the interaction strength mismatching is one of the important reasons GNNs can be trapped in a local minimum.\n3. The paper also introduces how different inductive biases: KNN-graphs (with EGNN) and FC-graphs (with Malformed) affect the interaction strength.\n4. According to experimental observations, the authors propose an effective algorithm to adjust inductive bias using KNN-graphs to achieve better results.\n5. Authors further discuss inductive bias in DNNs.\n6. The presentation of the paper is generally good."

I hope to see more justifications in terms of the new metric introduced for node-level multi-order interaction.\n2. The paper has the potential to be a great empirical study. However, the experiments to show the representation bottleneck are too limited.\n3. The proposed method is not well-motivated. Although the authors claim that the method is motivated by a tendency during the experiments, I still think the method is not well-motivated. For example, why do the authors adopt rewiring? Why did the authors choose KNN? And how and why is the threshold $\\bar{J}$ determined?\n4. The soundness of the method is also a concern. I did not see any theoretical insights provided to justify why the method works.\n5. The performance improvement in regards to Molformer is limited."

                    "value": "1. I'm confused why for two inductive biases KNN-graphs and FC-graphs, only one method for each was compared. I would like to see more methods for each of KNN-graphs and FC-graphs in Figure 1 to see the significance of the phenomenon.\n2. In terms of graph structure learning, how do those methods affect the interaction strength?\n3. The authors mentioned the proposed method can achieve stronger interpretability and generalization, but I failed to find the corresponding evidence. In terms of generalization ability, the authors may need to compare those methods with generalization design and dive into how their designs affect the interaction strength.\n\nOverall, I feel the paper has an interesting core but the authors choose to cover it superficially from many aspects instead of digging into one of them. This makes the claims in this paper not strong and clear enough."

The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on real-world and synthetic datasets. The paper also provides supplementary materials on the multi-order interaction tool and proves the equivalence of the reformed multi-order interaction to the original definition.
