The authors propose using variational inference to efficiently estimate the causal effect with better approximation. The proposed approach considers the confounder as an observed variable. It also includes the optimization of three distributional components named encoder, decoder, and prior that are trained separately using observational data. Finally, the encoder is fine-tuned to get a better estimate of the causal effect/interventional distribution."

These methods are suitable for training on high-dimensional data and can sample from interventional distributions.\n\n[Section 3.2]\n* The authors mentioned, \u201csampled high dimensional Z will almost never give high probability to p(y | x, z) for a chosen Y and X.\u201d I would request the authors to explain how this leads to a high variance issue.\n* It should be more explicitly mentioned that the authors are using a causal sufficient system i.e., all variables [X, Z, Y] are observed.\n\n[Section 3.3]\n* The authors mentioned, \u201cthe joint training in equation 10 is not guaranteed to converge\u201d. The authors should explain the reasons behind this in more detail. \n\n[Section 4.2]\n* Figure 4 a,b, and c should be explained in more detail. It is a little unclear what figures 4 a, and b imply.\n* The image qualities of the MNIST and X-ray experiment might be improved by using better neural architectures. If the motivation of this paper includes applying causality in vision with high dimensional images, the proposed method should produce the same quality images as the papers that claim to do intervention without utilizing causal approaches.\n\nMajor concerns:\n* The authors utilize the backdoor adjustment to estimate the P(Y|do(X)) interventional likelihood. They propose their method for causal graphs that satisfy the backdoor criterion and consider all variables are high dimensional. To my knowledge there exist different neural causal model-based approaches that solve more generic version of this problem. \u2028For example, for a causal sufficient system, i.e., when all variables are observed (same as the authors\u2019 assumption), [1,2] can sample from P(Y|do(X)) for any causal graph. This includes the backdoor graph discussed in this paper as well. For example: The MNIST experiment results should be able to be reproduced with [1,2]. Moreover, [3] relaxes the causal sufficient assumption and can sample from any identifiable P(Y|do(X)) even if there exist unobserved variables in the causal graph. For example, in the front door causal graph: X->Z->Y, X<-U->Y, U is unobserved. [3] can sample from P(Y|do(X)) even if all X, Z, and Y are high-dimensional. These existing works make the novelty of this paper questionable. I would request the authors to distinguish the novelty of this paper compared to the mentioned works.\n\n\n\n[1] Murat Kocaoglu, et al.

We will include a more thorough discussion of neural SCMs.\n\n[Section 3.2]\n\nMonte Carlo with an uninformative prior is not useful because it will require an extremely large number of samples. For a fixed sample size, sampling from the posterior will result in an estimate with reduced variance.\n\nAlthough we several times state that the variables are observed, we also will include the terminology \u201ccausal sufficient system\u201d\n\n[Section 3.3]\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows: under joint training, the parameters of $p(y|x,z)$ and $p(z)$ are set to maximize the lower bound in Equation 4 and are no longer bound to the data distribution. In this setting, there exists a trivial parameterization that estimates $\\log p(y|x)$. It is possible for $\\log p(y|x) > \\log p(y|do(x))$, so then it is possible to converge to the wrong solution.\n\n[Section 4.2]\n\nThe main result from the MNIST experiment is Figure 4c. By construction, the MNIST observational data will only have X and Z that are consecutive in number, e.g. ([1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], etc), and consequently Y will be composed as such. Figure 4c shows that if we model the observational distribution p(y|x), these consecutive numbers will be more likely, whereas when modeling the interventional distribution $p(y|do(x))$ this is not the case.\n\nMajor Concerns:\n\nWe acknowledge that works [1, 2, 3] are more general in that they apply to different DAGs. However, we maintain that VBA is different because rather than focus on sampling, we can evaluate interventional likelihood. [1] does not explicitly model the likelihood since it is GAN based. [2] estimates likelihood of each of the components, and allows for sampling from counterfactual SCMs, but it does not model interventional likelihood explicitly. Similarly, [3] is the most general and can estimate $p(y|do(x))$, but it does so by sampling. In our work, we have included sampling as a baseline, but going forward will be more explicit with comparing with existing neural SCMs.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* In theory, we can generalize our variational inference to the front door graph, but that is beyond the focus of our work. By \u201cmore complex graphs\u201d, we mean that the graph can be more complex but Z must be a sufficient adjustment set.\n* In Objective 9, we have parameters $\\phi,\\theta,\\gamma$. These parameters can represent their own gradient-based architecture that can be trained with backpropagation.\n* To clarify, joint training can converge to the wrong distribution. If out encoder $q(z|x,y)$ is expressive enough, we can show that the fine tuning objective will converge to $p(y|do(x))$ in the limit of infinite data.\n* As previously argued for joint training, $p(y|x,z)$ can be parameterized as $p(y|x)$ leading to an inconsistent estimate\n* As shown in the linear Gaussian setting, finetuning will lead to a better estimate of $p(y|do(x))$\n* Binary MNIST is MNIST with pixels taking on values 0 or 1"

                    "value": "There are weaknesses in both the theoretical contributions as well as the experimental setup.\n\n## Weaknesses in the theoretical results.\n\n### Re ELBO in Eq. 4:\n\nThe main concern with the lower bound in Eq. 4 is when equality will hold, i.e., under what conditions is the ELBO equal to the interventional distribution in Eq. 2? In the subsequent paragraph, the authors say that \"penalty incurred by encoder will be its KL divergence with ... $p(z)$\". \nThe is incorrect: the (Jensen) gap between Eq. 2 and Eq. 4 is *not* equal to KL(q(.|x, y) || p(z)). Did the authors mean something else when they use the word \"penalty\" here?\n\nThe gap is different from the standard variational Bayes formulation (where z is latent) where it is KL between q(z) and p(z|X). In this backdoor case, as the authors say, since $Z$ is observed, the evidence (or Eq. 2) itself depends on Z. So it is not clear to me what $q$ would have to be if equality holds in Eq. 4. Can equality ever hold to begin with?\n\nAs a related point, is the estimator obtained by solving Eq. 9 even consistent? Assuming that you had access to infinite data and assuming you could optimize the objective perfectly, will the estimator converge to the true interventional distribution (this should only be possible if the equality can hold in Eq. 4)?\n\n\n### Re Proposition 1:\nProp. 1 is trying to say how jointly optimizing the objective fails. In the proof, the authors use the fact that if $E[p(y|x)] > E[p(y|do(x))]$, the model converges to p(y|x). I do not understand what $E[p(y|x)] > E[p(y|do(x))]$ has to do with the model converging to $p(y|x)$. The model should converge to whatever maximizes the ELBO (which may or may not be p(y|x)). So even if $E[p(y|x)] > E[p(y|do(x))]$, isn't it possible that the maximum of the objective is obtained somewhere else?\n\n\n### How do you estimate the ATE?:\n\nIn causal inference, we usually care about estimating the ATE or conditional ATE (CATE) using the backdoor adjustment. How exactly do you estimate E[Y|do(x)] from the ELBO in Eq. 4? I can see how, for a given value of $x, y$, you can compute the ELBO in Eq. 4, but how do you compute the expectation E[Y|do(x)]?\n\n\n### Re motivation:\n\nThe authors motivate this work by saying that in case of high-dimensional Z and X, directly sampling Z's leads to high-variance. However, for maximizing the ELBO, the authors need to train models of p(z) and p(z|x, y), both of which are difficult tasks in high-dimensional settings. \nOne drawback is that difficulties in estimating p(z) for high-dimensional Z will itself lead to difficulties in optimizing the ELBO (and the errors should propagate)? This seems to not fix the issue of high-dimensional confounders. Can the authors comment on this?\n\nBy contrast, the standard doubly-robust AIPW estimators require modeling E[Y|z, x] and P(X|Z). In case of high-dimensional $Z$ and low-dimensional $X$ (e.g., binary treatments), why would the variational approach be better? It is not even clear (and neither do the experiments provide evidence for this) that the variational approach suggested by the authors works better than just estimating the ATE using \\hat{E}[Y|z, x], i.e., just training a model to predict Y from (x, z). \n \n## Weaknesses in the experimental results.\n\n\nThe main concern with the experimental results in the lack of any baselines. The approaches should at least be compared to IPW, AIPW, and standard regression estimators (like modeling E[Y|x, z] using a ML predictor).\n\nThe applies to the MNIST and chest X-ray experiments as well. For the MNIST, if you directly trained a model to predict the concatened output image Y from (z, x), does the variational model do better than that? Without such baselines, it is difficult to understand how well your proposed model is doing.\n\nMoreover, other works, e.g., Shi et. al., have also used neural networks for estimating interventional distributions in the backdoor case. The authors should also compare to that."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer wak4,\n\nWe appreciate your feedback and have found it very constructive.\n\nRegarding the Jensen gap, and what value $q(z|x,y)$ must take on to achieve equality in the ELBO, when $q(z|x,y) = p(z| do(x), y)$ the lower bound is tight. We will include this result in the paper and attach a short proof in the appendix. Given that the separate training phase yields a consistent estimate of $p(z)$ and $p(y|x,z)$, we will have consistency assuming $q(z|x,y)$ is parameterized by a family of distributions that includes $p(z|do(x),y)$. This is not notably different from the assumption made in VAEs, that $q(z|x)$ and parameterize the true posterior $p(z|x)$.\n\nFor the proof that joint optimization is inconsistent, you correctly say that it will not necessarily converge to $\\log p(y|x)$. However, the point of the proof is to show the existence of a situation in which it is possible. Thus, by finding such a counterexample, we show that joint optimization is inconsistent.\n\nAs for the motivation, you are correct that if you cannot model $p(z)$ and $p(y|x,z)$ well, then VBA will not yield a good estimate. We also acknowledge that our approach was not intended to be used in the typical treatment effect setting in which X is binary and Z is typically a sparse feature vector in which $p(z)$ is difficult to model. We intended VBA to apply in situations for example where Z is an image. In practice, due to the interdependence of pixels, deep generative models are effective in estimating likelihood estimates of images.\n\nOn a similar note, ATE is a concept from binary treatment effect estimation. In our method, it would be estimated with $p(Y=1 | do(X=1) - p(Y=1 | do(X=0)$. However, we do not claim that VBA is designed for binary treatment effect estimation, in which there are many approaches as you mention. The concept of ATE is not particularly well defined or useful for high dimensional X, Y, Z.\n\nAlthough we understand the concern about lack of baselines, it is difficult to find other methods that are applicable to the same problem: estimate $p(y|do(x))$ for high dimensional X, Y, Z. To the best of our knowledge, methods such as \u201cIPW, AIPW, and standard regression estimators\u201d are not applicable to our setting, but we are open to suggestions."

                        "value": "I thank the authors for their response. I think the experimental baselines are still poor. For this reason, I would not recommend acceptance at this time.\n\nRe tightness of the ELBO:\nThanks. Just looking at the bound, it is still not obvious why q(z|do(x), y) makes equality hold. Please include a proof in the next iteration of the paper. I agree with you that, in this sense, the ELBO is similar to a traditional VAE.\n\n\nRe \"our approach was not intended to be used in the typical treatment effect setting in which X is binary ... for example where Z is an image\":\nI don't quite understand this argument. I think the authors should test their approach even in settings where Z is high-dimension (like an image) and X is binary. In this case, many existing approaches are applicable. For the standard AIPW estimator, you can train models for P(X|Z) and E[Y|X, Z] and just plug them in the AIPW estimator to get the ATE. For high-dimensional Z, you can use ML estimators. This would still make for a good baseline to at least get a sense of how the variational approach does relative to existing methods. If it is not competitive in the binary X case, it might also be less likely to scale to high-dimensional treatments.\n\nRe high-dimensional treatment:\nEven in this case, why can't you train an ML model for the regression E[Y|Z, X] since Z is a sufficient backdoor adjustment set. Then, in your image experiments, you could intervene and just feed the new image X as input. For example, in Fig. 3, why can't you train a generative model to learn Y from X, Z? It seems like with enough data, this model of P(Y|Z, X) should also work."

The paper introduces \"Variational Backdoor Adjustment (VBA),\" a framework consists of three distributional components: encoder, decoder, and prior. While the terminology may resemble that of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), the underlying assumptions are different. These components are optimized separately to ensure correct backdoor adjustment over the observed distributions. The paper provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of VBA in computing backdoor adjustments. It uses synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, including high-dimensional linear Gaussian data and image datasets, demonstrating improved interventional density estimation through their optimization technique."
