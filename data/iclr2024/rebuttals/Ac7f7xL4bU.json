Subsequently, they provide a theoretical proof of the algorithm's effectiveness for point sets located near the union of k subspaces.\n\nIn order to validate their algorithm, the authors conduct experiments that compare its performance not only on the general KSC problem but also on the aforementioned specific cases."

A more general modeling approach involves replacing subspaces with flats, commonly known as projective clustering. In projective clustering, the inherent cluster does not necessarily need to contain the origin point. Additionally, It appears to me that small $||Z||$ is impossible when m and n are large.\n- SVD is time-consuming. In the experiments, both m and n are very small. However, as m and n increase, the limitation imposed by the time complexity of SVD becomes more apparent. In the context of special cases, numerous efficient algorithms (e.g., fast PCA) have been developed while this paper is short of such content. In my opinion, if this work aims to propose practical algorithms, it should include a detailed or outlined strategy for acceleration.\n- The lack of discussions regarding the norm of $Z$ (see questions below)"

However, there is no explicit discussion about this aspect in the paper.\n    - $Z$ is thought as the noise, hence it is natural to assume that it follows some certain distribution. What about the implications of this assumption on the value of $\\||Z\\||$?\n    - What is the rate of increase of $\\||Z\\||$ when n and m increase? As for the assumption in theorem 1, how do values of n and m affect its feasibility, will larger n or m make it harder to hold?\n- Does the computation time reported in the experiment include the decision time for determining hyperparameter $\\lambda$?\n- The main body of the paper lacks an optimization point of view of the problem. That is, the goal is to minimize $\\ell := \\||X - UV^T\\||$ and define $OPT$ ($\\||Z\\||$) as the minimal value of $\\ell$. Since $OPT$  is unknown beforehand, can you explain what the output of the closed-form solution would be if $OPT$  is not small enough to meet the assumption in theorem 1?"

However, this paper did not give detailed analysis of time complexity and memory usage of the proposed method.

                    "value": "**Novelty and contribution**\n\nMy first concern is on the lack of novelty and the contribution is unclear, because of the following reasons:\n1. The derivation of the unified expression i.e. Eq. (2) in the paper for the three problems (PCA, ONMF, and K-means) seems to be a good idea, but essentially they are different realizations of the low-rank approximation in a form of SVD, so the novelty here is very limited (no criticism on the methodology but just want to say the proposal of this unified expression may not be novel by itself). Also, the equivalence of these three problems has already been observed for a long while, as pointed out by the authors as well in the related work section.\n2. The proposed closed-form solution essentially consists of two steps: an SVD step + a refinement step. Again, the novelty here is limited, since using SVD for recovering the low-rank component from its noise-perturbed observation is an extremely common technique, especially it is the standard approach for PCA. Even if the refinement step could be something new (I am not sure but if this is true, would be good to point out in the paper), this part has not been fully evaluated as the algorithm (CF+SpC) tested in the experimental section does not included this step. As a result, it is unclear to me what should be the main novelty of this algorithm.\n3. The theoretical analysis is a plus, while its novelty is also limited. Since such an spectral analysis on the low-rank matrix with noise perturbation by using Davis-Kahan theorem is standard, see e.g. Theorem 7 of [1]. So it is good to have a performance guarantee but the analysis itself may not be novel. \n4. As a side note, the novelty and contribution on the theoretical analysis could be increased by conducting a more sharp analysis on the condition of $\\delta$  (possibly by using $l_\\infty$-norm as pointed out by the authors as well), and empirically demonstrated the sharpness (something like Figure 1 in the paper)\n\nGiven the above, I hope the author could clarify the main contributions in the revised manuscript. \n\n\n\n**Experiments**\n\nMy second concern is on the experiments: the proposed method (CF+SpC) tested in experiments basically performs SVD and then apply spectral clustering on the top singular vectors. As a result, I would expect such a method works well since the top singular vectors exhibits a higher SNR than the original data embedding i.e. $x_i$. However, other approaches used for comparison do not apply on the singular vectors as embedding and thus they would definitely performs worse than CF+SpC. Therefore, I would argue that this is an unfair comparison, especially given that the authors claimed CF+SpC achieves SOTA. Here, since the goal is to demonstrate that exact recovery is still possible even if $\\hat{P}_\\lambda$ fails to directly recover the clusters, it is reasonable to just apply those different clustering approaches on the rows of $\\hat{P}$ and see if most of them still achieve exact recovery in this case.\n\nAlso, similar to my second argument in the first section, since the refinement step is not included in the experiments when testing on real datasets, I am interested in the performance of the vanilla closed form algorithm with the refinement step but discard the spectral clustering part. Especially, I would like to see when can we find a disjoint support of $\\hat{P}_\\lambda$, and even if a disjoint support does not exist, would that be possible to find a subset in which a disjoint support can be still achieved, and then partial recovery is still possble? In the current version of this paper, the refinement step is proposed as an important pillar of the algorithm, while it has not been fully tested and empirically evaluated yet, which prevent us from applying it in real scenarios. \n\n**Minor comments**\n\n- It might be worthy to have a summarization on the closed-form algorithm, or an algorithm block. In particular, some important details mentioned in the 'practical considerations' paragraph on page 4 may need to be included, e.g. the tricks for finding a proper choice of $\\lambda$\n- When introducing the two matrices $V$ and $\\bar{V}$, would that be better to just express them as $\\bar{V} = V O$ for some unknown $O$? Then the reason for using $P$ for clustering becomes clear.\n \n[1] Von Luxburg, Ulrike. \"A tutorial on spectral clustering.\" Statistics and computing 17 (2007): 395-416."
