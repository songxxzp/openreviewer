                    "value": "This paper studies how to train NeRF with the optimal training set under limited view inputs for novel view synthesis. It proposes a theoretical framework for view sampling strategies from a causal perspective, finally decomposing the objective into three components: a fitting term similar to traditional NeRF training loss, a consistency term requiring consistency between visible and invisible views, and a uniformity term demanding the sampling to be diverse. The proposed sampling strategy induces higher-quality NeRFs and can be used as regularization term for general NeRF training."

                    "value": "1. The rationale behind the view-sampling task raises questions. In certain scenarios, acquiring additional view images can be challenging. However, when a substantial number of dense views are already available, the motivation to devise a sampling strategy for training the neural rendering model with sparse views appears insufficient. Specifically, the activeNeRF model's primary objective is to identify the most optimal camera view for capturing the training image, rather than selecting from a plethora of pre-existing images.\n2. The paper's primary contribution seems to be the introduction of a metric or loss function to evaluate the selected views. However, the absence of an ablation study that separately assesses the impact of each of these three terms is a missed opportunity for deeper understanding. As a result, the contribution feels somewhat lacking in depth.\n3. The proposed loss function presents challenges in differentiability with respect to 't'. The sampling proposal, derived from the farthest sampling strategy, may not be the most efficient approach. It appears to demand significant training resources, resulting in elevated training costs. The potential enhancements in model performance might not justify the trade-off in terms of the increased training time and resource allocation."

The authors try to solve the problem using a small subset of photos from a total of K potential views, to achieve the best reconstruction. To solve this, the authors propose to use causal represntation learning using loss by Identification Treatment Effect. They propose three terms, a normal fitting term as reconstruction loss, a consistency term to ensure consistency between visible views and invisible views and a uniformity term requires the samples to be distributed evenly. The results show the proposed strategy can provide slightly better reconstruction compared to alternative baselines in the proposed setting."

I may not have understand a lot of details correctly given its current presentation. \n  * It is very hard to read without being very familiar with ActiveNeRF and casual representation learning. Have to trace to original papers for more details. This could be added to the preliminary parts. \n  * Too many notations which makes things more complicated than needed. I don't think I found how exactly the loss of consistency term and uniformity term were calculated in (8) at runtime. As I understand, the method should be as simple as calculating the reconstruction loss using different groups of input samples. Provide an algorithm chart of how of how P^{F}, P^{hat}^{CF} and P^{CF} will greatly help. \n  * There are some notations introduced in 4.1 (e.g. P(Y|do(d))) are not explained until 4.2. \n* Overall I am not sure I understand the real-world impact of this paper using the proposed strategy. Maybe I had some misunderstanding in the details given my concern on its presentation. Please correct me if I am wrong here. The goal of this paper to find \"optimal sampling strategy for training set\", \"K_s corresponding photos as sparse sample inputs among K_d total potential views\" is hardly a real problem statement for its real-world use case, which is my biggest concern for this proposed application of causal representation learning. From sampling perspective, we can use all the K_d potential views as long as they are available. As I understand, the evaluation of the counter factual distribution will require using the non-selected but captured images as supervision, which is not how active learning is executed in real-world case. Given this setting, it makes the results also less appealing in contrast to alternative baselines (which learns to predict next-best unknown view) given the fact all images from that particular datasets are used in evaluating the sampling strategy."

Confirm any places I misunderstood about this paper, as I highlighted in the weakness part. \n2. I am also curious how the views are sampled finally for different groups in the final results. Provide some visualization and discussions about them can be very helpful to guide the view-sampling process in real world applications. I wonder how that indicate the connection of uniformity term and consistency term are correlated to the camera FoV and ray distributions."
