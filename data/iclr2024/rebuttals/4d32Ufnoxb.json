The main contribution of MPT, appears to have a similar idea as GAT, where the attention is limited to edges, but this has not been discussed in detail in the paper, especially on why MPT can apparently outperform GAT in most cases. By the way, there is also an improved version of GAT, called GATv2 [a], might work better than GAT in this regard.\n\n[a] How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks? https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491\n\nW2. The trade-off between local and global information can be further analyzed. For one, the proposed model works seem to be slightly better on graph classification than node classification. Intuitively, global information might be more important to graph classification. The authors author briefly mentioned that global information is more important on heterophily datasets---potentially, deeper analysis can be conducted to investigate the effect of global or local information on different task format (node vs graph classification), and different data characteristics (homophily vs heterophily).\n\nW3. [This is more of a comment rather than weakness.] The authors briefly mentioned the scalability issue in future work. At a high-level, this might be the #1 issue with current graph transformers, which prevents large scale deployment.\n\nMinor typos/presentation issues: \n\n- Intro: propose a novel Message Passing Transformer with **Considered** modifications --> Does not seem to be the right word here.\n\n- Below Eq. 4: Neglation --> Negation\n\n- I'm not sure how to read the where condition in Eq (5). \n\n- 5.3: (1) 'fold' --> should use a pair of inverted comma.\n(2) with a single train-test split.All ... --> space after full stop.\n\n- 5.4 last paragraph: it's --> it is (should avoid shorthands in formal writing)\n\n- 6/7 future work and related work can be combined together for a non-survey paper."

For global interaction, it just considers all graph nodes as tokens and applies the regular transformer model. It then concatenates the local and global representation of the node to obtain the final representation. The final model termed DBGT, is evaluated on node and graph level tasks."

The computation complexity is overlooked and not optimized. In Equation (10), it's just dense attention over the complete graph, which can cause huge computation cost for large graphs.\n3. The experiment performance does not support the generation capability of the proposed attention layer for different tasks. For example, the node classification performance does not beat the classical method like GAT, which utilizes the local attention layer."
