The goal of this transformation is to execute most DNN operators in GEMM kernels thus imrpoving computational effficiency. The evaluation on main stream DNN models and they discuss the inference accuracy aross different benchmarks."

                    "value": "GEMM is most widely used and optimized kernels in current deep learning community and converting all computation into GEMM would not only simplify the development pipeline, but also improve the overall efficiency. \n\nNeuralMatrix allows for the efficient support of a broad range of DNNs, including popular models in CNNs / Transformers and GNNs. It also achieves the levels of computing efficiency with previous hardware that is specially designed and optimized."

                    "value": "The first concern is that whether the topic is suitable for ICLR conference. Though ICLR does accept papers in framework and system, hardware design papers usually go to HPCA / ISCA / Micro. Could the authors clarify why this paper is a good fit for ICLR?\n\nThe design principle for NeuralMatrix is to converting all operators into linear OPs and obviously such a conversion is lossy. This requires the converstion and pipeline to be carefully designed and throughfully tested. However, current inference accuracy evaluation only include CIFAR10 on CNN, SST-2 on Transformers, and CORA on GNNs , which is not enough to convince users."

Enlarging it would improve the presentation. \n\nWhat is the cost of performance of post-finetuning? Would this be expensive for large language models?"
