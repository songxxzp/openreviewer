VITAL first enables lightweight model training using only 2% of parameters through automatic mode approximation. More importantly, VITAL enhances instruction semantics from two perspectives: 1) aggregating more context via enhanced instruction mixture to aid multimodal fusion, and 2) strengthening the connection between the proposed parameter-efficient tuning method and mutual information through a scored-based information bottleneck. Experiments on six multimodal benchmarks show VITAL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in most cases, even surpassing full fine-tuning performance."

The use of multiple instructions to extract the visual feature does not make much sense to me, since the original purpose of instructBLIP is to extract visual feature adaptively according to DIFFERENT instruction. If the author wishes to maintain all the visual features, why not directly feed all visual tokens from CLIP to the LLM, like in LLAVA?\n3. The experiments seem unconvincing, since the performance gain is marginal as shown in table 3."

The only new mechanism is fusing features output from weight-shared Q-Formers who take repeated visual features and different instructions as inputs, which is limited and does not deserve a good contribution.\n- Method\n  - Why use CP Decomposition-based Lora instead of standard Lora is unclear. Could the authors provide some insights behind it? \n  - The instruction mixture requires multiple forwards on Q-Former, which introduces extra computational costs and latency/throughput compared with other standard PEFT methods. It is unclear to what extent this mechanism will affect the overall computational cost and latency/throughput of the model.\n  - VITAL is only applicable for QFormer-involved models, for example, BLIP2[1]-based ones. However, recently more popular multimodal LLMs such as LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 v2 do not use Q-Former, which means the scope of application is limited.\n- Experiments\n  - Some baselines are missing. The comparison with other PEFT methods is not enough. More baselines, such as prompt tuning-based methods, have been mentioned in the related works but not compared.\n  - Some ablation studies are missing\n    - Comparisons with more simple strategies to achieve the instruction mixture are needed. For example, using the average of different outputs from Q-Former without weighting, or selecting the most important outputs while discarding others according to some significant metrics and ranking.\n    - Experiments conducted with different numbers of augmented instructions (k) are needed. It would be better to see a trade-off illustration between the model performance and k.\n  - Experiments on different modules (e.g., ViT and LLMs) other than Q-Former or on other model architectures (e.g., LLaVA[2] and MiniGPT-4[3]) are needed to verify the effectiveness of VITAL.\n  - The extra computational cost and latency/throughput introduced by the instruction mixture should be reported to make a fair comparison with other PEFT methods.\n\nReferences  \n[1] Blip-2: Bootstrapping language-image pre-training with frozen image encoders and large language models.  \n[2] Visual instruction tuning.  \n[3] Minigpt-4: Enhancing vision-language understanding with advanced large language models."
