In addition, it is hard to produce a depth map or canny edge without having the target image ready, and they cannot be easily altered. Therefore, the proposed image prompt appears neither as accessible nor as controllable as text prompt.\n\n* The paper's description on the method and the experiments are oversimplified and vague. In particular, I find little explanation on how the method achieves training-free reusability, which is a key point of this paper. I also find little information on how the model comes to understand the various types of \"structural conditioning\", i.e. image prompt. Many such questions remain after reading the paper and are listed below. They severely hurt the readability of this paper."

The model looks like a Transformer encoder rather than decoder - otherwise, what are the query and memory?\n\n- Also in Section 3.3, the \"Query Transformer ... started with 4 freely-learning global queries and 144 local queries\", What exactly are these queries? Where \"local\" comes from? \"The network also contains free-learned query embeddings, level embeddings, and optional 2D spatial embeddings\". I could not find the definition of these in the text or in any illustration.\n\n- As aforementioned, how the method achieves training-free reusability?\n\n- As aforementioned, how the model is trained to understand, and hence follows the instruction of, image prompts that comes in various forms? Are the image prompts illustrated in the paper, including depth map, canny edge, scribble, also in the training data?"

Eliminating text prompts will simply limit the potential abilities of the model. When you do not need a text prompt, it is fine to just set it as an empty string.\n2. Only several groups of qualitative examples are presented, while NO quantitative results are given.\n3. The effectiveness of the proposed Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder) module is not fully validated. The authors should conduct more experiments and ablation study to prove its value.\n4.

This framework relies solely on visual inputs, using a Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder) instead of text encoders like CLIP or LLM. Through experiments, Prompt-Free Diffusion is shown to outperform prior methods, match state-of-the-art T2I models, and extend to applications like anime figure generation and virtual try-on.
