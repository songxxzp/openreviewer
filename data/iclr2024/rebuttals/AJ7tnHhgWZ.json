I feel that the training-free strategy is a contribution of CBD. The author should explain why their method shows improvements in the training-free setting.\n\n**Latency and resources**\n\nTo make inference, the method needs to perform multiple forward-passes to obtain the embeddings of the descriptions. This can significantly increase latency of the model. If done in parallel, this still requires more resources, which can be challenging when deploying at scale. \n\n**Writing quality:**\n\nThe writing of this paper could be improved. For example, the prompt provided to the LLM for the Q part is not a question, and I am not sure conclude is the right word here.\n\nnit: It would be easier to read if the authors move Table 1 and Table 2 closer to their respective sections.\n\n**Missing prompt selection experiment:**\n\nIt would be nice to understand the effect of different prompts on the final evaluation metrics. \n\n**Missing references:**\n\nThere are several prior works that try to align the distributions of text and image embeddings. Since the authors also propose prompt tuning approaches, it is worth discussing them to provide references to the readers.\n\nChen, G., Yao, W., Song, X., Li, X., Rao, Y., & Zhang, K. (2022).

Could you incorporate some uncertainty mechanism of the LLMs into the weighting function? \n\n3. The training-free approach is very similar to CBD. CBD uses a mixture of the scores whereas your method uses a mixture of descriptions. Could you explain more on why your method shows improvement? \n\n4.  Can the authors explain why the aggregation is performed on the descriptions themselves instead of the scores? According to CBD, aggregating over scores offers more interpretability.\n\nThe paragraph below is taken from CBD.\n\n\"We note that one difference from ProtoNets (Snell et al., 2017) is that we compute the class\nscore s as the mean similarity to support vectors (i.e., descriptor) rather than the similarity to the\nmean of the support vectors. Aggregating similarities enables interpretability, as the class score can\nbe decomposed into similarity with each descriptor, more akin to Chen et al. (2019); Vinyals et al.\n(2017). Comparing to the mean of support vectors is essentially the approach of typical \u201cprompt\nensembling.\u201d\n\n5. Is it possible to construct Figure 1 from real data points? It would be more convincing."

                    "value": "Motivation: The logical chain of motivation in this paper is incomplete, as detailed below.\n1. The last part of the first paragraph of the Introduction lacks coherent logic. Is there any evidence, such as research papers or experimental results, to support the claim that poor interpretability of soft prompting leads to \"undermines the reliability of predictions and impedes improvements of the results\"?\n2.\tIs there any literature or experimental evidence to support Figure 1? \n3.\tIf there indeed exists a significant gap between plain text and image-text corpus, then a cross-modal soft prompting approach like MaPLe appears to be a more reasonable choice. It has the capability to simultaneously adjust the model from both modalities, dynamically reducing the distribution gap between text and image modalities. The authors need to explain how the proposed method compares to MaPLe, highlighting the disadvantages of MaPLe (beyond poor interpretability) and the advantages of the proposed approach.\n\nNovelty: In my view, the method proposed in this paper primarily combines the use of text prompts generated by large models with soft prompting. This essentially replaces manually designed text prompts with prompts generated by large pre-trained language models. The utilization of soft prompting is also a common practice. These two aspects, in my opinion, do not constitute fundamental innovation.\n\nExperiment: The experimental section of the paper has significant flaws, as outlined below:\n1.\tRelated works on Prompt Learning based on CLIP, such as CoOp, CoCoOp, and MaPLe, conducted experiments on 11 datasets. Why does this paper only experiment on 7 of them?\n2.\tThe paper lacks an extensive comparison with several recent relevant methods. For example, in a training-free setting the paper should also compare with the following papers:\n[1] Ge Y, Ren J, Gallagher A, et al. Improving Zero-shot Generalization and Robustness of Multi-modal Models[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023: 11093-11101.\n[2] Udandarao V, Gupta A, Albanie S. Sus-x: Training-free name-only transfer of vision-language models[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023: 2725-2736.\nFor example, in a few-shot setting the paper should also compare with the following papers. Among these methods, CoCoOp and MaPLe are well-known, and I believe that every researcher working on CLIP-based Prompt Learning has read these works. The authors even referenced CoCoOp in the paper, so I really can't understand why they didn't compare with them.\n[1] Zhou K, Yang J, Loy C C, et al. Conditional prompt learning for vision-language models[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022: 16816-16825.\n[2] Khattak M U, Rasheed H, Maaz M, et al.

Improving Zero-Shot Generalization for CLIP with Synthesized Prompts[C]//Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2023: 3032-3042.\n3.\tMany crucial ablation experiments are missing in the paper. Here are a few examples:\na)\tExperiments using larger pre-trained CLIP models as the backbone are absent. This is important because larger pre-trained models exhibit stronger text-image alignment capabilities. It's worth questioning whether the proposed method remains effective when using larger models.\nb)\tIt would be interesting to see the results of experiments where LLM-generated prompts are used for initialization, followed by soft prompting. Could this approach lead to further improvements?\nc)\tThe paper doesn't provide ablation experiments for several essential hyperparameters, such as the number of text prompts generated for each category (n) and the count of soft prompts (p and q). Understanding the impact of these hyperparameters is vital.\n4.\tThe experimental setup and result calculations are not adequately described. Typically, zero-shot or few-shot methods based on CLIP would partition the dataset into \"base\" and \"novel\" classes to separately evaluate zero-shot and few-shot performance. In this paper, there is only one result presented, and there's a lack of accompanying explanations, which is highly confusing.\n\nPresentation: The paper provides a clear description of the method, but it contains multiple typos:\n1.\tThe last sentence in the first paragraph of section 3.2.: \u201cFigure ??\u201d\n2.\tIn the last paragraph of section 3.3: m, n.\n3.\tIn Implementation Details of section 4.1: m, n should be p, q.\n4.\tIn Table1, Table2, Section 4.4, \u201cFVGC\u201d should be \u201cFGVC\u201d."

For example,\n    - leverage GPT-3 to produce textual inputs for prompting CLIP with rich downstream linguistic semantics (CVPR 2023: Prompt, Generate, Then Cache: Cascade of Foundation Models Makes Strong Few-Shot Learners ) or\n    - prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate informative language descriptions for object classes (ICML 2023 Multi-Modal Classifiers for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection).\n    \n    Hence, the idea of utilizing LLM to generate text descriptions that better align with image content is not necessarily a novel concept.\n    \n- From the perspective of experimental results, there are a few notable limitations in the paper.\n    - Firstly, the paper lacks performance results for four commonly used image classification datasets (UCF101, SUN397, Caltech101, and StanfordCars) from the CoOp dataset. It would be helpful to know how the proposed method performs on these specific datasets.\n    - Secondly, the paper only provides results for few-shot/zero-shot experiments, but it lacks generalization experiments such as base-to-new and variants of ImageNet. These types of experiments are also important in evaluating the overall performance and robustness of the proposed method.\n    - Lastly, the paper falls short in terms of comparing the proposed method with the latest advancements in the field. While CoOp and CLIP are considered as basic baselines for few-shot/zero-shot settings, there have been subsequent improvements in various research papers. The absence of discussions and comparisons with these advancements weakens the overall claims made by the authors.\n- From an interpretability standpoint, one limitation is that the paper does not provide the corresponding descriptions for the trained soft prompts. Without this information, it becomes difficult to understand the specific nature and characteristics of the soft prompts generated during training. Consequently, the overall interpretability of the approach remains limited when considering the entire prompt framework."
