                    "value": "Precipitation forecasting holds significant scientific and societal value. While data-driven techniques are increasingly popular in addressing forecasting challenges, they struggle with accurately representing the physics involved. Marrying AI post-processing with established Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods can bolster forecast accuracy. Yet, predicting heavy rainfall remains a hurdle, given uneven precipitation data and intricate meteorological variable interplays. This study presents the PostRainBench, a robust NWP post-processing benchmark comprising three datasets for enhanced precipitation forecasting. We introduce CAMT, a Channel Attention Enhanced Multi-task Learning framework, integrated with a tailored weighted loss function. This framework seamlessly merges with various backbones. Tests on our benchmark indicate that CAMT surpasses existing methods by notable margins, especially under extreme rainfall conditions. Significantly, our model is the pioneering deep learning tool that outdoes traditional NWP methods in predicting intense rain, showcasing its immense promise in mitigating extreme weather implications."

                        "value": "Q4.1: Claim of the first to surpass NWP.\n\nA4.1:\u00a0\n\nWe respectfully point out the key misunderstanding. To clarify, our assertion is that our model is the first to surpass NWP in the specific context of precipitation forecasting, particularly in extreme cases, within the realm of NWP post-processing tasks. This claim is based on three key criteria:\n\n1. Focus on Precipitation Forecasting: Our model specifically addresses precipitation forecasting, which distinguishes it from other studies. While recent models like Pangu [2] and FengWu [3] forecast various upper-air and surface weather variables, they do not include precipitation in their scope. Our work fills this gap by providing insights specifically for precipitation forecasting, contributing significant advancements in this area.\n2. NWP Post-processing Task: Our approach uniquely combines physics-based NWP results with AI methods in a post-processing task, a methodology that diverges from the purely data-driven deep learning methods employed in studies like Pangu and FengWu. This hybrid approach is in line with the future direction suggested in the Pangu study, which anticipates the combination of AI-based and NWP methods for improved performance.\n\n3. Excellence in Extreme Cases: The specific area where our model excels is in forecasting heavy rain, which we define as 'extreme cases' in our paper. This is a crucial distinction, as none of the deep learning models in the related work, including KoMet, have surpassed NWP in this particular aspect of heavy rain forecasting.\n\nRegarding NowcastNet [1], while it represents a significant advancement in using radar observations for weather prediction, its methodological framework differs from ours. NowcastNet relies on a data-driven approach without integrating physics-informed predictions (NWP Method), whereas our model is designed specifically for NWP post-processing, leveraging both AI and physics-based insights.\n\nIn summary, our claim of being the first to surpass NWP in the specific context of heavy rain forecasting in NWP post-processing tasks is based on these distinct aspects of our work. We believe this clarification underscores the unique contribution of our study in advancing the field of precipitation forecasting.\n\nQ4.2: Novelty of the method and rationale of design choices\n\nA4.2: \n\nPlease also refer to A2.1 for Reviewer Lop7. \n\nWe understand the reviewer's concerns regarding the perceived novelty of our model. It's true that our model integrates well-known elements like the Swin Transformer and Unet, creating what is known as SwinUnet. However, the innovation in our work extends beyond this integration, focusing on the unique application of these components to meet specific challenges in NWP post-processing tasks.\n\nChannel Attention Module (CAM) and Multi-task Learning: A central innovative aspect of our approach is the integration of CAM with multi-task learning. This combination specifically addresses the issue of imbalanced data distribution in weather forecasting. By selectively focusing on crucial weather variables through CAM, our model achieves enhanced predictive accuracy. Concurrently, multi-task learning offers a nuanced approach to managing the complexities inherent in various aspects of precipitation forecasting.\n\nInnovative Application of SwinUnet for Precipitation Forecasting: Our major contribution lies in the novel application of the SwinUnet architecture, adapted to address real-world challenges in precipitation forecasting. The Swin Transformer, known for its effectiveness in feature extraction within the realm of computer vision, is here repurposed in a hierarchical transformer-based method tailored for NWP post-processing tasks. This marks a significant first in applying such an architecture to this specific area.\n\nThe task itself necessitated an innovative approach, leading us to adopt state-of-the-art models like SwinUnet to effectively tackle the challenges of NWP post-processing. Our model isn't just a mere combination of existing technologies; it's a tailored solution addressing an under-explored and crucial area in weather forecasting.\n\nIn summary, the innovation of our model is rooted in its application and the substantial improvements it brings to precipitation forecasting. This includes addressing the challenge of imbalanced data and enhancing the robustness of forecasting models, thereby contributing valuable advancements to the field.\n\nIn order to ensure the reproducibility of our research, we have included both the code and the relevant data in the supplementary materials."

                        "value": "Q4.3: Comparison with recent significant works\n\nA4.3: \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the inclusion of comprehensive baselines in our paper. While OpenSTL [4] represents a comprehensive benchmark for spatiotemporal forecasting, our work focuses on NWP post-processing tasks, which differ from the typical spatiotemporal prediction task of inputting N frames to output N frames.\n\nIn our benchmark, we have defined two specific tasks:\n\n1. Sequence to Image Prediction (Korea Dataset): Here, we input N frames to predict 1 frame under fixed lead times varying from 6 to 87 hours.\n\n2. Image-to-Image Translation Prediction (Germany and China Datasets): This involves inputting 1 frame to predict the future frame under a fixed 3-hour lead time. Notably, these experiments, especially on the latter two datasets, do not involve temporal information.\nAs such, our NWP post-processing tasks are distinct from the typical input-output frame prediction models used in OpenSTL [4]. This difference in task nature and requirements is why we have not included a comparison with the spatiotemporal forecasting methods in OpenSTL in our study.\n\nIn selecting our baselines, we choose models like ConvLSTM, which is recurrent-based, and U-Net, which is recurrent-free, along with the MetNet network, specifically designed for precipitation forecasting. Our proposed SwinUnet model is also a recurrent-free method.\nAcknowledging the reviewer's valuable input, we have included additional experiments with the latest FourCastNet as a baseline. We maintained consistent settings with baseline models for the respective dataset and averaged results over three random seeds. \n\nWe have supplemented this result in Section A.5 in the appendix.\n\nKorea Dataset\n\n|             | CSI_Rain(Mean/Std) | CSI_Rain(Best) | HSS_Rain(Mean/Std) | HSS_Rain(Best) | CSI_Heavy(Mean/Std) | CSI_Heavy(Best) | HSS_Heavy(Mean/Std) | HSS_Heavy(Best) |\n| :---------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- |\n| FourCastNet | 0.314(0.016)       | 0.325          | **0.391(0.023)**   | **0.409**      | 0.011(0.008)        | 0.017           | 0.020(0.014)        | 0.029           |\n| Ours        | **0.321(0.005)**   | **0.326**      | 0.384(0.007)       | 0.389          | **0.052(0.010)**    | **0.058**       | **0.089(0.017)**    | **0.097**       |\n\nGermany Dataset\n\n|             | CSI_Rain(Mean/Std) | CSI_Rain(Best) | HSS_Rain(Mean/Std) | HSS_Rain(Best) | CSI_Heavy(Mean/Std) | CSI_Heavy(Best) | HSS_Heavy(Mean/Std) | HSS_Heavy(Best) |\n| :---------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- |\n| FourCastNet | 0.494(0.009)       | 0.504          | 0.595(0.009)       | 0.601          | 0.157(0.034)        | 0.185           | 0.265(0.051)        | 0.306           |\n| Ours        | **0.514(0.003)**   | **0.518**      | **0.609(0.006)**   | **0.616**      | **0.209(0.014)**    | **0.224**       | **0.339(0.020)**    | **0.359**       |\n\nChina Dataset\n\n|             | CSI_Rain(Mean/Std) | CSI_Rain(Best) | HSS_Rain(Mean/Std) | HSS_Rain(Best) | CSI_Heavy(Mean/Std) | CSI_Heavy(Best) | HSS_Heavy(Mean/Std) | HSS_Heavy(Best) |\n| :---------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :----------------- | :------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------ | :-------------- |\n| FourCastNet | 0.163(0.006)       | 0.167          | 0.219(0.010)       | 0.230          | 0.114(0.013)        | 0.129           | 0.166(0.023)        | 0.192           |\n| Ours        | **0.208(0.007)**   | **0.216**      | **0.274(0.014)**   | **0.289**      | **0.145(0.015)**    | **0.163**       | **0.225(0.019)**    | **0.246**       |\n\nFor the Korea dataset, our model exhibits superior performance to FourCastNet in both rain CSI and heavy rain CSI metrics, with a marginal shortfall in rain HSS, where it trails by 1.8% behind FourCastNet. It is important to highlight that FourCastNet's predictive capability does not surpass that of NWP algorithms for heavy rain scenarios.\n\nRegarding the Germany dataset, our model demonstrates an advancement over FourCastNet in all metrics for both rain and heavy rain, whereas FourCastNet does not demonstrate an advantage over NWP algorithms in heavy rain predictions.\n\nFor the China dataset, our model demonstrates comprehensive outperformance across all metrics when compared to FourCastNet. While FourCastNet posts a modest 3.6% gain over NWP methods in heavy rain forecasting, our approach achieves a substantial 31.8% improvement, marking a significant enhancement in predictive accuracy"

I would suggest rewriting and changing the paper to restate the adjustments to the solution."

                        "value": "Q2.1: Novelty of the proposed method.\n\nA2.1:\nFirstly, We would like to highlight the novel contributions of our work in task formulation.\n\n\u00a0In addressing the reviewer's comment on the innovation aspect of our model, we would like to emphasize our significant contribution to an under-explored task in NWP post-processing. Our comprehensive benchmark introduces a novel approach to this task, encompassing two distinct settings: image-to-image translation with fixed lead time, and sequence-to-image under the same fixed lead time conditions.\n\nThe innovative essence of our work lies in its problem-solving orientation. Based on our prior observations, despite deep learning models surpassing NWP in general rainfall prediction, a gap remained in their ability to outperform NWP models in forecasting heavy precipitation. Our proposed solution specifically addresses this challenge. We have supplemented our research with experimental results from the state-of-the-art network, FourCastNet, which also could not achieve better forecasting performance than NWP in heavy rain. This inability of existing advanced models to surpass NWP in heavy rain forecasting highlights the novelty and significance of our contribution.\n\nOur work provides key insights into resolving this critical issue in precipitation forecasting, offering a pragmatic and effective approach to enhance predictive performance in extreme weather conditions. This not only demonstrates our model's innovative application but also its potential impact and value in real-world meteorological scenarios.\n\nSecondly, we would like to highlight the novel contributions of our work, particularly in the context of multi-task learning and the Channel Attention Module (CAM):\n\n1. Innovative Application of Multi-task Learning in Precipitation Forecasting: While multi-task learning is indeed a known optimization method, our research takes a unique approach by being the first to utilize regression to aid classification in data-imbalanced precipitation forecasting. Drawing inspiration from recent research [1] which suggests adding a classification loss in imbalanced data scenarios for regression tasks, our study extends this concept in a novel direction. We propose that for classification tasks with imbalanced data, integrating a regression loss can be beneficial. This approach deviates from traditional radar-based nowcasting tasks that predominantly rely on weighted loss for regression. Our contribution lies in introducing a new perspective to the optimization problem, potentially benefiting a broader spectrum of research within this domain.\n\n2. Pioneering Use of CAM in Weather Variable Relation Modeling: Regarding the Channel Attention Model (CAM), our work stands out as the first to apply this mechanism to the complex task of modeling relationships between weather variables. Unlike general computer vision tasks, which often assume channel independence, our research bridges the gap between computer vision and weather forecasting by providing an innovative application of CAM. This integration is a significant step forward in enhancing the interpretability and efficacy of weather prediction models.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Pintea, S. L., Lin, Y., Dijkstra, J., & van Gemert, J. C. (2023). A step towards understanding why classification helps regression. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 19972-19981).\n\nQ2.2: Mechanisms within model to address the data imbalance issue.\n\nA2.2: \n\nWe understand the reviewer's concern regarding the data imbalance issue and the necessity to address it within our model. As mentioned in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of our paper, our approach to mitigating the impact of data imbalance involves two key strategies: weighted loss and multi-task learning.\n\n\u25cfWeighted Loss: We employ a weighted loss mechanism to counterbalance the disproportionate representation of classes in our dataset. This method assigns greater importance to underrepresented classes, ensuring they have a significant impact on the model's learning process. However, we recognize that a simple weighted loss approach can sometimes lead to over-forecasting in smaller classes.\n\n\u25cfMulti-task Learning: To alleviate the over-forecasting issue, we integrate multi-task learning into our framework. This technique not only addresses the imbalanced nature of the dataset but also improves the model's generalization capabilities by learning shared representations across multiple tasks. Multi-task learning provides a more holistic approach to managing data imbalance, enhancing the model's performance and predictive accuracy."

The experimental results reported in our paper represent the average performance across different lead times within this 6-87 hour range. \n\nAs shown in Figure 4 in the appendix of the revised PDF, within the lead time interval of 6 to 20, we observe that the CSI for rain reaches a peak at a lead time of 10 before exhibiting a declining trend, whereas the CSI for heavy rain peaks at a lead time of 9, subsequently showing a fluctuating trajectory. Expanding the analysis to a lead time range of 6 to 87, both rain and heavy rain CSI exhibit parallel trends, with heavy rain demonstrating superior performance over extended lead times, likely reflective of inherent data characteristics. Across all evaluated lead times from 6 to 87, our model's mean performance is enhanced, underscoring the comprehensive superiority of our modeling approach.\n\nFor the Germany and China datasets, the lead time is set at a fixed 3 hours, corresponding to the paired format in which NWP predictions and precipitation observations are provided.\n\nIn summary, while our approach adapts to the fixed 3-hour lead time in the Germany and China datasets, our comprehensive analysis and additional experiments on the Korea dataset underscore the versatility and robustness of our method across a range of lead times, affirming its applicability in varied precipitation forecasting contexts.\n\nQ2.4: Weakness particularly in handling imbalanced data distributions.\n\nA2.4:\n\nDiscussion of Weakness:\n\nOne limitation of our model is the empirical selection of weights for the hyperparameters. Future research could explore an adaptive loss mechanism within a multi-task learning framework. \n\n\u25cfEmpirical Selection of Weights: A key limitation lies in our approach to the empirical selection of weights for hyperparameters. This process is closely tied to the dataset's distribution, which can vary significantly in real-world scenarios. Due to this reliance, the model's performance might be overly dependent on the specific characteristics of the dataset used for training, potentially reducing its effectiveness when applied to datasets with different distributions.\n\n\u25cfPotential for Adaptive Loss Mechanisms: Recognizing this limitation, we suggest that future research could explore the development of adaptive loss mechanisms within a multi-task learning framework. An adaptive approach would allow for more dynamic adjustment of weights based on the data distribution, potentially improving the model's handling of imbalanced datasets. This could lead to more nuanced and effective learning, especially in scenarios where data imbalances are pronounced and complex.\n\nIn summary, while our current model presents a solid foundation, its approach to weight selection and handling of imbalanced data could benefit from further refinement. The exploration of adaptive loss mechanisms, particularly in conjunction with multi-task learning strategies, represents a promising avenue for enhancing the model's robustness and versatility in diverse data scenarios."

A more technical innovation is anticipated for a prestigious ML conference. Furthermore, a 3-hour lead time is not an interesting time zone for NWP post-processing, as NWP data is typically employed for lead times exceeding 6 hours. For example, MetNet2 leverages NWP for enhancing performance over longer lead times."

Conversely, the integration of our proposed Channel Attention Module (CAM) and Weighted Loss (WL) resulted in a downward trend of the loss over epochs (Figure 6), indicating effective learning of the data distribution and improved generalizability of the model.\n\nThe CAM, with its targeted focus on salient features, and the WL, which addresses class imbalance, have shown a discernible positive influence on the model's learning process, as demonstrated by a consistent reduction in validation loss. This reduction substantiates our method's capability to tackle the specific challenges associated with precipitation forecasting in imbalanced datasets.\n\nUltimately, the depicted loss curves validate our method's proficiency in grasping the complexities of the forecasting task, where the integrated components not only counteract overfitting but also significantly bolster the model's forecasting accuracy.\n\nQ1.2: Limitation and applications.\n\nA1.2:\n\nDiscussion of limitations:\n\nOne limitation of our model is the empirical selection of weights for the hyperparameters.

Our released models can be directly used to improve extreme precipitation forecasting. We have shown significant improvements of 15.6%, 17.4%, and 31.8% on the Korea, Germany, and China datasets, respectively, over NWP methods.  In the current weather forecasting landscape, NWP methods are predominantly used, with meteorologists often manually performing bias correction on some results. Our method offers a deep learning-based approach for more accurate correction in extreme precipitation forecasting. \n\n2. Our benchmark can be used to develop efficient DL models as additions to NWP methods for precipitation forecasting. Given that this area remains under-explored, our benchmark and research have significant practical value and are poised to stimulate further studies in this domain."

                        "value": "Q1.3: Experiments of different lead times.\n\nA1.3:\n\n\u00a0We have supplemented this in Section A.6 with additional results for lead times from 6 to 87 hours on the test set to provide a more detailed view of our model's performance over varying lead times.\n\nFor the Korea dataset, we follow the setup of previous studies, selecting samples with various lead times ranging from 6 to 87 hours for our training, validation, and testing sets. The experimental results reported in our paper represent the average performance across different lead times within this 6-87 hour range. \n\nAs shown in Figure 4 in the appendix of the revised PDF, within the lead time interval of 6 to 20, we observe that the CSI for rain reaches a peak at a lead time of 10 before exhibiting a declining trend, whereas the CSI for heavy rain peaks at a lead time of 9, subsequently showing a fluctuating trajectory. Expanding the analysis to a lead time range of 6 to 87, both rain and heavy rain CSI exhibit parallel trends, with heavy rain demonstrating superior performance over extended lead times, likely reflective of inherent data characteristics. Across all evaluated lead times from 6 to 87, our model's mean performance is enhanced, underscoring the comprehensive superiority of our modeling approach.\n\nFor the Germany and China datasets, the lead time is set at a fixed 3 hours, corresponding to the paired format in which NWP predictions and precipitation observations are provided.\n\nIn summary, while our approach adapts to the fixed 3-hour lead time in the Germany and China datasets, our comprehensive analysis and additional experiments on the Korea dataset underscore the versatility and robustness of our method across a range of lead times, affirming its applicability in varied precipitation forecasting contexts.\n\nQ1.4: Suggestion for reproducibility\n\nA1.4:\n\nWe fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of reproducibility in benchmark studies, particularly in the field of climate science. To address this, we are committed to ensuring that our work is as transparent and replicable as possible.\n\nWe have provided the code and data in the supplementary material."
