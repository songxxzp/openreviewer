Is this important? It seems that it just depends on whether you update the policy or the Q-value function first and the order that you assign the superscript of the Q-value function.

Due to time constraints, I have not thoroughly reviewed the entire proof. I will try to check the proof recently, and I believe resolving the following issues will enhance my comprehension of this paper:\n\n- It appears that Algorithm 1 closely resembles the OPPO+ algorithm introduced by [Zhong and Zhang, 2023], with the main difference being the policy switching update. I am curious whether this straightforward modification alone leads to the achievement of $\\sqrt{T}$ regret, or if the authors have introduced novel proof techniques to support their claims.\n\n- The algorithm design and proof techniques applied in this paper seem notably distinct from the concurrent work presented by [Sherman et al., 2023]. I am interested in understanding how these two works independently derive the $\\sqrt{T}$ regret, and would appreciate the authors' insights on this matter.\n\n- If Algorithm OPORS bears a strong resemblance to OPPO or OPPO+, it raises questions regarding its significant outperformance compared to OPPO+ empirically. In prior research, OPPO from [Cai et al., 2020] was found to be on par or slightly superior to LSVI-UCB. However, the absence of the provided source code prevents me from verifying whether the authors have properly tuned the hyperparameters of both algorithms to ensure a fair comparison. It would be valuable if the authors could briefly explain this phenomenon and, if feasible, include the source code in the supplementary materials for transparency."

It's important to note that tackling adversarial rewards, as accomplished by previous policy-optimization methods, presents a more challenging task. Therefore, the contribution of the OPORS algorithm is limited. Furthermore, even in the context of stochastic rewards, a comparison with the optimal algorithm in He et al. 2023 indicates that the OPORS algorithm has a similar computational cost, albeit with the additional dependencies on d and H in the regret guarantee.\n\n[1] Rate-optimal policy optimization or linear markov decision processes\n\n[2] Nearly minimax optimal reinforcement learning for linear Markov decision processes.\nthe regret guarantee has extra d,H dependency \n\n2. The proof of key Lemma 3.4 is incorrect. At the beginning of the page 16, the proof appears to have a technique flaw in the step where it uses the fact that $0 \\leq k_{i+1} - k_i \\leq K$ to establish $(k_{i+1} - k_i) \\cdot \\text{gap}(D_{KL}) \\leq K \\cdot \\text{gap}(D_{KL}).$ This indeed assumes that $\\text{gap}(D_{KL})$ is greater than zero, which has not been adequately proven in the context of the proof.\n\n3. Regarding computational cost, it's essential to consider that Wang et al. 2021 [1] and He et al. 2023 [2] have also introduced the rare-switching policy technique, reducing the frequency of policy updates to $O(dH\\log T)$. Consequently, it's reasonable to expect that these algorithms might exhibit a similar computational cost to the OPORS algorithm. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct a comprehensive computational complexity analysis and experiments, comparing these algorithms, before asserting a \"significantly reduced computation cost.\"\n\n[1] Provably efficient reinforcement learning with linear function approximation under adaptivity constraints.\n\n[2] Nearly minimax optimal reinforcement learning for linear Markov decision processes.\n\n4. In the context of policy optimization, it's worth noting that the policy is updated using the Exp3 method (as indicated in Line 10 of OPORS), and the optimistic value function is computed with respect to the policy (Line 11 in OPORS). While this approach may pose additional computational challenges compared to UCB-type algorithms, it raises questions about the computational complexity of OPORS when dealing with larger state-action spaces. To address these concerns, it would be beneficial if the author could provide a detailed computational analysis of the policy updating process or conduct simulations with larger state-action spaces to assess the algorithm's performance in such scenarios."

This factor is attributed to policy optimization error (2), as indicated by the regret decomposition in Cai et al. 2020 [1] and Lemma 3.4. It is noteworthy that most policy optimization methods for linear function approximation exhibit a $\\log |A|$ dependency. Addressing this issue could be of independent interest for researchers aiming to remove this factor.\n\n[1] Provably efficient exploration in policy optimization\n\n\n2. The computation cost analysis and experiments in the paper predominantly focus on the linear function approximation (OPORS algorithm). It is important for the author to explicitly state whether the same analysis applies to the general function approximation $F-OPORS$ algorithm in the introduction.\n\n3. There is an error in the additional related works section concerning He et al. (2023) [1]. The reference should be corrected, as the work in question does not use the policy optimization method and instead combines Bernstein-type concentration inequality, rare-switching policy, and a monotonic variance estimator to achieve optimal regret in linear MDPs, which has already been discussed in the RL with linear function approximation section.

In my view, the rare policy switches can effectively reduce the log covering number of the value function class, and [1] fails to get the optimal bound since they use the multi-batched updating, and the batch $l = O(\\sqrt{K})$, which means there are still $O(\\sqrt{K})$ different policies and this increases the covering number of policy class.\n\n2. Can authors give some statistical intuition of improving the regret bound of [2]? \n\n[1] Han Zhong and Tong Zhang.
