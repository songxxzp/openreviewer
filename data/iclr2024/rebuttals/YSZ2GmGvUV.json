How do these experimental results support the aforementioned argument?

                        "value": "**1. About the difference between our paper and Universal Perturbations:**\n\nAlthough trigger features can be regarded as a kind of universal perturbation that lies in eigenspace corresponding to the top singular value, the former work doesn\u2019t show that trigger features are low rank and can only lie in top eigenspace. Furthermore, the relationship between the feature dimensions and backdoor accuracy during training as shown in Figure 1 is only unevaluatedin our paper. Therefore, the new findings of our paper are that the trigger features can only located in the top low-rank subspaces. Such a phenomenon may be caused by the low poison rate of the trigger samples. \n\nFurthermore, we also designed our new method by damping top singular values and using features corresponding to more eigenspace for prediction. Therefore, models with our module can naturally defend against many backdoor attacks.\n\n**2. About \u201clack of evidence that the unlearning will lead to bad natural accuracy\u201d and \u201c finetuning is better than EigenGuard\u201d:**\n\nFrom Table 3, one can see that ABL\u2019s natural performance is not good, which is caused by its unlearning loss. \n\nAs for finetuning, its natural accuracy may be better sometimes because they use additional clean datasets for finetuning while ours do not. But its backdoor accuracy is not stable which means that fine-tuning is not an effective way for backdoor defense.\n\n**3. About why modifying eigenspace will not cause the accuracy drops:**\n\nBecause we do not drop features, we only rescale the singular values corresponding to each eigenspace.  As our experiments show, the trigger features only lie in a low-rank space with large singular values, our method will lead neural networks to make predictions based on more features instead of trigger features. Therefore, natural features will help the neural network to predict natural labels instead of trigger labels on backdoor samples. \n\nAs for natural samples, one can notice that models with our EigenGuard do not drop any information. Therefore, the natural performance will not be affected.\n\n**4. Why not just let top singular values to zero?**\n\nJust removing the top eigenspace will make the natural accuracy drop because features corresponding to top singular values are also important for natural classification, as shown in the following experiments:\n\n| Methods | ACC. | ASR. |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Remove top 10 Singulars  |  $85.4\\%$   |  $4.2\\%$   |\n| Ours | $92.6\\%$     |  $5.3\\%$   |\n\n\nOur method tries to avoid trigger features dominating the prediction. According to our theory, if the trigger features not dominating, which means the corresponding singular value is not large, the rest natural features will help models predict other classes instead of natural classes.\n\n**5. About the 0.001 scaling factor.**\n\nThis parameter will not influence much, we don\u2019t set it to zero because we think the gradient corresponds to the latter eigenspace may also help. But in fact, such a hyper-parameter will not influence much.\n\n**6. About the theoretical proof.**\n\nOur theory illustrates that damping the dominating trigger features may make the models use natural features to make correct predictions. It is also consistent with our method, we make the top singular values smaller to avoid the triggers dominating classifications.\n\n**7. About more baselines:**\n\nAs for baselines, we choose the most effective attacks and defenses as baselines according to BackdoorBench, since we use its setting for evaluation. We also add some defense methods(NAD[1], Spectral signature (SS)[2]) and attack methods (WaNet[3], SSBA[4]) on CIFAR-10. The full table is shown below:"

                        "value": "Thanks for your review, the following are our responses.\n\n**1. About the possible adaptive attacks:**\n\nA possible adaptive attack is trying to expand the trigger feature space and make it as complicated as the natural features. Then only damping top eigenspaces for features is not useful because trigger features are varied enough and no natural features are used for classification. \n\nHowever, we think it is not easy to achieve because too complicated backdoor features will also make the backdoor not easy to implement. Because the success of backdoor attacks benefits from the simple shortcuts between trigger features and labels. Therefore, the attack may be less effective when trigger features are complicated.\n\n**2. About CLB attacks and the choice of baselines.**\n\nWe also evaluate the CLB attacks on CIFAR-100 and GTSRB attacks. And the results show that our methods are also effective. As for the choice of baselines, we choose the most effective attacks and defenses as baselines according to BackdoorBench, since we use its setting for evaluation. We also add some defense methods(NAD[1], Spectral Signature (SS[2]) defense ) and attack methods (WaNet[3],SSBA[4]) on CIFAR-10.

                    "value": "The paper proposes a novel defense method called EigenGuard to mitigate backdoor attacks on deep neural networks. The authors first analyze the spectral behavior of features in neural networks and observe that backdoor features tend to exhibit a concentrated behavior within the spectral space, while natural features are distributed in a high-dimensional space. Based on these observations, the authors propose the EigenGuard module, which forces the top k spectral features to share the same scale during training. This module effectively neutralizes the impact of backdoor connections while preserving the natural performance of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that EigenGuard outperforms three existing defense methods in terms of both backdoor attack success rate and natural accuracy."

                    "value": "I have a few concerns regarding the proposed method and experiments\uff1a\n\n- The defense strategy hinges on the premise that backdoor features and genuine features are distributed in distinct spectral spaces. This foundational idea has already been explored by prior works such as [1, 2] for backdoor mitigation. While this paper implements the theory to devise algorithms that defense backdoor attacks during model training, the theoretical underpinning raises questions regarding its novelty.\n\n- The paper overlooks some of the more recent developments in backdoor attacks and defenses. As a result, the experiments lack a comprehensive scope. Omissions include backdoor attacks like [3-6] and backdoor defenses during training such as those presented in [7, 8]. For a more holistic overview, the paper may refer to existing work [9].\n\nOther questions: \n\n- I feel the details of the threat model are missing.\n\n- Some terms such as **$A$** in formula 1 and $k, \\sigma_k$ in algorithm 1 are unclear.\n\n- It is confusing why the CLB is not considered for experiments (e.g, Cifar100 and GTSRB).\n\n- From Table 3, it's observed that some models, when defended with EigenGuard, exhibit improved accuracy compared to when no defense is applied.

About our theoretical analysis:**\n\nAlthough our toy model is simple, our theory can clearly illustrate that damping the dominating trigger features will lead the models to use natural features to make correct predictions. It is consistent with our method, we make the top singular values smaller to avoid the triggers dominating classifications.\n\n**2. About the baselines in our paper:**\n\nAs for the choice of baselines, we choose the most effective attacks and defenses as baselines according to BackdoorBench, since we use its setting for evaluation. We also add some defense methods (NAD[1] and Spectral Signature [2]) and attack methods(WaNet[3] and SSBA[4]) on CIFAR-10. The results show that our method can perform well on different attacks. The full table is shown below:\n\n|                     | | Types             | None                 | FT                     | ANP                   | ***NAD***                    | ***SS***                    | ABL                   | EigenGuard            |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| C10                 | ASR               | BadNets              | $100\\%$                | $3.0\\%$               | $0.5\\%$                | $6.7\\%$  | $99.7\\%$ | $3.1\\%$  | $5.3\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $100\\%$                | $10.2\\%$              | $0.5\\%$                | $3.8\\%$  | $100\\%$  | $15.2\\%$ | $0.4\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | CLB                  | $100\\%$                | $1.2\\%$               | $4.0\\%$                | $21.7\\%$ | $88.3\\%$ | $0.1\\%$ | $1.0\\%$              |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $94.2\\%$               | $0.4\\%$               | $0.3\\%$                | $6.8\\%$  | $89.1\\%$ | $0.01\\%$   | $2.8\\%$           |\n|                     |                   | ***WaNet***                | $92.3\\%$  | $15.1\\%$ | $1.7\\%$   | $28.9\\%$ | $90.1\\%$ | $2.3\\%$  | $8.8\\%$|\n|                     |                   | ***SSBA***                 | $100\\%$   | $23.7\\%$ | $0.9\\%$   | $100\\%$  | $88.3\\%$ | $4.4\\%$  | $17.1\\%$|\n|                     | ACC               | BadNets              | $93.7\\%$               | $87.2\\%$              | $90.2\\%$        x       | $90.1\\%$ | $92.3\\%$ | $89.1\\%$  | $92.6\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $94.8\\%$               | $88.9\\%$              | $93.4\\%$               | $93.3\\%$ | $93.1\\%$ | $88.7\\%$  | $93.5\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | CLB                  | $93.8\\%$               | $91.9\\%$              | $92.7\\%$               | $91.8\\%$ | $92.4\\%$ | $89.3\\%$  | $93.3\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $93.6\\%$               | $91.6\\%$              | $93.4\\%$               | $92.1\\%$ | $91.9\\%$ | $89.0\\%$  | $92.9\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | WaNet                | $92.7\\%$  | $93.5\\%$ | $90.5\\%$  | $92.2\\%$ | $87.4\\%$ | $88.5\\%$ | $92.7\\%$|\n|                     |                   | SSBA    | $92.8\\%$  | $89.7\\%$ | $88.7\\%$  | $92.3\\%$ | $71.5\\%$ | $85.6\\%$ | $93.1\\%$|\n| C100  | ASR             | BadNets              | $99.9\\%$               | $8.9\\%$               | $6.6\\%$                | -        | -        | $8.8\\%$               | $7.8\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $100\\%$                | $78.1\\%$              | $3.1\\%$                | -        | -        | $0.5\\%$               |  $0.4\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $87.5\\%$               | $78.6\\%$              | $55.5\\%$               | -        | -        | $2.1\\%$               |  $0.4\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | ***CLB***     | $100\\%$   | $5.1\\%$  | $6.7\\%$   | -        | -        | $4.3\\%$  | $3.8\\%$|\n|                     | ACC | BadNets              | $71.8\\%$               | $68.2\\%$              | $69.7\\%$               | -        | -        | $66.8\\%$              | $74.1\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $73.7\\%$               | $66.8\\%$              | $67.4\\%$               | -        | -        | $62.3\\%$              | $74.8\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $74.5\\%$               | $60.7\\%$              | $63.1\\%$               | -        | -        | $65.3\\%$              | $74.9\\%$ |\n|                     |                   | ***CLB***     | $74.6\\%$  | $62.1\\%$ | $64.7\\%$  | -        | -        | $66.2\\%$ | $74.5\\%$ |"

The phenomenon may caused by its dataset split being parametric sensitive and the undetected few backdoor samples that are not detected can also lead to backdoor behavior in backdoor training, which also demonstrates that the detection and retraining defense methods are unstable.\n\n**3. About the novelty of our methods.**\n\nOur work is different from [1],[2]:\n\n(1) First, the spectral tools are a widely used method in analysis. Therefore, the novelty of our work and former works like you proposed are the findings, not the analysis methods. And the findings and perspectives of former works and ours are different.\n\n[1] analyzes the feature activation difference on natural and backdoor samples for a pre-trained model and [2] analyzes the gradient defense. However, our work mainly focuses on the relationship between the rank and spectrum of the trigger feature space with the attack success rate, shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. Then we conclude that trigger features\u2019 rank is much smaller than natural features and the reason for backdoor behavior is attributed to triggers dominating the other features, which means their corresponding singular values are larger than others. Then we propose our defense method by averaging all useful features to lead the model to make the correct prediction. \n\n(2) Secondly, the goals of these works are different. [1] tries to split datasets and retrain the model. Then they need a complicated multi-stage training procedure. [2] tries to defend against the backdoor attack with additional clean data.\n\nHowever, our goal is more challenging. We would like to allow users to do end-to-end training without the concern of possible triggers in their datasets by just adding our module to their model.\n\n[1] Spectral signatures in backdoor attacks. Advances in neural information processing systems, 31.\n\n[2] Efficient Backdoor Removal Through Natural Gradient Fine-tuning. \n\n**4. About the threat model that our paper tries to address?**\n\nOur paper tries to achieve safe natural training against unauthorized backdoor datasets by involving a new module in the training models. With such a module, users can naturally train their models safely on unauthorized datasets without the need to adopt different methods for retraining, and purifying datasets which are both time-consuming and unstable.\n\nThe majority of model users who do not know backdoor attacks will just collect data and train them without purifying the data. Our methods are trying to protect this part of users by involving our module in released ResNet codes or other model codes."

About the CLB attack.**\n\nWe also evaluate the CLB attacks on CIFAR-100 and GTSRB datasets as shown in the above table. And the results show that our methods are also effective.\n\n**7. About the improvement of the natural accuracy.**\n\nI think the improvement of the natural accuracy is caused by the EigenGuard module can also regularize the neural network by damping the top singular values. Therefore, our EigenGuard can make neural networks\u2019 activation to be well-conditioned. It can avoid overfitting in some circumstances and lead to better results."

However, some of my concerns are still not addressed.\n\nFirst, if my understanding is correct, when comparing with new baselines, EigenGuard has a high ASR (all cases for Wanet, SSBA, and some cases for CLB. The differences are large). I am concerned if it means the proposed method cannot defense the attacks effectively, especially for stealthy attacks. If this method does not yield better defense performance, it will be important to explore other necessities for deploying this method. Also, I know that EigenGuard may provide better BA, but it is usually not the main focus of backdoor defenses.\n\nSecondly, the threat model means the assumptions about the attack, e.g., whether the defender needs to control to the dataset or the model itself, whether model need to be modified, etc. Including more details for the assumptions could help."

                        "value": "Thanks for your reply. Here is our further clarification:\n1. We don't think the success rate for new attacks and CLB attacks is high. The attack success rate shows that our model's prediction is worse than the random prediction, even the worst result SSBA is also around the random guess (10% for CIFAR-$10$). Therefore, we think the defense is successful. In the meantime, I think natural accuracy is also important because it means the utility of the models. For example, all defense methods show a clear drop in the CIFAR-100 dataset, which means these models are somehow useless.\n2. About threat models, the defender can only modify their model architecture, they cannot modify the training code or datasets. Such a scenario is untouched but also realistic. For example, in distributed training, other participants cannot control the datasets or the training procedure. Furthermore, in most cases,  many users won't purify their downloaded datasets and do complicated multi-stage training. Then adding our modules can make them free from backdoor threats. Since our module shows no clear degeneration in models' natural performance on various models, such a method can be directly used in any model's code like BatchNorm or ReLU."

However, after careful consideration, I think the novelty and evaluation of the paper are still not enough for me to give a clear acceptance. I think there are two main problems. One is that other work has already proposed similar concepts and the additional theoretical analysis for this paper is too abstract. The second problem is on the evaluation setting. While the rebuttal provides results on more baselines, the evaluation scale is limited and the performance against recent attacks is concerning. The evaluation results are also unstable, making me wonder the generalization of the proposed method."

The paper first investigates the singular value decomposition of the of the activation layer of neural networks. These investigations reveal that the dominant singular values of the activation layer preserve relative information of the clean vs. backdoor data, while the low-energy singular values mix them together. Motivated by this observation, this paper proposes EigenGuard. In short, EigenGuard uses a spectral filter to lower the significance of the low-energy singular values to combat backdoor attacks. Experimental results over CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and GTSRB shows that the proposed method effectively combat backdoor attacks such as BadNets, Blend, SIG, and Clean Label attacks."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- The paper starts its discussions in the introduction by stating inaccurate facts about the state of existing backdoor defenses. In particular, the paper says: \"_When attempting to train a clean model on unauthorized datasets, existing methods typically try to\nfine-tune the neural networks on some additional datasets..._\" While this was the case for older backdoor defense methods, recently, there has been quite a good progress in proposing methods that do not necessarily require clean held-out validation set to mitigate backdoor attack. For example, see [1-4]. Additionally, saying that \"_With the uncontaminated datasets split after the detection, we can train the model to unlearn backdoor triggers with designed unlearning loss._\" about Spectral Signatures (Tran et al. [1]) is inaccurate. We know that this method has a two-step training process, where after filtering the poisoned data, it re-trains the entire network and, as such, has less effect on the benign accuracy. These ambiguities in the presence of the past literature has led the paper to claim in Table 1 that it is the only work that doesn't require clean data AND doesn't do unlearning AND uses the natural training. There are other works within the literature that satisfy this criteria. For example, see [2-4].\n\n- There are several major issues with the current method:\n\n   1. The paper emphasizes over and over about the relationship of the backdoor triggers with a low-rank space. For instance, it reads: \"_One plausible explanation for this observation is the limited effective subspace associated with the trigger. This suggests that the trigger features are distributed in a low-dimensional subspace._\" However, these explanations are just a restatement of the actual method used in the paper, not based on step-by-step intuitive reasonings. I highly encourage the authors to re-write these statements and try not to rely on the observations in the figures but on the intuitions and explain why this method should work.\n\n   2. More importantly, the observations made in Figure 2, the explanation of the paper about this figure, and the actual methodology seem different. In particular, after plotting the t-SNE of different singular values in Figure 2, the paper says: \"_However, from the middle t-SNE figure, one can see that the pink dots represent backdoor images distributed uniformly in the space and overlap with other color dots. Thereby, the network cannot classify these samples as trigger classes since they are similar to samples belonging to different natural classes._\" So, from this explanation it seems that the natural way of dealing with backdoors is to remove the dominant singular values. However, as shown in Algorithm 1 in the Spectral Filter, the proposed method actually preserves those singular values and dampens the effects of the remaining ones. Perhaps there is a misunderstanding here that needs to be resolved.\n\n  3. There are two important related works that this paper needs to discuss its relationship with them in more detail. First, the method of Spectral Signatures [1] also uses SVD in the feature space of neural nets to filter samples that are poisoned. Second, Collider [2] uses local intrinsic dimensionality (LID) to argue that backdoors reside in a locally high-dimension manifold. The current work argues that backdoors reside in a low-dimensional sub-space (even though it does it rather informally) and as such, it is vital to clarify its stance with prior work.\n\n  4. The theoretical contributions seem too abstract. In other words, it is unclear how the provided theory is supporting the proposed method, as having a set of segregated feature vectors for backdoored vs. clean data seems too artificial and not directly related to EigenGuard. Please re-write this section to make its connections with the proposed method clearer.\n\n- The experimental results are limited. The paper tests its approach against BadNets, Blend, SIG, and Clean Label attacks that are published before 2020s and declares that they are state-of-the-art. There are newer backdoor attacks that exist in the literature today, including but not limited to: Dynamic Attacks [6], WaNet [7], ISSBA [8], Refool [9], etc. The same also applies to the baseline defenses used in the paper, where many recent works, such as [1-4], are left out. To provide a comprehensive evaluation, incorporating all these newer baselines is necessary. Preferably, large-scale experiments on ImageNet dataset is also needed.\n\n[1] Tran et al. \"Spectral signatures in backdoor attacks.\" _NeurIPS_, 2018.\n\n[2] Dolatabadi et al. \"Collider: A robust training framework for backdoor data.\" _ACCV_, 2022.\n\n[3] Hayase et al. \"Spectre: Defending against backdoor attacks using robust statistics.\" _ICML_, 2021.\n\n[4] Liu et al. \"Beating Backdoor Attack at Its Own Game.\" _ICCV_, 2023.\n\n[5] Huang et al. \"Distilling Cognitive Backdoor Patterns within an Image.\" _ICLR_, 2023.\n\n[6] Nguyen et al. \"Input-aware dynamic backdoor attack.\" _NeurIPS_, 2020.\n\n[7] Nguyen et al. \"Wanet\u2013imperceptible warping-based backdoor attack.\" _ICLR_, 2021.\n\n[8] Li et al. \"Invisible backdoor attack with sample-specific triggers.\" _ICCV_, 2021.\n\n[9] Liu et al. \"Reflection backdoor: A natural backdoor attack on deep neural networks.\" _ECCV_, 2020."

                        "value": "Thanks for your review, the following is our response.\n\n**1. About the claims in Table 1**\n\nWe need to claim that our method tries to train the neural networks in an end-to-end procedure. It is a challenging setting. The goal of our paper is to allow users to do end-to-end training without the concern of possible triggers in their datasets by just adding our module to their model.\n\nAlthough some methods like [1] which split the datasets and then naturally retrain the neural networks will also not influence the natural accuracy much, it is not a natural training way for neural networks. Such methods usually need a few different training stages, which is still a little complicated. Thereby, many users may still use the end-to-end training procedure instead of methods like [1]. To make it more clear, we also rewrite the tables.\n\n**2. About \u201cHowever, these explanations are just a restatement of the actual method used in the paper, not based on step-by-step intuitive reasonings. I highly encourage the authors to re-write these statements and try not to rely on the observations in the figures but on the intuitions and explain why this method should work.\u201d**\n\nOur method is proposed based on our findings on the features\u2019 eigenspace during training on different samples and tries to propose a new module to avoid such behaviors.\n\nFirst, we find that the trigger features can only concentrated in a low-rank subspace according to Figure 1 and Table 2. Then we find that trigger features are mainly distributed in the top singular space in Figure 2, which means the backdoor predictions are made because trigger features contribute a lot to the prediction due to their large singular value. \n\nDue to these findings, we propose our EigenGuard which damps the magnitude of trigger features while involving more natural features for prediction. Then we can defend against several backdoor attacks without any additional treatments during training. It\u2019s a natural finding to solution way for research.\n\n**3.About the \u201cinconsistency\u201c between Figure 2 and our method:**\n\nHere we only damp top eigenvalues instead of dropping them because $\\sigma_k$ is much smaller than $\\sigma_1$, which is consistent with our findings in Figure 2. From Figure 2(a), one can see that the trigger features are large enough to dominate the classification of backdoor samples, so making it smaller can decrease its impact. In other words, we try to average the backdoor features in Figure 2 (a) and (b) to make the backdoor samples hard to classify.\n\nThe reason why we not simply removing the top eigenvalues is such a method will make natural classes hard to classify as we can see in Figure 2(b) and lead to a huge drop in natural accuracy as listed in the following experiments on CIFAR-10 with BadNets:\n\n| Methods | ACC. | ASR. |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Remove top 10 Singulars  |  $85.4\\%$   |  $4.2\\%$   |\n| Ours | $92.6\\%$     |  $5.3\\%$   |\n\nAlso, as shown in Figure 4, the EigenGuard module can make the features perform as we wish.\n\n**4. About our methods\u2019 relationship with Spectral Signature and Local intrinsic dimensionality.**\n\nThere are two differences between ours and theirs:\n\n(1) Our method is a plug-in module for neural architectures, neural networks can naturally defend against some backdoor attacks with end-to-end natural training by inserting our EigenGuard model into the model\u2019s architecture. The other two methods only try to use the poisoned model's behavior to detect the trigger images and then try to purify the datasets to prevent backdoor attacks, which need complicated post-stage retraining stages.\n\n(2) Although both works analyze the feature behaviors, ours tries to detect the feature\u2019s spectral influence during training while others only analyze the model's feature behavior after training.\n\n**5. About the theory:**\nOur theory tries to demonstrate that damping the dominating trigger features will make the models use natural features to make correct predictions. It is also consistent with our method, we make the top singular values smaller to avoid the triggers dominating classifications."

About more evaluations:**\n\nWe also add some evaluations for our methods, we list some results below and you may find more results on the revision with SSBA[2], WaNet[3] attack and NAD[4], Spectral Signature defense using backdoor bench[6]\u2019s implementation on CIFAR-$10$ dataset due to the time limits. The results show that our method can perform well on different attacks. \n\nApart from that, we also noticed that the spectral signature cannot perform well under the backdoor bench\u2019s setting. The phenomenon may caused by its dataset split being parametric sensitive and the undetected few backdoor samples that are not detected can also lead to backdoor behavior in backdoor training, which also demonstrates that the detection and retraining defense methods are unstable.\n\n|                     | | Types             | None                 | FT                     | ANP                   | ***NAD***                    | ***SS***                    | ABL                   | EigenGuard            |\n|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| C10                 | ASR               | BadNets              | $100\\%$                | $3.0\\%$               | $0.5\\%$                | $6.7\\%$  | $99.7\\%$ | $3.1\\%$  | $5.3\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $100\\%$                | $10.2\\%$              | $0.5\\%$                | $3.8\\%$  | $100\\%$  | $15.2\\%$ | $0.4\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | CLB                  | $100\\%$                | $1.2\\%$               | $4.0\\%$                | $21.7\\%$ | $88.3\\%$ | $0.1\\%$ | $1.0\\%$              |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $94.2\\%$               | $0.4\\%$               | $0.3\\%$                | $6.8\\%$  | $89.1\\%$ | $0.01\\%$   | $2.8\\%$           |\n|                     |                   | ***WaNet***                | $92.3\\%$  | $15.1\\%$ | $1.7\\%$   | $28.9\\%$ | $90.1\\%$ | $2.3\\%$  | $8.8\\%$|\n|                     |                   | ***SSBA***                | $100\\%$   | $23.7\\%$ | $0.9\\%$   | $100\\%$  | $88.3\\%$ | $4.4\\%$  | $17.1\\%$|\n|                     | ACC               | BadNets              | $93.7\\%$               | $87.2\\%$              | $90.2\\%$        x       | $90.1\\%$ | $92.3\\%$ | $89.1\\%$  | $92.6\\%$             |\n|                     |                   | Blend                | $94.8\\%$               | $88.9\\%$              | $93.4\\%$               | $93.3\\%$ | $93.1\\%$ | $88.7\\%$  | $93.5\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | CLB                  | $93.8\\%$               | $91.9\\%$              | $92.7\\%$               | $91.8\\%$ | $92.4\\%$ | $89.3\\%$  | $93.3\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | SIG                  | $93.6\\%$               | $91.6\\%$              | $93.4\\%$               | $92.1\\%$ | $91.9\\%$ | $89.0\\%$  | $92.9\\%$            |\n|                     |                   | ***WaNet***                | $92.7\\%$  | $93.5\\%$ | $90.5\\%$  | $92.2\\%$ | $87.4\\%$ | $88.5\\%$ | $92.7\\%$|\n|                     |                   | ***SSBA***    | $92.8\\%$  | $89.7\\%$ | $88.7\\%$  | $92.3\\%$ | $71.5\\%$ | $85.6\\%$ | $93.1\\%$|\n\n[1] Spectral signatures in backdoor attacks.
