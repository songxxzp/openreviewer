                        "value": "> Page 3: What other notions of distance would it make sense to study?\n\nMore complicated distances such as optimal transport distance is an interesting future direction. Please see the future directions section.\n\n> Page 4: I do not understand the discussion before Theorem 1.4.\n\nThe discussion outlines our algorithmic strategy for smooth kernels. We obtain new private algorithms for them via a novel privacy preserving reduction to the other kernels for which we already know how to construct private data structures, such as Gaussians. For more details, please see our Technical Overview section (section 2).\nThe second part of the discussion states that our tools have additional advantages beyond privacy. They imply improved runtimes for kernel density estimation even in non-private settings.\n\n> Page 5: Why is it the case that Corollary 3.2 allows you to express 1/(1 + h(x, y)) in such a way?\n\nPlease see the proof of Theorem 3.3. At a high level, we can express the function $1/(1+z)$ as a sum of a small number of exponential functions $1/(1+z) \\approx \\sum_i \\exp(-w_i z)$ for explicit weights $w_i$. Then plugging in $h(x,y)$ for $z$ allows us to reduce KDE for the kernel $1/(1+h(x,y))$ to the KDE for $\\exp(-h(x,y))$.\n\n> Page 7: Second math display: I do not see why the last equality holds.\n\nBecause the $h(x,y)$ we consider are norms, such as $h(x,y) = \\|x-y\\|_2$, we can push any number which multiplies $h(x,y)$ outside to inside the norm expression. For example for any non-negative scalar $t$, $t \\cdot \\|x-y\\|_2 = \\| t \\cdot x - t \\cdot y\\|_2$.\n\n> Page 8: Could you please edit the caption of Figure 1 to be more detailed?\n\nThank you. We have updated the caption of the figure. \n\n> Page 9: I do not understand the comparison in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3 simply highlights that a DP classification pipeline based on our private distance queries can obtain $\\approx$ 85% accuracy using three orders of magnitude less time than prior state of the art methods."

The approach they rely on mainly is leveraging the low-dimensional structures behind specific functions, whilst utilising tools, like dimensionality reduction, approximation theory, and one-dimensional decomposition of functions. They provide both theoretical and empirical results on their findings, and show that they improve on the state-of-the-art solutions for these problems.\n\nTheir algorithm for the $\\ell_1$ distance function involves reduction to a series of one-dimensional decompositions.

For pure DP, this leads to some additional overhead factor in dimension due to composition when we combine the one-dimensional data structures for the full d-dimensional data structure. Any approach exploiting one-dimensional decompositions would likely have to pay some overhead for composition. Thus a completely new approach may be required. We note that the gap can be removed at the cost of approximate-DP. This is formally stated in Theorem B.4.\n\nWe remark that the naive way to perform composition leads to an $O(d)$ factor overhead for pure DP. However, we get an improved $O(\\sqrt{d})$ factor by exploiting the fact that the noise used in each dimension is independent; see the proof of Theorem B.3.\n\n> For the L1 distance queries, the error for eps=1 seems very large. It will always be the case that the error decreases with increasing eps, but in any case, it seems like this work may not be as useful in the high-privacy regimes.\n\nValues such as $\\epsilon \\ge 3$ are widely used in real world settings [1,2,3,4]. In this case, we already achieve < 0.1 relative error whereas prior SOTA does not give any meaningful empirical result (for *any* values of $\\epsilon$ tested). Theoretically in the 1-dimensional setting which our L1 experiments fall in, we have a tight matching lower bound stating that *any* DP algorithm *must* incur the same asymptotic additive error as our upper bound (see Theorem 1.2). Thus we find it unlikely that there exists an algorithm with significantly better empirical performance.\n\nWe would also like to highlight our other experimental results besides L1. For example, for private classification we can obtain 85% accuracy on a standard benchmark, whereas prior state of the art methods require **$> 10^3$** times more training time to obtain the same accuracy.\n\n[1] https://blog.research.google/2023/05/making-ml-models-differentially-private.html\n\n[2] https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/differential-privacy-for-census-data-explained\n\n[3] https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/ml-research/papers/learning-with-privacy-at-scale.pdf\n\n[4] https://desfontain.es/privacy/real-world-differential-privacy.html\n\n\n> Is there any specific reason, why you considered pure DP only, but not zCDP or approximate DP?\n\nWe used pure DP since it is a harder theoretical requirement than approximate DP. All of our results easily translate to the approximate DP setting to give better results. For example, Theorem B.4 in the submission states our approximate DP result for L1 queries which removes the $\\sqrt{d}$ factor. One can easily obtain similar improved results in the approximate DP setting for other queries by using Laplace noise in the places we have used Gaussian noise.\n\n> Might be worth citing this work https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00001.\n\nThank you for the reference. We have added it in the paper. We would like to point out that our novel dimensionality reduction results also imply faster KDE over prior SOTA even in the non-private setting; see Section G in the appendix."

In particular, the authors consider f to be distance functions such as $\\ell_p$ for $p = 1, 2,\\ldots,$  and also Kernel density estimates such as gaussian, exponential and Cauchy kernels. The approximation obtained is $\\alpha$-relative and also has an additive factor.\n\nIn comparison to prior work, for the case where f is the $\\ell_p$ norm, the relative error produced in this paper seems higher (from a relative approximation standpoint) but lower in terms of the additive error. For the KDE queries, the errors are similar to before but the parameters d and \\alpha in the query time of this result are decoupled. Finally, at least some of the results in this paper seems relatively simple leading to an implementation."

Our bounds allow us to trade off relative error and additive error by selecting $\\alpha$ (we can use any choice of $\\alpha$). If we let $\\alpha = d^{1/3}/(\\epsilon n)^{2/3}$ and use the fact that the *largest* possible L1 query value is at most $O(nd)$, our algorithm gives additive error $\\alpha \\cdot O(nd) + \\frac{d^{1.5}}{\\epsilon \\sqrt{\\alpha}} = O\\left( \\frac{d^{4/3}n^{1/3}}{\\epsilon^{2/3}}\\right)$ **which is always asymptotically better** than Huang et al (they have a larger dimension factor of $d^{7/3}$). Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that our algorithm gives much better empirical results than prior work. See Figure 2.  A similar statement holds for $\\ell_2$ queries. By parameterizing our final bounds using relative error, we can get even better guarantees than prior work when query values are small.\n\nNote that if the query values are smaller, which is natural, we get an even better additive error with no relative error. \n\nLastly, we remark that for $p > 2$, we obtain the first result for $\\ell_p^p$ queries as well as the first results for many smooth kernels such as $\\frac{1}{1 + \\|x-y\\|_2}$. There are no prior works to compare against for these new results.\n\n\n> In this sense, the result may be considered incremental. \n\nWe respectfully disagree with this assessment. Besides the improved additive error as discussed above, we introduce completely new tools in the design of private algorithms for computing similarities. Our tools have implications beyond private algorithms. For example, our dimensionality reduction results imply faster KDE queries even in the non-private setting.\n\n\n> technical insights (especially pertaining to privacy) in the main paper is somewhat limited.\n\nThank you for your feedback. For the final version, given more space, we will move additional technical content from the appendix.\n At the same time, we refer the reviewer to Section 2 of the main body which outlines how the techniques interact with privacy. For example, as stated in Section 2, our function approximation result crucially exploits the fact that smooth kernels can be written as a *small* number of exponential sums. This allows us to reduce private KDE for the kernel $\\frac{1}{1 + \\|x-y\\|_2}$ to private KDE for the kernel $e^{-\\|x-y\\|_2}$ without a blowup in the privacy parameters. We can then use existing private data structures for the kernel  $e^{-\\|x-y\\|_2}$. This reduction also works for other smooth kernels and is formalized in Theorem 3.3 in the main body."
