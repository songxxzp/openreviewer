The main result, for the matrix case, is that best rank-$k$ approximation error can be approximated to relative error $\\varepsilon$ using a bilinear compression $SAT \\in \\mathbb{R}^{O(k/\\varepsilon^2) \\times O(k/\\varepsilon^2)}$ of $A$ by two projection-cost-preserving sketches $S$ and $T$. The new result improves the dependence on $\\varepsilon$ from (Andoni and Nguyen, 2013); a new lower bound establishes the optimality of the current method."

                    "value": "As a work of _theoretical computer science_, this paper is perfectly adequate. As a work of _machine learning_, it has a few deficiencies.\n\n### Use Case\n\nWhen is the proposed method useful? The story the authors tell feels a bit farfetched to me:\n\n- Using a generalized Nystr\u00f6m approximation and OSNAP sketches, a rank-$k$ approximation can be computed in a single pass over the matrix. For a dense matrix stored on disk, the time cost is roughly $O(mn \\log k + (m+n) k^2)$; the cost of the proposed residual estimate is roughly $O(mn)$. The difference between these costs is not very significant, particularly if $k \\ll m,n$. \n- The authors suggest data streams as a potential application. Indeed, the proposed approach does give a way of estimating the residual error from a stream in low space. After which, the authors say one can use the residual estimate to decide whether or not low-rank approximation is worth it. But this raises two objections: 1) If one is going to compute a low-rank approximation anyways, then one will have to eat the space cost of storing such an approximation eventually. The proposed low-space diagnostic doesn't seem useful if, conditional on a positive outcome, actually computing the approximation needs more space. 2) Often in the streaming setting, we assume we get only a single pass over the data. The authors approach requires two passes: one to compute the diagnostic and a second to compute a low-rank approximation.\n\nIt may be possible that there is some use case where the proposed approach is natural, but it seems to me that the proposed method probably has fairly limited usefulness in practice.\n\n### CountSketch\n\nI find the author's use of CountSketch to be questionable, particularly in the numerical experiments. In my experience, an OSNAP (even with just 2 entries of sparsity per column) is dramatically more safe and effective than CountSketch in practice.\n\nTo demonstrate this, I ran my own experiment. Let $A = \\operatorname{diag}( i^{-6} : i=1,2,\\ldots,10^4)$ and, following Table 1, consider $m = 50$ and $k = 20$. With CountSketch, the estimate $\\| SAT - (SAT)_k \\|_F$ is a factor of **58** smaller than the true residual error $\\| A - A_k \\|_F$. By contrast, OSNAP with _just 2 nonzeros per column_ only underestimates the residual error by a factor of 2! For the proposed use case of screening whether or not significant compression is possible by low-rank approximation, an estimate within a factor of two is probably useful; one that is wrong by more than an order of magnitude is not.\n\nThis is a paper about theoretical computer science: Rigorous analysis of computational methods so that they work in practice even on worst-case inputs. The use of a plain CountSketch in the numerical experiments, now demonstrated to be able to severely underestimate the residual error in practice, should be removed in favor of the OSNAP or, perhaps, the composite CountSketch\u2013Gaussian sketch.\n\nAs a side note, the introduction claims that it will prove that the method works if $S$ and $T$ are chosen to be OSNAP's. But this is omitted from the main text. This should be included, because OSNAP's are often the most effective sketching matrices in practice.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe runtime of a full, dense SVD is not the appropriate comparison in Table 1. Rather, the appropriate comparison is a _randomized low-rank approximation_ such as the randomized SVD or generalized Nystr\u00f6m (with OSNAP's, if the latter).\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAs I mention above and as the authors tacitly admit with their numerical experiments, an error estimate which is within a factor of two is often sufficient, particularly if the proposed use case is determined whether or not to run a low-rank approximation algorithm. Viewed in this light, the improvement of the sketch dimension from $O(k/\\varepsilon^3)$ to $O(k/\\varepsilon^2)$ in the present work is not that meaningful in practice.\n\n### Sparse Approximation\n\nThe residual error for $k$-sparse approximation of vectors in $\\ell_p$ norms for $p > 2$ is very much a question of interest to theoretical computer science. I fail to see any interest for practical problems in machine learning.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nUltimately, I feel like this paper would be more at home at a dedicated TCS publication venue. I'm not sure when I would actually run the author's proposed method in practice, and the improvement from $O(k/\\varepsilon^3)$ to $O(k/\\varepsilon^2)$ has limited practical implications as well. I have significant concerns with the use of plain CountSketch in the numerical experiments. If the numerical experiments were fixed to avoid the use of plain CountSketch, I would be inclined to give a soft recommendation for acceptance."

                    "value": "### Is Lemma 3.2 correct?\n\nThe proof of Lemma 3.2 is not convincing to me in several ways. First, why does $d_{TV}(S(G), S(G+\\beta \\sqrt{\\varepsilon/k} \\cdot wz^\\top) \\le 1/10$ and $\\beta \\sqrt{\\varepsilon/k} \\cdot \\|w\\|\\|z\\|$ imply $d_{TV}(S(G), S(G + c\\alpha\\sqrt{\\varepsilon} \\cdot uv^\\top)) \\le 1/9$. I believe the ultimate result is probably true, but I don't following the line of reasoning.\n\nI'm not sure data processing and linearity of the sketch is enough to conclude that $d_{TV}(\\mathcal{L}_1,\\mathcal{L}_2)$. The perturbation $c\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}B$ is applied to both $G$ and $G + c\\alpha \\sqrt{\\varepsilon} uv^\\top$ and it is _dependent_ with the latter of these. I'm not sure exactly what the author's argument is. It appears that the authors are making a claim of the form:\n\n> If $d_{\\rm TV}(X,Y) \\le \\varepsilon$, then $d_{\\rm TV}(X+Z,Y+Z)\\le \\varepsilon$.\n\nThis claim is certainly not true. Let $X$ be a random variable which is never $0$ and take $X = -Y = Z$. Then $d_{\\rm TV}(X,Y) = 0$ but $d_{\\rm TV}(X+Z,Y+Z) = d_{\\rm TV}(2X,0) = 1$. \n\nI'm not sure how exactly the authors purport to conclude the proof of lemma 3.2. The authors should revise this proof to make unassailable the correctness of this result."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful and detailed comments. We have uploaded a new version of our submission, where we added OSNAP in Lemma 3.5 and replaced the CountSketch matrix with OSNAP in our experiments section.\n\n- The proof of Lemma 3.2: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have added more details to the proof of this lemma. Please check our new version of the submission. At a high level, here we have that $d_{TV}(X,Y)$ is small and wish to prove that $d_{TV}(X+Z,Y+Z)$ is small, where $Z$ is independent of $X$ but not of $Y$. In fact, we can show that $d_{TV}(X+Z,Y+Z) = d_{TV}(X,Y)$ is small when conditioned on a fixed $Z$ (the distribution of $Y$ depends on the choice of $Z$) over an overwhelming number of choices of $Z$. This is enough to conclude that the unconditioned value $d_{TV}(X+Z,Y+Z)$ is small.\n\n- The experiments: the reason we use a plain CountSketch matrix is that we found it has good performance for the two real-world datasets. We agree with the reviewer's point that OSNAP has a better worst-case guarantee. Hence, we have replaced CountSketch with ONSAP in our new version of the experiments. (Note that the new experiments are conducted on a different device, so the runtime is incomparable with that of the previous version.)\u00a0\n\n- On use cases: there are natural settings in which we do not necessarily need to compute a low-rank approximation of all of the input matrices $A_1, A_2, \\cdots, A_m$. Instead, we only need to compute an $\\alpha$-fraction of them, based on which of them has a good low-rank approximation. In the case when $\\alpha$ is small (such as $0.1$) and computing an actual low-rank approximation is much more expensive than estimating its cost, our algorithm will achieve a factor of roughly $\\alpha$ savings in its resource requirements. In the streaming model, the space we need for our algorithm is $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$, while if we want to compute a rank-$k$ approximation in a stream, the space we need would be $\\Omega((n + m) \\cdot k)$, which is larger than $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ when $k \\ll m, n$. Also, the overall runtime of our algorithm for our rank-$k$ residual estimation algorithm is $O(\\mathrm{nnz}(A) + \\mathrm{poly}(k))$, while for a rank-$k$ approximation, the overall runtime is $O(\\mathrm{nnz}(A) + (n + m) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k))$. Hence, if the matrix $A$ is sparse enough, the second term of $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ will save a factor of $n$ from the latter complexity of $(n + m) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(k)$. \nFor the $\\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem, when $p \\ge 2$, our algorithm is able to find heavy hitters that are even ``less heavy\" than those for $\\ell_2$, e.g., imagine a single coordinate $i^*$ has value $n^{1/3}$ while all other coordinates have value $1$. Then $i^*$ must be found by an $\\ell_3$ sparse recovery algorithm, but not by an $\\ell_2$ sparse recovery algorithm."

                        "value": "Thanks for clearing up the proof of Lemma 3.2; it's much clearer now. The integration of OSNAP into the text and the numerical experiments is an important improvement, in my eyes.\n\nUnfortunately, the more I look at the numerical experiments and the proposed use cases for the method, I become less convinced this will be a useful algorithmic technique in practice (see below).\n\nI understand the authors are coming from a theoretical computer science perspective. As a self-contained work of TCS and divorced from questions of whether the algorithmic problem being solved has practical use, I have no complaints about this work. To me, however, publication of a linear algebraic algorithm in ICLR requires the algorithm to be interesting and useful to practitioners with experiments that appropriately demonstrate its usefulness. My concerns about practical usefulness of the method have only grown the more I've looked into the method and played around with implementing it myself, so I have elected to lower my score.\n\n## Numerical experiments\n\nIn my original review, I encouraged the authors to use a randomized low-rank approximation algorithm\u2014rather than a full SVD\u2014as the baseline for the numerical comparisons in Table 1. As they have not adopted this suggestion in the most recent revision, I did some of my own experiments.\n\nAs a test, I generated a random matrix of size 3430 by 6906 and ran four algorithms: the author's method (with OSNAP s=2), Andoni\u2013Nguyen, the Halko\u2013Martinsson\u2013Tropp (HMT) randomized SVD, and a full SVD. I set $m=100$ and $k=10$. Here are the results:\n\n- 0.043 seconds for the author's proposal.\n- 0.071 seconds for Andoni\u2013Ngueyn.\n- 0.046 seconds for HMT.\n- 7.22 seconds for a full SVD.\n\nBut the author's mention that their matrix is sparse, possessing only 353,160 nonzeros. Using this sparsity and representing $A$ using a sparse matrix, I get the following timings:\n\n- 0.008 seconds for the author's proposal.\n- 0.012 seconds for Andoni\u2013Nguyen.\n- 0.003 seconds for HMT.\n- 7.31 seconds for a full SVD.\n\nActually computing a full low-rank approximation and the error of this low-rank approximation exactly using the formula $\\|A - \\hat{A}\\|_F^2 = \\|A\\|_F^2 - \\|\\hat{A}\\|_F^2$ for the HMT low-rank approximation $\\hat{A} = QQ^\\top A$ is over twice as fast as the proposal on a matrix with the same size and sparsity as in the author's own tests.\n\nOn the basis of these timings, I believe the author's numerical experiments\u2014as currently designed\u2014are misleading about the purported benefits of the proposed methodology.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n>  There are natural settings in which we do not necessarily need to compute a low-rank approximation of all of the input matrices . Instead, we only need to compute an $\\alpha$-fraction of them, based on which of them has a good low-rank approximation. In the case when $\\alpha$ is small (such as 0.1) and computing an actual low-rank approximation is much more expensive than estimating its cost, our algorithm will achieve a factor of roughly $\\alpha$ savings in its resource requirements.\n\nI have never encountered or heard of such a scenario occurring in practice. Do the authors have a reference for such a scenario in an applied context?\n\n> In the streaming model, the space we need for our algorithm is...\n\nI understand that your algorithm has lower space than computing a low-rank approximation. My question is _What use is a low-space algorithm for testing the residual error if, should the low-rank approximation error be small, you'll need higher-space to actually compute the low-rank approximation?_ If I only have $\\mathrm{poly}(k)$ space available to me, your algorithm isn't helpful to me. Sure, I can run your algorithm, but I lack enough space to actually do anything useful (i.e., compute a low-rank approximation) after a positive result from your algorithm.\n\nThe runtime benefits might be a different story, but, as I demonstrate above, your existing experiments don't support a big speedup over just running a randomized low-rank approximation algorithm. \n\n> For the $\\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem...\n\nAs a matter of mathematics, I agree with the authors that $\\ell_p$ heavy hitters can detect lighter heavy hitters than an $\\ell_2$ algorithm does. (This is a point that would be work making in the paper itself, to communicate the purported benefit of the proposed approach to a broad machine learning audience!) But noting that $\\ell_p$ heavy hitters can detect lighter heavy hitters, by itself, does not provide justification that the $\\ell_p$ residual estimation problem is of interest to machine learning. Does the proposed algorithm lead to concrete benefits on real data sets? Is super-constant space cost of $n^{1-2/p}$ acceptable in practice? To publish an algorithm for this problem in this venue, I think these \"applied\" questions deserve answers."

Is super-constant space cost of $n^{1-2/p}$\n acceptable in practice? \"\n \nNote that our algorithm indeed also outputs a vector $\\hat{x}$ which satisfies the requirements for the $\\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem, which was unknown for $p > 2$. We also provide a matching lower bound for the $\\ell_p$ recovery problem.  As mentioned, our algorithm for $\\ell_p$ is able to find heavy hitters that are even ``less heavy\" than those for $\\ell_2$, which is beneficial to, e.g., the standard Gaussian white noise model in practice for which the underlying vector is a sparse vector plus Gaussian noise (see. e.g., [WHXF11]), where now we can handle a smaller variance on the Gaussians. The ability to detect the existence of a large signal in compressed sensing is also useful, as we can decide to use more measurements only if we notice the existence of such a signal; otherwise we can use fewer. This would make the sensing adaptive, but this is also a common model in compressed sensing (see, e.g., [IPW12, MN13]).\n\n[CW13]: Kenneth L. Clarkson, David P. Woodruff.

I appreciate the authors for taking the time to thoughtfully respond to my (rather lengthy) reviews, and I believe that the changes made will make the method more robust if it sees use in practice (OSNAP rather than CountSketch) and will be more informative to practitioners about the speedups they can expect (randomized low-rank approximations as baselines).\n\nI have raised my score to its original level and wish the authors all the best."

                    "value": "This paper studies the problem of estimating the residual error using linear sketching. Specifically it focusses on the following two problems:\n\n1) For any matrix A, the task is to estimate $||A-A_k||_F$ within a $(1+\\epsilon)$-factor where $A_k$ is the best rank-k approximation to $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. For this problem, it is shown a bilinear sketch of the form $SAT$ where the sketching matrices $S \\in \\mathbb{R}^{O(k/\\epsilon^2) \\times n}$ and $T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times O(k/\\epsilon^2)}$ can be sparse countsketch matrices with a single $\\pm 1$ in their columns. This gives a sketch of size $O(k^2/\\epsilon^4)$. A lower bound is given which shows S and T must have $O(k/\\epsilon^2)$ rows and columns respectively for any algorithm which takes as input $S,T,SAT$ and outputs a $(1+\\epsilon)$ residual ran-k approximation. This shows the upper bound is tight for bilinear sketches.\n\n2) The next problem is estimating $\\| x-x_k\\|_p$ upto $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$ residual error for any vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ which is updated in the streaming model, for any $l_p$ norm with $p>2$ and where $x_k$ is the the vector containing the top-k elements of $x$. The algorithm uses countsketch to find the indices of top-k elements of $x$ approximately and parallely uses a known $F_p$ frequency estimation procedure for these coordinates and subtracts the approximate value of these coordinates to get the residual error. This yields an upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2p/(1-p)}k^{2/p} n^{1-2/p} )$ and also gives a $k$-sparse approximation for $x$. A lower bound of $\\Omega(k^{2/p} n^{1-2/p})$ is also shown for the $k$-sparse recovery problem.\n\nSome experiments are performed with the sparse sketching matrices."

Previous results for this problem used dense sketching matrices and had a larger upper bound of $O(k^2/\\epsilon^6)$ on the size of the sketch. The proof for the sketching algorithm is pretty straightforward from results on projection cost preserving sketches. The lower bound proof follow via minimum singular value separation results for random Gaussian matrices.\n\n2. For the residual vector norm recovery problem, the algorithm also outputs a $k-sparse$ approximation in $l_p$ norm which is optimal upto polylog $n$ factors (though the dependence on $\\epsilon$ is unclear). The lower bound proof follows from reducing the gap infinity problem to the $l_p$ sparse recovery problem.\n\n3. Though some of the results are pretty straightforward from prior results (for example, the bilinear sketch upper bound follows directly from the PCP sketch properties), they are an interesting addition to the sketching literature.\n\n4.

It seems we should have $(I \\cap J) \\cup T_1 \\cup \\ldots T_{m+1} \\subseteq I$ instead of exactly being equal to $I$ as it could happen that $i \\in I \\backslash J$ and  $x_i > || x_{-k}||_p $  in which case $i$ wouldn't belong to any of \n\nthe sets $ T_1, \\ldots T_{m+1}$? It seems instead of decomposing I, decomposing J as $ J= (I \\cap J) \\cup T_1 \\cup \\ldots T_{m+1}$ where each $T_i$ constains elements of $J$ not in $I$ in the given interval and then doing the analysis should given the same result?\n\nRemark: I have not checked whether Lemma 5.2 of Price and Woodruff, 2011 indeed generalizes to p>2. This is used in Lemma 4.10."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful and detailed comments. We have fixed the typos mentioned and uploaded a new version of the paper. We agree that there is still a bit of a gap between the bounds for the sparse recovery and residual norm estimation problems we study in this paper, and we treat this as an interesting future direction.\n\n- Question 1: Note that the size of $SAT$ is different from that of $A_k$, so they are not comparable as matrices. We have shown though in Theorem 3.7 that the residual error of $SAT$ is a good approximation to the residual error of using $A_k$ for $A$. Note though that $SAT$ is a much smaller sketch of $A$ and so gives a low memory way of approximating the residual that one could have found by using $A_k$. Also, in the low-rank approximation problem, using matrices $SA, AR, SAT$, we can more efficiently (than computing $A_k$ directly) compute two matrices $U$ and $V$ such that\n$\n||A - UV||_F^2 \\le (1 + \\epsilon)||A - A_k||_F^2 \\;.\n$\n(See the survey [1] for more details.)\n\n- Question 2: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In fact, one can show that $\\vert x_i\\vert ^p \\leq 2 \\Vert x_{-k}\\Vert_p^p$ for all $x_i \\in I \\setminus J$. Defining a new magnitude level for coordinates between $\\Vert x_{-k} \\Vert_p^p$ and $2\\Vert x_{-k} \\Vert_p^p$ is enough and the remainder of the proof is almost the same. The updated proof has been included in the new version which we have uploaded.\n\n[1] David P. Woodruff. Sketching as a Tool for Numerical Linear Algebra."

For the matrix case (Frobenius norm), the main result is a bilinear sketch of size $O(k^2/\\epsilon^4)$ by combining the count sketch and JL sketch; this improves upon the previous best result $O(k^2/\\epsilon^6)$ [Andoni-Nguyen, SODA'13]. The authors also provide a matching lower bound. For the $k$-sparse recovery under $\\ell_p$ norm for $p>2$, the author show an upper bound of $\\tilde{O}(k^{2/p}n^{1-2/p}$. This is done by two sketches, where one is used to find heavy hitters, and another to do a $F_p$ estimation."

In our work, we give a very different analysis than that in Andoni and Nguyen, and instead directly show that any sketching matrix with the so-called projection cost-preserving (PCP) property suffices, which allows us to directly use extremely sparse sketching matrices with a much faster running time, and also allows us to improve the bound to $O(k^2/\\epsilon^4)$ using advances in PCPs. We also show an $\\Omega(k^2/\\epsilon^4)$ lower bound, which shows that our upper bound is optimal up to a constant factor.\n\n- For the $\\ell_p$ sparse recovery problem, when $p \\ge 2$, our algorithm is able to find heavy hitters that are even ``less heavy\" than those for $\\ell_2$, e.g., imagine a single coordinate $i^*$ has value $n^{1/3}$ while all other coordinates have value $1$. Then $i^*$ must be found by an $\\ell_3$ sparse recovery algorithm, but not by an $\\ell_2$ sparse recovery algorithm."
