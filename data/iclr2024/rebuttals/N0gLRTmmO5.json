                    "value": "My main concern is the quality of the writing. I had trouble understanding the main ideas of the paper, mainly because there were many confusing definitions and notational jumps. Here are some concerns, in no particular order.\n\n1. In 2.1, the definition of a \"game\" seems to be a complete-information, alternating-move sequential game. But the paper is general to incomplete-information or simultaneous-move settings as well, so I think that the definition of game should be changed to accomodate that. In fact, since the paper doesn't care about the sequentiality at all, why not just use normal-form games throughout?\n\n1. The citation of [Farina et al 2020, Marris et al 2022] for correlated equilibrium is strange---especially the former, as the concept it discusses isn't CE. For CE I believe the correct citation is [Aumann 1974].\n\n1. The definition of $\\epsilon$-CE used here is a bit strange. Indeed, it seems to imply that the uniform-random policy is a $1/N$-CE, where $N = \\min_i |\\Pi_i|$ (which could be very large), and that not every $\\epsilon$-CE is an $\\epsilon$-CCE. Perhaps it would be better to define $\\epsilon$-CE with the set of swap deviations instead of the set of internal deviations (see e.g. [Blum & Mansour 2007]). But also this doesn't seem to matter much to the rest of the paper, so I mostly disregard it.\n\n1. In the diversity metric definitions (3) and (4):\n\n    a. the metric seems to depend on the ordering in which the profiles are added (i.e., on which strategy is the new one). Perhaps then the diversity metric should be expressed as a two-argument function, $\\text{Div}(\\Pi_i, \\pi_i')$, so that this dependence is clear.\n\n    b. The definition of occupancy measure should be stated in the text. \n    \n    c. Since Nash equilibria are not generally unique, (4) is not well-defined until a specific NE is selected. This should be explicitly stated and discussed.\n    \n    d. It is unclear how the definition $\\text{Div}(\\cdot)$ relates to the function $f(\\cdot)$ used later in the paper. In particular, it appears as if the diversity metric $\\text{Div}(\\cdot)$ is built to affect how *new policies* are introduced (i.e. to affect the best-response oracle, which is the thing picking the $pi_i'$), whereas the rest of the paper concerns the meta-solver. How are these related? This to me is a crucial point, because $f$ is used liberally in the remainder of the paper.\n    \nThe experimental evaluation is also not very convincing. On the single example in which the authors do a comprehensive test against other metrics, the proposed method, which is a combination of two prior methods, performs second-worst, being outperformed by both of the prior methods individually. \n\nA Blum & Y Mansour. \"From External to Internal Regret\", JMLR 2007"

                        "value": "Thank you for the reviewer's suggestions. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss the theoretical details with the reviewer.\n\n>(from 4(d) above) How does the definition Div(\u22c5) relate to the function f(\u22c5) used later in the paper?\n\nI apologize for any confusion in our explanation at this point. The meanings of $\\text{Div}(\u22c5)$ and $\\textbf{f}(\u22c5)$ are indeed consistent. The difference lies in the usage: $\\text{Div}(\u22c5)$ is employed in the algorithm's pseudocode to represent the matrix formed by the diversities of all policies for all players, while $\\textbf{f}(\u22c5)$ is used in the equilibrium definition, signifying that diversity is a function with policies as variables.\n\n>For Prop 3.1, what's an \"elementary matrix\"? I\u2212\\kappa ff^\\top does not seem to satisfy the definition I am familiar with.\n\nIn some books about matrix theory, elementary matrices are defined as follows: The general form of an elementary matrix is given by $E(u, v, \\kappa)=I-\\kappa uv^\\top$, where $u,v\\in C^n$ and $\\kappa\\in C$. All elementary transformations can be represented in the form of $E(u, v, \\kappa)$. Upon further investigation, we found that a more widely accepted definition for such matrices is \"rank-one update,\" i.e., $E(u, v, \\kappa)$ is a rank-one update of the identity matrix $I$. We will correct this definition in the paper.\n\n>Why is it \"unrealistic\" to solve (7-9)? If the game has a manageable size, it's is just a convex program.\n\nThank you for the clarification. Our expression here was a bit imprecise. What we intended to convey is that in most scenarios, directly solving equations (7-9) is not practical. Therefore, in convex optimization literature, it is common to transform the problem into solving the Lagrangian function. Typically, the size of the game can be manageable, but the size of the population may not be. Of course, in the case of toy games, the problem can be solved directly.\n\n>Doesn't Theorem 3.4 actually hold for all $\\epsilon>0$?\n\nYes, Theorem 3.4 actually holds for all $\\epsilon>0$. We provide an explanation for this in the appendix. Recalling the optimization objective $\u2212\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^\\top(I \u2212 \\kappa \\textbf{f}\\textbf{f}^\\top)\\sigma$, it is obvious that when $\\sigma=b$, the optimization objective reaches its maximum value. Additionally, $\\sigma$ must satisfy the linear constraint $A\\sigma\\leq\\epsilon$. Therefore, if $\\max(Ab) > \\epsilon$, then $\\sigma$ cannot be uniform. On the contrary, when $\\max(Ab) \\leq\\epsilon$, a uniform solution $b$ must exist."

I am clearly also not the only reviewer with these concerns. I would advise a major revision in which the authors take into account the clarity concerns from myself and the other reviewers, in order for the main ideas of the paper to be more understandable. I will maintain my score.\n\nIf Div and f are the same function, the same notation should be used for both. That would be far less confusing.\n\nThe definition that I know for \"elementary matrix\" is that an elementary matrix is one that is created by performing a single elementary row operation (switching, multiplication, or addition of rows) on the identity matrix. The difference in definition should be clarified.\n\nOn (7-9), if I understand correctly, that equation is only ever being solved over the meta-game. The meta-game will be a very small normal-form game, in which case (7-9) is a convex program of reasonably small size, which is probably realistically solvable. I would advise that the authors try a generic off-the-shelf convex optimizer (such as Gurobi) to solve (7-9)."

Could they define this precisely?\n\nAs mentioned in the common response, some diversity definitions focus on the difference between an individual policy and all other policies within the population. Therefore, \"the isolation diversity\" refers to the scenario where we adhere to this definition and calculate diversity only for a specific policy within the population, without computing the diversity for all policies. This isolated diversity can only reflect the differences between the corresponding policy and all other policies in the population, failing to capture the overall diversity of the entire population. Hence, it is meaningless. We appreciate your suggestion, and we do acknowledge the need to provide an explanation for these points in the paper.\n\n>Why is NE not included as a baseline meta-strategy solver?\n\nFor multi-player games, Nash Equilibrium (NE) is not unique, and its computational cost is substantial. Therefore, it is not suitable as a baseline meta-strategy solver, which is why JPSRO utilizes (C)CE instead of NE. However, in the case of 2-player games, the reviewer's suggestion is reasonable, and indeed, we should consider NE as a baseline meta-strategy solver for 2-player games.\n\n>How does the ablation study perform on the other games?\n\nWe will supplement the ablation study performed on the other games in our paper.\n\n>\"Given that diversity has the ... and being computationally tractable.\" Diversity is not generally guaranteed to be tractable.\n\nTo our knowledge, diversity is commonly defined in computationally tractable forms, such as vector norms, matrix norms, and distribution divergences.\n\n>How do the methods compare if you're interested in finding an equilibrium as opposed to the maximum welfare equilibrium?\n\nIn game theory, there is a widespread interest in equilibria that maximize the total payoff for all players, known as the maximum welfare equilibrium. This represents one of the fundamental questions in game theory research. Therefore, in our work, we have also chosen the maximum welfare equilibrium as an evaluation metric, as it provides an objective measure for assessing outcomes.\n\n>Some of the citations are confusing, for example Correlated Equilibrium is credited by two papers that came out after 2020.\n\nThank you for your suggestion. We will correct this section accordingly."

Unfortunately, my main concern is still unresolved for myself and my fellow reviewers: the motivation and justification of the primary hypothesis are insufficient. For this reason, my overall evaluation of the manuscript remains largely unchanged. Specific comments and questions follow.\n\n\n> \u00a0Therefore, a reasonable approach is to provide greater sampling opportunities for opponent policies that are farther from the population (i.e., more diverse), which can avoid repeatedly facing similar opponent policies in different training rounds, thereby enhancing the adaptability of policies more quickly. However, currently, no work has considered this aspect.\n\nI don't think it's fair to claim that increasing the probability of sampling diverse coplayers is novel to this work. One such direct example is Rectified Nash, but I would make arguments that FictiousPlay, History-Aware Double Oracle, Mixed-Opponents, NeuPL, etc. all do this in essence. \n\n\n> We will supplement the ablation study performed on the other games in our paper.\n\nI'm glad to hear that additional analysis will be conducted. These should greatly aide the quality of the manuscript.\n\n\n> To our knowledge, diversity is commonly defined in computationally tractable forms, such as vector norms, matrix norms, and distribution divergences.\n\nI think this is only a fair claim to make for response-diversity terms. Computing state-action occupancy distributions for a policy can be computationally intractable, generally. \n\n\n> Therefore, in our work, we have also chosen the maximum welfare equilibrium as an evaluation metric\n\nI agree that this is a fine definition of equilibrium and a reasonable one to choose (especially since it resolves the selection problem). However, the premise of the paper is more general than this claim. I would suggest refining the scope of the paper throughout if the goal is only MW(C)CE, or suggest studying (C)CE generally."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "In its current state, this paper is not ready for publication. Most of the issues are in the writing of the paper. In my reading, I was unable to find explanations for key parts of the algorithm. There are also some minor issues: it's not intuitive to me why the definition of diversity expectation would be good, which would be fine if the experiments convincingly showed that the algorithm is good, but they don't. (Maybe the definition of diversity expectation is a good one, but the paper didn't show me that it is.)\n\n- The algorithm is not clearly explained: I feel like this paper is missing a paragraph or a section, because Section 4 and Algorithm 1 should explicate the algorithm. However, to my reading, they do not. The paper does not explain what MS is, which is the most important part of the paper. (Without stating the specific choice of MS, Algorithm 1 seems to be equivalent to PSRO.) I infer that MS does the computation described in Section 3.3, but this does not seem to be explicitly stated anywhere! And even if I make this inference, I don't know whether it is Equation 14 (General support) or Equation 15 (Full support) which is being calculated. The paper also does not explain what DM is, although I infer that it is the diversity measure from Equation 6.\n\n- However, this also seems undefined! Section 3.1 explains how sum of diversity expectations is calculated based on each player's diversity measure $f_{i|l,m,...q}$, which is defiend in terms of $f$. However, as far as I can see, the choice of $f$ used in the experiments was never described! (I cannot even infer the choice of $f$, since Section 2.4 describes two different diversity measures, and states that this work uses a combination of them, with the method of combination left undefined.)\n\n- Presumably the output of DCO is supposed to be a D(C)CE, but this is never stated. It should be stated. It should also be stated and proved that the termination condition given in Algorithm 1 leads to the output being a D(C)CE.\n\n- I don't entirely understand the sentence in Section 3.1: \"Inspired by JPSRO, we use a quadratic function as the optimization objective\". If my interpretation is correct, JPSRO uses the Gini impurity as an objective, which is quadratic. Here, I don't see why you would be inspired to maximize $(f^\\top \\sigma)^2$ -- aren't both of those vectors non-negative, so maximizing their square is equivalent to maximizing the original thing?\n\n- It's stated in Section 3.1 (and throughout the paper) that \"our objective it to increase the sampling probability assigned to diverse policies. This is achieved by maximizing the sum of each player's policy diversity expectations, thereby ensuring that the more exploratory policies play a more significant role in approximating the full game (C)CE.\" I don't immediately see why this objective is achieved by maximizing the sum of each player's policy diversity expectations. Maybe I am misunderstanding, but as defined, it seems that each $f_{i|l,m,...q}$ is dependent on the set of player $i$ policies, but is not dependent on their distribution over those policies. It would be helpful for the paper to explain or give intuition for why the policy diversity expectations achieve this goal.\n\n- On that note, it would be good for the paper to include qualitative examples of things like the policy diversity expectation value for different strategy profiles, and especially for the difference in distributions over a given set of strategy profiles for D(C)CE vs. MG(C)CE.\n\n- Results are not convincingly strong. Only in 3-Player Kuhn Poker is the novel method clearly better. 2 of the 3 experiment games are 2-player, not multi-player.\n\nMinor:\n- the first paragraph of Section 3 mentions \"MGCE\" but this is not defined anywhere.\n- Game notation (Section 2.1) could use work. Probably should clarify in the first sentence that this describes sequential games. Policies are not defined. State transitions are not defined. In the description of meta-game, should it say that \"a meta-strategy is used to denote the probability distribution over policy *profiles*\" instead of \"over policies\"? And perhaps a more suitable name for \"meta-strategy\" would be \"joint meta-strategy\"?\n- Notation in Section 2.2 could also be more clear. It could be specified what the summation in Inequality (1) is over. Sigma is defined in 2.1 using brackets but is used in 2.2 with parentheses. Underneath it says it can be written as $A_i \\sigma$ but neither of those symbols are defined (it is not explicated anywhere that they are vectors). I would appreciate a citation for the statement that the maximum sum of social welfare under CEs is greater than or equal to that under NEs. Should it say that \"The NE *are* located on the boundary\" instead of \"The NE *is* located on the boundary\"? In the definition for NE, the symbol $\\sigma(\\pi_i)$ is used, and although it's clear to someone familiar with the topic what this means, it's not defined anywhere and could be confusing for some readers. In the definition for CCE, should it say \"only consider deviating *before*\" instead of \"only consider deviating *until*\"? Also, this \"recommended policy\" is referenced to define CCEs, but is not previously mentioned in the definition of CEs, so the reader doesn't know what a \"recommended policy\" is. For the definition of CCEs (inequality 2), the foralls should be clearly restated instead of implied, otherwise the definition of $i$ is not clear.\n- Section 2.3 uses the term \"Meta-Solver (MS)\" but doesn't describe what it is or give any examples (e.g. Nash Equilibrium solver). The symbol $u^*_i$ is used but not defined anywhere.\n- Section 3.2 is titled \"Existence of the Equilibrium\" but it seems to me to concern the uniqueness of the equilibrium and not the existence of the equilibrium. \n- Section 4: \"it differs from other algorithms by assigning greater sampling probabilities to more diverse policies\": could this be made more precise or expanded upon? What is a \"more diverse policy\"? When does it assign greater sampling probability? (in the meta-solver?) \n- Section 6: The sentence \"In [multi-player general-sum games], players aim not only to coordinate their policies or actions within a unified join policy but also seek to maximize overall social welfare\" seems wrong to me. That may be the players' goal, or it may be the algorithm designer's goal, but generally players just care about their own utility, right? Unless the setting is intended to be fully cooperative.\n\n\nNitpicks / typos:\n\n- Abstract: \"The primary in this work\"\n- Introduction: \"frameowrk\"\n- Quotation marks in Section 2.1 are both in the same direction for \"game of games\"\n- Section 2.1: \"used to denoted\" should be \"used to denote\"\n- Section 2.2: it's weird that the original Aumann paper is not cited here for the definition of CE (I know it was cited earlier, in the Introduction, but should it be cited here?)\n- Section 2.4: Perhaps rearrange the first sentence so it says \"... the diversity of player $i$'s population $\\Pi_i ...$, given the opponent's policy $\\pi^l_{-i}$  is denoted by ...\" to emphasize that the diversity is of a population and conditional on an opponent's policy?\n- Section 3: grammar - \"The sampling probability of the policy is closer to the uniform distribution, the entropy or Gini impurity is larger.\" Also, the \"sampling probability of a policy\" is referred to a few times but as far as I can tell it's not precisely defined what it means.\n- Section 3: should \"regular term\" be \"regularization term\"? This would also benefit from a quick explanation of \"policy exploitability (PE)\"\n- should \"the corresponding expected return (ER)\" be \"the corresponding expected returns (ER)\"?\n- Section 5 (page 8): \"the weight K of the diversity term should be smaller than ...\" the fraction has a typo?\n- Figure 1 x-axis should be \"Iterations\" not \"Itertions\""

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and are glad to discuss the suggested interesting work. We apologize for the fact that we use some notations and concepts that are implicitly defined by context, and we have elaborated on them in the paper.\n\n>The explanation of the metrics and equilibrium concept and algorithm implies that they can be used for both correlated as well as coarse correlated equilibria. However, the experiments seem to all use CCE versions and measure the CCE gap. Can the experiments be performed for CE as well?\n\nThe experiments be performed for CE, but the computational cost of CE is significantly higher than that of CCE (Correlated Equilibrium with Diversity). Due to time constraints, we did not present experimental results for CE in the paper. However, we will take your suggestion seriously and supplement this part of experimental results.\n\n>Throughout the text, it's stated that we want to assign higher sampling probabilities to \"more diverse policies\". But what does it mean for a policy to be \"more diverse\" than another? Isn't diversity defined for a set of policies, not for an individual policy?\n\nYes, diversity is usually defined for a set of policies. However, as I mentioned in the common response, some diversity measures define the difference between an individual policy and the other policies in the population. These definitions can be used to assess whether one policy is more diverse than another. Here, we want to convey that if a policy $\\pi_a$ is more diverse than another policy $\\pi_b$, then its difference from the entire population is larger than the difference of $\\pi_b$ from the entire population.\n\n>I don't understand the (C)CE in Equation 8. When this is for CCE, what is $A_i$?\n\nFor CCE, the definition of A_i is given by $A_i(\\pi^\u2032_i , \\pi) = u_i(\\pi^\u2032_i , \\pi_{\u2212i}) \u2212 u_i(\\pi)$, and detailed information is provided in Section 2.2.\n\n>Section 3.2 says that \"calculating entropy can be challenging\" -- why is that? Isn't it just $O(|N|\u00d7|\\Pi|)$ where $|\\Pi|$ is the size of each player's population?\n\nSorry, we should be more rigorous here. What we want to express is that compared to Gini impurity, which is a quadratic function, the calculation of entropy involves a logarithmic function, which will become slower when frequent calculations are performed in large games.\n\n>Section 5 says \"the CCE Gap, which is evaluated under Maximum Welfare CCE\". What does it mean that it is evaluated under Maximum Welfare CCE? (What part of the definition is Maximum Welfare CCE specific?)\n\nThe evaluation of the gap needs to be conducted under the meta-distribution, and it is unreasonable to assess it using the same distribution as itself. Therefore, we need to evaluate the gap between the DCCE we obtained and the target equilibrium under a more objective distribution. MW(C)CE is a reasonable choice because it maximizes the total payoff for all participants and is an easily computable linear formulation (Marris et al., 2021). Thank you for your suggestion, and we should include the relevant definition of MW(C)CE in the paper.\n\n>First-price Sealed-bid Auction (FPSBA) is described as a multi-player game. This paper is about multi-player games. Then why is the experiment only in a 2-player FPSBA?\n\nThank you for your reminder. Indeed, we should provide the experimental results for 3-player FPSBA. Due to the increased complexity of 3-player FPSBA and the need for additional time resources, these results were not included in our paper. We will supplement the relevant experiments.\n\n>Blotto is a 2-player zero-sum game. Can we compare to normal PSRO with a Nash Equilibrium meta-solver?\n\nYes, your suggestion is valid. We should indeed compare with normal PSRO using a Nash Equilibrium meta-solver. At that time, our focus was primarily on meta-solvers suitable for multiplayer games, and we overlooked the normal Nash Equilibrium meta-solver.\n\n### Reference\n[1] Luke Marris, Paul Muller, Marc Lanctot, Karl Tuyls, and Thore Graepel.

The paper shows that under some tuning of internal parameters the uniqueness of the resulting solution concept follows and presents some closed formed descriptions of the solutions. Experimental results showcase that in some games the resulting solver can outperform previous solvers when the internal parameters are  \"selected appropriate through extensive hyper-parameter tuning\"."

First, I would expect the experimental results to actually showcase and discuss the actual diversity of the found solutions but this is surprisingly not really explored. Instead the paper only focuses on the extent in which these new techniques find states of low exploitability. I find this to be a critical weakness of the paper and I would be very interested in a deeper dive that tries to explore what are the properties of the solutions found and not whether they are epsilon equilibria for small enough epsilon. \n\nEven the current experimental implementation leaves something to be desired. For example, it is stated that the stated performance of the technique is for a choice of internal parameters which is \"selected appropriate through extensive hyper-parameter tuning\". Is this an apple to apple comparison with other techniques?\n\nThe theoretical analysis of the paper is not particularly deep. Finally, the paper showcases some obvious typos or undefined notations that indicate a bit of rushed implementations.\nExamples include:\nPage 3. \\Pi^{O:T}_{-i} from Marris et al paper not defined.\nPage 4. In Equation 4 \\rho is not defined.\nPage 8 In all figures Itertions-> Iterations."

So it is not clear to me whether the success of low exploitability is really due to optimizing for diversity.\n\nAlso in terms of an apple to apple comparisons to other techniques did you try to examine what would happen if a similar fine-tuning was explored for the other competing techniques?"

We are glad that the reviewer considers the proposed method and the experiments here interesting.\n\n>Can you be a bit more precise about the hyper-parameter tuning process of $\\kappa$? For example when it is very small (which you need to be small enough to guarantee uniqueness) then the solution you find is not optimizing for diversity but for maximizing the convex objective $\\sigma^\\top\\sigma$. So it is not clear to me whether the success of low exploitability is really due to optimizing for diversity.\n\nThe optimization objective of MG(C)CE is $\\sigma^\\top\\sigma$, and it can be viewed as a scenario of D(C)CE when $\\kappa$ is very small. The experimental results of MGCCE have been demonstrated in Figure 1, providing a comparison with the results of DCCE.\n\n>Also in terms of an apple to apple comparisons to other techniques did you try to examine what would happen if a similar fine-tuning was explored for the other competing techniques?\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is currently no technology similar to ours. That is, no one has employed the diversity measure to define an equilibrium in a manner similar to our approach. The baselines we use also do not involve such operations. Therefore, it is challenging to conduct similar fine-tuning for other technologies at this point."
