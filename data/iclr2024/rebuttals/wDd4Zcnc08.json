                        "value": "We appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to evaluating our manuscript. We are grateful for your insightful comments, which we believe have contributed significantly to the refinement of our work. Below, we provide responses to your comments and address the concerns.\n\n> Reviewer\u2019s Question: Does the curated dataset provide atom coordinates?\n\nThanks for the question. We would like to clarify that our dataset does not include atom coordinates. The decision to curate a dataset with pure experimentally collected perovskite data was made to avoid bias introduced by different DFT-calculated results. Experimental datasets typically lack atom coordinates due to the difficulty of experimentally characterizing them. We will ensure this is explicitly mentioned in the revised manuscript. \n\n> Reviewer\u2019s Question: Why do authors follow classic ML methods to do structure-agnostic prediction? Currently, 3D structures are commonly considered by GNN methods developed to predict material properties. I don\u2019t think \u201caiming to apply our model for analyzing large scale materials and discovering novel materials\u201d and \u201cusing 3D structure\u201d are contradictory. If the dataset contains material structures, and the proposed method can outperform SOTA methods like CGCNN (using structure). Then, it\u2019s an exciting result.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of 3D structures and emphasize that our intention is not to dismiss their relevance. However, 3D structure data, i.e., atom coordinates, are generally not available for novel materials designed conceptually in large-scale materials screening. Material scientists have two approaches to obtain structure data for a novel material. The first is to carefully synthesize and characterize the material experimentally with sophisticated equipment. However, this approach is impractical when screening materials from a pool of millions of candidates. The second approach is to calculate atom positions with DFT by determining the most stable positions, which is how most 3D structure data are obtained in materials datasets that are used extensively by GNN methods.\n\nNevertheless, these calculations are computationally expensive, especially for large crystal super-lattices. For example, in our case, when the perovskite ABX3 is doped with a low concentration of organic cations A\u2019, A\u2019_0.02A_0.98BX3, to represent these low concentrations in atoms with coordinates, thousands of atoms in the super-lattice may be needed, requiring a supercomputer cluster to solve. Hence, we assert that using a 3D structure in large-scale material screening is not feasible, particularly in our case.\n\nWhile we agree that it would be exciting if the proposed structure-agnostic method could outperform state-of-the-art methods that use structure data, it is essential to recognize that structure data are indeed crucial in understanding materials' properties and adhering to physical laws (The comparison is included in the general reply for baselines). The contribution of our method lies in achieving accurate predictions without the explicit use of detailed structural information, thereby facilitating the model's application in large-scale novel materials screening and discoveries.\n\n> Reviewer\u2019s Question: An ablation study is needed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed edge design.\n\nWe appreciate the suggestion for an ablation study to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed edge design. In the revised manuscript, we will include an ablation study to provide a more in-depth analysis of the model components and their impact on performance. Most reviewers share the concern about the lack of an ablation study, so we posted the extended experiment results in a general reply. \n\n> Reviewer\u2019s Question: Does the curated dataset provide more property targets? It\u2019s encouraged to do experiments with more properties.\n\nWe agree with this suggestion and will conduct additional experiments on our dataset to explore predictions for multiple property targets. Since most reviewers share this concern, we will post a general reply with the results. We hope the extended experiments will address your concerns.\n\n> In the last equation in Sec 3.4, what are node weights $n_(i,j)$? Its definition is missing.\n\nThanks for the question. We are sorry for the ambiguity. The node weights $n_(i,j)$ are calculated by the fractions of the node's presence in the crystal as the source node $n_i$ \u2018s neighbor, which indicates how often the node will interact with the source node.  This metric is rescaled and added to the overall weight for a specific neighbor to evaluate its effect on the source node. We will include the definition in the revised manuscript."

                        "value": "> Graph Construction Details:\n\nThanks for your question. Yes, the constructed graph is fully connected, with edges representing the interactive information in the crystal calculated from the crystal symmetry and the chemical formula. We apologize for any confusion regarding the clarity of the graph construction details. In the revised manuscript, we will provide a more comprehensive explanation of the graph construction methodology, including a clearer presentation of the figures. \n\n> Regarding the Concerns About Significance and Generality:\n\nWe appreciate the attention to the significance and generality of our proposed method. We acknowledge that our approach focuses on a specific HOIPs system with the format ABX3. The reason we focused on this system, on the one hand, is that it has shown promising potential as a semiconductor material with applications in various fields. On the other hand, we identified that a more common issue of the missing structural data for conceptually designed novel materials has impeded the application of GNN models in real-case material screening. By designing the $HP^3-NS$ graph representations, we facilitated this process and validated the usage with real material synthesis and measurements. \n\nWhile we acknowledge that its extension to general cases may require further investigation, we believe the proposed method to construct nested graphs for hybrid crystalline materials systems and use the stoichiometry formula to construct the edges and models can be adapted to other hybrid or pure inorganic crystalline materials of interest. The $ABX_3$ constraint was actually some prior knowledge about the symmetry of the lattice that can be generalized to other lattice constraints. \n\n> Regarding the Concerns About Originality:\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's comments on the originality of our work. While we acknowledge that the idea of utilizing heterogeneous graphs has been applied in some works to address specific domain problems, we want to emphasize our unique contribution to dealing with hybrid systems in crystalline materials. Specifically, our edge design does not rely on structural data, addressing a significant challenge when handling complex systems with organic molecules where detailed information is often lacking.\nIn our approach, we have to constrain the model with certain symmetry knowledge of the lattice due to the absence of structural data. We initiated the graph construction by introducing a new edge design and nested graph inspired by the physical interactions in crystalline materials. The effectiveness of these proposed components has been demonstrated in the ablation study and benchmarking.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no similar structure-agnostic Graph Neural Network (GNN) work focused on modeling hybrid organic-inorganic systems. Moving forward, we plan to conduct more generalized and systematic work on refining and formalizing our model. We appreciate the valuable feedback provided and hope that our perspective on addressing the unique challenges in the representation of hybrid systems in crystalline materials is considered."

We are grateful for the constructive feedback and would like to address the concerns raised in the review.\n\n> Reviewer Comment: More baselines should be used and tested on more datasets.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of comprehensive evaluation and agree that including additional baselines and testing on diverse datasets can enhance the robustness of our proposed method. In response, we have expanded the set of baseline models in the revised manuscript. We have mainly chosen structure-agnostic methods as baselines, aligning with the nature of our problem. Furthermore, we have extended our experimentation to cover a more extensive range of datasets and material properties. We will provide a detailed discussion of baseline selection and result in a general reply to reviewers, as several raised similar concerns. We believe these additions will substantially address the raised concerns and provide a more thorough assessment of our methodology.\n\n> Reviewer Comment: More technical details should be included.\n\nThank you for your request for more technical details. Dealing with hybrid organic-inorganic material systems in the absence of structural data requires a meticulous approach. We carefully formulated the problem constraints, constructed material graphs, designed edges inspired by crystal lattice interactions, specified node details, selected and binned node features, and built subgraphs. Unlike models with structural data inputs, our approach indirectly incorporates lattice knowledge by differentiating intra-group and inter-group ratios (node weights). Our model design employed different Graph Neural Network (GNN) structures for the crystal graph and the nested subgraph, tailored to their respective purposes. The specific technical details are elucidated in dedicated sections within the Methods part of the revised manuscript.\n\nWe apologize for the ambiguity in how we formatted these technical details. In the revised manuscript, we will provide additional technical information, including a more in-depth description of the nested graph representation, training procedures, and any other relevant technical aspects in the appendix sections. Including the detailed parameters we used to train the models. This will ensure clarity and help readers better understand the methodology.\n\n> Reviewer Comment: More theoretical contributions should be made.\n\nWe recognize the importance of clearly articulating the theoretical contributions of our work. As an application work, we would like to emphasize our contribution to tackling the specific challenges posed by hybrid organic-inorganic crystalline materials in practical applications, where large-scale material candidates with complex doping levels are present but structural data are unavailable. As a generalization, we formulated the hybrid organic-inorganic crystalline material systems problem as graph property predictions given no structural information, which poses the problem of proper edge design and graph construction. The proposed edge design and nested graph construction were inspired by the actual interactions in crystalline lattices in materials, as our proposed contribution of graph design in hybrid materials representations. The $ABX_3$ constraint was actually another source of information injected inherently as pre-knowledge about the symmetry of the lattice."

Below, we provide a detailed response to each point:\n\n> Reviewer's Comments: The experiments are kind of inadequate, as the GNN baselines are too old and few (only 1 GNN...), and there are no ablation studies.\n\nWe appreciate your consideration and shared your concern regarding the adequacy of our experimental evaluation in the initial manuscript. Our primary objective in the initial submission was to showcase the application of $HP^3-NS$ in actual material property prediction and screenings. We realized the importance of providing a more comprehensive comparison with multiple baselines and conducting ablation studies to establish the superiority of our representation design.\n\nTaking your valuable advice into account, we have taken steps to address these concerns in the revised manuscript. The experimental section has been expanded to include additional state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) baselines that are particularly relevant to the hybrid perovskite prediction task. Furthermore, we have incorporated ablation studies to thoroughly analyze the impact of individual components of our proposed method on predictive performance.\n\n**Considering similar questions posed by other reviewers, we plan to present the results of these extended experiments in a general reply, ensuring that the insights gained are accessible to all reviewers**. We sincerely hope that these additional experiments will sufficiently address your concerns regarding the perceived limitations in our initial experimental setup. We are grateful for your guidance and look forward to your feedback on the revised manuscript.\n\n> Reviewer's Comments: Writing typos. The paper needs more careful proofreading.\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's feedback on the need for improved proofreading. We have carefully revised the manuscript to address all identified writing typos and to enhance overall clarity. We have also engaged professional proofreading services to ensure a higher standard of language and presentation. We are confident that these revisions significantly improve the readability and overall quality of the manuscript."
