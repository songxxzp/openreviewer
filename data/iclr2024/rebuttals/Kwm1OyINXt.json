                    "value": "This paper presents a probabilistic deep learning model designed to predict the 3D directions of elementary particles from point cloud data, specifically targeting the detection of dark matter. The primary challenge tackled is determining the initial directions of low-energy electrons. The architecture used is a sparse 3D convolutional neural network. The output is parameterized using a von Mises-Fisher distribution, as the directional outputs need to be constrained to the 2-sphere. When compared against a non-machine learning approach on a simulated dataset, the proposed model shows a significant improvement in mean cosine distance."

I also like the fact that the proposed approach uses both a probabilistic output for quantifying the uncertainty as well as doing on-manifold predictions.\n\nS2. Model Calibration: The paper shows that the model is well-calibrated on simulated data and can identify low-uncertainty samples, which is crucial for real-world applications. This ability to filter out ambiguous predictions is very useful for improving the accuracy and realiability which is important in science applications.\nThe comparison to a deterministic model trained with the cosine distance loss also demonstrates that the method performs well compared to the baseline.\n\nS3. Technical Depth: The method seems to be well thought out and goes into detail on computing the negative log-likelihood loss, and practical considerations for stable training."

Limited Comparison: While the paper compares the proposed method with a non-machine learning algorithm, it lacks a comprehensive comparison against other deep learning-based methods, especially those for predicting uncertainties on manifolds. See, for example [1] and the references therein.\n\nW2. Real-world Evaluation: The paper primarily relies on a simulated test set. Although simulations are valuable, as this is an application-focussed paper, it would be useful to also evaluate the model on real-world data, possibly obtained from actual detectors, to gauge its performance under realistic conditions.\n\nW4. Interest to the community: The paper is focussed on a very specific application and I'm not sure how relevent the method is to the ICLR community. Perhaps it would be better suited to a physics journal. Related to this, if the paper is aimed at the ICLR audience, then the introduction needs to be written in a way that clearly explains the problem and why it is important from an ML perspective.\n\n[1] Gilitschenski, Igor, et al. \"Deep orientation uncertainty learning based on a bingham loss.\" International conference on learning representations. 2019."

I would like the authors to explain why this method is relevant to the machine learning community and also give a better overview of why the problem is important (so that non-particle physiscists can understand its significance).\n\n2. The authors should also consider comparing their method with other machine learning or deep learning methods, if available, that also target on-manifold uncertainty predictions. This will help position the contribution better with respect to existing work.\n \n3. Further analysis of the model's generalizability could be insightful. This will help readers gauge the model's applicability to other problems within the broader particle detection domain."

In appendix B (previously Section 5), we demonstrate the model on a toy example with arrows in 3D. For the electron recoils, the shape of the ionization track is unique for each sample and highly variable. The shapes also depend heavily on the energy of the electron recoils and the amount of gaussian smearing applied (a parameter of the detector setup), and in our experiments we have varied both of these to show that our model generalizes well."

                    "value": "I have two concerns with the paper that I will classify as \"weaknesses\". \n\n1. While the results shown on simulated test cases are encouraging and show that the approach works in principle, it is unclear how large the sim-to-real gap is. It is hard to determine how realistic the Degrad simulations are as compared to real measurements of electron recoils. Furthermore, Degrad presumably carries with it a whole host of parameters; a few are mentioned in the text (e.g., gas mixtures, temperatures, pressure, etc.). While I understand that the combination of parameters chosen was inspired by prior work (Jaegle et al.) it is unclear how well these parameters are constrained in reality and what happens to the deep-learning model if it encounters variations such as those expected in real data. E.g., does the model completely break if we now test it on trajectories generated at 21\u00b0 instead of 20\u00b0, etc.? These tests for systematic error sources won't determine the gap between simulation and reality, but they will be a first step towards that goal. I think that additional experiments explicitly testing these potential sources of systematic errors and/or a discussion that fully discloses these limitations should be present. The discussion should include what is key or missing from having this work on real (not simulated) data.\n\n2. It is unclear from the paper exactly what the key novelty is. Initially, I thought that this is the first DL framework for the task, as is also demonstrated by the result comparison in Fig. 4. After reading the conclusion, it was unclear if there were prior DL works, and this paper introduces the von Mises Fisher distribution for prediction. It crucial to clearly clarify this in the text. If this is not the first DL approach to the task, I would expect a comparison with prior DL approaches.\n\nMinor comments\n--------------------\nI have a few minor comments that also need addressing:\n\n1. Section 5 probably should be moved to the supplementary, but in any case, it should not be after Section 4.3. Estimating an arrow might be a sanity check but it is irrelevant once the reader has already seen more complex examples. \n2. What do the colors in Fig. 1 represent? Ionization? A color bar should be present and this should be mentioned in the caption\n3. Consider replacing Table 1 with a more useful and digestible visual representation, like a block diagram\n4. While the model includes an uncertainty estimate and is therefore heteroscedastic across different trajectories, it should be mentioned that the uncertainty is assumed to be homogeneous along a single trajectory (i.e. all data points within a trajectory have the same uncertainty)\n5. The term \"efficiency cut\" is introduced in 4.3 (first paragraph) but only explained later in Fig. 4"

The problem is potentially useful in directional detection of particles and could be used for dark matter detection. The paper models the initial directional distribution as a von Mises-Fisher distribution an uses a sparse-convolution network to fit the model parameters using. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated through experiments on simulation data."

It also does not explain why the specific choices of simulation parameters, as describes in section 4.1, are determined. For example, would performing Gaussian smearing on the simulation data favor the Gaussian-like von Mises-Fisher model, and it is not clear whether the proposed model is still a good choice for real-world data. \n  \n- Technical contribution to the learning community.\n\n  The 3D sparse convolution and von Mises-Fisher probabilistic model are well-established techniques and do not seem to provide too much insight for the learning community. This work may be better suited for a conference/journal in physics.\n\n  The work would be more valuable if it studies the effectiveness of different 3D learning architectures and probabilistic models when applied to real-world electron recoil data, or demonstrate the sim-to-real transferablility of such models."

                        "value": "Thank you for you valuable time and feedback. We address the weaknesses and questions below.\n\n# Re: Lack of real-world experiments.\n\nUnder \u201cReal-World Evaluation and the sim-to-real gap\u201d in our general response, we discuss the scope of our paper.\n\nPlease also see \u201cGeneral comments about sim-to-real gap and systematic errors\u201d where we elaborate on the sim-to-real gap.\n\nThe specific choice of our simulation parameters is based on Jaegle et al. (2019). We have slightly modified the text on Section 4.1 to emphasize this further. The choice of binning segmentation was deliberately conservative with respect to what is experimentally achievable.\n\nGaussian smearing, which models the diffusion, is not the only thing influencing the directionality of the track. The multiple scattering that is simulated by Degrad also influences directionality. Furthermore, diffusion is a Gaussian process, so if this process does favor the von Mises-Fisher distribution, then that motivates using the von Mises-Fisher distribution.\n\nPlease also see our response \u201cRe: systematic errors\u201d where we demonstrate our model is robust against small fluctuations in the simulation parameters.\n\n# Re: Technical contribution to the learning community.\n\nWhile the von Mises-Fisher distribution is well-established, no other deep learning approaches utilize it in the way we do. We believe this work is well suited for a machine learning conference because\n\n1. Predicting direction is a general problem. \n2. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning approach which probabilistically predicts 3D direction distributions\n\nFurthermore, our work includes other contributions such such as the approximations needed for stable training and tests of model calibration. Please see \u201cInterest to the community / key Novelties\u201d in our general response comment, where we elaborate on our contribution.\n\n# Re: Some detailed information in section 3, such as 3.4, would better fit in the experiment section(e.g., section 4.2).\n\nThank you, we agree and have moved the text to Section 4.2\n\n# Re: What considerations are taken to determine the specific simulation parameters are used in section 4.1? Why is the test set different from the training set and how are the specific parameters determined?\n\nThe specific simulation parameters are addressed in our response above. \nThe model is trained on electron recoil simulations in the 40-50 keV with Gaussian smearing in the  160 \u2212 466 \u03bcm range. For Testing, it makes sense to compare performance in specific cases, i.e. low energy versus high energy and low diffusion versus high diffusion. This way, we test our models in cases where it is harder / easier to determine the direction. Aside from targeting specific test cases, our training and testing data is produced in exactly the same way."
