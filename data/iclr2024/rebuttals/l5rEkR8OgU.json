Indeed, our architecture and initialization are somewhat non-standard. We use this setting in order to simplify our theoretical analysis, but we believe that similar results also hold for more \u201cstandard\u201d networks, at the cost of making the analysis much more involved. Specifically, we would like to note that while our initialization ensures that the gradient over the parity distribution (at initialization) is exactly zero, it can be easily shown (e.g., using an analysis similar to [1]) that for any choice of architecture and initialization, the gradient over the parity is extremely small (that is, exponentially close to zero). Also note that we also report empirical experiments with \u201cstandard\u201d choices of network architectures, which validate our theoretical findings.\n2. Thank you for your suggestions. These experiments can indeed contribute to the paper, and we will add them to the final version of the manuscript.\n\nPlease consider raising your score if you feel that your concerns were answered, and if not we are happy to continue discussing your comments.\n\n[1] https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/shalev-shwartz17a/shalev-shwartz17a.pdf"

We do note that it is very common in our field to have the Related Works as a subsection of the introduction, and to have a combined Discussion and Conclusions section.\n\nThe main claim in the paper is that intermediate supervision, which is required for solving some hard tasks, can happen naturally by training on a mixture of tasks. For example, computing the parity function over some subset of bits is hard to learn by itself, but when we train on a mixture of the parity and the sum task (where the goal is to compute the sum of the bits in the subset), learning becomes easy. We call this type of supervision implicit, because nowhere in the training process did we \u201cforce\u201d the network to use its ability to compute the sum in order to compute the parity. In contrast, to provide explicit supervision, we could for example construct a dataset which includes \u201cchain-of-thought\u201d reasoning that forces the model to first compute the sum, and then use this result to compute the parity. We claim that implicit supervision appears more naturally in data \u201cin-the-wild\u201d (for example, data randomly scraped from the internet). Such data is very likely to contain many different tasks which can positively contribute to each other, but might not include clean step-by-step supervision for particular problems of interest. Generating such step-by-step supervision usually requires costly human annotations. In this sense, we claim that implicit supervision is \u201cbetter\u201d. We will update the manuscript to clarify this distinction between implicit and explicit intermediate supervision.\n\nRegarding your question: note that we do not argue that all tasks help each other, and it is indeed possible that training on one task harms the performance of another task. Our focus is mainly on showing that in some cases, one task can dramatically improve the performance of another task.\n\nPlease consider raising your score if you feel that your concerns were answered, and if not we are happy to continue discussing your comments."

The paper then proposes two settings, multi-tasks and multi-labels, and uses a synthetic parity learning problem and feed-forward network structure to theoretically justify the motivation. During experiments, authors conduct experiments on transformer architectures and other datasets to show the generality of the proposed approach."

Since our theoretical understanding of deep learning is limited, mathematical analysis of the behavior of neural networks in \u201cgeneral\u201d cases is typically hard. Similarly to many theoretical works, we focus on a specific \u201ctoy\u201d problem setting to demonstrate the phenomenon we wish to study. For this, we chose to use the Parity problem as a canonical \u201chard\u201d problem studied in many other works. \n\n2. We agree with the reviewer that curriculum learning is very related to the topic of our paper. However, curriculum learning studies how the order of learning of examples in a given dataset can improve or speed up learning, while we focus on how examples from one task improve the performance on another task, when both tasks are trained together. We are unaware of datasets that are specifically used for curriculum learning which are directly relevant for us to study. That said, following your suggestion, we will add an experiment on a natural dataset in the final version of our paper.\n\nPlease consider raising your score if you feel that your concerns were answered, and if not we are happy to continue discussing your comments."

However chain of thought requires using more compute at inference time, since the model has to generate many tokens to produce the chain of thought. This work explores an alternative approach, which involves training models in either the multi-task or multi-label setting. The idea being that training the model to complete simpler tasks can help it to learn to solve more complex tasks. They explore this on a simple parity task, which has been shown to be challenging to neural networks to learn, and on a math reasoning task and a code interpretation task. In each setting they observe that mixing simpler tasks into the dataset or defining a multi-label problem, helps the model to solve the more complex task. Without the additional supervision, the model either fails to learn at all or learns much more slowly. They also provide some theoretical results on their parity task. The results pain an interesting picture about why language model pretraining is so effective."

However chain of thought prompting (the predominate way to get LM to output intermediate reasoning) only requires a handful of examples that can usually be written by a single person in a few minutes. Whereas their method would require collecting or synthesizing large datasets. I feel that a potentially more interesting framing could be around understanding how large scale pretraining (multitask) can enable LMs to learn tasks which are typically challenging for neural networks to learn on their own."

We address the weaknesses below.\n\n**Choice of Synthetic Datasets:**\n\nIn our study, we opted for synthetic datasets primarily due to their simplicity and clarity in defining tasks. While we recognize that this choice might limit the direct applicability of our findings to more complex, real-world scenarios, we believed it was necessary for examining the contribution of implicit intermediate supervision in a methodical way.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of demonstrating that our findings are applicable in real-world LM pretraining settings. To this end, we refer to the recent model, OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B, a state-of-the-art 7B parameter Language Model. During its development, the authors found that mixing a natural language instructions dataset with a code instruction dataset in a good ratio (around 10% of the total dataset) boosts model performance on several non-code benchmarks, including TruthfulQA, AGIEval, and GPT4All suite [1]. This aligns directly with our findings, suggesting that our conclusions are not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable in advanced LLM pre training scenarios.\n\nFurther substantiating our findings, existing academic literature, such as [2], also aligns with our conclusions. While the focus of [2] is primarily on the impact of pretraining with code to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs, it inadvertently supports our theory regarding implicit intermediate supervision. It is important to note that our work complements these existing studies by providing a theoretical underpinning for the observed empirical benefits, thereby filling a crucial gap in the current understanding of LLM training methodologies.\n\n**Framing:**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that the primary contribution of our work lies in settings like pre-training, where intermediate supervision is implicit and does not require the collection or synthesis of additional datasets.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. We agree with the reviewer that the question of how scaling affects implicit intermediate supervision is an interesting question that should be addressed in future work. Note that both our theory and the conducted experiments are in the (relevant) overparameterized regime\n2. To minimize the potential for unrelated distractions, we initialized the models from scratch.\n\n[1] https://huggingface.co/teknium/OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral-7B \n\n[2] https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.90.pdf"
