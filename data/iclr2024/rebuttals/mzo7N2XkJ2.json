Specifically, the authors identify that existing defenses that were developed against bounded UDs are not effective against unbounded UDs, and they propose COIN, a new defense tailored for unbounded UDs. This defense is based on left-multiplying a carefully designed random matrix with the unlearnable sample. The authors claim that COIN is motivated by the fact that defending against unbounded UDs should enhance intra-class matrix inconsistency ($\\Theta_{imi}$) and inter-class matrix consistency ($\\Theta_{imc}$)."

                    "value": "- Overclaim. 1. It is not true that existing defenses are not effective against unbounded UDs. For example, as can be seen from Table 2, ISS-J is consistently the best defense across all model architecture and largely surpasses COIN. Related to this point, the authors are highly recommended to highlight the superiority of ISS-J in the table and the text. Currently, it is completely not mentioned at all. In addition, the authors of OPS have also admitted that OPS is clearly vulnerable to median filtering (see the concerns from multiple reviewers about this and the authors\u2019 response in https://openreview.net/forum?id=p7G8t5FVn2h). 2. A defense that claims robustness under a specific threat model (here, the Lp bound) is not meant to be robust under another threat model (here, the unbounded). Therefore, it is expected that existing bounded defenses are not effective against unbounded UDs. The authors should tune down the claim that such a finding is a blind spot in existing work. Instead, it is enough that the authors say they are the first work to focus on defenses against unbounded UDs.\n\n- Questionable idea. Actually, it is obvious that intra-class consistency and inter-class inconsistency are needed for any classification problem (simply say a dog is consistent with another dog but inconsistent with a cat). This is also the natural reason why previous work on (bounded) UDs has started their studies with the so-called class-wise perturbations, which directly satisfy both intra-class consistency and inter-class inconsistency. Recent work of Segura et. al has specifically explored the vulnerability of such class-wise UDs and proposed orthogonal projection (OP) to counter them. It is somehow strange OP does no work against unbounded UDs (CUDA) because it follows the same idea of disrupting intra-class consistency and inter-class inconsistency. Can the authors provide any explanations? This question motivates my following point about the design of COIN. Specifically, I suppose the reason why COIN works (but OP does not) on CUDA is that COIN is specifically designed to disrupt the matrix structure in CUDA. If this is the case, intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency become irrelevant to the success and should be removed from the paper.\n\n- Lack of motivation for COIN. Although intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency are indeed demonstrated to be relevant to the accuracy recovery, it is not clear why the specific design of COIN, i.e., random matrix multiplication, explicitly addresses these two factors. Instead, its design is specifically tailored for CUDA, based on the matrix operations the authors have explained. In general, this is also a problem that the defense is designed based on the knowledge of a specific attack. This suggests that the defense may not be generalizable to other possible attacks (under the same threat model but with a different way of matrix formulation)."

                        "value": "> Q1. Overclaims about the existing defense effectiveness against unbounded UDs. \n\nA1. Thank you for highlighting the importance of precise language in our claims. We have revised our statement to more accurately reflect the current state of defense solutions against unbounded UDs. The revised claim now reads: \"While some existing defense solutions show effectiveness against specific instances of unbounded UDs, a universally effective defense for all such scenarios is yet to be developed.\" We acknowledge the significant performance of ISS-J, as evidenced in Tab. 2 (already moved to Tab. 1), and have accordingly highlighted its superiority in both the table and our text in our updated paper. Your feedback has been instrumental in enhancing the precision and clarity of our manuscript, and we sincerely appreciate your constructive suggestions.\n \n \n\n> Q2. Should tune down the claim that such a finding is a blind spot in existing work. \n\n\nA2. We thank you for your insightful recommendation. In line with your suggestion, we have moderated our claim regarding the existing research 'blind spot'. Our revised manuscript now emphasizes that our work represents a complementary addition to the existing body of research, focusing specifically on defenses against unbounded UDs. We highlight this as a novel contribution of our study, rather than as a critique of previous works. This adjustment aligns our paper more accurately with the ongoing research dialogue in this field. We are grateful for your valuable feedback, which has significantly contributed to improving the clarity and quality of our research.\n \n \n\n> Q3. It is obvious that intra-class consistency and inter-class inconsistency are needed for any classification problem (simply say a dog is consistent with another dog but inconsistent with a cat) .\n\n\nA3. Thank you for your comment. It seems there might be a misunderstanding regarding the metrics we introduced. Unlike traditional intra-class consistency and inter-class inconsistency in image classification, our metrics \u2013 intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency \u2013 are specifically designed to quantify the unique characteristics of multiplicative matrix noise in unbounded UDs. This is a distinct form of noise compared to the additive noise commonly found in bounded UDs. For example, as illustrated in Fig. 10, unbounded perturbations within the same class (in CUDA) demonstrate non-identical noise patterns, a phenomenon differs to the class-wise form we understand in additive noise. These new metrics are crucial for understanding the behavior of unbounded UDs and guiding our development of effective defense strategies against them.\n\n \n \n\n> Q4. Why does OP not work against CUDA?\n\nA4. Your question about the effectiveness of OP against CUDA is insightful. The key reason OP does not perform well against CUDA perturbations lies in the nature of the noise. CUDA introduces a type of noise that is fundamentally different from the traditional class-wise noise, for which OP was designed. As shown in Fig. 10, unbounded perturbations in CUDA within the same class exhibit distinct noise patterns, rendering OP's matrix decomposition approach ineffective. In contrast, our COIN method is tailored to specifically address the different noise structure of unbounded UDs, enabling it to effectively counter these perturbations where OP falls short. This distinction is crucial and underlines the novelty and necessity of our approach in handling unbounded UDs.\n\n> Q5. Lack of motivation for COIN: Why the design of random matrix multiplication?\n\nA5. Thank you for your constructive feedback. We understand your concern regarding the specific design of COIN and its generalizability. Due to space limitation, we expanded the explanation of our random matrix multiplication design in Appendix A.1.2, as referenced in Section 3.5 in our original paper. Our design philosophy for COIN is not limited to countering CUDA's matrix operations but is grounded in a broader understanding of unbounded UDs, including various matrix forms such as diagonal and triangular matrices.\nWe acknowledge that designing a defense based on specific attack knowledge presents challenges in generalizability. However, our approach with COIN is to establish a strong foundation against known unbounded UD forms, with the anticipation that this foundation will provide robustness against future, yet-to-be-seen attacks within the same threat model. We believe this strategy balances the need for specificity in counteracting known threats while maintaining a degree of flexibility for adaptation to new challenges."

                        "value": "Summary of my previous main concerns, which require additional experiments:\n\n1. The authors claimed that their COIN is effective against unbounded attacks. However, it only achieves the best results against a specific type of unbounded attack, the matrix-based attack. Specifically, COIN is even less effective against ISS-J, which was claimed by the authors to be a \"bounded\" defense. This indicates that the defense is limited to matrix-based attacks and no experiments on other types of unbounded attacks are tested. The above conflict is not addressed in the revised paper. \n\n2. The authors claim that CUDA perturbation is different from class-wise (bounded) perturbations. However, there are no experiments to support this. In the original work of OP, \"Availability Attacks Create Shortcuts\" and other cited papers, sample-wise perturbations also mostly rely on linear separability. Therefore, it is necessary to show evidence that CUDA does not rely on linear separability to explain that OP does not work against CUDA but COIN works."

To address your concern, we designed a brand-new non-matrix-based unbounded attack, termed as Unbounded URP. Specifically, we added the same Gaussian noise to each category of images without norm constraints, and then clipped the pixel values to the range [0,1], which is different from the matrix-based unbounded UDs. The mean of the Gaussian noise is set to 0,  the standard deviation is set to 0.02, and the training settings for other experimental parameters are consistent with those in the main text, and we obtained the test accuracy results as shown in the below table. We can observe from the below experimental results:\n\n1. Although COIN is not the most optimal, **it is still effective against non-matrix-based unbounded attack to some extent.**\n\n2. **Our biggest contribution lies in solving matrix-based unbounded attack that previous work has never been able to solve.**\n\n| Unbounded UDs\u2192 | CUDA (matrix-based) | CUDA (matrix-based) | CUDA (matrix-based) | OPS (non-matrix-based) | OPS (non-matrix-based) | OPS (non-matrix-based) | Unbounded URP (non-matrix-based) | Unbounded URP (non-matrix-based) | Unbounded URP (non-matrix-based) |\n| :------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: | :------------------------------: |\n|    Defenses    |      RN18       |        VGG16        |     DN121     |        RN18        |         VGG16          |      DN121       |             RN18             |              VGG16               |           DN121            |\n|      w/o       |        26.49        |        24.65        |        27.21        |         28.39          |         20.15          |         15.95          |              16.28               |              11.65               |              10.19               |\n|     ISS-G      |        25.77        |        21.42        |        26.73        |         29.03          |         26.93          |         21.79          |              23.34               |              23.45               |              26.83               |\n|     ISS-J      |        45.10        |        40.26        |        39.79        |         80.82          |         79.81          |         80.17          |              82.13               |              81.04               |              80.44               |\n|       OP       |        29.77        |        30.33        |        33.82        |         89.50          |         87.12          |         87.95          |              27.09               |              17.81               |              13.06               |\n|      **COIN**      |     **71.90**      |     **73.65**      |     **70.45**      |         80.13          |         74.58          |         72.71          |              57.18               |              55.85               |              65.20               |\n\nWe appreciate your valuable feedback, and we will continue to work towards improving and refining our work.\n\n> Q2: Test the linear separability of CUDA perturbations.\n\nA2: Thank you very much for your constructive feedback.

                        "value": "Thanks for your efforts in conducting new experiments. However, the new results support my expectation that COIN is only optimal against matrix-based attacks. In contrast, ISS-J indeed performs consistently well against another two types of non-matrix-based attacks, i.e., OPS and Unbounded URP. Therefore, it is hard to say whether COIN or ISS-J is better against unbounded attacks. Maybe in general, it is not proper to call something \"unbounded\" attacks because different unbounded attacks may have completely different properties. Specifically, I believe that COIN is just a defense that is designed with matrix knowledge and that is why it is effective against matrix-based attacks, e.g., CUDA. This conclusion largely limits the contribution of this work. I would suggest rejecting the paper and hope that the authors could re-write the paper to convey the actual contribution, i.e., a new defense against CUDA. The new contribution may be more suitable for a computer vision conference.\n\nBased on the new results, CUDA seems to be linearly separable, although not as obvious as class-wise attacks."

                        "value": "> Q1. Provide a detailed computational analysis.\n\nA1. Thank you very much for your suggestion!  Assuming that the time complexity of each line of code in Algorithm 2 is ***O*(1)**, then for an unbounded UD $D_u=${$x_i \\in R^{C\\times H\\times W}, i=1,2,...,N$}, the overall time complexity of performing COIN is ***O*(N\u00d7C\u00d7H\u00d7W)+*O*(N\u00d7H\u00d7W)+*O*(N)**.  Due to the fact that the values of C, H, and W of image $x_i$ are constant, *e.g.,* C=3, H=32, and W=32 for CIFAR-10 images, the final time complexity is optimized to: ***O*(N)+*O*(N)+*O*(N)=*O*(N)**. We appreciate your valuable feedback and have clarified this point in our revised paper. Your comments help us improve the clarity and quality of our research.  \n\nAdditionally, we used the same training parameter settings as mentioned in the main text to obtain the time overhead for each defense scheme on ResNet18 (Using one Nvidia GeForce 3090 GPU and Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218R CPU @ 2.10GHz), as shown in the table below, which demonstrates the efficiency of our scheme.\n\n\n|        Defenses         |  AT  | AVATAR |  AA  |  OP  | ISS-G | ISS-J | **COIN (Ours)** |\n| :---------------------: | :--: | :----: | :--: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :-------------: |\n| Time overhead (minutes) | 131  |  129   |  66  |  35  |  24   |  25   |       32        |\n\n\n\n\n\n> Q2. Transfer COIN to other architectures, other types of data, other datasets, and other tasks.\n\nA2. Thank you for your detailed review and valuable comments on our paper. The issue you raised regarding the applicability of the COIN method to different model architectures, data types, datasets, and tasks is indeed crucial. Allow me to elaborate on how we have addressed this concern.\n\n Firstly, addressing different computer vision architectures, we have extended the application of the COIN method to two state-of-the-art architectures: GoogleNet [1] and InceptionNetV3 [2], using the CIFAR-10 dataset against CUDA. The experimental results, detailed in the table below, demonstrate a significant improvement in test accuracy (%), robustly attesting to the effectiveness of the COIN method.\n\n| Architectures\u2193Defenses\u2192 |  w/o  |  MU   |  CM   |  CO   | DP-SGD |  AT   | AVATAR |  AA   |  OP   | ISS-G | ISS-J | COIN (Ours) |\n| :---------------------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----: | :---: | :----: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---------: |\n|     InceptionNetV3      | 18.73 | 26.04 | 20.11 | 18.87 | 17.65  | 50.62 | 30.40  | 38.58 | 26.52 | 15.41 | 38.49 |  **72.88**  |\n|        GoogleNet        | 21.10 | 24.99 | 24.25 | 26.06 | 21.18  | 47.66 | 24.68  | 39.01 | 23.94 | 22.63 | 41.49 |  **69.07**  |\n\nSecondly, to further validate the adaptability of COIN, we have conducted experiments on a larger image dataset, ImageNet100, with an image size of 224\u00d7224. These additional experimental results have also been incorporated into our updated paper and are presented in the following table:\n\n\n| Defenses\u2193Models\u2192 | ResNet18 | ResNet50 | DenseNet121 | MobileNetV2 |   **AVG**  |\n|:----------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|\n|        w/o       |  25.74   |  26.66   |    21.70    |    16.30    | 22.60  |\n|        MU        |  34.96   |  19.38   |    27.78    |    15.60    | 24.43  |\n|        CM        |  16.54   |  24.04   |    23.58    |    8.00     | 18.04  |\n|        CO        |  25.46   |  29.20   |    23.90    |    17.58    | 24.04  |\n|        AT        |  **37.82**   | 36.80   |    30.34    |    41.42    | 36.60 |\n|       ISS-G      |  14.92   |  13.50   |    9.78     |    5.78     | 11.00  |\n|       ISS-J      |  30.10   |  **37.04**   |    25.52    |    28.04    | 30.18  |\n|    **COIN (Ours)**   |  37.80   |  35.38   |    **35.22**    |    **41.50**    | **37.48** |\n\n\n\n\nRegarding the applicability of the COIN method to other types of data and tasks, we note that the concept of Unlearnable Dataset (UD) currently predominates in the image domain for classification tasks, aiming to protect the privacy of image data. The feasibility and practical significance of UD in other data types or tasks have not been explored in the literature to date. Therefore, we are currently unable to extend the COIN defense method for UD to other data types or tasks. Our paper also refrains from making any claims regarding the effectiveness of COIN for other data types.\n\nFinally, I would like to express my gratitude once again for your insightful feedback. Your comments significantly contribute to enhancing the clarity and quality of our research. We also look forward to exploring the potential application of COIN to different data types and tasks in future studies, further expanding the scope of our research.\nWe appreciate your attention and look forward to making further improvements to our paper.\n\n [References]\n\n[1] [CVPR'15] Going Deeper with Convolutions\n\n[2] [CVPR'16] Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision"

The computational overheads of running calculations for intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency are both within one second on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5218R CPU @ 2.10GHz, with specific hyperparameter settings provided in Appendix A.2. Additionally, since we are the first to introduce the metrics of intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency specifically for unbounded UDs, there are currently no baselines available for comparison in calculating these two metrics."

Furthermore, they propose to employ randomly multiplicative transformation via interpolation operation as their method to defend unbounded unlearnable examples.

From my perspective, it essentially has no difference with the findings widely discussed in previous works: linearity separability is a important factor for crafting powerful unlearnable examples. Increasing intra-class matrix inconsistency or inter-class matrix consistency actually impair this separability to defend unlearnable examples.\n\n2 Though the authors claim performing experiments on ImageNet, they only select a very small fraction of vanilla dataset (20 class, 2%) and resize the image to $64\\times64$ which is still a low-resolution and small dataset. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of COIN on large dataset and considering the computational cost during pre-processing, I would recommend performing experiments on ImageNet-100 with $224\\times224$ image size to further demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. \n\n3 From the perspective of integrity, I would suggest testing the performance of COIN  against OPS on CIFAR-100 dataset . Furthermore, combing Table 1 and Table 2 together to a large table will enhance the visual representation of experimental results for easy comparison.  \n\n4 It seems that the performance of COIN  is worse than those of ISS-J against OPS attack (-5%). However, COIN outperforms ISS-J a lot against CUDA. Why is that? Can you give more explanation?"

                        "value": "> Q1. The intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency is not closely correlated with the property of unbounded unlearnable attack. Linearity separability is an important factor for crafting powerful unlearnable examples.\n\n\nThank you for your insightful perspective! We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the distinction between our findings and the broader concept of linear separability in unlearnable attacks. It's important to note that linear separability, as discussed in the works of Yu *et al.* [1], primarily applies to additive noise in bounded UDs. However, not all additive noise exhibits linear separability, as indicated in [2]. This suggests that the principles governing bounded UDs may not directly apply to unbounded UDs.\n\nIn our study, we specifically address the unique characteristics of unbounded UDs, which exhibit distinct noise patterns compared to bounded UDs. For example, as shown in Fig. 10, unbounded perturbations within the same class demonstrate non-identical noise in CUDA. This pattern of noise differs fundamentally from the class-wise noise in bounded UDs and necessitates a different analytical approach.\n\nTherefore, we introduced two new metrics\u2014namely, intra-class matrix inconsistency and inter-class matrix consistency. These metrics are designed to quantify the unique properties of multiplicative matrix noise in unbounded UDs, which, in our observations, significantly influence their linear separability. By focusing on these metrics, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how unbounded UDs behave and how they can be effectively countered.\n\nOur revised paper includes a detailed explanation of the logical relationship between these metrics and the linear separability of unbounded UDs. We believe this clarification will enhance the comprehensibility of our approach. Again, we thank you for your valuable feedback, which has greatly contributed to the improvement of our research.\n\n[References]\n\n[1] [KDD'22] Availability Attacks Create Shortcuts\n\n[2] [NeurIPS'23] What Can We Learn from Unlearnable Datasets?\n\n\n\n\n \n\n> Q2. Recommendation for ImageNet-100 with size 224x224 experiments.\n\nA2. Thank you for your valuable suggestion to conduct experiments on a larger and higher resolution dataset. In response to your recommendation, we have expanded our experimental setup to include ImageNet100 with 224x224 image size. This adjustment not only aligns with your suggestion but also allows us to test the effectiveness of COIN in a more challenging and realistic scenario.  \n\nIn our updated paper, we have replaced the initial experimental data from ImageNet20 (64x64) with these new results. These experiments on ImageNet100 not only demonstrate the adaptability of COIN to larger and higher resolution datasets but also reinforce the superiority of our approach.  We also show the experimental results as below:\n\n| Defenses\u2193Models\u2192 | ResNet18 | ResNet50 | DenseNet121 | MobileNetV2 |   **AVG**  |\n|:----------------:|:--------:|:--------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:------:|\n|        w/o       |  25.74   |  26.66   |    21.70    |    16.30    | 22.60  |\n|        MU        |  34.96   |  19.38   |    27.78    |    15.60    | 24.43  |\n|        CM        |  16.54   |  24.04   |    23.58    |    8.00     | 18.04  |\n|        CO        |  25.46   |  29.20   |    23.90    |    17.58    | 24.04  |\n|        AT        |  **37.82**   |  36.80    |    30.34    |    41.42    |  36.60 |\n|       ISS-G      |  14.92   |  13.50   |    9.78     |    5.78     | 11.00  |\n|       ISS-J      |  30.10   |  **37.04**   |    25.52    |    28.04    | 30.18  |\n|    **COIN (Ours)**   |  37.80   |  35.38   |    **35.22**    |    **41.50**    | **37.48**  |\n\nWe believe these additional experiments substantially strengthen the evidence for COIN's effectiveness and are grateful for your feedback, which has been instrumental in enhancing the quality of our research."

                        "value": "> Q3. Suggestion for testing COIN against OPS on CIFAR-100 and combining tables.\n\nA3. Thank you for your constructive suggestion to evaluate COIN's performance against OPS on the CIFAR-100 dataset. In response, we have incorporated additional experiments with OPS on CIFAR-100 into Tab. 1. These experiments were conducted following the same rigorous standards as our other tests, ensuring consistency and reliability in the results.\n\nFurthermore, based on your advice, we have combined Tab. 1 and Tab. 2 into a single, comprehensive table. This integration enhances the visual representation of our experimental results, facilitating easier comparison and better understanding of COIN's performance across different scenarios.\n\nThe revised table showcases the superiority of COIN, especially in terms of average test accuracy (%) against OPS and CUDA, further supporting our claims about its effectiveness.\n\nWe truly value and appreciate your feedback, which has significantly contributed to enhancing the clarity and quality of our research. The detailed experimental results and comparisons are now more effectively presented, thanks to your insightful comments.\n\n \n \n\n> Q4. Query on COIN's performance variance against OPS and CUDA UDs.\n\n\n\nA4. Thank you for your insightful query regarding the differential performance of COIN against OPS and CUDA UDs. The variation can be attributed to the distinct mechanisms of COIN's operation and the nature of the attacks it counters.\n\nIn the case of OPS UDs, COIN's strategy of modifying global pixels, while effective against CUDA, inadvertently affects some essential image features. This is detailed in Sec. 5.4 of our paper. However, as shown in Fig. 7, by adjusting the parameter $\\alpha$ in COIN, we can reduce its impact on global pixels, thereby enhancing its effectiveness against OPS. The selection of \n$\\alpha$ is crucial; it is fine-tuned to strike a balance between defending against both CUDA and OPS with maximal efficacy.\n\nConversely, ISS-J's performance lags behind COIN when countering CUDA UDs. This is primarily due to the fact that the extensive global multiplicative noise introduced by CUDA significantly degrades image features post JPEG's lossy compression, as illustrated in Fig. 10 (Appendix A.6). The lossy compression inherent to ISS-J exacerbates this feature loss, making it less effective against CUDA compared to COIN.\n\nWe have expanded upon these explanations in our revised paper, providing a more comprehensive understanding of COIN's operational nuances and its adaptability to different types of unbounded UDs. This elucidation should help clarify why COIN outperforms ISS-J significantly against CUDA but shows a marginal lag against OPS.\n\n\n\n \n\n> Q5. The effectiveness of COIN against bounded UDs.\n\nA5. Thank you for your inquiry. We provided specific details in Tab. 10 in Appendix A.5.1, demonstrating that COIN has a defensive effect against certain bounded UDs.\n\n \n \n\n> Q6. The effectiveness of COIN against sample-wise OPS, *i.e.*, error minimizing noise + OPS.\n\nA6. COIN is ineffective against error-minimizing noise + OPS, as it is also ineffective against error-minimizing noise belonging to bounded noise. Thank you for your attention."
