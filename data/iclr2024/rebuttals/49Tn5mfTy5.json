The proposed method uses the centroids of training distributions in a compressed feature space. It is based on the Information Bottleneck theory and it operates on a codebook of encoders. OOD experiments are on detecting images of CIFAR-10 from the CIFAR-100, and SVHN  datasets. Misclassification detection experiments are on CIFAR-10 dataset."

So, one inexpensive method is proposed to perform two tasks that are usually studied separately in the literature.\n\nPaper is well written.\n\nI am generally positive about the paper, but there seems to be important shortcomings."

                    "value": "Experiments are thin only on small datasets. Specially, for OOD detection, the setting used in the paper is previously shown to be an insufficient indicator for generalization. \n\nThe methods used for comparison do not appear to be the most recent methods in the literature.\n\nLiterature review is weak.\n\n-------\n\nThe reported accuracy of the models appear way below the standards in the literature. In Table 3, the ultimate accuracy of the calibrated model appears to be around 93% percent. Is that a model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset? If yes, then this accuracy does not seem convincing. The testing accuracy of a standard ViT model on CIFAR-10 is around 98% -- with no extra computational procedure. The accuracy of the misclassification detection method by Zhu et al for WideResNet is +97%. Why would anyone use the authors\u2019 proposed method to ultimately achieve an accuracy of 93%? Could authors extend their experiments to models with better accuracies and demonstrate that their calibration method can improve the accuracy of those models? I would suggest downloading pretrained models from the literature, e.g., the models available on HuggingFace, PyTorch library, etc.\n\n-----\n\nThe paper below demonstrates the inadequacy of evaluating OOD detection methods on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN datasets. Specifically, this reference demonstrates that when broadening the range of datasets, most of the OOD detection methods fail to generalize. Based on this, I don\u2019t find the authors' OOD experiments convincing. I suggest authors expand their experiments to the setting used in the paper below and consider more datasets, e.g., iWildCam, BREEDS, etc.\n\n\u2013 Jaeger, P.F., L\u00fcth, C.T., Klein, L. and Bungert, T.J., 2022, September.

See for example:\n\n-- Zhu, F., Cheng, Z., Zhang, X.Y. and Liu, C.L., 2023. OpenMix: Exploring Outlier Samples for Misclassification Detection. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 12074-12083).\n\n-----\n\nOverall, because of the paper\u2019s approach and its broad view, it appears to me that having this paper in the literature would be good, even if the proposed method does not outperform all the other competing methods. However, it would be necessary for the paper to demonstrate its capability in comparison to the most recent methods in the literature and on standard models with good accuracy, models that are freely available in the literature.\n\n-----\n\nI found the discussion under Limitations and Future Work frank and clear, and perhaps a better explanation of the contribution of the paper. The statement of \u201cThe main focus of this work is \u2026.\u201d seemed more on point to me than some of the early statements in the paper. Overall, I think introduction of the paper could be more on point, emphasizing the broad view of the paper early on."

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed and constructive comments! We are also glad that you think our contributions can be helpful to the community. Please find our comments below.\n\n1) *Specially, for OOD detection, the setting used in the paper is previously shown to be an insufficient indicator for generalization.*\n\nWe **extended our experiments in Appendix D.1**. We have chosen regression tasks for several reasons. First, we want to highlight that our model can handle both regression and classification tasks. Second, regression problems are often overlooked by the community. Therefore, demonstrating our model on these tasks could broaden the impact of our paper perhaps more than testing it on expensive/ larger architectures for image classification tasks. \n\n2) *The reported accuracy of the models appear way below the standards in the literature.*\n\n**Our model does not introduce an accuracy drop.** The score 93% in Table 3 pertains to a binary classification task (where the label indicates whether the model will correctly classify the image or not) and not the image classification task. For the accuracy of the model for the image classification, please refer to Table 2.\n\n3)  *I did not see any reference to the misclassification detection literature, but I might have missed it. See for example:*\n\nWe added three references:\n\n   \u2014In the introduction: The recent work of Zhu et al. (2023)\n\n   \u2014In section 5.3: we evaluate the performance of various uncertainty scores in predicting the model\u2019s incorrectness (Corbi\u00e8re et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2022)\n\n4)  *Comparisons are made with methods that are not very recent (as summarized in tables 2 and 3). The most recent reference that authors have compared with is from 2021. Could authors please explain their choice of methods to compare with?*\n\nWe compared our model with single-forward pass uncertainty quantification methods that do not use image augmentations or auxiliary OOD datasets.  **We updated Table 1 to include two models published less than a year ago.**\n\n5) *In Figure 1, the location of points in subfigures (a) and (b) are exactly the same. Is that intentional?*\n\nThis is a great observation! We preserved the location of the datapoints for illustration purposes, i.e., to quickly compare x vs p( . |x). In general, we expect that the datapoints in distribution in P will be reshuffled (while the relative positions will also depend on the divergence used). \n\n6) *Experiments are thin only on small datasets.*\n\nWe would like to note that although CIFAR-10 is a smaller-scale problem, it is widely regarded as a challenging OOD task. We refer you to [1], [2]. We briefly quote here:** \u201cCIFAR Benchmark is NOT Easier than ImageNet Benchmark \u201c** [1]. Moreover, very impactful papers such as **SNGP and DUQ follow an experimental setup similar to ours** while they were scaled to computer vision tasks/large-scale image classification tasks later on. However, we do agree that scaling the experiments will increase the impact of the paper. \n\n7) *For example, how many encoders and centroids would be needed to apply this method to models trained on Imagenet?*\n\nA safe estimation would be to choose a codebook size equal to the number of classes. However, smaller codebooks can still yield competitive OOD performance (see Table 7, cases k=5 vs k=10). In the revised manuscript, right above Table 10, we further discuss the codebook size selection.\n\n8) *Overall, I think introduction of the paper could be more on point, emphasizing the broad view of the paper early on.*\n\nThis is another great suggestion. We have revised the introduction:\n\n\u201cWe introduce a rate-distortion theoretic view of uncertainty quantification in deep neural networks.., Under this lens, \u201d\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yang J, Wang P, Zou D, Zhou Z, Ding K, Peng W, Wang H, Chen G, Li B, Sun Y, Du X.

I now better understand your motivation for the regression tasks -- I raise my score from 5 to 6.\n\nTo be precise, my concern is that when you show your method can detect images of CIFAR-10 from SVHN, it does not necessarily imply that the method can detect the images of CIFAR-10 from other types of OOD images. This is a concern about generalization capability of your proposed method on images. It is not about how fast your method works, whether it uses ensembles of models, nor about non-image inputs.\n\nIn reference [1], you can see a long list of OOD detection methods that can separate images of CIFAR-10 from SVHN, but the same models fail when it comes to separating images of CIFAR-10 from other datasets.\n\nIf authors can show that their method can detect the images of CIFAR-10 from a dataset other than SVHN, e.g., iWildCam, BREEDS, or Camelyon, my concern will be addressed and I will raise my score further. This is what I suggested in my original comments."

Please find our replies below. \n\n 1) *it is unclear how lightweight the approach effectively is (compared to other approaches)*\n\nWe did not observe computation overhead for training our model compared to a single, deterministic network that is not uncertainty-aware. The parameter complexity of our model is provided in Table 2. \n\n2) *the determination of the codebook size can pose serious challenges to the proposed approach*\n\nWe observed that a larger-than-needed codebook will not harm the performance. We **provided some guidelines** on the selection of the codebook size right above Table 10  **in the Appendix**. \n\n3) *only one model is employed for the evaluation* \n\nWe **extended our experiments to also test our model on regression tasks in Appendix D.1**. This set of experiments broadens the impact of our paper, especially since regression problems are often overlooked by current research. In contrast to many related works, our method does not apply only to images and/ or classification tasks. \n\n4) *the evaluation is performed on small-scale datasets*\n\nWe would like to highlight that OOD tasks on small-scale datasets are not necessarily considered easier tasks. We refer you to [1], [2]. We briefly quote here: \u201cCIFAR Benchmark is NOT Easier than ImageNet Benchmark \u201c [1]. Moreover, **competitive methods such as SNGP [3] or DUQ [2] follow an experimental setup identical to ours**. They were scaled/ adapted later on to the applications of interest.\n\n5) *how is UA-IB compared/applies to recent works like [1,2,3]?*\n\nOur work belongs to the class of single-network, single-forward pass models for uncertainty quantification. The work in [4] is not a single-forward pass method (it relies on MC-Droupout). The works [5, 6] are single-forward pass, multiple-network (merged into one) methods that still suffer from high memory footprint. More importantly, ensemble methods are not distance-aware, i.e., they do not explicitly capture the distance of an unseen input from the training data points.\n\nFor a quantitative comparison of our model with these works, please see our comments below:\n\nOur **model** significantly **outperforms packed-ensembles** [6]. Please see Table 1, WR Network in [6], 98.1 (AUPR) vs ours 99.4 and 96.5 (AUROC) vs ours 98.6\n\n**Our model outperforms masked-ensembles** [4]. Please see Table 1 in [4], 0.96 vs ours 99.4 (AUPR) and,  94  (AUROC) vs  ours 98.6\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Yang J, Wang P, Zou D, Zhou Z, Ding K, Peng W, Wang H, Chen G, Li B, Sun Y, Du X.

Evidently, \"lightweight\" has many interpretations, it is important to be more precise, and to focus on the number of trainable parameters if that is the message. As you claim that the method is \"lightweight\", I am expecting it to consume less memory (but this gain seems marginal compared to other approaches) or computationally wise (and you say there is no gap). Hence, it seems the approach not to be much lightweight compared to other approaches.\n\n2. Thank you for indicating the appendix. It is clear that increasing k the performance improves too. However, as feared, k=10 as a trade-off is studied on CIFAR, and is not guaranteed to generalize across multiple datasets. For this an optimization over this hyper-parameter is necessary.\n\n3. On this point, I can not find the details of the different architecture employed for the newly proposed experiments. If the architecture is still Wide ResNet, the weakness remains.\n\n4. There are in the literature works employing ImageNet as a medium-scale dataset to experiment. Among The ones cited, I can reference for example [6].\n\n5. Thank you, I am satisfied with this answer, and I invite the authors to include an extended version of this comparison in the main paper."

                        "value": "Thank you for your reply! Please find our responses below:\n\n1) As you claim that the method is \"lightweight\"\n\nWe used the term lightweight to differentiate our model from broad and expensive model categories such as ensembles or variational Bayesian methods and classify our model as a Deterministic Uncertainty Method (DUM), i.e., a single-forward pass and single model method. Compared to ensembles, our method is more efficient in terms of both compute time and parameters. Compared to variational methods, our method is more efficient in terms of compute time since these methods require multiple forward passes to provide uncertainty estimates. Under the DUM category, all models are considered lightweight. \n\n2)  It is clear that increasing k the performance improves too.\n\nPlease note that for cifar-10, doubling k does not provide further gains. On Imagenet, we expect a sufficient codebook size significantly smaller than the number of classes since it exhibits a coarse class hierarchy. You are right that the codebook size will need to be optimized especially when training on small memory gpus (< 32GB) since it can create a trade-off with a larger batch size.\n\n3)  I can not find the details of the different architecture\n\nWe have now added the details in section D.2.3. We note here that this is a non-image task therefore resnet architectures are not applicable.\n\n4) here are in the literature works employing ImageNet as a medium-scale dataset to experiment\n\nWe remark here that this is very subjective since it highly depends on the availability of computing resources. The authors in [6] mention: \"except for ImageNet, for which we use 2 to 8 Nvidia A100-80GB\". According to https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud assuming training takes roughly a day, training a single model could cost as much as ~300$. \n\n5)  I invite the authors to include an extended version of this comparison in the main paper\n\nWe have now updated Table 1 to include Masked Ensembles in the comparisons. We will repeat the experiments ourselves to properly fill-in the stds and performance on cifar-100 tasks in the next version of the paper."

While some of the baselines the authors selected are known not to scale beyond that (e.g. DUQ, which shares a few conceptual similarities to the proposed work, becomes unstable when the number of classes increases), others (SNGP, Deep Ensemble) do scale and therefore the authors should show extensive comparisons on larger scale datasets (CIFAR-100, ImageNet are the bare-minimum; when evaluating on ImageNet-O, please be mindful about the caveat indicated in [4] about the data imbalance). \n- Especially compared to the deterministic baselines mentioned above, the method induces an accuracy drop.\n\n[0] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07242.pdf\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14502\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02781\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05135\n[4] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11347.pdf"

                        "value": "Thanks for all the feedback! Please find our comments and replies below:\n\n\n1) *Classifying Guassian Process Models like SNGP as deterministic is not correct.*\n\n**SNGP is a probabilistic model with deterministic uncertainty estimates.** This is because estimating the likelihood of the model is a deterministic function of the data. We borrowed terminology used in [1] (for example, **in Table 1 in [1], SNGP is listed as a DUM**). We agree that this can be confusing and that maybe a term such as single-forward pass uncertainty method would be more appropriate. \n\n2) *The fact DUMs that apply regularisation and obtain SOTA OOD detection need to harm calibration is false. Works like RegMixup [1], AugMix [2] and PixMix [3] clearly show this is not the case*.\n\nIn the main text, DUMs, as in [1], refer only to Gaussian Process models and clustering methods that do harm calibration [1]. **For completeness and clarity, we now discuss dataset augmentation methods in Section 6.**\n\n3) *Especially compared to the deterministic baselines mentioned above, the method induces an accuracy drop.*\n\n**Our method does not induce an accuracy drop.** We refer you to Table 2: It performs on par with other DUMs (95.9% accuracy) that do not use dataset augmentations.\n\n4) *There are several deterministic techniques that induces better uncertainty estimation, that the authors neglect. Besides the already mentioned RegMixup [1], AugMix [2] and PixMix [3]. These techniques add no parameters to the model. Furthermore the authors should consider other fundamental baselines from [0]*\n\n**We have revised our results (Table 1) to add two recent baselines.** For example, compared to the suggested RegMixup baseline, our method achieves stronger OOD performance: 96% vs 98% (AUROC) for SVHN and 89 vs 92% (AUROC) for CIFAR-100. \n\n5) *The paper trains on a single dataset, CIFAR-10, which is extremely simple.*\n\nAlthough **CIFAR-10 ** is a smaller-scale problem, it is widely regarded as a **challenging OOD task not easier than ImageNet.** [2], [3]. **In Appendix D.1 we added an additional experiment to test our model on two additional real datasets for regression tasks.** Several baselines in current research treat only images and/or classification tasks. Our method provides a unified uncertainty score for both tasks.  UA-IB performs better or on par with an ensemble of 4 networks on all datasets and all tasks.\n\n6) *DUQ, which shares a few conceptual similarities to the proposed work, becomes unstable when the number of classes increases*\n\n**We do not expect that UA-IB will not scale due to the similarities to DUQ.** Some key differences:\n\n a. DUQ is hardwired to centroids that must be equal to the number of classes. Our model, in contrast, supports arbitrary codebook sizes that do not necessarily match the number of classes (please see Table 10 in Appendix).\n\nb. Our model can handle regression tasks as well (in contrast to DUQ). \n\nc. In our method, we use a different loss function where the assignment of datapoints to centroids becomes in an unsupervised manner.\n\n\n7) *(SNGP, Deep Ensemble) do scale*\n\nFundamental research and empirical research/ scaling experiments are both important. The focus of this work lies in the first category and is to provide a fresh analysis of UQ as a lossy compression of the training dataset. Please also note that **other baseline DUMS (that do not use augmentations) do not provide performance on Imagenet OOD tasks.** Finally, the impactful SNGP was scaled on ImageNet recently, after its publication as an extension of prior work.  \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Postels J, Segu M, Sun T, Sieber L, Van Gool L, Yu F, Tombari F.

                        "value": "Thank you for the response, I have also checked the modifications made in the paper. I find the empirical side to be the weakest and most problematic aspect of the paper.\n\n1 -  Fine, the point is arguable but minor. \n\n2- Can the authors also compare with AugMix and PixMix? Furthermore the numbers of Packed Ensemble and RegMixup seem to be copy-pasted from the respective papers. This is not an acceptable comparison. For instance, the Deterministic (DNN) in the RegMixup paper has lower OOD performance with respect to the one reported by the authors. The authors should run both Packed Ensemble and RegMixup themselves, with the same architecture implementation and training loop and tune the hyperparameters to ensure a fair comparison, as all these factors can affect performance. \n\n3 - Agreed, my mistake. I would invite the authors to consider more recent baselines from [0] still.\n\n4 - I kindly ask again the authors to expand their experimental setting by choosing multiple OOD tasks with varying levels of difficulty, e.g. [0] could be a reference to find hard tasks. Whether the model scales or not is to be verified empirically and cannot be conjectured. This is the strongest limitation of the paper.\n\n4.1 -  As for the UCI datasets, can the authors specify exactly what model is being trained? If it's a simple MLP, given the low dimensionality and simplicity of the data and the models, the computational cost of training 4 members of an ensemble is totally negligible and produces superior or comparable performance.\n\n5 - SNGP has not been scaled \"recently\" to ImageNet, but soon after the code was published. I do not require to perform ImageNet-O experiments necessarily, but I ask to use datasets representative of real data (not 32x32 images) and real out-of-distribution tasks with a high amount of classes and complexity. For CIFAR-10, the simple fact the AUROC of the baseline is around 95% and 89%  (out of 100%) tells it is not a \"hard\" task. The value for the baseline can go much lower in harder settings. \n\n6 - If the augmentation baselines are truly composable with your method is to be verified empirically."

                        "value": "1) We cannot establish anything until the rigorous analysis is run. It's not simply about hyperparameters when the two cross-entropy trained networks in the two papers differ so much, indicating a fundamental difference in the setup of the two codebases that goes beyond hyperparameters choice. (For instance, I also understand the authors have been using tensorflow: the same models trained in tensorflow or pytorch can behave differently in a way that affects the considered metrics even when the methodology is the same). I invite the authors to carry out fair experiments to produce factual evidence and share the code of the implementation of all the baselines to guarantee the correctness of implementation. I also invite the authors, for the third time, to compare with AugMix and PixMix (in a fair setting, as it is expected for serious scientific investigation).\n\n2)  I invite the authors to run their code evaluating the AUROC by flipping the choice of the positive and negative class in presence of strong class imbalance (e.g. on C10 vs SVHN, though the imbalance is not as strong as on ImageNet-O vs ImageNet ... experiment which the authors keep refusing to run for mysterious reasons). To their surprise, the authors will see the AUROC is stable in the presence of class imbalance, while the AUPRC is not. This is mathematically provable in the specific setting of OOD detection. Whether the AUROC or AUPRC are stable to class imbalance remains meaningless to the discussion. It looks more like an attempt to cherry-pick which metric is more convenient to defend the lack of willingness to run proper experiments on multiple datasets. \n\n3) Well, it either does comparatively or worse for some metrics than an ensemble of linear regressors (I have to guess, given the lack of response), which don't take much to train even on CPU. It doesn't prove to be much more useful. If the authors want to prove their method is useful in the problem of regression, they could consider more complex regression tasks that require training proper neural networks and cannot be performed with ensembles (or for which training ensembles would be significantly more expensive than using their method). \n\n4) The authors could check the github history of the benchmark with which SNGP was published to see when SNGP was precisely extended to ImageNet, long before the journal version of the paper. It is anyways irrelevant, as the statement I had made was related to the fact the authors were using the date in which SNGP was supposed to be extended to ImageNet as an excuse not to perform further experiments. The real concern I had raised at point 5 is pretty clear. \n\nAs a general comment, I find the lack of willingness to run proper and extensive experiments extremely concerning about the scalability and validity of the method. I also find the attempt to dodge the main points of the criticism by focusing on minor aspects disrespectful of my time. I start doubting the honesty of the authors. I will not further discuss unless extensive and adequate empirical evidence is provided. Citing papers and extrapolating sentences is not a replacement for empirical evidence."

We haven\u2019t worked on the AugMix and PixMix yet since we were dedicating our efforts and resources to the scalability concerns you raised (which we also think are the most important) and need to be prioritized given the tight timeframe and the resources we currently have. While still very preliminary results,  here are some conclusions we can draw.\n\nWith a codebook of size 30 and encoders of 128-dimension (we assume diagonal covariance in contrast to the cifar-10 experiments), we observe the following:\n\n* UA-IB is able to match the accuracy of 76% of a single ResNet 50 deterministic network (we compare against the pretrained network provided by Tensorflow). We think this is an important result given the compression of the network due to the UA-IB regularization. A similar conclusion was reached in the VIB paper [1].\n\n* Training takes 20 minutes per epoch on 8, 48 GB A6000 GPUs and batch size 128 per core.\n\n* We did not observe any stability or non-scalability issues.\n\n* Calibration AUROC reaches 0.78.\n\nEdit: we started a second experiment right after posting this with codebook size 80. The Calibration AUROC is currently 0.80 (training has not finished yet).\n\nWe do not have results on OOD experiments yet. Moreover, we have not finetuned the codebook size and the rest of the hyperparameters yet. This result refers to a single configuration we tried and took 1.5 days to complete given the hardware we currently have ( a single 8-GPU server). \n\n2) On the regression experiments\n\n *It either does comparatively or worse for some metrics than an ensemble of linear regressors (I have to guess, given the lack of response)*\n\nWe definitely expect that large ensembles will outperform UA-IB as well as other DUMs. However, **we do not consider ensembles direct competitors of DUMs**.\n\n[1] Alemi AA, Fischer I, Dillon JV, Murphy K.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the thorough and detailed review. Please find our replies below.\n\n\n1) *the paper would benefit from a dedicated section that delves into how hyperparameter affects the ua-ib performance*.\n\nAs suggested, we have **added ablation studies** over UA-IB\u2019s hyperparameters in **Appendix D.3**  in the revised version of the paper. \n\n2) *could you discuss potential post-hoc integration strategies for ua-ib with trained models and the expected challenges or benefits?*\n\nOne way this could be done is to apply UA-IB (i.e., codebook and encoder of the pretrained features) on features extracted from the pretrained network. The original VIB paper (section 4.2.5 in [1]) considers a similar setup. **We have revised the paper to discuss this post-hoc integration in Sec. 7**.\n\n3) *why are you not sharing the code for reviewing?*\n\nWe have added the code to the supplemental materials.\n\n4) *scalability to the data sizes seen in high-dimensional image or language tasks?*\n\na. Fundamental methods research and scaling research are both important. This work is studying the former. For example, the impactful SNGP paper [2] was not originally demonstrated on large-scale images. However, we do agree that large-scale experiments will increase the impact of our paper.\n\nb. We are actively working on that.\n\nc. Although **CIFAR-10** is a smaller-scale problem, it is **widely regarded as a challenging OOD task as difficult as ImageNet**. [3], [4]. \n\nd. To broaden the impact of our paper,  we expanded our experiments and tested our model on two regression tasks in Appendix d.1.\n\n5) *could you situate the ua-ib's approach in the broader landscape of lightweight uq or explain why certain methods are not relevant in your view?*\n\nAt a high level, one key difference between UA-IB and all the rest of UQ methods is that it both regularizes the network  (since the codebook is much smaller than the number of training datapoints) and equips it with distance-aware uncertainties (uncertainties that should grow away from the training data). Moreover, our method can measure uncertainty for both regression and classification tasks in contrast to quantile regression, interval networks, and variance prediction which handle only the former. Regarding [7], it can model only aleatoric uncertainty. The primary concern of our work, similar to Gaussian Process models, ensembles, Bayesian Neural Network etc is the estimation of epistemic uncertainty instead which is generally considered a more challenging task [5]. Finally, conformal prediction is a post-hoc uncertainty quantification method. However, leveraging uncertainty during training (or at a fine-tuning phase where UA-IB and backbone network are not jointly trained) can also help the model improve its accuracy [6]. We discuss this as future work in the draft.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Alemi AA, Fischer I, Dillon JV, Murphy K.
