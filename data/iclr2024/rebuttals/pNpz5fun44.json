I guess that the slight improvement in the results could also be attributed to the use of a stronger augmentation technique, such as masking.\n\n[1]. K. He, X. Chen, S. Xie, Y. Li, P.

If it is, why would a student model be advantageous in the initial stages? If not, how many training epochs are required for the student model to select the appropriate patches?\n\n- Several studies have leveraged the masking scheme for efficient learning. For instance, references [1,2] demonstrate that mask-prediction distillation can lead to quicker convergence and enhanced performance. In contrast, this study emphasizes masking teachers to reduce training expenses. I'm curious to know if the proposed method is more cost-effective than the mask-prediction schemes in terms of overall training costs. Additionally, given that these techniques allow for a significantly higher masking ratio for the student network, it's ambiguous whether the savings incurred for the teacher model in MaskedKD surpass the savings for the student model in these studies.\n\n[1] Milan: Masked Image Pretraining on Language Assisted Representation\n[2] Towards Sustainable Self-supervised Learning\n\n- This work only shows the classification performance on ImageNet.

Is it because of the wrong choice of teacher-student pair, or not so advanced distillation method? The authors should investigate into this issue.\n2. Following the last one, the gap of most of the teacher-student pairs are only one level (e.g. base2small, large2base). The only exception is base2tiny. The authors should try more teacher-student combinations, like large2small, or even huge2small.\n3.
