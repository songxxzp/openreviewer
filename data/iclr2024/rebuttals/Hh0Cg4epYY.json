                    "value": "In the context of binary and multi-class classification, this paper derives an upper bound onthe Bayes risk in terms of an $f$-divergence (unfortunately, I couldn't quite understand the inputs to the $f$-divergence). The paper then proposes to train neural networks for classification, and GANs for generative modeling, using this $f$-divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods work (a) for classifying two Gaussian classes, (b) for the MNIST digit classification task, and (c) for generating novel MNIST samples."

                    "value": "Overall, the paper was insufficiently detailed for me to understand either its technical content or its high-level goals.\n\nMany quantities are used without being defined (e.g., in Eq. (1), what are $P$, $Q$, and $X$, what conditions is $f$ assumed to satisfy, etc.).\n\nAt a higher level, it is not clear to me what the goal of this paper is, in relation to the larger literature on machine learning (e.g., what gap or limitation of existing methods does this seek to fill?). Providing some quantitative evaluation comparing the proposed method and existing state-of-the-art methods might be one way to help address this.\n\nSome suggestions on improving the presentation:\n1) In the first sentence of the abstract, \"groundbreaking\" is probably too strong of a word; \"novel\" would be more appropriate.\n2) Typically, square brackets (e.g., \"[7]\") are used for numerical literature citations, while parentheses are reserved for referencing equations (e.g., \"Eq. (7)\").\n3) I suggest adding an \"Organization\" paragraph at the end of the Introduction Section explaining the content and goals of each of the subsequent sections of the paper.\n4) The key novel theoretical results (e.g., new upper bounds such as Eqs. (15) or (23)) should be presented as a self-contained \"theorem\" (e.g., using ```\\begin{theorem} ... \\end{theorem}```), including the precise assumptions made and conclusions drawn."
