Applying inverse generative models seems like good idea and worthy of investigation.\n- The learned concepts do seem to capture regularities in the demonstrated behaviors."

                    "value": "## Presentation\n- In the introduction, there is a claim, that concept inference in decision-making requires understanding of an agent's internal goals. This may be true in general, but I doubt that it applies to the problems considered in this paper. That's because given the concept, the trajectories appear to be more or less Markovian. It would be good to discuss this claim with respect to the contributions of the paper.\n\n## Novelty\n- The proposed method seems very similar to the one proposed in [1]. Considering that this paper focuses on open-loop trajectory generation, I don't see how this is fundamentally different from generating images or any other kind of non-interactive data. The fact that the training data was generated by some process that has temporal structure informs the architecture selection here, but it doesn't change the generation problem on an abstract level compared to say generating images.\n\n## Soundness\n- The \"Formulation\" section lacks in detail. The \"concept\" is never defined formally.\n- The formulation compares the proposed method to inverse RL. However, it targets an entirely different problem setting than IRL, since it does not consider closed-loop control. Generating open-loop trajectories circumvents the biggest challenge in learning from demonstrations, because if the learned policy is never deployed in an environment, it will not face the distribution shift that makes learning from demonstrations hard in the first place. The related work [2] shows that you can learn an action-generating policy by using the data generated by the diffusion model, so we know it is possible. However, there's no demonstration in this paper that the learned generative model can be used for learning policies that work in the environments where the data was generated."

More precisely, the learner is given a trajectory $\\tau = s_1, ..., s_T$ conditioned on some latent concept $c$ (for example, a goal or behavior specification), and the goal is to infer $c$ from $\\tau$. They propose to solve this problem by pretraining a generative model on a large dataset of $(c, \\tau)$ pairs, and then at test time, given a trajectory $\\tau_{test}$, optimizing the corresponding $c_{test}$ by backprop through the generative model. They find that by pretraining on a large dataset, the model is able to learn good interpolation behavior that enables it to compositionally generalize to novel concepts at test time. They evaluate this approach on a toy shape dataset, the AGENT dataset and a MoCap dataset. \n\nThis paper has some nice ideas, but the relationship with sequential decision-making is unclear despite being one of the important motivations in the intro. Also, there are no comparisons to in-context methods for sequential decision-making, which address similar problems. Therefore, I don't think the paper is ready for publication in its present form."
