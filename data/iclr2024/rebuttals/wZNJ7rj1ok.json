The innovative method expands on SPADE's framework by computing node-level stability, leveraging distance mapping distortions on input/output manifolds. The authors' strategy in employing Proximity Graph Manifolds to streamline input dimensions effectively preserves integral structural attributes, marking a significant stride in this field of research."

This advancement fills a significant gap in the literature and provides a foundation for further explorations into GNN reliability, an aspect vital for the broader adoption of GNNs in high-stakes scenarios. \\\nS2: The experimental results are quite promising. \\\nS3: The near-linear time complexity of the proposed method stands out, particularly in a field where computational overhead can often be prohibitive. Furthermore, the model's agnostic nature concerning specific GNN architectures underscores its versatility and broad applicability, a notable advantage in the rapidly evolving landscape of neural networks. \\\nS4: The utilization of PGMs for dimension reduction while maintaining key structural characteristics is commendable. It underscores a methodological rigor in ensuring that the stability assessment is grounded in the preservation of graph properties that are most pertinent to GNNs\u2019 functioning."

Given that SPADE can be adapted to a range of machine learning models, elucidating the specific enhancements introduced with SAGMAN, particularly those that are GNN-centric, would provide clearer justification for this novel approach. The extension beyond SPADE is one of the paper\u2019s core contributions, and as such, a detailed delineation of the improvements over predecessor models is paramount. \\\nW2: The narrative in Section 4 could be enhanced for readability and comprehension. The authors are encouraged to consider relocating pertinent content from Appendix A.5 into the main body of the paper to underscore the PGM's critical role. Furthermore, the \"Graph Dimensionality Reduction via Laplacian Eigenmap\" segment warrants a more lucid exposition. The current presentation may obfuscate the novel methodological insights for readers not deeply versed in this niche area. \\\nW3: The paper could articulate more clearly the rationale behind key decisions, such as the use of graph dimension reduction. Elaborating on why this step is crucial, specifically in the context of GNNs, would strengthen the readers' appreciation of the method's design. Similarly, a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of the use of Laplacian Eigenmap in this process, supplemented perhaps by schematic diagrams or illustrative examples, would greatly enhance the section's clarity and impact."

What specific gaps or limitations in SPADE prompted the development of SAGMAN, and how does the latter address these issues more competently, especially in the context of GNNs? \\\nQ3: The use of graph dimension reduction is a pivotal point in the paper's methodology. Could the authors clarify its necessity and elucidate the specific role and implementation of the Laplacian Eigenmap in this process?"

                    "value": "This paper proposed novel methods for evaluating the stability of GNNs. To measure how much the outputs of GNNs vary when varying the input features, the proposed methods construct graphs by utilizing DMD and PGM. Then, this paper demonstrated that the proposed methods can properly capture the stability of GNNs by evaluating how much the outputs of GNNs vary when adding noise to the input features."

The experiments demonstrated that the proposed methods can measure the robustness of noise added to the input features. They also showed that the proposed methods can be applicable to select weak nodes for adversarial attacks."

                    "value": "* I felt it was difficult to understand the proposed methods due to the presentation issues. According to Alg. 1, the proposed methods seem to consist of four steps: compute_weighted_spectral_embedding, construct_kNN_graph, sparse_graph, and get_low_dimensional_graph, and Sec. 5 tries to explain these steps. However, without looking at Alg. 1 shown in Appendix, it would be difficult to get an overview of the proposed methods from the main paper and Fig. 1 only.\n* The detailed experimental settings are lacking.\n    * It is not explained how the authors tuned hyperparameters for proposed methods and GNNs.\n    * It is unclear what \"SAGMAN stable\" and \"SAGMAN unstable\" indicate in Fig. 3 and Table 1. Did the authors split nodes into stable and unstable nodes by the proposed methods?\n    * It is unclear how the authors measure cosine similarity and Kullback-Leibler divergence in Fig. 3. Did the authors measure the distance between outputs of the last layer of GNNs in the case with and without noise?\n\nMinor Comments:\n* In my environment, the texts in Fig. 1 (e.g., Phase 1 Embedding Matrix Construction) are garbled, and I could not read them. Finally, I could read it by changing my browser from Firefox to Chrome, but it would be helpful if the authors could check the character code, etc.\n* There are several typos. There must be a space before the quotation or parentheses, e.g., \"leads to(Zhang et al., 2022),\" \"non-critical edges(edges whose addition,\" \"a practical solution(Chu et al., 2020),\" \"fast Laplacian solvers(Zhao et al., 2021),\" and \"represented as(Cheng et al., 2021).\""
