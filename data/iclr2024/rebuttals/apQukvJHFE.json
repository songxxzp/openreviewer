This allows for a parametrically and computationally efficient alternative to ensembles. The experiments report improved performance over single deterministic networks and DDU on a range of in- and out-of-distribution uncertainty estimation tasks on various vision classification datasets.\n\nOverall, while the work achieves its aim of introducing a computationally efficient method, the paper does not compare to any competitive baselines despite a range of comparable methods having been introduced in recent years. In conjunction with no new technical material being introduced, I think the paper should be rejected."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- most importantly, the paper sorely lacks a competitive baseline for efficient uncertainty estimation. DDU underperforms even the single net baseline on all non-MNIST benchmarks, on some of them by a large margin (CIFAR100 in Table 2, bottom panel of Fig 4). I don't know if DDU hasn't been tuned properly or simply isn't suited to tasks with a large number of classes, but in either case there are plenty of alternatives available in the literature that have reported good results in this setting, e.g. (Liu et al., Simple and Principled Uncertainty Estimation with Deterministic Deep Learning via Distance Awareness, Neurips 2020) or (Kristiadi et al., Posterior Refinement Improves Sample Efficiency in Bayesian Neural Networks, 2022).\n- the paper is a bit light on ablations. In particular the use of the spectral normalization is not justified empirically. From a theoretical standpoint, as far as I am aware, prior work has justified its need based on the network being distance preserving being necessary for the use of a distance aware output head, however I do not see the proposed method relying on this property, so I would like to see a baseline without spectral normalization. Similarly, the structure of the ensemble heads appears as a magic hyperparameter without justification. I realize that a linear head without hidden layers will probably underperform due to the categorical log likelihood being a convex/unimodal objective w.r.t. the weights of the linear output layer, but this should be justified explicitly and sensitivity of the method w.r.t. this hyperparameter evaluated.\n- the paper does not introduce any new technical material. This is in itself of course not grounds for rejection, combining prior work can be valuable, however I don't see any technical or theoretical contributions that would make up for the lacking empirical evaluation."

Due to time limitations we could not include them in this submission. However, we added ablation studies with experimental results for additional base network architectures and varying spectral normalization coefficients. We show that our method improves OOD detection performance for all analyzed base network architectures. We observe the best performance for the Resnet-18 architecture, although no strong correlation between spectral normalization strength and OOD detection performance. The appropriate choice of context points is still the most important factor in all experiments. The key point of this this work is that the use of the function space variational inference method with an appropriate choice of context points can significantly improve the performance of a single network. \n\nThe additional ablation studies in the appendix are structured as follows:\n\nA4) Base network architecture \n\nA5) Ensemble head architecture\n\nA6) Number of particles\n\nA7) Choice of context points \n\n\nWe genuinely appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to improve our paper. Thank you for your time and consideration."

I have reservations below about some details of the model.\n- The idea makes sense, to increase diversity of ensemble heads by treating the like particles that repel to each other and explore different parts of the parameter/function space, this seems to be applied to ensembles and now the authors propose to use a ensemble with a shared representation network, which lowers the computation costs for inference time. This is important due to researchers and practitioners not using uncertainty estimation methods because of increased computational costs.\n- The selection of baselines seems to be appropriate, even as I make suggestions for better baselines in the minor comments. The paper compares against DDU and ensembles, DDU is a good and recent baseline for lightweight uncertainty estimation (using a single model), while ensembles is the state of the art for simple ways to obtain high quality uncertainty estimation.\n- The evaluation seems to be correct, the paper uses Dirty MNIST and CIFAR10/100 vs several out of distribution datasets, including out of distribution classification of incorrect predictions, and evaluates appropriate metrics: accuracy, expected calibration error, and AUROC for OOD detection.\n- Results indicate that the propsed method MH-POVI and MH-f-POVI performs closely to a ensemble and sometimes it outperforms DDU (also a single model) in terms of accuracy, calibration error, and out of distribution performance, often coming in 2nd place behind ensembles. I believe these results show that particle optimization for shared network ensembling is a viable strategy.\n- There is a good set of ablation results, varying the selection of context points (three) for the functional variant of MH-POVI, showing the effect of this parameter on performance, and also OOD detection on corrupted versions of CIFAR10 and 100, showing that MH-POVI and functional variant are closer to ensembles in performance loss than it is to DDU (which performs worse)."

I believe a fairer comparison is to equalize the number of ensemble networks and particles, or to evaluate both methods with a variable number of particles and ensemble members, which also would provide information about how both methods scale with the number of particles.\n- To me it is not clear what is the form of the loss function that is used to train the model. Equation 2 provides the update rule in the function space, and the paper argues that function particles are represented as neural networks, but then Equation 2 seems to use Equation 1 (in particular the v(f^i) ), but Equation 1 is for parameter-space, and to me it is not clear how to generalize the update rule to function space.\n\nMinor Comments\n- About multi-head architectures for uncertainty, there is also the concept of a sub-ensemble, which is very similar to the proposed method in this paper minus the particle optimization, it is meant to be an approximation to a deep ensemble, here I do not suggest a comparison but just integration into the literature for multi-head network architectures.\n\nValdenegro-Toro, M., 2023. Sub-Ensembles for Fast Uncertainty Estimation in Neural Networks. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (pp. 4119-4127).\n\n- In disentangled classification uncertainty, the authors use a decomposition of predictive entropy using the softmax entropy (aleatoric) and the mutual information (epistemic), could you include information or clarify, how the mutual information is computed for the ensemble heads?\n- Another suggestion for baselines, is to compare against more lightweight uncertainty quantification methods (currently only DDU), for example DUQ, Evidential Deep Learning, etc.\n- In Figure 3, I believe the paper has to say how to interpret these plots, that in the OOD setting ideally aleatoric uncertainty should be low and epistemic uncertainty should be high, while the in-distribution setting it is the opposite (epistemic low and aleatoric variable depending on samples).\n- In Section 3, please explain what is negative data augmentation, this term is not clear from the context of the paper and no citation for further information is provided."

In the revised manuscript, we will incorporate a reference to this work in the related works section.\n\nRegarding your doubts towards the fairness of the comparison: We compared with a deep ensemble consisting of 5 ensemble members in order to keep the number of additional parameters comparable. We added additional ablation studies (see appendix A5, A6), where we evaluate the influence of the ensemble head network architecture and the number of particles. There, we show that for the image classification OOD detection task an ensemble of linear layers can already achieve competitive results. However, this is only achieved for an appropriate selection of context points. By using linear layers, we only add minimal computational and memory costs for the forward pass. Thus, we argue that the comparison to the 5-member deep ensemble is fair, given the significant reduction in parameter cost. However, in our additional experiment we show the results of our ensemble head consisting of 5 particles (see Figure 11) to address your concern. \n\nThe network heads with the function space particle optimization are trained as follows: \nIn each training iteration we load a batch of training data and context points. The context points are used to approximate the particles in function space. For these context points, the repulsion kernel (in our case a Gaussian kernel) enforces diverse predictions of each ensemble member. The other objective, the posterior term, enforces that all particles correctly predict the training data. \n\nWe train our model post-hoc without changing the base network in order to maintain a fair comparison to DDU and the base network scores. Our key observation is the importance of context points for the uncertainty estimation performance (see appendix A5-A7). In all added ablation studies, we test our method for the same selection of context points as in the main paper. In each experiment we make the same observation: The largest improvements are obtained by using unlabeled data points that are related to the training data. As you correctly mentioned, using Gaussian noise does not improve the uncertainty estimates of the function space method compared to the unconstrained ensemble head. This highlights the need and usefulness of context points that carry additional information - in this case, the post-hoc extension to the single model can be significantly improved. \n\n\nThank you once again for your thorough review and valuable feedback. We appreciate your time and effort."

We have carefully considered your review, and we would like to share the revisions and clarifications we have made in response to your comments.\n\n1) We provide additional ablation studies in the appendix of the revised version. The additional ablation studies in the appendix are structured as follows:\n\nA4) Base network architecture \n\nA5) Ensemble head architecture\n\nA6) Number of particles\n\nA7) Choice of context points \n\nWe show that for the image classification task, a repulsive ensemble of linear layers is sufficient to improve OOD detection given that the context points used for the repulsion term are appropriate and informative. By using unlabeled and related image data (kMNIST for DirtyMNIST, CIFAR100 for CIFAR10), we can improve the single model by a large margin with minimal computational overhead for the forward pass.\n\n2) The experimental setting has been selected to be similar to cited related works to simplify comparison.\n\n3) We show that we are able to improve the uncertainty estimates of a single network by adding only a minimum number of additional parameters. During the training of the ensemble head, we use the same batch size for training data and context points. By relying on the features extracted from the pretrained base network, we show in our additional experiments that the size of the ensemble head can be minimal and still provide informative uncertainty estimates. \n\nWe hope that the additional experiments and discussions contribute to a better understanding of our proposed model."

Below are our responses to each of your questions: \n\n\nWe used the uncertainty decomposition proposed in Depeweg, Stefan, et al. \"Decomposition of uncertainty in Bayesian deep learning for efficient and risk-sensitive learning.\" to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The equation is provided on page 6. \n\nAdditionally, we added ablation studies regarding the influence of the base network and the use of spectral normalization for networks with residual connections (see appendix A4 of the revised version). We show that our method is not as sensitive to the choice of architecture and spectral normalization strength, *given* an appropriate choice of context points. We also show that in the image classification task, an ensemble of repulsive linear layers can already achieve competitive results to deep ensembles (see appendix A5). By using informative context points, e.g. unlabeled and related image data (kMNIST for DirtyMNIST, CIFAR100 for CIFAR10), we can improve the single model by a large margin with minimal computational overhead for the forward pass. \nRegarding the choice of number of particles we added an ablation study (appendix A6). E.g, for CIFAR10 we can achieve competitive results when using 20 linear layers on top of the pre-trained feature space, which is a small overhead in terms of computational and memory costs compared to the Resnet-18 base network.\n\n\nWe highly appreciate your time and consideration in reviewing this paper and hope that our comments and ablation studies could provide some clarification."

As such, how much data is used for that semi-parametric representation and how that interacts with fidelity would be an important gradient to show here.\nHow stable is the model to varying that?\nWhich types of perturbations not heir images buy how much performance?\nMore importantly: the authors are proud of having reduced parameter count, but now require a battery of context data for each gradient step of their models. As such, evaluating how this interacts with memory requirements here is key.\n\nIn short: given that this paper jumps on the idea of representing BNNs functionally in a semi-parametric way, talking about the memory requirements for each type of computation and how that Pareto front varies seems as important as reporting the final parameter counts.\n\nThis might also help the authors justify their shared backbone more throughly: possibly the functional representation necessitates techniques to reduce memory footprint like shared backbones to more efficiently use GPU memory since the representation of f_backbone(context) is shared and as such does not incur memory overhead."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\n\nWe appreciate your evaluation and thank you for your feedback. We acknowledge your observation related to the proximity of our proposed model to the work of D'Angelo and Fortuin, as we also mention in our paper. \nThe main differences are the following: First, we show that the function space formulation is not restricted to deep ensembles and empirically analyze the benefits for improving a single network. Furthermore, we discuss the choice of context points for the repulsion loss evaluation and show that improvements are only achieved when using informative context points, e.g. CIFAR100 for CIFAR10. Evaluating the repulsion loss on batches of training data quickly leads to a degradation of in-domain (ID) accuracy. Although our ensemble head does not improve in-domain accuracy, the estimation of uncertainty for out-of-distribution samples is improved. Considering recent research questioning the effectiveness of deep ensembles (\"Deep Ensembles Work, But Are They Necessary?\"), we believe that looking at the problem from a function space point of view can be useful to further improve single networks with low computational effort in the forward pass.\n\nDuring training, we use the same batch size for the training data and the context points. By working with a single pre-trained base network, the size of the ensemble head is significantly reduced compared to ensembles of the base network. Loading context points in batches during ensemble head training results in minor overhead. \n\nFurthermore, we conducted ablation studies on the influence of the base network, spectral normalization, ensemble head architecture, and number of particles, reaffirming that the key factor remains the selection of context points.\n\nThe additional ablation studies in the appendix are structured as follows:\nA4) Base network architecture \nA5) Ensemble head architecture\nA6) Number of particles\nA7) Choice of context points\n\nWe hope that the additional experiments and discussions provide a more comprehensive understanding of our proposed model and its implications. Thank you for your time and consideration."
