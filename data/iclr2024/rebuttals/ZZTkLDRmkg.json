                    "value": "The paper presents a method that involves conditioning a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) with boundary conditions to predict solutions for the Poisson equation. The approach involves training a model to learn the representation of input boundary conditions using a Transformer encoder. Subsequently, this representation is integrated into two message-passing neural networks, which work together to predict the solution. The model can condition the networks with boundaries of different shapes and values."

Notably, both Branch 1 and Branch 2 share an identical architecture, differing only in their input, which comprises the forcing term and the boundary condition.\n> \n\nA1: Thanks for raising the question about different branches. Branch 1, with the boundary input set to zero, is posited to approximate the impact emanating from the interior, while Branch 2, nullifying the interior inputs, is conjectured to capture the boundary's influence on the interior. Specifically, we visualize the outputs of two branches which can fully validate our idea. The visualization is shown in the **Appendix** **M** in the updated manuscript, which indicates a discernible delineation of roles between the two branches.\n\nBesides, you can also refer to **BENO w/o. D in Table 6 Sec. 4.4** of the updated manuscript to see the effectiveness of our dual branch architecture\n\n> Q2: As illustrated in Figure 1, it seems that the encoding of boundary conditions is achieved using a shared transformer, while the forcing term employs two distinct MPNNs. Is this particular choice of architecture a necessary one?\n> \n\nA2: Thanks for highlighting the importance of examining the architecture of Transformers. In response, we have conducted an ablation study where we employed the MPNN architecture to encode boundary information, as an alternative to the Transformer model. The results of this study are presented below. They demonstrate that the MPNN architecture is less effective than the Transformer in encoding global boundary information, underscoring the superiority of the latter in this context.\n\n| Test set | 4-Corners L2 | 4-Corners MAE | 3-Corners L2 | 3-Corners MAE | 2-Corners L2 | 2-Corners MAE | 1-Corner L2 | 1-Corner MAE | No-Corner L2 | No-Corner MAE |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BENNO w/o dx,dy | 0.5985\u00b10.1111 | 1.8584\u00b10.6242 | 0.6175\u00b10.1105 | 2.0114\u00b10.6173 | 0.6255\u00b10.1122 | 2.0424\u00b10.6686 | 0.6145\u00b10.1172 | 1.8982\u00b10.6453 | 0.6445\u00b10.1103 | 2.3310\u00b10.7341 |\n| BENO (ours) | 0.3523\u00b10.1245 | 0.9650\u00b10.3131 | 0.4308\u00b10.1994 | 1.2206\u00b10.4978 | 0.4910\u00b10.1888 | 1.4388\u00b10.5227 | 0.5416\u00b10.2133 | 1.4529\u00b10.4626 | 0.5542\u00b10.1952 | 1.7481\u00b10.5394 |\n\n> Q3: Despite the acknowledged disadvantages of concatenating the boundary conditions alongside the other inputs, it is indeed surprising to see the catastrophic failure of recent advances, such as MP-PDE, as illustrated, especially in Figure 5.

In pursuit of a more equitable comparison, we have adopted additional strategies to enhance the baseline's performance. Firstly, we augmented the original MP-PDE with a virtual node linked to all boundaries (which has demonstrated to improve the performance, as is also supported by our experiments). Subsequently, we conducted an optimal hyper-parameter search to fine-tune the hyper-parameters. The ensuing results are presented below. Despite these efforts, a notable performance disparity remains when contrasted with our BENO approach. The baseline, even with these enhancements, does not successfully resolve the issue at hand.\n\n| Learning rate | Relative L2 | MAE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1e-5 | 0.9324\u00b10.1521 | 2.9755\u00b11.0400 |\n| 5e-5 | 0.8684\u00b10.1471 | 2.7438\u00b11.0008 |\n| 1e-4 | 0.8560\u00b10.1610 | 2.6336\u00b11.0063 |\n| 5e-4 | 1.0036\u00b10.0121 | 3.1454\u00b10.8793 |\n\n| MLP layers | Relative L2 | MAE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 0.9007\u00b10.1381 | 2.8799\u00b10.9726 |\n| 2 | 0.8915\u00b10.1561 | 2.8696\u00b11.0253 |\n| 3 | 0.8684\u00b10.1471 | 2.7438\u00b11.0008 |\n| 4 | 0.8879\u00b10.1312 | 2.8139\u00b10.9726 |"

                    "value": "The existing models for operator learning have struggled to handle complex domains and boundary conditions effectively. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO) model. BENO focuses on elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) and employs separate graph neural networks for learning the source term inside the domain and the boundary values at the boundaries. It leverages message passing and transformers to learn the solution operator. Experimental results demonstrate that BENO offers more accurate predictions for areas with diverse boundaries compared to existing models.\n\n### Post-rebuttal\nI apologize for the delay in my response. Thank you for addressing most of my inquiries and concerns despite the limited time. I appreciate the swift inclusion of various experiments, which has alleviated my concerns. I hope that my questions and suggestions contribute to making the paper even better.\n\nHowever, I still have reservations about the generalization of this method. As observed in the current experiments, the domain handled is limited to rectangles with cut corners. I remain skeptical about its applicability to smoother circles or more complex domains, as I originally inquired. Instead of conducting experiments on similar domains, it would be beneficial to showcase its performance on entirely different shapes and more intricate domains. Although the authors mentioned this as future work in their response, it seems that further exploration in this direction is warranted. \n\nTherefore, based on my personal opinion, I will revise my score to a maximum of 5 points. I greatly appreciate your kind and diligent responses to my review."

Many existing neural operator models often disregard PDEs and neglect boundary conditions when working with data. Furthermore, the problem posed in the paper is crucial in this field since operator learning is typically performed in straightforward domains. Moreover, the idea of using triangulation to locally partition complex domains is a promising approach to tackling these challenges."

                    "value": "However, the paper's focus on elliptic PDEs seems somewhat restrictive, especially considering that it primarily deals with the simplest case of the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. This might give the impression that the novelty of the paper is somewhat limited.\n\nFor example, can the proposed BENO method be applied to Poisson equations with Neumann boundary conditions or mixed Robin boundary conditions? The current model design appears to be tailored to the Dirichlet boundary conditions, which might be considered quite restrictive. To truly highlight the advantages of this approach, it would be beneficial to demonstrate its applicability to a wider range of PDEs, including parametric PDEs such as convection-diffusion equations or nonlinear Burgers' equations. Moreover, exploring its applicability to time-dependent parabolic PDEs could lead to a more generalized operator learning model.\n\nIn this context, the paper experimentally investigates a single type of operator, the one between (f, g) and the solution u. However, it's intriguing to consider whether other types of solution operators could also be learned (for instance, as seen in the FNO paper with Darcy flow, where the coefficient could be an input to the operator, or the initial condition of PDE can be an input).\n\nFurthermore, the experiments in complex domains appear to be limited to similar, complex domains, such as the \"5 different corner elliptic dataset.\" It would be interesting to explore whether the BENO method can be extended and applied to different scenarios, such as domains with circular holes in the center of a square or corners at non-right angles (or more simple, circle domain as in (Lotzsch et al., 2022)). By conducting experiments in more diverse domains and presenting results in a variety of scenarios, the paper could better showcase the novelty and versatility of the BENO method.\n\nTherefore, it would be beneficial to generalize the limitations of BENO, as described in this paper. For instance, in terms of boundary conditions, there are relevant discussions in [1], and graph-based methods have addressed complex domains and a variety of equations and boundary conditions, as seen in [2] and [3], which leveraged Finite Element Method (FEM). Referencing these works might provide valuable insights.\n\nFurthermore, there is some curiosity regarding whether the results of the baseline methods were adequately compared. It appears from Appendix F that the internal and boundary grids for the baseline methods are distinguished using one-hot encoding. It's worth considering if this method provides the fairest basis for comparison. As mentioned in the paper, FNO suggests the use of Fourier continuation for different boundary conditions and domains ('Non-uniform and Non-periodic Geometry' part in [4]). Therefore, it raises the question of whether the paper's approach is indeed the best for addressing complex scenarios. Additionally, there is a model for operator learning called DeepONet [5], which can be applied directly to challenging boundary conditions and complex domains. It would be interesting to know whether the paper conducted a comparison with this model.\n\n*[1] Horie, M., & Mitsume, N. (2022).

While the use of graph neural networks suggests that it might be possible, further explanation would be helpful.\n\n* In the context of 3.1 Motivation, where branch1 is interpreted as the interior and branch2 as the exterior from a Green function perspective, it's important to know whether the output of Branch1 precisely reaches 0 at the boundary and whether the output of Branch2 reaches exactly \"g\" at the boundary. Is this a process of approximating \"g,\" or is the model capable of obtaining the exact boundary values of \"g\"?\n\n* In Section 3.2, a more detailed explanation of the definition of $\\mathcal{E}_{kn}$ would be appreciated. Furthermore, the part around this section involving attributes is somewhat challenging to comprehend in written form. It might be a good idea to exclude this part if it ultimately relates to the explanation in Section 3.3.2.\n\n* Are dx, dy, and dc in Section 3.3.1 uniquely determined for each node? Also, why is dc necessary?\n\n* On page 5, is \"B\" ultimately equal to \"B^1\"? It would be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of where \"t\" changes and what its range is.\n\n* The definition of MAE for Table 2 is present in the appendix but not in the main text.\n\n* In Section 4.3.2, the explanation of training at 32x32 and testing at 64x64, is this capability attributed to BENO's use of graph neural networks, or are there other features enabling this super-resolution? A more detailed explanation would be appreciated.\n\n* In Appendix K, when looking at Figure 6, it appears that the results for \"Ours\" are different from other solution profiles, forming square blocks with discontinuities. What is the reason or cause behind this phenomenon?"

This might give the impression that the novelty of the paper is somewhat limited.\n> \n\nA1:  Despite the focus on elliptic PDEs, we believe this is an important and critical research that can be applicable to a wide range of natural phenomena and engineering applications.  \n\n- **Importance of boundary conditions for any PDE systems.** It is known that any PDEs can be characterized as parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptic PDEs, which further can be categorized as initial-boundary value problem (IBVP), and initial value problem (IVP) and boundary value problem (BVP), respectively. For any of these PDEs, the treatment of boundary conditions plays a critical role in accurately modeling natural phenomena and engineering applications. While we focus on the application of BENO on elliptic PDEs, we believe that the boundary condition treatment and incorporation into the overall solver is applicable to other PDE systems.\n- **Applicability of elliptic PDEs to the real-world phenomena.** The utility of elliptic PDEs is not limited to steady problems, e.g., we can obtain unsteady solution of nonlinear PDEs by repeated solution of elliptic PDEs. For instance, the pressure-Poisson equation (which is an elliptic PDE) for incompressible flows can be applied to unsteady phenomena. Various plasma simulations uses Poisson solver that is time dependent. Helmholtz equation is used in a variety of phenomena, including electromagnetic radiation, seismology, and acoustics. These systems can have complex geometries, e.g., airfoil, propulsion devices, plasma sources for semiconductor manufacturing, with different types of materials (e.g., dielectric, conducting, catalytic, chemically reactive) and inhomogeneous boundary values (e.g., dependent on space and time). Thus, we believe that demonstration of BENO on elliptic PDEs has immense impact to a large number of applications. This introduction is updated to emphasize this point. Besides, we have revised the manuscript to delete the statements that elliptic PDEs are only applicable for steady-state phenomena.\n\nFurthermore, to validate the generalization ability of our BENO, we **also supplement more experiments** on other scenarios in the following part.\n\nBesides, to validate the generalization ability of our BENO, we **also supplement more experiments** on other scenarios in the following part."

                        "value": "> Q4: Furthermore, the experiments in complex domains appear to be limited to similar, complex domains, such as the \"5 different corner elliptic dataset.\" It would be interesting to explore whether the BENO method can be extended and applied to different scenarios, such as domains with circular holes in the center of a square or corners at non-right angles (or more simple, circle domain as in (Lotzsch et al., 2022)). By conducting experiments in more diverse domains and presenting results in a variety of scenarios, the paper could better showcase the novelty and versatility of the BENO method.\n> \n\nA4: Thanks for the positive feedback. Previous work i.e., GNN-PDE, utilizes methodology on circular holes but may have neglected the treatment of complex physical boundary conditions (including combination of Dirichlet and Neumann boundaries, which can be inhomogeneous), which we believe is the key innovativeness of our work. Generalization of the method (e.g., circular, spherical, unstructured meshes) is reserved for future work.\n\n> Q5: Therefore, it would be beneficial to generalize the limitations of BENO, as described in this paper. For instance, in terms of boundary conditions, there are relevant discussions in [1], and graph-based methods have addressed complex domains and a variety of equations and boundary conditions, as seen in [2] and [3], which leveraged Finite Element Method (FEM). Referencing these works might provide valuable insights.\n> \n\nA5: Thanks for pointing out these references. We have added these references in the revised version of 5. Related Work section for a boarder audience.\n\n> Q6: Furthermore, there is some curiosity regarding whether the results of the baseline methods were adequately compared. It appears from Appendix F that the internal and boundary grids for the baseline methods are distinguished using one-hot encoding. It's worth considering if this method provides the fairest basis for comparison. As mentioned in the paper, FNO suggests the use of Fourier continuation for different boundary conditions and domains ('Non-uniform and Non-periodic Geometry' part in [4]). Therefore, it raises the question of whether the paper's approach is indeed the best for addressing complex scenarios. Additionally, there is a model for operator learning called DeepONet [5], which can be applied directly to challenging boundary conditions and complex domains. It would be interesting to know whether the paper conducted a comparison with this model.\n> \n\nA6: Thank you for your comment. In pursuit of a more equitable comparison, we have adopted additional strategies to enhance the baseline's performance. Firstly, we augmented the original MP-PDE with a virtual node linked to all boundaries. Subsequently, we conducted an optimal hyper-parameter search to fine-tune the hyper-parameters. The ensuing results are presented below. Despite these efforts, a notable performance disparity remains when contrasted with our BENO approach.

                        "value": "> Q7: In the paper, it is mentioned that other methods overfit in challenging boundary conditions, but a more explicit explanation of what this means would be helpful. Are there graphs or figures that can demonstrate this concept?\n> \n\nA7: Thank you for bringing attention to the issue regarding the failure of other methods. We have updated our manuscript to reflect a more precise terminology, changing 'overfitting' to 'extremely hard to learn'. This revision enhances the accuracy of our statements. The evidence for this adjustment is evident from **Figure 4 in Section 4.2** and **Figure 5 in Appendix I.3**. These figures clearly illustrate that the baseline methods struggle to converge the loss during both training and testing phases. Additionally, there is a markedly high prediction error when compared to the ground truth, further underscoring the challenges these methods face.\n> Q8: It would be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of what the red and orange parts in Figure 1 represent. What does the red part signify, and what about the orange part? How do they differ?\n> \n\nA8: The red and orange hues in Figure 1 are chosen from the color-bar for our graphical representation, which effectively illustrates the boundary values. The redder the area, the higher the boundary value it represents, whereas the more orange the area, the lower the boundary value. We have added this information in the caption of Figure 1 in the updated manuscript.\n\n> Q9: Regarding Table 1, as mentioned in the Strengths section, is it impossible for FNO to handle 5.? Is it also impossible for GKN to handle 5.? Is there no prior research in the field of operator learning models that can handle 5.?\n> \n\nA9: To the best of our knowledge, no work has stepped in solving elliptic PDEs with complex boundary shape and inhomogeneous boundary value together. As for all of the baselines, we utilize the same information as input for fair comparison and it is obvious that existing vanilla baselines cannot deal with the complex setting, which just demonstrates that a new architecture design is needed.\n\n> Q10: In the Problem Setup (2. Problem Setup), it is not clear whether BENO can be applied to 3D or higher-dimensional domains. While the use of graph neural networks suggests that it might be possible, further explanation would be helpful.\n> \n\nA10: We have refined our setup in **Section 2** to enable its generalization to more diverse scenarios.\n\n> Q11: In the context of 3.1 Motivation, where branch1 is interpreted as the interior and branch2 as the exterior from a Green function perspective, it's important to know whether the output of Branch1 precisely reaches 0 at the boundary and whether the output of Branch2 reaches exactly \"g\" at the boundary. Is this a process of approximating \"g,\" or is the model capable of obtaining the exact boundary values of \"g\"?\n> \n\nA11: Thanks for raising the question about different branches. Branch 1, with the boundary input set to zero, is posited to approximate the impact emanating from the interior, while Branch 2, nullifying the interior inputs, is conjectured to capture the boundary's influence on the interior. Specifically, we visualize the outputs of two branches which can fully validate our idea. The visualization is shown in the **Appendix** **N**, which indicates a discernible delineation of roles between the two branches.\n\n> Q12: In Section 3.2, a more detailed explanation of the definition of would be appreciated. Furthermore, the part around this section involving attributes is somewhat challenging to comprehend in written form. It might be a good idea to exclude this part if it ultimately relates to the explanation in Section 3.3.2.\n> \n\nA12: We have refined the manuscript in alignment with your feedback.\n\n> Q13: Are dx, dy, and dc in Section 3.3.1 uniquely determined for each node? Also, why is dc necessary?\n> \n\nA13: Thanks for the comment. dx, and dy are uniquely determined for each node as the node feature. We have added ablation study that removes the dx, dy to validate its effectiveness, which is shown as follows. It is obvious that this feature is helpful for our PDE solving.\n\n| Test set | 4-Corners L2 | 4-Corners MAE | 3-Corners L2 | 3-Corners MAE | 2-Corners L2 | 2-Corners MAE | 1-Corner L2 | 1-Corner MAE | No-Corner L2 | No-Corner MAE |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BENNO w/o dx,dy | 0.3654\u00b10.1591 | 0.9989\u00b10.3752 | 0.4535\u00b10.2261 | 1.2912\u00b10.5961 | 0.5549\u00b10.2044 | 1.5689\u00b10.5708 | 0.5797\u00b10.2219 | 1.535\u00b10.5039 | 0.5818\u00b10.2219 | 1.7535\u00b10.5547 |\n| BENO (ours) | 0.3523\u00b10.1245 | 0.9650\u00b10.3131 | 0.4308\u00b10.1994 | 1.2206\u00b10.4978 | 0.4910\u00b10.1888 | 1.4388\u00b10.5227 | 0.5416\u00b10.2133 | 1.4529\u00b10.4626 | 0.5542\u00b10.1952 | 1.7481\u00b10.5394 |"

And B^t represents the boundary embedding in the **t-*th*** message passing step.\n\n> Q15: The definition of MAE for Table 2 is present in the appendix but not in the main text.\n> \n\nA15: Thanks for the catch. In the updated manuscript, we have added the definition of MAE for Table 2 to the main text.\n\n> Q16: In Section 4.3.2, the explanation of training at 32x32 and testing at 64x64, is this capability attributed to BENO's use of graph neural networks, or are there other features enabling this super-resolution? A more detailed explanation would be appreciated.\n> \n\nA16: This capability is primarily attributed to the GNN architecture used in BENO. The GNN's capability to handle super-resolution stems from its approximation of the Green's function. The Green's function describes how the value at one location influences the solution at the current position. This characteristic makes GNN particularly suitable for super-resolution tasks, as it adeptly models the interplay and impact of various spatial data points on each other.\n\n> Q17: In Appendix K, when looking at Figure 6, it appears that the results for \"Ours\" are different from other solution profiles, forming square blocks with discontinuities. What is the reason or cause behind this phenomenon?\n> \n\nA17: The key factor is the narrow range of numerical values in shown data. In such a scenario, even minor fluctuations in the predicted values near the corners can result in the values falling outside of a given scale interval on the color-bar. This creates the visual effect of discontinuous blocks, as opposed to a smoother gradient typically seen with a wider range of values."

We have conducted additional super-resolution experiment, where the models are trained on 64x64 resolution, and are tested on irregular domains at a high **128x128 resolution**, pushing the boundaries of our BENO's applicability. The results are shown as below. Specifically, BENO consistently shows superior performance by a large margin.\n\n| Test set | 4-Corners L2 | 4-Corners MAE | 3-Corners L2 | 3-Corners MAE | 2-Corners L2 | 2-Corners MAE | 1-Corner L2 | 1-Corner MAE | No-Corner L2 | No-Corner MAE |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MP-PDE | 1.0543\u00b10.2839 | 0.0997\u00b10.0426 | 1.0475\u00b10.2629 | 0.0982\u00b10.0394 | 1.0206\u00b10.1826 | 0.1291\u00b10.0420 | 1.0144\u00b10.1416 | 0.1645\u00b10.0543 | 1.0063\u00b10.1008 | 0.2257\u00b10.0587 |\n| BENO (ours) | 0.5815\u00b10.1276 | 0.0372\u00b10.0236 | 0.6599\u00b10.2923 | 0.0369\u00b10.0197 | 0.6796\u00b10.2039 | 0.0625\u00b10.0280 | 0.6852\u00b10.1869 | 0.0954\u00b10.0452 | 0.7429\u00b10.1594 | 0.1600\u00b10.0508 |\n\nWe see that our model still outperforms the MP-PDE baseline by a large margin, at this high resolution.\n\n> Q2: It would also be useful to get some additional information about training and inference times for BENO and baselines.\n> \n\nA2: Thank you for your comment. The average time taken for BENO and the graph-based baseline methods during a single epoch, computed over five iterations, is listed below. We can see that the modest increase in computational time of BENO is justified by the substantial performance improvements offered by the integration of the Transformer and dual-branch GNN structures. The added complexity of these components contributes to the enhanced capability of the BENO model, making it a feasible and efficient choice in scenarios where advanced performance is crucial.\n\n| Method | GNN-PDE | MP-PDE | BENO (ours) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time | 0.0054 | 0.0092 | 0.0210 |"

For any of these PDEs, the treatment of boundary conditions plays a critical role in accurately modeling natural phenomena and engineering applications. While we focus on the application of BENO on elliptic PDEs, we believe that the boundary condition treatment and incorporation into the overall solver is applicable to other PDE systems.\n- **Applicability of elliptic PDEs to the real-world phenomena.** The utility of elliptic PDEs is not limited to steady problems, e.g., we can obtain unsteady solution of nonlinear PDEs by repeated solution of elliptic PDEs. For instance, the pressure-Poisson equation (which is an elliptic PDE) for incompressible flows can be applied to unsteady phenomena. Various plasma simulations uses Poisson solver that is time dependent. Helmholtz equation is used in a variety of phenomena, including electromagnetic radiation, seismology, and acoustics. These systems can have complex geometries, e.g., airfoil, propulsion devices, plasma sources for semiconductor manufacturing, with different types of materials (e.g., dielectric, conducting, catalytic, chemically reactive) and inhomogeneous boundary values (e.g., dependent on space and time). Thus, we believe that demonstration of BENO on elliptic PDEs has immense impact to a large number of applications. This introduction is updated to emphasize this point. Besides, we have revised the manuscript to delete the statements that elliptic PDEs are only applicable for steady-state phenomena.\n\nFurthermore, to validate the generalization ability of our BENO, we **also supplement more experiments** on other scenarios in the following part."

We have generated new datasets on different boundary condition (i.e., **Neumann BCs**) type and different types of solution operators (i.e., **Darcy flow**) under our existing setting with different corner cases. Typically boundary conditions can be categorized into Dirichlet and Neumann BCs, or the combination of the two.

                        "value": "> Q6: Can the BENO model be used to generate physically meaningful insights and interpretability?\n> \n\nA6: The innovativeness of BENO is in accounting for the boundary condition treatments in the PDE solutions obtained from boundary-embedded GNN. Handling of the boundary conditions is a requirement for any PDE equations. Elliptic PDEs are good test problems to test such boundary condition effects (cf. boundary value problem). In addition, without accurately capturing the boundary conditions, the solutions for the PDEs obtained from a solver are not physically meaningful and cannot be applied to real systems. Hence, we believe that BENO\u2019s strengths are in producing an acceptable tolerance with much faster computational speed, which generate physically meaningful results and enhance the interpretability of the solutions. \n\n> Q7: There are some latest related operator works that should be referred to for a boarder audience:\n> \n\nA7: We have added [Xiao, Xiongye, et al. \"Coupled Multiwavelet Neural Operator Learning for Coupled Partial Differential Equations.\"], [Gupta, Gaurav, et al. \"Multiwavelet-based operator learning for differential equations.\"], and [Gupta, Gaurav, et al. \"Non-linear operator approximations for initial value problems.\"] in the revised version of **Related Work** for a boarder audience."
