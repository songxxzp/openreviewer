Although our knowledge graph draws from the biomedical field, it can inspire new research in both biomedicine and knowledge graph representation learning fields. Our benchmark dataset represents a novel challenge for computer science researchers, as it represents real-world data obtained from many heterogeneous sources, within the biomedical field.\n\nOf note, none of the existing works so far show remarkable performance on Know2BIO, demonstrating a huge room for improvement in model development, which can inspire new advances in representation learning. Furthermore, our mechanism for updating and benchmarking as up-to-date as possible real-world data are concepts applicable to other benchmark datasets and research fields."

To construct a quality knowledge graph, researchers must have the biological expertise to fully understand the relationships and entities, as well as any associated confidence metrics.\n\nFurthermore, proper mapping of diverse entities across multiple knowledge bases is not a trivial task. Finally, our knowledge graph is represented in a dual-view setting, which needs expertise to properly discern whether entities and/or relationships are ontological concepts rather than instantiated biomedical entities, for which not much prior work has been done."

We have included code to load the resulting knowledge graph into Neo4j and query using its Cypher query language, with an example query. We have uploaded the codebase to deploy Neo4j on Know2BIO to the repository.\n\n- Support for integrating this knowledge graph with LLMs will be explored in a subsequent publication, currently in the works (LLaMA2)."

                        "value": "identify the relevant data sources, the process to align the entities is somewhat straightforward.\nHowever, it was arduous to curate the proper data sources that provide the mappings (e.g., to find a path of \u201cis_a\u201d relationships between the head and tail entities from two data sources). We had certain biomedical relationships we were interested in (e.g.,  gene-disease, protein-function, or drug-side effect), based on our domain knowledge (our data curation team has backgrounds in biological sciences.) To find data sources that provide this information, we searched online, looked into data sources used by other well-known biomedical knowledge graphs, and investigated data sources we had known previously. Through this process, we became very familiar with the available resources and which ones were commonly used and reputable. To choose the main identifier to use for each data type (e.g., UniProt ID for all protein nodes), we depended on the identifier mappings that were available and used the most. For example, UniProt IDs are used almost universally, though some data sources have their IDs (e.g., STRING, TTD). Therefore, we chose to use UniProt and map the less commonly used IDs to UniProt. To reiterate, the decisions about biomedical data types were informed by our biomedical understanding and data availability; the decisions about the identifier mappings were informed by our understanding of and wrangling with the data sources.\n\nThere are other KBs with additional data not contained in our 30 data sources which could be useful (e.g., clue.io). We are considering supplementing the KG with this information. However, the data is currently quite extensive, both in terms of biomedical information and data sources, and includes numerous major biomedical knowledge bases. \n\nDoes this answer clarify our process or do the questions remain? We would be happy to provide more information and update the paper accordingly if needed."

                        "value": "Here is our new \"Future Works\" section with more concrete methods that could be tried:\n\nFuture benchmarking work on Know2BIO can test various models in graph learning\n(e.g., KG embeddings, GNNs), multi-modal models (e.g., text and graph embedding models), and\ntraining strategies (e.g., parameter initialization, curriculum learning). Multi-view graph learning\napproaches can take advantage of the separate instance and ontology views. Multi-modal models\ncan use the non-KG data modalities to further enrich the KG with a wider array of information. To\nelaborate, the non-KG data modalities can be extracted (e.g., by language models, graph learning\nmodels) and integrated as node information into knowledge graph learning models via different\nfeature fusion approaches (e.g., early, mixed, late fusion). Some feature fusion approaches can also\ndouble as a pre-training parameter initialization strategy, one of many initialization strategies to\ntest. The edge weights can be utilized by graph learning approaches that incorporate weights into\nthe training objective. Edge weights can also be used for curriculum learning. This will enable\nresearchers to access a more extensive and holistic view of biomedical knowledge, providing a wider\nrange of benchmarking tasks and challenges.\n\nAdditionally, other emerging technologies can take advantage of Know2BIO. In particular, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) can leverage the up-to-date information and structure of Know2BIO. This\ncan facilitate reasoning and mitigate hallucination for the LLM, both for predictive analyses (e.g.,\nin-context learning) and retrieval augmented generation (e.g., multi-hop question answering). We\nplan to explore each of these topics in future works."
