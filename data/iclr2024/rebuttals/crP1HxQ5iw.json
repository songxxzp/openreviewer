                    "value": "This paper proposed a multi-agent trajectory prediction model based on diffusion models, named scalable diffusion transformer (SDT). The proposed SDT model consists of 1) a transformer encoder that encodes environment embeddings from historical trajectories and context information, and 2) a transformer decoder that iteratively diffuses the predicted joint trajectories conditioned on the environment static embedding. SDT was tested on the Argoverse 2 dataset for vehicle trajectory prediction and on the NBA dataset for human trajectory prediction. Especially, it achieved state-of-the-art results on the NBA dataset."

                    "value": "Even though I found the idea of using diffusion models for multi-agent trajectory prediction interesting and sensible, the paper lacks novelty and sufficient technical contributions to advance the research on this topic. \n\n1. The paper does not place itself well among the latest literature on multi-agent trajectory prediction in autonomous driving. In particular, the authors should compare the proposed SDT model against MotionDiffuser [1], a diffusion-based joint trajectory prediction model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on WOMD. In my opinion, SDT is a fairly straightforward adoption of diffusion for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Compared to MotionDiffuser, this work lacks an in-depth analysis of the model design (e.g., latent space in MotionDiffuser) and does not sufficiently show the advantages of diffusion models in the multi-agent trajectory prediction problem (e.g., controllable trajectory synthesis in MotionDiffuser). Also, the authors should compare SDT with other joint trajectory prediction models that do not rely on diffusion, for example, JFP [2] and QCNetXt [3], and discuss the advantages of diffusion compared to the other methods. \n\n2. The performance of SDT on the argoverse2 dataset is not very satisfying. Also, the results are not well presented and diagnosed. In the marginal trajectory prediction task. the proposed SDT model performs much worse than the current state-of-the-art models. It performs on par with LaneGCN (Liang et al. 2020), which is a fairly outdated model. In the multi-agent trajectory prediction task, SDT is only compared against SceneTransformer. SDT's prediction accuracy is, in fact, quite far away from the state-of-the-art results from the leaderboard. For example, QCNetXt achieved a $minFDE_6$ of 1.02, while SDT's $minFDE_6$ is 3.75. While the authors' explanation is reasonable (i.e., those SOTA models have adopted sophisticated techniques to best tailor their models for the traffic prediction problem), it is misleading to not show a comprehensive comparison of SDT against SOTA results from the leaderboard, especially for the multi-agent trajectory prediction task. Also, while I don't think achieving SOTA performance is the only way to show the merits of a prediction model, the current results on Argoverse 2 are unfortunately not sufficient to demonstrate the advantages of using diffusion for traffic prediction. Why should we prefer diffusion over other methods for traffic prediction, if its performance is far away from SOTA, especially considering the significant computational cost of diffusion during the inference time?\n\n3. The results of traffic generation could potentially strengthen the motivation behind adopting the proposed SDT model. However, the generation experiments were only conducted on an internal dataset and the results were not disclosed. The authors' description of the experimental results cannot be trusted and is not convincing, without solid and detailed numerical results. It would also be better to conduct additional experiments on public datasets so that the results can be reproduced. \n\n[1] Jiang, Chiyu, et al. \"MotionDiffuser: Controllable Multi-Agent Motion Prediction using Diffusion.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023.\\\n[2] Luo, Wenjie, et al. \"Jfp: Joint future prediction with interactive multi-agent modeling for autonomous driving.\" Conference on Robot Learning.

[1,2,3] are all recent methods that were not cited, and are quite similar to the proposed approach. Of particular interest is MotionDiffuser which also uses attention layers to model the multi-agent diffusion problem. I believe this needs to be addressed.\n\n[1] Xu, Chejian, Ding Zhao, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and Bo Li. \"DiffScene: Diffusion-Based Safety-Critical Scenario Generation for Autonomous Vehicles.\" In The Second Workshop on New Frontiers in Adversarial Machine Learning. 2023.\n\n[2] Jiang, Chiyu, Andre Cornman, Cheolho Park, Benjamin Sapp, Yin Zhou, and Dragomir Anguelov. \"MotionDiffuser: Controllable Multi-Agent Motion Prediction using Diffusion.\" In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 9644-9653. 2023.\n\n[3] Zhong, Ziyuan, Davis Rempe, Danfei Xu, Yuxiao Chen, Sushant Veer, Tong Che, Baishakhi Ray, and Marco Pavone. \"Guided conditional diffusion for controllable traffic simulation.\" In 2023 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 3560-3566. IEEE, 2023.\n\n- This work models the problem as classifier-free guidance incorrectly. This is a classic example of a conditional diffusion, as was done by (Janner et al. 2022) with the initial state being replaced by the history of all agents as well as the map. This is even confirmed by the authors who set the bernoulli p=0.\n\n- Scene-level metrics: the results presented in Table 2 do not seem to be scene-level metrics. Details on the axis of the min should be provided. Scene level metrics (as performed by scene Transformer) measure the minimum average across all agents in a scenes, and not the average minimum across all agents. \n\n- Ablation study results are confusing to me. The results don't seem to support either claim strongly. In addition, it is unclear if the number of parameters on the right side of Figure 5 are equal across all dimensions. Furthermore, why does the minFDE seem to improve as the number of diffusion steps is reduced, except for when the diffusion steps are at 50 baseline (in Figure 5 left)?\n\n- Section 6 does not provide any results, and simply states that it is possible to generate scenes from the long-tail using such an architecture. There are no results to support this claim, as this experiment was performed on an internal dataset. I believe section 6 could/should be placed as part of the conclusion, or the experiment should be performed on a dataset like Argoverse. Also, what is meant by learning the representation of these interactive events? In addition to the results, more details on the method would be necessary, and should be presented in Section 4."
