The problem setting comes with several challenges, including how to deal with unseen objects/backgrounds, subtle behavior differences between success and failure as well as detecting failure during policy execution. \n\nThe authors propose to learn pattern flow in the policy\u2019s representation space and design novel architectures, such as a pattern extractor to extract discriminative patterns of different rollouts. It also applies several novel training tricks: rollout augmentation and temporal-aware triplet loss to stabilize training.\n\nBesides the contribution of a new method, this paper also designs new challenging FSI tasks to evaluate AED methods and baselines."

There are a couple of recent works in error detection in robot manipulation, including MoMaRT [1], ThriftyDAgger [2], and some model-based approaches [3] worth comparing.\n\n- Since both the policy and error detector are conditioned on demonstrations, it\u2019s worth seeing the performance of the error detector under different demonstration qualities. When deploying a human-robot interactive system, we should be able to separate out human error and robot error.\n\n- In the visualizations, the failure is detected after the fact (5 frames later), which is undesirable if the damage is already happened. This is expected as the design doesn\u2019t include a world model to predict possible failures.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer upjt,\n\nWe sincerely appreciate your insightful comments and positive assessments. We now address the questions and issues you raised.\n\n*The issues listed in the weaknesses and questions are denoted as Wx and Qx, respectively, where x is the issue's index.*\n\n---\n\n\n**What\u2019s the use case of the proposed system if it only detects failure after the fact? (W3, Q3)**\n\nThank you for this question.\n\nThe fundamental assumption of our work is that  we are monitoring the few-shot imitation (FSI) policies, and they usually have the following settings:\n\n- **Training and testing environments are disjoint**. (base env. vs. novel env.)\n- **No exploration** before inference in novel environments.\n- **The expert only provides demonstrations** in the novel environment but may not be around the robot when it executes.\n\nThese settings make our AED methods unable to get the information of human assistance (e.g., intervention, labeling new data) or world dynamic model as used in the references the reviewer listed. A practical scenario of our AED study is provided at the end of our response.\n\nMoreover, we are dealing with robot manipulation tasks, where the robot interacts closely with objects. Therefore, in our definition, an error (failure) occurs (right) after a failed interaction. From this moment, the current observation is inconsistent with demonstrations.\n\nIn addition, to our knowledge, most existing studies related to failure detection on robot manipulation also detect the error after the fact, e.g., the reference [1] the reviewer listed. \n\nWe are not saying that our setting is better than the one in [3], but the settings, targeted policies, and scenarios between ours and [3] are different. Thus, in our AED task, the goal is to detect the error as early as possible (after the fact). And our PrObe detects errors at the most accurate timing.\n\nRegarding the issue of delaying 5 frames, the camera collects the observations with fps=20. It means that our PrObe only causes a delay less than 0.25 seconds, which should be acceptable in practice. From our demo video, our PrObe can detect the error before the mug falls on the table. We believe the AED problem and proposed PrObe suit many real-world situations.\n\n\n**A practical scenario of our AED problem:**\n\nAn intelligent robot (containing policy and AED method) is trained in the factory with daily life tasks. Then, it is sold to the customer's house to perform those tasks. The customer will provide few demonstrations for the robot but may not stay around the robot for the whole time. The robot itself should be able to recognize if it performs the task correctly or not. Also, it should terminate the policy and wait for expert's help or apply the recovery policy (in our appendix) when it detects a behavior mismatch. Note that in this case, the expert is the customer, who can provide demonstrations but may not be able to label corrected actions for the robot.\n\n---\n\n**How does the method compare with recent papers, such as MoMaRT, ThrifyDAgger, etc.? (W1, Q1)**\n\nThank you for recommending these references.\n\nAs explained in Q3, in our setting, we don\u2019t have access to human assistance (intervention and newly labeled data) and environmental exploration before inference, which are the natural limits of the FSI literature. Therefore, the works that need human-in-the-loop (reference [2]) or the world model (reference [3]) cannot be compared with our work.\n\nThe reference [1] is already included in our references. However, as we pointed out in the Introduction, these reconstruction-based methods (one-class classification) suffer when dealing with our problem. \n\nThey monitor the policies based on the *reconstruction errors of observations*. However, they will raise errors for **every frame in the novel environments** since they did not see them before. We have tried to add [1] as one of our baselines, but we cannot find appropriate thresholds since it yields large errors no matter if the frame is normal or an error in the novel environments.\n\nMoreover, we actually build our baselines **with various attributes**, including policy dependent, OCC (trained with only normal rollouts), temporal information, and demonstration-conditioned. Please find them in Appendix Table 3. Besides, there are also powerful models in our baselines. For example, DCTED (2021) is a transformer model, which should be more complicated than cVAE used in [1].\n\nHowever, we are grateful for receiving the references related to our work. We think summarizing and introducing these interactive error detection works is valuable, even though our settings are different. **We will include them in our final paper**.\n\nPlease let us know if there is any other paper the reviewer thinks is related to us or fits our setting and should be compared.\n\nThank you again for suggesting the references.\n\n---\n\nPlease find the rest of our response below."

(W1, Q2)**\n\nThanks for the question. \n\nOur PrObe is an AED method (i.e., adaptable error detector, denoted as $\\phi$ in Figure 2), which involves the phases of AED training and AED inference.\n\nThe framework of our AED problem contains three phases:\n- **Policy training phase:** The few-shot imitation policy $\\pi$  first trains on the base environments. \n- **AED training phase:** The AED methods also train on the base environments. In this phase, some methods, e.g., our PrObe, might leverage the knowledge from the trained policy.\n- **AED inference phase:** The trained policy $\\pi$ performs the FSI tasks in novel environments. AED methods aim to monitor the policy and report timely once the policy behavior error occurs, i.e., the policy rollout is inconsistent with demonstrations provided by the expert in the novel environments. \n\nThus, all AED methods involve the last two phases of Figure 2; however, our PrObe can tackle the challenging AED problem with superior performance. We will make this more clear in the revised version. \n\nBesides, please note that the FSI tasks are semantically similar in the base and novel environments (e.g., both are pick&place tasks). However, the interactable objects and backgrounds are disjoint between them. \n\n**A practical scenario of our AED problem:**\n\nAn intelligent robot (containing policy and AED method) is trained in the factory with daily life tasks. Then, it is sold to the customer's house to perform those tasks. The customer will provide few demonstrations for the robot but may not stay around the robot for the whole time. The robot itself should be able to recognize if it performs the task correctly or not. Also, it should terminate the policy and wait for expert's help or apply the recovery policy (in our appendix) when it detects a behavior mismatch.\n\n---\n\n**What's the relationship between Eq. 1, 2 and 3? (W1, Q2)**\n\nThanks for the question. \n\nEq. 1 and 2 are the formal representations of how the AED method predicts the error status and how they will be evaluated.\n\n- Eq. 1: The AED method $\\phi$ takes rollout history (observations) $h$ and few demonstrations $\\mathcal{D}^{n}$ as inputs and then predicts the error status $\\hat{y}$.\n- Eq. 2: The AED method is evaluated by its prediction $\\hat{y}$ and ground-truth $y$ across all novel environments.\n\nEq. 3 is a new objective we proposed to train the PrObe, which is a temporal-aware variant of triplet loss. The complete objectives of PrObe can be found in Appendix Section B.\n\n---\n\n**Why do we choose these operations and probabilities in our designed rollout augmentation (RA)? (Q1)**\n\nGood question. \n\nAs mentioned in the main paper's Section 5.1, the four operations (keep, drop, copy, and swap) can inject **different behaviors** into the pre-collected rollouts during the AED training phase.\n\n- **Dropping** consecutive frames can *speed up* the movements.\n- **Copying** consecutive frames can *slow down* the movements.\n- **Swapping** consecutive frames can provide *unsmooth* movements.\n\nMoreover, the copy operation could be replaced by the interpolation operation. We have tested this replacement, but no significant performance difference is observed. Meanwhile, the interpolation operation is very time-consuming. Thus, we still apply the four operations above.\n\nRegarding determining their probabilities (0.3, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2), we observe that the policy usually *behaves faster* than the pre-collected rollouts. Thus, we would like to have a higher chance of generating speeded-up rollouts during training. \n\nNevertheless, the probabilities can be easily adjusted to cover more diverse rollout behaviors, which may benefit the AED training. If the reviewer wants to try any combination of the probabilities, we would love to verify it. \n\nHowever, the AED methods' performance is not sensitive to the probability setting, as we tested before.\n\n---\n\nPlease let us know if our responses have addressed your questions and issues. \n\nBesides, feel free to point out if there is any other issue or topic you are interested in or think will make our work more convincing.\nWe look forward to having active and insightful discussions with you!\n\nThanks again for providing valuable comments."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer Zod3,\n\nWe respectfully disagree with your assessment. \n\nWe will address the raised concerns now, and look forward to having a constructive conversation with you.\n\n*The issues listed in the weaknesses and questions are denoted as Wx and Qx, respectively, where x is the issue's index.*\n\n---\n\n**The problem and its challenges itself are unclear. What does \"No impulse signals in behavior errors\" mean? (W1)**\n\nWe propose a new problem named adaptable error detection (AED), which aims to detect the behavior inconsistency between the few-shot imitation policy rollouts and demonstrations.\n\nThe proposed AED contains three challenges, which makes it more challenging than an existing video few-shot anomaly detection problem. The second challenge, \u201cno impulse signals in behavior errors,\u201d means no significant difference between the consecutive frames when the error happens. We also provide two cases with detailed visual explanations in Figure 1. \n\nIt is worth mentioning that all other reviewers agree **our proposed AED problem is crucial** for robot learning when considering the safety perspective.\n\n---\n\n**Presentation Issues (W1, W5)**\n\nWe are perplexed about these issues. \n\nFor W1, there are only three new abbreviations in our paper, i.e., AED for adaptable error detection, PrObe for Pattern Observer, and vFSAD for video few-shot anomaly detection.\n\nAll remaining abbreviations are well-known or the method names from existing literature. For example, OCC for one-class classification, OOD for out-of-distribution, or DC for demonstration-conditioned. Also, we usually write the full name of the abbreviation at the beginning of each section if it does not frequently appear.\n\nFor W5, we do not find any inappropriateness when emphasizing the importance of our work since we propose a new problem in this paper. Most importantly, the two cases the reviewer mentioned are not even our proposed problem. Instead, they are the two problems related to us. We state the fact that they are relatively new and have drawn the researcher's attention recently.\n\nAt last, we want to highlight that we got >= 3 presentation scores from all other reviewers. We would appreciate it if the reviewer could point out which parts of the paper are unclear so that we can further improve it.\n\n---\n\n**The papers make many claims without supporting evidence, e.g. \"We emphasize that addressing AED is as critical as enhancing FSI policies\u2019 performance\". (W2)**\n\nIt is the motivation of our work, which we spent **more than 13 lines** (first two paragraphs of Introduction) to describe the situation that the few-shot imitation policies may provoke damage when applying them to real-world scenarios. Thus, we should also consider promoting their ability for safety executions rather than the performance of their own tasks (e.g., manipulation tasks). \n\nWe believe this motivation is clearly presented, which all other reviewers recognize.\n\nWe would appreciate it if the reviewer could point out other unsupported claims or motivations we made in the paper. We would love to explain or improve it.\n\n---\n\n**Works related to OOD detection in time-series data should be compared. (W3)**\n\nThank you for pointing out this question.\n\nThe fundamental assumption of our work is that we are monitoring the few-shot imitation (FSI) policies, and they usually have the following settings:\n\n- **Training and testing environments are disjoint**. (base env. vs. novel env.)\n- **No exploration before inference** in novel environments.\n- **The expert only provides demonstrations** in the novel environment but may not be around the robot when it executes.\n\nThus, the traditional methods on OOD detection in time-series data are unavailable. In our case, the error detector works in an unseen environment. And we only have few demonstrations in the environment which makes it hard to compute those p-values in the reference [1] or other information in the frequency space. \n\nMoreover, the OOD samples defined in our work is the inconsistency between the policy rollout and demonstrations, which have two time-series. The OOD samples can be only detected by comparing these two video streams rather than simply computed on any one of them.\n\nThe vFSAD problem is the most related problem we can find. But our problem raises more challenges than the vFSAD problem, as we stated in the Introduction.\n\nPlease let us know if there is any other paper the reviewer thinks is related to us or fits our setting and should be compared.\n\nThank you again for suggesting the reference.\n\n---\n\nPlease find the rest of our response below."

                        "value": "My concerns beyond the writing have been addressed by the authors response and my (fifth!) rereading of the paper. Perhaps my initial rating was a bit harsh, and hence, I've amended my rating to a 5 (although I am leaning towards 3). The problem is novel. The FSI tasks to evaluate Probe are comprehensive. But, since I believe that the writing needs a big update to be suitable for ICLR (and that has not been done so far by the authors), I am not recommending an accept considering the significant effort required by anyone to parse the first half (before experiments) of the paper."
