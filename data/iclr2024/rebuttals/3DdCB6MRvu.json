The proposed model consists of a conditional NeRF generator, two discriminators, and a data augmentation technique to address data scarcity. This approach has the potential to reduce both the complexity and cost associated with scST studies."

Both the paper and the appendix lack a clear description of scST technology and a problem formulation that the approach aims to solve.\n\n3. The experimental evaluation does not adequately support the application of the proposed method. It is tested only on the axolotl telencephalon dataset, raising questions about its generalizability. Moreover, the paper does not compare the proposed method with any baseline methods.\n\n4. Section 3.1 omits crucial details, such as the number of images in the generated dataset.\n\n5. The literature review could be improved by offering a more comprehensive overview of NeRF-based methods used in biological or medical image reconstruction tasks.\n\n6. The caption of Figure 1 is unclear, as it does not specify which \"both methods\" it refers to.\n\nDue to the ambiguity surrounding the problem being addressed and the absence of baseline comparisons, it is hard to determine the contribution of this work. The reported experimental results seem insufficient. These are the primary reasons I am inclined to recommend rejection."

Would the authors be able to present a detailed problem formulation, which should ideally be placed at the beginning or before the method section?"

Their experiments focus on the Axolotl Telencephalon Stereo-Seq dataset, which is very limited in scope - it has smaller spots compared to 10x Visium, but still cannot be considered as single cell resolution compared to techniques like MERFISH or 10x Xenium.\n- Although authors have employed several computer vision techniques in the paper applied to ST data, there is very limited technical novelty in the paper that makes it suitable for an ICLR submission (may be better suited for several other computer vision/ computational biology conferences)."

With various components, very limited training data and the GAN, mode collapse might be an issue. The authors should provide the average reconstruction results across multiple runs for reproducibility. \n- The codebase is not available - making it open-source would help with reproducibility efforts."

The generative model proposed is trained with 2 discriminator functions. The discriminator for real/fake image and discriminator for real/fake image/expression and cell type paired data. The later, ensures that there is alignment between the generated images and corresponding semantic labels (i.e. gene expression maps and cell types).

In Figure 3, the prediction and ground truth look very different. In the semantic images one can visually see many mistakes. The results don't look very reliable. Also it doesn't look like individual cell coordinates can be inferred.\n2. The function T is used twice with different meanings, as NeRF transmittance function and as augmentation function. This makes it is confusing to understand the method equations.\n3. The authors mention that previous methods predict coordinates. However, they do not compare the coordinates dervied from their predictions to previous methods.\n\nQuestions:\n1. A NeRF model is usually fit on a specific scene. Does that mean that for every scan a new model need to be generated? What is the training time per model?\n2. The camera pos for 3D tissue reconstruction is different from 3D natural scenes. How is the camera pos sampled? What are the parameters that vary, is it only depth? Are the real views modified in any way to vary camera pos?\n3. What is the total dimension of the ground truth data and the training and test data? How many 3D reconstructions were used in the evaluation and How many slices?\n4. The authors mention that they need less than 10 slices. To be able to reconstruct the scene, were the training slices distributed in a specific way?\n5. In Fig 2, the data augmentation function T seems to be only appliced on the fake data. Why is that?\n6. What is the function fe in equations 14 and 15?\n7. During training, is there a ground truth that the output is compared against or only the real/fake discriminators? If yes, which equation corresponds to that and what is the loss function used?\n8. In the sentence \"synthesizes novel views for single-cell spatial transcriptomics from a set of unposed ssDNA images.\". what does 'unposed' mean? If there is no position info then how is camera pos is selected?\n\n\nMinor:\n  - The following sentence needs to be fixed \"(including, Staining Images are often referred to as ssDNA, Sequecial images)\""
