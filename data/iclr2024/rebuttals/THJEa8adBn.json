The main contribution of the paper is the algorithm called GLOW which provides polynomial sample complexity bounds in the online RL setting by minimizing the weighted average Bellman error using clipped density ratios along with realizability assumptions in function approximation. To further improve the sample efficiency, authors propose a meta-algorithm H2O that can reuse any offline algorithm to output an online exploration policy in the Hybrid RL setting (i.e. online RL with some available offline data). \n\n\n\n*I would also like to note here that I am perhaps not the target audience of this work and though I am aware of some of the related works on this topic, I may not be the best judge of this paper's contributions.*"

We reply to their questions and comments below. \n\n>While the paper focuses on providing theoretical bounds regarding sample efficiency of the proposed algorithms, it lacks any attempts at empirical verification of the same.\n\nAs the reviewer recognized, this is a theoretical paper, with a focus on getting a statistically efficient algorithm for the online RL setting under only realizability-type assumptions. We believe these theoretical contributions alone are sufficient for publication. Our results for the Hybrid RL setting do provide some computational efficiency results, however few RL algorithms with rigorous guarantees can be implemented as-is in complex environments, and often need nontrivial adaptations to implement (e.g. the practical algorithm for HyQ given in Algorithm 3 in Song. et. al. 2022 [1] is quite different from its theoretical version given in Algorithm 1).\n\n > Comparing to Song et al. which the authors highlight for introducing the Hybrid RL setting, I would expect similar experiments (eg. Song et al. present experimental results in Montezuma's revenge) in this paper to demonstrate the performance of the theoretically motivated framework in practice.\n\nWhile the paper of Song et al. 2022 was entirely focused on the hybrid RL setting and on demonstrating that hybrid RL can be computationally efficient, by contrast we have focused on providing both statistical results in the online setting and computational results in the hybrid setting. Thus, we consider the empirical implementation of HyGlow out of the scope of our current work. We are optimistic that our HyGlow algorithm will work similarly to the HyQ algorithm of Song. et. al. 2022, although verifying this in practice is left for future research. \n\n> Perhaps it would also help to include a discussion of the practicality of the assumptions made in the theoretical proofs\n\nTheoretically, our assumptions are quite general and capture many prior settings (see Appendix B and D.1). We also argue that we can expect them to hold in reasonable practical problems via the following heuristic argument. The coverability assumption states that there exists some unknown data distribution which provides coverage over our policy set. Should we be provided with this distribution, offline RL algorithms are known to work in conjunction with our function approximation assumptions. Thus, when our assumptions do not hold, this states that offline RL can not solve this MDP under any possible training distribution (even the most favorable one). This indicates that if the coverability assumption does not hold, the MDP is \u201cdegenerate\u201d in the sense that sampling data from any possible data distribution and training on that data will always fail. We will expand the discussion in the text on the practicality of our assumptions.\n\n>In the first line on page 4, \"that d^\u03c0/ d^{\u03c0\u2032} for all ...\", is there some missing text after d^\u03c0/d^{\u03c0\u2032}?\n\nWe have fixed the typo, thank you for pointing it out. It should have said \u201cwe require realizability of $d^\\pi_h/d^{\\pi\u2019}_h$ for all $\\pi, \\pi\u2019 \\in \\Pi$.\u201d\n\nReferences:\n[1] Song, Yuda, Yifei Zhou, Ayush Sekhari, J.

We reply to their questions and comments below. \n\n> Bypassing the need for strong completeness-type assumptions by introducing an additional density ratio realizability assumption is not a novel approach, particularly in the context of offline reinforcement learning [...]. So the results in this work are not very surprising.\n\nWe disagree with the claim that our results are not very surprising. The reviewer seems to be glancing over the distinction between online RL and offline RL. As we have discussed in the text, density ratios have indeed appeared and been fruitful in offline RL:  \u201cNotably, a promising emerging paradigm in offline RL makes use of the ability to model density ratios [...] for the underlying MDP.\u201d (pg 1). However, in offline RL, the learner is provided with a dataset that by assumption has good coverage properties. This assumption is essential to the very existence of density ratios.  The key challenge in adopting these methods for online RL is that one is not given such a dataset and any dataset collected via exploration can not be assumed to have good coverage. Dealing with these issues requires us to introduce novel algorithmic ideas and new analysis techniques. To our knowledge, our paper is the *only* work that shows that density ratios have provable benefits in online RL. \n\n> Dentity-based algorithms may not be as suitable for online reinforcement learning, given the perceived strength of Assumption 2.2. While the authors have included two examples in Appendix D.1, these examples are already familiar to us and do not pose a significant challenge.\n\nWe would like to push back on the notion that density ratios are not suitable for online RL. In particular, our setting subsumes many specific examples that satisfy our realizability assumptions and could not be captured by prior work. To this end, we disagree with the claim that \u201cthese examples are familiar and do not pose a challenge\u201d: Example D.2 is novel \u2013 we show for the first time that we can address the problem of rich observation RL when the latent MDP is coverable, and in which we only make assumptions about the latent function classes. In particular, this setting is not guaranteed to satisfy the Bellman completeness assumption used in Xie et al. (2023) (notably, completeness in latent space does not imply completeness in observation space), and hence is out of the reach of prior work. We are happy to expand the discussion around the novelty of Example D.2 in the final version of the paper.\nRegarding the strength of assumption 2.2, we believe that the reviewer is referring to our need to realize the density ratios for all pairs of policies. We remark that this assumption is weaker than needing to realize the density ratios between all policies and any reference distribution (Remark B.2 in the appendix).  In addition, note that in the online RL setting, a coverability assumption with respect to only a single policy (e.g. pi^\\star) is easily seen to be useless (this assumption would state that there exists an unknown distribution which covers pi^\\star, which is always trivially satisfied by the distribution for pi^\\star itself). \n\n>  If the authors could provide additional examples, such as those involving low (Bellman) eluder dimension or bilinear class, it would make the results more remarkable.\n\nThe low Bellman eluder dimension condition and the bilinear class condition are orthogonal to our setting. That is, they do not imply and are not implied by coverability + our realizability assumptions (this is discussed in Appendix B, as well as in the prior work [1]). \n\nReferences:\n[1] Tengyang Xie, Dylan J Foster, Yu Bai, Nan Jiang, and Sham M Kakade.

                    "value": "The convergence of offline and online reinforcement learning theories has led to the emergence of density ratio modeling in offline RL. However, this concept has been absent in online RL due to the challenge of collecting a comprehensive exploratory dataset. This paper introduces GLOW, an online RL algorithm that can explore and learn efficiently when there is an exploratory distribution with good coverage (coverability condition), even in the presence of value functions and density ratios. GLOW handles unbounded density ratios through truncation and employs optimism for exploration, but it is computationally inefficient. To address this, a more efficient variant called HYGLOW is introduced for Hybrid RL, combining online RL with offline data. HYGLOW is derived from a meta-algorithm called $H_2O$, which offers a provable reduction from hybrid RL to offline RL."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their positive comments and for their feedback. We reply to their questions and comments below. \n\n>  \u2026it's worth noting that GLOW is computationally inefficient. Therefore, there is a need to develop more computationally efficient variants to showcase the algorithm's practical effectiveness.\n\nWe believe that our statistical efficiency results on their own are a contribution which merits acceptance. Statistical considerations preclude computational ones, and a major contribution of our work is to establish for the first time that the use of density ratios in online RL is viable and worthy of further study (including computational questions). Computational inefficiency is overwhelmingly common for online RL algorithms under general function approximation (e.g. OLIVE [1], GOLF [2], BiLin-UCB [3], etc.), and our work builds on this line of research, though deriving an efficient counterpart to our algorithm is of course a fascinating direction for future research.\n\nTowards bridging this gap, we also provided new results for the Hybrid RL setting (Section 4) which do yield a computationally efficient version of GLOW, under the additional assumption that the learner has access to both offline datasets and online interactions. In this setting, we can remove the optimism step, which is the only computationally intensive component of our algorithm. \n\nA computationally efficient algorithm in the fully online setting would require algorithmic ideas beyond optimism (e.g. policy covers). These exist in simpler settings (namely tabular and linear MDPs) but are not known to work in the general setting of coverability with arbitrary function classes. \n\n> However, I am still curious about the specific benefits for online RL. Does it enlarge range of MDPs which can be solved by online RL algorithms (it may be computationally inefficient)?\n\nYes, this does indeed enlarge the class of MDPs which we can solve in online RL. Specifically, this is the first provable sample complexity guarantee for coverable MDPs that does not rely on the Bellman Completeness assumption, which was specifically mentioned as an open problem in Xie et al. 2023 [4]. In Appendix D.1 we also provide some more specific examples of new MDP classes that can be solved by our algorithm and which were not previously known to be tractable.\n\nReferences:\n[1] Jiang N, Krishnamurthy A, Agarwal A, Langford J, Schapire RE.
