Regarding the literature review, it would help to have a clear definition of the problem (even informal) to understand the differences and similarities with what has been proposed in the literature.\n\nMoreover, it is not clear why you decided to include the two lemmas in the main paper. Please add some comments or move them into the supplementary material.\n\nIf the derivation of the two results (Theorem 1 and 2) is significantly different, you should point out the elements of the proof that differ the most.\n\nHow does the theoretical result relate to the ones present in the literature (for similar settings)?\n\nRegarding Figure, for no-regret algorithms, we should have that the curves are going to zero, but it would be hard to see this phenomenon. I would have divided the order of the bounds to show that the bounds are correct. \n\nMore comments on the results are required.

Please, comment on this aspect.\n- \"This choice is logical ...\" I think that the explanation here is too simplistic. Please, provide more evidence fot your choice.\n- Some of the assumptions are related to the problem, so they should be moved to the problem formulation. Others are related to the modeling approach you choose. These are not assumption but design choices for the algorithm you propose.\n- It would be better to generalize Lemma2 and Lemma3 into a single lemma.\n- You should also add some comment on the definition of n'_\\delta\n- it is somehow strange that you define a constant that is dependent on the time horizon N. I think you should remove the dependence from N to better highligh the dependence on the different parts of the regret from the time horizon N.\n- It seems that setting the \\pi_n sequence requires the modulus of continuity of the real function? Is it true? What if we do not have such an information on the true function?\n- \"Note that it is relevant ...\" This comment should be moved to the introduction to better motivate the setting you are studying.\n-"

The authors delve deep into the realm of nonparametric contextual bandits that deal with delayed rewards. The paper introduces two different strategies for the $\\epsilon$-greedy type allocation methods, each differing in how they adjust the exploration rate based on delays. By adopting the Nadaraya-Watson estimator for estimating mean reward functions, the strategies factor in unbounded random delays. The key contribution of the paper is the presentation of finite-time regret upper bounds for these strategies. In the backdrop of a comprehensive literature review on standard and contextual bandits with delayed rewards, the authors highlight the novelty of their work. Notably, this is the first instance where regret bounds for $\\epsilon$-greedy in nonparametric bandits with delayed feedback are presented. From a practical standpoint, the authors propose data-driven methods to choose between the two strategies, ensuring that the most advantageous approach is selected based on the situation."
