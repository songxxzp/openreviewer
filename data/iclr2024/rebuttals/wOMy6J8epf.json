They discuss a case study of crowding in a train station, for which data is generated using a large number of agent-based simulations under different control settings. The authors use Logic Learning Machine (LLM) to evaluate different interpretable rules based on an SVDD classifier trained on the simulated data. Then they rank the features according to this LLM analysis and finally identify the optimal set of features to change, to achieve the objective (i.e. convert a situation from \"high crowding\" to \"low crowding\")"

By changing the values of these variables that are on of general, passenger-related or train-related, the study produces counterfactual scenarios that change from congested to uncongested conditions and vice versa. Results suggest general agreement between predictions and expert opinions."

Indicatively, the main variables are described in the 1-page appendix.\n- The results seem preliminary and there are no signs of generalization beyond the current setting.\n- From the current exposition, the exact technical contribution of the paper, if any, was unclear to me. It seems that the paper uses existing techniques (e.g., pre-trained LLM models), in a specific application. A large part of the paper is devoted to explaining things from the literature that are already known."

My suggestion to the authors is to significantly improve the presentation and provide rigorous justifications for the background and steps used in it. E.g., the questionnaires are not available, the architecture of the code is not clear (even if the code cannot be disclosed due to anonymity) etc. Further, I suggest the focus to be on the novel methodological and conceptual contributions of the paper in a way that is transparent to the readers rather than on spending so much time on known things (e.g., precision and recall). Finally, the background and choices need to be specified accurately. Currently, we don't have much intuition about the simulation environment and the choices made for the parameters. E.g., in page 3 we read \"Based on the available data,...\" but it is unclear where this data refers to. If it is the simulation data, then, it is not justified why this distribution was chosen. The tables are hard to parse, with captions that don't explain the results, and no highlights (e.g., bold letters) in important findings. \n\nFinally, it seems to me that since there are no methodological contributions, even if the above set of improvements is implemented, the paper is not a good fit for ICLR."

                    "value": "My major concerns are with the contributions and the presentation of the paper. It reads like a course report rather than a quality research paper.\n \n1. The claimed contribution in combining the two methods seem invalid to me. Essentially, there are two separate tasks (feature selection and counterfactual) and the two methods are used for them separately. To obtain counterfactual explanations, a different ML model (SVDD) is trained to predict the crowding. The two tasks and the two methods are only loosely connected under the same big problem.\n\n2. The authors do not provide sufficient justification why the specific methods are needed and suitable for the underlying problem.\n- Why do you adopt this particular rule based model not other models? You mentioned in Section 4.1 that others used tree-based ensemble methods. Why don't you use these methods?  It seems that LASSO or other methods are also explainable and can serve the feature selection tasks.\n- Why do you need a transparent model? Evaluation by experts mostly justified the correctness of the feature selection but did not jusitify the need for a transparent explainable model. It looks that a deep black-box model can replace the rule based model without affecting any  further discussion.\n- The counterfactual C was counter-intuitive as rated by the experts which weaken the interpretability of the model, yet the authors does not provide convincing reasons how to act on this problem. It is also unclear from the evaulation from experts whether the XAI stands out compared to other non-interpretable AI methods.\n\n3. The details of simulation are missing, and the claimed significance through simulated data is doubted. It seems that there are a lot of specifications beind the scenes. How do you generate the variables? Why do you run 12696 simulations? Do you simulate the trains as agents or other type of objects? Why is your simulation good enough to replicate the scenarios in the real station? Why the other 21 variables are not meaningful to the counterfactual analysis?\n\n4. The paper is poorly written. \n- The authors spend pages to discuss well-established methods without any claimed novelty. \n- The tables are meaningless: for example it is unclear what the authors want to convey through Table 4; the values of variables are not interesting to the audience because they are specific to the simulated problem. \n- The interpretation of results are weak. For example, the covering looked not high and error not low, as displayed in Table 2. Do these numbers jusitfy the claimed performance? Similarly, are the accuracies in Table 1 the best we can achieve?\n\n\nLastly, I agree on most of the limitations that the authors identified themselves and I believe these limitations should be addressed before the paper is complete for submission."

Or it oversimplified the problem.\n\n2. Is the dataset too simplified to demonstrate the power of XAI? Can your methodology be easily extended to similar problems with more dimensions of complexity? \n\n3.  The title mentioned \"prevent crowding\" yet no real action is provided. How does the counterfactual translates to the real decisions that can prevent the crowdedness? Did you do subsequent simulation that confirm the preventing power?"
