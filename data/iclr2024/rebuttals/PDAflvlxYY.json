For instance, what is the performance of behavioral cloning without a decision transformer?\n2. Figure 3 seems to show sample efficiency, however prior work are shown as flat lines. Why is this?\n3. What is the statistical significance of this method compared to alternative methods? I am not sure how to interpret Table 2. For instance, sorcerer has a best score of 124 but a standard deviation of 90.6. What happens to this standard deviation when averaging in Figure 3? Are the performance gains statistically significant?"

In the offline setting this challenge is alleviated because they are given at least 1 good trajectory and many partially good trajectories. This difference in difficulty is likely significant. It would be great if they could compare to some other offline methods, like filtered BC or [ILQL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11871), trained on the same dataset.\n\nNitpicks:\n* The statement \u201c[offnline RL] is more difficult than online RL\u201d is not necessarily true if your dataset is really good for example, then online RL will have many more challenges with exploration to catch up. Offline RL presents different challenges, but it is not fair to say that offline RL is strictly more difficult.\n* \"we convert distributions over discrete token representations of goal conditions into continuous ones\": this statement was confusing to me because the distribution is still intently discrete after your exponential tilting."

The training adopts the offline paradigm, where it samples trajectories by performing variation upon the max-human-score trajectory for each game. Two main adaptation is proposed during the process: 1) the goal scores are predicted (sampled with exponential tilting) in the learning sequence, and different strategies for goal conditioning are experimented; 2) an auxiliary task to predict next state is added. Empirical results on five Jericho games provide analysis on the impact of each proposed adaptation, and show that the offline models perform better than previous online RL approaches."

The exponential tilting is also trivial to perform. Overall, this work focuses on the adaptation and its analysis, without bringing enough technical contributions.\n  \n- For the evaluation, there should be thorough comparison between the proposed offline training versus the online RL training. Since for the offline data generation, random variation is performed on the trajectory with the highest human scores, the distribution of the sampled trajectories may not reflect the real distribution as online exploration, thus it is not fair to simply compare online vs. offline by Figure 3, and the success of the offline model may rely more on the data generation, rather than the approach itself. There are not enough analysis provided comparing the generated offline data with online data."
