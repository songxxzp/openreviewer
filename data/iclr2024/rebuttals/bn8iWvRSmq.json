Further, it can be shown theoretically that the nonlinearity of reward can be pushed in the features provided that the features are rich enough, which is largely the case in our framework, as the features are also generated by a pretrained LM. Therefore, while generally the linearity constraint is expected to degrade the quality of value functions, as it is also evident from Table 1 & 2, rectification with SF is on par with the RECT method, which does not use a linear reward.\n\n2. __\"Not as performant as state-of-the-art methods like RECT for single dimension control.\"__\nThe claim of this paper is *not* to achieve better performance than RECT, rather is to enable multi-subject control with almost-zero additional computational overhead as compared to RECT, while achieving comparable performance. This is accomplished through the use of successor features, which effectively separate the dynamics of language from task-specific rewards.\n\n3. __\"Limited analysis of how it handles multiple simultaneous control dimensions.\"__\nIn response to your comment, we would like to direct your attention to Section 5.1 of our paper. In this section, we have specifically focused on analyzing the performance of our method when it comes to the fusion of multiple subjects. This analysis is designed to demonstrate how our approach effectively manages multiple control dimensions in a cohesive manner. The results show that our method is capable of handling complex control scenarios where multiple dimensions are combined."

The experimental results on two CTG tasks primarily demonstrate its great performance when compared to other baselines, while maintaining high efficiency. Specifically, in comparison to other methods, the advantage of introducing SFs in this task is evident in its efficiency due to being retraining-free and having lower inference costs (see Strength.2 for more details). In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\n\n1. Building upon previous research that framed LM's generation within the RL framework (Cao et al., 2023), this paper is the first to explore SFs in this research domain and to design a plausible SF-based CTG generation framework.\n\n2. The method introduced in this paper sheds light on the efficiency in the design of CTG tasks, which represents a valuable contribution to GreenNLP."

Although GPT4ALL-J is used for prompting experiments, the authors might consider exploring more application scenarios for large LMs. I acknowledge that not all of the CTG paper ought to chase popular large LMs, it is essential to ensure that the claims made regarding large LMs, such as those found in the abstract, are adequately supported through experiments involving large LMs.\n3. **Literature review**: Notably, recent parameter-efficient transfer learning methods [1] are used in multi-subject CTG [2]. The authors may consider discussing this paradigm within the paper.\n4. **Clarity**: Several typos and clarity issues are present in the paper:\n   - The abbreviation \"Eq X\" is used alongside \"Equation X\" (page 7) in this paper. It is advisable to standardize the expression.\n   - In Section 3: \"The state $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$ consists of the prompt and the concatenation of the previously generated tokens.\" However, it is worth noting that some pre-trained LMs may not take the prompt as their input. The definition of the prompt should be clarified.\n   - In Section 3.3, while \"SARSA\" is a well-known concept, the authors should consider citing relevant literature when mentioning it in this paper for the first time.\n   - In Section 3.4, \"Laroche et al. (2017)).\" should be corrected to \"Laroche et al.

                        "value": "Thank you for your feedback!\n\n## Weakness\n__\"The performance of the proposed method may not be excellent when compared to existing baselines, especially for RECT...\"__\n\nAs you noted, our method's performance, when compared to RECT, may not appear exceptional at first glance. However, it's important to underline that the primary claim of our paper is not to surpass RECT in terms of performance. Instead, our focus is on enabling multi-subject control with minimal additional computational overhead when compared to RECT, while still maintaining performance that is largely on par.\nTo achieve this, we employed successor features in our method, which play a crucial role in our approach. These features effectively disentangle the dynamics of language from task-specific rewards, allowing for more versatile control without significant computational cost. This aspect, we believe, is a substantial contribution to the field, offering a novel approach to multi-subject control in language-based tasks.\nMoreover, as mentioned in Section 5.2, our method demonstrates efficiency in terms of inference time, which is a significant consideration in real-world applications. We propose that this efficiency, coupled with the comparable performance to RECT and the unique advantage of almost-zero additional computational overhead for multi-subject control, underscores the practical value of our work.\nWe will make sure to highlight these points more explicitly in the revised manuscript to ensure that the readers fully grasp the significance and novelty of our approach, beyond the traditional performance metrics.\n\n__\"Claims: While the authors mention the application of large LMs in this paper, the main experiments and analysis primarily focus on previous pre-trained LM...\"__\n\nWe appreciate your insights and agree that a broader exploration of different LLMs could further strengthen the claims we made about LLMs. We would like to clarify why we chose GPT4ALL-J for our experiments. The primary reason for this selection is its shared vocabulary with the GPT-2 model, which is a requirement for our approach (the policy model and value function should have the same action space). Evaluation results on common sense reasoning benchmarks show that GPT4ALL-J demonstrated performance comparable to LLaMA. Furthermore, regarding the prompting experiments, we also tested the LLaMA model. Interestingly, we observed that LLaMA's performance in prompting detoxification (with a toxicity score of 60.82) was not as effective as GPT4ALL-J's (which scored 56.13). This comparison underscores the relevance of our findings and shows that the results from GPT4ALL-J can be generalized to other LLMs. In light of your feedback, we plan to extend our research further to include a wider range of LLMs in future studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the application scenarios for LLMs.\n\n__\"Literature Review & Clarity\"__\n\nThank you for highlighting the missing literature and typos. We will address these issues in the next version of the paper.\n\n## Questions\n1. __\"Section 3.2: How can Eq 10 be simplified to match Eq 3? Is the focus of this simplification on $r_w(s,a,s')$ in Eq 2?\"__\nFirst, we wish to clarify that Eq 10 represents the combined reward as a weighted sum of subject-level rewards, which aligns directly with the formulation in Eq 3. Therefore, no further simplification between these two equations is necessary.\nMoreover, we would like to point out that Eq 10 is a naive approach by simply taking the average of the rewards. As discussed in our paper, this naive approach is problematic since it is insufficient to satisfy the security condition (i.e., Eq 1) for each individual subject as their corresponding rewards are diluted. To address this, we adopt a different strategy, as detailed in Eq 12, where we use the minimum of the action-value functions for each subject.\n\n\n2. __\"Section 3.3: $\\phi$ is parameterized by the output of the final layer of pre-trained LMs. Have the differences between various networks been compared? Is there an exploration of whether simpler networks can achieve similar effectiveness?\"__\nIn our research, we chose to parameterize $\\phi$ using the outputs from the final layer of pre-trained language models (LMs) primarily due to their proven effectiveness in feature extraction for language-related tasks. The representation provided by these LMs is essential for our methodology, as it allows a linear regression model to accurately recover terminal rewards. \nWhile it is theoretically possible to derive $\\phi$ from any feature extractor, we think that non-pretrained models, or simpler networks, may not provide the same level of effectiveness. This is primarily due to their limited ability to capture the intricate semantics of generated sentences. Therefore, we did not explore simpler networks for $\\phi$ computation, as pre-trained LMs already established a strong baseline in terms of natural language understanding."

Rather, the main contribution is to have a dynamic fusion with nearly zero computational overhead as well as comparable performance/accuracy. This is accomplished through the use of successor features, which effectively separate the dynamics of language from task-specific rewards. \n\n## Questions\n1. __\"In the analysis of combining reward parameters in 5.1, at maximum 3 reward parameters are combined. What if more are added?\"__\nSF will have the capacity to model them all since successor features are fully decoupled from rewards. From the SF side, it does not matter if there is only one or many subjects. No problem there. Please see the discussion of Section 3.5 (and equation 12, which is how the values are combined). Mathematically, there is **no problem at all** to add as many reward channels as one requires. Computationally, it is not a problem either, since each reward only adds **one row** to the matrix multiplication, happening after the successor features are acquired (i.e., only one forward pass from the SF network is required, regardless of the number of rewards/subjects). \nHowever, while there is no problem from the SF viewpoint, one should note that adding **too many subjects** concurrently may defeat the purpose of language generation, as the possibility of cutting too much from the LLM\u2019s generated probability will increase. Mathematically, if infinite diverse subjects are added, then the \u201caugmented LLM\u201d will produce a uniform policy (i.e., not selective). The reason is that under way too many subjects, each token could be a bad choice for at least one of them, hence it cannot be preferred, leaving no preference at all. A good practice here can be to prioritize subjects and only keep maximum $M$ subjects at a time, where $M$ largely depends on the properties of the underlying LLM. We should also note that, in our experiments we did not observe such pathological cases while we tried three subjects concurrently. \n\n2. __\"What\u2019s the main rationale for focusing on GPT-2 XL? Would you expect the observation being different when the base LM is switched to a different one from another family (e.g. Llama) or a different scale?\"__\nWe use GPT2-large as the policy model for the sentiment control and detoxification experiment. GPT2-XL is used for perplexity evaluation. The focus on the GPT LM family in our paper is primarily due to its widespread popularity in the NLP research community. This popularity makes it easier to compare our results with existing baselines, which predominantly use the GPT as their base model. Additionally, our method requires that the base language model and the action-value function share the same action space, which in this context means they must have the same vocabulary. The GPT family of models, including GPT-2 small, GPT-2 large, GPT-2 XL, and GPT-J share the same tokenizer, fulfilling this requirement. While we have concentrated on the GPT family for these reasons, we believe that our approach would be equally applicable to other LM families, such as Llama."

However, a potential issue is the typical requirement for retraining LLMs when there is a shift in the control target. To address this, the authors introduce SF-GEN, a method built upon two primary concepts: successor features (SFs) and language model rectification. SF-GEN, following the reinforcement learning (RL) framework for text generation, employs SFs to reduce the complexity of Q-value calculations. Meanwhile, SF-GEN seeks to address challenges associated with the application of SFs to text generation, such as the derivation of the Bellman equation, the interdependency of the value function and task-specific rewards, and the expansive action space. Besides, SF-GEN facilitates the concurrent control of multiple aspects by integrating various reward parameters. Comparative experiments conducted in text generation for sentiment control and detoxification show the superiority of SF-GEN over baselines and most current methods with respect to performance, memory efficiency, and computational speed. Subsequent analysis verifies the advantages of leveraging the decoupling effect of SFs in text generation."

A key novelty in our approach is the formulation for Successor Features (SF) training, which necessitates accuracy from the reward model **exclusively** at the discourse's end. This design allows the linear regression to capture the actual reward with significant accuracy at the endpoint while disregarding less accurate parts of the sentence. This focused approach in SF training is a substantial departure from existing methods, underscoring our method's novelty. It addresses a challenge in text generation where the reward is only accessible after the complete sentence has been generated.\n2. Furthermore, we believe that the application of SFs for the text generation domain represents a significant step in this field. The rationale behind our method is to disentangle the language model's dynamics from task-specific rewards. This disentanglement hasn\u2019t been explored before and is crucial for efficiently computing value functions across diverse tasks. For instance, as personalized and customized language models gain more attention, our method presents a notable breakthrough in achieving controlled text generation more efficiently.\n\n__\"The scope of the experimental evaluation appears limited\"__\n1. We selected the two datasets for evaluation because they are not only representative but also widely utilized in previous research. This decision was made to ensure that our work aligns with established benchmarks in the field, allowing for a direct and meaningful comparison of our results with existing studies.\n2. We would like to clarify a misunderstanding regarding the use of different Large Language Models (LLMs) for each task. In our experiments, we consistently employed GPT-2 Large as the base language model across all baselines and our proposed method. This approach was meticulously chosen to ensure the comparability of results across different tasks and methods.\n3. In Section 5.2, we have included a detailed analysis demonstrating the time efficiency of our approach.\n\n## Questions\n1. __\"Could further clarification or empirical evidence be provided regarding the influence of the \"linearity constraint\"...\"__\nFirst, we should remark that using our novel reformulation of SF, the reward is only needed at the terminal states and the possible inaccuracy due to linear regression has significantly less impact (as compared to the standard SF formulation). Further, it can be shown theoretically that the nonlinearity of reward can be pushed in the features provided that the features are rich enough, which is largely the case in our problem, as the features are also generated by a LM. This is accentuated since the base reward in our problems of interest is often quite polar (with a high probability the reward is either very close to one or very close to zero). Hence, the weights in the linear product of $r = \\phi^T \\cdot w$ can take the form of identifiers, when the feature vector is rich enough (more formally, only some elements of $w$ need to be non-zero to light up the features corresponding to the admission of the subject of interest when there is a non-zero reward, and all components of $w$ can be zero when there is no terminal reward). Therefore, while generally the linearity constraint is expected to degrade the quality of value functions, as it is also evident from Table 1 & 2, rectification with SF is on par with the RECT method, which does not use a linear reward. \nWe will add a similar discussion to the paper to clarify and to motivate that SF is highly expected to produce results at the level of RECT, while allowing for multi-subject control.\n\n2. __\"Similarly, could additional insights be shared about the \"safety conditions\" that were factored into the comparative results with DEXPERTS?\"__\nIn our paper, when we stated that combining reward parameters does not \"affect the other,\" a more precise expression would be that the impact is \"less affected\" rather than unaffected. This distinction is crucial and we appreciate your pointing out the need for clarity.\nTo elaborate, in Table 4, we presented results where multiple attributes such as \"attack\" and \"threat\" are combined and targeted simultaneously. In these cases, we observed a significant reduction in the toxic generations corresponding to these targeted attributes. This indicates that the combination of multiple subjects is effective in specifically reducing toxicity in the targeted categories.\nIn the meanwhile, note that attributes not explicitly targeted by the combined parameters, such as \"sexually explicit\" content, show a different trend. While there is an impact, it is comparatively less affected. This observation is in line with our initial hypothesis that combining reward parameters would primarily influence the targeted attributes, while having a lesser impact on others."
