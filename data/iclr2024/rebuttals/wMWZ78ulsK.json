Perhaps I am biased, since I had not\npreviously been aware of the IGL framework, but I had trouble\nunderstanding both the motivation behind the problem framework and the\nalgorithm. Given that IGL is a relatively new and unexplored topic, I\nbelieve the paper can be improved by giving less abstract examples of\nthe IGL framework early on (for instance, everything became quite a\nbit more clear to me once I saw the benchmark in the experimental\nsection).\n\nMoreover, I did not find the argument for the necessity to include the\nregularization term particularly convincing. I would have liked to\nhave seen stronger evidence (particularly before the regulization term\nwas introduced) to suggest that the mode of overfitting discussed in\nthe paper actually occurs. Notably, without the regularization term,\nthe algorithm/optimization problem is considerably simpler.\nHaving said that, since the algorithm still\nappears to be novel even without the regularization term, I think this\nis mostly an issue of organizing the content to improve clarity."

This looks like $x, a$ are sampled\nindependently, but really $a$ sampled conditionally on $x$. I believe\nit should be more like $x\\sim d_0,a\\sim\\pi(\\cdot\\mid x)$.\n\nAdmittedly I am not intimately familiar with MI optimization, but it\nis not obvious to me why we should expect minimization of the standard\nMI objective to \"overfit\" to maximize $I(Y; R_\\psi)$ as you claim. I\nsee that the objective can be decreased by increasing this term, but I\nsee now reason why thi wouldn't be balanced by a decrease of the $I(Y;\nX, A, R_\\psi)$\nterm. Has this been demonstrated experimentally? If so, can you\nprovide citations? If this paper is the first demonstration of this\noverfitting phenomenon, it might be nice to show those results\nbefore defining the regularized objective, it would help motivate your approach.\n\nWhy is it that the experiments with $\\beta=0$ exhibited the most\nvariance? In this case, I would expect variance to be lower, since\nyou're optimizing over fewer neural network parameters / the\noptimization has one less level of nesting.\n\nIn Algorithm 1, what does \"Ensure: Policy $\\pi$\" mean?"

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer yTyJ for his/her time and feedback on our work. The following is our response to the reviewer's comments and questions.\n\n**1. Regularizer in Objective (4) and \"over-fitting\" problem.**\n\nThe reviewer asks for stronger evidence for including the regularizer $I(X,A;R_\\psi)$ in Objective (4) and explanations for the \"over-fitting\" problem. As this has been empirically shown in our numerical results in Table 4, we would like to discuss it in greater details. Indeed, we can show that when minimizing only $I(Y;X,A|R_\\psi)$: **(A1)** *any* feedback-dependent reward decoder $\\psi:\\mathcal{Y}\\to[0,1]$ attains a small value, and **(A2)** the minimum is attained by a subset of feedback-dependent reward decoders $\\psi:\\mathcal{Y}\\to\\{0,1\\}$ that assigns value 1 to \"an arbitrary half of\" the feedback in the data distribution, if the feedback variable $Y$ is (nearly) deterministic to the context-action $(X,A)$. Both cases would lead to the \"over-fitting\" problem. We totally agree with the reviewer that presenting these results before defining the regularized objective helps motivate our approach. We have included this discussion in the revised Section 4.1.\n\n**Detailed analysis.** To showcase these arguments, first note that minimizing $I(Y;X,A|R_\\psi)$ is equivalent to\n$$\\min_\\psi\\mathcal{L}'(\\psi):=(H(R_\\psi|X,A)-H(R_\\psi|X,A,Y))-(H(R_\\psi)-H(R_\\psi|Y))$$\nwhere $H$ is the Shannon entropy. This holds by the facts that $I(Y;X,A|R_\\psi)=I(Y;R_\\psi|X,A)-I(Y;R_\\psi)+I(Y;X,A)$ and the last term $I(Y;X,A)$ is independent of the reward decoder. Hence, the value is non-positive for any reward decoder $\\psi:\\mathcal{Y}\\to[0,1]$ by noting that $H(R_\\psi|X,A,Y)=H(R_\\psi|Y)$ and $H(R_\\psi|X,A)\\le H(R_\\psi)$. In contrast, $\\mathcal{L}'$ can be positive for reward decoders that also depend on the context(-action), which justifies **(A1)**. Further, if the feedback $Y$ is (nearly) deterministic to the context-action $(X,A)$, we have that $H(R_\\psi|X,A)\\approx H(R_\\psi|Y(X,A))\\approx0$, and hence the minimum $-\\log2$ is attained by any reward decoder $\\psi:\\mathcal{Y}\\to\\{0,1\\}$ that assigns value 1 to \"an arbitrary half of\" the feedback in the data distribution (i.e., $\\mathbb{E}\\_{x\\sim d_0,a\\sim\\pi_\\textup{b}(\\cdot|x)}[\\psi(Y(x,a))]=0.5$), which justifies **(A2)**.\n\n**2. Large variance for experiments with $\\beta=0$.**\n\nWe believe that the observation that the experiments with $\\beta=0$ displayed the highest variance is closely related to the minimization of $I(Y;X,A|R_\\psi)$, which we have discussed in response to the reviewer's Comment 1 above. Since any feedback-dependent reward decoder can attain a small value of $I(Y;X,A|R_\\psi)$, the training process will be highly unstable and the optimized reward decoder will be constantly changing at every iteration that could lead to high variance.\n\n**3. \"Does the context distribution have to be fixed throughout training?\"** \n\nYes, while the results are reported for fixed context distribution throughout training, the algorithm can be also applied to non-stationary context distribution. \n\n**4. Notation of $V(\\pi)$.**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the possible ambiguity in the notation. We have revised it to $V(\\pi):=\\mathbb{E}\\_{x\\sim d_0}\\mathbb{E}_{a\\sim\\pi(\\cdot|x)}[\\mu(x,a)]$ in the paper.\n\n**5. \"Ensure: Policy $\\pi$\" in Algorithm 1.**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the typo in Algorithm 1. We have corrected this typo in the revision."

On the other hand, our work focuses on the specific RL problem in the IGL setting. Please note that our main contribution is to propose an information theoretic approach to this RL problem, while the reviewer seems to evaluate the novelty of our estimation method for conditional mutual information. We sincerely hope that the reviewer would also consider our contributions on addressing the IGL-based RL setting in his/her evaluation of our work. \n\n**3. Appendix**\n\nWe wish the reviewer could be more specific on what is missing in the main text. Since all our theoretical derivations and numerical results have been already included in the main text, we did not include an Appendix in the submission. According to the conference rules, submitting an Appendix is not mandatory for the submissions. We will be happy to answer any follow-up questions the reviewer might have on what he/she thinks is missing in the paper. Also, we have provided our code in the revision as a supplementary file, which can be used to verify the numerical results if necessary."

                    "value": "The paper discusses the challenges and solutions in the context of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms when the agent lacks complete knowledge of the reward variable. When there is no explicit reward, the agent must infer the reward from observed feedback, increasing the computational and statistical complexity of the RL problem.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL) framework is introduced. In IGL, the agent observes a context, takes an action, and receives feedback, aiming to maximize the unobserved return by inferring rewards from this interaction. The key to this approach is a properly inferred reward decoder, which maps the context-action-feedback tuple to a prediction of the latent reward. However, learning such a reward decoder can be information-theoretically infeasible without additional assumptions on the relationship between context, action, feedback, and reward variables.\n\nOne such assumption, known as Full Conditional Independence, posits that feedback is conditionally independent of context and action given the latent reward. Existing IGL methods use this assumption and propose joint training of the policy and decoder. However, noisy feedback in real-world scenarios may challenge the validity of this assumption.\n\nThe paper introduces Variational Information-based IGL (VI-IGL) as an information-theoretic approach to IGL-based RL tasks. VI-IGL aims to ensure conditional independence between feedback and context action by minimizing an information-based objective function. It includes a regularization term to make the reward decoder robust to feedback noise.\n\nThe challenge of optimizing this objective is addressed by leveraging the variational representation of mutual information (MI) and formulating the problem as a min-max optimization. This allows gradient-based algorithms to efficiently solve it. The paper also extends the approach to f-Variational Information-based IGL (f-VI-IGL), creating a family of algorithms for the IGL-based RL problem.\n\nEmpirical results suggest that VI-IGL outperforms existing IGL RL algorithms, particularly in noisy feedback scenarios. The key contributions of the paper include the introduction of an information-theoretic approach to IGL-based RL, a novel optimization technique for handling continuous random variables, and the extension of the approach to f-VI-IGL."

Here is our response to the reviewers' comments and questions:\n\n**1. \"How much the KL approximation optimum can be far from the original optimal solution?\"** \n\nWe follow a standard approach to apply variational analysis to estimating the  mutual information. In Proposition 2, if the function class $\\mathcal{T}$ includes all functions, then the KL approximation is tight. As our proposed algorithm leverages neural networks and gradient-based method, we adopt the  parameterized function class. We note that lower bounding the mutual information by the variational optimization is standard [1, 2].

Finite-Sample Guarantees.**\n\nPlease refer to our general response.\n\n**3. Numerical results in the noiseless setting.** \n\nWe note that the algorithm proposed by Xie et al. (2021) is designed for the noiseless IGL setting, while our proposed algorithm $f$-VI-IGL is designed to address the RL task under a noisy feedback, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. As we observed in our numerical results, while Xie et al.'s algorithm attains better numerical results in the noiseless setting, its performance can degrade significantly under a noisy observation of the feedback variable. In contrast, our proposed method managed to achieve better results in the noisy case.\n\n**4. Computational costs of the proposed RL method.**\n\nWhile our proposed $f$-VI-IGL algorithm requires training of deep neural nets to estimate the mutual information terms in the objective, we observed that the training often enjoys a fast convergence. In our experiments, the training times of $f$-VI-IGL were in worst case $2\\times$ more than the training time of Xie et al.'s algorithm, while achieving satisfactory numerical results in the noisy IGL environment."
