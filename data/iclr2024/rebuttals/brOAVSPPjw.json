                    "value": "The work presents the learning dynamics of both single value network and target network settings for residual reinforcement learning. It employs the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework to derive the learning dynamics. The authors pose this as a theoretical model to understand an ensemble of NNs trained empirically. They use the linearization (in parameters) technique for writing the dynamics of how the parameters change thereby turning the problem into a linear ODE. They also provide experimental results for a toy domain and the cartpole domain to compare the parameter dynamics and the empirically trained NN."

                    "value": "While I found the paper to be an interesting read I observe some crucial issues with the work which need addressing.\n\n**Lack of related work:** While the authors have cited relevant work in DL theory, they are missing come crucial citations [1, 2, 3, 4]. The issue is that previous works have explored similar problems. For example, the setting where gradient \"flows\" through both $Q_{\\theta}(s, a)$ and $Q_{\\theta}(s', a')$ is called residual learning [3, 4]. The equation number 7 by the authors has a single sample analog in [3] (see Equation (1) in the paper). Baird [4] introduced the idea of residual algorithms to make the TD algorithm more principled. Further see related work [5]. Please let me know if I am mistaken about this connection. [1] has a different type of linearization: where they linearize the learnt function in the first layer weights for single hidden layer networks, while this is not directly applicable it has a connection with the current work. Similarly, [3] gives insights into when and if TD with NNs and homogenous activations converges albeit in discrete setting, depending on the environment.\n\n**Not a substantial enough conclusion:**  I appreciate that the authors have derived and written down the dynamics of learning in the NTK regime. While it is a useful contribution, I am afraid that I am not able to discern a valid and strong conclusion. \n\nI see that the authors have introduced the TD version of $\\Theta_0$ (just like Lee et al. 2019) but I would be interested in how this matrix effects the convergence. I believe this is where the environment dynamics come into play. Further, I would expect a theorem similar to Theorem 2.1 by Lee et al. 2019 (latest arxiv version). Theorem 2.1 by Lee et al. 2019 provides a sense of how far the linear approximation $f^{lin}$ is from the true function $f$ i.e. order of $1/n^{-1/2}$. I would expect something similar with relation to the environment dynamics (and not only the width of the NN) for the work to be more applicable to TD learning.\n\nSimilarly, Brandfonbrener and Bruna, 2020 [2] provide some insights into when and if neural TD learning converges depending on the geometry of the space of function approximators, the structure of the underlying Markov chain, and their interaction. This brings in aspects of reinforcement learning and transition dynamics. This issue also relates to the previously stated issue of a lack of related work.\n\nFurther, the experiments seem a bit inconclusive to me, especially the experiment on cartpole domain. While I appreciate the new comparisons in Figures  3 and 4, even in a toy environment we see the parameters behaving differently (in Figure 1). The authors also remark that their analytic model does not match the empirical model in Section 5.1 but no reasoning is provided. For cartpole the result is surprising the linearized dynamics work better and is definitely a meaningful contribution. I would be curious to see results normalized by the true values? As far as I can tell, both NNs and TD-NTK do not \"fit very well\" with different degrees of \"not fitting very well\".\n\n**Statement of assumptions:** I would be curious to know when TD-NTK does not converge? I would be surprised if it converges everywhere without assumptions (as I presume is noted in Equation 31 in the appendix). For example, [5] and [4] both say that residual RL might not always converge. Similarly, Lee et al 2019 assumed $\\lambda_{min}(\\Theta_0) > 0$. Further discussions regarding assumptions can be found in [1] and [2]. These assumptions are better stated clearly.\n\nI do not intend to discourage the line of work the authors are pursuing. It is very important for the research community that we have a concrete theory of Deep RL that relates to practice. The training dynamics derivation is very useful and much appreciated but the work would fair better with a stronger conclusion and connections to previous work.\n\n****\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Neural Temporal-Difference and Q-Learning Provably Converge to Global Optima, Qi Cai, Zhuoran Yang, Jason D.

                    "value": "**Questions:**\nWhile most questions are above I present a few more here:\n1. What is the state space in the cartpole environment? \n2. How was the behavior policy learnt in cartpole environment?\n3. What is the idea behind deriving the expression for $Q^{lin}(\\mathcal X^*)$? Is this related to generalization (I guess similar to Lee et al. 2019)? \n4. If you consider the central graph in Figure 1, it shows that the difference in parameter dynamics is substantial.\n5. I would expect that the comparison should be if the $Q$ functions predict the right action (as opposed to the accuracy), across empirical and analytic models, as it is well known that a \"wrong\" NN Q function can lead to a good policy as seen in Figure 3 of the DDPG paper (arxiv version). This would be interesting in addition to Figure 2. Same applies for table 1.\n\n\n**Minor issues:**\n\n1. Section 2.1 we will complement -> we complement\n2.

We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s recognition of the value in finding solutions to the temporal difference dynamics and interest in its related empirical investigation. We thank the reviewer for providing relevant references to support this work and would like to address some of the points raised.\n\nWe have not included a thorough derivation of the approximation $f^\\text{lin}$ distance to $f$ similar to theorem 2.1 by Lee et al. (2019); as we describe in the text (section 4.1, after eq. 6) why the reasoning is analogous if the equivalent assumptions from Lee et al. are made in the temporal difference setup, and the same results, such as errors of the order $1/n^{-1/2}$ with hidden layer with $n$, still holds.\n\nWe do agree with the reviewer that the environment dynamics manifest themselves in $\\Theta_0$ which, as we point out in eq. 11, would affect what the critical learning rate for convergence is. As far as training dynamics are involved, we don\u2019t think the environment dynamics (at least in the deterministic dynamics case) introduce additional caveats towards the conditions necessary for our approximations to hold.\n\nAnswers to Questions:\nThe cartpole environment has a 4-dimensional state space (position of the cart, velocity of the cart, angle of the pole, angular velocity of the pole). We use 2048 transitions $(s, a, r, s\u2019)$ to train the networks.\nThe behavior policy was a $\\max_{a\u2019} Q(s\u2019, a\u2019)$ from a Q-function learned by a single hidden-layer DQN agent trained online.\nFinding an expression at arbitrary state-actions $\\mathcal{X}^*$ is indeed to investigate the generalization of the predictions of the model/ensemble. The high-level idea to derive this is that by the linearisation of $Q(\\mathcal{X^*}) = Q_0(\\mathcal{X}^*) + \\nabla_\\theta Q_0(\\mathcal{X}^*)\\omega_t$, one can substitute the expression for $\\omega_t$ to obtain the expression for Q-values at arbitrary state-actions $\\mathcal{X}^*$ throughout and at the end of training.\nThat is true, some degree of discrepancy is expected to accumulate throughout training.\nThe environment represented in figure 2 is the toy environment, having only one action, although we can include this for the cartpole environment\nMinor issues: we have incorporated the suggested changes into the paper."

The study requires a significant extension to be further considered for publication. \n\n1. The theoretical contribution of the paper is merely the calculation of NTK dynamics for Q-learning by supervised learning over fixed datasets of rollouts adapted from existing work [ Lee et al. (2019) ]. This part does not bring any new contributions or insights.\n\n2. The title, abstract, and introduction of the paper need to be more accurate. \nSetting studied in the paper are not those of online or offline reinforcement learning. The studied setup can be characterized as a Q-learning approach via supervised learning over a fixed dataset. Namely, a dataset of dumped policy-environment interactions is used to train the parameters of a Q-network. It differs from the standard online and offline actor-critic RL setups in which the actor (policy) and critic (Q-network) is approximated simultaneously.\nNamely, the work ignores the issue of approximating the policy action on the next-state; this kind of analysis detached from policy properties is a pure Q-learning.\nAs stated, the Bellman bootstrap equation reads $Q^{\\pi}(s, a) = r + \\gamma \\sum_{s'} P(s'|s,a) \\pi(a'|s') Q^{\\pi}(s', a')$, but it does not lead to the supervised learning loss function (6). $\\mathcal{X}'$ is unavailable in the RL setup. The dataset MDP tuples  $ (s_i, a_i, r_i, s_i')$ does not contain the next actions; they should be obtained from the policy instead, as the Q is an estimated value of the trajectories obtained _by following the policy $\\pi$_. It is a separate issue of how to regularize and avoid issues with distribution shift at this stage addressed by modern Offline RL methods, including TD3-BC [1] and FDCR [2].\n\n[1] Kostrikov I., \"Offline Reinforcement Learning with Fisher Divergence Critic Regularization\", ICML 2021\n[2] S. Fujimoto and S. Gu, \"A Minimalist Approach to Offline Reinforcement Learning\", NeurIPS 2021\n\n3. Experimental evaluation could be stronger. Only simple environments (a toy one and a cartpole are used) are particular, and it is unclear how the obtained conclusions will transfer to more complex environments widely used as benchmarks (MuJoCo).\n\nMinor remarks:\n* p.5 below (11) \"maximum and minimum values of \u0398.\" -> eigenvalues,\n* p.5 below (11) \"This is expected because in this regime learning the value function is essentially a\nsupervised learning task of learning the immediate rewards, and all terms with policy dependence\n(those involving X \u2032 ) drop out as would be expected in a supervised learning task.\" in supervised learning task that is true, but unfortunately not in an RL task :)\n* p. 6 (5.1) \"the value will be $1$ (taking $\\gamma = 1$) for all $s < 1$ and $0$ otherwise.\" I think the condition is switched here (value $0$ for $s<1$).\n* p. 8 (5.2) \"the true returns obtained by rolling out the evaluated policy in the environment to evaluate our method.\" the issue of policy-generating data requires more attention in the experimental section.\n* derivations in C.1 and C.2 are not needed, these are solutions of simple non-homogenous differential equations,"

We are grateful for the recognition of the ambitious nature of the problem, and that the findings were perceived as promising. We would like to address some of the concerns pointed out in the review. \n\n**Weakness 1:**\n\nWe want to first maintain that our work is distinct from supervised learning. We believe it is inaccurate to frame our approach as \u201csupervised Q-learning\u201d and disagree with the reviewer in our theoretical analysis not providing novel contributions. Supervised learning assumes ground-truth labels available for the quantity that is being learned, and we stress is not the case in our setup: we do not assume no return samples or extended traces are available (only states, actions, next-states and immediate rewards for single transitions are observed). The novelty in our contribution is exactly to describe how to adapt the methods that analyze training dynamics from the neural tangent kernel perspective in supervised learning to the temporal difference policy evaluation setting with only $(s,a,r,s\u2019)$ tuples available. Crucially, the policy being evaluated does not need to coincide with the policy that generated the data.\n\n**Weakness 2:**\n\nAgain, we disagree that the setting considered is supervised learning as no ground-truth return labels are available for training. We agree with the reviewer that we are not directly modeling the full \u201creinforcement learning\u201d task, and this is highlighted in the abstract where we specifically describe our contributions as being relevant to \u201ctemporal difference policy evaluation methods\u201d and associated uncertainty quantification. Nonetheless, forms of temporal difference off-policy evaluation are key elements present in many RL algorithms, and we believe better understanding temporal difference policy evaluation with neural networks is an important milestone towards better understanding deep RL (particularly in the offline setting with a static dataset).\n\nWe would also like to point out that, as specified in section 3, the actions in the state-action pairs $\\mathcal{X\u2019}$ are those computed from the policy *that we wish to evaluate* at the next-states, which is assumed given in the policy evaluation setting and would correspond to the action taken by the actor in the RL setting (in the RL setting, this quantity is also derived from the actor). In fact, we entirely agree with the reviewer\u2019s comment that \u201cQ is an estimated value of the trajectories obtained *by following the policy* $\\pi$\u201d. As the action in $\\mathcal{X\u2019}$ is taken from the policy we are evaluating, and is not related to the next actions taken in the trace that generates the data, these are exactly the Q-values learned by training with the loss in eq. 6.\n\n**Weakness 3:**\n\nWhile we appreciate that this is not confirmed with empirical experiments in the current version of our work, our focus was on exposing the theory, and much like previous work investigating neural tangent kernel training dynamics we do not expect size of state or action space size to have a significant effect on the quality of the training dynamics approximations\n\n**Minor remarks:**\n\nWe would like to note, that for the setting where $\\gamma = 0$ (minor remark #2), the equation simplifies to the supervised learning case. The other case, when $\\gamma \\neq 0$ it is no longer a supervised learning task, and we wanted to highlight this difference in the text. For minor remark #3 we maintain that the true value function will be 1 when $s$ is less than 1 ($V(s) = 1$ when $s < 1$). The agent always moves right, and crossing the line at $s=1$ grants a reward of 1, so everything on the left of the line ($s<1$) has value 1 (when $\\gamma=1$) and everything to the right ($s>1$) leads to terminal states with no further rewards, and the value here must be 0."

It's not clear if there are any insights that can be gained from the solutions to the differential equations.\n * The empirical results are only for the simplest of RL environments (1 and 4 dimensional state spaces; 0 and 1 dimensional action spaces). Since deep RL is primarily useful for high-dimensional environments with complex value functions, it would be more convincing if the authors evaluated on these types of environments as well.\n * The analysis is restricted to finding the Q-function of a fixed policy, while reinforcement learning algorithms generally use a TD loss like $\\left(Q(s, a) - (R(s, a) + \\\\max_{a'} Q(s', a'))\\right)^2$.\n\nAlso, there has been some previous analysis of RL with NTK approximation by Yang et al. [1], who go beyond training dynamics for a fixed-policy and give regret bounds for an optimistic variant of Q-learning with the NTK. It would be good to include a comparison to their work.\n\n[1] Yang et al. On Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning: Optimism in the Face of Large State Spaces. NeurIPS 2020."

Also, the derived kernel $\\Theta$ captures the training dynamics of these settings, and can be studied in the future for insight into stability and generalization. We think that analyzing the behavior of infinitely-wide NNs offers a foundation for developing a systematic comprehension of finite-width NNs.\n\n**Question 2 (Are the analytical solutions presented in this paper also good approximations for TD learning in higher-dimensional state/action spaces?):**\n\nThe derived solutions in theory are general, and also apply to higher-dimensional state/action spaces. While we appreciate that this is not confirmed with empirical experiments in the current version of our work, our focus was on exposing the theory, and much like previous work investigating neural tangent kernel training dynamics we do not expect size of state or action space size to have a significant effect on the quality of the training dynamics approximations\n\n**Question 3 (Can the analysis be extended to using a fitted Q-iteration loss where $Q(s\u2019, a\u2019)$ is replaced with $\\max_{a\u2019} Q(s\u2019, a\u2019)$?):**\n\nWe appreciate that this is a very relevant extension to our work which we are actively investigating, and that it may introduce additional insight into the instabilities present in offline RL related overestimation of Q-values."

This severely limits the potential impact of the work since full-gradient algorithms are not used in practice and, more importantly, it's not entirely clear if the solutions to the objectives in full-gradient algos are actually desirable (see eg. chapters 11.4 - 11.5 in Sutton). I believe this aspect should be better highlighted and contextualized in the paper.\n\nAuthors also show that their NTK derivation of TD-learning with semi-gradient descent and target network (the more relevant setup) does not follow the same dynamics as under SGD which is an interesting finding even if negative. However the relevant figures are pushed to the appendix and there is not discussion as to why might this be the case. Is it because NTK simply is not a good approximation for algorithms which do not follow a proper gradient field? Is it because of the added complexity of the slowly moving target network?\n\nThe last question also points to some lack of clarity in the paper as it bundles together target networks with semi-gradient methods. However having a different target function is a separate design decision from choosing not to use the gradient of the target network. This also leads to a possible experiment: is the linearisation better at approximating training dynamics in the semi-gradient setup without a separate target network?\n\nFinally, it would be interesting to mention and develop how your empirical findings impact some of the previous works that use the linearisation of neural (gradient/semi-gradient) TD-learning to come-up with convergence proofs.

We would like to address here some of the points raised in the review.\n\nWe would like to note that the toy environment has a continuous state space, and we chose to train the agent from 21 starting positions (instead of a 21-states MDP).\n\n**Concern 1 (are the solutions to the objectives in full-gradient algos actually desirable?):**\n\nWhile we agree that full-gradient algorithms are not yet often used in practice, it is a common simplifying assumption in analyzing training dynamics (for example in the neural tangent kernel literature) to retain a degree of theoretical tractability while still maintaining the core ingredients of the optimization process involved. While we appreciate the example highlighted by the reviewer as to why the stated gradient objective may not always be desirable, these are valid for some stochastic MDPs, and in many other cases, including all environments with deterministic transitions, the training will converge to a consistent value function. We have amended the manuscript to discuss these two points, and therefore explain why our approach is still sound for many environments of interest.\n\n**Concern 2 (no discussion on why TD semi-gradient with target network does not follow the same dynamics as SGD):**\n\nIn section 4.1, we justify why the linearisation holds for the single network case. The same reasoning does not directly hold for the target network analysis in section 4.2, and as such there is no direct theoretical guarantee that the linearisation will also hold here. We included the analogous analysis and empirical results anyway due to the relevance of the setup to practical algorithms, which we are glad the reviewer agrees are interesting negative results. We have amended the manuscript to clarify and put in better context how the analysis for the target network case is not guaranteed to approximate the true learning dynamics in the same way the single network case does.\n\n**Concern 3 (target networks and semi-gradient methods bundled together):**\n\nWe considered including an analysis for the setting suggested by the reviewer that employs semi-gradient methods without a target network. However, we decided not to because being a semi-gradient it does not satisfy the conditions for neural tangent kernel linearistation to hold (unlike the case analyzed in section 4.1) and is also not common in practice."
