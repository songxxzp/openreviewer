You have raised the following main point. \n- I apologize for my limited familiarity with the solvability of the NIEP and NMF problems. I have a straightforward question: Based on my understanding of Schur decomposition, it seems that a nonnegative matrix  with a given spectrum can be expressed as \n$A = U (\\\\Lambda + V) U'$,  where $U$ \n is orthogonal, and $V$ \n is upper triangular. If this is the case, does the solvability of the nonlinear system \n $U (\\\\Lambda + V) U' \\\\geq 0$ \n offer a potential approach to address the NIEP problem from an optimization perspective?\n\nHere is our response.  Yes, you are right, but this is a non-convex problem: the set of \n$K \\times K$ orthogonal matrices (which is called the Stiefel manifold in the literature) \nis non-convex, and the optimization problem is also non-convex, so computationally, \nthis is a challenging problem. For example, we may put an $\\\\epsilon$-net on the Stiefel manifold (so that for any point on the Stiefel manifold, there is a point in the net within a distance of $\\\\epsilon$) and only \ncheck your inequality when $U$ is a net-point.   However, such an $\\\\epsilon$-net will have at least \n$C(1/\\\\epsilon)^{O(K^2)}$ points, so this approach is computationally infeasible for relatively large $K$."

You have raised two major points. \n- What is the connection between the NMF problem and the NIEP problem?\n- What is the result that this paper shows and what are already known results?\n\nResponse to your main point 1.  Thanks for your valuable comments. \nTo clarify,   the whole section of Section  1.1 is for explaining the relationship between NMF and NIEP. In detail,  if  the NIEP is solvable for $(K, m)$, then \nthe NMF is solvable if Condition (A) is satisfied with $a \\geq a_{K, m}$, and \nCondition (A) cannot be further relaxed in the sense that $a_{K, m}$ is the smallest possible value of $a$ there. When the NIEP is not solvable, then the NMF is solvable if Condition (A) is satisfied with an $a \\geq \\tilde{a}\\_{K, m}$  where\n$\\tilde{a}\\_{K, m}  > a_{K,m}$ is given explicitly in Section 4. In this case,  we are not sure if $\\tilde{a}_{K, m}$  is the smallest possible $a$ there.  Additionally, we have also added Section L in the supplement to explain the relationship between the NMF problem and network modeling.  \n\n\nResponse to your main point 2. Thanks for your valuable comment.  We have revised several places in Section 1 to improve literature review, overview of our results, and comparison with existing literature.  To further clarify, \nour main results are as follows. \n- The orthodox NIEP concerns the following problem:  given $K$ numbers $\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\ldots, \\sigma_K$, when do we have a $K \\times K$ non-negative matrix $M$ with $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_K$ as its eigenvalues?   \nThe existing literature on the NIEP have been largely focused on general $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\ldots, \\sigma_K)$ but \nsmall $K$ (e.g., $K \\leq 4$) (e.g., see the two survey papers we added  in the first paragraph of \nthe introduction). Especially, the orthodox NIEP and all of the subproblems we mentioned in the first \nparagraph of our paper remain unsolved for $K \\geq 5$.  See Page 1 of the paper for details.  \n- Since the orthodox NIEP is too hard (and people can only crack the case for $K \\leq 4$ in the past  70 years),  it is of interest to focus on some special cases (especially those motivated by real applications),  where the results may be more fruitful.  \n- Motivated by the NMF problem and network modeling, we  focus on a special case where \n$(\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2, \\ldots, \\sigma_K) = (1 + a_{K, m}, 1, \\ldots, 1, -1, \\ldots, -1)$  but $K$ is arbitrary. Here,  $1 \\leq m \\leq (K-1)$, and $a_{K,m} = \\max\\{0, 2m-K\\}$. \nWe show that for $9$ different cases (S1)-(S9), the NIEP is solvable.  For example, one of these cases is $K$ is a multiple of $4$ and $m$ is arbitrary; we show that in this case the NIEP is always solvable.   We also identify two cases (N1)-(N2)  and proved that the NIEP is not solvable in these cases. Table 1 in Section 3 summarizes our results for all pairs of $(K, m)$ with $K \\leq 20$ (but \nour theorems are for general $(K, m)$).  \n- Moreover, using the results on NIEP and the connection  between NMF and NIEP in Section 1.1,  we derive sharp results for NMF in Section 4. There is a rich literature on solving general NMF problems of the form $V \\approx W H$, e.g. [1] and the ensuing work, but they cannot be directly applied to our NMF problem (2), which has a more constrained factorization. We will add these discussion to the paper.\n\nIn response, we will make the following changes. \n- We have revised the first paragraph of Section 1 to clarify the difference between orthodox NIEP and our NIEP. Especially,  we have added more references to the literature on the NIEP.   \nOn Page 1, we have revised the first paragraph and added several \nreferences. Existing approaches on NIEP include the Fiedler's approach and Soules' approach, \nbut these approaches focus on the orthodox NIEP and are very different from ours.  \nWe focus on a special NIEP, where the results are new (especially as the NIEP \nremain unsolved for $K \\geq 5$ while our $K$ is arbitrary).  See the two NIEP survey papers we added on Page 1 for details.  \n- We have  revised Section 1.1 slightly to clarify the relationship between NMF and NIEP.  \n- We will revise our results summary in Section 1.2 \n- We have added Section L in the supplement to explain the relationship between the NMF problem and network modeling.  We have also discussed the modeling of $5$ real networks. \n\n[1] Daniel D Lee and H Sebastian Seung.

Since it is difficult, this paper considers one of its special cases: for the integer pair $(K, m)$, under what conditions, there exists a $K \\times K$ orthogonal matrix $Q$ that can be efficiently computed, such that $Q J_{K, m} Q^\\top$ is doubly stochastic, where $J_{K, m} = \\text{diag}(1+a_{K,m}, 1, \\cdots, 1, -1, \\cdots, -1)$ and $a_{K, m} =\\max \\\\{ 0, 2m - K \\\\}$.

                        "value": "**Response to your main points**.  Many thanks for your very positive feedback on our paper. We are especially glad that you think our approaches are novel, our proofs are solid, and our paper is well written. You have raised the following main points. \n-  This paper is very technical and it would be better if it could introduce more related work in the introduction section about NIEP and NMF, etc.\n-  This paper analyzes the solvability of the special NIEP and provides the algorithms for NMF, but does not give the time complexity of the proposed method, which lacks comparisons with some prior methods with respect to time efficiency.\n-  Although this paper presents the application of the proposed problem in NMF and network modeling in Section 4, it is still not very clear the specific applications in NMF and DCMM. It would be better if some specific experiments were implemented for NMF and network analysis.\n\nResponse to your main point 1.  Thanks for your comments. In response, first, in the last few lines of the first paragraph of the introduction, we have add a couple of sentences and four references to orthodox NIEP,  including two survey papers on NIEP. \nSecond, we have added a long discussion on how the NMF problem in equation (2) \nis motivated by social network modeling. Due to space limit, we have put it in the Section L of the \nsupplement. \n\nResponse to your main point 2. Time efficiency of the proposed algorithm: with explicit construction of the $Q$ matrix, the dominating computation in both Algorithms 1 and 2 are computing the top $K$ Eigen value and vector pairs of a $n$-by-$n$ real symmetric matrix, which can be solved in O($Kn^2$) time by the Lanczos method or power iteration, and there exist quite a few numerically stable and well optimized software implementations. Standard methods for NMF such as the multiplicative update method of [1] are iterative optimization, and usually run in $O(T K n^2)$ time, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Hence our proposed method with explicit construction of the $Q$ matrix has similar time complexity to existing methods. However, [1] and other optimization-based NMF methods yield factorizations of the form $V \\approx W H$, where $W$ and $H$ are allowed to be different. To solve our NMF problem in (2), these techniques need to be modified to enforce extra constraints and may run slower. When constructing $Q$ via numerical optimization as in Lemma 13, the time complexity can be significantly higher. We will add these discussions to the paper.\n\nResponse to your main point 3.  Thanks and this is a very interesting point. In Section L of the supplement, we have added a section explaining how the NMF problem is related \nto network modeling. Consider a network with $K$ communities. \nThe rank-$K$ model is one of the most frequently used model \nfor social works, including block models, random dot product graph (RDGP) models, \nand generalized RDGP models as special cases. The Degree-Corrected Mixed-Membership \nmodel is also a rank-$K$ model, but where the parameters all have explicit meanings and are \nmore interpretable in practice. An interesting question is therefore when a rank-$K$ model is also a DCMM model. \nWe show that \n- When $K = 2$, a rank-$K$ model is always a DCMM model. \nFor the frequently seen networks weblog, dolphin, karate, polbooks for example. \nIn the literature, we usually assume they have $2$ communities, and \nso a rank-$2$ model are appropriate. Using our results, whenever a rank-$2$ model \nis appropriate for these networks, a DCMM model is also appropriate for them. \n- For networks with $K \\geq 3$ communities,  we may similarly model them with a rank-$K$ model. And to check if we can write them as a DCMM model, all we need is to check whether \nCondition (B*) in Section 4 is satisfied; we can check this by estimating $\\Omega$ first. See Section 4 of  (Jin, 2022) for example, where it was argued that UKFaculty network satisfies Condition (B*) with $K = 3$  and so we can model it with a DCMM model with $K = 3$.

It would be great if the authors could make more efforts in organizing and presenting the technical in a way more accessible to general ML/AI audience.\n\nThanks  for a very valuable comment.  To respond, we have made the following changes. \n- We have greatly revised Section 2 (Page 4 and Page 5-6, marked in blue) to \ndiscuss the key ideas underlying our proofs. \n- We have added Section L in the supplement to explain the connection between the NMF problem and the social network modeling problem.  Especially, we discuss the impact our results \non modeling $5$ well-known networks: weblog, dolphin, karate, polbooks, and UKFacutly. \n\n**Response to your other points**. You have made the following other points. \n- Section 1.2: ``We also show that in 2 two different cases, (N1)-(N2), Problem (1) is not solvable``: redundancy here?\n-  Section 2:  ``Theorems 2-4 are proved in the supplement`` perhaps say also in which specific section of the supplement?\n-  After Theorem 9: For Case (d))\n-  After Lemma 13: ``This motivates the following algorithm``, could the algorithm be put into an algorithm environment here? or is it just not necessary?\n- More generally, the authors propose to tackle Problem (1) using a construction approach by exploiting Haar and DFT basis. To me this choice of basis may not be unique, could the authors comment on the possible extension of the proposed construction?\n \nThanks for your very careful read and valuable comments. For 1-3: we have revised as suggested. \nFor 4: we can but we didn't do it due to the space constraint. We will try to revise the paper to accommodate that. For 5: this is a very interesting point and for some of the cases, we have indeed proposed different approaches.  For example, consider the case of $K = 2^d$, where $d \\geq 1$ is an integer.  In this case, we can use the Haar construction as in Theorem 6, and we can also use the Haar-DFT combined construction as in Theorem 10. How to extend and combine the proposed approach  to broader cases  is a very interesting research problem for the future work."

                    "value": "The paper studies chiefly the **NIEP** (Non-negative Inverse Eigenvalue Problem). This is something of a pure math question. First, recall that a matrix is _double-stochastic_ if it has non-negative entries, each row sums to 1, and each column sums to 1. Then, for all pairs $(K,m)$ where $K=1,...,\\infty$ and $m = 1,...,m-1$, we want to know if there exists a rotation matrix $Q \\in R^{k \\times k}$ such that $Q J_{K,m} Q^\\intercal$ is double-stochastic, where $J_{K,m} = \\text{diag}(1+\\text{max}\\\\{0,2m-K\\\\}, 1, ...,1, -1, ..., -1)$ is a diagonal matrix with $K$ rows and columns and exactly $m$ many -1's in it.\n\nFor the NIEP, the authors show that a large range of $(K,m)$ pairs either do or do not admit such a matrix $Q$. Many different constructions for such $Q$ are provided, with motivations behind these constructions varying between the _Haar Basis_, the _Discrete Fourier Transform_, a mixture of the Haar Basis and DFT, and _Fielder's Approach_.\n\nSeveral $(K,m)$ pairs are not covered by this analysis, and the authors use a heuristic algorithm to show that some of these pairs likely admit a $Q$ matrix. These are the only experiments in the paper.\n\nThe NIEP is related to the **NMF** (Non-negative Matrix Factorization) Problem. Here, we are given a non-negative rank-$K$ matrix $\\Omega \\in R^{n \\times n}$. We want to find a non-negative tall-and-skinny matrix $\\Pi \\in R^{n \\times K}$ and non-negative diagonal matrix $P\\in R^{K \\times K}$ such that $\\Omega = \\Pi P \\Pi^\\intercal$. This problem is computational, and not a pure math question. By studying these various cases for the NIEP, it becomes clear that NMF is solvable in many regimes with a simple algorithm."

There's a lot of care and precision put into characterizing how to build these $Q$ matrices, and a really wide variety of tools are called in to participate in this task.\n\nNMF is also a problem that's known to be interesting. If I ask around the office, people have heard of it, and know that it matters. So, there's certainly significance in improving our knowledge of when this problem is solvable, and how to solve it.\n\nThe relationship between NIEP and NMF seems to be nice and crisp. A good amount of attention is paid to showing that the authors' solution to the pure math NIEP problem implies simple algorithmic solutions to the NMF problem. This focus on pragmatism in a theoretical paper is also good and appreciated.\n\nThe writing in the paper is clear (though almost always focuses on the wrong subject matter; see \"weaknesses\"). I appreciate the effort taken to represent many different cases in a single paper, though I do believe this somewhat misses the point of what the paper should be trying to convey."

                    "value": "This paper cannot be accepted in its current state. At its core,\n- The paper lacks a clear discussion in its own right that the NIEP and NMF problems are well motivated. There are exactly 2 sentences that motivate the problem studied. Instead of actually motivating the problem, these sentences instead say that someone else wrote down a good motivation. This is vastly insufficient evidence, and the paper should motivate its own problem clearly.\n\n$\\phantom{.}$\n\n- The body of the paper contains many constructions for $Q$ matrices that solve the NIEP for various $(K,m)$ pairs. It does not, however, justify _at all_ why these constructions should work, or **any intuition at all**.\n    - For a theoretical paper, this is devastating. It leaves me with no confidence that the results are correct, and the appendix is out of scope of the typical review. _(I read a bit of the appendix, to get a flavor of Theorem 2 for instance, but it was fairly cold and not laden with any helpful intuition)_\n    - It would be much better to describe constructions in the appendix, and intuitively explain the ideas behind constructions in the body of the paper.\n\nAt the core of the issue of the paper are the above two issues: the paper lacks motivation, and makes no attempt to convince me of its correctness.\n\nA lesser issue is that I do not understand if this paper is a good fit for ICLR, or really any other ML conference. The body of the paper feels a like pure math with a coat of paint on it to give it the rough shape of an ML paper. This harkens back to the motivation a bit (an unmotivated theoretical paper looks like pure math to me), but also the NIEP feels not-ML-like to me. I hesitate to get to gate-keepy about this, so I won't strongly hold this against the paper. A stronger connection to the practice of ML would go a long way.\n\n---\n\nI'll backup my bullet points above with some concrete evidence.\n\nThe two sentences in my first point can be found after problem (2) on page 2. Admittedly, there's some motivating sentences in the conclusion too, but that's far too late and don't actually discuss any additional motivations.\n\nThe lack of intuition and justification can be seen throughout the paper, on pages 2-6 and page 8. The most brutal examples might be the following three:\n- On page 3, the first paragraph of section 1.2 states that 4 different techniques are used to design $Q$ matrices. No explanation for why these methods work is ever given. No discussion of what similar methods would or wouldn't work. No lessons to learn at all.\n- On page 4, Theorems 2, 3, and 4 are all stated without any justification or argument whatsoever. They are simply stated.\n- The top half of page 5 is devoted to define some intricate constructions for $Q$ matrices related to the discrete fourier transform. These constructions are followed by two theorems which state that these $Q$ matrices resolve the NIEP for some $(K,m)$ pairs. No reason connecting the construction to the theorem is given; no reason that these intricate $Q$'s are useful.\n\nI believe that the subject matter of this paper could be published at a good venue. In the current presentation, I cannot accept this to ICLR, and I remain unclear if any ML conference is a good fit. But these seems like good research results that belong in some published venue."

[throughout the paper] Be sure that when you cite someone, you keep parenthesis around the citation. Not having those parenthesis makes a lot of sentences kinda hard to read. (e.g. first sentence of the introduction).\n1. [throughout the paper] The language of NIEP being \"solvable\" is deeply confusing language. In the view of computer science, it's a deterministic problem -- for each $(K,m)$ pair there exactly 1 hardcoded answer, so the problem is \"solvable\". The question is really if $Q$ exists for this particular $(K,m)$ pair, which should not use the word \"solvable\". Instead say something like \"$J_{K,m}$ can be made doubly stochastic\". Or use some other phrase that sounds information-theoretic and not computational.\n1. [throughout the paper] The notation of $4 | K$ is not typical in any literature I've worked in. Define this if your going to use it.\n1. [page 2] Discuss condition (B) more. It's really unintuitive, and looks almost impossible to satisfy at a glance. You describe this as the \"sharpest\" possible bound, but I have no clue what that actually means. Assume your audience hasn't ever seen NMF before, but is interested in learning more about it.\n1. [page 2] Is there a reason to omit the proof of lemma 1 instead of appendicizing it? Why not just appendicize?\n1. [page 2, paragraph before \"The Matrix Q\"] I really like this paragraph. Good paragraph and summary!\n1. [page 4] This \"particularly hard and takes a long time to figure out\" is not really paper-writing-language. I think this is called being \"overly editorialized\". You can call it intricate or something, but really you don't need to include this parenthetical at all. Alternatively, you could actually describe what made the proof so tricky and clever.\n1. [page 4] I think that $H^*$ needs to be composed of $[h_{K,2}, ..., h_{K,m+1}]$ in order for $U$ to be orthogonal?\n1. [page 4] Why include Theorem 6 if its implies by Theorem 10. Just cut theorem 6.\n1. [page 6] The \"the reason why\" sentence really isn't a reason. The sentence doesn't explain why your construction _conceptually_ fails here.\n1. [page 8]  Why do you pick $tr(M \\hat M_0)$ to be the optimization objective? Also, why not use a uniform-at-random orthonormal matrix $\\hat M_0$ -- it's not really going to make a difference in practice but seems more conceptually sound.\n\nDo not assume that the readers know:\n- What the Haar basis matrix is\n- What a Perron root is\n- What the Stiefel manifold is\n\nand be sure to define these terms before you use them."

We hope these changes have explained some of the key ideas in our proofs  and assure you that our proofs are correct and rigorous.\n\nFor your main point (3),  we think being diverse, inclusive, and interdisciplinary is one of the main reasons why ML conferences become so successful in the past decades. \n- It is a win-win to publish papers of this kind in ML conferences: on one hand, we can  attract talented mathematicians to tackle ML problems in areas such as NMF and network analysis,   and on the other hand,  we can enrich mathematics by providing mathematicians with new ideas and new problems.  \n- Both NMF and network analysis are important ML research topics, and \nin the past decades, ML conferences have published many interesting papers in these areas. \nWe have spent almost a whole page (Page 2)  explaining how the problem (i.e., NIEP)  grows out from NMF problem in equation (2), \nand in the appendix (Section L),  we have added discussion on how the NMF problem (2) is motivated by network modeling. \nSee our response to your main point (1) above.\n\n**Response to your other points and minor points**.  Thanks. For your other point: \nwe think they are already addressed in our response to your main points.  For the minor points:  thanks, and we will revise as suggested if not already."
