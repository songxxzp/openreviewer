Hence, the most effective way to generate the response is to use the best model and well-designed prompts.\n\n__W3: In response to the concern about the impact of data augmentation on model interpretability.__\n\nOur augmentation process involves creating variations of the original problems, which, as shown in Figure 1, results in the augmented queries from AugGSM8K having a similar distribution in the model\u2019s latent space as the original GSM8K queries. Generally, in deep learning, more data from the same distribution tends to improve model performance, which is a key reason why models trained on AugGSM8K exhibit superior performance on the original GSM8K dataset.\n\nIn addition, we have conducted an analysis of our model\u2019s performance on test set problems of varying difficulty. Our analysis of the 7B-2 model\u2019s performance on the test set, shows accuracy rates of 0.55, 0.42, and 0.21 for easy, medium, and hard problems, respectively. The MuggleMath model, however, achieved higher accuracy rates of 0.73, 0.70, and 0.64 for the same problem categories.This significant performance boost on difficult questions can be attributed to the fact that the augmented problems we generated are generally more complex than the original problems. \n | Model      | Easy  | Medium | Hard  |\n|------------|-------|--------|-------|\n| 7B-2   SFT    | 0.55  | 0.42   | 0.21  |\n| MuggleMath-7B-2 | 0.73  | 0.70   | 0.64  |\nMoreover, as discussed in Section 4.2 and illustrated in Figure 2, training the model on more challenging problems (those requiring more reasoning steps) and on problems it initially solved incorrectly leads to a more efficient improvement in the model\u2019s mathematical abilities. This observation mirrors the way humans tend to benefit from practicing more difficult math problems and learning from their mistakes. \n\n__W4: In response to the concern about  computational efficiency of our methodology.__\n\nDuring the data generation phase, which includes the generation of queries and responses, the cost associated with using the GPT-3.5-turbo API is 0.002 dollars per 1k tokens, and for the GPT-4 API, the price is 0.03 dollars per 1k input tokens and 0.06 dollars per 1k output tokens. As shown in Table 1, the creation of the 10 versions of AugGSM8K resulted in a total expenditure of 4057.2 dollars. Specifically, in Table 4 for MuggleMath in Table 4, the cost for data generation amounted to 2508.9 dollars.\n\nIn the training phase, to train the models that achieved the results presented in Table 4 for MuggleMath, the computational resources utilized were as follows: the 7B, 7B-2, and 13B-2 models were trained on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 5.5 hours, 5.5 hours, and 13.5 hours, respectively. For the 70B-2 model, we trained on 32 NVIDIA A100 GPUs for 20 hours, which will be updated in the paper."

As for the novelty and scientific contributions of our paper, we would like to highlight that our work builds on the advantages of previous works such as RFT (response augmentation) and WizardMath (query augmentation), which have been widely recognized and cited in the LLM community. Our study not only achieved the best performance among all open-source models on the GSM8K dataset but also provided an analysis of scaling laws and out-of-distribution generalization. This analysis can offer valuable insights to the community when using data augmentation methods to enhance models' mathematical reasoning abilities.\n\nFor W2, we have taken your advice and add more ML generalization paper to related works.  Moreover, we have changed the conclusion to \"apply augmentations on diverse math subjects\". \n\nFor W3, we consider scaling laws during fine-tuning augmented dataset is useful for deliver a specific ability (like math reasoning or coding) to users. And another finding here is augmenting using model-generated samples and using human-written samples have similar scaling trend which is very interesting for who want to improve the model based on model itself.\n\nFor Q1, we use the 15-th layer of last token representation in the problem."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's review.\n\nFor W1, we acknowledge the work of Yu et al. 2023 \u201cMetaMath: Bootstrap Your Own Mathematical Questions for Large Language Models\u201d, which was indeed contemporaneous with our own research. Their paper was uploaded to arxiv on September 21, 2023, merely a day before our submission to ICLR. Consequently, our work was conducted independently and without the influence of Yu et al.'s findings. Our paper shares similar contributions with that of Yu et al. in terms of query and response enhancement methods and the analysis of scaling relationships. However, we have conducted further analysis on the generalizability of data augmentation techniques.\n\nFor W2, our paper\u2019s title, \u201cQuery and Response Augmentation Cannot Help Out-of-Domain Math Reasoning Generalization,\u201d is primarily based on our findings that applying query and response augmentation to the GSM8K dataset resulted in negligible and inconsistent performance improvements on the MATH dataset.  There has been substantial research on Out-of-Domain (OOD) issues, and we will include a discussion of this literature in the related work section of our manuscript. Since data augmentation has demonstrated exceptional performance in large model math reasoning, but its generalizability has not been studied before, our paper provides a preliminary analysis of the generalizability of these methods. We believe this will offer some new insights to the community. To further investigate how the data augmentation performed on GSM8K affects different domains of mathematics, we conducted an additional analysis on the accuracy across various subsets of the MATH dataset. \n\nFor W3, the reasoning paths are sampled by GPT3.5 or GPT4, which is discussed in section 3.2 and section 4.1. The prompt used for reasoning path generation is listed in appendix C and a case study can be seen in Table 13. \n\nFor Q1 and Q2, while there is an overlap in the embedding space distribution between MATH and GSM8K, it is relatively small compared with that between GSM8K and AugGSM8K. In the transfer learning setting, training first on GSM8K and then on MATH with LLaMA-13B-2 does provide some benefits for certain subsets, such as Prealgebra, Algebra, and Geometry. However, if we train first on AugGSM8K and then on MATH, this benefit is not only marginal but may even lead to a decrease in performance on other subsets, like Geometry and Prealgebra, which could be related to the data proportions. Overall, the performance improvement on the MATH dataset from augmentation on GSM8K is minimal, even on subsets like Prealgebra, where there is some overlap. For 7B size and multi-task learning setting, we can draw the similar conclusion. Complete comparison will be listed in appendix H. \n| Subject               | math | GSM8K | +${\\mathcal{D}_1^1}$ |+$\\sum_{i=1}^{3}{\\mathcal{D}_1^i}+\\mathcal{D}_2^1 +\\mathcal{D}_3^1$  |\n|-----------------------|------|-------|------------|------------|\n| Counting & Probability | 10.5 |  13.2 |     7.9    |     5.3    |\n| Algebra               | 7.3  |  12.1 |    12.9    |    16.9    |\n| Prealgebra            | 8.5  |  13.4 |     8.5    |    11.0    |\n| Geometry              | 2.4  |   9.8 |     4.9    |     2.4    |\n| Intermediate Algebra  | 6.2  |   5.2 |     3.1    |     5.2    |\n| Number Theory         | 3.2  |   6.5 |     6.5    |     8.1    |\n| Precalculus           | 3.6  |   5.4 |     7.1    |     7.1    |\n\n\nFor Q3, in our approach to query augmentation, we took inspiration from the common pedagogical practice where human learners engage in \u201cvaried practice\u201d training to enhance their mathematical problem-solving skills.
