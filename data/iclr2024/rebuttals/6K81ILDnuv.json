I do not see it being a contribution in any meaningful way.\n\n- Could the authors elaborate on the \"deterministic sampling strategy\": why are you allowed to choose $p(x'|x)$? As it is written, one is most likely to infer that $p(x'|x)$ is defined by the problem itself.\n\n- Regarding the \"the double-sampling trick\", the authors write \"the uncorrelation between $g_\\theta(x_1')$ and $g_\\theta(x_1')$\nwill remove the induced bias on average\". How come? Could the authors formally show this in the response?\n\n- For \"the delayed target method\": could the authors elaborate how come (19) holds, in particular, the details regarding the \"cross\"-term. Also, why does (20) follow? Modulo already a lot of technical assumptions the authors non-rigorously omit, one might easily come up scenario when the set of stationaries of one objective is strictly included in the set of stationary points of the second objective. This, in turn, means that sets of minimizers do not necessarily coincide. Why such scenario does not happen here?\n\n- The authors write \"theoretically showed that naive approximations of the parametrized integrals lead to biased loss functions due to\nthe induced excess variance term in the optimization objective\" - this is a bit of a stretch. I have not encountered any formal statement in this paper. In the absence of it, such justification is a mere \"heuristics\". Could authors point out the rigorous result they are referring to?"

To overcome these restrictions, authors proposed an alternative approach which can be more effective than reducing the variance of the integral estimations. Also, they considered three potential approaches to do this; the deterministic sampling approach, the double-sampling trick, and the delayed target method. Authors also looked at three classes of PDEs to check proposed approach."

At the same time, some of them do not seem to work very well with the benchmark problems and it is a bit hard to find what would be a take-away message. For example, double-trick does seem to work for the Maxwell problem, but struggles with Poisson problems (Figure 2).  Also, the results of them are not provided for the third benchmark problem. The delayed target method seems to work well with the first two example problems, but for the third problem, it\u2019s hard to see if the proposed one does better than the standard one. In particular, by looking at the training loss curve, it does seem that the proposed method produces higher loss (or is it a coloring issue?). Although there is a small paragraph of recommendation and limitation at the end, it only mentions the delayed target method and it is still less convincing due to the reasons above described. \n\n- The authors provided in-depth ablation studies on the Poisson problem, which can be considered as strength. However, it\u2019s less clear if these findings from the one benchmark problem would also generalize to other intro-DE problems. It would be better if the authors could provide some insights or some paragraph describing tips to set up those hyper-parameters.\n\n- Discussion on computational aspects would also be needed. Computational wall-time would be the best, but at least some discussions on flops would be okay.\n\n- Although the paper is well-structured (section-wise), there are some room for improvements for the presentation.  \n\n     - It seems that there should be some break after Eq. (9). Right after Eq. (9) is the description of a loss term for all three examples. \n\n     - Figure 2 describes the results of the delayed target method, but the text reads differently in one place: Page 5 in the paragraph of \u201cThe deterministic sampling strategy\u201d, \u201cFor a demonstration, Figure 2 shows a number of example sets used for applying the divergence theorem to the Poisson problem.\u201d. Also, in Figure 2, is the pointer to Eq. 24 correct? \n\n     - Figure 6: it\u2019s hard to interpret the figure on the right panel. \n\n     - Recommendation and limitations paragraph: Figure 2 seems to show the performance of the model for varying $M$, not about $\\gamma$ or $\\lambda$. Should $M$ be interpreted as the hyper-parameters of the proposed methods like $\\gamma$ or $\\lambda$? $M$ does seem to be a problem-specific parameter. Does this suggest that there can be other problem-specific parameters which needs to be tuned when one want to use the algorithm? \n\n     - The placement of Figures would require many back-and-forth, which makes it difficult to focus. \n\n     -  Conclusion: there is an incomplete sentence: \u201cThe delayed target method.\u201d \n\n     - Table 3, is it SiLU? Or Tanh? I think there is a mismatch in the text and the table entry."
