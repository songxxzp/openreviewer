                    "value": "In this study, the authors introduce a novel method for continual self-supervised learning, termed \"AugNeg\". This approach generates an increased number of negative examples, utilizing the encoding derived from the previous model. Demonstrating versatility, the proposed method exhibits enhancements across three distinct settings. Furthermore, the authors integrate this method with non-contrastive learning methods, adapting it into a regularization term."

Continual self-supervised learning stands as a promising field of research, offering the substantial benefit of potentially reducing computational resource requirements.\n2. The proposed method appears to be soundness. By generating a greater number of negative examples, particularly those derived from the previous model, it is anticipated that the quality of the representations will be enhanced.\n3. The structure of this paper is commendably clear and logical, facilitating ease of understanding and follow-through for readers."

                    "value": "1. There is a significant discrepancy in performance between the proposed method and standard joint training. It raises the question of whether the proposed method offers any resource savings compared to conventional training approaches. Additionally, it's pertinent to question why a user would choose to sample exclusively from current task data instead of the entire dataset.\n\n2. The primary goal of continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) is to conserve resources, for instance, by reducing the need for large mini-batch sizes. However, it's crucial to determine whether the proposed method maintains its efficacy in datasets with an extensive array of classes, such as ImageNet-1K.\n\n3. Augmentation represents a crucial area of exploration in Self-supervised learning. Given that the authors classify their method as a form of augmentation, it becomes essential to engage in comparisons and discussions with existing augmentation methods [1][2][3]. \n\n[1] ReSSL: Relational Self-Supervised Learning with Weak Augmentation, NeurIPS 2021. \\\n[2] RSA: Reducing Semantic Shift from Aggressive Augmentations for Self-supervised Learning, NeurIPS 2022. \\\n[3] Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners, CVPR 2022."

I've spent some of my time to help the authors to improve it the last time and they do not even find enough time to do the good text replacement from Sy-con to AugNeg. \nMain changes: They've removed one unfavorable plot (CaSSLe was always better on it for two out of three methods) and add Table 2, changed Fig.4, added \"SyCON (BYOL)\" **(!) (authors own writting)**, and added why the cannot reproduce CaSSLe results (Challenges of reproducing CaSSLe\u2019s results - I've checked the issue page as well, 2% changed at the end in #12). \n\n1. Improvements presented in Table 1 (CSSL baselines) \u2013 taking into account the results variability is not always significant (see std. dev. reported there for AugNeg vs CaSSLe).\n\n1. The results for CaSSLe are still lower from ones presented in the original paper. The pointed issue on the github is mainly about BYOL method. \n\n1. For a good comparison in Fig.4 the right figure should be MoCo with just finetuning. We can then compare all three methods better and can be a good sanity check. Right now, what we can say is that AugNeg hurts the performance on the first task a bit (why?) and is better in the following. Do we have the same queue size and all hyper-params here between the methods? (see my questions).\n\n1. There is no clear message why AugNeg works in each of the scenario with each method (MoCo / BYOL)."

However, the authors only selected two SSL methods, though with exploratory experiments on CIFAR-100, to compare with the baselines. It is worth noting that different SSL methods may have different effects on different CSSL settings and datasets. The goal of various SSL methods is to demonstrate that the loss can universally improve CSSL, given any existing SSL methods and potentially future methods.\n2. The presentation of the paper needs to be improved, as most of the captions of the tables and figures do not contain useful information.\n3. The loss needs a more intuitive explanation. From the current presentation, it seems like the design lacks meaning and is more of an engineer labor. See the question below."

Are the current negative samples in $\\mathcal{L}1$ (previous negative samples in $\\mathcal{L}2$) so extensively utilized that the inclusion of the negative samples from another source is necessary? If this is indeed the case, could it be attributed to the scale of the dataset? The variable \n\n$z_{i,t} = Proj(h_{\\theta_t}(x_i))$ \n\nin CaSSLe is designed for the invariant feature of the current and previous tasks. Does this apply to the proposed algorithms as well? In section 3.4, why does the addition of an extra regularization term follow a similar principle to that of the previous section?"
