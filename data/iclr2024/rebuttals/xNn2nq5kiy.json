But it is very confusing that how models are asked to generate such plans. My understanding is that some of them require model training (But the authors claim that they are doing the zero-shot evaluation) while some are human crafted. And this part is not well aligned with the experiment section, I cannot fully understand the experimental setup and details. I suggest the authors make those sections more clear and well-structured.\n2. Planning based method for text generation has been widely studied. I have listed a few below, but I believe there are more. And many of them have explored automatic planning generation. It seems that this paper highly replies on human designed prompting for planning, and some plans even require human writing (learned plan). So the novelty of this paper is very limited.\n3. Experiments are difficult to follow as well. The authors propose 4 prompting methods  (Per-cite, Sentence by sentence, plan-based, and learned plan), but in some experimental results, they only show part of the results.\nFor example, in table 2, they experiment 4 methods for Turbo, but only 1 for GPT-4. And what does the \"GPT-4 (Plan)\" mean? does it refer to \"GPT-4 plan-based\"? Overall, it is very difficult to follow and compare their results.\n\n\n\nLLM Blueprint: Enabling Text-to-Image Generation with Complex and Detailed Prompts\n\nDynamic Planning with a LLM\n\nSkeleton-of-Thought: Large Language Models Can Do Parallel Decoding\n\nSelf-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models"

This process could potentially lead to leakage of ground-truth information, resulting in generated texts that closely mirror the organization of the ground truth and, consequently, attain artificially high ROUGE scores.\n3. **Limitations of Performance Evaluation** \n   - The paper asserts that the proposed plan-based method can reduce hallucination in the generated output. However, the manuscript lacks both quantitative and qualitative evidence from human evaluations or automated metrics to substantiate this claim. \n   - While the paper employs general-level automated evaluation systems like ROUGE and GPT judgment (without cited references as input), incorporating additional metrics that specifically assess the faithfulness of the generated text could strengthen the evaluation framework. \n   - The setting and results of human evaluation is absent"

The technical contributions beyond prompting are not extensively detailed. The proposed data corpus, while valuable for the current study, may quickly become outdated due to the rapid evolution of LLMs. \n\n(3) Problematic Evaluation: The automatic evaluation relies on ROUGE metrics, which may not be fully indicative of the text's factual accuracy or the presence of hallucinations. \n\n(4) Lack of Insightful Conclusions: The conclusions drawn from the study do not extend into broader implications.\n\nTypo:  We address this key problem by operating in the setting were LLMs are prompted to only use information from a specific set of actual papers to be cited\u2026 were \u2192 where\n\nTypo: related works \u2192 related work"
