                    "value": "In this paper, the authors introduce a novel semantic watermark for large language models named SemStamp. Only sentences that lie within a valid region of the feature space can be sampled during generation. Concurrently, they introduce a stronger paraphrasing scheme by generating sentences with minimal bigram overlap compared to the original. Experiments demonstrate that SemStamp exhibits greater robustness against both the baseline and the proposed paraphrase attacks than the baseline watermark."

This could pose issues when there are multiple keys/users, as there might be a need for correction during detection, such as the Bonferroni correction. Reliable detection requires the method to yield a notably low p-value. It would be beneficial if the authors could present some plots between the number of sentences and the z-scores/p-values.\n- As the authors acknowledge, SemStamp demands significantly more generation time than preceding watermarks."

Here are our clarifications to the points you mentioned:\n\n### **Z-score**\n\nReviewer is very considerate in asking us to provide z-scores. The reason why we choose AUROC is that it measures the relative tradeoff between false positive rate and true positive rate. Various AI detection literature apply AUROC to evaluate the robustness of methods (Kirchenbauer et al 2023b, Mitchell et al 2023). Namely, while true positive texts have a lower z-score, false positive texts also exhibit a lower z-score, cancelling the low score effects. Therefore, AUROC already does the equivalent of something like Bonferroni Correction for us.\n\n### **Robustness to unseen datasets**\n\nThis is a great point! We made up experiments and please see our general response.\n\n### **TP@FP=1%**\n\nSame as above, we\u2019ve made up experiments and please see results in the general response section.\n\nWe will be happy to address any additional concern you might have!"

                    "value": "The paper proposes a watermarking for large language models. The idea behind the method is to watermark a semantic meaning instead of just words, as the prior art does. The watermark is embedded in transformed key-dependent domain, which is a classic trick in watermarking (see for example [1]). The embedding by rejection sampling is a novel feature, though the rejection sampler can have very poor efficiency and allows to embed very small watermark. While the text is not specific about the length of the watermark, I believe it is to  be equal to the number of LSH projections, which is equal to two in experimental settings (paragraph about speed on page 8). This means that the rejection sampler have high success to embed, but the watermarking scheme can suffer from a high false positive rate. This does not seem to be true, since the AUC seems to be high. I would welcome this to be better clarified.\n\nThe major problem of the watermarking scheme is that the effect of watermarking is \"big\". Since the watermark is hidden in the semantic domain, it effectively prevents generating answers with some semantic meaning. This gives the watermark robustness against paraphrasing, but in my opinion the degradation is so severe that the scheme will be useless in practice. This is visible in Figure 5, where the watermarked text is less useful then the non-watermarked.\n\nOverall, I like the idea to hide the watermark in the transformed domain, this brings the work closer to methods used to watermark digital images. But the execution in the text domains is more difficult than shown in the presented text.\n\nI would welcome if authors acknowledge of existence watermarking techniques predating large-language model boom, which exist and are apparently forgotten [2,3].\n\n[1] Bas, Patrick, and Fran\u00e7ois Cayre. \"Natural watermarking: a secure spread spectrum technique for woa.\" International Workshop on Information Hiding.

I think this renders the scheme useless.\n* The length of the watermaking seems to be small. Since the watermark is hidden by rejection sampler, the length of the watermark has to be sufficiently small to make the rejection sampler efficient, which at the same time makes the false positive rate high. Notice that practical watermarking scheme should have false positive rates in order 10^-5 or 10^-6, because most of text is watermarked. You should report detection accuracy at this rate. FPrate 5% means the user will be constantly flooded with false alarms. Again, this is inherent weakness of the scheme, which renders it practically useless."

                        "value": "Dear reviewer GzBM,\n\nThank you for time and feedback! Here are our clarifications:\n\n### **Watermark Length**:\n\nReviewer mentions several times about the length of watermark and the idea of embedding \u201csmall\u201d watermark. However, SemStamp does not involve any \u201clength of watermark\u201d. It only embeds the 1-bit information that \u201cthis generation is watermarked\u201d. SemStamp works by rejection sampling to sample a valid sentence. It treats sentence as the basic unit of watermarking, but there is no such concept as \u201clength\u201d in our scheme. We will dearly appreciate if the reviewer can further clarify what they mean by \u201clength\u201d.\n\n### **Semantic Diversity**:\n\nReviewer thinks because the watermark operates in semantic domain, it limits semantic diversity of generations. Regarding generation diversity, evaluation with rep-ngram and text entropy in Table 2 shows that SemStamp does not significantly curtail text diversity. The intuitive explanation here is that each valid semantic region is large enough to allow sufficient diversity. \n\n### **Estimation of false positive rate**:\n\nTo estimate, we also input 1000 human text generations during detection phase. We iterate through a range of z-scores and respectively find the percentage of human texts incorrectly classified as machine texts (thus false positives), fixing on the z score corresponding to the desired false positive rate.\n\nFor evaluation of robustness under a smaller false positive rate, please see our general response where we show results under FPR=1%.\n\n### **Acknowledging watermarking techniques predating LLM boom**\n\nWe really appreciate reviewer for bringing great insights and being very considerate in recommending additional papers for us to acknowledge, which we will gratefully include in our manuscripts."

The length of the watermark is the number of bits the watermark can carry. This is zero in your case, which makes a perfect sense.\n\nI do not agree with authors that semantic watermarking does not affect the diversity of generated text. If the watermark divides the semantic space into regions, that the semantic diversity has to be restricted. I cannot imagine this not to happen. I do think distribution of n-grams (or entropy) is a misleading measure of diversity, because it measures distribution of \"groups of \" characters, which is not correlated with a distribution of semantic meaning.\n\nI acknowledge reading the TP@FPR. How the 1000 sentences to estimate distribution of normal text were created? What was their semantic distribution?"

It is unclear how the paraphrase would be used in practice.\n\n2. The main concern is the baseline method still achieves reasonably good performance against bigram. Thus, the need for the proposed method is not well motivated.\n\n3. The improvement on the robustness also seems to be marginal.\n\n4. The evaluation is limited. How about the robustness against fine-tuning, prompt-tuning, and watermark overwriting? The paper can also benefit from making the evaluation metrics of stealthiness, efficiency and robustness more clear."

                        "value": "Dear reviewer ouFD,\n\nThank you for the great insights and advice to our paper! Here are our clarifications:\n\n### **Goal of watermarking**\n\nOur watermarking scheme is not aimed at intellectual property protection, but to facilitate the detection of machine-generated texts through embedding an imperceptible pattern during generation and attempting to reproduce this pattern during detection time. On the other hand, a malicious actor can conduct attacks through removing such watermark embedded during generations, preventing detectors to reproduce this pattern. One common attack is through paraphrasing generations on sentence-level to remove watermarks, which is what our algorithms are robust against.\n\n### **Baseline against bigram-attacks**\n\nReviewer thinks that \u201cbaseline method still achieves reasonably good performance\u201d against bigram attacks. For instance, under parrot bigram paraphrase attack, the auroc of baseline drops from 0.915 (without bigram attack) to 0.875, and its true positive rate drops from 62.9% to 45.4% when the false positive rate is at 1% (TP@FP=1%), and from 78.7% to 65.8% on TP@FP=5%, which is arguably not a good performance.  Likewise, SemStamp\u2019s improvement on robustness is quite significant. Under bigram-attacks by different paraphrasers, SemStamp on average has higher TP@FP=5% than the baseline by around 0.15, which improves by at least 20%.\n\n### **Evaluation**\n\nWe kindly ask the reviewer to clarify how \u201cfine-tuning, prompt-tuning, and watermark overwriting\u201d is related to our work. Since the focus of this paper is on developing a specific paraphrase-robust watermark, we do not assert general robustness against all types of attacks. \n\nIn terms of efficiency, in Table 3, we measure the average number of sampled sentences to produce one valid sentence. For robustness, we studied SemStamp\u2019s performance under different paraphrasers, different generation lengths, and different text domains (see general response section). For stealthiness, we\u2019ve shown in Table 2 that SemStamp generations do not exhibit obvious qualitative differences from vanilla generations."
