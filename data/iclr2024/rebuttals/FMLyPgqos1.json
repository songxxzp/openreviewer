                    "value": "The paper proposes a novel personalized federated learning framework called Panacea, which is composed of a GNN encoder, an MLP, and a graph generator. In each communication round, the GNN encoder first refines client embeddings based on initial embedding and client relationship. Then, the MLP generates next round client parameters with refined embedding. Finally, the graph generator further preserves local preferences of each client through reconstruction. Empirical studies were performed to verify the effectiveness of the method."

It seems that this work relies on human-designed client relationships and embeddings, which may be hard to realize in real-world scenarios.\n2.\tThe assumption of the existence and accessibility of client graph is not very compatible with the experiment setting. As for unseen novel clients and malicious clients, it is typically unable to know their relationship with other normal clients (or only know incorrect relationship).  So how to exploit client relationship in these cases?\n3.\tThe claim in the Lemma 3.1 part is not quite persuasive. From my perspective, the graph you adopt is not a weighted graph. Then if all the nodes are connected in the clique graph, the embedding of one node is just a plain average of all embeddings. How to fully recover the client embeddings just based on these average values? A more detailed explanation is needed here."

However, it does not introduce any specific techniques to address potential issues, such as the high computational cost associated with graph-based learning.\n2.\tThe experiment utilizes manually constructed graphs, which may not naturally exist in the dataset. This introduces the possibility of inaccurate graphs and additional noise, potentially impacting the evaluation and diminishing support for the claim of effective personalization modeling through graph-based hypernetwork approaches."
