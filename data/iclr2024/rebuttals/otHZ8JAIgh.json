This is to be appreciated by any fellow researchers looking to get understanding of the available survival prediction methods in CPath.\n- Probabilistic modeling of the bag of patch features (although it leads to several variational approximations), opens up new avenues for probabilistic approaches for CPath, which have been under-explored thus far."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Clarity\n- The explanation around PIB and PID need to be much more straightforward for the work to be appreciated. In its current form, it is really hard to understand and Section 3 lacks clarity. The authors should understand that typical readership of this article will either be pathologist or ML practitioner who would be less-versed in probabilistic and variational language. This, in my opinion, significantly reduces the impact of the paper as any other researcher hoping to reuse the framework for their own experiments. Authors should try to inject more  pathology-related intuition throughout the work.\n\nDiscriminative assumption\n-  I am not sure if \"discriminative\" approach (despite its good performance as shown in the paper) is the right approach for survival. Different from diagnosis problems where subtype/grades are indeed decided with discriminative instances (patches), survival prediction problems are not as clear-cut. Certain morphological characteristics will overlap between different risk groups (or bands), which the current approach, centered around sampling positive/negative prototypes for maximum discrimination, is not well suited for.\n- Related to the comment above, this approach seems only applicable to NLL loss, which treats the problem as a classification problem and thus have \"different\" bins (i.e., discretized timeline). What if more common loss functions, such as Cox PH or rank losses, were to be used that do not rely on such discriminative hypothesis?\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis\n- In Kaplan-Meier analysis section, authors state that \"our approach demonstrates significantly improved discrimination.... as indicated by lower p-values\". While it is tempting to compare between p-values as a metric for separation of the risk groups, it is statistically not correct. Once these are below significance threshold, it shouldn't be over-interpreted. Maybe, use median survival days for each risk group?\n\nSampling operation\n- Since both PID and PIB rely on sampling from distribution, it does seem that the performance will indeed by affected by which samples are chosen or how many of them are sampled. The discussion around this point needs to be made explicit.\n\nInference\n- While there are detailed information about training procedure, not much is written about the actual inference step. For instance, how many samples for each prototype are required for reliable performance?"

(6) - Can't we simply use KL divergence to assess the similiarity (distance), if both p(z|x) and p(\\hat{z}|y) are normal distributions?\n- Usually the use of \"Top-k\" refers to small number of instances being selected. However, from implementation section, it seems the authors are using 50~80% of the entire bag? Am I misunderstanding something?"

In the following, your comments are first stated and then followed by our point-by-point responses.\n\n---\n> **Q1) Clarity. The clarity of the PIB and PID explanations, particularly in Section 3, needs improvement for broader appreciation. The introduction of Markov chains confuses the paper more - Perhaps better to remove it.**\n> \n\nIn response to your valuable feedback, we have revised **Section 3** of the paper. The modifications include removing the introduction to Markov chains, emphasizing the changes made by the new approach more straightforward for conciseness and clarity. \n\n---\n> **Q2) Discriminative assumption.  1. The suitability of a \"discriminative\" approach for survival prediction. 2. The proposed approach seems only applicable to NLL loss. What if more common loss functions, such as Cox PH or rank losses, were to be used that do not rely on such discriminative hypothesis?**\n> \n1. We agree that survival prediction problems present greater complexity than diagnosis. In practical scenarios, there may exist deciding biomarkers within different risk bands, which leads to the \u201cdiscriminative\u201d method having demonstrated good performances in many cases [1,2].  Although some instances **related** to different risk groups may exhibit some overlap, these overlapping instances may not significantly contribute to **distinguishing** risk bands. Similarly, the same situation of overlapping can be observed in subtyping/grading as well. Therefore, our method, through the use of prototypes, excels in identifying discriminative features that are specifically associated with the positive risk level. Hence, discriminative assumption may not be a weakness but an advantage for biomarker discovery of different risk levels.\n\n2. Indeed, the prototype learning in the current approach primarily relies on cross-entropy(CE)-like loss. This is because the prototypes are constructed based on information bottleneck theory, in which the first term of the derivation in Eq. (8) is formulated as a form of cross-entropy. Fortunately, NLL loss, a CE-like loss, makes it feasible to employ IB for survival prediction task. \n    \n    Although the prototype component is based on CE-like loss, the task loss in our framework is still flexible and can be easily switched to Cox or rank loss. Furthermore, even in rank-based losses, which focus on relative comparisons between samples, discriminative information is still needed. Although not directly involving classification, the model needs to learn the differences between samples to correctly rank them. Hence, the assumption of PIB may not conflict in such scenarios.\n    \n    Despite the discriminative hypothesis, this work first attempts to directly model the bag-level representations for a bag structure through the probabilistic model in survival prediction task. There is undoubtedly significant value in expanding this approach to various hypotheses like rank-based hypothesis. Hence, further investigation is still warranted in the future.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] Echle A, Rindtorff N T, Brinker T J, et al.

Beyond ABMIL and TransMIL, other strong unimodal methods such as the task-specific finetuning variant of CLAM is also considered. Background information and literature is also extensive, with many important studies related to PIBD cited in a comprehensive manner.\n- The proposed PID and PIB methodology, though largely adapted and inspired by other IB applications in computational pathology such as that of Li et al. 2023, is (on balance) appropriate for its extension into survival analysis w.r.t. addressing sparsity of patch features in MIL via prototypes. Figure 1 is informative and communciates how PID/PIB are used."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- **Limited findings w.r.t. clinical application / multimodal interpretability**: PID/PIB is intuitive for solving multimodal integration problems of WSIs and gene sets, but the demonstrated findings of this work appears limited to only improvement of c-Index performance. Methodologies such as MOTCat and SurvPath, though not approaching survival analysis from an information bottleneck perspective, similarly resolve issues regarding redundancy of patch features in MIL and reach similar findings already established in prior works. The interpretability experiments, shown as attention heatmaps in the supplement, are difficult to interpret and draw conclusions from. As the improvement in c-Index is minor, it would be valuable to investigate the interpretability of PIBD, for example: (1) performing local and global interpretability to assess individual and cohort-level image-omic drivers of disease survival, or (2) experiment+showcase unique clinical applications that would arise from PIBD that cannot be performed in other methods, which would produce new scientific findings and expand this study's significance. In particular, I found the prototypical aspect of this work to be intriguing, with concurrent works also realizing (and finding new applications) of using prototypical patterns for pathology [5].\n- **Ablation Experiments for PIB/PID**: Some baselines do not seem fair in the PID/PIB ablation experiments.\n- - In ablating PID, the baseline model considered was average pooling the prototypical features - a more appropriate baseline would be to use a non-disentangled Transformer like TransMIL on top of the prototypical features. \n- - In ablating PIB, the reviewer is not certain what the baseline looks like (using PID without PIB), but would think that this comparison would be similar to having each modality being processed by a TransMIL-like encoder + PID (or SurvPath + PID). \n- **Using CTransPath for TCGA evaluation**: A limitation of this study is the usage of CTransPath (pretrained on TCGA) for training and evaluating MIL models for survival analysis in TCGA. Understandably, access to powerful pretrained encoders for pathology is challenging, due to: (1) lack of computing power, and (2) lack of diverse and independent data outside of TCGA, with other studies in computational pathology such as Jaume et al. [1] and Filliot et al. [2] having also conducted survival analyses via TCGA-pretrained encoders. This limitation could remain as \"a limitation of this study\" (fitted in the conclusion) as the novelties of this work are with respect to the MIL encoder (all comparisons are performed using the same features and evaluated in the same way), in combination with the aforementioned challenges in computational pathology. However, as the broader pathology and machine learning community is becoming more aware of potential biases that emerge from data contamination of self-supervised models that are also trained using the evaluation data (as seen in LLMs and other studies [3-7]), it is important for advances going forward to recognize and resolve this issue and to develop better standardization for developing and evaluating MIL methods. \n\nReferences\n1.

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive comments and suggestions, they are greatly beneficial in enhancing the quality of our paper. We hope our answers will address the concerns and clarify the contributions of the paper. In the following, your comments are first stated and then followed by our point-by-point responses.\n\n---\n> **Q1) Limited findings w.r.t. clinical application / multimodal interpretability**\n> \n\nThank you for your feedback and suggestions! In order to present the concerns in a more organized manner, we will state our response point-by-point.\n\n**Contribution**. We'd like to emphasize the contributions of our method, as highlighted by Reviewers bKh7, HNZs, and G86X. Our approach achieves innovation by reducing redundant information within and between modalities for survival prediction through the information bottleneck in a quite novel prototypical method. Methods like MOTCat and SurvPath, which utilize co-attention mechanisms, focus specifically on gene-related instances of WSIs, emphasizing modality-common information. They failed to address the issues that we\u2019re concerned about in the following aspects. First, these approaches ignored the distinct value of modality-specific information. Second, helpful instances in a bag only occupy an extremely small portion, which means massive intra-modal redundancy. Without explicit redundancy removal, such as MOTCat and Survpath, useful information will be flooded. Lastly, they cannot directly model at the bag-level, as noted by Reviewer G86X, \"probabilistic modeling on bags opens up new avenues for probabilistic approaches for CPath, which have been under-explored thus far.\u201d\n\n**Interpretability**. For local interpretability of individual patients, we have visualized similarity scores of instances to each prototype of risk level and presented top-3 relevant patches and biological pathways, as well as top-3 irrelevant biological pathways. Through analyzing these instances, we may discover biomarkers of various risk levels. This is because prototypes are designed to be discriminative, which enforces selecting instances that are most distinctive for each risk level, potentially corresponding to biomarkers for different risk levels. In addition to what we have done, another potential way is to analyze the modality-specific features extracted from PID using CAM-based approaches, which will facilitate the discovery of unique biomarkers within each modality.\n\nSince prototypes represent the distribution for each risk band, they inherently possess a global nature. As a result, the global interpretability can be demonstrated in the following aspects. First, by collecting and organizing instances with high similarity to prototypes across a large patient cohort, we can assess cohort-level disease survival. Second, in PID, the joint distribution of histology and genomic data containing modality-common information, contributes to identifying paired instances related to both modalities and further establishing their relationship between patches and pathways. This also helps to understand their collaborative mechanisms.\n\n**Clinical applications.** We truly appreciate your suggestions and believe that the aforementioned way to interpret the model has the potential to provide some clinical value. However, the investigation of clinical applications requires collaborative efforts from experts across disciplines, such as pathologists, statisticians, AI experts, etc. For example, interpretability in clinical applications demands extensive review of pathology slides by pathologists and continuous enhancements in algorithms by AI engineers[1-3]. Therefore, it definitely takes a lot of time and effort in development and elaboration, which has gone beyond the scope of the current work. This work still primarily focuses on technical innovation in methodology. We acknowledge the importance of clinical applications, and we will continue to explore this area and hope to report the findings soon.\n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1] Hosseini, Mahdi S., et al. \"Computational Pathology: A Survey Review and The Way Forward.\"\u00a0*arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.05482*\u00a0(2023).\n\n[2] Berb\u00eds, M.

The calculated joint distribution gives guidance for extracting modality-common and modality-specific information. \n\n---\n> **Q3) How does PIB save the computation?\u00a0Please make quantitative analysis.**\n> \n\nThank you for your feedback. For the computation efficiency of PIB, it can be known that directly employing VIB would lead to intractable bag-level distribution $p(z|\\bf{x})$ due to the large number of individual instance distributions within a bag $\\bf{x}$, based on the analysis in the second paragraph **on Page 5**.  The proposed PIB can simplify this issue by modeling bag-level distribution with prototypes.\n\nWe can coarsely quantify the reduction in computational complexity compared to the original VIB. Assuming the sampling frequency is $K$, the number of samples per iteration is $N$, and there are $M$ instances of $D$-dimension in a bag, the computational complexity is $O(K\\cdot N\\cdot M\\cdot D)$. However, in PIB, we only need to sample from prototypes. Assume that the number of prototypes is $P$, the complexity becomes  $O(K\\cdot N\\cdot P\\cdot D)$, where $P << M$. For example, P is 8 in our work, while M is usually larger than 10,000."

The results are added in **Table 1, Page 8**, and are also shown in the table below. \n\n| Methods | BRCA | BLCA | COADREAD | HNSC | STAD | Overall |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SNNTrans | 0.679(0.053) | 0.583(0.060) | 0.739(0.124) | 0.570(0.035) | 0.547(0.041) | 0.622 |\n| CLAM-MB | 0.696(0.098) | 0.623(0.045) | 0.721(0.159) | 0.620(0.034) | 0.648(0.050) | 0.662 |\n| SNNTrans+CLAM-MB(naive combination) | 0.699(0.064) | 0.625(0.060) | 0.716(0.160) | 0.638(0.066) | 0.629(0.065) | 0.661 |\n| PIBD | **0.736(0.072)** | **0.667(0.061)** | **0.768(0.124)** | **0.640(0.039)** | **0.684(0.035)** | **0.699** |\n\nFrom the results, it's clear that the \"naive\" combination approach at the prediction level yielded unsatisfactory results. The main reason behind this suboptimal performance is that this method focuses solely on single-modal learning, failing to extract relevant common information between modalities. This further underscores the superiority of our approach, which, through information disentanglement, eliminates redundancy between inter-models and effectively captures both specific and common information.\n\n---\n> **Q2) Kaplan-Meier analysis. Please state how cut-offs were selected in the manuscript.**\n> \n\nThank you for your suggestion.  We have provided more details about the Kaplan-Meier analysis in our manuscript. In our work, we employed a five-fold cross-validation evaluation, getting one model for every data fold. For every validation set, we determined the cut-offs by taking the median of the model-predicted risk values. Patients with a risk higher than the median are assigned as high risk, and patients with a risk lower than the median as low risk. In addition, in response to the suggestion from reviewer G86X, we have also reported the median survival months for each risk group on **Page 8**. \n\n---\n> **Q3) The hyperparameter choices. How hyperparameters were selected with the dataset. As cross-validation is used to generate the evaluation results, to what extent were the hyperparameters selected using the evaluation datasets and is there risk of selection bias as a result?**\n> \n\nThank you for bringing up this important point.  Due to the limited size of datasets, like many other methods, we chose cross-validation as the assessment approach, allowing us to effectively leverage the available data and enhance the reliability of our evaluation.\n\nIn our study, we adopted a careful approach to address the potential risk of selection bias in hyperparameter choices. To begin with, we defined the hyperparameter search space based on the commonly used ranges in information bottleneck methods like VIB[1] and MIB[2]. During the selection process, we implemented a grid search strategy. For each hyperparameter, while keeping others fixed, we conducted a five-fold cross-validation, selecting the hyperparameter that exhibited the best average performance across all validation sets. Furthermore, to further mitigate selection bias, these hyperparameters were selected on multiple datasets, ensuring the generalizability of the chosen configuration. By employing this approach, we aimed to minimize the risk of selection bias. \n\nwe have incorporated the introductions on this aspect into **Appendix C.2 on Page 19**. \n\n**REFERENCES**\n\n[1]  Alemi, Alexander A., et al. \"Deep Variational Information Bottleneck.\"\u00a0*International Conference on Learning Representations*. 2016.\n\n[2] Federici, Marco, et al. \"Learning Robust Representations via Multi-View Information Bottleneck.\"\u00a0*8th International Conference on Learning Representations*.
