The main idea is based on smoothing the distribution\nby adding Gaussian noise to the original sample. The process then repeats $m$ times,\neach time independently adding gaussian noise to the original sample.\nThe final step involves computing the Bayes optimal predictor of the original sample based on the i.i.d. samples from the smoothed density.\n\nThe authors first demonstrate via an example that sampling all the smoothed observations jointly at once might not be optimal, since the \nsampling problem might become ill-conditioned as $m$ increases, which prohibits the use of standard MCMC methods. Subsequently, they demonstrate\nthat if instead sequential sampling is used, where each sample is taken conditional on the previous samples, then the condition number\nof the sampling problem can only improve as $m$ increases, enabling the use of MCMC methods. They prove that this process succeeds to sample\nin a general setting where the initial distribution is supported on a bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Additionally, they evaluate their\napproach experimentally, by sampling from elliptical gaussians (which are ill-conditioned) and mixtures of gaussians. \nThe performance is then compared to that of standard Langevin MCMC algorithms without smoothing, showing significant benefits both\nin terms of distributional convergence, as well as finding less dominant modes of the distribution."

The idea of smoothing \nand walk-jump sampling has already appeared in prior work (Saremi & Hyvarinen, 2019), but this is the first time it has been applied to\nthe general problem of sampling from non-log concave densities. I like the intuition given by the authors about how smoothing helps by \"filling in\"\nprobability mass between modes of the original distribution, thus reducing the general problem to the log-concave setting.\nOne strength of this new approach is that the sequential sampling can simply be implemented by keeping a running average of all the previous\nsamples up until this point, so the memory footprint is small. \nMoreover, this paper is written with great clarity, as all theoretical results are explained in detail and they convincingly demonstrate the power of the new approach.\nThe experiments also complement the theory very nicely, by showing the benefit of running Langevin with smoothing. The tunneling phenomena that\nare observed from the simulations are also very interesting. Lastly, most of the proofs follow from standard techniques, but they are at an\nadequate level for ICLR."

The authors acknowledge that this is \na separate issue that needs to be addressed. I understand this might be beyond the scope of the current work, which is more focused on \nshowing the benefits of smoothing. However, ultimately estimating the score function is a crucial step for this to be an end-to-end approach\nfor sampling and it is not clear what is the difficulty of this problem compared to the original sampling problem (is it strictly easier in some sense?).\nIn my opinion, this would make clear what the benefit of this approach over standard MCMC algorithms is."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "-Related to a previous point about estimating the score function, how exactly do the authors arrive at the expression (4.8) for estimating the\nscore function? In appendix B, a number of properties is proven about the score function, among which that it is related to $\\mathbb{E}[X|y_{1:m}]$.\nHowever, I don't see how this is captured in the empirical definition of (4.8). What is the meaning of taking a weighted average of\nthe $\\epsilon_i$s?\n\n-As the authors discuss in Remark 2, the convergence of the condition number to $1$ with rate $1/m$ holds as long as the original distribution involves \nsome (even small) additive gaussian noise. Why is it enough that even a tiny bit of Gaussian noise be added to the distribution for this decay to happen?\nDo the authors have some intuition about that statement?\n\n-Related to the previous question, if we care about the expected hessian of the conditional sampling, I'm wondering whether it's possible to have a version of Theorem 1 showing that the expected condition number of the conditional sampling problem\nconverges to $1$ with rate $1/m$ without assuming that the original distribution contains some amount of Gaussian noise. The reason is\nthe following: the proof for all the claims about the \"increase\" in log-concavity basically hinge on equation (D.2), which asserts that\n$\\nabla^2 \\log p(y_{1:m}) = -\\sigma^{-2} I + \\sigma^{-4} Cov(X|y_{1:m})$. The argument then proceeds by the observation that conditioning on more and\nmore observations can only reduce the variance of $X$ in expectation, so the \"positive\" part on the right hand side can only become smaller as\n$m$ increases. The proof of Theorem 1 expresses $Cov(X|y_{1:m})$ as $O(1/ m) + O(1/m^2) Cov(Z|y_{1:m})$ \nand bounds the latter covariance by a constant, since $Z$ is supported on a bounded set (as the footnote in page 18 suggests). \nHowever, it seems conceivable to me that if we do not impose the assumption s $X = Z + N_0$, we could instead\nshow directly that $\\mathbb{E}[Cov(X|y_{1:m})]$ decreases as $O(1/m)$ if $X$ is bounded. The reason I believe this is true is that, by Proposition 2, we know that the posterior\nof $X$ conditioned on $y_{1:m}$ converges in distribution to $X$ at a rate of $1/m$. Thus, the conditional variance of $X$ given $y_{1:m}$ \nshould decrease as $m$ becomes larger. Another intuitive way to see this is that we could for example simply take the average \n$\\overline{y_m}$, which is $O(\\sigma/m)$ close to $X$. Thus, we gain more and more information about $X$ as $m$ increases, which suggests\nthat $\\mathbb{E}[Cov(X|y_{1:m})] = O(1/m)$ always. Have the authors considered this more general statement?"

We have also added more experiments to Appendix I using Langevin MCMC for estimating the smoothed score functions.  The question the reviewer has raised on the difficulty of estimating $g(y ; \\sigma)$ is very important (we had a brief discussion of it in Sec. 6) and theoretical analysis for this aspect of our algorithm is a great research direction.\n\nRegarding **Questions**:\n\n- We added a new section to the appendix, Appendix F: Estimators for $\\nabla \\log p(y)$, giving the derivations for the estimators (F.1) (the same as (4.8) in our original submission) and (F.2) for the Langevin MCMC estimator. In that section, we also give the algorithm (Algorithm 3) for estimating $g(y; \\sigma)$ using (overdamped) Langevin MCMC.\n\n- This is a great observation. Our main intuition here is that for any degree of smoothing sampling should become easier upon accumulation of noisy measurements since we're gathering more \"evidence\" on the clean sample, but this is too crude of an intuition perhaps. This observation by the reviewer is very interesting and perhaps there are some deeper results here related to the point below.\n\n- We did consider strengthening the theorem along the lines of the reviewer's comments, in particular whether $1/m$ rate still holds when $\\tau=0$. Please note that in Theorem 1 (as opposed to Lemma 2) we are interested in the conditional Hessian itself, not the expected conditional Hessian. The main challenge here is that Theorem 1 is currently too restrictive (almost surely) and we think a great future direction is to see under what conditions the $1/m$ rate holds with *high probability*. This discussion is also related to our Remark 3 in the paper on the hardness of strenghtening  Theorem 1 regarding the monotonicity (4.7). We appreciate the reviewer sharing their thoughts on this aspect of the problem: although the analysis of the expectation of the Hessian is interesting in its own terms, it cannot be directly used to provide some guarantees on progressively more log-concave sampling."

The authors have done an excellent job of demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and its potential applications. \n\nThe problem itself is also fundamental and worth studying. The authors start by finding that \"all (measurements) at once\" (AAO) is suboptimal and then present a \"one (measurements) at once\" (OAT) algorithm that has solid theoretical guarantees. In particular, Gaussian smoothing helps transform a (nearly) compact density towards log-concavity so that it's feasible to sample from it, and measurements accumulation (in a non-Markovian manner) makes the density more and more log-concave and well-conditioned. Combining both effects makes the proposed OAT strategy superior to AAO ones.\n\nMoreover, the paper demonstrates the value of combining theory and experiments in a research project. The theoretical analysis provides a solid foundation, while the experiments validate the proposed method and help readers gain more insights and understand its accuracy. Combining theory and experiments leads to a more complete understanding of the OAT strategies and opens up new avenues for further research."

I understand the inner-loop method is the object of study here. Still, it should be feasible to make some assumptions around its properties and derive a theorem that captures the algorithm's performance as $m$ and $n_t$ increase. The error metric could ideally be a Wasserstain-type distance for consistency with the experiment section. \n\nThe experiment evaluation partially supports and reflects the theoretical claims, but the settings could be more complex for a thorough evaluation. For example, it would be interesting to understand what magnitude the # sampling iterations must be for some rather complex distributions, e.g., $k$-mixture of Gaussians where $k$ increases. The densities used in Section 5 are well-designed to test specific hypotheses/claims. Yet, experiments should probably cover more than that, such as demonstrating the properties of the main algorithm(s), which can be critical for method adoption.\n\nMinor points: \n- May I know the purpose of \"4.1 Example\" as it seems to be just deriving various quantities for a concrete/standard Gaussian mixture? I don't see how it helps the readers better understand Theorem 1.\n- In Section 5.2, is there an intuitive explanation for why \"the optimal $\\sigma$ here is in fact larger than the noise level needed to make $p(y_1)$ log-concave\"?\n- Would it make sense to add more description for Figure 4, panels (c) and (d)?

We hope the reviewer reconsider this as a weakness if it has affected their score. The paper is already dense with theoretical results and we had limited space for supporting the theoretical formalism with experiments on demonstrating the effectiveness of smoothing and the log-concave sampling strategy which the reviewer has kindly highlighted.\n\n- The experiment on $k$-mixture of Gaussians as $k$ and $d$ increase is very interesting, but requires careful considerations in experimental design... We are currently working on extending our work to the Ising model on the Boolean hypercube {$-1,1$}$^d$, where, after smoothing, one can effectively think of as $k$-mixture of Gaussians with $k=2^d$ mixtures.\n\nRegarding minor points:\n\n- Thank you for highlighting this. The proof of Theorem 1 is somewhat involved and we found it useful to give an example where the reader can easily follow all the derivations. We also like Example 4.1 since it points to some stronger theoretical results than what we could prove in this paper, e.g., the upper bound in Theorem 1 becomes tight in the example we considered.\n\n- Our intuitive explanation is that larger $\\sigma$ leads to better condition numbers which seems to help beyond the log-concavity threshold. This is however dependent on the MCMC$_\\sigma$ used in Algorithm 1.\n\n- We have added more descriptions to the caption for Figure 4, panels (c) and (d), which illustrates that the OAT scheme samples the subdominant mode well, whereas very few samples reach this mode when $\\sigma=0$. \n\nRegarding **Questions**: We have shared the code for this submission [at this anonymous link](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/solaris-1FC4) and will publicly release the code upon acceptance of the paper."

We are delighted to see that you enjoyed our paper. \n\nWe appreciate the time you took on the literature on empirical Bayes and walk-jump sampling. We will take the reviewer's comment into consideration in follow-up work.\n\nRegarding **Questions**:\n\n1. We are not sure if the reviewer is referring to discrete distributions here. We are currenly working on extending our work to sampling from the Ising model where the random variable takes values in the Boolean hypercube \\{$-1,1$\\}$^d$. In our formalism, after smoothing sampling becomes equivalent to sampling from a (smoothed) k-mixture of Gaussians with $k=2^d$ mixtures.\n\n2. Not adversarial per se, but we have included experiments in the paper that point to the limitations of the framework, mainly regarding the problem of score estimation. In short, the performance of the algorithm suffers if we the estimator of $g(y; \\sigma)$ (used in Algorithm 2, in turn in Algorithm 1) is poor. This was briefly discussed in the original submission in Sec. 6. Please also see Appendix F and I in the updated manuscript."

The structure is well-organized: the authors first introduce an example of an anisotropic Gaussian target distribution, which leads to the important observation that OAT is easier than AAO in terms of the condition number. Then, they present the theory for general distributions (once log-concave, always log-concave), which helps the reader understand the motivation."

                    "value": "Score estimation is essential for the algorithm's efficiency. However, most of the experiments in the paper use the analytic score function, which is not realistic in practice. Moreover, the score has to be estimated at each step of ${\\rm MCMC}_\\sigma$, which will significantly increase the algorithm's complexity.\n\nThe paper only compares the performance of accurate and approximate scores in appendix H, and the result is not very satisfactory. The estimated score performs well when $d=2$, but it deteriorates when $d=8$. These results suggest that the score estimate's precision could be much worse in high dimensions, which I believe is the paper's main weakness.\n\nIn 4.2.1, the proposed method for score estimation is based on importance sampling (which transforms the expectation w.r.t. the probability density $\\nu\\propto\\exp(-f-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}||\\cdot-y||^2)$ to $\\mu=\\mathcal{N}(y,\\sigma^2I)$). However, (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018) has shown that the sample size needed for accurate estimation by importance sampling is usually $\\exp({\\rm KL}(\\nu||\\mu))$ for general target functions. For this reason, (Huang et al, 2023, section 3) use Langevin Monte Carlo to sample from $\\nu$ and combine it with importance sampling in a similar task of score estimation. The experiments in your paper indicate that the score estimator also suffers from high variance. The authors should experiment with different score estimators, instead of saying that \"studying the covariance of the plug-in estimator and devising better estimators is beyond the scope of this paper\".\n\nReferences:\n\n(Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018) Sourav Chatterjee, Persi Diaconis.

The algorithm outputs a *biased* sample of $p_X$, but the bias $W_2^2(p_X,\\hat{p}_{m^{-1/2}\\sigma})$ can be made arbitrarily small by choosing $\\sigma$ and $m$ such that $\\frac{\\sigma^2d}{m}$ is small enough. How can we choose these parameters in a principled way? In the Gaussian example (proposition 4), we can reduce $\\kappa_1$ by increasing $\\sigma$, and in theorem 1, we need a large $\\sigma$ to make $p(y_1)$ strongly log-concave. However, this also increases the bias, so we need a larger $m$ to compensate that. How can we balance this trade-off between complexity and accuracy?\n\n2. In the experiment, how do you choose the projection direction $\\theta$ for estimating the Wasserstein-2 distance? A more fair comparison would be to use $\\theta$ following the uniform distribution on the Euclidean unit ball (i.e., the *sliced* Wasserstein-2 distance). Efficient approximation algorithms are available, for example, in (Nadjahi et al., 2021).\n\nMinor corrections:\n\n1.

Following the submission of the paper we did conduct experiments where we used Langevin MCMC for estimating the smoothed score functions. We modified Sec. 4.2.1 and added a new section to the appendix (Appendix F in the revised manuscript). We have also updated the results in Appendix I with the new experiments.\n\nThank you for pointing out the reference (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018). This problem is also related to the literature on \"Entropy SGD\", e.g., (Chaudhari et al., 2017), where the estimating smoothed score functions (although it's not framed like that) is used in the context of optimizing neural network parameters. (Chatterjee and Diaconis, 2018) and (Chaudhari et al., 2017) are now cited -- please see Appendix F. (Huang et al, 2023) is a concurrent work, which we were not aware of. We would be happy to cite it in the camera-ready after a careful reading of the paper.\n\n\nWe consider the new experiments added to the appendix (Fig. 7) on running Algorithm 1 using score estimation with Langevin MCMC as preliminary as we did not conduct exhaustive tuning of the underdamped Langevin MCMC used for the score estimation experiments. \n\nRegarding **Questions**:\n\n1. The reviewer is correct in pointing out the fundamental trade-off in our formalism: larger $\\sigma$ makes sampling easier but then we require more measurements to get close to the target distribution. We currently do not have a bound on convergence of our algorithm taking everything into consideration. Another layer of complexity is the computational complexity of estimating $g(y; \\sigma)$. This is discussed around two main limitations of our work in Sec. 6. This is an important future direction for further understanding the formalism we have developed in this work.\n\n2. We agree with the reviewer that sliced 2-Wasserstein distance with random projections is more suitable than the 1D marginal 2-Wasserstein distance reported in the paper (for elliptical Gaussian we used the \"difficult\" direction). In the revised manuscript uploaded here, the metric is updated to the sliced 2-Wasserstein distance. We did not use the efficient approximation framework by Nadjahi et al. 2021, but implemented the 2-Wasserstein distance using 1000 random projections (Eq. 9 in the reference).\n\nThank you for your minor corrections! They have been incorporated in the manuscript. \n\n----\nPratik Chaudhari, Anna Choromanska, Stefano Soatto, Yann LeCun, Carlo Baldassi, Christian Borgs, Jennifer Chayes, Levent Sagun, and Riccardo Zecchina.

                        "value": "Dear authors,\n\nI sincerely appreciate your efforts in addressing my concerns and updating the paper. The connection between score estimation and entropy SGD is indeed an intriguing aspect, and I acknowledge its importance for future research.\n\nIn the revised Appendix I, the inclusion of the Langevin estimator of the score alongside the comparison with the importance sampling estimator is valuable. However, once again, neither of the methods attains a performance comparable to the analytic score, especially in high dimension ($d=8$). In my view, this limitation represents a significant drawback of the proposed framework and similar methods such as the reverse diffusion Monte Carlo (Huang et al., 2023) which requires efficient score estimation of a Gaussian-convoluted density without incorporating learning components.\n\nDespite my genuine appreciation for the novelty of the framework and the overall quality of the paper, the observed limitations in practical performance leave me unconvinced regarding the algorithm's efficiency. Regrettably, I find myself unable to assign a higher score to this paper. I believe that addressing the challenges associated with score estimation could significantly enhance the practical applicability of your framework."
