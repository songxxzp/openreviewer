A formal definition should for example define that the class sets between the feature extractor's training set and the set being clustered as disjoint; this is important to avoid problems like the unfairness of comparing CLIP embeddings on equal grounds.\n\nWe agree that the omission of a clear definition of \u201czero-shot clustering\u201d is unfortunate and we will make sure that this will be included in a future version. \n\n> On a related/followup note: Including comparisons against CLIP on the same grounds is unfair to other feature extractors and detracts from the \"zero-shot\" nature of the task.

The current discussion is hindered by comparing against CLIP directly as readers are not able to properly judge the quality of the feature extractor's generalization.\n\nThis is a fair point. We are currently aiming to include results using the OpenCLIP model, for which we know what data the model was trained on, and therefore can better interpret the results and how they fit within the \u201czero-shot\u201d scenario.\n\n> The hyper parameter sweep (second stage) considers parameters only for Agglomerative Clustering (AC), with only HDBSCAN also getting any parameter evaluation (albeit for a single parameter choice). K-means could have it's distance metric changed as well as have an alternative formulation with automatic K (elbow method or even using silhouette score itself). Affinity Propagation also has hyper parameters that could be candidate for a sweep. The lack of experimentation with the other clustering methods raises concerns regarding the final results as AC ends up being the recommended method.\n\nOur preliminary analysis showed that tuning the HDBSCAN metric distance did not have a notable impact on performance, hence we prioritized tuning AC over HDBSCAN. After the submission, for completeness-sake we extended our full hyperparameter sweep over the hyperparameters of Affinity Propagation and HDBSCAN, and confirmed that their final performance was not notably affected by this further optimization.\n\n> Other notes: [...]\n\nWe will make sure to address all the mentioned points. Regarding the reference to Vaze et al. in Sec 4.1 we will make sure to include the insight, which is: datapoint clusters are more well defined with a DINO ViT backbone than DINO ResNet backbone\n\n> Excluding CLIP, what would the authors recommend between using CNN or Transformer-based architectures? It is important to consider that a ViT-B is not computationally comparable to a ResNet50 (which is lighter by 3~4x in FLOPs and parameters).\n\nBased on our findings we would recommend using contrastive-learning based approaches, given that both MoCo and CLIP are contrastive-based methods. We do also find that there isn\u2019t a single specific method that is good for both backbone types. Surprisingly, we also find that the supervised encoders are in general very good for clustering, which was not originally expected. These results indicate that there is no single best method at the moment, and that our understanding of SSL methods is not fully complete.\n\nWith regards to CNN vs Transformer, our experimental paradigm was not set up to investigate this. As the reviewer points out, a ViT-B requires notably more compute than ResNet50. Our choice of architectures was driven by which pretrained models were readily available in accompaniment to prominent SSL papers. Our results indicate that ViT-B performs better than ResNet-50 when the new dataset is in-domain or a similar domain to the training data, but there is little difference between them for out-of-domain datasets. However as we only investigated two backbones, we do not have sufficient evidence to make any strong conclusions on this point."

For a lot of the dataset tested, it heavily overlap with ImageNet images or CLIP training images. I think it is ok to say \"the work benchmarked a lot of datasets\" but it is not accurate to say \"the work benchmarked a lot of out-of-distribution datasets\"\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that not all of the datasets are necessarily out-of-distribution, as there is partial overlap between the domains Therefore we will reformulate our analysis and instead consider three kinds of dataset groups:\n- In distribution: ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-V2 (new), CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100\n- Fine-grained: Flowers102, FGVC aircraft, NABirds, iNaturalist\n- OOD: ImageNet-R (new), MNIST, fMNIST, SVHN\n\n> The metric used. There has been a long-standing image clustering and deep image clustering community (e.g.https://github.com/zhoushengisnoob/DeepClustering) that measures the accuracy of clustering directly. This has became the most important metric to measure clustering performance.\n\nWe politely disagree that \u201caccuracy\u201d is the most important metric for clustering performance. While it may have become more commonly used, classic metrics such as Adjusted Mutual Information are still widely used and of great value. We also want to highlight that in the recent survey [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07579)] (a paper highlighted on the GitHub page linked to us by the reviewer), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), and Accuracy are mentioned as the most common metrics. NMI is an arguably worse version of AMI as it does not correct for random chance agreement levels which vary with the number of clusters used, and therefore it makes sense to instead use AMI.ARI is highly redundant with AMI, hence we did not include it in the paper despite computing it in the analysis. Moreover, accuracy requires a 1-to-1 mapping via the Hungarian algorithm, which is not possible when the clusterer is allowed to determine the number of clusters in its output.\n\n> Is this work truly the first investigation into zero-shot clustering of SSL feature?: Since 2020, there has been lots of work focusing on image-clustering based on a pretrained (SSL) image encoder. The papers have shown that (1) zero-shot clustering can have non-trivial performance (similar to the result of this paper) (2) Performance can be further improved with different finetuning methods. I think it is important to acknowledge the previous works and reconsider the novelty of this work.\n\nWhile there have been prior methods that combine SSL-features with classical clustering, such as [[2](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Ronen_DeepDPM_Deep_Clustering_With_an_Unknown_Number_of_Clusters_CVPR_2022_paper.html)], these methods have optimised the latent space for clustering first, resulting in the procedure not being zero-shot. We would greatly appreciate any references to the reviewer\u2019s two claims and will accordingly change our manuscript.\n\n> Some issues with definition and terminology: CLIP is not self-supervised, it is rather supervised/language-supervised/weakly-supervised. MoCo/DINO/VICReg have a lot in common. Last year's ICLR best paper candidate has shown a strong duality between the methods, so it would be more accurate to just say they are contrastive\n\nWe agree that CLIP can be categorised as weakly supervised learning. However, as the model is learnt with a contrastive learning loss-function, we also argue that it is fair to categorise it as \u201ccross-domain contrastive learning\u201d and thereby as self-supervised learning.\n\nWe would also argue that MoCo, DINO, and VICReg are not all contrastive methods, as their loss function is not contrastive. As per [[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210] we define DINO and VICReg as self-distillation and canonical correlation analysis approaches, respectively. While [[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02574)] (which we assume is the paper the reviewer is referring to) argue that VICReg and SimCLR can be made equivalent, the paper also directly states that other methods such as DINO, MoCo, and SimSiam do not perfectly fit this framework. \n\n> Writing and Presentation: I think the work can be improved a lot, with the current format.\n\nWe are sorry to hear that the presentation was not satisfactory. We are more than happy to improve the writing and presentation of any part if the reviewer is willing to point these out to us.\n\n[1] A Comprehensive Survey on Deep Clustering: Taxonomy, Challenges, and Future Directions - Zhou et al. arXiv, 2022\n\n[2] DeepDPM: Deep Clustering With an Unknown Number of Clusters - Ronen et al.

While the results are useful to use as a reference to pick the best models + clustering methods for a particular task, I fail to see any impactful research contributions. The analysis of correlation between AMI and Silhouette score is useful, but again not strong enough to warrant acceptance\n\nWe thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to highlight our finding that raw SSL features are not necessarily more clusterable than those from a supervised network is a novel insight, and worth diving deeper into in future research. This challenges the idea that SSL features should be more general than supervised features. We also want to clarify that we do not recommend any specific combination of encoder and clustering method. We instead recommend using a single clustering method\u2014agglomerative clustering\u2014for all tasks. \n\n> The results in Figure 1 and 2, especially Figure 1, have very wide error bars, meaning that the comparisons wouldn't be statistically significant. This is probably because of the use of the rank metric -- it would be better to see an aggregated performance metric which isn't as sensitive (like an average), resulting in some statistically significant results\n\nA rank test has fewer priors than a *t*-test and we don't think there is a reason to strongly assume that the delta in the accuracy between two approaches on different datasets would have a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, we are of the opinion that our current approach is better principled, but we would indeed probably get more statistical power by assuming the distance was comparable across datasets.\n\n\n> Minor: In the Introduction, the paper mentions \"while the embeddings from an SSL-trained feature extractor can perform well on downstream tasks after fine-tuning the network, there has been little investigation into the utility of the embeddings without fine-tuning the network\" -- this is inaccurate, SSL methods have been extensively evaluated without finetuning via k-nearest neighbours and linear probing while keeping the encoder frozen (e.g. MoCov3, DINO).\n\nWe agree with the reviewers comment, and will correct the text to emphasise that the uniqueness to our approach comes not from the fact that there is no fine-tuning of the network, but that there is no training on labelled data from the new domain at all, and that the closest evaluation method would be kNN probing.\n\n\n> Minor: the paper considers CLIP as a self-supervised method, whereas it is typically considered a weakly supervised method since the texts provide noisy supervision.\n\nWe agree that CLIP can be categorised as weakly supervised learning. However, as the model is learnt with a contrastive learning loss-function, we also argue that it is fair to categorise it as \u201ccross-domain contrastive learning\u201d and thereby as self-supervised learning.\n\n> It would be interesting to see a connection between clustering scores and traditional SSL evaluations like k-NN, linear probes, or finetuned results -- do these move together in unison or are the clustering capabilities of a model's representations relatively unrelated to other evaluations?\n\nThis would be an interesting analysis that we hope to integrate in a future version of the manuscript.\n\n> As of now, it seems like a study of clustering methods on SSL encoders. A study can also have interesting research observations / contributions but currently the paper seems like a simple description of the observations without any further analyses\n\nThese are all good questions. While we may provide some insights into why e.g. agglomerative clustering performs well by going deeper into a set of predictions, we will in general be hard-pressed to provide any guarantees. However, we would also argue that these exploratory studies are important as they highlight a hole in our general understanding of commonly used methods (in this case SSL pretraining), even if we cannot provide all the answers for why this is."
