The authors first demonstrate the drawback of existing dataset condensation methods in this area and analyze the inefficiency of a naive solution that involves solving nested optimization. Then, through theoretical analysis, they propose a hyperparameter-calibrated dataset condensation method. The basic idea is to learn a synthetic validation dataset such that hypergradients on hyperparameters can be matched. They also apply effective approximation to further reduce the complexity so that the final algorithm is a first-order one. Experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both image and graph datasets."

To better demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed method, experiments on larger datasets like ImageNet, at least subsets of ImageNet or TinyImageNet, are encouraged.\n2. Limited Analysis. The authors only focus on the performance on several datasets. The analysis on the algorithm itself is insufficient. Specifically, how does the algorithm compare to the naive solution in Eq. 3 in terms of both performance and efficiency. The authors may consider using a toy dataset for this analysis. After all, the proposed method is an efficient approximation of directly using original datasets. Where the approximation comes from and how much it is are important in a scientific view.\n3. I am curious about the details of the method to deal with discrete hyperparameters. The descriptions in Sec. 5.2 and Appendix H are confusing to me. An algorithmic flow is encouraged for better presentation. In addition, are other approaches like Gumbel Softmax applicable?\n4. Eq. IFT is an efficient approximation of the hypergradients. It would be better to make this clear in the description. And \"=\" should not be used in Eq. IFT.\n5. Minor: some confusing expersions:\n   * \"this limitation\" in the second paragraph of Introduction: the contents in the previous paragraph is not actually a limitation. And this sentence is incoherent to the last sentence of the previous paragraph.\n   * The last two lines in Page 5.\n   * Page 6: \"For generating $S^{train}$, We ...\", \"W\" here should be lowercase."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviews provided by reviewer 4Foe. We are gratified by the recognition of the paper's key strengths. In particular, we are pleased that reviewer 4Foe acknowledges the innovation of our hyperparameter gradient matching method, the solidness of our theoretical analysis, the clarity in explaining research issues, and the impressive results achieved with image and graph datasets.\n\nBelow, we will address all questions and concerns raised by reviewer 4Foe, which primarily stem from misunderstandings.\n\n\n> **Weakness 1:** The paper does not explain some concepts mentioned for the first time, such as \"supernet\".\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:** Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the accessibility of our paper. In the main manuscript, we deliberately chose not to delve into the concept of 'supernet' to avoid potential confusion, considering it is not central to the paper's primary message. We did mention it briefly in the conclusion section. The term 'supernet' is referenced twice in the appendices: once in Appendix D and again in Appendix G. We acknowledge that a comprehensive explanation and citation for 'supernet' were provided only in Appendix G. Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have now updated the manuscript to not mention the term 'supernet' in the main paper, to ensure consistency and clarity.\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 2:** Lack of some ablation experiments, such as the performance of searching directly by compressing the test set using the dataset distillation method.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:** Regarding Weakness 2, there seems to be a misconception. \n\n- Tables 1 and 2 in our paper actually present the experiments the reviewer is referring to. As our work is the **first** in integrating hyperparameter calibration with dataset condensation, our comparison is with the current methods that directly compress the validation set. (We infer the reviewer's mention of the 'test set' to be a reference to the 'validation set,' since the test set is not typically accessible during training and hyperparameter tuning.)\n\n- The results in Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate HCDC's remarkable ability to preserve performance across varying hyperparameters. This underscores HCDC's efficacy in condensing the dataset to speedup the hyperparameter search process.\n \n---\n\n> **Weakness 3:** As a dataset distillation method, there is a lack of comparison with other dataset distillation methods in terms of compression rate and generalization performance.\n\n**Response to Weakness 3:** There appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the goal of the paper, the novelty and comparison scope of our method.\n\n- Our approach is the first of its kind focusing on data condensation specifically for hyperparameter search, filling a gap in existing methodologies.\n\n- We have conducted comparative analyses with other data distillation techniques, as showcased in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 focuses on image data, where we standardized the compression to 50 images per class for all baselines. This was to maintain consistency, as varying the compression rate was not the primary focus of our image data experiments. In contrast, Table 2, which centers on graph data, includes comparisons with state-of-the-art graph compressing methods under different compression rates ($c_{train}/n$).\n\n\n- It is essential to highlight that our objective extends beyond simple data compression. **The primary aim is to leverage data condensation to speedup hyperparameter search, which is often the most resource/computation-intensive aspect of machine learning model development.** Once we have successfully identified the hyperparameters, it's not necessary to train the final model on condensed data. We can instead train the model on the full dataset using the identified hyperparameters."

                        "value": "We express our sincere gratitude to reviewer UefQ for their insightful review and constructive feedback. We are particularly encouraged by reviewer UefQ's recognition of the novelty of our approach to dataset condensation for architecture and hyperparameter search, its effectiveness in addressing significant challenges within the field, the compelling rationale behind our primary objective, and the impressive performance demonstrated by our proposed method across various datasets.\n\n\nReviewer UefQ's primary concern centers on the lack of a comprehensive analysis of the time complexity of our proposed method. We emphasize that this **one-time cost** grants significant computation and time savings for **repeated hyperparameter search cost**.\n\nConsidering all the other merits of the paper, we sincerely hope that Reviewer UefQ could consider adjusting their score after our more detailed clarification below.\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 1:** The process of condensing synthetic validation appears intricate and time-intensive. However, the paper lacks a comprehensive analysis of this procedure.\nCould you provide information on the time required to optimize the dataset using the HCDC algorithm in experiments, including Table 3?\n\n**Response to Weakness 1:** \n\n- First, the primary motivation behind our Hyperparameter-Calibrated Dataset Condensation (HCDC) approach is to expedite the hyperparameter search process when dealing with extensive validation datasets. While the condensation process introduces an overhead, the subsequent hyperparameter search on the condensed dataset is considerably faster. **Our empirical evaluations (*Table 3*) demonstrate that the overall time savings achieved by our method outweigh the initial condensation overhead**, making it a viable alternative to traditional hyperparameter search on the original dataset.\n\n- It's important to note that the dataset condensation process is a one-time cost. Once we have the condensed dataset, it serves as a tool to significantly expedite numerous hyperparameter/architecture search algorithms. Our HCDC considerably expedite the two NAS baselines (DARTS-PT and REINFORCE) as shown in **Table 3**. \n\n- The HCDC condensation process requires a one-time investment of approximately 127.9 minutes. Although this duration seems substantial, the time savings in subsequent architecture searches are considerable. Specifically, the search time for DARTS-PT is reduced from 229 seconds to 35.5 seconds and for REINFORCE from 1492 seconds to 119 seconds, as detailed in Table 3. This significant relative reduction in search times justifies the initial longer condensation period, as it provides substantial efficiencies for any future searches conducted on the condensed dataset.\n\n- Regarding the time complexity of HCDC condensation (Algorithm 1), we have conducted a theoretical complexity analysis presented in Appendix I. In summary, while the conventional gradient-matching-based dataset condensation has a per iteration time complexity of $O(P)$, where $P$ is the number of model parameters, the complexity of HCDC is $O(P+H)$, with $H$ being the number of hyperparameters. Owing to the efficient inverse Hessian approximation, the linear complexity concerning both parameters and hyperparameters is maintained. As evidence, our \"Finding the best convolution filter on graphs\" experiment demonstrated that, with a few introduced hyperparameters, the HCDC runtime on the ogbn-arxiv graph dataset (with a condensation ratio $c_{train}/n$ of 0.5%) was 805s, compared to the standard condensation's 494s. We intend to include more empirical runtime data for HCDC in the revised manuscript, as you suggested.\n\n---\n\n> **Weakness 2:** Figure 4 doesn't offer a fair comparison of the architecture search. To achieve this, the graph should be revised to include the optimization time for the HCDC algorithm.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2: **\n- As mentioned in the previous response, the one-time running time needed for HCDC is around 127.9 minutes. It's important to note that the dataset condensation process is a one-time cost. Once we have the condensed dataset, it serves as a tool to significantly expedite numerous hyperparameter/architecture search algorithms."
