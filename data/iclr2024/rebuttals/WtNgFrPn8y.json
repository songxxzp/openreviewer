                    "value": "In this paper, the authors study a constrained optimization problem for ads campaign that maximizes the value received by a campaign subject to ROI and budget constraints. The authors first show that in an offline setting no approximation within any positive factor is possible. They then move onto an online setting where the expected number of clicks generated by a bid and expected cost given a bid becomes unknown, and propose algorithms to resolve the learning problem. In particular, the GCB algorithm guarantees sublinear regret at the cost of a linear number of constraint violations, while GCBsafe ensures constant upper bound on number of violations and a linear regret. They also show that if one is to solve a relaxed version of the constrained optimization problem, both sublinear regret and sublinear number of constraint violations is achievable. Finally, they evaluated their algorithms via numerical studies."

                    "value": "- Regarding the constrained optimization problem considered in this paper, I wonder if the authors can provide more motivations for the forms of n_j(x) and c_j(x). Specifically, in real-world advertising these are usually determined by the mechanism of the ad auctions. Could you provide more justification for the current formulation?\n- Another major concern I had is about how the authors measure the performance of the algorithm. In particular, the authors consider the number of constraint violations, but to me, a more natural and reasonable metric would be the **amount** of constraint violations for each of the campaigns. Having all of the constraints violated but only by a small amount can be better than having some of the constraints violated by a tremendous amount. I wonder if the authors have theoretical results that characterize the amount of constraint violations here. \n- In Theorem 8, the authors proposed an algorithm that achieves both sublinear regret and sublinear number of constraint violations. However, as the authors discussed, the parameters $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ can be really large in practice. It is also unlikely that one can let the budget spent go to infinity in practice. When $\\phi$ and $\\psi$ become really large, the constraints essentially become meaningless. I wonder if the authors can provide more discussions for this and/or have evaluated this numerically.\n- Could you also justify the formulas of n_j(x) and c_j(x) used in the numerical studies? I also wonder if the algorithms have been evaluated on real-world data. \n- The related work section is not included in the paper."

The general objective is to optimize revenue while adhering to a minimum Return On Investment (ROI) level. This paper focuses on the intricacies of this multifaceted problem, which can be naturally captured by a combinatorial optimization problem subject to ROI and budget constraints.\nThe above problem is further complicated by the presence of uncertainty in the parameters of these constraints. The algorithms employed for bid allocation and strategy optimization must tackle this uncertainty, and their exploration choices can inadvertently lead to constraint violations, which act as substantial roadblocks to the effective implementation of online marketing strategies in practical, real-world scenarios.\nTo address these challenges, this paper conducts a comprehensive study, researching both the optimization and learning aspects of the problem. Notably, to provide practical solutions, the paper introduces novel algorithms such as GCB, GCB_safe etc., each tailored to balance regret and safety. Empirical experiments provide insights into the comparative performance of these algorithms."

Can ROI be tackled in a different way, for example, adding a penalty factor related to ROI into the objective to be optimized? Why the way that ROI is handled in this paper is the best? \n2.\tAlthough the GCB_safe algorithm is designed not to violate ROI and budget constraints, the paper may not fully demonstrate the performance of the algorithm under variable or extreme conditions.

Each option results in a pair of click and payment, both are stochastic.\n* Across all the sub-campaigns, the total payment should not exceed the budget and the total (weighted) number of clicks over the total spend should be no less than the ROI threshold.\n\nNegative results:\n* SUBSET-SUM can be reduced to this problem, so one should not expect any efficient constraint approximation unless P = NP.\n* Either the regret is at least linear in number of rounds or the constraints will be violated at least a linear number of times.\n\nPositive results:\n* An algorithm guaranteeing sublinear regret that may violate the constraints a linear number of times. \n* An algorithm that violates the constraint at most a sublinear of times with linear regret bound.\n* An algorithm that achieves both sublinear in regret and number of violation times while relaxing the constraints by a small margin.\n\nExperiments with synthetic data are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms."

Moreover, how does this assumption affect the algorithm design and regret analysis?\n\n2. It seems to me that this work is an extension of [7]. What are the major new technical challenges of the problem studied in this paper compared to [7]? In addition, how significantly does the ROI constraint affect the difficulty of the bid optimization problem? Without clear illustrations of these questions, the technical novelty of this paper may be unclear.\n\n3. Theorem 1 seems to be a little straightforward. The authors may want to only preserve the statement of Theorem 1 but remove its proof (or replace it with a simpler proof sketch) as it is not very interesting.\n\n4. The experiments are numerical simulations, although I understand that this paper focuses more on theoretical analysis. If real datasets can be used in experiments, the quality of this paper can be enhanced a lot."
