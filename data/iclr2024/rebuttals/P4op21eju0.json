Is there a concrete metric defined to measure expressiveness and how does RLang perform?\n  - What if an agent started in a different position of the maze? Are the language advice still valid?\n  - In figure 5 (c), the advice is \"pick up the blue ball and drop it to your right\".  Here \"to your right\" is ambiguous, because it would depend on the direction in which the agent is facing, and how many grids to the right of the agent is another point of ambiguity. It is unclear to me how such ambiguity in natural language can be expressed accurately by RLang."

In fact, there are some papers that also used model-based approaches characterized by the LLM, such as [1-3]. The authors are encouraged to include these related works in their paper.\n2. The method works in a zero-shot manner, i.e., the LLM generates the model, reward etc before execution with provided prompts. The algorithm does not fully leverage the reasoning and reflecting abilities in LLMs, e.g., by summarizing errors made in approximating transitions and rewards. The performance of the algorithm highly depends on the quality of the prompts.\n3. The experiments are only conducted in very simple tabular environments, where the dynamics are pretty simple to infer. I have concerns regarding the effectiveness of the algorithm in more complex domains, where it would be necessary to incorporate reflection procedures.\n4. \"Language advice\" does not sound like a formal term and should be explicitly defined in the RL context.\n\n[1] Reasoning with Language Model is Planning with World Model.

The authors choose Minigrid environments as an idealized setting for language-conditioned RL. They write:\n\n>  Minigrid environments are an ideal setting for our experiments for three reasons: 1) they can be solved using tabular RL algorithms, which our informed, model- based RLang-Dyna-Q agent is based on; 2) there are clear and obvious referents of language in both the state and action spaces of these environments (e.g. keys, doors, and balls are represented neatly in a discrete state space and skills such as walking towards objects are easy to implement); 3) many objects are shared across environments enabling the reuse of a common RLang vocabulary for referencing these objects, which makes it easier for our translation pipeline to ground novel advice.\n\nI believe a large amount of hard RL environments, particularly in robotics or 1st-person video game environments, break all of these assumptions, and make language-conditioned RL difficult. While asking the authors to solve all of these environments is a bit unfair, I would like to see the authors tackle some harder environments with these properties. Otherwise, I believe it will be hard to convince outsiders to use these language-conditioned RL.\n\nNext, the authors do not have any baselines, only ablations. There are many methods that the authors mention in the related work that could serve as baselines. I also suspect that in these extremely simple Minigrid environments, an LLM can just directly solve it."

It would be interesting to conduct more ablations on different tasks.\n\nCan the authors compare against actual language RL baselines?
