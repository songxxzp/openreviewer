                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- Novelty: First of all, the paper is **not** the first to address Bayesian inference for CATE estimation/ uncertainty quantification: Already Jesson et al. (2020) showed that a Bayesian approach can quantify uncertainty due to lack of data/overlap in CATE estimation. Hence the contribution of the paper is to combine Bayesian inference for CATE with balanced representations, which in my opinion is a rather straightforward thing to do. The paper heavily builds upon the work of Shalit et al. (2017) who originally proposed the balanced representation framework. From my understanding, the only novel result is the Bayesian version of the original generalization bound (Theorem 1/2), which again builds heavily on the original bound proposed by Shalit et al.\n\n- Uncertainty quantification: From my understanding, the main benefit of using a Bayesian framework (and also the claim of the paper) is to allow for uncertainty quantification. However, in the experiments, the authors only evaluate performance in terms of point prediction. The \"uncertainty study\" provided evaluates some kind of robustness properties of the baselines, but **not** uncertainty for CATE estimation. I would have liked to see some experiments that evaluate the actual posterior CATE distribution, potentially showing benefits for decision-making as in Jesson et al (2020/2021).\n\n- Implementation: Some implementation details are not quite clear to me. From my understanding, the authors add the IPM penalty to the ELBO loss (Eq. 12). Here, it seems like the likelihood B from Eq. 11 is replaced with an L2 loss, which would imply that the likelihood is modeled as a Gaussian with learnable mean and constant variance. I am not sure if this is correct, as the likelihood was never properly defined in the paper. This also would render the method incapable of useful uncertainty quantification for heteroscedastic data. Finally, the details regarding hyperparameters of the baselines are not reported and no hyperparameter tuning was performed, which raises concerns regarding the validity of the experimental results.\n\n- Related to the previous point, **no Code is provided**, which makes it impossible to check the implementations of the proposed methods or the baselines. \n\n- I am aware that Shalit et al. call the estimand of interest individual treatment effect (ITE). However, the majority of causal inference literature agrees on the naming \"conditional average treatment effect\" (CATE) or \"heterogenous treatment effect\" (HTE), as the effect is not really \"individual\" (two different individuals with the same covariates have equal CATE). ITE is usually reserved for the (random) difference in potential outcomes $Y_1 - Y_0$. I would suggest changing the naming from ITE to CATE to be consistent with the literature.\n\n- Typos/Grammer/Notation: There is a substantial amount of typos, grammar issues, and notational inconsistencies in the paper, starting already with the **title** (Weight uncertainty in individual treatment effect). Some other examples: Appendix A.1 \"proofs in ITE\"; p.12 (top)\", we have the following results\"; Algorithm 1: $e \\in [0, E]$ (looks like continuous epochs).\n\n- Sec. 3 seems to provide (standard) background on Bayesian variational inference, not specific to the CATE setting. I suggest moving this section to the Appendix if space becomes an issue."

Why was only a simple normal distribution chosen as a variation family for the posterior? Please also provide all missing implementation details, including the code.\n\n- Can you assess the proposed method in terms of uncertainty quantification? Also, a comparison with previously proposed Bayesian CATE methods (Jesson et al 2020) would be nice."

Is it the uncertainty from the randomness of the\nsamples, or the prior, or anything else. It is also not clear to me what \"robust\" means in this context --- is it the robustness to distributional shift, or the \nrobustness in different environments, etc. I guess my main confusion is from understanding how the new method is \"incorporating the uncertainty\", and why it is  \"providing robust ITE estimation\".\nIt might be helpful to explicitly explain what these words mean as they appear multiple times in the paper.\n \n2. I am also confused by the two losses in definition 1. Consider the simplest case, where there are no covariates.\nThe factual loss is $P(T=1)\\int L(y,f(1))p(y|1)dy  + P(T=0)\\int L(y,f(0))p(y|0)dy $, \nand the counterfactual loss is $P(T=0)\\int L(y,f(0))p(y|0)dy  + P(T=1)\\int L(y,f(1))p(y|1)dy$ --- \naren't they the same thing? Would the $f(\\Phi(x),1-t)$ be, say,  $f(\\Phi(x),t)$  in the CF loss?\n\n\n3. On page 3, the beginning of Section 3, are $\\hat{Y}$ or $w$ defined?\n\n4. Theorem 2 establishes an upper bound for $E_{f,\\Phi\\sim \\rho}\\epsilon_{\\text{PEHE}}(f,\\Phi)$. \nIt is a bit hand-wavy to me why optimizing the objective function obtained from the upper bound \nwould lead to a more \"robust\" model.
