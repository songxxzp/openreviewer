                    "value": "This paper proposes a post-hoc OOD detection algorithm HAct by modeling the statistics of the activation weights of some linear layers of a pretrained network. Specifically, the class-wise average of the activation histograms is used as prototypes and are used to compare with the statistics of test images. A subsampling is employed to speed up computation. The proposed method shows impressive performance on the ImageNet-1K ID dataset using ResNet50 and MobileNet-v2."

By the softmax prediction, or by the distance between the average activatioln histograms?\n    - (b) P4L12, \"... to return ID if all the OOD detectors for all layers return ID\". Firstly, How the $\\tau$'s are determined when multiple layers are used. In the evaluation metric FPR95, the threshould should be chosen s.t. TPR=95%. Is this guaranteed when multiple $\\tau$'s are used?\n    - (c) How to compute AUROC when multiple layers are used? Importantly, how to aggragate the scores from multiple layers to one score? It is unclear in the text since the ID/OOD-ness from different layers are combined logically rather than numerically.\n    - (d) P3 Equ. (1). How the partition values $\\alpha_1, \\cdots, \\alpha_m$ are determined and what's the typical values of $m$ and $\\alpha_i$ in experiments? What's the effect of $\\alpha_i, i>1$ on performance?\n\n2. Lack of reference and comparison to related work. The classical baselines MSP [a], Mahalanobis [b], etc. are not reviewed and compared.\n\n3. Insufficient experiment on more network structures and on more datasets. How about models like BiT, RepVGG? Alos, the SUN and Places dataset are quite noisy as the OOD dataset for ImageNet-1K. A large portion of their images are overlapped with the ID dataset [c]. Please test on OpenImage-O [d] and ImageNet-O [e].\n\n4. Can this method be applicable to vision transformers?\n\n- [a] \"A Baseline for Detecting Misclassified and Out-of-Distribution Examples in Neural Networks.\" ICLR 2016.\n- [b] \"A simple unified framework for detecting out-of-distribution samples and adversarial attacks.\" NeurIPS 2018.\n- [c] \"In or Out?

                    "value": "Other than the questions raised in the weakness section, my main question is on the evaluation practice in the experiments. As mentioned in the weakness part, the evaluated OOD dataset is very noisy and many ID images are mixed in the OOD dataset. So it is counter-intuitive that the FPR95 could reach 0.x% and AUROC reach 99%. Please clarify the evaluation process. Specifically, (a) is the validation set of ImageNet-1K used in the computation of FPR95/AUROC? The training set for tuning the histogram should be independent of the val set used for evaluation. (b) pretend that the test set of ImageNet-1K is an OOD dataset of ImageNet-1K, and please test the AUROC of your method."

The performance on ImageNet benchmark is extremely high, as shown in Table 1, but there is a lack of relevant discussion and explanation, which are supposed to provide valuable insights to the community.\n2. Besides, as HAct performs OOD detection by comparing with the activation histogram of predicted category $c^*$ (if I did not misunderstand), now that HAct can accurately identify the samples belongs to $c^*$ or is just an OOD, the ID classification accuracy should correspondingly be extremely high, which however is not displayed in Table 1.\n3. Consequently, in Table 2, HAct's performance on the relatively simpler CIFAR benchmark instead gets much worse than the more complicated ImageNet benchmark. Reasonable discussions should be given.\n4. Regarding the methodology, In Section 3.1, why this paper chooses the absolute value of $|W_{ij} * x_j|$ to compute the histogram, rather than the commonly-used ReLU or the network's original activation functions? Why the bias is not considered when computing the activation histograms? If the initial network has bias parameters, will all the biases just be ignored?"

Am I missing something here? Can we also show that we can obtain 95% accuracy on Places, which would also be state of the art on this dataset (and others?) by a large margin for both MobileNet and ResNet."
