We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n**2.** The main advantage of this training method is that it allows us to train a single model to be capable of performing inference at various latencies without significant drop in performance. To our knowledge, no other work attempts to build such a model. Our motivation is slightly different in that instead of targeting a specific device with a model, we train a single model that can be used on any targeted devices within a certain hardware scope. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n**3.** Thank you for pointing this out. Correct, we also found the SR model is sensitive to changes in removal of this layer. We found that using regularization to make the mapping layer to have very small weights somewhat mitigates this issue. We still observe a drop in performance compared to having the mapping layer. However, having no regularization or too large regularization thresholds can result in a much more significant drop in performance. The threshold we used has been tuned to make the performance drop to what we feel are within acceptable limits. We will add these details in the paper."

                    "value": "Super-resolution models significantly enhance the visual quality of low-resolution images. However, a notable limitation is their challenging adaptability to different hardware platforms, given the platform diversity. Moreover, these models often lack consideration for the runtime environment in which they operate. This environment can substantially impact their performance, influenced by both the hardware characteristics and available runtime resources. In response to these limitations, this paper introduces AdaSR, a solution designed to address these challenges. AdaSR employs a progressive knowledge distillation model training approach, which optimizes memory usage by dynamically adjusting depth and channel sizes based on the specific hardware during runtime while maintaining accuracy as much as possible. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaSR to a certain extent."

In Chapter 3.2.1, it is mentioned, \u201c... increase the size of the adaptable model, ... and repeat the process ...\u201d. The question is: When increasing the size each time, are all blocks in the adaptable model synchronized? For instance, do block 1 through block M increase to the same block size and channel size each time? If this is the case, does this approach iterate through all possible solutions within the search space?\n3. Is it feasible to apply or extend this approach to non-block-based models?\n4. In the experimental setup, the parameters beta_1 and beta_2 for the ADAM optimizer are set to the same values as those in the FAKD approach. Are there specific reasons for maintaining these parameters consistent with FAKD?\n5. It would be beneficial to include information about the available memory spaces in the experiments, as it is a crucial factor in characterizing the dynamic runtime environment.\n6. In Table 1, the significance of the bold values is ambiguous. They do not represent the best performance in the comparisons. More detailed clarifications are required.\n7. Chapter 4.2 does not sufficiently demonstrate AdaSR's robust adaptability in a dynamic runtime environment. An ablation study may be necessary, as it is an important statement declared in the Introduction. This is particularly relevant for showcasing AdaSR's adaptability in a dynamic runtime when \u201cother running applications are present.\u201d\n8. A minor writing issue: In Chapter 3.3, there is a phrase, \u201c... we a training method with ...\u201d"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and feedback. We address the concerns as follows -\n\n**1.** Since we perform layer-wise training, we undergo more back-propagation iterations than if we were to train the full model at once. The total number of iterations would be *N* x *C* x *e* where *N* is the number of blocks, *C* is the number of channel sizes. and *e* the number of epochs till convergence. However, the relative cost of each backpropagation is cheaper since we freeze all previous layers, and only train one layer at a time. To give an estimate, our base CARN model requires 8 GPU days to fully train to convergence on a 1080Ti GPU. We will add these details to our paper.\n\n**2.** Yes, we iterate through each possible solution. However, we can reduce this exploration space depending on what devices we may possibly target. We will add this detail to the paper.\n\n**3.** At this stage we have only worked on block based models. Applying this method will be challenging to non-block based models since the granularity at which layers can be progressively distilled across needs to be determined first, which is an extra research question to address. However, if that can be done, there is a possibility of applying this method to non-block based architectures as well.\n\n**4.** We tried several other parameters, and this gave the overall best results. That said, this had little performance impact compared to others. \n\n**5.** This is a good point, we will add this in our results.\n\n**6.** Thank you for pointing this out. We will remove the bold font from our model names.\n\n**7.** Thank you for pointing this out. We will add more ablation studies on this.\n\n**8.** Thank you, we will fix this."

It is confusing and ambiguous for the experiment settings for the cross-platform and dynamic runtime environment.\n\n- The evaluations for \"cross-platform Pareto optimality\" (Sec. 4.1) and \"dynamic runtime environment\" (Sec. 4.2) are conducted on a very small test set, i.e., set14, Fig.3 and Fig.4. I do not think those results are convincing.  \n\n- In Sec. 4.3, \"to support adapting models for cross-platform deployment and dynamic runtime environment, AdaSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, AdaSR achieves state-of-the-art performance\". However, Tab.1 just shows the results on existing SR datasets. How can we learn from those evaluation results and how to demonstrate the effectiveness under cross-platform deployment and dynamic runtime environment?"

Our claim of being suitable for dynamic runtime environments hinges on the fact that our model can change its inference latency on the fly without requiring the reloading of models from disk to memory. We will clarify this in the paper. For our experiments for cross-platform compatibility, we demonstrate that a single model can perform at various latencies across various platforms without the need to reload new models (see Figure 4). This is not achieved by the state-of-the-art we compare against. For demonstration of dynamic runtime effectiveness, in Figure 4 that our model can achieve a variety of latencies in the same session dynamically. We will work on making these points clearer in the paper.\n\n**2.** We perform our experiments on a variety of test sets, as shown in Table 1. We limit to plotting only the graphs in Figure 3 due to space. We will add the rest of the experimental results in the Appendix.\n\n**3.** This section is for directly comparing model performance to similarly sized models. We show here that our method can effectively reduce the model sizes with minimal loss of performance since it is competitive with other state-of-the-art."
