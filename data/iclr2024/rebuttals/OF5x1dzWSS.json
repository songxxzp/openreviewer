                    "value": "1. The proposed framework addresses the issues of heuristics and non-uniform robust performance in adversarial training. The authors use a doubly robust optimization (DRO) approach that is theoretically grounded. It provides a principled way to reweight the training examples based on their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. \n\n2. Even the algorithm falls under the category of iteratively-reweighted adversarial attack, this paper has a more principled optimization formulation than previous works because its DRO approach combines two different models to estimate the importance weights of each training example, and to estimate the importance weights, which is more robust to model misspecification and can handle a wider range of distributional shifts compared to traditional optimization methods. The obtained weights are optimal for the DRO optimization problem defined in Eq. 5 (with the closed-form exact solution for the weights), rather than being ad-hoc picked. This is the most important difference form previous instance-wise or iterative attacks.\n\n3. The bilevel optimization formulation of AT gives one the flexibility to separately design the inner and outer level objectives. This enables the authors to independently construct a new outer level objective that also solves for the instance weights w, and an inner level objective for regularized attack. This flexibility allows for a more generic and powerful framework than the traditional AT formulation, which is limited to a single objective function.\n\n4. The proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on standard classification datasets, in terms of robustness against multiple adversarial attacks. They also show that their method can improve the robustness of the weakest (worst-case) data points, which is an important property for real-world applications."

                        "value": "Thank you for your thorough reviews and constructive comments. We provide our response to your comments below. \n\nQ1: Since the algorithm requires computing Jacobian inner products to perform parameter updates in the bi-level optimization, could the authors comment on the incurred time complexity? I am wondering if the algorithm runs much slower than vanilla AT (but only improves the robust accuracy moderately). \n\nA1: Many thanks for this useful question! We agree that Jacobian-vector product computation in bilevel optimization may cause additional compute burden. However, in terms of complexity it is a known fact from automatic differentiation that computing a Jacobian-vector product has order-wise (up to a constant) the same time and space complexity of gradient computation when reverse-mode automatic differentiation is employed (please see Griewank & Walther, (2008) or  Baydin et al. (2015) for a shorter version). \n\nMoreover, we also conducted additional experiments that use a first-order approximation of our hypergradient estimator (i.e., we ignore the second part of the hypergradient $\\nabla L(\\theta)$ that contains the second-order computation due to bilevel optimization). We found that our algorithm still maintains the same performance level while achieving exactly the same running-time as standard AT. For example on the CIFAR10, we obtain for the DONE-GD algorithm: 83.13% SA and 57.28% RA-PGD. These new results suggest that the instance weights optimization using DRO is in fact the most important feature of our algorithm. We will include more results about these findings in our revision. \n\nQ2: In their experiments, the authors have compared with AutoAttack which is good, but not with other SOTA methods such as TRADES or Diffusion-based Defense (ICML 2023). Adding some more comparison method would be good. \nA2:  Many thanks for the suggestions! We have conducted new experiments following the most recent SOTA in [1] published in ICML\u201923 (we assume the reviewer refers to the diffusion-based defense method in [1]). The study in [1] uses a larger CIFAR10 dataset augmented with millions of synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. Note that this falls under a category of new models that boost the performance of adversarial defense using self-supervised learning on tens of millions of additional synthetic images.  With this boosting strategy, our DONE-GD algorithm achieves 86.65% SA and 60.74% AA for the ResNet18 model. As a comparison, [1] achieves 86.42% SA and 58.51% AA. We will include those results in our revision. In our final version, we will also try to add more larger datasets such as one of the imageNet derivatives (tiny imagenet or tiered imagenet). \n\nUsually the TRADES approach is an orthogonal approach and can be used on top of other methods to improve performance against autoAttacks. By the reviewer\u2019s suggestion and for completeness, we will include the comparison with TRADES in our revision. \n\nReference: \n\n[1] Better Diffusion Models Further Improve Adversarial Training.

We provide our response to your comments below. \n\nQ1: The improvements on PGD and AutoAttack seem to be less significant. The more significant improvements are observed from RA-Tail-30. Therefore, it is necessary to provide more details of the evaluation protocol for RA-Tail-30. \n\nA1: Many thanks for this useful comment! As we discuss in the introduction, a critical limitation of the conventional AT method is that it suffers a severe non-uniform performance across the empirical distribution. For example, while the average robust performance of the AT method on the CIFAR10 dataset can be as high as 49%, the robust accuracy for the weakest class is as low as 14%, which depicts a huge disparity in robust performance across different classes. So based on this critical remark, we propose the RA-Tail-30 metric which represents the robust performance (i.e., RA-PGD) on the 30% most vulnerable classes, and hence can be seen as a proxy measure of the robustness against attacks on the most vulnerable data points. \n\nQ3: Comparisons with more recent adversarial training methods are missing. \n\nA3: Many thanks for the suggestions! We have conducted new experiments to compare with [1] published in ICML\u201923, which is the most recent adversarial training SOTA. Note that [1] is a diffusion-based defense method and falls under a category of new models that boost the performance of adversarial defense using self-supervised learning on tens of millions of additional synthetic images. For example [1] uses the latest SOTA diffusion model to generate tens of millions of synthetic images for CIFAR10 to boost the adversarial robustness. \nWe've conducted a new experiment using 1 million images generated for CIFAR10 by the same diffusion model as in [1]. Using this, our DONE-GD algorithm achieves 86.65% SA and 60.74% AA for the Resnet18 model. As a comparison, [1] achieves 86.42% SA and 58.51% AA. We will include those results in our final revision. \n\nQ3: Since the advantage is mainly demonstrated at the imbalanced dataset, the current evaluations on Imbalanced datasets (CIFAR10 and SVHN imbalanced) are not enough for analyzing the performance breakpoint.

Consequently, the authors follow the setting of Zhang et al. 2022  (bilevel optimization formulation for AT) and add the instance reweighting mechanism into it. Moreover, the authors seek to  build a model in the outer level problem that is robust not only to the adversarial examples but also to the worst-case attack distribution.  Compared with the exisiting instance reweighting AT methods, the proposed method  obtain the importance weights by distributionally robust optimization (DRO). The DRO is a more sophisticated choice than the heuristic/geometric schemes of instance rewweighting. Furthermore, the authors propose an equivalent compositional optimization problem (Eq. (6)) and adopt the log-barrier penalty function to drop the challenging $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm constraint. The final optimization problem is Eq. (7) and the authors modify SCGD into the compositional implicit differentiation (CID) algorithm to solve it. With some common used assumptions, the authors establish the convegence result for CID. \nIn the experimental studies, the authors compare three instance re-weighted adversarial training methods with the proposed method on four small-scale datasets. The proposed method show promising improvement on RA-PGD, RA-Tail-30 and RA-AA metric."

                        "value": "Thank you for your thorough reviews and constructive comments. We provide our response to your comments below. \n\nQ1: In Eq. (7)\uff0cis the constraint $\\delta \\in \\mathcal{C}_i$ correct? The author claimed that\n\"Note that now the constraint  $\\delta \\in \\mathcal{C}_i  is never binding in eq. (7), because the log-barrier penalty forces the minimizer of $\\ell_i^{bar}(\\theta, \\delta)$ to be strictly inside the constraint set\". Moreover, in Algorithm 1 line 5-7, why need the projected operator to keep  $\\delta_{i,t}^k \\in \\mathcal{C}$. \n\nA1: Many thanks for this useful question! Yes, the constraint $\\delta \\in \\mathcal{C}_i$ is correct but \\emph{it can be dropped} in eq. (7) because we know that the minimizer of the log-barrier loss $\\ell_i^{bar}(\\theta, \\delta)$ has to be strictly inside the constraint set. In other words, the minimizer of the constrained problem is the same as the non-constrained one (hence we referred to the constraint as never binding). \n\nFurther, note that $\\hat \\delta^*_i(\\theta)  in eq. (7) corresponds to the true minimizer of $\\ell_i^{bar}(\\theta, \\delta)$ and we know that it is strictly inside the constraint set. However, the algorithm iterates $\\delta_{i,t}^k \\in \\mathcal{C} (which are approximations of $\\hat \\delta^*_i(\\theta)$) might be outside the constraint set, and hence we need to have the projection operator to push them back into the constraint set if they do fall outside. The main purpose of the log-barrier regularizer is to favor differentiability and guarantee the existence of the implicit gradient. \n\n\n\nQ2: It is better to discuss the justifiability of Assumption 1-3 for AT problem.\n\nA2: Thanks for the suggestion! Assumptions 1-3 are standard assumptions widely adopted in bilevel optimization literature [Ji \u201821; Grazzi \u201820]. Specifically, Assumption 3 characterizes the variance of cost function over data samples, which is typically bounded. Assumptions 1-2 require the Lipschitzness of the objective function and its first- and second-order derivatives, which is crucial for analyzing convergence performance of bilevel optimization. \n\n\nQ3: The SA performance is a weakness of the proposed method. It is better to explain this limitation. \n\nA3: This is indeed an important comment! Yes, while our approach generally improves the robust performance, it did not improve the SA (but it still has comparable SA performance with the other baselines). In order to further investigate this in terms of the overall performance (i.e., SA-RA tradeoff) of our approach, we have run new experiments with evaluations on 70% clean-30% adversarial, 50% clean-50% adversarial; 30% clean-70% adversarial; and all are randomly i.i.d. chosen. This captures the practical real world scenarios where only fractions of the input data are attacked. We provide the experimental results for the CIFAR10 dataset below.  Note that Xc-Ya means performance on  X% clean and Y% adversarial. \n\n| method | 0c-100a | 30c-70a | 50c-50a | 70c-30a| 100c-0a |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | -- | -- |\n| Ours | 57.46 | 65.41 | 70.15 | 75.38 | 83.41|\n| AT | 49.29 | 59.33 | 66.02 | 72.29 | 82.1 |\n\nWe found that our method is still able to interpolate on the good decent standard and robust accuracy. We thank the reviewer for bringing this up and will include those discussions in our final revision. \n\nQ4: The computational analysis is missing. \n\nA4: Thanks for the comment! Compared to the conventional AT method, only the Jacobian-vector product computation due to bilevel optimization may cause additional compute burden. However, in terms of time and memory complexity it is a known fact from automatic differentiation that computing a Jacobian-vector product has order-wise (up to a constant) the same time and space complexity of gradient computation when reverse-mode automatic differentiation is employed (please see [Griewank 08\u2019] or  [Baydin 15\u2019] for a shorter version). \n\nMoreover, we also conducted additional experiments that use a first-order approximation of our hypergradient estimator (i.e., we ignore the second part of the hypergradient $\\nabla L(\\theta)$ that contains the second-order computation due to bilevel optimization). We found that our algorithm still maintains the same performance level while achieving exactly the same running-time as standard AT. For example on the CIFAR10, we obtain for the DONE-GD algorithm: 83.13% SA and 57.28% RA-PGD. These new results suggest that the instance weights optimization using DRO is in fact the most important feature of our algorithm. We will include more results about these findings in our revision."

We have conducted new experiments following the most recent SOTA in [1] published in ICML\u201923, which uses a larger CIFAR10 dataset augmented with 1 million synthetic images generated by a diffusion model. Note that this falls under a category of new models that boost the performance of adversarial defense using self-supervised learning on tens of millions of additional synthetic images.  With this boosting strategy, our DONE-GD algorithm achieves 86.65% SA and 60.74% AA for the ResNet18 model. As a comparison, [1] achieves 86.42% SA and 58.51% AA. We will include those results in our revision. In our final version, we will also try to add more larger datasets such as one of the imageNet derivatives (tiny imagenet or tiered imagenet). \n\n\n\nQ6: It is better to add some statistical analyses like P-values, CIs, effect sizes, and so on. \n\nA6: We thank the reviewer for the useful suggestions!

The lower the p-value, the higher significance of our advantage over AT. \nClearly in the above table, these results (all p-values less than 0.05) show that our method has a meaningful and consistent performance advantage over the AT method across these metrics for this dataset.
