See the following works and properly discuss, compare with them.\n- R Arora et al., Understanding Deep Neural Networks with Rectified Linear Units, ICLR 2018\n- Z Chen et al., A Generalized Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis for Two-layer Neural Networks, NeurIPS 2020\n- G Yang & E Littwin, Tensor Programs IIb: Architectural Universality of Neural Tangent Kernel Training Dynamics, ICML 2021\n- M Seleznova & G Kutyniok, Neural Tangent Kernel Beyond the Infinite-Width Limit: Effects of Depth and Initialization, ICML 2022\n- T Gao et al., A global convergence theory for deep ReLU implicit networks via over-parameterization, ICLR 2022\nThese works also dealt with the training of neural networks using NTK for two-layer or more general networks. It is very critical to properly discuss prior works and clearly present / demonstrate the proposed method over them.\n\nQ2. There are a number of claims without showing anything. For example, \"It\u2019s important to highlight that for s > 1 the decay speed may surpass that of a pure ReLU neural network.\" or \"It is important to note that for cases with M > 2, all the analyses presented here can be readily extended.\" For me, they were not straightforward. Unclear claims should be clarified or be removed.\n\nQ3. I am afraid that the applicability of this work is quite limited considering that modern deep learning heavily utilizes transformers and other advanced architectures.\n\nQ4. Comparing only with Adam in the experiments seems limited. Note that Adam does not have to be the best for all cases. Comparing with other methods seems desirable."

For instance, (Ergen and Pilanci, in AISTATS 2020) proved the convex geometry of two-layer ReLU networks, and based on this result, the acceleration of convergence using gradient based algorithms, like the proposed one, seems straightforward by modifying learning rates. I\u2019d like to correct my comments if I am wrong.\n\n2. Unconvincing empirical results: For instance,\n(1) The tasks are not commonly used in evaluating the optimizers.\n(2) The comparative optimizer is only Adam, even with no sgd that is most similar to the proposed algorithm.\n(3) Learning rates are decreased in training, while in the algorithm there is no such procedure.\n(4) No learning rate schedulers are compared.\nWithout such details, I hardly justify the correctness and fairness of the experiments."

The notation is also not clearly defined. For instance, equations (20) and (21) should be given in the main text, and the definition of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is not clearly defined in (3). \nThe experiment settings also do not look very right to me. In the first experiment, the authors use a so-called two-step process with two values of $s$, i.e., 0.5/1.5 and 1. This is very different from what is claimed in the theory where the homotopy parameter $s$ is increased at each step. Also, the number of samples is just 100, which would be too small. It is also hard to disentangle the effect of the choice of $s$ and other hyperparameters. I would suggest the authors use vanilla SGD for comparison rather than Adam."

Both of them are sets. \n\npage 8 before figures: $\\sigma_{\\frac32}(x) := -\\frac12 \\mathrm{Id}(x) + \\frac32 \\mathrm{ReLU}(x)$"
