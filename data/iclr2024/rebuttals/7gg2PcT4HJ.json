Why does this work use the hybrid learning to solve the problem\uff1f\n2. Details are poorly represented, e.g., the source of a priori knowledge graphs and the source of query samples. Due to the lack of some specific explanations, the formulation of the method makes it difficult to understand. Thus, the readers cannot basically reproduce this method.\n3. The presentation of this manuscript need to be revised, for example:\n- the 3rd sentence of the 5th paragraph of INTRODUCTION, the dimension alignment should put before the aggregation of hybrid local graphs;\n- The first paragraph of section 3.2.2, \"Moreover...\" , whether a node can perform message passing is independent of whether it is an undirected graph or not.\n4. The writing in this manuscript should be polished thoroughly, for example\n- There is a lot of reuse of sentences (Abstract) in both INTRODUCTION and METHOD;\n- Some descriptions about prototype in section 3.2.1 need be modified, e.g., the explanation for Eqn.(4)."

Figure 2 shows inherent differences between a priori knowledge graph based on textual semantics and a dynamic prototype based on visual semantics. But Eq.2 in Section 3.1 indicates that the learned visual features are allowed to approximate the textual features of the a priori knowledge, does this compromise the learned visual semantic knowledge?\n\n3. What does q in Eq.5 stand for? Is it the batch size? This will make the prototype nodes and the single-batch inner nodes placed in a single graph. Does only one mapping matrix preserve the consistency of their semantic space? This should be the core part of the work, could you provide some theoretical proof or more explanation?"

In the abstract, the authors discuss the very interesting motivation of mimicking human learning with structured knowledge. However, the rest of the abstract goes directly to how each module is constructed and 'communicates' with each other. What's the goal of each module, and how does each module fulfills the goal remain highly unclear. Concepts like 'global node' even appear without any proper explanation of the functionalities and motivations. \n\n2. The last paragraph discusses the shortcomings of the existing methods without providing any support or evidence. What's the result of 'suffer from inefficient knowledge fusion issues and under-utilize the knowledge embedded in the graph' that the authors observed? This can hardly be an observation without presenting what the authors actually observed. \n\nMy low review confidence is mainly due to the fact that I believe a vast amount of necessary discussions is missing in this paper, making it hard to evaluate the contributions comprehensively."

Neural network learn parameters across all layers which associatively convey knowledge about the learned task, and the feature propagation across layers can be considered as a form of information querying in an associative memory. What's the limitation of such global information that makes the proposed layer indispensable?\n\n2. Please briefly explain how exactly the information granularities are aligned in the proposed layer. Are there any quantitative evaluations of the term 'granularity' that can support the claim? \n\n3. Section 3.2, what does the 'prior knowledge' represent here? Is it equal to the global graph?\n\n4. How many parameters does the proposed layer have compared to the standard linear layer? I believe many of the performance improvements are relatively marginal, especially for the ones with strong backbones, could the parameter size be a major reason of the improvement? \n\n5. Please briefly explain how the proposed method aids model interpretation."
