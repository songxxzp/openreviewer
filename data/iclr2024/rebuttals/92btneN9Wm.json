                    "value": "The paper proposes a novel architecture for coordinate-based networks used for signal representation. The key contribution of this architecture is that the activation function is changed to a sinusoidal function multiplied by a damping function. This result leads to improvement over existing activations which either use ReLU, and have a spectral bias towards low-frequency functions, or use sinusoidal activations, which do not have a notion of locality due to the lack of damping factor and thus lead to poorer reconstructions. This contribution is justified empirically by showing that it leads to significantly better signal fits on image signals."

                    "value": "In my opinion, the strengths of the paper are:\n1. The paper is presented exceptionally clearly. The activation function and possible choices are explained very well, and the reasoning for the chosen function is justified intuitively, and there are theoretical guarantees on the Lipschitz constant of the function represented by the network. I view this as very valuable as the paper can have more impact if researchers understand the reason for the increase in performance, as this is under-explored area of activation functions in coordinate-based networks.\n2. The comparisons show that the proposed SPDER activation function leads to significant improvement over positional encoding, SIREN, and ReLU networks in signal memorization tasks. This shows that the relatively simple contribution does lead to an improvement in what is claimed, and has the potential to be impactful."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "In my opinion, the weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. I think that additional experiments could be used as there are other coordinate-based network architectures which claim improvements over positional encoding and SIREN architectures. I'm not sure why Instant-NGP is chosen here, as it is a hybrid implicit-explicit representation and is very different from the other coordinate-based networks. I believe a better fit would be [1] or [2], which show that simple networks with different activations, structures, or positional embeddings can improve on the FF/SIREN architectures. \n2. Following the additional experiments thread, I'm not sure why comparisons on radiance field fitting are not included. While interesting as a toy problem, image signal representation is not very useful in many computer vision tasks, besides maybe super-resolution. However, coordinate-based networks have been very useful in computer graphics, where they can be used in solving inverse problems and reconstructing 3D from 2D. Not including an experiment on radiance field, which is the most impactful field where an improvement in coordinate-based network fitting would be utilized, leads me to believe that the impact of the method is severely limited due to some unknown reason, perhaps speed or memory constraints in the architecture?\n3. Even simpler than radiance field fitting, I don't understand why there is no experiment on overfitting 3D shapes, such as SDFs? This is where coordinate-based networks originated, and could be used as a compressive representation. The paper mentions compressive signal representations in the conclusion, but there is no study on how effective SPDER is for this - no study on memory consumption, or size of networks needed to reach an acceptable level of quality. This is usually done when trying to represent 3D objects with SDFs, so this leads me to believe the method may have some limitations here.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=OmtmcPkkhT\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01553"

                "questions": {
                    "value": "I do not have any additional questions on the paper, as it is described very clearly. Overall, I think that the contribution of the paper is strong due to its simplicity and demonstrated improvement on image-signal overfitting tasks. However, I think that the evaluations are limited - there are other coordinate-based network architectures which lead to improvement over the baselines which are compared to here, and most importantly, the method is not compared on radiance fields, which is the most impactful application of coordinate-based networks. I think that addressing these two weaknesses would make the paper significantly stronger and in that case I would be happy to raise my score.\n\n**Update after author response**\n\nAfter reading the author response, I am not inclined to change my score. While I appreciate the additional comparisons, and I believe the paper does a convincing job showing that overfitting image signals can be done extremely well with SPDER, I think the paper weakness is justifying *why* this is a relevant problem. The method seems to not work on radiance fields, has not been shown to work on SDFs, nor am I sure it offers compression benefits in overfitting image signals. Thus, I'm not sure what application it would be used in. On the other hand, there is no theoretical proof that it is able to encode a wider frequency band of signals, only empirical results on a relatively narrow range of experiments. With further work, I believe the paper could make a meaningful contribution, but in this state I remain borderline."

[\u2026] I believe a better fit would be [1] or [2], which show that simple networks with different activations, structures, or positional embeddings can improve on the FF/SIREN architectures.**\n\nFollowing the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we ran additional experiments applying SPDER activations to the models from both of the suggested baselines: GaborNet from MFN [1] and Spline Positional Encoding [2]. Then, we evaluate these new models on the same image dataset as the original MFN paper [1].\n\n**PSNRS**\n| Training Steps | 5-layer SPDER | 5-layer GaborNet | Spline | 3-layer SPDER | 3-layer GaborNet |\n|----------------|---------------|------------------|--------|---------------|------------------|\n| 500            | 75.32         | 49.14            | 29.73  | 33.97         | 46.59            |\n| 1000           | 78.01         | 56.07            | 38.87  | 38.62         | 52.78            |\n| 5000           | 78.01         | 69.71            | 44.40  | 41.44         | 67.08            |\n| 10000          | **108.40**        | 77.65            | 65.86  | 41.44         | 71.98            |\n\nTo highlight the difference, SPDER beats the best GaborNet loss in 800 steps and the best Spline loss in 300 steps. SPDER\u2019s representation is lossless because the loss is so small it doesn\u2019t show up on an 8-bit scale (not true for the others, see Appendix A.13). The 5-layer SPDER (which we tested in our paper) has significantly higher PSNRs than the others in very few training steps, meaning it is also very efficient.\n\nWe will be sure to include these results in the main paper.\n\n**> I'm not sure why Instant-NGP is chosen here, as it is a hybrid implicit-explicit representation and is very different from the other coordinate-based networks.**\n\nIts paper says it is \u201cstate-of-the-art quality on a variety of tasks\u201d related to image representation. We wanted to show our simple MLP can beat this complicated setup which requires a heavy GPU setup.\n\nAlso stated in Appendix A.8, our method could also be combined with a hierarchical one like Instant-NGP, as it is more efficient. \n\n**Comparisons on radiance fields and SDFs**\n\nWe observed that SPDER works for signals that can be well approximated in a low dimensional representation over a frequency domain. For example, an image can be well approximated by using the discrete cosine transform (JPEG). Similar methods exist for audio and video. To the extent of our knowledge, domains like SDFs or radiance fields do not exhibit a similar property. We hypothesize that this fact renders SPDER ineffective in these domains (mentioned at the bottom of page 4). This is likely an instance of the \u201cno free lunch\u201d theorem; no single architecture can perform the best on all modalities. \n\nWe anticipate there can be future work on projecting these modalities into a vector space where SPDER\u2019s activation functions can perform effectively. We believe this is reasonable as current methods for SDFs and radiance fields are generally divided into two parts: 1) preprocessing/conditioning 2) MLP. Our current implementation only uses the latter.\n\nThe main claim of our paper is that existing models are prone to the inductive bias of not being able to encode all frequencies, which we show our simple MLP overcomes. This is due to the \u201cdamping factor\u201d in the nonlinearity (i.e. the square root in $\\sin(x) * \\sqrt{|x|})$ which allows the network to remember where inputs came from. This is most evident in the image case."

An example is a statement of the form: \"We demonstrate how SPDER not only has incredibly low loss\", can be restated as \"We demonstrate how SPDER not only has significantly lower loss\" etc. This is a minor point, admittedly my personal taste."

This can be important for real-world applications.**\n\nThe implicit neural representations should \u201coverfit\u201d to the signal or the object it is being trained on, as the goal is essentially to learn a mapping from pixel position to pixel value for a single object. The desired generalization is *between* the pixels in an image or between frames in a video. Our experiments demonstrate this generalization effect in the image superresolution task (Section 4.3, Appendix A.5), audio interpolation (Section 4.4, Appendix A.6), and video interpolation (Section 4.5, Appendix A.7).\n\nRegarding video examples, we report on two videos (not one). They are \u201cBig Buck Bunny\u201d and \u201cBikes\u201d, which are from skvideo and are standard in video computer vision research (Appendix A.7). \n\n**> I am not an expert in this space, but one question I have is whether the baselines are strong. SIREN is the most commonly used baseline. Maybe the authors can provide some perspective in this regard.**\n\nWe compared SPDER to the most popular coordinate-based MLP models we found in the existing literature. Most of these models are simple neural networks. We also compared our work to Instant-NGP (Section 4.2 Image Representation), which uses a much more complicated setup and is state-of-the-art for many INR tasks.\n\n**> Lastly, I would recommend the authors, in the spirit of academic inquiry, to tone down the language a little bit.**\n\nWe will change the wording accordingly."

It contains an activation function composed of a sinusoidal multiplied by a sublinear function.\nThe sinusoidal enables the network to automatically learn the positional encoding of an input coordinate while the damping passes on the actual coordinate value by preventing it from being projected down to within a finite range of values.\nFurther experiments demonstrated good performance on multiple downstream tasks such as image super-resolution and video frame interpolation."
