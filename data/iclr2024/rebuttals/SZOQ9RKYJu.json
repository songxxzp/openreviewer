I feel that the main contribution is a new IT-related dataset.\n2. The authors propose HMCE. But I think it's kind of illy described. After reading, I am not sure what advantages the HMCE offer. From my current understanding, it seems that the authors want to break the long inputs into pieces and still want to have a good likelihood estimator. Considering so many long context modeling techniques proposed recently, I am not sure why the author only mentioned the unpublished work NBCE.\n3. On evaluation, are there any duplications from the dataset the authors construct and the authors used to eval? If so, the evaluation results are not convincing. This should be stated clearly."

                        "value": "**Q1: limited novelty**     \n\nA1: The prevailing understanding within the AI community is that general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 exhibit limitations when tasked with domain-specific challenges. Attempts to employ prompt engineering as a means to infuse expert knowledge into LLMs and steer them toward providing solutions have yielded inconsistent and suboptimal outcomes. This has led to a collective agreement on the necessity of constructing large-scale models that are intricately tailored to specific vertical domains, ensuring a higher degree of precision and effectiveness in their performance[1][2]. The development of our model first represents a dedicated endeavor tailored to the nuances of IT operations and maintenance (O&M) in specific domains. It is the culmination of meticulous expertise and specialized knowledge. The data that fuels this innovation is of immense value\u2014our carefully curated fine-tuned dataset, along with the benchmark data, is a testament to the labor-intensive process of manual labeling and collection, achieved without the crutch of data augmentation techniques. Besides, our approach is generalizable and can be easily migrated to other fields. The originality and ingenuity of our approach have not gone unnoticed, garnering acclaim from our peers in the field. Our innovativeness is also recognized by other reviewers.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] https://github.com/luban-agi/Awesome-Domain-LLM\n\n[2] BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance"

                        "value": "**W3: Duplications and more convincing evaluation**\n\nA3: Our benchmark and instruction dataset have no overlap. To ensure data quality, we have employed the MinHash method[5][6] for deduplication. MinHash is used for estimating the similarity between datasets and is particularly useful in large-scale clustering problems. The main idea is to reduce the dimensionality of the datasets by converting large sets into smaller fingerprints while preserving the similarity information.\n\nBesides, For more convincing results, we also provide a human evaluation on the Q&A test. For the Q&A test, we supplement it with human scoring and provide the Pearson coefficient between the human evaluation scores and the GPT-4 scores. For the single-mode evaluation, we adopt a cross-validation approach to ensure that each answer is scored by at least three people who are all experienced operation and maintenance engineers, and in the end, we take the average score as the human score. The Pearson coefficient is 0.78 and P-Value is 0.065. Generally, when the coefficient is greater than 0.7, it is usually considered to be a strong correlation. The detailed average scores are below:\n\n|  | LLaMA2-13b  |  ChatGLM-6b  | ChatGLM2-6b  | Qwen-7b  | InternLM-7b | OWL-13b |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Human average  score  | 7.61 | 7.65 | 7.52 | 7.81 | 7.33 | 8.09 |\n| GPT4 average score | 8.57    \u00a0 | 8.12 | 8.27 | 8.41 | 8.19 | 8.86 |\n\nFor pairwise-mode scoring, we use the results from GPT-4 evaluation as a reference for the evaluators. We also adopt a cross-validation approach to ensure that at least three people check each comparison result. If the GPT-4 score is incorrect, annotators must provide a new comparison result and give reasons; if all annotators agree that there is no issue with the scoring result of a particular question, then that result is kept. For inconsistent scoring results, we engage in further discussion and apply a majority vote system. The human scoring results are shown below and the Pearson correlation coefficient for the win rate is 0.97.\n\n**GPT4 result\uff1a**\n\n| model | win | loss | tie | win_rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Owl.vs.LLaMAv2-13b | 74 | 38 | 205 | 0.23 |\n| Owl.vs.Qwen-7b | 81 | 30 | 206 | 0.26 |\n| Owl.vs.ChatGLMv2-6b | 82 | 21 | 214 | 0.26 |\n| Owl.vs.ChatGLM-6b | 94 | 26 | 197 | 0.30 |\n| Owl.vs.InternLM-7b | 99 | 19 | 199 | 0.31 |\n\n**Result after manual review\uff1a**\n\n| model | win | loss | tie | win_rate |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Owl.vs.LLaMAv2-13b | 79 | 35 | 203 | 0.25 |\n| Owl.vs.Qwen-7b | 83 | 26 | 208 | 0.26 |\n| Owl.vs.ChatGLMv2-6b | 85 | 23 | 209 | 0.27 |\n| Owl.vs.ChatGLM-6b | 99 | 27 | 191 | 0.31 |\n| Owl.vs.InternLM-7b | 105 | 20 | 192 | 0.33 |\n\nReference:\n\n[5] https://mattilyra.github.io/2017/05/23/document-deduplication-with-lsh.html\n\n[6] https://github.com/ekzhu/datasketch\n\n---\n\nThank you once again for your insightful feedback.

Can OWL improve or solve specific challenges that traditional models can't handle in downstream tasks?\n3. In downstream tasks, OWL shows a smaller performance advantage compared to LogPrompt based on the open-domain ChatGPT. As a domain-specific model, can OWL be proven to have better output consistency and robustness than open-domain models like ChatGPT or GPT-4?"

Attempts to employ prompt engineering as a means to infuse expert knowledge into LLMs and steer them toward providing solutions have yielded inconsistent and suboptimal outcomes. This has led to a collective agreement on the necessity of constructing large-scale models that are intricately tailored to specific vertical domains, ensuring a higher degree of precision and effectiveness in their performance[1][2]. The development of our model first represents a dedicated endeavor tailored to the nuances of IT operations and maintenance (O&M) in specific domains. It is the culmination of meticulous expertise and specialized knowledge. The data that fuels this innovation is of immense value\u2014our carefully curated fine-tuned dataset, along with the benchmark data, is a testament to the labor-intensive process of manual labeling and collection, achieved without the crutch of data augmentation techniques. Besides, our approach are generalizable and can be easily migrated to other fields. The originality and ingenuity of our approach have not gone unnoticed, garnering acclaim from our peers in the field.

This can help operation and maintenance personnel better analyze and observe the system. In addition, traditional models require a large amount of labeled data and retraining to solve specific scenario problems, while OWL does not require more training and performs better in zero-shot scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of OWL with results on more downstream tasks.\n\nWe select a new downstream task for a more complex scenario test, Trace-Log Anomaly Detection, which is similar to a log anomaly detection task. This task uses two types of data, logs, and traces, for system anomaly detection and fault localization. We align with the experimental setup of DeepTraLog [1] and adopt the same dataset, TrainTicket[2]. In the experiments, we input the two types of mixed data directly into OWL, allowing the model to determine on its own whether there is an anomaly. The results comparison show the effect of OWL on such fault localization analysis:\n\n| Approach | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| TraceAnomaly [3]    | 0.742 | 0.205 | 0.321 |\n| MultimodalTrace [4] | 0.591  |  0.776 | 0.671 |\n| DeepTraLog [1] | 0.930   | 0.978 | 0.954 |\n| OWL | 0.961 | 0.985 | 0.973 |\n\nReference:\n\n[1] DeepTraLog: Trace-Log Combined Microservice Anomaly Detection through Graph-based Deep Learning\n\n[2] Fault Analysis and Debugging of Microservice Systems: Industrial Survey, Benchmark System, and Empirical Study\n\n[3] Unsupervised Detection of Microservice Trace Anomalies through Service-Level Deep Bayesian Networks\n\n[4]  Anomaly Detection from System Tracing Data Using Multimodal Deep Learning\n\n---\n\nThank you once again for your insightful feedback.

The dataset is rooted in some manually labeled data from domain experts which are enriched in a Self-Instruct fashion with supplementary samples. The Owl-Bench benchmark is another contribution of this work derived from real-world questions."

Attempts to employ prompt engineering as a means to infuse expert knowledge into LLMs and steer them toward providing solutions have yielded inconsistent and suboptimal outcomes. This has led to a collective agreement on the necessity of constructing large-scale models that are intricately tailored to specific vertical domains, ensuring a higher degree of precision and effectiveness in their performance[1][2]. The development of our model first represents a dedicated endeavor tailored to the nuances of IT operations and maintenance (O&M) in specific domains. It is the culmination of meticulous expertise and specialized knowledge. The data that fuels this innovation is of immense value\u2014our carefully curated fine-tuned dataset, along with the benchmark data, is a testament to the labor-intensive process of manual labeling and collection, achieved without the crutch of data augmentation techniques. Besides, our approach is generalizable and can be easily migrated to other fields. The originality and ingenuity of our approach have not gone unnoticed, garnering acclaim from our peers in the field. \n\nReference:\n\n[1] https://github.com/luban-agi/Awesome-Domain-LLM\n\n[2] BloombergGPT: A Large Language Model for Finance"

For the single-mode evaluation, we adopt a cross-validation approach to ensure that each answer is scored by at least three people who are all experienced operation and maintenance engineers, and in the end, we take the average score as the human score. The Pearson coefficient is 0.78 and P-Value is 0.065. Generally, when the coefficient is greater than 0.7, it is usually considered to be a strong correlation. The detailed average scores are below:\n\n|  | LLaMA2-13b  |  ChatGLM-6b  | ChatGLM2-6b  | Qwen-7b  | InternLM-7b | OWL-13b |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Human average  score  | 7.61 | 7.65 | 7.52 | 7.81 | 7.33 | 8.09 |\n| GPT4 average score | 8.57    \u00a0 | 8.12 | 8.27 | 8.41 | 8.19 | 8.86 |\n\nFor pairwise-mode scoring, we use the results from GPT-4 evaluation as a reference for the evaluators. We also adopt a cross-validation approach to ensure that at least three people check each comparison result. If the GPT-4 score is incorrect, annotators must provide a new comparison result and give reasons; if all annotators agree that there is no issue with the scoring result of a particular question, then that result is kept. For inconsistent scoring results, we engage in further discussion and apply a majority vote system.
