It argues that by using this equivalence, a new family of algorithms can be derived for solving imperfect information games that do not reply on public information. This makes the algorithms more efficient and more suitable for games where most information is non-public. The authors further tested the proposed approach in the Hanabi game, and demonstrated the advantage of the approach."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their review.\n\n> What are the objectives of the algorithms (global policy learners and DTP algorithms)?\n\nThe definitions of these classes of algorithms (global policy learners and DTP algorithms) specify the structure of the updates they induce, not their objectives. For global policy learners, the update is over the whole policy at once, whereas for DTP planning algorithms, it is only over a single decision-point.\n\n> Do they compute an equilibrium of the game\n\nWhether or not a global policy learner or DTP algorithm computes an equilibrium of the game depends on the algorithm and the game. For example, counterfactual regret minimization and policy gradient can both be considered as global policy learners. However, while counterfactual regret minimization computes equilibria in two-player zero-sum games, policy gradient does not (though it sometimes still performs well in practice).\n\n> do they just compute policies for the next iteration?\n\nGlobal policy learners compute policies for the next iteration. Decision-time planning algorithms compute policies for the current decision point.\n\n> What is the solution concept applied for the games studied?\n\nSolution concepts aren't necessarily the best way of thinking about the submission's framework in generality. The submission shows that decision-time planning algorithms can inherit the one-step guarantees of global algorithms. These guarantees can be related to solution concepts, but don't have to be. Of the algorithms studied in the experiments section, MD-UES possesses a guarantee on expected return improvement, while the results of Sokota et al. (2023) suggest that MMD-UES may possess guarantees related a decrease in exploitability. These guarantees are related to Nash equilibria in the sense that Nash equilibria are fixed points of the updates. However, at decision-time, we are only doing one-step improvements (and therefore not converging arbitrarily close to equilibria).\n\n> What does $g$ represent when you introduce the global policy learners?\n\nAs is defined in Section 2, $g$ just represents the game itself (i.e., the states, actions, transition function, reward functions, etc.).\n\n> $\\pi_i$ is initially defined as the policy of player $i$, but when you introduce the global policy learners, $\\pi_t$ seems to be associated with a time step $t$, so what does $\\pi_t$ refer to here?\n\nThanks for pointing this out. $\\pi_t$ refers to the joint policy at time $t$. We changed $\\pi_t$ to $\\pi^t$ in the text to clarify this issue.\n\n> Is there an iterative updating process where a new policy is used in each time step $t$?\n\nYes, as is defined by the update function of a global policy learner update function in the text:\n$\\mathcal{U}^{\\text{global}} \\colon (\\pi_t, g) \\mapsto \\pi_{t+1}$.\n\n> Do you mean that there is a further randomization over the output distribution (i.e., a distribution over $\\mathbb{A}_i$ is randomly chosen)?\n\nYes.\n\n> What is $\\mathcal{P}_{\\pi}$ in Algorithm 1? It seems undefined.\n\nThanks for pointing this out. $\\mathcal{P}_{\\pi}(h)$ is the probability of reaching history $h$ using joint policy $\\pi$. We added this to the notation in Section 2 to clarify this issue.\n\n> What is $G$ samples in the algorithm?\n\n$G$ is the return, as is stated in the pseudocode text. We added this to the notation in Section 2 to clarify this issue."

To address this issue, this paper introduces a framework for decision-time planning, focusing on the idea of update equivalence rather than subgames. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms, when applied to Hanabi, 3x3 Abrupt Dark Hex, and Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe, either match or surpass state-of-the-art methods."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their review.\n\n> I find the proposed methods to be somewhat straightforward and intuitive\n\nWe are happy to hear that the reviewer finds the method straightforward and intuitive. However, that these methods are straightforward and intuitive are a strengh, not a weakness. It is important to appreciate once again that these methods outperform existing state-of-the-art methods for Hanabi, which are both much more complicated and much more expensive. So, pointing out that straightforward and intuitive methods are superior to involved constructions is an important observation for the literature (in our opinion).\n\n> I would encourage the authors to highlight the novelty and distinctiveness of their approach.\n\nThe novelty is our recognition of the fact that update equivalence can justify principled decision-time planning algorithms in imperfect information games (indeed, no existing work recognized this fact!). As we state in the abstract: \"Despite its conceptual simplicity, this approach had surprisingly been overlooked in the imperfect-information game literature.\" As a result of this novel recognition, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a competitive search benchmark with approaches far simpler and far less expensive than the previous state-of-the-art.\n\nPlease let us know if we missed any opportunity to make this clear in the submission.\n\n> The theoretical results, such as Theorem 3.3, appear to be relatively basic and directly inferred from standard findings.\n\nThe results ought not to be judged based on the difficulty of the proof but rather whether the result itself is important. Theorem 3.3 gives provable justification for update equivalence-based search in Dec-POMDPs. This allowed us to achieve a new state-of-the-art for Hanabi, which is the most competitive search benchmark for Dec-POMDPs.\n\n> Additionally, these results do not provide a comprehensive characterization of global convergence.\n\nThis criticism could be applied to almost all literature on search in imperfect information games, so we do not feel that it is really a weakness.\n\n> In terms of the empirical evaluation, I have reservations about the performance of the proposed methods, as they don't appear to offer a substantial improvement over existing algorithms.\n\nAs articulated in the submission, **the empirical results on Hanabi are very strong**. On 5-card Hanabi, we achieve comparable results to the existing SOTA with **two orders of magnitude** less search budget and an approximate belief (when we told an expert in Hanabi literature about these results, their initial reaction was that we must have a bug because the results seemed too good to be true). On 7-card Hanabi, we substantially outperform all existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art. We also show substantial improvement in imperfect-information settings in which public belief state-based methods are not even applicable.\n\n> To strengthen the paper, it would be advantageous for the authors to broaden the scope of their evaluation, encompassing more complex scenarios.\n\nHanabi is both highly complex and the most well-benchmarked setting for search in large-scale Dec-POMDPs. There are multiple papers in literature that exclusively benchmark search results on Hanabi:\n- Improving Policies via Search in Cooperative Partially Observable Games (AAAI)\n- Scalable Online Planning via Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (NeurIPS)\n- A Fine-Tuning Approach to Belief State Modeling (ICLR)\n\nCompared to these (published) works, we encompass a much wider variety of settings by also including adversarial settings.\n\n---\n\nPlease let us know whether these answers have resolved the reviewer's concerns. If so, we would appreciate the reviewer considering the possibility of revising their assessment."

However, it is unclear how could Algorithm 1 converts a global policy learner to a decision-time planner, as claimed in the paper.\n\nAlgorithm 1 is a decision-time planning algorithm (by construction) and takes the local update function of a global policy learner $\\mathcal{U}_Q^{\\text{global}}$ as input (by construction).\n\n> What does it mean by policy iteration local updating function?\n\nWe don't use the term \"policy iteration local updating function\" in the submission. We do use the term \"policy iteration's local update function\". This is defined in the text: \n\"The local update induced by policy iteration can be written as $U_Q^{\\text{global}} \\colon (\\bar{\\pi}, \\bar{q}) \\mapsto \\sigma$ where $\\Sigma_{a \\in \\text{arg max } \\bar{q}} \\sigma(a) = 1$, where $\\bar{\\pi}$ and $\\bar{q}$ refer to generic elements of $\\Delta(\\mathbb{A}_i)$ and $\\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathbb{A}_i|}$, respectively.\"\n\n> How to plug it into Algorithm 1?\n\n$U^{\\text{global}}_Q$ is applied on the final line of the pseudocode, as is written in the text.\n\n> Why it can turn the algorithm to Monte Carlo search?\n\nAs is discussed in the text, Algorithm 1, given policy iteration's $U^{\\text{global}}_Q$, coincides with Monte Carlo search. Both estimate action values using rollouts and select an action with a maximal action value.\n\n> how to integrate the constraint on $\\sigma$?\n\nThere is no constraint on $\\sigma$ that requires integration. It is just a distribution over the maximally valued actions.\n\n> Does Proposition 3.2 rely on the definition of global policy learner operating with action-value feedback?\n\nYes, because Proposition 3.2 makes is a statement about global policy learners operating with action-value feedback it is inherently tied to the definition of global policy learners operating with action-value feedback.\n\n> How to guarantee the desired connection between $\\mathcal{U}^{\\text{global}}$ and $\\mathcal{U}^{\\text{global}}_Q$ exist, and if so, how to obtain the corresponding function?\n\nThere is no such guarantee. The reviewer may misunderstand the purpose of this connection. It's not to show this connection exists for every $\\mathcal{U}^{\\text{global}}$ (it doesn't); it's to exploit this connection for specific $\\mathcal{U}^{\\text{global}}$ for which the connection does exist. For example, the desired connection exists for mirror descent and magnetic mirror descent, which allowed us to derive the search algorithms stuied in the paper."

In search literature, it is common to say \"until search budget is exhausted\" to mean \"do search for as long as is convenient\". There is no requirement to fully exhaust any particular budget. Indeed, the class of algorithms we empirically investigate fall under the class \"anytime algorithms\" which is a term that means that they can be stopped at any time.\n\n> I would prefer a separate \"related works\" section to make the presentation more clear.\n\nTo clarify, there is already a separate related works section (Section 5) with about a page of content.\n\n> How does the proposed framework of update equivalence fundamentally differ from the traditional subgame-based approach in DTP? \n\nConceptually they can be seen as doing two different things. Subgame-based approaches define an auxiliary game and try to solve that game as best as possible. Update equivalence approaches try to approximate a pre-defined update step.\n\nAn advantage of subgame-based approaches is that one can sometimes achieve a larger improvement by solving the entire subgame than would be possible by performing a single update step. An advantage of update equivalence-based approaches is that can you sidestep the need to construct a subgame, which can be expensive or intractable in imperfect information settings. For example, even in 7-card Hanabi, it becomes very difficult to employ public belief state-based methods because the public belief state is too large to compute exactly."
