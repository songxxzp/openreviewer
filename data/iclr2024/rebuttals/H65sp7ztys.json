It highlights the importance of data augmentations in enhancing OOD detection by diversifying features. While prior research has primarily focused on data augmentation during the training phase, this paper presents the first in-depth exploration of test-time augmentation (TTA) and its impact on OOD detection. The study reveals that aggressive TTAs can cause distribution shifts in OOD scores of In-distribution (InD) data, while mild TTAs do not, showcasing the effectiveness of mild TTAs in OOD detection."

There is a lack of consideration of the model architecture's influence; the paper only focuses on one model architecture for each scenario. Table 7 does not compare with existing works. Existing research [3] shows that the choice of model architecture has a significant impact on the performance of detection algorithms. It is essential to compare different algorithms across several models, rather than limiting the comparison to just one model.\n\nI actually enjoyed reading this paper. If the authors can provide reasonable explanations for these issues, I am inclined to increase the score.\n\n[1] Huang R, Geng A, Li Y.

For example, rotation for tubular \u2013rotationally invariant \u2013 objects may have no effect. However, the same can be a difficult augmentation for various upright objects such as animals, cars, humans etc. \n\nThe augmentation is mostly cropping. Is there any guarantee that it generalizes to other domains like text, medical, etc.  The performance on texture recognition shows the limitation of the method.  I appreciate that the authors accept it as a limitation of the work. The solution is clean and effective, but the design of the solution makes the scope of this very narrow. \n\nNo theoretical justification is provided."

Then moving to Section 2, it is even more confusing. Without any definition of what the \"OOD Score\" is, the authors show figures and tables that use the \"OOD Score\" as the metric.\n\n2) More deeper explanations are needed for \"why IDA is good for OOD detection\" as this is the foundation of this proposed method. Currently, the authors only show two images, is it true for other images (images from different classes or other images such as medical imaging or grayscale images)?\n\n3) The \"Method\" part is also very weak and ambiguous. For example, the \"design objective\": \"This work considers the classifiers...\" It sounds like the goal is to build a robust classifier that could be robust to different kinds of corruption. I think more careful description and more detailed explanations are needed for the \"Method\" part.\n\n4) It is also not clear what the authors mean by \"Test Time\". Either from the problem setting up, the method, or from the experiments, it is not clear. I think the authors should make this term more clear. Do we need access to the original training dataset? Is it under an unsupervised setting or a supervised setting?\n\n5) What is the dimension of the embedding space? Will it affect the performance? Also, what is the computational overhead of the proposed KNN-based method compared to other methods?"
