In particular:\n1. Our environments use a number of different objects for the manipulation setting\n2. We use two different types of robot arms - a Franka Emika and a WidowX, as well as an A1 quadruped robot. \n3. The tasks we consider are more complex and involve achieving multiple objectives (i.e. arranging multiple objects in a scene).\n4. Furthermore, our tasks have a number of continuous distribution shifts, such as scene, texture and camera randomization. \n5. Moreover we have collected over 20 hours of realistic human manipulation data beyond pure expert demonstrations, such as play, failures, and sub-optimal execution, which was not analyzed by RoboMimic. \n\nThank you for bringing RL-ViGen to our attention. We view this work as complementary to ours, since our manipulation environments do not overlap. \n\n1. We aimed to create a lightweight and accessible benchmark for data-centric RL, which does not involve heavy simulators, such as CARLA and Habitat. \n2. Our proposed environments have naturally occurring distribution shifts, such as diverse objects, visuals, lighting and camera angles, while the ones in RL-ViGen are rather artificial.\n3. We also aimed to utilize realistic human-collected datasets, rather than replay-buffer based ones.\n\n**Possibly unfeasible settings. As shown by evaluation results, most SOTA algorithms are not working well on this benchmark. This could possibly be attributed to the difficulties of the task, but from my perspective, there could also be some key factors that are not right, such as the problem formulation and the framework of offline RL. (This point might be not significant, but it is my personal concern about the benchmark.)**\n\nWe have included improved results on some of the tasks, achieved by a more extensive hyper-parameter search (see table below). The fact that SoTA RL methods achieve good performance on other benchmarks (such as D4RL) but do not achieve good performance on our benchmark is echoed by results on many real world robot manipulation tasks, in which behavior-cloning based methods tend to out-perform current RL methods. We hope that our benchmark can drive the development of RL methods which are more successful in real robot applications. For example, a recent model-based RL method [1] is able to fully solve the Standard Franka Kitchen from images with online fine-tuning. \n\n| Task Name         | BC    | DDPM + BC | IQL   | IDQL  | CQL | TD3 + BC |\n|-------------------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|-----|----------|\n| Sorting           | 32.54 | 28.47     | 33.56 | 35.59 | 0   | 14.24    |\n| Sorting Bin Noise | 44.75 | 34.58     | 45.76 | 49.49 | 0   | 21.36    |\n\n\n[1] MOTO: Offline Pre-training to Online Fine-tuning for Model-based Robot Learning \nRafael Rafailov, et. al, Conference on Robot Learning, 2023\n\n**Overclaim of the paper title.

The main ones being:\n1. Focusing on realistic robotic tasks versus simple simulated embodiments.\n2. Learning from realistic observation spaces rather than ground-truth states.\n3. We introduced a significant amount of diversity in terms of objects to manipulate (which require different grasps) and visual environments.\n4. We introduced a number of new realistic human-collected datasets, such as undirected manipulation and sub-optimal execution data, rather than using RL replay buffers."

We have added some updated results to improve the performance on the WidowX task (see Table below), one of these challenging tasks that are referred to. \nTo increase task performance, we refactored the environment by modifying the layout of the environment, the tractability of grasping objects in the scene and collecting longer demos:\n\n- **Augmenting the layout of the environment** so that there is more room to grasp the objects found in the center of the scene\n\n- **Reducing the range of the rotation of objects and the size of objects in the scene** to increase grasp success (as the simulated robot doesn\u2019t have a rotation in gripper space)\n\n- **Collecting for a longer horizon** to ensure that the full sorting procedure occurs for the scripted sorting policy for each episode collected.\n\n| Task Name         | BC    | DDPM + BC | IQL   | IDQL  | CQL | TD3 + BC |\n|-------------------|-------|-----------|-------|-------|-----|----------|\n| Sorting           | 32.54 | 28.47     | 33.56 | 35.59 | 0   | 14.24    |\n| Sorting Bin Noise | 44.75 | 34.58     | 45.76 | 49.49 | 0   | 21.36    |\n\nWe have refactored the tasks to be (1) sorting, where the agent has to sort two objects into their respective bins and (2) sorting bin noise, where the agent still has to sort the two objects but there is a probability that each object is placed into the wrong bin.\nAlong with this modified task, we have included the performance of a random policy on our tasks, which achieves a 0% success rate across all tasks.\n\n**The paper is currently lacking ablation studies to understand what components of the benchmark are challenging and/or why current algorithms fail.**\n\nWhile we do not have ablation studies of the current RL methods, since our goal is not to develop better RL methods but rather to provide a benchmark, the benchmark tasks themselves are already designed to provide different difficulty tiers, and therefore can help researchers understand where their methods work better or worse. This was already discussed to some degree in Section 4, but we have since expanded that discussion.\nSpecifically, the Standard and Randomized Kitchen environments evaluate the ability of methods to learn to compose multiple manipulation tasks over a long time horizon. The Randomized Kitchen environment additionally tests the visual robustness of methods and their ability to generalize to variations in object shape and location. The play dataset of the Randomized kitchen tests the ability of methods to learn from sub-optimal (non-demonstration quality) data. \n\n**I would like to see a random policy as a simple baseline. I wonder if the benchmarked methods even do better than a random policy.**\n\n\nRandom policies achieve zero success on our manipulation environments. We have added the result to the experiment table. \n\n\n**Why is there such a big gap between IQL and other similar methods such as CQL and TD3+BC? These methods often perform very similarly in D4RL, at least in the locomotion tasks.**\n\nThe fact that value-based RL methods perform worse than behavior cloning-based methods on our benchmark is an important insight/contribution, not a disadvantage. In many real robot manipulation tasks, behavior cloning-based methods tend to outperform offline value-based-RL methods, too. While value-based RL methods have achieved SoTA performance on simpler benchmarks, such as D4RL, we hope that our benchmark can help drive the development of offline RL methods that perform well on more realistic robot manipulation tasks \n\n**Section 5.2 states that the goal of the Frank Kitchen environment is to study offline RL and online fine-tuning, but the following text does not mention how the proposed task facilitates online finetuning.**\n\nAs far as we are aware no current method can solve the environment fully with only the provided offline data. Because of this, additional online fine-tuning is a necessary step to be able to learn to fully solve it. We hope that our benchmark can provide a good way to evaluate methods for offline-to-online fine-tuning, where the available offline data is insufficient to fully solve a task, but can provide a good starting off point for initializing a policy for online learning. We carry online fine-tuning experiments on a number of our environments, results are shown in Table 2."

Evaluating temporal compositionality seems possible using previous benchmarks (D4RL Maze2D, AntMaze, FrankaKitchen-Mixed, Calvin).**\n\nWe agree that these environments test temporal compositionality to some degree.

While the existing Franka and Calvin environments still pose a challenge, they do not test other scenarios, such as the multimodality of the data distribution (Franka kitchen is composed entirely of demonstration data, and CALVIN is composed entirely of play data). In our \u201cplay\u201d datasets tasks can be executed partially and in arbitrary order and the agent needs to learn how to compose these together, which proves to be quite challenging. \n\n**The proposed benchmark has less diversity than D4RL, and different levels of data distribution are also discussed in D4RL.**\n\nIn this proposed benchmark we focus on realistic robotics tasks. While it is true that D4RL considered different levels of data quality, it did so by using different parts of an online RL replay buffer.

As far as we are aware at the time of submission no offline RL or online fine-tuning approach had fully solved even the fully observable low-dimensional state versions.
