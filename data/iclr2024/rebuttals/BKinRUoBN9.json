                        "value": "**Response to Weakness 1:**\nThank you for your careful review of our paper and valuable suggestions. We highly appreciate your feedback and have made adjustments to the paper structure based on your recommendations.\n\nUnder your guidance, we have optimized the paper to ensure a better organizational structure and emphasis on content. Specifically, we have moved some detailed derivations to the appendix, freeing up more space in the main text for experiments and analysis (see the revised version). This adjustment aims to enhance the readability and focus of the paper, ensuring that readers can more directly access experimental results and relevant analyses.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\nThank you for your review and valuable feedback. We appreciate your concerns and would like to further clarify the intent and contributions of our research.\n\nFirstly, we want to emphasize that the primary goal of our study is to explore the impact of data distribution shifts on cross-modal knowledge distillation, Specifically, the introduction of perceptual divergence distillation loss aims to eliminate inconsistent predictions in the solution space through masking, thereby validating the content of our proposed hypothesis. We observed a substantial increase in our PSSM distillation loss with larger differences in input data distribution, indicating that the inconsistency in the solution space caused by data distribution differences can lead to the failure of cross-modal knowledge distillation. We have expanded the discussion on this aspect in therevised version , and specific details can be found in *Appendix B.2* in the updated paper.\n\nSecondly, we acknowledge that the practical application contributions of our method are relatively limited, and our focus leans more towards theoretical research. We will consider future directions for our work to comprehensively address practical applications and strive to provide more practical solutions for real-world scenarios.\n\nIn summary, our work is oriented towards validating specific hypotheses and making theoretical contributions. Once again, thank you for your suggestions and the time you dedicated to the review. We will make every effort to improve and meet your expectations.\n\n**Response to Weakness 3:**\nThank you for your valuable feedback. To better illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed enhanced cross-modal knowledge distillation method, we have made the following additions:\n\nOn the sklearn dataset, we conducted additional analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, through experiments, we can elucidate that the efficacy of the PSSM method lies in its capability to induce consistency in the solution space of the \"Target\" section, while preserving the distinctiveness of the solution space for the \"Non-target\" section. For specific details, please refer to Appendix B.2 in the updated paper.\nWe trust that these supplemental experiments provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of our approach. Your insightful suggestions have significantly contributed to the refinement of our work.\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\nThank you for your valuable feedback. We have revised all the figures by using the vector graphics to make it clear when zoomed in. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the initial lack of clarity in the pictures. We look forward to your improved experience with the updated image quality.\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\nThank you for your feedback. We have carefully reviewed and corrected spelling errors in the paper, such as \"modaalities\" . We apologize for any inconvenience caused by these errors. We hope these corrections enhance the quality of the paper."

                        "value": "**Response to Weakness 1:**\nI extend my sincere appreciation for your invaluable feedback.\n\nConcerning our proposed Perceptual Solution Space Mask (PSSM), it is imperative to emphasize its principal objective, which involves the introduction of a perceptual divergence distillation loss to rectify inconsistent predictions within the solution space through the application of masking. It is essential to clarify that our objective is not primarily focused on presenting a highly innovative knowledge distillation method; instead, it is directed towards substantiating our hypothesis concerning solution space divergence.\n\nAs elucidated in the revised paper (Appendix B.2 in the updated paper.), we observe a significant increase in the PSSM distillation loss when confronted with more substantial disparities in input data distribution. Conversely, the degree of enhancement is marginal or even diminishing when faced with minor discrepancies in data distribution. This observation signifies that the incongruity in the solution space, stemming from differences in data distribution, is a pivotal factor contributing to the inefficacy of crossmodal knowledge distillation.\n\nFurther elaboration on our research contributions and motivations is provided in Section 1 of the paper, underscoring the central theme of our investigation encapsulated in the paper's title: \"Investigating the Impact of Data Distribution Shifts on Crossmodal Knowledge Distillation.\"\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my gratitude for your constructive feedback. Your insightful suggestions have significantly enriched the overall quality of the paper.\n\n**Response to Weakness 2:**\nI appreciate your valuable feedback.\n\nWe have addressed and incorporated your suggestions, including conducting comparative experiments with five classic single-modal knowledge distillation methods.\nResults demonstrate that, as data distribution differences increase, none of the single-modal methods exhibit effective performance, affirming the universal impact of data shift on cross-modal knowledge distillation.\n\nSpecific comparative results are presented in **Tables 8, 9, and 10** for your reference, offering a comprehensive view of our method's performance amidst data distribution differences and emphasizing the persistent challenge in traditional single-modal methods. We have added these experiments on **Page 17-18** in the revised version.\n\nThank you once again for your insightful feedback, contributing significantly to the paper's improvement."

                        "value": "**Response to Weakness :**\nWe sincerely apologize for any confusion caused by inaccuracies in our expression. Typically, neural network parameters represent the solution space. However, in our paper, we establish a connection between changes in data distribution (specifically, modal differences) and the \"solution space\" based on the provided assumptions 1 and 2. Specifically, under the conditions of assumptions 1 and 2, the only distinction between cross-modal knowledge distillation and single-modal knowledge distillation is the difference in data distribution. Thus, we can replace the solution space, originally represented by network parameters, with the output probability distribution after inputting the data into the network. In summary, this connection is often invalid without the prerequisites of the first two assumptions.\n\nFinally, we have revised and refined the expressions related to this section in the paper, making it more rigorous. For detailed information, please **refer to the updatedversion, specifically page 4**. We appreciate once again the constructive feedback you provided, which played a crucial role in enhancing the quality of the paper.\n\n\n**Response to Question 1:**\nThank you for your meticulous review.We have revised it in the revised version.\n\n**Response to Question 2:**\nThank you for your attention to the details of our paper.\n\nWe chose the cosine similarity function for the following reasons:\n\n(1). **Necessity of Relative Distance:** In comparison to other distance metrics such as JS distance and Euclidean distance, which typically have an infinite range, our PSSM method requires setting thresholds based on distribution distances within a finite range. Therefore, we opted for cosine similarity rather than absolute distance to characterize distribution differences.\n\n(2). **Advantages of Cosine Similarity:** The range of cosine similarity is easily scaled between 0 and 1, allowing us to quantify distribution differences on a relative and standardized scale. Specifically, when cosine similarity is 0, it indicates no distribution difference, and when it is 1, it signifies maximum distribution difference. This enables us to comprehend and measure cross-modal data distribution differences more clearly.\n\nConsidering these two reasons, we chose the cosine similarity function.\n\n**Response to Question 3**\nThe reason we did not use \"input noisy MNIST to student and use MNIST-M for teacher\" is that, with the introduction of noise, the teacher's accuracy would sharply decline, while the student network's accuracy would remain high. In this scenario, the student would not effectively acquire knowledge from the teacher. To address your inquiry, we conducted additional experiments by employing noisy MNIST as input for the student network and MNIST-M as input for the teacher network. The results are shown in the table below:\n\n| Noise Level | Teacher Accuracy | Student w/o KD | Student KD DKD | Student KD DKD with PSSM |\n|:------------:|:----------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:------------------------:|\n| 0            | 74.87           | 92.98           | 88.46 (-4.52 \u00b1 0.18) | **92.15** (-0.83 \u00b1 0.38)      |\n| 1            | 37.77           | 92.98           | 70.28 (-22.70 \u00b1 7.20) | **90.02** (-2.96 \u00b1 2.00)  |\n| 2            | 19.77           | 92.98            | 70.87 (-22.14 \u00b1 7.31) | **79.28** (-13.70 \u00b1 0.80) |\n| 3            | 15.11            | 92.98            |67.52 (-25.96 \u00b1 5.46) | **77.67** (-15.31 \u00b1 4.03) |\n| 4            | 12.42            | 92.98            |71.36 (-21.62 \u00b1 0.80) | **74.86** (-18.12 \u00b1 4.29) |\n| 5            | 11.36            | 92.98            |64.36 (-28.62 \u00b1 2.90) | **72.86** (-20.12 \u00b1 3.49) |"

First, the hypothesis of solution space divergence (SPDH) is introduced to show that the success in cross-modal KD is decided by the data distribution shift. Then an effective method called PSSM (perceptual solution space mask) is proposed to enhance cross-modal KD. Experimental results on four popular datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed hypothesis and method."

Both SSDH and PSSM are instructive.\n\n**Quality**: The paper provides extensive experimental evaluations of the proposed hypothesis and method. \n\n**Clarity**: The paper also provides sufficient background information and related work to situate the contribution of the proposed hypothesis and method in the context of existing literature on cross-modal KD, KD analysis, and distribution shifts.\n\n**Significance**: The paper has established the conditions under which cross-modal KD outperforms unimodal scenarios.
