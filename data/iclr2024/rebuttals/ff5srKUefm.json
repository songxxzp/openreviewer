                    "value": "The authors view capsule neural network (henceforth ConvNets) routing through the lenses of information theory. They propose a non-iterative routing mechanism based on entropy that deals with the voting process. Despite having some nice properties (it is non-iterative for one) it does not seem to actually work well in practice, at least not with respect to other methods that have been proposed since dynamic routing was proposed back in 2017. \\\nI do not think that SOTA is or should be the main criterion but the lack of performance overall might point to an inefficient routing mechanism with respect to how lower and higher capsules are learned and routed through."

By that I mean that if the authors present a more in depth analysis, perhaps through visualisations and capsule activations, of what is taking place when routing with entropy, it might provide some insights as to how future Capsnet models could be improved to the point of surpassing current models."

For instance, other papers have used attention to capture local features and local-global context, or leveraged pruning to reduce parameters etc. What does entropy offer to how the part-whole relationships are learned?\n2) Any insights into why performance lags with respect to pretty much most of the more recent papers? Is there anything fundamental that hinders that and/or does this imply that entropy might not be the way forward?"

We chose to not tweak our model to each dataset or use an ensemble because we were interested in exploring the generalization ability of our approach in order to investigate the potential of capsules as-is. That is also why we deem it important to measure the performance of capsule networks without data augmentation.\n\nThis unfortunately produces incomplete work. Multiple models should be tested to validate your hypothesis. Cutting it short here is not persuasive."
