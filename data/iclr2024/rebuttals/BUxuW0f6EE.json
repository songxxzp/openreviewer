                    "value": "The authors study electric vehicle (EV) usage patterns in the pursuit of providing insights for better battery lifecycle management. Specifically, the authors study an EV dataset consisting of 3,100 vehicles and 3.8 million sample readings each comprised of 5 different measurements such as the timestamp, odometer reading, and state of charge percentage (SOC %). The authors introduce a two-stage cascaded clustering technique to group the data into semantic usage-pattern clusters. Stage 1 consists of applying either K-means, K-medoids, or agglomerative clustering, while stage 2 uses a long short-term memory (LSTM) network in combination with a graph convolution network (GCN) to achieve embeddings that further refine the semantic clusters."

The insights obtained from using the proposed methodology seem limited, and I'm uncertain of their value (Figure 4). I think a human evaluation of the identified clusters from domain experts would greatly strengthen the experimental evaluation section and any claims about improved insights made in the paper.\n\n* The clarity of the paper could be greatly improved. For example, it's unclear to me how the data is collected; did the authors collect this data themselves, or is this a public dataset? Also, over what time frame does this dataset cover? What is the distribution of vehicle types in the dataset? Please see the \"Questions\" section for more details about clarity improvements.\n\n* The sample measurements from the vehicles follow a power law distribution, resulting in an experimental evaluation that only depends on a relatively small number of the overall number of vehicles.\n\n* Experiments are only performed using a single dataset, thus, it is unclear how robust these results are. An experimental evaluation using a wider range of datasets would greatly strengthen any generalizability claims made in the paper.\n\n* There are no error bars for the majority of the results (Tables 1, 2, and 3).\n\n* There are grammatical errors throughout the paper, consider using a service like Grammarly to fix these issues.\n\n* I'm unclear of the overall takeaway message of Figure 7, consider adding more clarifying text to the caption and labeling the x-axes in Figures 7a and 7b.\n\n* There is no empirical runtime evaluation of the proposed approach and competing baselines. This evaluation may be very beneficial to readers when deciding whether or not to the use the proposed methodology.\n\n* Figure 2b is not colorblind friendly."

                    "value": "The proposed work applies a graph-based clustering algorithm to segment different battery usage behaviors among EV users. While the study certainly has merits, I am concerned with the contributions of the study. As a study for the application of ML methods, I am not fully convinced of the practical importance of clustering EV drivers purely based on the timestamp and the SoC consumption, and how the obtained clustering insights could be used to promote social goods without location and contextual information. Moreover, the outcomes of the study are believed to be very sensitive to the feature engineering process that is problematic, which is mainly due to the quality of the data itself. Finally, the reviewer believes that for this type of application, the unique insights that are not easily obtainable through standard clustering approaches would be more important than the clustering quality quantified by the `Silhouette Score', especially when no ground truth information is available to validate what is the `optimal` number of clusters. The study currently does not include justifications on how the proposed method can uniquely extract important hidden information. The reviewer believes that the study is more suitable for publication in an interdisciplinary journal rather than ICRL."

                    "value": "The authors did not sufficiently defend their motivations and the reviewer is not convinced by the importance of the study.  Why is it important to cluster similar EV vehicles based on their battery consumption? What does this tell us? After reading through the paper, I still have a hard time connecting how such clustering would contribute to the grid management, without additional information on their location information. \n\nThe writing of the introduction section is also a bit disorganized. The authors started with existing efforts in clustering EV usage patterns and then suddenly jumped to GNNs in a completely different context. I did not find a strong reasoning as to why the proposed `cascading clustering` scheme is necessary for the proposed task. The current presentation left me with the impression that the author is trying to find nails with a hammer in hand. \n\nThe data used in this study is not of sufficient quality to support the aim of the authors, and the authors have to introduce predefined thresholds (feature engineering) to tell charging events from driving events and vehicles being idle. The introduced threshold (2% SOC change in 10 minutes) is problematic, and will likely count slow charging as driving events. Note that an hour of slow charging will yield a 1 kWh increase in SoC or equivalently ~2%, meaning that a slow charging, in this case, will provide fewer than 0.3% of SoC in 10 minutes. This point alone would totally destroy the outcomes of the study. \n\nThe results are more qualitative discussions that explain the contextual insights from the clustering outcomes. It would be more favorable if the results emphasized distinct insights that are only obtainable through the design of such a clustering algorithm and why such insights are important for practitioners."

In the second stage, based on these clusters, the authors use LSTM and GCN-based deep learning techniques for further analysis.  The two-stage method effectively extracts insights from temporal EV charging data, contributing to a deeper understanding of user charging profiles and behaviors. The method could potentially enhance EV system efficiency and personalization by considering the unique attributes of each identified cluster."
