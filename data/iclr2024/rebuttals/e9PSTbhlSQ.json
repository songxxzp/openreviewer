In learning while sleeping, the memory reactivation is similar to the replay-based methods, and the distribution generalization is similar to the regularization-based methods. \n\nFrom a neuroscience perspective to this reviewer\u2019s knowledge, learning during sleep is more related to the stimulus given before sleeping (memory reactivation); thus, it has nothing to do with a new stimulation (no sample from a new task is given). In this regard, this reviewer believes that the proposed LwS doesn\u2019t follow the neural mechanism. \n\nMany typos in the context and the equations make it challenging to read and understand the paper. Especially for the equations, please carefully check the super/subscripts."

How are the notations of $(\\theta_{t+1}^{*\u2019}, W_{t+1}^{*\u2019})$ and $(\\theta_{t+1}^{*}, W_{t+1}^{*})$ different? Especially the last sentence in Proof needs checking carefully, \u201c~, it follows that $H~~~ <= H~~~~$.\u201d \n\nIn Algorithm 1, $D_{0}$ is not defined.\n\nThe authors also need to provide the results of VCL and LwS on other datasets in task-IL and class-IL scenarios.\n\nIn Figure 2, the markers in the graphs and the legends do not match."

                        "value": "Thanks for your constructive comments and suggestions. We have carefully considered the feedback provided and decide to withdraw this manuscript. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for recognizing and acknowledging the novelty of our idea. \n\nAlthough each of our modifications aligns with the theoretical derivations and sleep mechanisms described in the paper, and differs in implementation from existing parameter regularization and feature distillation methods, we acknowledge that the innovativeness of our algorithmic changes may not be sufficiently apparent. There are two main reasons for this: first, integrating brain mechanisms into algorithmic improvements is a necessary but challenging task, so further exploration is required to establish a reasonable correspondence between brain mechanisms and specific algorithm designs. Second, the VCL algorithm itself is based on parameter regularization, which necessitates that our improvements build upon this foundation, making our method appear less novel. Therefore, in our future work, we will delve deeper into incorporating relevant brain mechanisms for more profound algorithmic enhancements to achieve superior performance.\n\nRegarding the second question you raised, it depends on the understanding of what the stimulus given before sleeping are. For instance, in a completely blank brain, after receiving stimuli on the first day, what is consolidated during the first night of sleep is solely the stimuli received on that first day. However, when sleeping on the night of the second day, the brain integrates stimuli from both the first and second days, rather than just the stimuli received on the second day (even though the proportion of stimuli received on the second day is higher). In our algorithm, we simulate this integration process by aligning parameters and features. Therefore, in our view, LwS follows the brain mechanisms.\n\nIf you are interested in this brain-inspired algorithm, we would be more than willing to discuss it with you after it becomes open for discussion.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate the invaluable feedback again, and we will make further modifications to the work based on these suggestions."

The paper extends on variational continual learning to the class-incremental learning scenario but it is unclear what are the particular benefits of extending over VCL rather than other approaches. \n\nIt is nice that the paper writes the problem and solution in a clear mathematical form but what the conclusions and solutions can be easily explained with natural language. The mathematical proof seems unnecessary, which can be moved to supplemental. \n\nThe novelty of the proposed method is very limited. The resulting solution is replay (similar to all replay methods like GEM, DER, DER++, GSS, [1], [2], [3], etc.) and perform distillation (similar to LwF) on the feature extraction part. But the solution is widely recognized as useful and proved in many prior works. I cannot identify any other contributions. \n\nThe comparison is not convincing. Results are not compared to more recent works such as DER and [1][2][3] so it is not convincing that the result is significant at the current time. \n\n[1] Rishabh Tiwari et al.

I would to address some of the questions you raised. \n\nThe innovative aspects of our work can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Theoretical analysis for the first time identifies the reasons behind the poor performance of the VCL algorithm in class-incremental learning scenarios.\n\n2. Comprehensive demonstration of the impact of new data on catastrophic forgetting, providing insights for the development of new continual learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting.\n\n3. Introduction, for the first time, of the brain mechanism of sleep memory consolidation to develop novel continual learning algorithms.\n\nThe aim of this work is to identify the reasons why VCL, a classic and promising method, performs poorly in Class-IL scenarios and to propose a brain-inspired algorithm to address this issue. One oversight on our part was neglecting to provide an explanation for why improvements were made to the VCL method. In fact, this stems from the understanding in numerous neuroscience studies that the human brain operates based on Bayesian inference, and VCL is designed around Bayesian inference. Therefore, among the various algorithms emulating the continuous learning ability of the human brain, VCL is a particularly promising method.\n\nYour suggestions regarding the theoretical aspects are highly constructive, and we appreciate this feedback. The theoretical section aims to elucidate the reasons behind the failure of the VCL method, leading to an excessive amount of background information. We plan to rewrite and include this information in the supplementary materials.\n\nThank you for your additions concerning comparative algorithms and relevant research literature; we will incorporate additional experiments accordingly.\n\nOnce again, we appreciate your insights, and we will make further modifications to the work based on this feedback."

This is an innovative aspect that we are highly confident in and will continue to explore.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your concerns regarding the methodological aspects. Our approach is based on an understanding of memory consolidation during the sleep process, specifically mapping encoded old memories to new memory spaces. This represents a compromise between brain mechanisms and deep learning methods. While it may not align perfectly with brain mechanisms, the necessity for algorithmic improvements arises from the spatial changes that lead to catastrophic forgetting in deep learning methods.\n\nDue to time constraints, further experimental validation has not been extensively covered, and we plan to enhance the reliability of this work in subsequent research. Your point about the advantageous impact of a larger buffer size on our method is intriguing, and we are keen on further exploring this aspect.\n\nIf you find our work interesting, we would be more than willing to communicate with you after the anonymity period concludes."

It can be considered as a combination of a rehearsal technique with parameter distribution regularization. The experiments conducted show the performance of LwS on various CL benchmark scenarios, including both task incremental and class incremental learning."

I find this a strong statement, so one would expect a serious in-depth analysis. Meanwhile, the reasoning presented in Section 3 seems only to formalize (perhaps sometimes in an unnecessarily complicated way) some natural observations.\n\n(3) Since LwS includes a data buffer, its fair experimental competitors are the other replay-based models. In this respect, the authors only present a comparison with iCaRL (2017) and A-GEM (2019)."
