                    "value": "(1) First and foremost, the novelty is quite limited. As a reviewer of ICLR, one of the top AI conferences, I expect to see great contributions to the deep learning community. However, the PLM algorithms including ESM-2, AnKh, ProtBert, and others are very mature techniques. The multi-task training with a secondary structure prediction is kind of interesting but still trivial. The author ought to provide more discussion and deeper insight regarding the benefit of this multi-task scheme in the main text. To summarize, the author just examine an existing methodology (i.e., PLMs) on some publicly available datasets (PDBBind + ESM-2 SSP) with a straightforward training paradigm (fixed embedding and [CLS] for prediction). \n\n(2) It really confused me that whether the author aims to predict ligand-specific or ligand-free pockets. To be explicit, can different small molecules bind to different pockets in the same protein? If so, should we predict pocket based on the information of ligand rather than solely on the receptor? If not, that is, all molecules bind in the same position of the protein. The author still needs to union the positions to obtain the final pocket. However, the approach did not utilize any ligand representations. \n\n(3) PLMs have shown promise in solving biological problems. However, it utilizes no structural information. Since we do have structural data in PDBBind, it really cannot convince me that PLMs are the best solution to predict cryptic pockets. (i) Please examine and compare more baselines (I am not familar with this specific task, and the references listed may be wrong) [A][B]. (ii) Machine-learning-based docking method can be also transferred to predict the pocket, such as EquiBind, and DiffDock. Please examine them. (iii) Please equip geometric networks (e.g., PocketMiner) with PLMs and verify the performance. See [C] for more details. I suppose PLMs + geometric models should outperform PLMs. \n\n[A] Accelerating Cryptic Pocket Discovery Using AlphaFold. \n\n[B] Graph Attention Site Prediction (GrASP): Identifying Druggable Binding Sites Using Graph Neural Networks with Attention\n\n[C] Integration of pre-trained protein language models into geometric deep learning networks\n\n\n(4) As a machine learning paper, it is very necessary to offer adequate experimental details for readers to reproduce the results (at least in the Appendix). For instance, how many computational resources (e.g., GPUs) have been used in the training? What is the optimizer type and how high is the learning rate? \n\n(5) I believe it is better to clearly explain the types of PLMs that are used in the evaluation (at least in the Appendix). For instance, Ankh is new to me, and I have to search for details of this model myself. Besides, ESM-2 has no reference when the first time it appears.  \n\n(6) Make sure words are spelled correctly. For example, on Page 9 'PBDbind' should be 'PDBbind'."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "(1) In Section 5.2, the author uses the average embedding as a pseudo-[CLS] token for ProtT5-XL. However, in the official document of ESM-2, it is also recommended to use the average embedding as the representation of the entire protein. Have the author tried this style for training?\n\n(2) A minor point is that the authors adopt an unusual arrangement to organize the sections, which accords with the template of Spring Nature Journals. From my humble point of view, a standard format of AI conference is to put the method section before the result and conclusion sections."

This is within scope as outlined in the call for papers.  BERT was not a new algorithm either, it was a new application, trained with publicly available data.\n\nOutperforming SOTA by such a large margin, on such an impactful application in small molecule pharmaceutical discovery is a noteworthy contribution to ML that should encourage many avenues of future work and be a net benefit for the human race.  \n\nRegarding SSP, it was not consistently a benefit, however this is important to report for future investigators.\n\nThe closest related work is PocketMiner, which has the goal of identifying residues--but not any ligand--that are likely to participate in or comprise cryptic pockets.\n\nWe mentioned as future work the combination of this approach with geometric approaches.\n\nEquibind and Diffdock are fundamentally different approaches concerned with finding a binding pose given a protein and a ligand, which is a question that this work is not trying to answer.  If this were a docking application then they would be more relevant.\n\nRegarding implementation and computational details, please see the methods section for details on the optimizer.  The learning rate required some experimentation and was not the same for all model types presented.  The model sizes are described and models were trained on single GPUs (no DDP or similar necessary).\n\nReferences to all PLMs are included, and a detailed discussion of them would not leave room sufficient to explain the work done.\n\nRegarding specific questions:\n1.  No ESM-2 embeddings were not averaged, although that could be added to the current results.\n2.  The methods section can be rearranged to be after the background."

The ones on the left and middle show predictions ranging from zero to one and represented by a colormap with blue as zero and red as one (with green as 0.5).  The rightmost of each group of three protein visualizations is the test set ground truth--which does have it's own particular definition.  The test set proteins can be grouped into two types of samples.  The first type has positive signal for residues labeled as definitively being associated with cryptic pockets, and in those samples green means \"unknown,\" and that the green residues are masked such that no loss is incurred for any prediction for those residues.  Scoring is only done for the positive (red) residues in that case.  The negative examples are the opposite, where blue residues in negative examples are definitively associated with not being associated with cryptic pockets, and green is unknown and masked as before.\n\nRegarding cryptic pockets, section 2.1 is explicitly about them.  The references of PocketMiner and CryptoSite provide additional background, and are studies aimed at identifying them."

                    "value": "This paper introduces Efficient Sequence-based cryptic Pocket prediction (ESP), which is a method for predicting cryptic binding pockets on protein sequences using pre-trained protein language models (PLMs). The embeddings drawn from the PLM are fed into a prediction head, which is responsible for predicting the presence of a cryptic pocket at each residue. Optionally, a multi-task setting is also considered, where the secondary structure of the protein is also predicted using the PLM embeddings. Several popular PLMs and prediction heads are evaluated, and it is shown that with the right combination of PLM and prediction head, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art PocketMiner baseline in cryptic pocket prediction performance."

The proposed method could potentially impact the design of drugs that could bind to proteins through cryptic ligandable pockets."

This is understandable since the purpose of the paper is to showcase that PLMs could be beneficial in identifying cryptic pockets in proteins, but I wonder whether ICLR is the best venue for such work to be published and gain visibility."

                    "value": "- The authors mention that ESP provides more localized positive cryptic pocket predictions as compared to PocketMiner, whose positive predictions are more broadly distributed. Given the knowledge that cryptic pockets tend to have local structures, could such prior knowledge be injected into the prediction model, for example, as a regularizer (where local positive predictions are encouraged during model training, while negative ones are discouraged)?\n\n- Could you please provide more details on the secondary structure prediction (SSP) task? How many classes is this task composed of? Is there a separate prediction head for structure prediction on top of the cryptic pocket prediction head? Why and how is its weight in the objective function chosen to be 1?\n\n- In Section 5.3, it is mentioned that the results are reported for the *best* model from 7 trials. I was expecting that for each specific configuration (i.e., PLM/head/task), the *average* performance (and its *standard deviation*) across the seven random trials would get reported, not the *maximum* performance.\n\n- The number of parameters for ESP in Table 7, especially with the MLP 1024 and MHA heads, is orders of magnitude larger than the number of parameters of PocketMiner. This is not even taking into account the number of PLM parameters (which are taken to be frozen in this paper). How does ESP perform compared to PocketMiner for a comparable number of parameters?\n\n- I may have missed these, but there are certain acronyms in the manuscript that are not defined anywhere in the paper (such as AUC, APS, LR, CLS). Please review the manuscript and make sure all acronyms are defined the first time they are used."

                        "value": "Thank you for your effort in reading and considering our work and its impact.\n\nWe appreciate your concern regarding algorithmic novelty and venue.  Our thinking is that if something simple significantly outperforms SOTA for an impactful application then that's an important contribution.  It also paves the way for future work to build upon the lessons learned, one of which being the marginal benefit of SSP in this context.\n\nThat's definitely an interesting idea, to regularize based on the overall size and number of residues comprising ground truth cryptic pockets.  This work focused on using the simplest possible process, and would be a relevant baseline for introduction of a regularizer as you describe.\n\nSSP is a relatively basic and low impact task whereby each residue is a member of eight or nine classes (depending on formulation).  ESM-2 SSP classes start with the 8 canonical DSSP classes:  \n    G = 3-turn helix (310 helix). Min length 3 residues.\n    H = 4-turn helix (\u03b1 helix). Minimum length 4 residues.\n    I = 5-turn helix (\u03c0 helix). Minimum length 5 residues.\n    T = hydrogen bonded turn (3, 4 or 5 turn)\n    E = extended strand in parallel and/or anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet conformation. Min length 2 residues.\n    B = residue in isolated \u03b2-bridge (single pair \u03b2-sheet hydrogen bond formation)\n    S = bend (the only non-hydrogen-bond based assignment).\n    C = coil (residues which are not in any of the above conformations)\n(ref:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_secondary_structure)\n   And the ESM-2 SSP dataset also uses \"X\" as unknown, making for 9 classes overall.\n The SSP class outputs are in a multi-task setup with the cryptic pocket prediction, sharing everything except the final output neuron.  It's relative weight in the objective function was experimented with and empirically determined to produce best results at 1.\n\nWhile average and standard deviation are commonly used in ML literature, because this is a small molecule pharmaceutical application, the performance of the best model is the actual limiting factor in real-world application.  Evaluating methodologies by their best model is therefore most informative regarding practice.\n\nIt's definitely a valid point regarding the vast expansion of the trainable parameter space compared to PocketMiner.  However, for Ankh, even logistic regression makes an improvement to ROCAUC.  This does not take into account the parameters of the PLM.  However, it's not clear that PocketMiner can meaningfully scale to larger numbers of trainable parameters in the sense that graph methods have scaling issues regarding run time, and more parameters doesn't always mean more efficacy.  This is an interesting discussion to include in more detail in future work.\n\nWe are happy to explicitly define those acronyms, either in the main text or an appendix.\n\nThank you again for your thoughtful feedback, and looking forward to your reply."
