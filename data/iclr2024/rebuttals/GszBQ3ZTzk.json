(14) and (15).\n\n- As shown in **Experiments settings** on Page 6, all of the hyper-parameters are set to 1. It seems they don\u2019t have large variances in magnitudes. However, the test datasets focus on $x, t$ dimensions, which can be regarded as 1D PDEs in physics-informed learning. 1D PDEs are relatively easy to learn, and the optimization issues are not severe. I am wondering if the authors could test on more challenging 2D datasets in traffic modeling."

However, in the domain of traffic prediction, researchers also consider RMSE and MAPE to measure the errors from different perspectives. Is it possible to add more evaluation metrics since the traffic data has some rush hour phenomena, where extreme statistics are needed? \n\n- Regarding the noise setting in Section 3.4, is it common to set the noise ratio by using a small covariance of 0.01/0.04 in the Gaussian distribution? Can the authors add some references here?\n\n---\n**Refs:**\n\n[1] Krishnapriyan, Aditi, et al. \"Characterizing possible failure modes in physics-informed neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 26548-26560.\n\n[2] Wang, Sifan, Yujun Teng, and Paris Perdikaris. \"Understanding and mitigating gradient flow pathologies in physics-informed neural networks.\" SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing 43.5 (2021): A3055-A3081."

Specifically, due to the well-known complexity of coupled modeling of physics information (in the form of PDE based conservation conditions) and data-driven (e.g., Mean-squared error) losses, the paper proposes a de-coupled method of modeling these two steps by first employing a physics-informed neural network to model the PDE based losses and a Bayesian Neural Network to model the data-driven losses. Further, a feed-forward neural network is employed to ensemble the predictions of the physics-informed and data-driven components by employing the latent representations from each of the two (I.e., physics-informed and data-driven) models. The ensemble model (infused with both data-driven and physics-driven knowledge) is trained in a data-driven manner and knowledge from the ensemble (teacher) model is distilled into each individual physics-driven, data-driven (student) models. In this manner, employing a combination of ensemble modeling, physics informed neural networks and knowledge distillation, the paper proposes a Physics-Informed Deep Learning (PIDL) solution for traffic state estimation."

The author's approach seems to amalgamate all available techniques into the model to ascertain if performance can be improved, resembling a combination of existing strategies. At least within this paper, the author fails to provide a rationale for choosing this particular strategy, thereby giving readers an impression of a brute-force stacking of various established methods. \n3. Experiment 3.4 Noise Robustness Analysis \nThe PDED has better noise robustness compared to the baselines since it utilizes the BNN to measure data uncertainty and adopts uncertainty to guide the fusion process. However, the comparison with the other two models is not rigorous enough. While a significant part of the robustness improvement in your model can be attributed to the integration of the BNN, it's inconclusive whether the NN and PIDL models, if augmented with uncertainty quantification, would demonstrate weaker noise robustness than PDED."
