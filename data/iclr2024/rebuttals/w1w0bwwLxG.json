This results in improved model performance and generalization, directly benefiting OOD detection. The fine-tuning process is time-efficient, yielding significant OOD performance enhancements within just one epoch. The versatile method enhances various OOD detection strategies across different architectures, as demonstrated by state-of-the-art results on standard OOD benchmarks, with comprehensive theoretical and empirical backing provided."

This article seems to solely focus on adapting SAM for the task of OOD detection, a point of innovation that appears rather weak to support the entirety of the paper.\n2. The authors claim that there is no need for real OOD data; however, looking at the form of the SAM loss, it seems that utilizing real OOD data could work just as well. I am curious if employing real OOD data for fine-tuning in conjunction with SAM loss could potentially yield better results.\n3. The results presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 indicate that SFT may not always achieve optimal performance across all OOD datasets, a phenomenon that the authors have not explained in detail.\n4.

Likewise, for VGG11 on CIFAR-10, SFT improves the Energy baseline and propels the performance of MSP to a competitive level. The authors also explore the influence of different normalization layers on the performance of SFT. They discover that SFT is consistent in augmenting the performance across networks with different normalization layers. Overall, the paper\u2019s contributions encompass the introduction of the SFT technique, which boosts the performance of post hoc methods for OOD detection, and the illustration of its effectiveness across different benchmarks and normalization layers."

This point is critical as OE is a strong baseline and might be the main source for OOD detection improvement.\n- Some parts of the paper lack clarity and are hard to follow. In particular, is Proposition 1 related to the upper bound of the Energy score or the upper bound of the variation of the Energy score? Moreover, the link between the bound and the better separability is not clear in the main paper and should be made explicit.\n- The method appears to struggle in near-OOD scenarios, as seen in the results for the iNaturalist dataset, where it falls significantly below top-performing baselines.

Here, why use big transfer for conducting the evaluation, and are all the baselines evaluated with the same backbone in Table 1 ? This point is critical as different backbones show drastically different OOD detection performances. In Tables 2 and 3, it seems that all the experiments are conducted with the same backbones. However, the choice of T2T-ViT and VGG-11 rather than a simple Vit or a ResNet is unclear and makes comparisons between OOD papers difficult.\n- In the appendix, Remark 1 only holds if $f$ is convex which is hardly the case for the deep neural networks. The following derivation starting from eq. (6) might thus be incorrect in the general setting."

                    "value": "Writing: \n\nThe paper is missing important definitions and descriptions of relevant algorithms and terms, and generally lacks the necessary precision to be able to fully understand the paper. This includes: SAM, energy, the \"statistical distance\" $D$ (from equation 2), the precise definition of $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{out}$, summaries of the relevant algorithms. Even when provided with a citation that includes the relevant definitions, I think it would be very helpful to provide at least a brief summary of each term and to clarify terminology. \n\nIn addition, at times, the notation is a bit confusing: $f$ is used as both a neural network and a loss function. In equation 3, the parameters are written as $w^t$ but $t$ is never used. \n\nTheory:\n\nThe statement of Proposition 1 is lacking some formality. As mentioned above, \"Energy\" should be properly defined. In addition, it was unclear to me (before reading the proof) what the authors mean by \"the change during the fine-tuning process\", how $\\Delta$ is defined, and what the authors mean by \"an irreducible constant\". In addition, the comment that \"the upper bound of the change of Energy score can improve the separation between ID and OOD\" should not be included in the statement of the proposition. In addition, the fine-tuning process should be clearly and precisely defined.\n\nThe statement is also only proved for a single step of fine-tuning, and not for the full fine-tuning process.\n\nThe proof (and statement) of Proposition 1 is extremely similar to Theorem C.5 in Mueller et al. (2023), and the majority of the proof is copied verbatim. I think it would help to clearly delineate the contribution of this paper and that of prior work and cite the relationship in the main paper.\n\nI'm also not sure I understand the purpose of the Proposition: the bound establishes a relationship between $\\Delta(\\operatorname{Energy})$ and $\\Delta(\\operatorname{max}(g))$. As I understand, the authors argue that since $\\Delta(\\operatorname{max}(g))$ is empirically verified to be smaller for OOD points than ID points, and thus $\\Delta(\\operatorname{Energy})$ will also be smaller. However, this does not follow from establishing only an upper bound, and secondly, why not directly verify that $\\Delta(\\operatorname{Energy})$ is smaller, and skip the comparison with $\\Delta(\\operatorname{max}(g))$ (which the authors do in Figure 4)?\n\nEmpirical:\n\nIn order to have a fair comparison, it's necessary to tune hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and $\\rho$) which are likely to have a potentially large impact on the model, and may need to be tuned differently for different models, datasets, and algorithms. (It's worth noting that the authors do include an ablation where they vary $\\rho$ for one architecture). There are a couple potential issues with the results (see questions section below), that cast doubt for me as to whether the results are sound.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nMaximilian Mueller, Tiffany Vlaar, David Rolnick, and Matthias Hein.

This, to me, suggests that SAM is likely not properly tuned, e.g., $\\rho$ is too large and thus the training is unstable.\n- In Table 8, Adam seems to do exceptionally worse than SGD and SFT. Typically Adam expects a smaller learning rate than SGD, could this cause training instabilities that lead to such low accuracy?"
