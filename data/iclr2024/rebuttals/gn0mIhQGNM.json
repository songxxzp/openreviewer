                        "value": "We express our sincere gratitude to Reviewer vf6N for the recognition of the completeness of our experimental work. And greatly appreciate for proposing insightful comments regarding the generative model perspective. Below, we provide our responses to the comments, denoted by **[W]** for weaknesses and **[E]** for ethics concerns.\n\n**Response to W1 regarding low generation quality:**\n\nThis is a valuable comment. Yes, MU could trigger a possible tradeoff between unlearning effectiveness (*i.e.* UA) and preserved generation quality (*i.e.* FID). This is an open challenge that remains in the field: How to strike the optimal tradeoff between these two factors [R1]. Table 2 shows such as tradeoff to some extent, where our methods achieve a much better unlearning performance than the baselines ESD and FMN while suffering a slight generation quality drop in FID. We will clearly point out this tradeoff and provide more discussions in the revision.\n\n> [R1] Jia, Jinghan, et al. \"Model Sparsity Can Simplify Machine Unlearning.\" Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems. 2023.\n\n**Response to W2 regarding focusing on one version of the Latent Diffusion Model:**\n\nThank you so much for your suggestions! \n\nOur evaluation is focused on SD (stable diffusion) due to the fact that the evaluation benchmark I2P (for NSFW generation) and its testing framework were specifically designed around this latent diffusion model [R2]. Therefore, it serves as the most established testbed for assessing the performance of our unlearning method, allowing for fair comparisons with other baseline approaches such as ESD [R3] and FMN [R4] that use I2P. However, inspired by the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, in the revision we will conduct a sanity check for I2P on other versions of latent diffusion models and implement our method to remove its harmful influence or other NSFW-related prompts/concepts. \n\nWe want to express our gratitude for your suggestion to consider multiple seeds for image generation. It is important to note that we have already included the generation results from multiple seeds in Figures A1, A2, and A3. We are committed to providing additional results from various random seeds to ensure a comprehensive and robust evaluation of our method. Your feedback has been invaluable in enhancing the completeness of our research.\n\nTo clarify, in the NSFW-removal evaluation, we are using an I2P benchmark, which contains over 4.5k seed and text prompt pairs that are likely to produce inappropriate content.   In this scenario, the seeds are fixed with given prompts. Thus, following I2P, we did not break the pairing between the fixed seed and the fixed text prompt in Figure 6. The same strategy was also adopted in the baseline ESD for NSFW-removal evaluation.\n\n> [R2] Schramowski, Patrick, et al. \"Safe latent diffusion: Mitigating inappropriate degeneration in diffusion models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2023.\n> \n> [R3] Gandikota, Rohit, et al. \"Erasing concepts from diffusion models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.07345 (2023).\n> \n> [R4] Zhang, Eric, et al. \"Forget-me-not: Learning to forget in text-to-image diffusion models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.17591 (2023).\n\n**Response to E on offensive image generation:**\n\nWe acknowledge the ethical importance of your suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we will apply mosaic and blurring on generated images to prevent the dissemination of offensive content.\n\n------\n\nLast but not least, we would like to underscore our contributions and the solidity of our approach to machine unlearning, as highlighted by other reviewers:\n\n**Reviewer miKP**'s comments acknowledged the significance of our work:\n> \"Significance: the task is very relevant: machine unlearning for generative models, a very important topic to prevent harmful content generation, was lacking an effective solution.\"\n\nAs well, **Reviewer XDsn** also indicated our novelty:\n> \"SalUn introduces a novel gradient-based weight saliency approach, a significant departure from existing MU methods.\"\n\n**Reviewer TAAE** also acknowledged our contributions:\n> \"The proposed method is simple, intuitive, and extremely effective according to the experiments in the paper.\"\n> \n> \"Image generation is a great benchmark for these models, kudos to the authors for including experiments with diffusion models.\"\n\nIn light of the above, we hope that Reviewer vf6N can now better understand our work and its novelty."

This might impact the proposed method, since it is harder to pinpoint the weights that caused the unwanted behavior. Also, the random labeling approach for estimating saliency would also be suboptimal, because many tokens like articles and prepositions might be used in harmful as well as harmless sentences.\n- Experiments with zero-shot classification (CLIP) would have also been preferable wrt pure classification\n- There are many methods for weight saliency estimation, it would have been nice if the authors had ablated this component using different estimation methods.

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer TAAE for acknowledging the contributions, soundness, and presentation quality of our paper. We also greatly appreciate Reviewer TAAE for proposing the very insightful questions. Below, we provide our responses to the comments, denoted by **[W]** for weaknesses and **[Q]** for questions.\n\n**Response to W1 on disregarding classification and considering language generation tasks:** \n\nWe appreciate your insightful question! It is worth noting that unlearning for image classification tasks holds an important role within our work. Our unlearning approach has primarily been tailored for vision-related tasks rather than language-related ones.\n\n1. **Reason for incorporating image classification tasks:** MU has received considerable attention and extensive study within the realm of image classification tasks. A multitude of MU methods have been developed for this purpose. However, it remains skeptical that none of the existing works applied these methods to image generation tasks, which carries a significant need to avoid generating content associated with NSFW (Not Safe For Work) concepts. To delve deeper into this, we conducted an initial examination of existing MU approaches applied to image classification in Section 4. During this investigation, we identified certain limitations inherent to these methods, *i.e.*, the lack of stability and task generality. Building upon these results, we introduced the concept of weight saliency for unlearning. We aim to maintain the effectiveness of MU across both classification and generation tasks.\n2. **Divergence between vision models and language models:** We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the potential of MU for language generation, which is indeed an intriguing avenue for future research. However, we must acknowledge that this is beyond the scope of our current work. The divergence between vision models and language models introduces unique challenges, such as the intricate investigation required for defining structural units for saliency computation in language models, e.g., attention heads or weights/columns in feedforward network modules. Moreover, as pointed out by the reviewer, language models present other complexities in the selection of unlearning saliency loss functions. Furthermore, our awareness of machine unlearning works for language models was limited [R1, R2, R3]. Encouraged by the reviewer's feedback, we plan to incorporate these relevant works into our related work section and acknowledge the potential of exploring MU in language generation as a direction for future research.

                        "value": "**Response to W2 regarding zero-shot classification (CLIP):**\n\nWe acknowledge that zero-shot classification is indeed an interesting setting for unlearning. Building upon the reviewer's suggestion, we carried out an additional experiment involving a pre-trained ResNet-50-based CLIP model (see **Table R4**). In this experiment, we aimed to assess the unlearning ability of CLIP to \"forget\" the influence of a particular CIFAR-10 image class (*i.e.*, the target class for unlearning). Given the zero-shot classification constraint, we assume that the unlearner only has access to the forgetting dataset, consisting of CIFAR-10 data points belonging to the class designated for unlearning. In this context, the suitable unlearning method is GA (gradient ascent) which only relies on the forgetting dataset [R4], and our proposal becomes the saliency-guided GA (like GA + $m_S$ in Table A1). The unlearning evaluation follows Table A1, where **UA** indicates more effective unlearning, and the higher **TA** signifies better generalization. As we can see, our approach outperforms GA in both unlearning effectiveness and preserved zero-shot classification ability. Meanwhile, we also observed that the GA-based unlearning seems to inevitably hamper the zero-shot classification ability at testing time. We believe that unlearning for zero-shot classification presents its own distinct set of challenges. This is primarily because there can be a substantial disconnect or mismatch between the training dataset and the testing dataset in this context. This is a very insightful question. Thanks!\n\n**Table R4**: MU Performance of zero-shot classification (CLIP), for forgetting within a single class.

IEEE, 2022\n\n**Response to W3 regarding other weight saliency methods in continual learning literature:**\n\nWe appreciate the suggestion to explore the continual learning corpus. However, it seems that in this context, the notion of saliency aligns more with the **data** level rather than the **weight** level. We are enthusiastic about broadening our comprehension, particularly regarding any existing literature on weight saliency within continual learning. We would greatly appreciate additional guidance or insights from Reviewer TAAE in this regard.\n\n**Response to W4 regarding limitations of the proposed method:**\n\nThanks for raising this question. We will further strengthen the Limitation section (Appendix C) in the supplement.  Specifically, we will elaborate on the potential limitations below\n\n1. The characteristics of language tasks, as opposed to vision tasks, suggest that saliency units in LMs may encompass more complex structures such as attention heads or feedforward network weights/columns. In addition, the saliency evaluation loss should also be carefully designed for language tasks. Thus, the efficacy of our proposed methods on LLMs requires additional exploration.\n2. The heuristic-based approach for saliency threshold selection has demonstrated empirical success; nevertheless, an automated mechanism for optimal threshold determination remains a goal for future research, particularly for application to novel model architectures.\n\n---\n\nWe hope our responses sufficiently address the concerns raised and contribute to the constructive dialogue around our submission. We are looking forward to hearing from Reviewer TAAE for further discussion."

We are equally appreciative of the constructive questions posed. Below, we provide our responses to the comments, denoted by **[W]** for weaknesses and **[Q]** for questions.\n\n**Response to W1 and Q3 on limitation discussion:**\n\nThank you for bringing up this question. We will add more discussions on the potential limitations of our technique in the main texts and enhance the Limitation section (Appendix C) in the supplement to provide a more comprehensive understanding of potential limitations. In particular, we will elaborate on the following points: \n1. Language tasks exhibit different characteristics compared to vision tasks, which suggests that saliency units in Language Models (LMs) may involve more complex structures, such as attention heads or feedforward network weights/columns. In addition, the design of saliency evaluation loss should also be approached with careful consideration for language tasks. Therefore, the effectiveness of our proposed methods on LMs warrants further investigation. \n2. While our heuristics-based approach for saliency threshold selection has shown empirical success, the pursuit of an automated mechanism to determine optimal thresholds remains a goal for future research. This is especially important when considering the application of our methods to novel model architectures. \n\n\n\n**Response to Q1 on incremental unlearning:**\n\nThanks for raising this question. Based on your suggestion, we conducted iterative unlearning experiments (see **Table R3** below) by incrementally forgetting 10% of the data over five iterations (50% of data in total), *i.e.*, for each iteration the forgetting set $(D_f)$ is 10% of the whole dataset, given ResNet-18 on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We evaluate the unlearning performance of our method by comparing it with the gold standard, retraining. Additionally, we assess its performance in comparison to an unlearning baseline, FT (fine-tuning). The results are presented in the following table. Notably, even as data points are progressively forgotten, our method demonstrates a consistently minimal performance gap with Retrain, as evidenced by the smallest value in the \"Avg.

In comparison to Retrain, SalUn exhibits significantly improved computational efficiency. This efficiency stems from the fact that, unlike Retrain, which necessitates retraining the model from scratch after removing forgotten data points, SalUn's computational process primarily involves two key components: The gradient-based weight saliency map, and a fast approximate unlearning procedure. The saliency map, as outlined in Eq. 4, provides a plug-in guidance on which variables should be updated during the unlearning process. As a result, SalUn's efficiency aligns with that of \u201cfast\u201d approximate unlearning methods. We have quantified this efficiency in terms of runtime efficiency (RTE), as presented in relevant tables, such as Table 1 and A1. It is worth noting that SalUn's efficiency remains applicable even when dealing with a larger dataset. For instance, in scenarios involving Stable Diffusion, retraining is often not a feasible solution for removing the influence of NSFW concepts. This makes SalUn a practical and efficient choice."

                        "value": "We extend our sincerest thanks to Reviewer miKP for the meticulous examination of our work, including the supplement materials, and for the encouraging comments on the contributions and presentation quality of our paper. We also appreciate the posted constructive questions. Below, we provide our responses to the comments, denoted by **[W]** for weaknesses and **[Q]** for questions.\n\n**Response to W1 regarding nearly 100% RA accuracy:**\n\nThank you for your question. To provide a more comprehensive answer, let us revisit the evaluation metrics in **MU for image classification** of Sec. 3. When assessing MU, it is essential to consider three key aspects: \n\n1. **Unlearning fidelity** (UA, MIA in classification, UA in generation): This aspect assesses whether the model can successfully unlearn previously learned information. \n2. **Preserved generalization or generation ability** (RA, TA in classification, FID in generation): This measures the model's ability to maintain comparable \"accuracy\" or performance on tasks unrelated to the unlearning process. \n3. **Run-time efficiency** (RTE).\n\nGiven the 2nd criterion, **RA** and **TA** should be considered together because RA evaluates performance on the remaining training dataset, while TA evaluates performance on the testing dataset. Since the remaining dataset has been previously seen by the pre-trained model, it is not surprising that RA could maintain at a relatively high level, especially in the scenario of random data forgetting. Thus, RA can be regarded as a sanity checker of a \u201cgood\u201d unlearning method without losing accuracy in the remaining training set. However, it is important to note that despite most of RA being close to 100% in Table 1, this does not imply that different unlearning methods perform equally well in the 2nd criterion mentioned above (preserved generalization/generation ability). It is evident from Table 1 that TA exhibits a higher rate of change when compared to RA across various unlearning methods.\n\nBased on the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have conducted an **additional experiment** on the TinyImageNet dataset (see **Table R1**) with a larger image size of 64 * 64 than CIFAR-10/100. Due to time constraints, we focused on evaluating our approach against the fine-tuning (FT) and gradient ascent (GA) unlearning baselines. We also included the performance of the Retrain method for the sake of comparison. As evident from the results, both FT and GA fall short of matching the performance of our method, SalUn. This underperformance is notably reflected in the larger performance gap (Ave. Gap) when compared to the performance of Retrain. To delve deeper into the specifics, FT appears to excel in preserving generalization ability (criterion 2), yet it struggles when it comes to the unlearning aspect (criterion 1). Conversely, GA exhibits effectiveness in the unlearning process, but at the cost of significantly diminishing both RA and TA.\n\n**Table R1**: MU Performance on ResNet-18, pre-trained on Tiny ImageNet, for forgetting within a single class. The table format follows Table A2.\n|         |  UA  |  RA   |  TA   | MIA  | Avg. Gap |\n| :-----: | :--: | :---: | :---: | :--: | :-------: |\n| Retrain | 100  | 98.66 | 65.07 | 100  |     0     |\n|   FT    | 24.6 | 99.78 | 64.41 | 49.6 |   31.89   |\n|   GA    | 86.8 | 90.35 | 58.35 | 92.2 |   9.01    |\n|  Ours   | 87.6 | 99.42 | 65.35 | 100  |   3.36    |\n\n\n\n\n**Response to W2 on the lack of justifications for loss choices:** \n\nThank you for raising this question. We believe there might exist a misunderstanding due to our unclear presentation in certain parts. We apologize for the confusion we have caused. Here we further clarify our loss choices.\n\n1. The forgetting loss in Eq. 3 is proposed for the computation of the saliency map, and it is given by the training loss over the forgetting dataset. Gradient ascent (GA) is the method name rather than the loss name. The rationale behind using Eq. 3 is inspired by the GA method as it favors unlearning fidelity performance [Sec. 5, R1]. We then use the forgetting loss of GA to identify the subset of weights salient to unlearning. \n \n2. After the determination of the saliency map, we employ a more advanced unlearning loss, tailored for not only unlearning fidelity but also preserved generalization/generation ability. A saliency map is a plug-in prior to which variables should be updated during unlearning. In other words, we used our proposed unlearning loss + saliency map (calculated by step 1 above). Table A1 demonstrates the impact of integrating the discovered saliency map into various unlearning methods.\n\n> [R1] Thudi, Anvith, et al. \"Unrolling sgd: Understanding factors influencing machine unlearning.\" 2022 IEEE 7th European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P).

                        "value": "**Response to W3 regarding the choice of hyperparameters in Eq. 7:**\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion. We provide an additional ablation study (see **Table R2** below) to showcase the influence of $\\alpha$ on the unlearning performance in image generation using Stable Diffusion (SD) on ImageNette. The experimental setup aligns with Table 2. To analyze the impact of the variable $\\alpha$ on both unlearning fidelity and preserved generation ability, we calculate FID scores for both the forgetting class condition $(C_f)$ and the remaining class condition $(C_r)$. \n\nWe aim for the generated images corresponding to the forgetting class not to belong anymore, meaning a higher UA closer to 100% is desirable. Simultaneously, we seek higher quality in the generated images, indicating a preference for a lower FID score. Further, we aim to minimize the discrepancy in the generated image quality between the forgetting and the remaining classes, signifying that a closer alignment between the FID scores of generated images is conditioned on the forgetting class and the remaining class. This ensures the proximity to the retrained model, as shown in Fig. 3. As illustrated in Table R2 when the parameter $\\alpha$ is varied within the range ${0.05, 0.5, 5}$, the unlearning task consistently maintains successful, with 100% UA (unlearning accuracy) for the generated images under the forgetting class condition $(C_f)$. However, it is worth noting that the choice of $\\alpha$ has a discernible impact on the quality of the generated images. This quality is quantified through the measurement of FID scores under both $C_f$ and the remaining class condition $(C_r)$, denoted as FID $(C_f)$ and FID $(C_r)$, respectively. When $\\alpha$ increases,  FID $(C_r)$ decreases. This is not surprising since there will be more penalization on the MSE loss under the remaining dataset in Eq. (7). In turn, this will hamper the forgetting term in Eq. (7), causing a higher FID $(C_f)$. Through the lens of aligned image generation quality regardless of $C_r$ or $C_f$, we then choose $\\alpha = 0.5$  in our experiments. \n\nIn an extreme case of $\\alpha=0$, we will face the issue of over-unlearning. This significantly compromises image generation quality. The FID scores under both the forgetting and remaining conditions are extremely high (~300), indicating the malfunctioning of the diffusion model in image generation. \n\nFurther, we evaluate the UA for diffusion models every epoch by generating a few samples under the forgetting condition, and stopping the unlearning process once the condition is successfully unlearned, *i.e.*, whether the UA approaching 100%. As Appendix B.1 mentioned, the empirical value for SD lands on 5 epochs.\n\n**Table R2:** Performance of class-wise forgetting on Imagenette using SD with different $\\alpha$. The setting follows Table 2.\n| $\\alpha$ | FID $(C_f)$ | FID $(C_r)$ | UA |\n|:--------:|:------:|:----------:|:----------:|\n|   0.05    |    2.35    |    7.72    | 100 |\n|   0.50   |    3.03    |    2.54    | 100 |\n|   5.00   |    5.07    |    0.84    | 100 |\n\n**Response to W4 regarding code availability:**\n\nWe acknowledge your suggestion and commit to making our code publicly available upon revision to facilitate transparency and reproducibility.\n\n**Response to Q regarding minor comments on figure presentation, reference, and wording:**\n\nThank you very much for the very careful reading.
