It is shown that under powersum polynomial features and inputs following the Vandermonde distribution, identities appear that are similar to those of Hermite polynomials in Gaussian space. Using this property, the authors track the high-dimensional gradient flow dynamics using a small number of summary statistics and show the recovery of the hidden direction in the single index model."

For example, the assumption on the activation is only verified for a particular choice that is not commonly used in practice, and the student link function $g$ needs to be carefully constructed using full information on the teacher link function $f$. However, these restrictions are understandable given that this work is a first attempt of studying the training dynamics of symmetric neural networks under a single index model.\n\n* The writing of the paper can be improved with examples provided below."

                    "value": "* The authors have mentioned why analyzing the SGD counterpart of the population gradient flow using the drift and martingale decomposition technique can be challenging. Another avenue for obtaining sample complexity is to use full-batch (empirical) gradient flow similar to Bietti et al., 2022 instead of the population version. I'm wondering if the six-stage proof can be adapted to handle such concentration errors and lead to a sample complexity.\n\n* A particularly relevant paper could be [1] where the authors consider learning a single index model with anisotropic Gaussian data, and show that a structure in the covariance can reduce sample/runtime complexity and even remove dependency on the information exponent. I am wondering if similar observations can be made in this paper by introducing additional structure in the inputs. Furthermore, some aspects of the current analysis also appear in [1] due to dealing with anisotropy, such as having to control a quantity of the type $\\Vert f(\\langle Aw, x\\rangle)\\Vert_{L^2}^2$ or preconditioning, which might be interesting to point out.\n\n* The squared Vandermonde density is never explicitly defined in the manuscript. Perhaps providing an explicit definition and recalling some of its relevant properties can help the readers better understand the problem setting.\n\n## Minor Comments:\n* Is the probability in Lemma 4.5 is over the randomness of $(a_m)$? In that case, it might be helpful to point this out in the statement of the lemma.\n* Theorem 4.2 point (iii) asks for $v_0 = 1 - r_0^2$. Could it be more intuitive to introduce this condition as $\\Vert Aw_0 \\Vert = 1$?\n---\n[1] Alireza Mousavi-Hosseini, Denny Wu, Taiji Suzuki, Murat A.

It is shown that gradient flow on some appropriately defined loss function based on a DeepSets student model structure converges to a student model whose parameters are highly correlated with the ground truth, in time that scales logarithmically with the approximation error parameter and exponentially to the (square of the) information exponent associated with the link function, whenever the chosen student model satisfies certain properties. Moreover, an explicit choice of the student model is proposed and precise bounds for the associated convergence rate are provided. The authors also provide experimental demonstration of their results on synthetic data.\n\nThe results in this paper work under a set of modeling assumptions. First, the teacher model is assumed to have a symmetric structure, in the sense that variable relabelling does not change the value of the function. Each of the unknown parameters influences each variable in the exact same way and, in particular, the $k$-th parameter multiplies the sum of all the monomials of degree $k$. Moreover, the link function is assumed to be analytic and supported on monomials of degree at most equal to the square root of the input dimension. Finally, the input distribution is assumed to be the squared Vandermode density, which is shown to enjoy properties in the symmetric setting analogous to those of the Gaussian for a non-symmetric setting.\n\nThe proof techniques used include complex calculus as well as a crucial identity of Vandermode distributions on the symmetric polynomials setting, which motivates establishing Vandermode distributions as the Gaussian analogue in the symmetric polynomials setting."

Stochastic gradient descent is likely much harder: the main issue is phase 1 in the ODE convergence proof, where we need to show that log r^2/v is decreasing in order to guarantee that the magnitude of the convergence r doesn't become unacceptably small.  It seems potentially possible to adapt the submartinagle arguments of [1] by taylor expanding the logarithm and defining appropriate stopping times, but it would require multiple expansions since r^2/v can vary dramatically in magnitude and different expansions would give different rates of convergence, so somewhat hard to tell if the rates would still be polynomial overall or not."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review, our response is below:\n\nAlthough gradient flow can be rescaled, we observe evidence from the literature that using constant rescaling is comparable to the sample complexity from comparable settings in gradient descent or stochastic gradient.  For example, in Theorem 5.3 in [1] the rates for all three methods are essentially equivalent.\n\nIn terms of lower bounds, it would be straightforward to have a lower bound of N^s.  Indeed, the convergence can only be faster if we initialize v = 0 and cos s theta = 1, in which case the ODE governing r is nearly equivalent to the one studied in [2].  However, unlike [2], it's not straightforward to get nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the problem: for one thing, the initialization guarantees are based on the condition number of the frozen matrix A, which is essentially equivalent to the condition number of a rectangular Vandermonde with nodes on the unit complex circle.  As far as we're aware this is still an active area of research to get tight bounds here, one representative paper in [3].\n\nIn terms of novelty, although other papers that use correlation loss [4], they can still track learning via a single parameter.  We necessarily have three parameters, since our correlation is complex and we can't project without solving the optimization problem onto an ellipsoid [5] at every step.  Therefore the technical novelty is treating the learning with a system of three ODEs, and in particular judiciously choosing the regularization so that the orthogonal part of the learned direction (v) shrinks faster than the correlation with the true direction (r) to guarantee eventual convergence.\n\nThe experiments are to confirm the expected behavior still occurs under full gradient descent, and to observe that the technical details of controlling the descent of r are not a proof artifact but a necessary detail, as the regularization pushes r down in the initlal parts of training.  As in the vanilla single index setting, higher initial alignment usually corresponds to faster convergence.\n\n[1] Jia, Zehui, Xingju Cai, and Deren Han. \"Comparison of several fast algorithms for projection onto an ellipsoid.\" Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics 319 (2017): 320-337.\n\n[1] Yehudai, Gilad, and Shamir Ohad. \"Learning a single neuron with gradient methods.\" Conference on Learning Theory.

We will include more discussion of this in an updated draft.\n\nThis is certainly still a single-index model in the sense of trying to recover a single hidden direction that can only be accessed through non-linear measurements.  And there is precedent for using a different link function in the student architecture than the teacher in the vanilla single index setting, see [1].\n\nThe suggestions given for clarity are appreciated.\n\n[1] Dudeja, Rishabh, and Daniel Hsu. \"Learning single-index models in gaussian space.\" Conference On Learning Theory.
