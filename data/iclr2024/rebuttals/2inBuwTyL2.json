                    "value": "This paper proposes a novel model for implementing the SE(3)-equivariance in robotic pick and place problems. Given a task involving placing an object relative to another object, the method first uses an equivariant network to calculate the desired distance between points on the two objects. The core innovation of the method is that given the desired distances from a point on object A to a set of points on object B, one can use multilateration to locate the desired location of this point relative to object B. Repeating this process for multiple points on object A, the relative pose between A and B could then be confirmed. The proposed method is evaluated against a number of baselines, where it demonstrates commendable performance, especially when the task requires high precision."

                    "value": "1. The idea of using multilateration to calculate the relative pose is a compelling aspect of this paper. It transforms the equivariant problem of calculating the desired relative pose into an invariant problem of calculating the desired relative distance, which could be useful to reduce the complexity of a model.\n2. The paper is well-written with intuitive examples to illustrate the idea."

                    "value": "My main concern with the paper is that the experimental evaluation is not strong enough. In the main paper, the experiments are mainly conducted in the Mug Hanging domain. In the two other domains in Table 3 in the appendix, the proposed method\u2019s performance is worse than the baselines. Though the authors discuss that the underperformance compared with TAX-Pose could be due to the lack of the implementation of the symmetry-breaking technique, the proposed method also lags behind NDF. Additionally, the performance of DON and NDF under 1cm and 3cm distance thresholds is not reported in either Table 1 or Table 3."

The paper would be much stronger if there is an environment that actually requires high place precision (e.g., gear/kit assembly) rather than merely adjusting the precision requirement in the mug-hang task. Moreover, incorporating the performance of NDF under the 1cm and 3cm precision requirements in Tables 1 and 3 would likely strengthen the paper as well.\n2. Does the proposed method have a faster runtime compared with the baselines? Does the proposed method have a higher sample efficiency? Since the idea of using multilateration reduces the equivariant problem into an invariant problem, I am curious about if there are benefits from this angle."

The paper would be much stronger if there is an environment that actually requires high place precision (e.g., gear/kit assembly) rather than merely adjusting the precision requirement in the mug-hang task.\n\nWe can certainly attempt to prepare an additional set of high-precision tasks to benchmark the performance of our method against baselines. Specifically, we are considering the following additional experiments:\n\n* 5 relative placement tasks from the RLBench suite of tasks. https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench\n    * Insert Peg (precise placement of disc on peg)\n    * Insert USB (precise placement of USB in computer)\n    * Toilet Roll on Stand\n    * Phone on Base\n    * Wine Bottle on Rack\n\nThere are no specific gear/kit assembly tasks in RLBench, but \u201cInsert Peg\u201d is quite close in spirit (and has existing demonstrations we can leverage).\n\nAdditionally, we are attempting to rectify the issues we faced with the TAX-Pose symmetry-breaking techniques that suppressed performance. Hopefully that will allow us to present complete results on Bottle and Bowl placement.\n\n**Question for the reviewer: Would including results on these additional tasks satisfy the reviewer\u2019s desire for more high-precision tasks? If not, are there additional specific existing benchmarks that the reviewer would like to see?**\n\n> Moreover, incorporating the performance of NDF under the 1cm and 3cm precision requirements in Tables 1 and 3 would likely strengthen the paper as well.\n\nWe agree that this would be a good and interesting evaluation. Time permitting, we will attempt to extract these values by the end of the evaluation period.\n\n> Does the proposed method have a faster runtime compared with the baselines?\n\nCompared to TAX-Pose, we require slightly more compute (due to the additional reasoning layers), but the sample complexity is only a constant factor difference. Compared to NDF, which uses an iterative optimization, we execute significantly faster since we only require a single forward pass of the network to regress.\n\n> Does the proposed method have a higher sample efficiency?\n\nBecause the network is SE(3) equivariant, we can learn per-object relationships from very few samples (potentially even from a single example). As for class-level relationships (i.e. generalizing to all mugs instead of a single mug), we will attempt an experiment which is similar to that presented in Table 2 of TAX-Pose, i.e. seeing how success rate changes with number in-class demonstrations.\n\nWe will provide another update with experiments as they are ready during the rebuttal period."

To summarize, our method achieves very high levels of precision (<1.25 degrees of rotational error, <2mm of translational error on average) on every task, which is within the tolerance margin for successful predictions for each task. The baseline we compare against, TAX-Pose, does not achieve this level of precision at convergence.\n\nWe switched out the \u201cInsert USB\u201d task because we found that the demo-generating code for this task was broken in the RLBench code release, yielding no demos on which to train. Instead, we have chosen a different high-precision task, \u201cPlace Hanger on Rack\u201d, where there is only ~1cm of clearance.\n\n**Given that our method achieves a high degree of precision on these 5 new high-precision tasks, would you consider increasing your score?**\n\nWe are also in the process of conducting additional experiments + writing to address your other concerns, and will post again tomorrow."

I think it severely damages the presentation of this paper.\n\nWe did reproduce some elements of the problem statement (including one figure) with permission from TAX-Pose authors. We did this to emphasize that the problem setting is nearly identical to theirs; however, we will reword certain sections to differentiate a bit. And we will create an original figure by the end of the rebuttal period to incorporate into the revised manuscript.\n\n> The result in Table 1 is margianl improvement compared with PAX-Pose, though the proposed method does exhibit some advantages in higher-precision settings.\n\nWe agree that the \u201coverall\u201d improvements appear somewhat small compared to TAX-Pose; however, the original evaluation procedure proposed by NDF and utilized by TAX-Pose is not particularly robust to geometrically-infeasible predictions, which means that predictions that look poor may still be counted as a success because of peculiarities of simulation modeling. That is why we introduced the \u201cprecision\u201d metric, to quantitatively demonstrate that our predictions result in higher-quality predictions than TAX-Pose that respect geometric constraints (and are thereby more precise) more frequently.\n\n> This method is evaluated with offline real-world trajectories collected by TAX-Pose. I won't accept this as real-world experiments.\n\nThis is a reasonable criticism. We included this experiment to demonstrate that our method could be trained on real-world data and produce reasonable predictions - however we stopped short of executing these predictions on a real robot system for specific implementation issues mentioned below.\n\n> In figure, the rotational error is 35 degrees. While the authors have made some explanations, I won't regard it as a satisfactory result.\n\nWe agree that this rotational error appears unsatisfactory. The metric we chose to present, rotational error w.r.t. A held-out set of demonstrations, does not inherently capture the multimodality of the demonstration set. There are many viable predictions that result in task success, which may differ dramatically in rotation from those seen in demonstrations. For instance, hanging the mug to the left side and to the right side are both valid (and appear in the demonstration set). A better evaluation would be task success rate, where we measure how frequently the predictions lead to a good placement on a real robot system.\n\n> Will there be genuine real-world experiments conducted in the future?\n\nWe do have a robot system in our lab with 4 cameras and a robot arm, and before submission did attempt to build a system which would execute the predictions made by our method. We were able to get predictions, however unfortunately we struggled to calibrate the robot arm\u2019s motion to the cameras to a degree of precision which is necessary to execute the predictions open-loop with motion planning. We were able to get 2-3cm end-effector precision in our system, which is not sufficient to place mugs on racks effectively. This was independent of our RelDist prediction quality; it was purely an engineering issue.\n\nBecause of the complexity of increasing end-effector precision in a calibrated 4-camera setup, we don\u2019t believe we will be able to produce robot experiments by the end of the rebuttal period (in 12 days). However it is definitely on our roadmap to build a robust real-world evaluation setup eventually which has the hand-eye calibration precision required.\n\n**Question for the reviewer: Are there any real-world experiments you might accept that don\u2019t require executing the RelDist predictions on a real robot?**"

The methodology looks pretty promising (equivariant + differentiable optimization process) and generic, as a submission to a ML conference, one would expect to see a more diverse evaluation of the approach.\n\nOther weaknesses identified pertain to limitations in handling symmetric objects or multimodal placement tasks, as acknowledged by the authors. This could restrict the system's application in scenarios where multiple correct poses exist. Additionally, the requirement for segmented task-relevant objects can be a significant limitation in unstructured environments. The paper could be improved by exploring these aspects further, possibly by integrating generative models or unsupervised segmentation methods.\n\nHowever, overall, I would still think the paper is slightly above the threshold, while a more complete evaluation could well strengthen the paper."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their feedback, and for recognizing the novelty of our formulation, RelDist, in solving relative placement tasks in a provably SE(3)-Equivariant way. We also appreciate that the reviewer felt that the work was clear and of high-quality.\n\nTo address the questions specifically:\n\n> Could experimental results be further augmented with a more diverse set of tasks or scenarios? What could be the choices?\n\nWe can certainly attempt to prepare an additional set of tasks to benchmark the performance of our method against baselines. Specifically, we are considering the following additional experiments:\n\n* 5 relative placement tasks from the RLBench suite of tasks. https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench\n    * Insert Peg (precise placement of disc on peg)\n    * Insert USB (precise placement of USB in computer)\n    * Toilet Roll on Stand\n    * Phone on Base\n    * Wine Bottle on Rack\n\nIn each of these tasks, we would only evaluate the placement of an object relative to another object (and therefore eliminate the need to do robot control for grasping), which should demonstrate applicability across a wider range of tasks.\n\nAdditionally, we are attempting to rectify the issues we faced with the TAX-Pose symmetry-breaking techniques that suppressed performance. Hopefully that will allow us to present accurate results on Bottle and Bowl placement.\n\n**Question for the reviewer: Would including these additional experiments strengthen the paper to your satisfaction?**\n\nIf so, we will update the rebuttal later in the rebuttal period with results.\n\nIf not, what additional simulated experiments would you like to see?\n\n> How does the system handle noisy data or incomplete point clouds, common in real-world scenarios?\n\nOur method can be trained on partial/occluded point clouds - for instance, in our Real World experiment (Section 6.2), we do use four cameras, but they do not see the entire mug. There is no fundamental reason why the method shouldn\u2019t work under noise/occlusion - the RelDist representation is still valid under those circumstances. However, the training procedure would need to incorporate that distribution (we already have a synthetic occlusion data augmentation, and could feasibly incorporate a viewpoint dropout or noise augmentation).\n\n> Could the authors elaborate on potential strategies for overcoming the limitations related to symmetric objects or multimodal placements?\n\nThere are two potential approaches we have considered. The first is empirical symmetry-breaking, similar to what we use in the Bottle/Bowl experiments. You could \u201cpaint\u201d each object with a feature field which breaks the symmetry - this painting could be learned generatively to flexibly represent the set - and could be consistent across the class. In this way, the learned kernel function would be able to break the symmetry unambiguously. Precisely formulating this learning process is on our roadmap for future work.\n\nThe second is analytical, similar to https://openreview.net/forum?id=psyvs5wdAV which enumerates the symmetry group for each object category. With this privileged information, you could assign the supervision target to be a specific canonical element of that symmetry group (i.e. the RelDist for a particular rotation of a symmetric cube), even if the demonstration is a different element of that group, and transform the predicted canonical representation into the group element seen at training time (to make the losses consistent). However, this requires a lot of assumptions, including the existence of a consistent symmetry group across a class (may not be true, i.e. some bottles are symmetric, some are not)."

To summarize, our method achieves very high levels of precision (<1.25 degrees of rotational error, <2mm of translational error on average) on every task, which is within the tolerance margin for successful predictions for each task. The baseline we compare against, TAX-Pose, does not achieve this level of precision at convergence.\n\nGiven that our method achieves a high degree of precision on these 5 new high-precision tasks (and provides a more complete evaluation of the method), would you consider increasing your score?"

We wanted to provide a final update, including a new set of requested experiments and updates to our manuscript.\n\n# New Experiments\n\nDuring the rebuttal period, we performed the following experiments:\n\n* We evaluated our method on a new set of 5 precise placement tasks from the RLBench task suite. We found that our method achieves **substantially higher precision** than the closest baseline, TAX-Pose. We believe that this is strong evidence of our method\u2019s suitability for precise placement tasks.\n\n* We have performed an additional **sample efficiency** ablation. See our second post above, entitled \u201cNew experiment: Strong sample efficiency for learning precise placement\u201d. We find that our method is able to learn a highly-precise relationship from only a single demonstration, and uniformly achieves higher precision-per-sample than TAX-Pose.\n\n# Manuscript Revisions\n\nWe have made the following changes to the manuscript:\n\n* Added a new experiment subsection, which describes the RLBench suite of tasks and presents our main results and includes some visualizations of the task.\n* Added the new sample efficiency ablation\n* Created a new original figure illustrating relative placement for the Problem Statement section.\n\n**Overall, we hope we have addressed the majority of the reviewers\u2019 concerns about our experiments section. We believe that our revised manuscript is substantially stronger with the addition of RLBench experiments and analysis.**"
