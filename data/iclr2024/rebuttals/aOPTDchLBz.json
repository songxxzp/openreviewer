I further agree with claim that the contribution of such a dataset is of profound importance to research in Hebrew ASR and to the development of strong speech products for Hebrew.  Specific strengths include:\n\n- The dataset is indeed under a permissive license.\n- The dataset includes speakers of many ages and include speakers with other first languages representing the diversity of Hebrew speakers as a whole.\n- The settings from which the data is reported to have been gathered reflect realistic applications of Hebrew ASR."

However, I believe that the write-up is missing a few things that users will need and will expect to find in a paper that introduces a dataset.\n\n(1) Details on how the dataset is split across speakers and domains.  To whatever degree is possible, information on how much of the data came from speakers in different age groups, speakers with different first languages, and settings (podcasts, lectures, talmud lessons, ect.)\n\n(2) Details on the automatic transcription.  How much of the 10k hours are transcribed?  How good is the transcription? Even a WER on a very small (maybe 30mins?), manually transcribed test split would be helpful as evidence that the transcriptions are strong enough to be usable.\n\n(3) Baseline models.  How does a conventional RNN-T or LAS model perform when trained on the supervised subset?  How about when it is then finetuned using the untranscribed subset, or rescored with a language model?\n\nFor an example of a classic and very useful paper of this kind, I direct the authors to the original Librispeech write-up: https://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf"

As such it is not well suited to ICLR - a conference like Interspeech or LREC with a track for language resources would be more appropriate.\nEven for a speech or language resources conference, it would be desirable to have more details on the actual corpus, such as quantitative information about language/accent distribution. \nLastly, the corpus would be much more valuable if some amount of human annotation were included. Automatic transcription contains errors, and especially systems like Whisper are known to hallucinate. These errors will be propagated if users of this corpus use the transcripts for further model training. Automatic transcription is easy to generate, but manual transcription is difficult and costly -- it would have been a great service to the community to include even a few hours of manual transcripts."

However, you do seem to know that speakers range between 20 and 90 years. If this information is available, why can't a distribution over age ranges be provided? It would be good to see the distribution over ages, accents, and other languages, even if based on automatic classifiers."

It is provided in three different forms: raw unprocessed audio, data post-Voice Activity Detection, and partially transcribed data.

                    "value": "The primary concern with the paper is its narrow focus on Hebrew ASR dataset. Given the diverse range of topics covered at ICLR, which includes machine learning, representation learning, and various other areas, a paper solely dedicated to a specific language may struggle to attract a broad audience. The conference typically prioritizes research with broader applicability and impact across multiple domains. Although the paper addresses the need for extensive and high-quality resources for Hebrew ASR, the impact beyond the Hebrew language itself seems limited. While Hebrew is a unique language with its own complexities, the specific challenges faced in Hebrew ASR may not resonate with researchers working on other languages or broader speech recognition topics. This lack of broader impact may further diminish the paper's appeal to the ICLR audience. I suggest the authors submit the paper to specific workshop or speech conference.\n\n Another concern is the absence of baseline numbers with well-established open-source frameworks such as ESPnet, k2, and fairseq. Others could easily build their system and have a relatively fair comparision if these numbers are provided."
