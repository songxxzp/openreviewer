This deviates from conventional image-captioning tasks, bringing a distinct complexity to our work. Our approach is specifically designed to model this complexity, **addressing the particular task-driven relationships between texts and images**. Furthermore, **hateful content is a widespread phenomenon on social media, making the task's scope significant and relevant**. Existing methods of image-text matching or multimodal content understanding often struggle with such tasks, highlighting the importance and novelty of our approach. **We also test our improved model on other datasets and tasks after the paper submission and achieve promising results**, which will be released in later studies. \n\n\n> Too few datasets are used for evaluation: only two while there are several meme datasets (Memotion7k, MultiOFF, Harm-C, Harm-P, etc.\n\nRegarding the concern about the datasets, it is important to emphasize that **these two datasets are widely used benchmarks in the field, especially that the English one serves as the most authentic and only dataset used in many existing studies**. We use them to ensure the reliability and generalizability of our results, where conducting experiments on less popular or unverified datasets might lead to less credible outcomes. Furthermore, **our study specifically targets the most extensively used languages on social media\u2014English and Chinese**. The promising results achieved by our approach on these datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to processing different languages. However, we will also consider including results from more appropriate datasets and even tasks to further demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.\n\n\n> The paper's contribution is well-motivated but not concretely declared as bullet points in the last part of introduction (probably due to space restrictions) which would be very helpful to several readers.\n> The methodology is clearly presented and the notation is suitable. I would only demand more rigor through providing the dimensionality of all symbols. Q1: Why perform random sampling to produce x_m? Wouldn't be the same to average the N' first vectors? Please motivate your choice. Q2: In rejection sampling, it is unclear why should the average memory vector be equal to the vector of highest reward. Maybe I have missed something. Answer to Q1 & Q2: The randomness is necessary to obtain x_m^*. The process is done for each (I,X) pair, so after it the best memory vector is obtained.

LLMs are missing and the meme literature while sufficient is described only in very high level.\n> Minor issue with respect to terminology: I suggest to use multimodal LLMs instead of plain LLMs to avoid confusion.\n\nThanks for the suggestions on the paper presentation, including the way to present our contributions, the way to obtain x_m^*, more discussions on related work, as well as the terminology of multimodal LLMs, we will address them in the final version of the paper.\n\n> Can one gain any explainability with regards to the memory module? What does it actually learn? It seems like a black box that has been named memory module and untenably attributed with correlation-extracting functionality.\n\nRegarding the questions about the memory module, it is specifically designed to **capture vital information, namely the correlation between visual and textual features that contribute to the identification of hateful memes**. This is achieved through a memory matrix composed of N vectors, where each vector represents a potential aspect that lead to hateful information. \n\n> No limitations of this work are provided, including for instance the compute requirements both for training and inference compared with the competing SotA methods for the task.\n\nRegarding the concerns about limitations of this work and computation requirements, **we find that our model's resource consumption is similar to those models of comparable scale**. Although our training process incorporates an extra self-rejection process, which is not required during inference, the entire process still allows our approach to run efficiently. Importantly, the self-rejection training is able to be conducted independently of the main model training, meaning it does not impose additional resource demands from the primary pipeline. As for other limitations, we will discuss them in the final version of our paper."

As there is no introduction about its optimization, I assume they are updated in each iteration by BP. Therefore, the modules suffer from limited novelty. In addition, current introduction cannot reflect why they are memories? What does the matrix memorized? The operations in Cross-modal Memorizing looks like attention mechanisms with visual and text features as inputs.\n\n2)The authors should discuss differences between self-rejection training and previous methods. Current introduction makes it looks like standard contrastive learning\u3002\n\nOther issues:\n\n1)From Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, it is insufficient to observe complementarities or contradictions between image and text. The authors should present more examples to demonstrate effectiveness.\n\n2)Fig. 2 is somewhat complicated and confusing. I suggest the authors present HMD and self-rejection training by different figures.\n\n3)The experiments can be further improved. First, the baseline performance without LLM should present in main manuscript. Second, the right column of Table 3 should be removed. The improvements seem minor. Third, from Table 5, it seems that memory module is actually co-attention mechanism. There are only ablation study for the proposed methods. The authors should present some analyse experiments, e.g., compare self-rejection training with similar methods, influences caused by different prompts."

                        "value": "Thank you so much for your detailed comments and suggestions; we address the key concerns in the following texts and will include necessary supplements and modifications in the final version of the paper.\n\n>Although taking LLM for HMD is interesting, the overall methods somewhat lack novelty.\n1)The memory module is designed as a matrix. As there is no introduction about its optimization, I assume they are updated in each iteration by BP. Therefore, the modules suffer from limited novelty. In addition, current introduction cannot reflect why they are memories? What does the matrix memorized? The operations in Cross-modal Memorizing looks like attention mechanisms with visual and text features as inputs.\n2)The authors should discuss differences between self-rejection training and previous methods. Current introduction makes it looks like standard contrastive learning\n\nRegarding the concerns of novelty, we propose **a reinforcement learning-manner** approach via self-rejection training, which enhances our approach by **learning the task-specific information** and guides it to better understand the relationships between text and images in HMD. To our knowledge, this is the first study that adopt LLM to leverage the capability of LLM and combine it with task-specific information through self-rejection training. Additionally, **we utilize generative large language models (LLMs) for understanding tasks**, a domain where LLMs generally are hard to perform well, especially with \"unmatching\" text and image pairs. This application showcases the innovativeness of this work, leveraging LLMs in a challenging and novel context.\n\n>From Fig. 1 and Fig. 4, it is insufficient to observe complementarities or contradictions between image and text. The authors should present more examples to demonstrate effectiveness.\n\nRegarding the concern about Figures 1 and 4, in addition to the figures in the current paper, **we prepare a more comprehensive set of examples and plan to include them in the final version of the paper**. These additional examples better illustrate the intricacies of how our approach effectively discerns the complementarities and contradictions between the visual and textual components of memes. \n\n>Fig. 2 is somewhat complicated and confusing. I suggest the authors present HMD and self-rejection training by different figures.\n\nThanks for the suggestions on Figure 2, we will improve it in the final version of the paper.\n\n>The experiments can be further improved. First, the baseline performance without LLM should present in main manuscript. \n\nRegarding the concerns for the experiments, for the baseline performance without LLM, we do not include it in the main manuscript due to space limitation. We will add it to the  paper in its final version. \n\n>Second, the right column of Table 3 should be removed. The improvements seem minor. \n\nFor Table 3, thanks for your suggestions, we will make necessary adjustments. For the improvement, we assess the significance of the improvements via t-test at p<0.05 level and **find them are significant**. Meanwhile, **such performance gain is similar in previous studies**, which adequately proves the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n>Third, from Table 5, it seems that memory module is actually co-attention mechanism. There are only ablation study for the proposed methods. The authors should present some analyse experiments, e.g., compare self-rejection training with similar methods, influences caused by different prompts.\n\nFor the differences between the memory module and co-attention mechanism, **the memory module in our approach is designed to specifically capture correlations between visual and textual features in hateful memes**. The memory module includes a list of memory vectors, each targeting a potential aspect of hateful content. In contrast, co-attention mechanisms, commonly used in tasks like image captioning, **focus on aligning and fusing multimodal features to model shared semantics**. This fundamental difference in focus and function results in our memory module being more effective for the specific task of HMD. \n\nFor more ablation studies, since our approach emphasizes learning task-specific information, **there are limited existing models for a direct comparison with our self-rejection training approach**. Nonetheless, we try new improvements after the paper submission and achieve promising results, which will be released in later studies."

With no additional components such as cross-model memorization, can we show if LLMs have the capability of predicting the hatefulness of memes?\n\nRegarding the concerns about using LLMs in detecting the hatefulness of memes, our base model in the experiments employs a fine-tuned LLM, **which demonstrates the capability of LLMs in hateful meme detection**. However, it is also important to note that while LLMs are capable in this task, **the performance of our proposed approach surpasses that of the base LLM model**. This distinction underlines the enhancements our method offers over the standard LLM approach, thereby reinforcing the significance and contribution of our work.\n\n\n>Additionally, in section 2.2 (reward model training), the method to create the positive and negative samples is unclear. Can we elaborate on it?\n\nRegarding the creation of positive and negative samples for reward model training in Section 2.2 of the paper, the process is described as follows.  \n**Positive Samples**: these are **directly selected from the training data**. An instance, which is an image-text pair (denoted as I_r ,X_r ), is randomly chosen from the training data and treated as a positive sample. This means that **the instance is already associated with HMD**, making it relevant for the task.  \n**Negative Samples**: to create negative samples, **a caption $C_r$ is generated for the image in the positive sample instance**. This caption is then combined with the image $I_r$ to form a new instance ($I_r$ ,$C_r$), which serves as the negative sample. This approach assumes that the newly generated caption, when paired with the image, **does not carry the hateful meme context**, thus making it irrelevant or negative for the HMD task.\n\n\n>Why do we restrict the proposed approach to only detect the hatefulness of memes? Why not use it for a broad range of meme understanding tasks such as harmfulness detection, offensiveness detection, etc.?\n\nRegarding the application of our proposed approach to HMD, it's primarily driven by the unique challenge presented by this particular scenario. Different from standard image-captioning tasks where there is a direct match between the text and image, **hateful meme analysis often involves dealing with content where the text and image may not necessarily align**. This mismatch brings a distinctive barrier to the task, **making it an interesting and challenging task**. Our approach is specifically designed to model this unique aspect of image-text pair. While this paper emphasizes HMD, it is important to note that **our approach is not limited to this task** alone. We conduct experiments in harmfulness detection in Chinese and report the results in our paper, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in other scenarios as well. Additionally, we test improved versions of our approach on other datasets and tasks and plan to report the results later. Since the content of these studies is still undergoing, we do not to include those results in the discussion."

It seems being crucial for comprehending of the work.\n\nRegarding the term \"reward score,\" **it is synonymous with \"score\" in this context**. This terminology aligns with the usage in LLaMA-2. We will explain this in the final version of the paper.\n\n> As I understand, SRJ is introduced to train the memory vectors, there is no clarification regarding the baseline \u2018+SRJ\u2019 without memory module. It would be helpful if the author could also provide an explanation for \u2018+M\u2019. What is the ablation way to update memory vectors without SRJ?\n\nRegrading the concerns about the details of the baseline, for \"+SRT\", we directly use self-rejection sampling to enhance the base models by concatenating visual and text features (i.e., $x_{vt}$) to form the correlation vector (i.e., $x_{m}$), and randomly set 33% values in $x_{m}$ to zero to facilitate self-rejection training. And for \"+M\", it uses visual information encoding, cross-modal memorizing, and LLM prompting (i.e., the process in Section 2.1) and **the memory is optimized by the cross-entropy loss from comparing the model prediction and the gold standard for the task**.\n\n> What are the value of N\u2019 and M in Sec 2.1 :: Cross-modal Memorizing and the value of \u2018T\u2019 in Sec 2.2::Rejection Sampling. Is there an impact on the efficiency of the proposed approach based on these values?\n\nRegarding the impact of variables N', M, and T, we configure N' to 100 for the HMC dataset and 75 for the Memeplate dataset. For both M and T, we consistently set their values to 20 and 4, respectively, across both datasets. Concerning efficiency, as these values are relatively small and the time complexity of performing sampling is O(1), **we do not notice any substantial increase in the running time of our model**.\n\n>Within the cross-modal memorizing module, the direct concatenation of visual and text embeddings for comparison with the memory vectors may not efficiently capture cross-modal information. Therefore, the size of the memory vectors, M, becomes crucial. It would be beneficial to include an ablation study on the memory vector size to gain further insights.\n\nRegarding the ablation on the memory vector size, we conduct experiments to assess how varying the number of memory vectors (denoted as N) affects performance and present the results in Section 4.2. We observe that **with a small N, the model's performance enhances as N increases**. However, **once N surpasses a certain threshold, further increases in N yield negligible improvements**. We run similar experiments with variable M and **obtain similar results**.\n\n\n> In the HMC dataset, 10% are unimodal hateful examples. So the <image, caption> pair could be hateful, do you have insights on why this may not adversely affect the model\u2019s performance?\n\nRegarding the impact of unimodal hateful examples, since **their presence in the dataset is limited** (only 10%), the potential negative effects are not much. Since the majority of the data (90%) is not in unimodal hateful cases, it reduces the overall impact of unimodal hateful content.\n\n\n> Minor issues: 1). The Figure 2 can be improved by adding explanation for the various arros and lines at the bottom. And consider using different color to distinguish between different modules. 2). Typo in Table 7, MHC\u2192 HMC. 3). For the HMC dataset, the label for each split have been made available at: https://hatefulmemeschallenge.com/# . Additionally, the \u2018Test\u2019 column in Table 3 could be removed if the authors cannot find the GT labels.\n\nRegarding other issues related to figures, typos, and datasets, thanks for pointing them out. We will address them in the final version of the paper."
