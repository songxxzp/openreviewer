                        "value": "Thank you for your careful assessment of our paper and the positive feedback you mentioned as strengths. You raise three concerns related to (a) details on the model, (b) learning rate for stimulus optimization and (c) stimulus normalization details, and two questions (1. + 2.), which we are happy to clarify below. As these concerns seemed rather minor and related to presentation, we were somewhat surprised by the low score. Please let us know whether our following answers address your concern and consider updating your score accordingly. If you have remaining concerns, please let us know what we should do to address them.\n\n- a. The models are convolutional neural networks in the well-established core-readout architecture (Klindt et al., NeurIPS 2017; Lurz et al., ICLR 2021) trained from scratch (no pre-training) on neural responses to images/videos. The detailed parameters vary from dataset to dataset and have been optimized by the authors of previous papers to maximize the predictive power of the models on the respective datasets (mouse retina: H\u00f6fling et al. bioRxiv 2022; macaque V4: Willeke et al, bioRxiv 2023; marmoset retina: work soon to be submitted). We will include an appendix that describes the technical details of the models.\n\n- b. The learnable parameters are the pixel values of the maximally discriminable images/video segments, while the network weights are treated as fixed and not being optimized. The high learning rate is typical for pre-image search problems like activity maximization and has been selected as the best one from within the range we explored (10^-3 to 10^3). We will add this information to the paper.\n\n- c. The normalization is done because neural responses usually increase with the contrast of the input, but the monitor that displayed the digital twin\u2019s training videos has a finite dynamic range. If we had not constrained the overall energy of the stimuli, the optimized MDS would show an unrealistically high contrast that cannot be displayed by the monitor. This procedure is typical in activity maximization settings (e.g. Walker et al., Nature Neuroscience 2019; Hoefling et al., bioRxiv 2022; Willeke et al, bioRxiv 2023). Even with constraining the L2 norm, single pixels can still exceed the monitor range, which is why we clipped them. The provided intervals correspond to the minimum (UV: -0.913, green: -0.654) and maximum (UV and green: 6.269) light intensity of the monitor, respectively, whereas zero corresponds to the mean luminance across the stimuli. The intervals are asymmetric, because the distribution of light intensities in the stimuli is skewed. We will add this additional information to the paper.\n\n1. The digital twin models were trained from scratch on neural responses by authors of previous papers. See answer to a.\n\n2. The three hyperparameters of the method are learning rate, number of initial clusters, and temperature (Eq. 1). The learning rate affects primarily the runtime of the optimization procedure, not the resulting optimal stimuli. We verified that the results are robust with respect to different initializations and number of initial clusters (mouse retina: adjusted rand index ARI=0.87 (page 7) and compare Figure 2A to Appendix Figure 7; marmoset retina: ARI=0.49 (p. 8) and compare Figure 4A to Appendix Figure 8; macaque V4: ARI=0.53 (p. 8) and compare Figure 5 to Appendix Figure 9). The temperature determines how strongly we penalize larger cluster responses. We explored various temperatures in early tests and 1.6 worked well, and we will now run a control where we examine it more systematically and report the results."

I'm still confused in the experiment setting \"we split cells into a set of 80% used during clustering and report results on the remaining held-out test set\".  Since the method is an unsupervised learning algorithm, why not directly apply it to the full set of neurons and report the results of clustering? How would it be used in a practical application when there are no reference/ground truth functional types? Can the data used for training the digital twin be used for such functional type clustering? E.g., clustering directly on the responses of the training data (used for digital twin network training)?\nThe essential prior knowledge and motivations of this work are missing and I hope the revised version can be significantly improved in such aspects for better readability."

The algorithm follows the similar way as expectation maximization (EM), start from random assignment of groups, and maximize the activation objective in M step, and then reassign groups in E step. The total number of cell type groups is not defined as a prior, depends on the coverage and threshold of the EM algorithms. The work is evaluated on multiple real datasets and different animals (mouse retina, marmoset retina, and macaque V4). The proposed method is also helpful to provide time-efficient cell type identification."

We are happy to provide a baseline, but are unsure what you meant. How would you suggest to search for maximally discriminative stimuli by nearest neighbor search or image/video interpolation? Our goal is to find groups of neurons and corresponding stimuli that discriminate between these groups by maximizing/minimizing neural responses. What images/video would we use to start the nearest neighbor search and how would finding nearest neighbors of images lead to clusters of neurons?\n\nRegarding your concerns on the method:\n\n1. You are right that discreteness is an underlying assumption. We consider this a feature rather than a problem: the motivation for developing our method was to be able to address the biological question whether neurons form discrete cell types that can be distinguished based on their functional properties. To answer this biological question, we need methods and models that capture certain underlying structural properties. Pitting such models against each other and testing how well they explain a dataset allows us to answer this question. We feel that ICLR as a machine learning venue is the right place for such method contributions and answering the biological question is beyond the scope of this venue.\n\n2. This is a valid limitation that applies to all visualization techniques. The results indeed depend somewhat on architecture and optimizers. However, while the details differ, the features tend to be conceptually similar across hyperparameters (Walker et al., Nature Neuroscience 2019; Ustyuzhaninov et al., bioRxiv 2022, Figure 1F; Fu et al., bioRxiv 2023, Figure 2B left column). To what extent the differences are problematic depends on the underlying scientific question one tries to address. Therefore, while perfectly valid, we consider this concern to be somewhat orthogonal to the goal of our paper. We suggest adding a short discussion of this issue to the revised paper.\n\n3. You are right that it might be difficult to compare and interpret the MDS. However, keep in mind that (a) in practice one would rarely use the MDS alone to characterize a neuron and (b) the MDS are still useful even if they are not interpretable at all, because experimentalists can use them to quickly determine a neuron\u2019s type based on a small set of stimuli.\n\nRegarding evaluation: We agree that ultimately the method needs to be tested and validated in vivo. However, such experimental validation is challenging and beyond the scope of an ICLR paper where the focus is on the method development. We will add this great suggestion to the discussion of our paper.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1. Whether and how these clusters relate to excitatory vs. inhibitory cell types is an interesting question, but cannot be addressed with these datasets. The mouse retina dataset contains some displaced amacrine cells, but we restricted our analysis to the most widely available cell types in the dataset, which were all ganglion cells and, hence, excitatory. In the marmoset retina, we expect only ganglion cells. In the monkey V4 dataset we do not have information on cell types as they were recorded with extracellular multi-electrode recordings. We will revise the dataset description to mention this, accordingly.\n\n2. The off-diagonal entries show that not all functional clusters can be separated perfectly by the method. This can be for two main reasons: (a) some cell types may not be identifiable by a single image/video (e.g. ON-OFF cells), which is a limitation of our method; (b) it is still an open question in neuroscience whether there are discrete cell types or whether there is a continuum of functional properties. Our method may contribute to answering this important and challenging question, but - as discussed above - actually answering the question is beyond the scope of an ICLR paper and ICLR is not the right venue for this."

The authors' new results on another digital twin model have partly addressed my concerns about **dependence on model choices**.  While I still encourage investigations on more diverse results from models trained with different architectures, objective functions, tasks, and learning rules in the future. \n\n2. The authors correctly understand my proposed naive baseline - search instead of optimization for a maximally discriminative video snippet in the dataset, which might provide more interpretability as visualization in original image space rather than feature space. My concerns about this missing baseline have been addressed by the explanation of its limited performance, the small dataset size, and the time complexity of the exhaustive search. It would still be helpful if other stronger baselines were compared as Reviewer FrCb mentioned.\n\n3. I am not fully convinced by the clarification of the discreteness hypothesis and adding biological insights is beyond the scope of ICLR. Is it possible to project MDS into a continuous space, and visualize the continuity and discreteness at the same time (i.e. whether there is a clear clustering pattern)? For example, boundary cells might raise an interesting point about the existence of **a continuum of functional properties** as the authors mentioned.\n\n4. I agree with the authors' points that it could easily quickly determine a neuron\u2019s type as the authors mentioned, while I think improving the lack of interpretability in MDS is still valuable."

This approach is successful across species and recording techniques and provides real-time cell type assignment, making experiments more efficient.

For instance, for ON-OFF RGCs that respond to both light increments and decrements, optimizing a single, short MDS to maximize their response may not adequately capture their unique properties. Similarly, for cell types like \"OFF suppressed 2,\" which exhibit a high baseline firing rate mostly suppressed by stimulation, the algorithm may not effectively identify them without specific adaptations, potentially requiring additional stimulus optimization strategies for better classification.\n\nThe absence of a benchmark is a significant weakness in this paper.

                        "value": "Thank you for thoroughly reviewing our paper. We believe that some of your concerns might be based on a misunderstanding of the state of the field in neuroscience, but of course it is equally possible that we misunderstood your concerns. So please let us know if the explanations below address your concerns and consider updating your score.\n\n\nYou point out the absence of empirical results (first question) and a benchmark (third question) as significant concerns, but we are unsure if we understand your suggestion correctly: For mouse retinal ganglion cells, Baden et al. (2016) established functional types based on a variety of functional and morphological properties. We tested our algorithm on a dataset labeled with those types and demonstrated good agreement of our clustering algorithm to the Baden et al. (2016) cell types (see first part of the Results and Figure 2). These results were empirically obtained on real retina responses and, in our opinion, represent exactly the benchmark you were asking for. Hence, we are unsure if we understood your main concern correctly. Could you clarify if this resolves your concern and what you suggest we do to increase the score you rated our paper with?\n\n\nRegarding your other questions and concerns:\n\n\n1. Limitations: We agree that our algorithm is limited in distinguishing certain types with complex responses, e.g. ON-OFF cells from ON or OFF cells, which is why we discuss it explicitly in the discussion. Every method has limitations, including alternative methods that address similar problems (Ustyuzhaninov et al., bioRxiv 2022; Willeke et al., bioRxiv 2023). Note that ours is the first that has actually been validated on empirical data where something akin to biological ground truth exists (Baden et al. 2016). Beyond the retina (i.e. in visual cortex), we simply do not know whether functional types exist and, if so, how to identify them. Closing this gap is the key motivation behind our paper and, hence, an important contribution even if it has limitations. For sure, some of these limitations can be addressed, e.g. by extending our algorithm to generate multiple stimuli per cluster. Such improvements are interesting avenues for future work but beyond the scope of the current paper.\n\n2. Domain specific knowledge: You are completely right - leveraging domain knowledge is of course helpful if it exists. In later processing stages such as V4, however, we simply do not know that much. In such situations we believe our approach is advantageous because it is still applicable. It is important to realize that one important use case of our method is to facilitate scientific discovery, i.e. specifically situations where the domain knowledge does not yet exist. We will improve the paper to more clearly discuss this.\n\n3. Regarding the availability of digital twin models: Please note that the digital twin is needed only to find out what the cell types are. An important use case of our method is to quickly assign neurons to already identified types. In this situation, only the MDS are needed, but no digital twin. We will revise the paper to mention this explicitly."

After carefully considering your explanations, I would like to discuss certain points further.\n\nFirstly, I appreciate the clarification on the empirical results and benchmarking. It is indeed valuable that you tested your algorithm on a dataset labeled with functional types from Baden et al. (2016), demonstrating good agreement in the clustering. This information was not explicitly highlighted in the initial paper, and I believe including these details in the Results section and Figure 2 strengthens your case. However, it might be beneficial to emphasize this point more prominently in the manuscript to ensure readers easily grasp the empirical validation aspect.\n\nConcerning the limitations, I understand that every method has its constraints, and it's positive that you openly acknowledge them in the discussion. The comparison to alternative methods, such as Ustyuzhaninov et al. (bioRxiv 2022) and Willeke et al. (bioRxiv 2023), adds context to your work. I suggest reinforcing this comparison and explicitly stating how your method stands out in terms of empirical validation and applicability in situations where domain knowledge is limited. Additionally, your proposed future improvements, such as extending the algorithm to generate multiple stimuli per cluster, could be briefly outlined as avenues for addressing some of the identified limitations.\n\nRegarding domain-specific knowledge, I appreciate your perspective on the applicability of your approach in situations where limited knowledge exists. Emphasizing this point in the manuscript, perhaps in the Introduction or Methodology sections, will help readers understand the unique contribution your method makes in scenarios with sparse domain knowledge.\n\nFinally, your clarification on the digital twin models is helpful. Clearly stating in the paper that the digital twin is only needed for identifying cell types, while the MDS alone suffices for assigning neurons to identified types, will improve the paper's clarity.\n\nIn summary, I suggest incorporating these additional details and emphases into the manuscript to enhance its overall clarity and strengthen the case for your method. I appreciate your responsiveness to my feedback and look forward to the revised version of your paper."

This seems to be a newly initialized, separately trained MDS which does not necessarily tell whether the sub-clusters are bringing in better cell type identification. I hope the authors can explain more about the logic of this.\n2. Can the authors elaborate more on Figure 2B? They referenced figure 2B when stating in the text that \u201cnone of the MDS exhibited direction selectivity\u201d, but I didn\u2019t quite understand why Figure 2B is referenced here.\n3. For the experiments in Figure 2, the identified MDS seems to be largely combination of several functional cell types from the published Baden et al (2016) paper. I wonder if further tweaking with the sub-clustering procedure can better recover the published functional cell types.\n4. How will the result change if the number of gradient ascent steps is changed during each M-step? Trying to understand if there is a delicate balance needed between how well the M-step is optimized and the E-step, or if the procedure is relatively robust and almost guaranteed to converge to the same set of results."

                        "value": "Thank you for your encouraging feedback on our paper. We would like to start by addressing your main concerns about usefulness in practice and interpretability of the method. Please let us know if this addresses your concern or what you believe we should do or demonstrate to increase your score.\n\nRegarding usefulness: As you state correctly, we used the cell types by Baden et al. (2016) to show our algorithm\u2019s effectiveness. However, your assumption that the same biological baselines exist in a lot of real scenarios is not true. Beyond the retina (i.e. in visual cortex), it is not known if cells can be clustered into functional types and, we do not know how many types exist. Additionally, it is not clear how exactly to identify them because the method used by Baden et al. (2016) does not generalize to visual cortex. Closing this gap is the key motivation behind our paper: Our clustering approach finds optimal stimuli to determine functional types and assigns neurons quickly to their type.\n\nRegarding interpretability: Currently there exist no experimentally validated methods. The methods that do exist use either in-silico experiments with simple, classical stimuli (Ustyuzhaninov et al., bioRxiv 2022; but this approach does not generalize to lesser known areas such as V4) or similarity of single cell maximally exciting images (Willeke et al, bioRxiv 2023). In contrast to these approaches, our method offers the added value that the stimuli we obtain are not only highly activating, but actually visually what feature a cell type \u201cspecializes\u201d on that other cell types do not respond to. Thus, our method offers potential to drive the field forward exploring functional cell types for many real world scenarios where no clustering baselines exist (e.g. Ustyuzhaninov et al., bioRxiv 2022; Willeke et al, bioRxiv 2023).\n\nWe will revise the paper to discuss these points more clearly.\n\nRegarding your questions:\n\n1. After running EM clustering on the sub-cluster split, we evaluated if splitting improves overall clustering. Therefore, we kept neuron\u2019s assignments to the main clusters and new sub-cluster candidates, but randomly initialized the stimulus associated with each of them. Next, we optimized the MDS for all these clusters and re-assigned neurons based on the optimized MDS. Now, neuron assignments and MDS reflected the overall clustering state - including the subclusters - which allowed us to precisely estimate if splitting improved overall clustering. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n2. We agree, in the first principle component (Figure 2B) direction selectivity cannot be examined. The digital twin model (H\u00f6fling et al. bioRxiv 2022) used space-time separated convolution learning a time-trace and spatial filter independently (similar as depicted in Figure 2B), and hence was not able to learn direction selectivity. We apologize for referencing Figure 2B for such claims and will revise the paper accordingly.\n\n3. Baden et al. (2016) relied on functional responses to chirp and moving bar stimuli and morphological properties. As the digital twin cannot model direction selectivity or morphological properties, we removed these features from the classifier that was used to label our dataset, showing degraded separability across the types reported in Baden et al. (2016) (Figure 2E). Hence, the digital twin lacking these features poses a limit on the granularity of our clusters. \n\n4. In the M-step we optimize MDS until the objective does not change significantly anymore to yield stable evaluations of our objective (Eq. 1). During algorithm development for the mouse retina data we verified sufficient training steps were performed by inspecting the objective values across steps. For marmoset and monkey V4 data, we automatically checked for convergence: we stopped MDS optimization if an exponential moving average of the objective did not increase anymore for 100 optimization steps and verified from the objective values across optimization steps that this stopping criterion led to a reasonably converged objective. We now have realized this information was not clearly mentioned throughout the paper, which we will revise accordingly."
