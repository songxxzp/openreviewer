To ensure that the forward and backward embeddings are consistent with each other, they used an additional loss to enforce that the relative distance between two architectures in the forward embedding space and the backward embedding space is similar.\n\n They report the results on NasBench-101, NasBench-201 and Darts search space.

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The novelty of this work is somewhat limited as its really only using a dual encoder with adjacency matrix transpose, while components like the IGR loss are heavily borrowed from different work.\n\nThis work only considers experiments on cell-based NAS Benchmarks but not on real NAS problems, which are outperformed by macro-based NAS structures like Once-for-All/MobileNets/EfficientNets. Also, no search is applied and no found architectures are evaluated. \n\nThere are probably simpler ways to consider the backwards-pass representation of a NAS DAG which this paper does not consider. The trivial method would be to simply cast the DAG as a fully-directed graph (for every edge (i, j), add edge (j, i)) and still use a simpler encoder. Another way, also simpler than this would be to consider weighted edges, e.g., forward-pass edges have weight '1', backwards-pass have weight '-1', and you use torch.nn.GINEConv instead of torch.nn.GINConv. \n\nThe IGR loss in this paper is somewhat counter-intuitive. The intuition behind considering the transposed adjacency matrix is that you are providing the predictor with new information not found in the forward-pass adj. matrix. This information should allow the predictor to learn a better understanding of architecture performance, which would help performance. Under this assumption, you would expect the encodings of the forward encode and backwards encoder to probably be different as they should be learning on distinct information, and that the concatenation of that information (graph embeddings from each encoder) benefits predictor performance. Instead, the IGR loss is counter to this as it forces both the forward/backwards encoders to 'learn the same thing' using different views of the same data. In other words, in Figs 2-3, showing how the IRG matrix values goes down with the addition of the loss and more samples seems counter-intuitive.\n\nAnalysis in Figures 2 and 3 is missing NAS-Bench-201 using the IGR loss, NAS-Bench-301 400 samples with the loss, even though the manuscript is not even 9 pages.\n\nAuthor's mention Graph Attention Networks (GAT) a few times in the paper, but do not use them to perform any analysis on their encoders, e.g., highlighting the nodes/edges assigned high attention scores. This would be a good way to highlight how their method learns and the benefits of their design, and rebut the hypothesis that FR-NAS outperforms NPNAS and NPENAS simply because the predictor has more parameters.\n\nThere are a lot of missing entries in the related work section. Some of which should be added, and compared to, e.g.,\n- TNASP [1] and PINAT [2] deal with special encodings for the adjacency matrix, like this paper.\n- CDP [3] is a cross-domain predictor which cases 201 and 301 to be like 101, to deal with limited target data like this paper.\n- GENNAPE [4] also deal with limited target data like CDP, but they also utilize a robust form of Computational Graph that covers the entire architecture, not just the NAS cell design.\n- Multi-Predict [5] show how to leverage other information like Zero-Cost Proxies [6] and device latency/FLOPs to aid prediction - both of which this paper does not acknowledge, yet it is a critical concern of NAS.\n\nFor the above reasons I would recommend rejection of this manuscript. \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Lu et al., \"TNASP: A Transformer-based NAS Predictor with a Self-Evolution Framework\", in NeurIPS 2021.\n\n[2] Lu et al., \"PINAT: A Permutation INvariance Augmented Transformer for NAS Predictor\", in AAAI-23.\n\n[3] Liu et al., \"Bridge the Gap Between Architecture Spaces via a Cross-Domain Predictor\", in NeurIPS 2022.\n\n[4] Mills et al., \"GENNAPE: Towards Generalized Neural Architecture Performance Estimators\", in AAAI-23.\n\n[5] Akhauri and Abdelfattah, \"Multi-Predict: Few Shot Predictors For Efficient Neural Architecture Search\", in AutoML Conf 2023.\n\n[6] Abdelfattah et al., \"Zero-Cost Proxies for Lightweight NAS\", in ICLR 2021."
