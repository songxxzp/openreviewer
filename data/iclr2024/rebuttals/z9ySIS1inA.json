The network contains complex-valued Morlet wavelets with tunable parameters to model the spatial and spatial-frequency properties of the input data, and learnable high-dimensional complex-valued ReLU as the nonlinear activation function. The model significantly outperform real-valued counterparts and existing complex-valued models on a variety of image classification tasks, especially under limited labeled training data settings."

CSR consists on the application of a sequence of layers composed by convolutions with Morlet filters with learnable parameters followed by a novel learnable activation function. The complex-valued coefficients obtained at each CSR layer are subsequently fed into traditional complex-valued deep learning models. Empirical findings demonstrate that the introduction of CSR can lead to improved classification performance, particularly when dealing with a limited number of training data samples."

Complex-valued machine learning models (e.g. complex-valued classifiers) are then poposed as a second stage to address the task at hand.  While the scattering network is largely designed, some of its hyperparameters are learned during training.  Furthermore, a learnable pointwise activation function is introduced, which first lifts to a higher dimensional space through a learned projection, performs a complex ReLU, before a learned down projection to the original space.  The motivation of the general approach is not simply for handling complex-valued data but rather to provide a more effective representational space, even for real-valued data.  A number of experiments are performed, both for real- and complex-valued data, demonstrating that the introduced method achieves superior performance to previous approaches.  Ablation studies to demonstrate the performance of various components are also performed."

Beyond the the usual scattering approach, an end-to-end training approach is considered, which allows some of the hyperparameters of the scattering network to be simultaneously learned (e.g. wavelet orientations and aspect ratios), along with the learned activation funcrtions.  Extensive benchmark experiments are performed, demonstrating superior performance to existing techniques.  Relatively extensive ablation studies are also presented."

A real-valued wavelet has simply been replace by a complex-valued wavelet and the non-linear activation function of the scattering network switched from a modulus to complex ReLU.  In addition, I admit the authors do introduce a learned complex ReLU.  It would also be helpful if complex ReLUs could be briefly described, either in the main body or appendix, so that the paper is self-contained.\n\nI am not convinced that the proposed complex scattering network is stable to deformations and invariant to local transformation as is claimed in the final paragraph of page 4, where it is claimed that proofs presented in prior works also hold here.  I belive the proofs of these results rely on the fact the the modulus operator adopted for the activation functions in alternative scattering networks is non-expansive.  Since the activation function is replaced with a learned complex ReLU, it is not clear to me that the resulting operator would be non-expansive.  If the authors are to claim these theoretical properties also hold for their approach then this needs to be considered in more depth.\n\nWhile learning some of the parameters of the scattering representation and the activation functions in an end-to-end training manner (as discussed in Strengths above) indeed has the advantages that a more effective representation space can be found, it has the disadvance that the computation of the scattering representation cannot be decoupled from training, resulting in training that is more computationally expensive.  This should be commented."

It is not clear to me that these results necessarily hold here.  Perhaps they do (indeed, the proposed scattering networks acheive excellent perfornace for downstream tasks, e.g. classificaiton) but if so that needs to be elaborated in greater detail.  Alternatively, this claim could also be dropped if it doesn't hold.\n\n- Is a complex encoding of real-valued data actuall necessary (as specified in Equaiton 1)?  Since a complex-valued wavelet is consided, wavelet coefficients will still be complex-valued, even if the signal/data is real.\n\n- Scattering networks were first presented in [Mallat (2012)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpa.21413), which should be made clear and the paper cited.  I believe Bruna & Mallat (2013) presented the first application of scattering networks to classification but did not introduce scattering networks per se.\n\n- The references should be reviewed to ensure reference details are up-to-date."

                    "value": "- The introduction claims current complex representations are limited to modelling the channel dimension. Why would a possibly three-dimensional complex convolutional network model, i.e. as introduced by Trabelsi et al., only model only the channel dimension? The wavelet transform is based on the convolution operation. If a fixed wavelet filter can model multichannel interactions, why can't the learnable kernels from Trabelsi et al.? \n\n- Have other existing complex activation functions, like the Hirose-activation [5], been considered?\n\n- The first sentence of the abstract promises manifold geometry and group theory. Is there some in the paper?\n\n[5] Complex-valued neural networks, A Hirose, Advances and Applications, 2013 Wiley Online Library"
