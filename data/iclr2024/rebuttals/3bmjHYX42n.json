                    "value": "The paper proposes Revision-Aware Reward Models (RARE), which leverages human revisions to strengthen alignment in the context of generative layout models for mobile screens. The authors involve expert designers in fixing layouts generated by a pretrained generative layout model and train a reward model based on how these designers revise the generated layouts. By optimizing the model using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) with the learned reward model, RARE can enhance the generative model's ability to produce modern, designer-aligned layouts. On a dataset of 276 corrected UI Layouts from designers, the authors compare the proposed method with Supervised Finetuning (SF), Preference Reward + RLHF, Chamfer Distance + RLHF, and the results show the potential of the method quantitatively and qualitatively."

                    "value": "1. The proposed method focuses on utilizing nuanced feedback, such as corrections, explanations, and reasoning, to enhance generative models. While prior works have primarily relied on high-level labels, the authors' emphasis on more involved feedback represents a novel perspective. By introducing the concept of Revision-Aware Reward Models (RARE) and applying it to generative layout models, the research offers a unique contribution to the field.\n\n2. The involvement of expert designers in fixing layouts generated by a pretrained model adds credibility to the evaluation process. The training of a reward model based on human revisions and the subsequent optimization of the generative model using reinforcement learning demonstrate a rigorous and systematic approach. The reported results strengthen the overall quality of the work.\n\n3. Overall, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. It provides a clear explanation of the research objectives and the proposed methodology. The authors effectively communicate the significance of utilizing nuanced feedback and human revisions in improving generative models."

It would benefit the research to provide an overview of the dataset, including its characteristics and why the proposed method is well-suited for this specific dataset. Additionally, to ensure the generalizability and robustness of the proposed approach, it is crucial to evaluate its performance on diverse datasets or domains. Conducting experiments with the RARE approach on different types of layouts, such as web or desktop interfaces, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its effectiveness and applicability in various contexts.\n\n2. While human revisions are utilized to train the reward model, there is a notable absence of analysis or insights into the specific patterns, reasoning, or design principles underlying these revisions. Gaining a deeper understanding of the factors driving the revisions made by human designers would offer valuable insights for further improving the generative model. Conducting a thorough analysis of the revisions, such as identifying common patterns or design choices, would enrich the understanding of the alignment between human values and generative outputs and provide guidance for refining the model's performance.\n\n3. The qualitative results presented in the paper lack detailed analysis, as only a few examples are provided. To strengthen the research, it would be beneficial to offer expert opinions and insights to support and explain why the results obtained with the RARE approach are considered good.\n\n4. Some minor typos are present in the paper, such as in section 5.2, paragraph 2, where the first sentence contains two instances of the word \"that.\""

The construction of pretraining data seems a bit too heuristic and are not grounded on any reasonable arguments/observations. Why do you assume dropping needs 1 time step, revised elements needs 2 time step, and added element needs 3 time steps? The parameters for each operation, e.g. resize 0.5-2 times have no explanation as well. \n- Limited evaluation metrics. Previous work has considered other metrics like NLL, Coverage, or Overlap.

We agree that the overarching framework of our method (diffusion models and RLHF) are similar to prior work. However, the motivation of our method is to enhance the reward model used within RLHF to take in stronger forms of feedback, such as human corrections. In addition, to our knowledge, this is first work using human feedback to improve generative layout models.\n\n**3. Reward Model Pretraining**\n\nThank you for this comment. We select these parameters heuristically, based on initial analysis of the edited dataset. For instance, removing an element is logged as 1 step. Further investigation of how best to generate pretraining data for the reward model can be useful, though we leave this to future work. We chose to pretrain the reward model to avoid overfitting to our the revision dataset.\n\n**4. Additional evaluation metrics**\n\nPlease see the above. We have included a new DocSim metric."

I did not get a full understanding of the background reading the paper because of this. Maybe the authors can reduce the size of the figures or move them to the appendix section to get more space.\n\nThe experiment aren't rigorous and the results were not analyzed properly\n- The explanation of why the Chamfer distance did worse than even the preference-based model isn't convincing. The appendix section shows that Chamfer models were trained by much more iterations in all the steps (49000 vs 2000) than all the other models, could it be just that the Chamfer model just got overfitted? To analyze the problem the author should compare chamfer vs time distance distributions and/or have more comparable training iteration numbers to start with.\n- Since the proposed approach performs similarly to the preference-based model, the authors should investigate more into this with more random seeds to start with."

Like what is done in the paper? It probably needs alignment between the human edits (which element got changed into what).\n\nI am surprised that there were no guidelines for humans who revised the layout. Have you seen any undesirable edits in the dataset?\n\nAlthough it isn't completely clear, I am assuming you are using every edit by a person on the layout as a separate edit. It might be worth clustering some of them.\n\nAccording to the description, reward model predicts the time/distance between the revisions. Does it then mean that it is a penalty model rather than a reward model?"

General methodology for RLHF**\n\nThank you for this comment. We focus specifically on text-to-layouts, which we describe in the abstract and title, but we will make this more clear in the abstract. \n\nOur work has been inspired by the general progress in the RLHF community, specifically in the works exploring different forms of human feedback. Although our method has only been applied to UI layouts and may not scale to other domains, especially high-dimensional ones such as images, we hope that training reward models on human data other than human preferences can yield promising results for RLHF. We will make clear in the revised paper that our reward model is specifically designed for the text-to-layout domain.\n\n**3. Evaluation Results**\n\nPlease see the above.\n\n**4.
