Specifically, the proposed LRM first estimates the label encodings through prediction means for unlabeled samples and then aligns them with their corresponding ground-truth label encodings. As a result, the LRM takes both the prediction discriminability and diversity into account and can be utilized as a plugin in existing models to address scenarios with insufficient labels. Theoretically, the authors analyze the relationship between the LRM and ERM."

Concretely, Figure 7 visualizes the t-SNE embeddings of the learned source and target features on the UDA task of A$\\rightarrow$D for ERM and ERM + LRM. As can be seen, compared with the ERM alone, ERM + LRM can better align the distributions across domains. Although the LRM does not directly reduce the distributional divergence between domains, it implicitly reduces the distributional divergence across domains by aligning with label encodings, leading to a better transfer performance. In addition, **we have performed some quantitative analyses, i.e., the analysis of parameter sensitivity and prediction diversity**.

A typical domain adaptation is a setting where there are no target labels at all, and the amount of labels in the source data is irrelevant. What does it mean to have insufficient labels in this situation?\n\n**AQ1**. Yes, your understanding is right. In unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no labeled data in the target domain and hence there are not enough labeled data in the target domain. In this case, we use abundant labeled data in the source domain to help learn from unlabeled data in the target domain. This setting is consistent with the label insufficient scenario, which follows [R3] and is defined in lines 5-13 of our manuscript that \"In practice, however, we often encounter some label insufficient scenarios [R3], where the labeled samples are limited or may even be absent altogether. For the former, we can utilize a large number of unlabeled samples to assist the learning of labeled samples, which falls within the scope of semi-supervised learning. On the contrary, as for the latter, a popular solution is to borrow the knowledge from a similar and label sufficient domain, i.e., source domain, for facilitating the learning of unlabeled samples, which pertains to the field of transfer learning. **The commonality of those techniques is to fully utilize unlabeled samples for improving the generalization capability in label insufficient scenarios**\".\n\n**References**\n\n[R3] Shuhao Cui, Shuhui Wang, Junbao Zhuo, Liang Li, Qingming Huang, and Qi Tian.

                        "value": "Thank you for your thoughtful review and valuable feedback. We address your concerns as follows.\n>Q1. In this paper, the core assumption is that the label encodings should remain consistent for both labeled and unlabeled samples under label insufficient scenarios. How about the performance if this assumption does not hold? In other words, if unlabeled samples have different classes or even class is unknown (All datasets of experiment have explicit classes in manuscript, such as CIFAR, Office and so on.) how we evaluate the LRM?\n\n**AQ1.** The proposed LRM is based on the assumption that label encodings should remain consistent. Based on your suggestion, we conduct experiments on Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) [R1] and Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) [R2] using the Office-31 dataset. In PDA, the categories in the target domain are a subset of those in the source one. Following [R1], the source domain has 31 categories, while the target domain includes only 10 of them. Instead, in OSDA, the categories in the source domain are a subset of those in the target one. Following [R2], the source domain contains a total of 20 shared categories, and the target domain contains all the 31 categories, making the remaining 11 categories new to the source domain. The experimental results are presented in the following Tables. In OSDA, the harmonic mean of known and unknown categories is used as the performance measure. As can be seen, the proposed LRM can improve the performance of ERM in both PDA and OSDA scenarios. So when the assumption does not hold, LRM could be effective according to the above experimental results.\n| PDA    | AtoD     | AtoW     | DtoW     | WtoD      | DtoA     | WtoA      | Average   |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| ERM     | 87.26     | 78.64     | 97.63     | 99.36      | 87.37     | 87.89     | 89.69     |\n| ERM+LRM | **89.17** | **81.69** | **98.31** | **100.00** | **90.29** | **91.23** | **91.78** |\n\n| OSDA    | AtoD      | AtoW      | DtoW      | WtoD      | DtoA      | WtoA      | Average   |\n|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| ERM     | 70.59     | 87.46     | 89.80     | 72.79     | 68.21     | 67.80     | 76.11     |\n| ERM+LRM | **75.63** | **89.44** | **92.91** | **76.57** | **69.43** | **70.13** | **79.02** |\n\n[R1] Zhangjie Cao, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, and Michael I Jordan, \u201cPartial transfer learning with selective adversarial networks,\u201d In *Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition*, pp. 2724\u20132732, 2018.\n\n[R2] Kuniaki Saito, Shohei Yamamoto, Yoshitaka Ushiku, and Tatsuya Harada.

Although, authors perform two tasks on class-imbalanced setting in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LRM. This is no theoretical guarantee on class-imbalanced supervised learning. If it exceeds the scope of this work, do we need more experiments to support the conclusion? Because, in the real world, class-imbalanced problem is pervasive.\n\n**AQ2.** Thanks for your suggestion. To further support the conclusion, we have conducted experiments involving class-imbalanced supervised learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Specifically, in the training set, we randomly choose $50$ labeled samples from each category within the last two categories, while keeping all the samples for the remaining categories. In the testing set, there are $1000$ samples per category. The experimental results are shown in Figure 5 of Appendix C.2. Note that the closer the model's predicted quantities for the last two categories are to 1000, the less it is affected by class imbalance. As shown in Figure 5(b), ERM + LRM yields higher predicted quantities for the last two categories compared to ERM alone, indicating that LRM can mitigate class imbalance in supervised learning. Moreover, the average classification accuracies of ERM and ERM + LRM are $87.13\\\\%$ and $89.41\\\\%$, respectively. Accordingly, ERM + LRM outperforms ERM by $2.28\\\\%$, showing the effectiveness of LRM in class-imbalanced supervised learning. Hence, compared with ERM, ERM + LRM is less susceptible to the impact of class imbalance in this dataset.\n\n>Q3.In Figure 2(a), please give the detailed explanation why the accuracy of ERM is fluctuant while that of ERM+LRM is not. It is hard to understand.\n\n**AQ3.** We are sorry for this confusion. In ERM of SHDA, we utilize all labeled samples from both domains to train a neural network. However, **we note that the distributions across source and target domains differ significantly. Also, the number of labeled samples in the target domain is extremely limited**. Accordingly, using ERM alone may not be able to achieve relatively stable performance on unlabeled target samples. We will add the explanation in the revision."

                        "value": "Thank you for your thoughtful review and valuable feedback. We address your concerns as follows.\n>W1. The author primarily proves and experiments with methods in label insufficient scenarios. However, in real-world situations, many data exhibit a long-tail (class-imbalanced) distribution. Can this proposed method be applied to class-imbalanced supervised and semi-supervised scenarios?\n\n**AW1.** In Appendix C.2 of our manuscript, we have conducted experiments on SHDA and SSL tasks under the class-imbalanced setting. The effectiveness of the proposed LRM in class-imbalanced scenarios can be verified.\n\nHere, we conduct further experiments of class-imbalanced supervised learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Specifically, in the training set, we randomly choose $50$ labeled samples from each category for the last two categories, while keeping all the samples for the remaining categories. In the testing set, there are $1000$ samples per category. The experimental results are shown in Figure 5 of Appendix C.2. Note that the closer the model's predicted quantities for the last two categories are to 1000, the less it is affected by class imbalance. As shown in Figure 5(b), ERM + LRM yields higher predicted quantities for the last two categories compared to ERM alone, indicating that LRM can mitigate class imbalance in supervised learning. Moreover, the average classification accuracies of ERM and ERM + LRM are $87.13\\\\%$ and $89.41\\\\%$, respectively. Accordingly, ERM + LRM outperforms ERM by $2.28\\\\%$, showing the effectiveness of LRM in class-imbalanced supervised learning. Hence, compared with ERM, ERM + LRM is less susceptible to the impact of class imbalance in this dataset.\n\n>W2. As shown in Table1, the authors combine LRM with two semi-supervised methods: FlexMatch and DST. Can the proposed method be combined with other SSL methods, such as MixMatch [1] and ReMixMatch [2]?\n\n**AW2.** Thanks for your suggestion. We conduct experiments with one and four labeled samples for each category for SSL on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The experimental results of MixMatch + LRM and ReMixMatch + LRM are listed as follows. As can be seen, LRM is still effective when combined with MixMatch and ReMixMatch.\n| Dataset              | CIFAR-100 |        |\n|----------------------|-----------|--------|\n| # Label per category | 1         | 4      |\n| MixMatch             | 44.08    | 74.50 |\n| MixMatch+EntMin      | 25.00     | 75.27 |\n| MixMatch+BNM         | 63.63    | 79.98 |\n| MixMatch+LRM         | 66.64    | 81.35 |\n| ReMixMatch           | 69.32    | 83.09 |\n| ReMixMatch+EntMin    | 69.39    | 83.13 |\n| ReMixMatch+BNM       | 66.67    | 83.14 |\n| ReMixMatch+LRM       | **73.45**    | **83.25** |\n\n>W3.

We conduct experiments for UDA on the Office-Home dataset. The experimental results of PMTrans [3] + LRM are listed as follows.

So we want to\n> ask \u201cfor unlabeled samples, is there more precise guidance information available?\u201d\n\nTo me, this insinuates that the paper would look at imbalanced settings, as these seem to motivate this work here. In fact, though, this is deferred to future work:\n\n> As a future direction, we intend to investigate the relationship between the LRM and ERM, in the context of\n> class-imbalanced supervised learning.\n\n---\n\nTheorem 1:\n> In addition, Theorem 1 is loss-agnostic and solely relies on the mapping property of f (\u00b7)\n\nIt is *not* loss agnostic. In fact, the theorem itself states that it assumes L(x,y) =  0 => x = y, which is not true, e.g., for max-margin losses.\n\n> The linear classifier is an injective function, which thus satisfies Theorem 1.\n\nA linear classifier need not be injective. In fact, if C < d, it *cannot* be injective.\nRegarding softmax, if you use `f` as the softmax function, and `L` as cross-entropy, then I would no longer call `h` the \"features\" -- these are now the logits. And I don't think applying L2 normalization or ReLU nonlinearities to the logits is a common practice.\n\n---\n\nsec. 4.2\n> These label encodings serve as reliable supervised information for learning from labeled samples.\n> Moreover, note that the label encodings remain consistent for both labeled and unlabeled samples\n> under label insufficient scenarios studied in this paper. Consequently, it is reasonable to apply\n> label encodings to guide the learning process of unlabeled samples. \n\nthat is an unsubstantiated claim (at this point in the paper at least)\n\n> Specifically, we first calculate the weighted average of prediction probabilities for unlabeled samples in each category, i.e., prediction mean.\n\nThe way this is written is wrong, though the actual calculations presented in the paper seem to be sensible. You cannot average predictions for unlabeled samples *of a category*, precisely because the categories are unknown. So the averaging is actually over the predicted distribution of categories as provided by some classifier.\n\n### Theorem 3:\nTheorem 3 seems to be the wrong way around, in the sense that normally, you'd like the original loss/risk to be upper-bounded by your proposed surrogate, so that optimizing the latter gives some guarantees on the former.\n\nOn a positive note, though, Fig. 2 shows that in practice, the two values can be quite close, so this might be more a theoretical concern.\n\n### Readability:\nThe paper would benefit from grammar improvements. Mostly, these do not impact readability too much. Below are two examples where I don't think the overall sentence structure works.  \n\n\npage  2:\n> As the ERM heavily relies on the guidance of the label information and fails to fully utilize the potential of unlabeled\nsamples, leading to suboptimal performance in label insufficient scenarios.\n\npage 9: \n> Accordingly, under the setting where only labeled samples from both domains are\n> available for training, which can be regarded as a class-balanced supervised learning task."

Indeed, via the NCC phenomenon, we observe that in ERM, solely $C$ ($C$ is the total number of categories) label encodings guide the learning process of labeled samples. Also, we theoretically prove that the utilization of label encodings can induce the NCC phenomenon under specific conditions. **Building upon this observation, we further find that label encodings can also serve as guidance information for unlabeled samples**.

In the claim that \"Since these label encodings serve as accurate supervision information\", these label encodings are referred to **ground-truth** label encodings, i.e., $\\\\{\\mathbf{e}_c\\\\}\\_{c =1}^C$, in our manuscript. Here, $\\mathbf{e}_c$ denotes the one-hot label encoding associated with category $c$, which is a one-hot vector where its $c$-th element equals 1 while all other elements are 0. However, in the appendix, $\\mathbf{w}_c^u$ ($\\mathbf{s}_c^u$) in Eq.(7) is refer to an **estimated** label encoding. It may be incorrect at the beginning of the training iteration.

In fact, though, this is deferred to future work:\n\"As a future direction, we intend to investigate the relationship between the LRM and ERM, in the context of class-imbalanced supervised learning.\"\n\n**AW3.** Firstly, **we want to emphasize that the motivation of this paper is to find more precise guidance information for unlabeled samples**. Based on the NCC phenomenon, we find that the guidance information of the ERM is the label encodings. Also, under label insufficient scenarios studied in this paper, the label encodings of labeled samples remain consistent with those of unlabeled samples. Accordingly, it is reasonable to apply label encodings as guidance information to guide the learning of unlabeled samples. Inspired by this, we propose the LRM. Secondly, unlike EntMin, the LRM can alleviate the **class-imbalanced issue in label insufficient scenarios (but not supervised learning)** to some extent. **In Appendix C of our manuscript, we have provided a detailed analysis and empirical comparison in label insufficient scenarios**. Thirdly, the LRM draws inspiration from NCC, which is a widely observed phenomenon within the ERM framework. Thus, **we reveal the theoretical relationship between LRM and ERM (but not EntMin) under the setting of class-balanced supervised learning (but not label insufficient scenarios)**."

In fact, the theorem itself states that it assumes L(x,y) = 0 => x = y, which is not true, e.g., for max-margin losses.\n\n**AW4.** We appreciate your pointing out the inappropriate statements, and we sincerely apologize for this. **We will remove inappropriate statements and carefully revise the presentation in the revision**.\n\n> W5. \"The linear classifier is an injective function, which thus satisfies Theorem 1.\"A linear classifier need not be injective. In fact, if $C < d$, it cannot be injective. Regarding softmax, if you use f as the softmax function, and L as cross-entropy, then I would no longer call h the \"features\" -- these are now the logits. And I don't think applying L2 normalization or ReLU nonlinearities to the logits is a common practice.\n\n**AW5.** We agree with you that the linear classifier is an injective function only under certain conditions and under certain conditions on the input, the softmax function is injective. Here we just discuss some cases where Theorem 1 can be applied. We will revise the discussion in the revision.\n\n> W6. \"These label encodings serve as reliable supervised information for learning from labeled samples. Moreover, note that the label encodings remain consistent for both labeled and unlabeled samples under label insufficient scenarios studied in this paper. Consequently, it is reasonable to apply label encodings to guide the learning process of unlabeled samples.\" that is an unsubstantiated claim (at this point in the paper at least)\n\n**AW6.** We want to emphasize once again that **these label encodings** refer to **ground-truth** label encodings rather than **estimated** ones. Please refer to AW2 for details. Furthermore, as an example, let's assume that there are two categories, i.e., cat, and dog, and their ground-truth (one-hot) label encodings are denoted as $[1, 0]$ and $[0,1]$, respectively. For the labeled samples, we can directly utilize those ground-truth label encodings to guide their learning. As for the unlabeled samples, based on the property (3) of Theorem 2 in our manuscript, we can first estimate the label encodings through prediction means for unlabeled samples, and then align them with their corresponding ground-truth label encodings. By doing so, the learning of unlabeled samples can be effectively guided. Accordingly, these label encodings can serve as supervision information for both labeled and unlabeled samples.\n\n> W7. \"Specifically, we first calculate the weighted average of prediction probabilities for unlabeled samples in each category, i.e., prediction mean.\" The way this is written is wrong, though the actual calculations presented in the paper seem to be sensible. You cannot average predictions for unlabeled samples of a category, precisely because the categories are unknown. So the averaging is actually over the predicted distribution of categories as provided by some classifier.\n\n**AW7.** We are sorry for this confusion. Indeed, **for a category, we can obtain the predicted probabilities of all unlabeled samples belonging to that category, which are provided by some classifier. Then, using those predicted probabilities as weights, we can calculate the weighted average of all unlabeled samples, i.e., prediction mean**. In the revision, we will modify \"Specifically, we first calculate the weighted average of prediction probabilities for unlabeled samples in each category, i.e., prediction mean. Based on the properties of prediction means, they can serve as an estimation for label encodings.\" to \"Specifically, for a category, we first obtain the predicted probabilities via some classifier of all unlabeled samples belonging to that category. Then, using those predicted probabilities as weights, we can calculate the weighted average of all unlabeled samples, i.e., prediction mean. Based on the properties of the prediction mean, it can serve as an estimation of the label encoding corresponding to that category.\"\n\n> W8. Theorem 3 seems to be the wrong way around, in the sense that normally, you'd like the original loss/risk to be upper-bounded by your proposed surrogate, so that optimizing the latter gives some guarantees on the former. On a positive note, though, Fig. 2 shows that in practice, the two values can be quite close, so this might be more a theoretical concern.\n\n**AW8.** We feel that there may be a misunderstanding about Theorem 3. Theorem 3 is just to reveal the relationship between LRM and ERM but not treat LRM as a surrogate of ERM, since ERM and LRM are for different purposes that LRM is proposed to utilize unlabeled data and ERM is for labeled data. We will make it clearer in the revision."

Below are two examples where I don't think the overall sentence structure works. (i) As the ERM heavily relies on the guidance of the label information and fails to fully utilize the potential of unlabeled samples, leading to suboptimal performance in label insufficient scenarios. (ii) Accordingly, under the setting where only labeled samples from both domains are available for training, which can be regarded as a class-balanced supervised learning task.\n\n**AW9.** Thanks for catching those for us, and we refine them as follows: (i) The ERM heavily relies on the guidance of label information, which thus fails to fully mine the potential of unlabeled samples. Accordingly, it cannot achieve good performance in label insufficient scenarios. (ii) Accordingly, when we solely utilize labeled samples from both domains for training, it can be regarded as a class-balanced supervised learning task. We will carefully revise the presentation in the revision. \n\n> Q1. The label-encoding risk is a global quantity, in the sense that is needs to know all training points to be calculated, and does not decompose into a sum over individual points. How does that integrate into mini-batch training?\n\n**AQ1.** We are sorry for this confusion. In each mini-batch, we can obtain the predicted probabilities that each sample in the mini-batch belongs to all categories, which are offered by some classifier. Then, the label encoding associated with each category can be estimated by calculating its corresponding prediction mean. Accordingly, **we can calculate the label-encoding risk in each mini-batch, which is an approximation of the label-encoding risk by using all the data**. Empirically, we find that using this simple approximation can achieve good performance. We will add such discussions in the revision.\n\n> Q2. [...] while in contrast, according to properties (4) and (5) in Theorem 2, LRM minimizes the label-encoding risk, which is verified in Appendix D.4. I don't understand this argument. Doesn't the LRM minimize the Label-encoding risk by construction? What does this have to do with (4) and (5)\n\n**AQ2.** Here we want to express that **LRM can force the prediction probability of each unlabeled sample to be sharper (i.e., close to one-hot vector) by minimizing the label-encoding risk, thereby enhancing the prediction discriminability. The properties (4) and (5) in Theorem 2 theoretically explain why minimizing the label-encoding risk can achieve this property**. This property is similar to EntMin but in different ways where EntMin achieves this property by minimizing the entropy of the prediction probability of each unlabeled sample. We conduct experiments in Appendix D.4 to verify that LRM can achieve this property even better than EntMin.\nWe will make it clearer in the revision."
