                    "value": "This paper studies how to enforce user-side fairness in (off-)policy learning. Specifically, the paper considers allocating (i) the same action choice probability regardless user's sensitive attributes (e.g., allocating the decisions of credit lending $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ regardless of their gender) and (ii) the same benefits (i.e., conditional policy value) for different user demographic groups. For this, the paper proposes the combination of the following two methods. The first one is fair representation learning, which aims to learn a feature $\\Phi(X)$ which is predictive for the outcome ($Y$), but is not predictive for the sensitive feature ($S$). The second is to impose three types of fairness constraints to the policy learning objectives. The results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than a naive baseline that myopically optimizes for the policy value without the fairness constraints."

                    "value": "1. **Some formulation and mathematical descriptions should be double-checked.**\nSpecifically, there are some contradictions between the text description and the mathematical formulation of the *action fairness*. As the definition of action fairness should affect the theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations in the rest of the paper, this seems to be a critical concern.  Please refer to Question 1 for details.\n\n2. **Related work seems insufficient.** \nSpecifically, while the paper proposes a fair representation learning method, no discussion of fair representation learning is provided in the related work. It was thus difficult to judge if the proposed approach is novel enough from the manuscript due to the lack of this discussion.\n\n3. **No discussion on how the specific problem of off-policy learning has been resolved.** In my understanding, enforcing fairness in OPL is difficult because $V_s$  $(= \\mathbb{E}_{A \\sim \\pi(X)}[Y | X, A, S=s])$, which is necessary for imposing the constraints on \"value fairness\", is not easily estimated with biased logged data. However, there is no explicit discussion on this point, and it seems that the paper just applied what has been successful in the online setting to the off-policy setting, without discussing particular challenges we will face in OPL. It is not clear what kind of OPL-related problems this paper tries to solve, and also there is no discussion about this point in the related work. It would also be beneficial to have additional ablations for this part in the experiments as well.\n\n4. **Results of the real-world experiments do not seem promising.** The proposed approach improves \"action fairness\", however, it does not improve or even sometimes worsens the \"value fairness\" compared to the naive, unconstrained policy. Justifications are needed for this point.\n\n5. **The clarity of writing has some room for improvement.** Aside from the above points, this paper has some additional ambiguous parts. Please refer to Questions 2 and 3."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. **Definition of action fairness**\n\nFirst, the paper defines the action fairness as follows.\n\n> a policy $\\pi$ should assign the same action $A=A'$ to two individuals with the same covariates $X = X'$ but different gender $S=S'$.\n\nHowever, the paper repeatedly mentions that covariates $X$ can also be a factor of unfairness even if the algorithm does not explicitly make decisions on the sensitive attributes $S$ as follows.\n\n> in observational data, **other variables may act as proxies of for gender, and, hence, the learned policy may still lead to discrimination** due to the underlying data-generation process. (Introduction)\n\n> Action fairness is .. It ensures that individuals who only differ with respect to their sensitive attributes (**and covariates correlated with them**) receive the same decision. (Section 4)\n\nGiven this kind of confoundings, I guess the action fairness should instead be defined as follows.\n\n*Let $\\bar{X} \\subseteq X$ be a covariate that does not depend on the sensitive attribute $S$ (i.e., $\\bar{X} \\perp S$). Then, a policy $\\pi$ should assign the same action $A=A'$ to two individuals with the same covariates $X \\setminus \\bar{X} = X' \\setminus \\bar{X'}$ but different gender $S \\neq S'$ and the associated attributes $\\bar{X} \\neq \\bar{X'}$*. \n\nThis modification will be needed because we can consider the following situation: $X_0 = f(S_0)$ and $X_{1:m}$ is drawn independent of $S_0$. In this case, the original condition can still cause discrimination because the policy can still allocate different actions depending on $X_0$ even if the policy does not explicitly depend on $S$ (i.e., \"$\\pi(X) \\perp S$\" as described in the paper).\n\nCould you provide any justification for this point?\n\n2. **\"*Parato-optimal*\" and \"*general*\" policies in related work**\n\nThe paper cites Viviano & Bradic, 23 as one of the most important related works and discusses the differences. However, it was not clear for me what are \"*Parato-optimal*\" and \"*general*\" policies refer to. Clarifications are needed for this point.\n\n3. **Experimental details**\n\nIn the synthetic experiment section, I found this description:\n\n> We provide the results for our framework across three different policy scores, namely $m \\in $ {DM, IPS, DR}. \n\nHowever, Table 1 reports the results of only one of them, and the section does not describe which method is used. Additionally, I could not find any additional results even in the Appendix. Could you provide some clarification on this? I also suggest reporting the number of random seeds used for the experiment.\n\n**Some other suggestions for improvement (not really weaknesses)**\n- On page 4, the paper denotes \"$\\mu_j(X, S) = \\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j], j = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$, are the outcome regression functions\" (of DM and DR). However, $\\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j]$ by definition refers to the (conditional) expected reward rather than the outcome of regression. $\\mu_j(X, S) \\approx \\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j]$ should be more appropriate (i.e., using \"$\\approx$\" instead of \"$=$\").\n\n- Reading the Introduction, it was unclear whether the paper was focusing on user- or action-side fairness. Since there are some discussions on item fairness in recommender systems (e.g., Singh & Joachims, 18), it might be helpful to explicitly mention either sensitive features belonging to users' covariate or actions' features. (In Section 2, I soon realized that the paper focuses on user-side fairness, though)\n\nSingh & Joachims, 18: Ashudeep Singh, Thorsten Joachims. \"Fairness of Exposure in Rankings\". KDD, 2018."

We took all your comments at heart and improved our paper as follows:\n\n## Response to \u201cWeaknesses\u201d\n\n1. Formulations and mathematical descriptions: Thank you for pointing this out. Please refer to our \u201cResponse to Questions\u201d.\n2. Related work on fair representation learning: We kindly refer to Appendix A.1, in which we provide a brief overview of related fair representation learning. We would like to emphasize that our main contribution is **not** a new method for fair representation learning. Rather, we adapt fairness notions and provide an **understanding of how these fairness notions interact in the context of off-policy learning**, while we at the same time propose a **practical framework to learn fair optimal policies and provide theoretical guarantees** in the form of generalization bounds. However, we acknowledge that the literature stream on fair representation learning deserves a more thorough treatment in our related work. \n\n    **Action:** We **expanded our related work on fair representation learning and moved it to the main paper** (see Sec. 2, new paragraph \u201cfair representation learning\u201d). Furthermore, we **added new experiments** using alternative approaches for fair representation learning (see our **new Appendix K**). However, we emphasize that fair representation learning is orthogonal to our contribution as we develop a new framework on top of it for fair off-policy learning.\n\n3. How is the problem of off-policy learning resolved? Thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point. You are correct that one of the key challenges in combining off-policy learning with our fairness constraints is the problem of estimating the conditional policy values $V^\\mathrm{m}_s(\\pi)$. In our paper, **we proposed unbiased estimators** $\\hat{V}^\\mathrm{m}_s(\\pi)$ (see Sec. 5.2.), which can be used in combination with any standard off-policy learning method $\\mathrm{m} \\in \\{\\mathrm{DM}, \\mathrm{IPW}, \\mathrm{DR}\\}$. In our experiments, we **provided ablation studies** in the sense that we applied our framework with all three methods $m$ (see e.g., Table 1). Furthermore, we **provided theoretical guarantees** for the finite-sample errors of our fairness objective estimators in the form of generalization bounds (Theorem 1), which depend on the method $m$ (through the constant $K_m$). Hence, **we provided both theoretical and empirical insights for solving the off-policy learning problem** in our fairness context.\n\n    **Action:** We clarify the above in both Sec. 5.2. and Sec. 5.3. Furthermore, we emphasize the dependence of the bounds in Theorem 1 on the off-policy learning method $m$.\n\n4. Results on real-world data: In Table 2, we first report the results for our framework with only action fairness and without value fairness (second row, \u201cFairPol only with action fairness\u201d). Here, value fairness is indeed worse compared to the unrestricted policy (first row). However, this is to be expected as FairPol enforces action fairness, which can worsen value fairness (we refer to our toy example in Appendix C. for a detailed discussion on this issue). In contrast, the (estimated) action fairness is improved by a large margin. Furthermore, comparing our results for value fairness (third and fourth row of Table 2) directly with the unrestricted policy (first row) is misleading because the unrestricted policy does not ensure action fairness. Instead, FairPol with max-min fairness (fourth row of Table 2) is effective in improving value fairness compared to FairPol with only action fairness (second row of Table 2). In summary, **the results using real-world data confirm the effectiveness of our framework.**\n\n    **Action:** We followed your suggestion and expanded our discussion of our results using real-world data in Sec. 6.\n\n2. Clarity of writing: Thank you for pointing this out. We improved our writing along your suggestions. Please refer to our \u201cResponse to Questions\u201d."

Definition of action fairness: Thank you for critically questioning our definition of action fairness and for allowing us to elaborate on our definition. You are correct that in our definition of action fairness ($\\pi(X) \\perp S$), our policy $\\pi$ is a function of all confounders $X$, i.e., also the ones that may be spuriously correlated with $S$. However, enforcing the independence statement $\\pi^{\\mathrm{af}}(X) \\perp S$ ensures that the policy $pi$ does not depend on such spuriously correlated confounders. To see this, let us consider the example you suggested, where $X_0 = f(S)$ for some (measurable) function $S$ and $X_{1:m}$ are independent of $S$. This implies that $\\pi(X) = \\pi(f(S), X_1, \\dots, X_m)$ is a (measurable) function of $S$. Hence, the independence $\\pi(f(S), X_1, \\dots, X_m) \\perp S$ only holds if either $f$ is constant (in which case $X_0$ and $S$ are independent), or if $\\pi(\\cdot, x_1, \\dots, x_m)$ is constant for all x_1, \\dots, x_m (almost surely). We agree that the definition you provided would be another valid way of defining action fairness. However, the benefit of our definition is that we do not assume prior knowledge on $X$ (e.g., which components are independent of $S$). \n\n    **Action:** We added a clarification to Sec 4.1 along the above lines.\n\n2. Pareto optimal policies: In our paper, we go beyond existing work from Viviano and Brandic (VB) in several ways: (i) We consider different fairness notions than VB (i.e., action fairness, value fairness, and interactions thereof); (ii) VB maximize fairness over the set of Pareto optimal policies. Here, Pareto optimality is defined so that the policy value of one sensitive group cannot be improved without reducing the policy value for the opposite group. In contrast, we propose to incorporate our fairness notions by adjusting the off-policy learning objective (value fairness), and then maximize this objective over the class of action fair policies. (iii) While VB is restricted to learning linear policies, our approach (outlined in (ii)) enables learning arbitrarily _non-linear_ policies (which we refer to as \u201cgeneral policies\u201d). This is possible because we can incorporate the action fairness constraint by leveraging fair representation learning to obtain a representation independent of the sensitive attribute, which can be used in a second step to train an optimal policy. Notwithstanding, the VB approach can **not** work with non-linear policies and uses different fairness notions, hence, is **not** applicable in our case.\n\n    **Action:** We clarified the definition of \u201cPareto-optimality\u201d and \u201cgeneral policy\u201d in our related work and elaborated on the differences in our paper.\n\n3. Experimental details: **In Table 1, we reported the results for all methods** $\\mathrm{m} \\in \\{\\mathrm{DM}, \\mathrm{IPW}, \\mathrm{DR}\\}$. Here, for each method, we reported three rows corresponding to $m$. In particular, we do not observe large differences in results between the three methods. Thus, we fixed $m = \\mathrm{DR}$ (corresponding to the doubly robust method) in our other experiments (e.g., Table 2; Fig. 3. and 4.).\n\n    **Action:** We added a clarification to Sec. 6.\n\n\n\n## Response to \u201cOther suggestions\u201d\n\n\n\n* \u201cOutcome regression\u201d: Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity. **Action:** We replaced the naming \u201coutcome regression\u201d with \u201cresponse surface\u201d, which is consistent with previous work on off-policy learning and treatment effect estimation.\n* User vs action covariates: Thank you. You are correct in that we defined our covariates $X$ to be user-specific attributes, not attributes of the action/treatment. **Action:** We added a clarification to Sec. 3."

You are correct that in our definition of action fairness ($\\pi(X | S)$), our policy $\\pi$\n is a function of all confounders $X$, i.e., also the ones that may be spuriously correlated with $S$.\n\nIn this case, the following sentence in the current draft should be mathematically incorrect, as I pointed out in the initial review. This part should be revised to avoid readers' confusion about math in this paper.\n\n> a policy $\\pi$ should assign the same action $A = A'$ to two individuals with the same covariates $X=X'$ but different gender $S \\neq S'$.\n\nI am not pointing out the description of Definition 1. Rather, the concept of describing action fairness (the above sentence) is contradictory to the description in Introduction.\n\n> We agree that the definition you provided would be another valid way of defining action fairness. However, the benefit of our definition is that we do not assume prior knowledge on $X_0$ (e.g., which components are independent of $S$).\n\nIn addition, I do not suggest assuming prior knowledge on $X_0$ here. My point is that the proper description, that aligns with Introduction or some other sentences in the paper,  should need $X_0$, regardless of assuming prior knowledge on $X_0$.\n\n---\n\n- About suggestion and revision\n\n> \u201cOutcome regression\u201d: Thank you for pointing out this ambiguity. Action: We replaced the naming \u201coutcome regression\u201d with \u201cresponse surface\u201d, which is consistent with previous work on off-policy learning and treatment effect estimation.\n\nI was not commenting on the terminology but was pointing out the improper use of math. By definition, $\\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A=j]$ is by the expected outcome conditioned on $X, S, A=j$. Therefore, if the paper denotes $\\mu_j(X, S) = \\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A=j]$, $\\mu_j(X, S)$ cannot be the regressed outcome (because it is the \"true\" expected outcome by definition) in DM and DR. Though I haven't checked all the math descriptions, the math in this paper seems doubtful to me, given that there are already two misrepresentations.\n\n---\n\n- About theoretical analysis.\n\nThis is a clarification question, where are $\\nu$ and $\\eta$ defined in Theorem 1? (It seems they are not defined.)\n\n> Furthermore, we provided theoretical guarantees for the finite-sample errors of our fairness objective estimators in the form of generalization bounds (Theorem 1), which depend on the method $m$ (through the constant $K_m$).\n\nIn addition, several things remain unclear, e.g., (i) how is the source of difference in the generalization bound among DM, IPS, and DR? In other words, in what situation does the difference emerge? (ii) How the generalization bound can be different when considering fairness compared to standard analysis of the generalization bound of DM, IPS, and DR? (iii) How to interpret three results of generalization bounds? It would be great if the presentation of the theoretical analysis could be improved so readers can understand the connections and differences with the standard OPL papers.\n\n---\n\n- About the experiment.\n\n>  we provided both theoretical and empirical insights for solving the off-policy learning problem in our fairness context.\n\nTypical OPL papers (e.g., Swaminathan & Joachims, 15) often compare the methods with varying data sizes to confirm the theoretical results of generalization bound analysis, while not provided in this paper. \n\nOverall (not limited to the experiment section), the discussion of challenges in using observational data still seems thin from the manuscript despite being one important topic of this paper.\n\nSwaminathan & Joachims, 15: Adith Swaminathan and Thorsten Joachims. \"The Self-Normalized Estimator for Counterfactual\nLearning.\" NeurIPS, 2015."

In the following, we address your remaining concerns and are confident that this improved our paper further.\n\n* **Page limit:** Thank you for pointing this out. We were unsure whether the page limit applies during the rebuttal, and, to address your comment, we uploaded a revised version with exactly 9 pages. \n* **Action fairness:** We apologize for the misunderstanding. You are correct, our sentence in the introduction does not fit our formalization of action fairness. **Action:** We changed our introduction to action fairness at the beginning of Sec. 4. to fit our formal definition.\n* **Outcome regressions/response surfaces:** You are correct that response surfaces $\\mu_j(X, S)$ denote the ground-truth expectation of $Y$ conditioned on $X, S, A = j$. This is deliberate because the response surfaces $\\mu_j(X, S)$ do not denote estimated quantities. However, this conditional expectation can be estimated from the observational data (e.g., by performing a regression of Y on X, S, A.). Note that the same holds for the ground-truth behavioral policy $\\pi_b$, which reduces to a classification problem for binary treatments. In our experiments, we use a TARNet [1] to estimate the nuisance parameters (i.e., $\\mu_j$ and $\\pi_b$). However, our framework is agnostic to the nuisance estimator and could be used in combination with any other estimator (e.g., S/T learner [2]).\n\n    Hence, we emphasize that **all our mathematical statements are correct.** Please note that off-policy learning/ treatment effect estimation under nuisance parameters is a well-studied topic and that we are not the first who propose this type of notation [2, 3,4]. Is your concern potentially that, in Theorem 1, we do not account for estimation errors in the nuisance parameters (because we use the ground-truth nuisance parameters)? While this is true, it is not a major concern because it has been shown that (under uniform consistency of nuisance estimators), estimation errors in the nuisance parameters do not affect the leading term in the convergence rate (see Sec. 3.1, Sec.3.2, Lemma 4 in [4]). This is also consistent with previous work that provides generalization bounds for off-policy learning [5]. \n\n."

While the proposed method can learn optimal policies under both action and policy value fairness, the underlying technique seems to be very similar to the existing methods.

Specifically, the proposed solution includes two steps: the first step aims to learn fair representation to ensure action fairness, while the second step incorporates the policy value fairness constraints to the objective function. For the first step, the idea of leveraging adversarial objectives to achieve independence between sensitive attribute and representation is similar to the concept of GAN, a common approach for fair representation learning. For the second step, the learning objective with fairness constraint is also straightforward. \n\n2. The paper doesn\u2019t compare with any algorithms in experiments.

                        "value": "# Response to reviewer TRGr\n\nThank you for your review and your helpful comments!\n\n\n## Response to \u201cWeaknesses\u201d\n\n* Thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify our technical contributions. You are correct in that we build our framework on existing literature streams, e.g., fair representation learning. However, we believe that our paper makes several non-trivial technical contributions beyond that. In particular: (i) We adapt fairness notions from related literature and **formalize these for off-policy learning from observational data**. (ii) We provide a **theoretical understanding of how these fairness notions interact in the context of off-policy learning** (see Lemma 1 and 2, as well as our toy examples in Appendix C and D). (iii) We propose a **practical framework to learn fair optimal policies. **While we build upon ideas from fair representation learning to achieve action fairness, we combine these with the off-policy learning methodology** and provide novel theoretical guarantees** in the form of generalization bounds (Theorem 1). Hence, we believe that our paper contains several technical contributions that add to the state-of-the-art in algorithmic fairness and off-policy learning in a non-trivial manner.\n\n    **Action:** We clarified our technical contributions in Sec.1. We also expanded our discussion (see end of Sec. 6), in which we also reiterated our contributions \n\n* **No baselines available:** We agree that, generally, a thorough comparison with baselines is beneficial to provide a rigorous empirical evaluation. Unfortunately, there are **no** baselines directly available as our setting of fair policy learning has not yet been studied before.  \nNevertheless, we took great strides to adapt existing methods as baselines. In the context of our work, we see two potential literature streams that could provide methods baselines for our experiments: (i) Methods for standard off-policy learning from observational data (not considering fairness); and (ii) methods that incorporate fairness notions into off-policy learning. In the following, we lay out how we build upon methods from (i) and (ii) for benchmarking: \n    * For (i), the following three methods are considered standard in the literature [1]: the direct method, the IPW method, and the DR method. **Our proposed framework works for all of these, and we provided experiments for all three baselines **(see Table 1). We did not observe large differences in performance.\n    * For (ii), **we are not aware of any other work that aims at achieving the same fairness notions (i.e., combining action and value fairness) in the context of off-policy learning**. Any potential benchmarking experiment with existing methods would thus involve comparing methods that satisfy different fairness notions. Hence, **we follow established fairness literature [e.g., 2, 3] and do not compare methods targeted at different fairness notions**. Instead, we investigated in our experiments how well our proposed method achieves our proposed fairness notions, and how this affects the performance (policy value). For this purpose, **we provided several ablations studies:** for example, we remove parts of our method (value fairness), and **we compare with an unrestricted policy** that does not satisfy any fairness notions.\n\n    We agree that our approach for fair representation learning (adversarial domain confusion loss) could in principle be replaced by any other approach that aims at enforcing independence from the sensitive attribute.  Hence, we provide an **additional ablation study (see new Appendix K)**, where we compare the first step of our framework with two other approaches: (i) Adversarial learning using gradient reversal; and (ii) regularization using a Wasserstein distance. Our chosen approach (adversarial domain confusion loss) performs best, which is also consistent with prior literature [1].\n\n\n    **Action:** We **added new experiments** based on fair representation learning (see our **new Appendix K**)."

We took all your comments at heart and improved our paper accordingly.\n\n## Response to \u201cWeaknesses\u201d\n\n* **No baselines available:** We agree that, generally, a thorough comparison with baselines is beneficial to provide a rigorous empirical evaluation. Unfortunately, there are **no** baselines directly available as our setting of fair policy learning has not yet been studied before.  \nNevertheless, we took great strides to adapt existing methods as baselines. In the context of our work, we see two potential literature streams that could provide methods baselines for our experiments: (i) Methods for standard off-policy learning from observational data (not considering fairness); and (ii) methods that incorporate fairness notions into off-policy learning. In the following, we lay out how we build upon methods from (i) and (ii) for benchmarking: \n    * For (i), the following three methods are considered standard in the literature [1]: the direct method, the IPW method, and the DR method. **Our proposed framework works for all of these, and we provided experiments for all three baselines** (see Table 1). We did not observe large differences in performance.\n    * For (ii), **we are not aware of any other work that aims at achieving the same fairness notions (i.e., combining action and value fairness) in the context of off-policy learning**. Any potential benchmarking experiment with existing methods would thus involve comparing methods that satisfy different fairness notions (and thus have entirely **different** objectives that are **incompatible** and thus **not** comparable).  \nHence, **we follow established fairness literature [e.g., 2, 3] and do not compare methods targeted at different fairness notions**. Instead, we investigated in our experiments how well our proposed method achieves our proposed fairness notions, and how this affects the performance (policy value). Hence, **we provided several ablations studies:** for example, we removed parts of our method (value fairness), and **we compared with an unrestricted policy** that does not satisfy any fairness notions.\n\n    Nevertheless, we understand that you ask for a more extensive numerical evaluation. \n\n    **Action:** Our approach for fair representation learning (adversarial domain confusion loss) can in principle be replaced by any other approach that aims at enforcing independence from the sensitive attribute.  Hence, we provide a **new ablation study (see new Appendix K)**, where we compare the first step of our framework with two other approaches: (i) Adversarial learning using gradient reversal; and (ii) regularization using a Wasserstein distance. Our chosen approach (adversarial domain confusion loss) performs best, which is also consistent with prior literature [4].\n\n* **Limited discussion:** Thank you. We followed your suggestion and, to improve our paper, now offer **an extended discussion**. \n\n    **Action:** We followed your suggestion and moved parts of Appendix I to our **new Sec. 7**. In particular, we now discuss our contribution and provide an outlook on future research directions.\n\n* **Readability of plots:** Thank you; we have improved our plots. **Action:** We followed your suggestion and increased both line thickness and font size in Fig.3 and 4.\n\n\n## References\n\n[1] Athey and Wager (2021). \u201cPolicy learning from observational data\u201d Econometrica.\n\n[2] Madras et al.

The first one is called \"action fairness\" which aims to ensure that the learned policy should be independent of the sensitive attributes. The second one is called \"value fairness\" and there are two variants: \"envy-free fairness\" which aims to make the policy value the same across sensitive attributes and \"max-min\" fairness which aims to maximize the minimum policy value across sensitive attributes. They proposed a machine learning algorithm to achieve these fairness objectives in two steps. The first step is to achieve \"action fairness\". The paper borrows ideas from prior work to learn representations that are not predictive of sensitive attributes while maintaining predictive power of outcome using some loss functions including the confusion loss. The second step is to learn a policy using empirical counterfactual estimate of the policy value for each sensitive attribute with respect to the two proposed \"value-fairness\" objectives. They quantify the generalization error of the proposed algorithm, and conducted empirical evaluation on both simulated and real-world data."

                    "value": "1. One concern is that the paper does not discuss how they deal with observational data. In particular, the proposed method depends on several estimators like DM, IPW, DR. But some quantities are unknown in the observational setting, like \\mu_1, \\mu_0, \\pi_b. I would be great if the authors can discuss how these quantities are obtained, and how they affect the theoretical and empirical results. \n\n2. For empirical evaluation, especially for real-world data one, we do not know the counterfactual outcome of counterfactual actions. It would be great if the authors can discuss how the performance metrics are calculated. \n\n3. The contribution seems limited. The fairness notions proposed in this paper appear in many prior works. The approach to achieving \"action fairness\" seems to be borrowed from prior works. The approach to achieving \"value\" fairness is a direct application of counterfactual estimator. \n\n4. It would be great if the authors could discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these fairness objectives. In particular, when are these fairness objectives applicable? For example, envy-free does not seem to make sense to me in many applications, since it might happen that it is very easy to achieve larger expected outcome for one group than the other. Maybe the maximum value we can achieve for group A is 1, and the minimum value we can achieve for group B is 1 and the maximum for B is 2. Suppose there is a policy that can achieve value 1 for A and 2 for B, why would we decrease the value for B just to satisfy this fairness notation? For max-min fairness, similar arguments apply. Since group A is always lower in policy value, we will only learn our policy for group A. Why is this advantageous compared to fairness definitions that achieve pareto optimality? \n\nSome minor points:\n4. In assumption 1, it should be P(A=1 | X=x, S=s), right? Otherwise, equation (3) and (4) might be ill-defined since \\pi_b(X,S) can be zero. \n\n5. Equation (2), (3), (4), \\phi is a function of D, which contains i.i.d. random variables of several datapoints. But in the right hand side, there is only one datapoint. It is a bit confusing to me. \n\n6. Theorem 1 is hard to understand. I think it must depend on the logging/behavior policy. Maybe it is captured in K? It would be great if the authors can have a clear definition of these notations. And it does not seem to take into account the fact that we are in the observational setting as I mentioned in 1."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review and your helpful comments. As you can see below, we have carefully revised our paper along with your suggestions. \n\n\n## Response to \u201cWeaknesses\u201d\n\n1. **Observational data/ nuisance parameters:** Thank you for your question. You are correct that our method (or rather any method for off-policy learning) depends on the policy score $\\psi^\\mathrm{m}(\\pi, \\mathcal{D})$ and, therefore, on the unknown nuisance parameters $\\mu_1$, $\\mu_0$, and $\\mu_0$ (which correspond to the choice of $\\mathrm{m} \\in \\{\\mathrm{DM}, \\mathrm{IPW}, \\mathrm{DR}\\}$, respectively). Under Assumption 1, these nuisance parameters can be estimated from the observational data using arbitrary regression/machine learning algorithms (see Sec. 3). **In our experiments on synthetic data, we do not focus on the question of estimation errors in the nuisance parameters but rather aim to explore the impact of our proposed fairness notions**. For this purpose, we refrain from estimating the nuisance parameters but instead use the ground-truth nuisance parameters, which are known in our simulations (we refer to Appendix G for details). Note that we do this for all methods to ensure a fair comparison of the results.  \n\n    Motivated by your comment, we added **new experimental results** (see our **new Appendix L**). Therein, we re-ran our experiment from Table 1 but now use TARNet as a state-of-the-art method [1] to estimate nuisance parameters (instead of using the ground-truth). This allows us to analyze the robustness of our results on synthetic data with respect to nuisance errors. Our new results show that our results **remain robust** when using estimated nuisance parameters. \n\n    **Action:** We provided a more elaborate explanation for our evaluation. Furthermore, we **added new experimental results** by using TARNet for estimating nuisance parameters instead of using the ground truth (see our **new Appendix L)**. We added details regarding the implementation of TARNet to Appendix M.  \n\n2. **Empirical evaluation on real-world data:** Thank you for your question. You are correct that we do not observe the counterfactual outcomes on the real-world data, which means that we can **not** evaluate our methods using oracle metrics (as in Table 1).  As mentioned in the previous point, we use a TARNet to estimate the nuisance parameters on real-world data. Thus, we can plug the estimated nuisance parameters into our (conditional) policy value estimators $\\hat{V}^\\mathrm{m}(\\pi)$ and  $\\hat{V}^\\mathrm{m}_s(\\pi)$ (proposed in Sec. 5.2.). This is what we report in, e.g., Table 2. Of note, our evaluation is in line with works on treatment effect estimation, which often report the factual MSE as a heuristic to measure performance on real-world data [1]. In principle, our policy value estimators may be biased if not all confounders are collected in the data. However, in our experiments, we do not aim to compare performance (e.g., in terms of unbiased estimation), but rather aim to investigate the impact of our fairness notions on our learned policy.\n\n    For action fairness, we reported the Spearman correlation between policy predictions and the sensitive attribute, which enables detecting (potentially nonlinear) dependence.\n\n\n    **Action:** We added a clarification to Sec. 6.\n\n3. **Contribution/novelty of fairness notions:** Thanks. You are correct in that our proposed fairness notions are adapted from existing literature streams. For example, \u201caction fairness\u201d resembles \u201cdemographic parity\u201d in standard fair machine learning, and both \u201cmax-min\u201d and \u201cenvy-free\u201d fairness have also been proposed in works from optimization (e.g., from resource allocation). The reason is that the fairness notions are deeply grounded in distributive justice. Please note that **we do not claim to be the first to propose the mentioned fairness notions**. Instead, our contributions are as follows: \n    1. (i) We propose to adapt existing fairness notions from related literature (e.g., resource allocation), but **formalize these for off-policy learning from observational data**; \n    2. (ii) We provide a **theoretical understanding of how these fairness notions interact in the context of off-policy learning** (see Lemma 1 and 2, as well as our toy examples in Appendix C and D); \n    3. (iii) We propose a **practical framework to learn fair optimal policies and provide theoretical guarantees** in the form of generalization bounds.\n\n    **Action:** We clarified our contributions in Sec.1. We also expanded our discussion (see end of Sec. 6), in which we also reiterated our contributions"
