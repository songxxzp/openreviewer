Given a sequence $X$ of $n$ vectors of dimension $d$, authors propose to form an aggregate representation of context $X[<=t]$ for the vector $X_t$ by linearly projecting down $X[<=t]$ to $r$ dimensions and mean-pooling the representions to get a size-$r$ history $H_t$. Vector $H_t$ is incorporated into $X_t$ via attention (though there might be other ways of doing this e.g. concatenate + FF). In line with standard practice, authors also use local attention.\n\nAuthors compare the method to dense attention (and other baselines) on LM, text summarization, speech generation, point-cloud completion, forecasting tasks over a wide range of sequence lengths, and report modest gains on some of them and good 0-shot extrapolation to longer inputs."

Experimental evaluation is comprehensive and honest, encompassing tasks over various modalities over a wide range of sequence lengths. Wherever possible authors evaluate 0-shot extrapolation to longer inputs and show that their method extrapolates better than the baselines (due to locality of attention and cummulative itself)."

                    "value": "1. On sequences of length upto 8k, the proposed method lags behind hardware-optimized attention in terms of both performance and throughput. For most practical applications this regime is highly relevant.\n\n2. cummulative sum/mean is a special case of state spaces [S4, DSS, S4D] (similarly exponential moving average MEGA [Ma et al ICLR 2023]). Several follow-up works also use local attention layers similar to what authors use. Hence the paper doesnt offer a new technqiue but as pointed out above it does study a special case of using only cumsum/cummean.\n\n3. Performance compared to learnt global convolutions (state spaces, etc) is significantly lower on Long Range Arena pointing to the importance of decayed convolutions as compared to only fixed convolutions such as cummulative sum/mean without a decay factor. This is also evident by the author's need to additionally use positions enbeddings which models based on state spaces dont require (e.g. GSS [Mehta et al ICLR 2023]). State space + local attention has been conistently shown to extrapolate to much longer inputs (e.g. GSS: PG19, train length 4096, eval length 65k) where the performance improves with longer inputs as the model is able to leverage more context.\n\n4. Positional embeddings - the authors use additive relative bias in attention (c.f. T5, Alibi) which is undesirable due to IO aspects and will significantly slow down FLASH implementation. Rotary embeddings instead induce multiplicative relative bias and are friendly to FLASH (one can chose not to use FLASH and use vanilla attention but there is no reason why other users will not leverage it.)"

I do understand that log will probably not show up in runtime as other things will dominate.\n\n1. Please discuss the implementation of cummean. e.g. whether you're using FFT or else if you're using cumsum discuss how you ensure that the sums dont do outside the fp16 bounds (pre-normalize by the max, etc). e.g. for fp16 the largest possible value is 65k and so its not possible to post-divide by the index for input length >66k.
