By combining the proposed loss with two existing techniques: BN statistics modulation and stochastic restoration, the proposed method achieves promising results on several datasets.

However, there is no such experiments to support this claim. What will be the performance if we apply CL in the embedding space instead?\n- Also, instead of applying CL in the embedding space (between encoder and decoder), we can also apply CL in the second last layer (also some feature space). The claim \u201cthis practice primarily modifies the encoder layers, leaving the classifier head layers unchanged\u201d does not seem correct to me.\n- The authors claim that using a high temperature in the output contrastive loss will avoid too uniform class distribution. However, wouldn\u2019t this increase the confirmation bias if the label distributions between source and target are very different? Is it possible that this method can work is due to the label distribution difference between source and target domains is small?\n- From Table 5, it seems that most of the performance gains actually come from BN + SR, and neither of them is this paper\u2019s contribution. Would also like to see the numbers of BN + SR only, which is actually the strong baseline we should compare with.\n- Similarly, since BN and SR are not the core contributions of this paper, I don\u2019t think the authors should show parameters study for them in the main paper (Table 6).\n\n**2. Presentation.**\n- What exactly do the authors want to convey in Figure 1? I think we should have the label distribution of GTA and Cityscapes for comparison here.\n- In Section 3.3, the claim \u201cwe introduce the stochastic restoration \u2026\u201d is problematic. It sounds like the authors propose this technique. But actually not.\n- Again, it is good to show label distribution in Figure 3.\n\n**3. Related work.**\nSome important related works are missing.

                    "value": "(1) Lack of necessary ablation experiments. The authors propose a new loss function called Output Contrastive Loss, and adopt the other two existing techniques BN Statistics Modulation and Stochastic Restoration. Therefore, the key point of ablation experiments should be validating the effectiveness of each component in OCL. The existing experiment results in table 5 show that all of OCL, BN Statistics Modulation and Stochastic Restoration can improve the performance. While the authors should conduct experiments focusing on OCL itself. That is, conduct ablation experiments of using prediction pi/representation zi, defining positive and negative sets according to pixels/images, using high/low temperature.\n\n(2) The idea is not novel enough. Through I'm not familiar with test-time training, I still reckon that the idea of OCL is lack of novelty. The main idea of OCL is employing a high temperature, changing from using feature before head to using feature after head and changing from defining positive and negative sets based on images to pixels. From my point of view, through the three points sound logical, they are not combined well. In other words, they are more like three independent methods. Besides, using positive and negative sets based on pixels is not novel, which has been proposed in previous studies in contrastive learning (for example, PC$^{2}$Seg[1]). For the other two points, the reason of using feature after head is a bit trivial for me. And the reason of defining positive and negative sets based on pixels is not explained well. The authors could provide more experiment results and analyses to prove their importance and provide more insights.\n\n[1] Zhong, Yuanyi, et al. \"Pixel contrastive-consistent semi-supervised semantic segmentation.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision. 2021."

                    "value": "(1) As the ablation results shown in table 5, the performance gains are mainly brought by BN statistic Modulation and stochastic restoration in OCL, which are also adopted by CoTTA. In the table 3 (CS\u2192ACDC), we can see that CoTTA achieves similar performance with OCL. While in the table 2, the CoTTA even decreases the mIou (GTA\u2192CS) when OCL demonstrates much better performance. What's the main difference between the two tasks or datasets that makes CoTTA can not work well? Why does the OCL show much better performance than CoTTA in table 2 compared to table 3?"

Instead, high temperatures will lead to a uniform distribution.\n- In the 5th line of Eq 10 (in Supp A), the numerator should be $1 + sim(p_i, p_k) / \\tau$ instead of $sim ((1 + p_i, p_k) / \\tau)$\n\n2. The derived Eq 3 itself is already intuitive and easy to follow. Deliberately adding Eq 2 and derivations in Supp A is superfluous. Given this point, the main novelty of this paper is limited. BN Modulation and Stochastic Restoration are just lent from previous works.\n\n3. The experiments, though various, are not solid enough.\n- In Table 2, OCL only contributes marginally to DAFormer.\n- In Table 3, the advantage over CoTTA is limited, which may be from randomness.\n- Table 5 shows, OCL brings less improvements than BN. and S.R."

From table 2, DAformer performs significantly better than TTT methods but OCL is improving marginally on top.\n2. Limited novelty given the extensive literature on different combination of TTT, contrastive learning, and semantic segmentation. There isn\u2019t sufficient support (or experimental proof) for switching from feature contrast to output contrast, while the temperature and BN stats are mostly minor tricks.\n3. Clarification on the setting definition, similar to the Table 1 of TENT and Table 1 of COTTA. If I am understanding correctly, the proposed OCL method does not require pretraining with the OCL loss since OCL works on the output, different from existing TTT methods with SSL aux tasks, but assume online-TTT which uses parameters learned from previous test samples. Given the literature on TTT, online-TTT, Domain Generalization, Domain Adaptation, TTA, fully TTA, etc. such clarification will help readers understand the contribution.\n4. Missing clarification in Eq. 2 if the p_i and p_j prediction refers to the prediction after softmax, i.e. they are all positive.
