                    "value": "The paper proposes a new framework called Learning to Generate Predictor (LGPred) for long-term time series forecasting. The key idea is to generate a linear predictor dynamically tailored to the input time series, to overcome limitations of fixed linear predictors. LGPred uses time series decomposition into trend and seasonality components. Separate representation modules extract features from each component. A predictor generator uses the extracted features to generate the weights and biases of a linear predictor suited to the input series. A template predictor with bottleneck architecture is used to incorporate common forecasting knowledge and reduce computation cost. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance on 6 benchmark datasets covering disease, economics, energy, traffic and weather domains."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and valuable feedback. Concerning the questions and concerns that the reviewer raised, we provide our response below.\n\n- Hyperparameter\n    - For the hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, we added the results in appendix B6. Since our LGPred is a network that generates the network, the sensitivity to the hyperparameters related to the predictor generation is somewhat inevitable. However, we believe that our methodology of generating the predictor adaptively to the given time series has clear value even considering this limitation.\n- Bottleneck architecture for template predictor\n    - The reason we utilize the bottleneck architecture for our template predictor is to reduce the number of parameters to generate. As we mentioned in page 5, the number of parameters in predictor generator is significantly reduced due to the bottleneck architecture, although the number is still large. Also, the intuition behind the bottleneck architecture is the fact that the rank required for the linear predictor to predict time series is low. We conduct an experiment lowering the rank of the linear predictor by dividing the linear predictor into a bottleneck architecture of two linear layers having small latent dimension and measuring the performance. Our experiment results show that the performance is preserved even though the rank is much lower than the input and output length (d_latent =32). While subsequent research revealed that a larger latent dimension (rank) is required for predictor generation in most cases, the effectiveness of the bottleneck architecture in linear predictors and the effect of reducing the complexity of the bottleneck architecture are still meaningful.\n- Time series decomposition and our contribution.\n    - As the reviewer correctly stated, the time series decomposition is a standard technique and we do not claim it to be our contribution. However, our contribution lies in utilizing the time series decomposition for analyzing and understanding the characteristics of time series instead of directly utilizing it for time-series forecasting.\n- Limitation of utilizing linear predictor.\n    - In the paper, we conduct experiments on well-known benchmark datasets, which contain relatively simple patterns that can be predicted with a linear predictor. If the patterns become more complicated and harder, both linear predictor and our LGPred may fail to predict the patterns. However, this point holds true not only for linear predictors but also for more complicated models, and at least for the benchmarks covered so far, the linear predictor works as well as the other models. Therefore, we focus on other limitations of linear predictors rather than the pattern prediction capability. We focus on the limitation that the linear predictors cannot make predictions reflecting the dynamically changing characteristics of time series. Our experiment with synthetic data proves that this limitation exists, and we can overcome this limitation using our LGPred. Another limitation of the linear predictor is that it cannot utilize the\u3145 cross-variate correlation in multivariate time-series data. This limitation remains in our LGPred, and we already discussed in the Discussion section. Furthermore, we believe the limitation of linear predictor can be overcome by applying our LGPred to other time series forecasting models, which is capable by LGPred's orthogonality to other forecasting model. Our experiment results in appendix B.2. show the possibility of combining LGPred with the existing forecasting model and achieving better performance."

It is better to choose the best results from different lookback windows for PatchTST for a fair comparison.

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer providing valuable comments for our paper. For the concerns and issues raised by reviewer, we provide our responses below.\n\n- Reference of T>48 is considered as LTSF problem.\n    - Considering the definition of LTSF problem, the first work to distinguish LTSF problem from regular TSF problem is Informer [1], and they indicated that predicting 48 points or less as short-term forecasting and show that the forecasting performance of old methods start to decrease sharply around T=48. We follow the setting of the informer.\n- Reason why the number of channels in Trend block in Fig. 2\n    - During feature extraction, we decided to maintain the length of time dimension in the feature, to preserve the temporal information. However, for the channel dimension, since our generated predictor is applied in channel independence manner, we chose to mix the channel information and encode it into the features with length of d_rep instead of preserving it. This is the reason why we change the number of channels in the trend block of Fig.2, as explained in page 4.\n- Explanation about dilated temporal convolution network\n    - Regarding the dilated temporal convolution network, we added some explanation about dilated TCN and why we utilize dilated TCN for seasonality representation module in page 4.\n- Comparison with PatchTST\n    - In Table 1 and 2, we update the PatchTST performance by choosing the model showing the better MSE score between PatchTST/64 and PatchTST/42. Note that there are only a few experiments in which the best model changed due to this update.\n    - For the comparison between PatchTST and LGPred, we believe that our LGPred shows at least the same level of performance as PatchTST. For example, in Table 1, our LGPred shows equal or higher performance than PatchTST in 16 out of 32 experiments for MSE, 12 out of 32 experiments for MAE. In Table 2, our LGPred clearly outperforms PatchTST in most cases.\n    - In Table 3, we did not include the result of PatchTST in our first submission. We obtained the scores of baseline models in Table 3 from the TimesNet paper [2], and the performance of PatchTST is not included in the original paper. Note that the results in short input length situations have not been reported in the PatchTST paper [3]. However, we ran additional experiments using the implementation in Time-Series-Library (https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library), which is an official implementation of TimesNet, and added the results in Table 3. The result shows that LGPred outperforms PatchTST when the input length is limited in most cases.\n- Complexity analysis\n    - For the complexity analysis, we added the results in appendix B.7. Thank you for your comment and please check section B.7 in appendix of our updated paper.\n- Using RNN and Transformer for the trend representation module\n    - In appendix, we added the experiment results using the RNN and transformer architecture for trend representation module. The experiment results indicate that utilizing FC layer for trend component and CNN for seasonality component shows the best performance. Furthermore, results also confirm that our assumption that RNN, FC, and transformer layer is more suitable for capturing the trend characteristics compared to CNN is correct.\n\n[1] Haoyi Zhou, et al.

I appreciate applying the bilinear layer since it seems not being used in recent forecasting literature. But *Learning to Generate Predictor* may not be the best term to summarize the model novelty for me. If the authors still prefer using *Learning to Generate Predictor*, it would be better to add more discussion to clearly state the difference from the meta-learning type model.\n\n2. The statement \"*LGPred is the first attempt at adaptively generating a predictor reflecting the characteristics of each time series.*\" seems also a little bit overclaimed. For example, in DeepAR, the network will first generate the $\\mu$/$\\sigma$ or $\\mu$/$\\alpha$ for Gaussian distribution or negative binomial (NB) distribution respectively. During the inference stage, the forecasting point will be sampled from the Gaussian/NB distribution. In this case, the Gaussian/NB distribution can be viewed as the *Predictor*, and the parameters in the predictor are learned with a network. \n\n3. The test data loader sets `drop_last = True`. In this case, the last several test samples are ignored, which will impact the accuracy of results in Table 1- Table 3. It would be better if the authors could fix it.\n\n4.

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s thoughtful comments. Below, we reply to the comments raised by the reviewer.\n\n- Relation between meta-learning type model and LGPred\n    - Reviewer mentioned that the LGPred is a bilinear type layer rather than a meta-learning type model. We respectfully disagree. In general, meta-learning type models adopt a two-tier learning; the inner loop that conducts the adaptation to the given task and the outer loop that trains the model to better adapt to the given task. For our LGPred, the predictor generation path works as the inner loop conducting the adaptation to the given time series, and the training of the model works as the outer loop. In this sense, the work of LGPred is a kind of meta-learning type framework, rather than a bilinear structure. We draw inspiration from meta-learning model, and we make this point clearer in the introduction section of our updated paper. While applying the predictor originated from the input time-series to the input time-series bears some resemblance to bilinear structure, we believe the term \u2018learning to generate predictor\u2019 better explains the novelty of our LGPred.\n- Learning to generate in prior work DeepAR\n    - In DeepAR, the mean and standard deviation of prior distribution is predicted, and the prediction values are probabilistically generated from the distribution. However, considering the fact that the objective of DeepAR is probabilistic forecasting, the mean and standard deviation are the prediction output itself rather than the predictor. In this sense, we believe that our statement \u201cLGPred is the first attempt at adaptively generating a predictor reflecting the characteristics of each time series\u201d is not overclaimed.\n- \u2018drop_last\u2019 config in test loader\n    - Before answering, we are very impressed that the reviewer kindly checked out our code. The reviewer kindly informed that the drop_last config is set to be True, and this results in some test samples being ignored. We agree with the reviewer\u2019s point. However, all prior works evaluate their methods under the same situation, and we follow the experimental setup for fair comparison. Please see the following official implementation provided by the authors.\n        - Informer: https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020/blob/main/exp/exp_informer.py (L77)\n        - Autoformer: https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer/commit/d9100709b04e3e8361170794eba4f47b1afb217f (L20, committed after publish)\n        - FEDformer: https://github.com/MAZiqing/FEDformer/blob/master/data_provider/data_factory.py (L19)\n        - TimesNet: https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/blob/main/data_provider/data_factory.py (L28)\n        - PatchTST: https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST/blob/main/PatchTST_supervised/data_provider/data_factory.py (L19)\n        - ETSformer: https://github.com/salesforce/ETSformer/blob/main/data_provider/data_factory.py (L19)\n        - LTSF-Linear: https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear/commit/6fe4c28ff36b4228792f2bbe513e807577e4a57e (L20, committed after publish)\n- Random control and Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis\n    - Thank you for the reviewer\u2019s kind comment to improve the completeness of our paper. For the random control experiment and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, we added the results in appendix B5 and B6. Note that some of our original hyperparameter settings in Table 1 turn out to be vulnerable to random initialization, and we updated some scores in Table 1. Regarding the experiments in Table 3, we will update the random control experiment results if accepted."

Furthermore, TiDE [2] has previously delved into refining linear models specifically for time series forecasting. Given the architectural similarities between these MLP-based models, a more in-depth comparison and differentiation would enhance clarity.\n2. The absence of comprehensive ablation studies leaves the intrinsic value of each component in the proposed method ambiguous. For instance, the ablation analysis in [1] revealed that simpler stacked linear models (i.e., TMix-Only) could rival the performance of the presented methodology. This raises questions regarding the neccesity of LGPred's individual components.\n3. The delineation of the dimensions for the linear and fully-connected layers remains ambiguous. For multivariate time series data, these layers could be applied across either time or feature dimensions, as depicted in Figure 2. Unfortunately, the descriptions on the predictor generator and template predictor (page 4) do not explain the dimensional characteristics of these layers adequately.\n\n[1] Chen, Si-An, et al. \"TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting.\" Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 2023\n\n[2] Das, Abhimanyu, et al. \"Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder.\" Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 2023"

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's valuable comments. For the issues and concerns raised by the reviewer, we provide our responses below.\n\n- Comparison with TSMixer and TiDE\n    - We appreciate the reviewer suggesting the interesting related works. However, we believe the contribution of TSMixer[1] and TiDE[2] is clearly different from our LGPred. These works mainly focus on utilizing the multivariate features, while our LGPred focuses on adapting a model to a given time series. Meanwhile, the architectural similarity between these TSMixer and the trend representation module of our LGPred is an interesting point, and we added the comparison in method and related work section. Regarding the performance comparison, we wish the reviewer to understand the performance comparison is not conducted in the paper since these works are concurrent with our work published in August and September.\n- Ablation studies to show the value of each component\n    - We already have presented the ablation study results in appendix B.1. We believe that the results in appendix B1 prove the value and necessity of the components of our LGPred.\n- Dimensional characteristics of FC layers in LGPred\n    - We want to note that our LGPred conducts forecasting in channel-independent manner, i.e., the same predictor is applied across all features, as done in prior works [3][4]. While the architectures and layers for multivariate features such as mixer architecture or temporal convolutional layer are applied in predictor generation path, the objective of these architecture is to generate the predictor suitable for prediction of all features, not utilizing multivariate correlation in prediction. To this end, as we clearly stated in predictor generator section in page 4, we flatten the feature and use it to generate predictor shared across all channels.\n- Nonlinear activation function\n    - As reviewer clearly pointed out, the concatenation of multiple linear layers functions as a single linear, and this is just what we intended. While linear predictor is proven to be effective in long-term forecasting task in a prior work [3], we believe that the limitation of linear predictor is that its simplistic architecture cannot reflect the dynamically changing characteristics of time series. To address this limitation, our goal is to adapt a \u2018linear\u2019 predictor suitable for given time series, and the final predictor model is a linear predictor without any nonlinear activation. When we apply our LGPred to forecasting models with nonlinearity as done in Appendix B.2, forecasting model in prediction path also utilizes nonlinearity. Note that we utilize the non-linear activation functions of GeLU in the predictor generation path, as we already have stated in Section 3 and Figure 2.\n- Extension to datasets with cross-variate correlation\n    - Since our base model is a linear predictor, which is a channel independent model, handling cross-variate correlation with LGPred is not straightforward. However, our LGPred is an orthoginal method with other time series forecasting method and we show that it is possible to combine LGPred with other models such as PatchTST and TimesNet in appendix B.2, and we believe that by combining with multivariate forecasting models such as TSMixer and TiDE, LGPred framework can tackle the multivariate forecasting tasks such as M5 or Favorita. Note that we already stated this limitation and possibility in the discussion section.\n\n[1] Chen, Si-An, et al. \"TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting.\" Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 2023\n\n[2] Das, Abhimanyu, et al. \"Long-term Forecasting with TiDE: Time-series Dense Encoder.\" Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 2023\n\n[3] Ailing Zeng, et al.
