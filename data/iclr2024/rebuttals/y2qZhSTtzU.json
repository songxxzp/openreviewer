Sparsity only makes activation patterns sparse but somehow there is no guarantee those will be invariant over other domains. I think there is a huge gap between the motivating theory and the proposed method. To convince me, I believe you should empirically show that all the remaining non-sparse features are indeed invariant according to P_{X,Y} you defined. \n\n2. Can you also perform the same method on BERT and ALPACA-7B? (i.e., IMO-BERT, IMO-ALPACA-7B)? Supposedly we should also see the improvement if the method is really working. \n\n3. Can you add the variance bound as well for the experiments? For some dataset, it reads like the improvement is totally due to randomness of init rather than the method.\n\n3. Your theory motivation apparently borrows from SCM based causality. But somehow I really didn't see any SCM figure in the paper. In particular, I only read:\n\n\"From any causal graphs in Fig. ??, we conclude that p(Y |Hi, Hj ) = p(Y |Hi) so that the cross entropy term in L\u2126 remains the same when ....\",\n\nIt's quite unbelievable that the most important part of the theory is shown in Figure ??, so I could also just response in a way that my understanding is ??.\n\nWithout a clear make-up clarification, I will rate the draft as not ready just in terms of writing."

The main idea is to learn sparse mask layers that filter out spurious features while retaining invariant features. The masks are learned through the joint optimization of three loss terms: a cross-entropy loss for classification, a sparsity loss that enforces sparse masks, and a cosine-similarity loss that encourages the mask layers to extract label-specific features. The network is trained in a sequential manner from the top layer to the bottom layer. Theoretical analysis shows that given a set of causal and non-causal features. The empirical evaluation is done on binary and multi-class classification. Compared with a variety of language models including LLMs (few-shot in-context), the proposed method demonstrates superior performance on several datasets."

The theory assumes that all variables correlated with $Y$ are observed; however, this assumption may not hold in practice. For example, there may be an unobserved selection variable that introduces selection bias in the training domain by forming a collider with $Y$ and some non-causal variables $H_j$. In this case, $p(y|h_i, h_j) = p(y|h_i)$ does not hold. Removing $H_j$ may incur a higher cross-entropy loss than removing $H_i$.\n- The basic idea of the proposed method seems to be largely based on [1]. The main difference between the two methods, in my point of view, is the target to which the mask is applied (token embedding v.s. model weight). It is unclear whether there is any fundamental difference between these two approaches.\n\n[1] Zhang, Dinghuai, et al. \"Can subnetwork structure be the key to out-of-distribution generalization?.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
