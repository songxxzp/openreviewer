A total of 170 patients were included in the study, and traditional machine-learning models were applied (Logistic regression, XGBoost, and Random Forests). The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy with 97.1%."

I could not understand the positive and negative class. In terms of model application, I could not find the hyperparameters used in this paper (either a search of them). There is also a lack of results, considering that not all of them are shown in the paper. Also, you have to justify your data separation. Considering that is a small dataset, it is better to use k-fold cross-validation. \n\nIn general, the paper must be largely improved by describing all the processes that allow me to observe that machine learning models were applied correctly."
