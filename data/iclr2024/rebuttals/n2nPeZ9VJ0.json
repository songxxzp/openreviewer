                        "value": "We express our sincere gratitude for the reviewer's positive remarks regarding the quality of our prompt engineering, and the acknowledgment of the significance of clinical language processing, particularly in its application to Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). We are also thankful for the reviewer's appreciation of the careful writing of our manuscript and the encouraging feedback on the experimental results.\n\n## Comment 1\nThe study could be strengthened by addressing, e.g., ethical code of conduct with respect to involving clinical experts as annotators in this study and the risks of using ChatGPT to process clinical notes. This could form a broader impact statement in the discussion section. More generally, the study is lacking in its discussion (e.g., limitations of this study and proposed future work).\n\n## Response 1\nWe are thankful for the reviewer's insightful feedback highlighting the need for a more comprehensive discussion in our study. In response, we have extensively revised Section 6 of our manuscript to include these crucial aspects:\n\n**Ethical Considerations**: We have included a detailed discussion on the ethical code of conduct employed in our study, particularly concerning the involvement of clinical experts in the manual annotation of clinical data. This discussion emphasizes the measures taken to ensure ethical compliance and the integrity of the data annotation process.\n\n**Risks of Using LLMs**: The risks associated with using LLMs to process clinical data have been extensively explored. We specifically address concerns regarding privacy leakage and outline potential practices to mitigate such risks. Additionally, we delve into the challenges posed by the \"black-box\" nature of LLMs and their potential for \"hallucination.\" Here, we also highlight the advantages of our SRR prompting in providing the precise rationale, contributing to more reliable and interpretable outputs.\n\n**Limitations and Future Work**: The section further elaborates on the limitations of our current study and maps out potential avenues for future work. This includes expanding our dataset, evaluating domain-specific models pre-trained with EHR data, and exploring the application of our methodology in multilingual corpora.\n\nWe believe that these comprehensive additions and discussions significantly enhance the depth and breadth of our work, effectively addressing the concerns raised by the reviewer.\n\nFor detailed discussions, please refer to Section 6 in the revised version of our manuscript.\n\n## Comment 2\nThe paper could be made stronger by being more specific about the language(s) considered. It is implied that it is limited to English only at its current form.\n\n## Response 2\nWe are grateful for the reviewer's insightful suggestion regarding the evaluation of our methodology in multiple languages.\n\nIn the current scope of our study, our evaluation was primarily conducted using English language texts, constrained largely by the availability of relevant datasets. While we acknowledge that the specifics of our results may differ across different languages, the fundamental intuition behind our SRR strategy will likely hold. Adapting our evaluation framework to include corpora in diverse languages is not only a feasible aim but one that can significantly broaden the scope of our research. This expansion is enabled by the inherent multilingual capabilities of modern LLMs, representing a significant advantage over traditional NLP methodologies.\n\nThese considerations and potential extensions have been discussed in detail in Section 6 of our revised manuscript."

The results of these experiments are summarized below:\n\n| **Method**          | $\\mathcal{Q}^1$ | $\\mathcal{Q}^2$ | $\\mathcal{Q}^3$ |\n|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **Standard Prompt** | 0.56            | 0.52            | 0.55            |\n| **Rationale**       | 0.61            | 0.57            | 0.63            |\n| **JSON**            | 0.82            | 0.75            | 0.84            |\n| **SRR with JSON**   | 0.83     | 0.82   | 0.88   |\n| **YAML**            | 0.71            | 0.61            | 0.66            |\n| **SRR with YAML**   | 0.80   | 0.76  | 0.90   |\n| **INI**             | 0.72            | 0.70            | 0.77            |\n| **SRR with INI**    | 0.81   | 0.77   | 0.83   |\n\nOur SRR prompting consistently enhanced performance compared to the standard prompt, rationale, and standalone structured formats. Echoing the findings from Section 4.5, requesting structured output format significantly impacted performance. Notably, our SRR achieved an average balanced accuracy improvement of 4% with JSON (NRI=0.164, $p=0.539$), 16% with YAML (NRI = 0.736, $p=0.001$), and 7.3% with INI (NRI=0.322, $p=0.181$), across three clinical questions.\n\n*NRI: Net Reclassification Index (NRI) (Pencina et al., 2008)\n\nAdditionally, we experimented with the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) format, as the reviewer suggested. However, the performance of the LLM deteriorated significantly in this case, consistently returning a \"No\" response for all queries. This failure might be attributed to XML\u2019s inherent complexity, potentially leading the LLM to prioritize format accuracy over the correctness of the response.\n\nThese results, along with a detailed discussion, have been added to Section B.1 of our revised manuscript."

For example, it's unclear whether model size plays a significant role in its effectiveness. Furthermore, an error analysis comparing the proposed strategy to other strategies could provide valuable insights. \n\n## Response 1:\nWe are grateful for the insightful feedback. In response, we have expanded our manuscript with **a new discussion in Section 2.3 that delves into the intuition behind our proposed SRR**, particularly its superiority over other reasoning-based prompting methods. \n\nWe added **extensive experimental evaluation** with different structured formats, LLMs, and tasks (Sections B.1, B.2, and B.3), to further clarify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed SRR.\n\nWe also added Section A.4, presenting a **comprehensive error analysis** comparing SRR with other prompting strategies. This analysis offers valuable insights into the effectiveness and limitations of our method.\n\nFor your convenience, the key points from the newly added paragraph in Section 2.3 are as follows:\n\n*LLMs often lack adequate domain-specific clinical knowledge, resulting in unreliable outcomes when LLMs are compelled to reason independently. The issue of forced reasoning is further highlighted by Zero-shot-CoT\u2019s diminished performance with less sophisticated LLMs (Section B.2).*\n\n*In contrast, our Rationale-based intervention, which emphasizes contextual cue identification over explicit deduction, successfully provided the correct answer (Figure 1B). Our approach might lean towards a ``Yes\" classification in cases of uncertainty, potentially increasing false positives (refer to Section A.4). Despite this, our method's superior ability to identify the minority but critical classes demonstrates its reliability. This attribute is particularly valuable in health applications with highly skewed category distributions. Additionally, requesting structured formatting can diminish ambiguity, allowing LLMs to discern the rationale behind inquiries more rapidly, leading to more effective and efficient computational resource allocation, which is crucial for nuanced tasks.*\n\n## Comment 2:\nThe use of the superscript $t$ is not defined or explained in the context of the text.\n\n## Response 2:\nWe added the following sentence in Section 2.1 to explain the superscript $t$:\n\n*The superscript $t$ indicates that the data belongs to the Test cohort $\\mathcal{T}$.*"

Why exactly it is good for private EHR data?\n\n## Response 4:\nWe appreciate the reviewer's critical observation regarding the limitation of our study being evaluated on a single dataset and the question about the applicability of our approach to non-private EHR data.\n\nFirstly, we acknowledge the scarcity of publicly available EHR datasets as noted by Wornow et al. (2023). Additionally, datasets like MIMIC-III/IV, which are publicly available, cannot be shared with LLM APIs provided by companies like OpenAI due to data privacy concerns (https://physionet.org/news/post/415). Moreover, as elaborated in a recent review (Gao et al., 2022), the available datasets do not align well with our research focusing on life-threatening heart rhythm disorders, such as ventricular arrhythmias. Consequently, we concentrated our evaluation on an in-house dataset.\n\nNonetheless, in response to Reviewers QmtS and T6RQ, we extended our evaluation to include the public EHR dataset from the n2c2 De-identification and Smoking Status Challenge 2006, focusing on identifying patient smoking status from medical discharge records (Uzuner et al., 2008). We conducted experiments using GPT-3.5-turbo and designed a standard prompt based on the task description, and further augmented it with Zero-shot-CoT and our Structured Rationale Responses (SRR). The length of the records (1144.68 $\\pm$ 718.77 tokens) precluded the use of few-shot prompting. The performance metrics, as per Uzuner et al. (2008), include macroaveraged and microaveraged F1 scores, as well as Cohen's kappa ($\\kappa$) between LLM responses and ground truth. The results are summarized in the table below:\n\n|             |            | Training Data |      |            | Test Data  |       |\n|---------------------|------------|---------------|------|------------|------------|-------|\n|             | F1 (Macro) | F1 (Micro)    | $\\kappa$    | F1 (Macro) | F1 (Micro) | $\\kappa$     |\n| **Standard Prompt** | 0.16       | 0.24          | 0.26 | 0.33       | 0.48       | 0.29  |\n| **Zero-Shot-CoT**   | 0.58       | 0.78          | 0.57 | 0.50       | 0.75       | 0.51  |\n| **SRR (Ours)**      | 0.63       | 0.73          | 0.60 | 0.57       | 0.66       | 0.52  |\n\nWithout specialized prompting, the LLM struggled to correctly identify smoking status from complex medical discharge records. Unlike VT recurrence, which is nuanced by diverse clinical synonyms, smoking status detection, being more straightforward and reliant on general knowledge, aligns well with the capabilities of Zero-Shot-CoT, which markedly outperformed the standard prompt. Notably, our SRR approach yielded competitive performance to Zero-Shot-CoT, with a higher macroaveraged F1 score and $\\kappa$, indicating a more balanced performance across minority classes, a point elaborated in Section 2.3 of our paper. Importantly, our method also offered a significant reduction in cost and time (approximately 50\\%), by requiring only a single inquiry as opposed to the two-step process required by Zero-Shot-CoT.\n\n\nThese results, along with a detailed discussion, have been added to Section B.3 of our revised manuscript.\n\nReference\n\nMichael Wornow, Yizhe Xu, Rahul Thapa, Birju Patel, Ethan Steinberg, Scott Fleming, Michael A  Pfeffer, Jason Fries, and Nigam H Shah.
