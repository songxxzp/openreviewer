                    "value": "This paper proposes using differential $k$-forms in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to create representations of geometric simplices. Specifically, *neural* $k$-forms are parameterized by MLPs that take geometric information. By then integrating the $k$-forms using the simplicial complex, the authors obtain the *integration matrix*, which can be read out for further processing. The method allows processing simplicial data without the need for (simplicial) message passing. Solid theoretical results are supported with several motivating experiments, opening new directions for future research."

I would encourage them to include as much examples as possible, especially since the full 9 pages were not completely used yet. The authors can gain even more space by e.g. leaving out the introduction to MLPs, which should be familiar for the majority of readers.\n* Experimental details are highly suppressed, it is not quite clear what the inputs, outputs, and learning objective of the experiments are.\n\nMinor:\n* Above eq. 1, you introduce the notation of a convex hull using $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, but before and after you use $v$ and $v_i$ for vertices in $V$. This caused some confusion for me while reading this part. Similarly on page 3 when introduction $k$-vectors.\n* Experiments are mostly limited to the synthetic setting."

It is not quite clear how this function for $k < n$ is well-defined?\n* At equation 9, I was a bit lost how we define $\\phi$. Before eq. 4 we define $\\phi: S \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, but here $\\phi$ seems to take $t \\in \\Delta^k$ which seems more in line with $\\phi|_\\sigma$. Did we suppress some arguments here, or are we assuming something about the elements of $S$?\n* What are the inputs and outputs to your neural networks?  Are the positions of the node locations input as $(\\mathbb{R}^d)^n$ when you have $n$ points, or do you concatenate them?\n* Could you elaborate a bit more on how you go from $\\mathbb{R}^{\\binom{n}{k} \\times \\ell}$, together with the simplicial complex structure, to the integration matrix $X_\\phi(\\beta, \\omega)$? Specifically, in eq. 13, the sum is over all multi-indices, correct? Do we need to know $\\lambda_a$ somehow? \n* Could you discuss the advantages of your method over (simplicial) message passing? Why does it yield better empirical results? Should this method replace message passing altogether, or are there limitations?\n\n\n\n**Final Remarks**. Admittedly I'm lacking some background knowledge to objectively assess the paper. Despite that, I'm really excited about this project. However, I think if the authors put a bit more effort into conceptualizing some core ideas, the paper would improve considerably."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their constructive comments. Judging from their comments, it is clear that the reviewer made a concerted effort to understand the mathematical concepts and provided some excellent questions that helped us clarify the presentation of the math.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n### Answer primary weaknesses\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. We agree with the reviewers comments that the paper could be made more accessible.  We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion of cutting out some of the basic ML definitions, since these should be background for the audience.  We have decided in the revision to globally put more emphasis into explaining the ML aspects of the work in the body of the paper. The trade-off is that we were unable to give a more detailed explanation of the mathematical concepts which we leave for the appendix.\n\n    We have done this in two major revisions. Firstly, we have added a new subsection *Architectures and Parameters* which explains in detail how one can generally construct integration matrices from MLPs, and what the parameters and hyper-parameters of the algorithm are. Judging from the majority of the reviews, the pipeline through which the k-forms are actually used in an ML pipeline was a core concept that was poorly conveyed. We hope that this additional section goes some way to remedy this problem.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. Secondly, as suggested by the reviewer, we have greatly expanded the descriptions of the experiments section in the body to include more details of the implementation. Further, we have tried to provide a more guided curation of how to interpret the results. Our hope is that for readers who are put-off by the technical definitions in the body will now have more chance of grasping the natural and meaning of the synthetic experiments and core ideas.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Answer Minor Weaknesses\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1. Thank you for pointing this out - there were a number of unfortunate typos in the text which we have now clarified. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n2. We think that the graph-learning tasks - nine in total - constitute a large enough sample to argue that our method can be used in practice. For us, the main goal of the paper is to introduce the core concepts, which are quite different to the usual message-passing architectures used in these kinds of tasks and require the majority of the space in the paper. We agree that the method should be tested on a wider and more rigorous framework. However, we propose that this is beyond the scope of this initial, introductory paper."

This is my reason for rating the presentation as \"fair.\" Otherwise, the writing of the paper is good.\n2. Compared to message-passing schemes, the learned k-forms appear to be highly dependent on the particular geometric embedding of the complex, instead of the intrinsic topology/geometry.\n3. The type of tasks considered by the authors are not common ones in the literature, so I am not sure if there is a regime in which the proposed methods can be compared to existing simplicial neural networks, which are largely based on combinatorial, rather than geometric, information. However, there are message-passing graph neural networks that are designed to handle geometric information as well, which the authors did not compare to."
                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. My primary suggestions relate to the writing of the experiments section. There is not sufficient detail in Section 5 to understand each of the experiments. I think it would be better to shorten some of the background material in order to have space for better descriptions of your experiments. In particular:\n\na. Path classification: are the \"paths\" that you classify themselves simplicial complexes? I.e., is the idea to represent each path as a 1-d simplicial complex embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and then integrate against the simplices of the path? I see this to be the case in the appendix, but these details should really be in the main body of the paper for the purpose of readability.\n\nb. Visualizing simplicial Laplacian 1-eigenvectors: the description of this is far too short to understand what is going on here, and the utility of this is questionable. Comparing to the eigenvectors of the simplicial Laplacian is reasonable for the purpose of identifying (co)homological features of the complex, but wouldn't it be better to use neural k-forms to get a proxy for the intrinsic eigenfunctions of some manifold embedded in $R^n$ from which a complex is formed? This experiment needs a lot more motivation.\n\nc. Synthetic surface classification: again, having a description of the dataset in the main body of the paper is needed for readability here. It is fine to leave some details in the appendix, but the body of the paper should be sufficient to get a good understanding of what is going on.\n\n2. I have some questions about invariants that can be incorporated into these networks. As I commented in the weaknesses section, the function learned by neural k-forms is highly dependent on particular geometric embeddings of the simplicial complexes in Euclidean space, as opposed to the intrinsic geometry of the complex. For instance, if I apply a translation to the embedding of the complex, I am likely to get a completely different result when integrating the neural k-form against it. Do you have any comments or insights on handling issues like this? This relates also to your experiment on classifying molecular graphs: the graphs can be geometrically embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but is there a canonical rotation that these embeddings should have? Two identical molecules might be embedded in different ways that yield different results by the network, which is not a property that a message-passing network suffers from. Perhaps a group symmetry should be incorporated for this issue. See the following reference, for instance:\n\nHan, J., Rong, Y., Xu, T., & Huang, W. (2022). Geometrically equivariant graph neural networks: A survey. arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.07230.\n\nI think comparison between neural k-forms and geometric GNNs should be made, in order to yield a fairer picture of where your method stands for graph classification tasks.\n\n3. Can you please comment on whether or not simplicial complexes with non-geometric features could be incorporated into the method you propose? For instance, if the geometric complex not only has an embedding, but also a particular (co)chain supported on it supplied, how would one incorporate that information into a learning pipeline?"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their extremely in-depth and constructive review. In particular, the reviewer\u2019s feedback about the equivariances and embeddings prompted to better clarify that our model explicitly ignores node/simplice embedding information which is equivariant with respect to actions on the ambient space. We realise we did a poor job of conveying this in the original version and have since amended this in the revision. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Answer to Weaknesses\n&nbsp; \n\n1. We note that this was indeed a common criticism amongst the reviewers. We have taken the advice and decided to greatly expand the details of the experiments section.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n2. Our basic premise is that a simplicial complex is itself only a topological object and has no intrinsic geometry. Indeed, for a combinatorial simplicial complex, the standard \u2018geometric realisation\u2019 coming from algebraic topology without an embedding is only a topological space. We argue that in simplicial and graph neural networks the geometry of the simplicial complex is determined by how it is embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$: a space that has a Riemannian structure and notions of distance, angle and geometry.\n\n    Hence our model is dependent on both the particular geometric embedding and the intrinsic combinatorial structure of the graphs and complexes. Indeed the integration matrices, and therefore the cochains and the output as well, are determined by the connections (edges, k-simplices) between the nodes since these connections tell us where exactly to integrate the k-forms. The same set of node positions but with very different connections will yield different cochains\n\n    Most graph message-passing schemes have some non-equivariant component of the node features - for example the atomic weight, one hot encoded atom type, valence in the molecular datasets. In this work, we are interested in only the geometry of these types of features. For example, even when we ignore the \u2018positions\u2019 of the atoms in the molecular graph, we claim that there is still interesting geometry in the node feature space. In the message-passing paradigm, the topology and combinatorics of the complex are then incorporated into how messages are passed. For us, the difference is that the topology and combinatorics are represented as determining the regions of integration (k-simplices) in the embedding space over which learnable k-forms are integrated.\n\n    The question of how to adapt our model to deal with node/complex embeddings that are equivariant in the ambient space - such as the \u2018position\u2019 of atoms in a molecule - is related. For this we ask the reviewer to see our detailed response to Question 2 and the added example on \u2018convolutional 1-form networks\u2019 in the revised appendix *Additional Experiments*.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n3. At least for us the TUDataset for experiments in Table 1 and MoleculeNet datasets in Table seem relatively common in the literature and are recommended in the (Dwivedi et al., 2023) reference. We would be open to suggestions of further datasets on which to evaluate our model given we have an implementation of the architecture ready. \n\n    We have decided to follow the reviewer\u2019s advice on the point of adding an extra point of comparison with a Geometric GNN; namely, the equivariant GNN of (Santorras et. al 2021). As we had poorly conveyed and now stressed in the revised version, our method the equivariant component of node coordinates (such as the positional information) is always omitted from our model. \n\n    The TU datasets in Table 1 have both positional and non-equivariant features from the 1-hot encoding of the atom type. For the GCT, GAT, GIN and our model, the position features were suppressed; the EGNN was provided with the additional equivariant information. We found that the equivariant model did not perform significantly better than the models without the positional information. Curiously the out-of-the-box baseline EGNN model also had significantly more parameters than the others. \n\n    For the larger MoleculeNet dataset, we selected only datasets without equivariant, positional node embeddings so that we could apply our model. While we ran out of time to do this before the revision, we would be happy to run further experiments on larger datasets in MoleculeNet against EGNN that have positional coordinates in addition to non-equivariant coordinates if the reviewer thinks it would significantly improve the paper. The main thrust of this experiment was to show that our method scales drastically better than the standard (non-geometric) GAT, GIN and GCN models."

                        "value": "### Answer weaknesses: \n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for the remarks concerning the experimental comparison. We added EGNN, a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN, in the revision and observed that, despite only using a fraction of the number of parameters, our method is still competitive and often outperforms it. We did not compare to any simplicial neural networks because these networks are not compatible and applicable to our tests\u2014 notice that, for the sake of better comparability, we only use graph classification tasks. Since there is a lack of strong \u2018simplicial\u2019 data sets, we found it best to first remain in the realm of graphs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Answer questions:\n\n&nbsp; \n\nThe learnable parameters are the coefficients in the k-forms modelled as MLPs as well as the layers post integration that can act on the integration matrices. The hyper-parameters are the number of hidden layers and the number of cochains to be learned. The model is composed of multiple steps that come together in the following way: The neural $k$-form as an MLP provides a function that can be evaluated point-wise on the embedding space of the graph, however point-wise evaluation of the output is not interesting as it does not tell us anything about the graph or simplicial complex structure. Thus through integration of the k-form on the region of integration determined by the $k$-simplices (a deterministic process without learnable parameters), we can transform the point-wise information into cochains, yielding the integration matrix. The integration matrix can then be processed by further layers that will provide the output prediction. This prediction is used to update the model. The integration part can be understood as an operation that \u201caggregates\u201d the information of the neural k-form with respect to the structure of the graph. \n\nGiven the concerns you raised we have taken two steps to ensure that the details are clear to the reader. Firstly, we have provided a detailed subsection regarding the general architecture and parameters in Section 3. Secondly, we have expanded the explanation of experiments in the body of the paper which we believe gives useful examples of how the basic architecture can be implemented in practice."

A detailed answer to the weaknesses and questions can be found below as well as a description of the changes made to the paper accordingly. In the manuscript the main changes have been added in blue for more clarity. \n&nbsp;\n\n\n### Answer weaknesses: \n&nbsp;\n\n1. After the helpful comments from yourself and the other reviewers, we realise that we could have done a better job of stressing how the graph/simplicial structure determines its vector representation. The graph information is incorporated as follows: the nodes are embedded in the ambient feature space and the edges (1-simplices) serve as regions of integration for 1-forms. Thus, if the edge structure changes, the 1-forms will be integrated over a different region, and produce a different vector representation of the graph. For example, two graphs with the same embedded nodes but different edges can have dramatically different integrals against the same form. \n\nIt is true that if the node embeddings are relatively uninteresting geometrically - for example, one hot encoding of atom types etc. - the simplicial regions of integration are a bit less intuitive. However, the integral can still be calculated in the same manner, and despite the \u2018discreteness\u2019 of the node embeddings the method performs well. When moving to higher-dimensional, real-valued scalar node features the method indeed performs much better, and overall we agree with your intuition that real-valued, node embeddings are preferable as inputs for our algorithm. &nbsp;\n\n\n2. Indeed the computational cost of integrating $k$-forms with $k>2$ becomes quite expensive. Given the results in this paper we believe that an important next step to this paper would be to better develop the computational aspect of this method in higher dimensions. One possible trick that we could use is the isomorphism between 2-forms and 1-forms in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which in theory should speed up computing surface integrals for surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ considerably. We plan to investigate this in future work. &nbsp;\n\n3. For the moment, we have decided to focus on classification only due to space constraints in the paper. However, the method could easily be adapted for node prediction and we put this as future work. For example, one could integrate a set of 1-forms across the local 1-neighbourhood of each node to produce a vectorization that could serve as basis for node-based learning tasks. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n### Answers to questions &nbsp;\n\n1. We opted to restrict benchmarking to graph classification, since it has a more established benchmarking framework. This was the approach taken by one of the main papers on simplicial neural networks, Bodnar et. al [1]. We did not directly compare to this framework, but based on the reported results in that paper it is likely our algorithm is competitive with them. &nbsp; \n\n[1]  Bodnar, C., Frasca, F., Wang, Y., Otter, N., Montufar, G.F., Li\u00f3, P. &, Bronstein, M..

Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning, in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 139:1026-1037 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/bodnar21a.html. &nbsp;\n\n\n2. Yes! This is entirely feasible and in our view an exciting future direction. Due to questions raised by this reviewer and others we have decided to include an example of convolutional 1-form network in the *Additional Experiments* section in the appendix and how this addresses the reviewer\u2019s question."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments and the careful reading of our manuscript. Similar comments about the architecture of the method have been made by other reviewers. We have addressed these comments in the new version of the manuscript. The main changes have been incorporated in blue for an easier overview. Below we answer the specific comments and questions detailing the changes we have made.  \n&nbsp;\n\n\n### Answer to weaknesses: \n\n1. The fact that our algorithm produces a representation without message-passing is a basic property of the architecture. This seems to have been lost in our presentation of the paper, since many of the reviewers seemed confused about this point. We have added a new section called *Architecture and Parameters* to clarify how the procedure works in practice. \n\n    Simplicial message-passing (see Bodnar et al. [1]) layers take a matrix of cochains as input, and produce another matrix of cochains as output before readout and downstream analysis. The representations of each simplex correspond to rows of this matrix when it is in the standard basis of simplicial chains. The point is that our algorithm replaces message passing by generating a matrix of cochains via integration matrices independently of any message passing. We have put this in the paper just above Remark 8 at the end of the new section to clarify, and hope that it addresses the reviewer\u2019s concerns.\n&nbsp;\nWe agree with the reviewers comment regarding the last line in Remark 5 and have removed it from the paper.\n\n[1]  Bodnar, C., Frasca, F., Wang, Y., Otter, N., Montufar, G.F., Li\u00f3, P. & Bronstein, M.. (2021). Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Topological: Message Passing Simplicial Networks. Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning, in Proceedings of Machine Learning Research 139:1026-1037 Available from https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/bodnar21a.html.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n2. Again, since many reviewers found it difficult to understand the general architecture, we have expanded on the figure by adding a whole sub-section *Architecture and Parameters* in Section 3. \n\n\n3. It is slightly unclear whether the reviewer is referring to the dimensionality of the node embedding or the dimensionality of the form. For high dimensional node embeddings, 1-form computations are still efficient as shown in our real-world graph case. \n\n    We understand the general concerns about showing higher dimensional form examples. We have decided to benchmark the method on well-known graph data sets as is usually done in the graph learning community. We  show an example as a proof of concept with $2$-forms and $2$-dimensional complexes, to show how the method works in the higher dimensional case. Unfortunately data sets with higher dimensional structure are not widely available and rarely used as benchmarks hence the decision of having only an synthetic example for the higher dimensional case. In addition we believe that the difficult step in understanding the theory behind our model was going from one dimension to any dimensions higher than 1. Understanding and visualization of 2-dimensional objects being easier to communicate about, we decided to keep the proof of concept to two dimensions only, as a way to show that one can go from simple 1-dimensional case  to more complicated multidimensional cases. \n\n    About the performance, we believe that the strength of our method is due to its geometric foundations. In the experiments shown in Table 1 the point is not only that our model performs better than or similar to other models, but also that the number of parameters needed is smaller, this aspect is even more prevalent in the second set of experiments (Table 2) where not only the number of parameters is significantly smaller than other standard models but our method performs the tasks much better. \n&nbsp;"
