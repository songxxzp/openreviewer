The authors argue that existing invariant learning methods learn invariant subgraphs directly through data labels, which is obviously wrong.\n\nThe reason why invariant learning can capture invariant features is mainly based on the following two assumptions:\n\n1. Training data comes from multiple environments, and model can infer the environment labels from the data distributions.\n2. The assumption of graph generation process: graph data is composed of stable (invariant) features and environmental (shortcut) features.\nThe stable features have two important properties:\n- Sufficiency: Stable features contain sufficient information of the label of the target data.\n- Invariance: The prediction of stable features remains unchanged in any environments.\n\nThe main contribution of this paper is to expose the flaws of these methods, but provide a completely wrong argument.\nWhy the method proposed in this article can learn invariant subgraphs, the author does not give any reasonable assumptions or theoretical explanations."

The method mainly builds on existing techniques, i.e. graph pooling [1] and graph contrastive learning [2]. And improving graph representation learning with clustering and subgraphs is not a novel idea, which has been mentioned in many previous works [3,4]. The authors should refer to, discuss, and compare these works.\n2. The proposed framework lacks theoretical support.\n3. In realistic scenarios, the invariant relational may be a disconnected subgraph, such as several dispersed functional groups in molecules, which cannot be captured by a single connected subgraph as in the proposed method.\n4. The authors only adopted the graph datasets from the synthetic, nlp, and cv domains. Further evaluating the model on several widely used datasets from bioinformatics and social network domains [5] will improve the quality of the paper.\n\n[1] Spectral clustering with graph neural networks for graph pooling.

Have the authors looked at the model results for Graph-SST5, Twitter and CMNIST beyond accuracy? What kind of subgraphs were found and did they make sense in the context of the original data?\n\n4. There were some components that seemed somewhat unnecessarily complicated. For example, parts of section 3.4.1 looked similar to spectral clustering/graph cut or modularity in community detection.
