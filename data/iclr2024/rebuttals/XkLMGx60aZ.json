For this task, they discuss a genetic algorithm based approach to identify the optimal distribution. A neural network (U-Net) is used to estimate the impact of placement of each tree on aggregate MRT. This U-Net is used to approximate a process-based model that estimates point-wise MRT based on meteorological and vegetation features. A counterfactual-based analysis is also carried out, where optimal placement of even existing trees are considered in addition to new ones."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our paper and raising interesting points. We are glad that the reviewer acknowledges that our work \u201cconsiders a novel spatial optimization problem with a very relevant application\u201d. Below, we address the concerns and questions of the reviewer.\n\n### W1,W4: ML contribution & missing evaluation\n\nWe kindly refer the reviewer to Section 4.1 that thoroughly compares our method to SOLWEIG. Next, we provide further details about the computational speed-ups of our method: we report speed-ups of factors of 30, 17, 44000, and 400000 for the time periods: day, week, year, or decade, respectively, when comparing using our model that directly outputs the aggregated mean radiant temperature to first predicting the mean radiant temperature for each time step and then aggregating over all time steps. Note that using deep learning methods compared to physical modeling with SOLWEIG achieves another factor of ca. 22x [1]. Note that prior works exclusively used physical simulation models. To contextualize the amount of speed-up we gain, let us consider an example: consider that the optimization takes 1 minute with our method and optimizes the tree positions for the time period decade. Consequently, the estimated runtime for SOLWEIG would be 1 min\\*400000\\*22=ca. 16.73 years.\n\nAs mentioned by the reviewer, the main contribution of our work is the introduction of a \u201cnovel spatial optimization problem with a very relevant application\u201d. Prior work mostly focused just on computational efficiency or improved modeling, i.e., improving the forward direction. In contrast, we consider the backward direction, i.e., making interventions in the input to optimize some physical quantity, i.e., in our case reducing the mean radiant temperature. Besides that we do *not* use it as a surrogate model but learn to directly predict aggregated results which goes beyond a simple replacement.\n\n### W2, Q1: Sequential or joint optimization\n\nAfter greedily placing trees subsequently, the iterative search jointly optimizes all tree positions. We note that sequential placements would incur significantly more computational costs and, thus, we did not run such.\n\nThanks for pointing out the missing evaluation in the algorithm. We indeed need to evaluate the new candidate. We fixed the algorithm in the revised manuscript.\n\n### W3, Q3: Simplifying assumptions\n\nWe note that many limitations could be overcome in future work. The main issue for most limitations is the data bottleneck, i.e., the data often is not available, or limitations of physical modeling (refer to Appendix C for more details in the revised manuscript). Both could be overcome by future advances in easier access, e.g., by means of estimating them through satellite imagery, as well as advances in physical modeling.\n\n### Q2: Model architecture choice\n\nOur approach is not specific to the model architecture. The goal of our work is not just to show good numbers but to outline a novel optimization problem that uses deep learning approaches for the optimization of physical quantities. Consequently, the model architecture is a non-important implementation detail in our opinion and future work could improve upon it.\n\n--- \n\n[1] Briegel, Ferdinand, et al. \"Modelling long-term thermal comfort conditions in urban environments using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder as a computational shortcut.\" Urban Climate 2023."

Does the CityGML data come from [this](https://www.ogc.org/standard/CityGML/) homepage and is this all simulation data, or real observations? As far as I know, ERA5 data is only available on 30m resolution; how do you get to 1m resolution? Where do your digital elevation and surface models, your land cover, wall aspects and height, and sky view factor maps come from?\n2. Benchmarking traditional physical model would be highly appreciated to understand the performance of your U-Net in terms of accuracy. That is, does your method incur a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and, in particular, how accurate is your U-Net to approximate $T_{mrt}$?\n3. Is SOLVEIG a traditional model and do you benchmark this? Please help readers by clarifying this more thoroughly. What does an `L1 error of 1.93K` mean, is it computed between U-Net output and ground truth, or between U-Net output and SOLVEIG output?\n5. Given that the solar incoming radiation $I_g$ has the biggest impact, how does the tree position make a difference? An ablation comparing the effect on $T_{mrt}$ caused by number of trees vs. the positioning of the trees would be interesting. Also, seing Figure 4, I do not quite agree that the number of trees saturates (although it certainly will at some point). In short: Does the number of trees or their position contribute more to a better $T_{mrt}$? (I have seen your comment `Notably, the improvement by relocation of existing trees is significantly larger than the effect of 50 added trees [...]`, but I could not quite understand the quantitative effect of each treatment, i.e., #trees vs position)."

Have you considered other tree positioning approaches, such as projecting error gradients in the U-Net's $T_{mrt}$ prediction on the positions of the trees? That is, somewhat similarly to [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09019), where optimal node-positioning was optimized via gradients in a GNN.\n3. What type of trees have been investigated? To what kind of tree does $t_g$ used in your experiments relate?\n4. Why does your algorithm suggest to populate east-to-west passages more densely? Wouldn't this prevent wind to transport hot air out of the city in summer? And following up on this, what tree positions does your algorithm predict when exclusively optimizing for winter or summer months?"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our work. We are glad that the reviewer acknowledges that our manuscript is \u201csound\u201d and that the \u201cresults of the experiments support the claims\u201d.\n\n### Originality; new insights\n\nWe would like to kindly remind the reviewer that this work was submitted to an applications track, where the primary goal is to showcase the application of recent deep learning methods to *innovative problem setups*. Unlike the majority of previous works which focus on computational efficiency gains or refining forward modeling, our paper targets a distinctive direction. Our emphasis lies in the use of deep learning to actively optimize an important physical parameter of the real-world, i.e., in our example the improvement of outdoor human thermal comfort. Note that our problem formulation extends beyond this example, i.e., essentially it boils down to making physically meaningful interventions to achieve some goal.\n\nBesides the aforementioned, we would briefly like to note that our work is the first to optimize tree locations to reduce the mean radiant temperature over time spans of weeks or even entire decades. This also allows us to investigate the effect of optimized tree locations over longer time periods (Section 4.3). Overall, we believe that our work may provide an interesting example of how to utilize advancements in deep learning to *actively* support in solving challenging real-world optimization problems.\n\n### Focus on one city\n\nWe openly acknowledge this as a limitation (also refer to our limitations section). However, note that SOLWEIG has been successfully applied to various cities across the world with distinct local climatic regions. Consequently, we are confident that our approach will also work for other climatic regions. However, we hope that the reviewer understands that getting the respective data is unfortunately challenging. Future advancements in estimating the needed data from, e.g., satellite imagery, may overcome this data bottleneck. Lastly, we chose five areas with distinct characteristics and found that our approach works across all of them.\n\n### W1: Where does the data come from?\n\nWe obtained the pre-processed data from Briegel et al [1]; refer for details to them. They were provided with spatial data and obtained past meteorological measurements from the internet. The input data is real data (from the point in time it was recorded) but mean radiant temperatures were simulated with SOLWEIG, as recording real measurements of mean radiant temperature is challenging (see below for a brief discussion on why).\n\nRegarding ERA5 data: ERA5 Land data has a spatial resolution of ca. 9km x 9km, nor does it contain mean radiant temperatures. Please refer to [2] for further details. Note that all study areas are within the same ERA5 Land grid cell. This means, all study areas have the same global meteorological forcing data. Thus, we consider it as constant within our 500m x 500m areas.\n\n### W2: Comparisons to traditional physical models\n\nWe compare our modeling with SOLWEIG in Section 4.1. We find that the U-Net to SOLWEIG error (i.e., 1.93K) is smaller  than the previously found errors of SOLWEIG to real sparse measurements (i.e., 4.4K; refer to Table 5 in [1]). Consequently, it indicates that U-Net is a well-suited computational shortcut and does not (or perhaps a negligible) trade-off between modeling performance and efficiency. Note that this is not typically the case when replacing a physical model with some data-driven approach.\n\n### W3: Questions about SOLWEIG and evaluation\n\nYes, SOLWEIG is a popular physical simulation model for estimation of mean radiant temperature. We provide details on SOLWEIG in Appendix C.\n\nRegarding the L1 error: it is computed between the U-Net\u2019s and SOLWEIG\u2019s estimation. Note that obtaining real measurements of mean radiant temperatures is difficult and monetarily expensive, as both short- and longwave radiation from six directions need to be measured. In addition, such measurements can only be made for single points, which in turn makes comprehensive evaluation over an entire spatial area challenging.\n\n### W4: Comparison of #trees vs. positioning (optimization)\n\nWe added a comparison of the effect of planting more trees vs. optimizing or not optimizing their position in Appendix F.3. The results highlight the importance of our optimization, i.e., not optimizing would only harness ca. 50% of their potential in reducing mean radiant temperatures.\n\n--- \n\n[1] Briegel, Ferdinand, et al. \"Modelling long-term thermal comfort conditions in urban environments using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder as a computational shortcut.\" Urban Climate 2023.\n\n[2] https://confluence.ecmwf.int/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=74764925"

                        "value": "### Q1: Figure 1 legend\n\nIt is the difference between the status quo to the status after planting an additional 50 trees. We added green crosses in the figures to indicate the tree positions.\n\n### Q2: Gradient-based optimization\n\nYes, but it yielded very poor results. We mainly attribute this to the fact the discretization step was causing issues. We believe modeling mean radiant temperature with a GNN may be fruitful for future work and would allow for such an optimization.\n\n### Q3: Type of tree\n\nWe note that current physical simulation models, such as SOLWEIG, are not capable of distinguishing types of tree. We added a list of limitations of the physical model SOLWEIG in Appendix C to make ML experts aware of such limitations that our approach consequently inherits. Our approach would benefit from advances in incorporating such in physical modeling with SOLWEIG.\n\n### Q4: Discussion of experimental results\nOur study focuses on mean radiant temperature and, thus, does not consider other effects, such as wind, air temperature or humidity. Thus, we outlined this limitation in Section 5 and proposed it as a next step to integrate them. For example, one could extend our approach to UTCI, a popular thermal comfort index that also includes such factors.\n\nWe optimized tree positions for winter and summer months and provided the additional results in Appendix F.2. We find that trees are predominantly positioned in larger, open areas and clustered together during the summer, whereas they are more broadly spread over the neighborhood during the winter."

Given that this quantity is expensive to evaluate using e.g. physical simulations, the authors propose training a convolutional neural network to estimate the quantity instead. Furthermore, the estimation is performed in an aggregated fashion, which can yield substantial speed-ups while sacrificing an acceptable amount of accuracy. \n\nThe authors pair this estimation of the objective with a heuristic local search technique comprising several components. The method is applied to the optimization of tree placements within a city, and shows improved performance over either component in isolation. Furthermore, there are interesting insights regarding the impact of tree cover on temperature as a function of time, the diminishing impact of additional trees, and the \"what-if\" scenario concerning the impact of an alternative, optimized placement over the one that currently exists."

In my opinion, the methodological contributions of the paper are thin, and essentially boil down to 1) estimating the aggregated radiant temperatures directly instead of individually and 2) integrating this estimation in a standard local search procedure. These are both fairly straightforward. The \"theoretical analysis\" in Section 3.1 is extremely tenuous and, in my opinion, should not be branded as such.\n\n**W2**. The evaluation does not include error bars and confidence intervals, which are a must for drawing reliable conclusions from the results, given the stochasticity of the methods (bar greedy search which is deterministic; but given the estimation itself is learned, one could consider an experimental design where the \"seed\" for the estimation varies in a paired fashion).\n\n**W3**. There is a potential fundamental limitation in the considered objective, which does not include any measure of population density, traffic, or footfall for the areas. \n\n- In my opinion, this is potentially problematic as the optimization procedure may find solutions where trees are placed in places that yield good deltas in the temperature metric, and yet are comparatively less (or not at all) populated. \n- Hence, the placements may trivially not lead to decreases in thermal comfort experienced by individuals, given that an area is not actually frequented by people. \n- This is potentially alluded to in the text (bottom of page 8) and acknowledged in Section 5, but I think it deserves to be addressed in more depth. \n- For example, it may be that the density is sufficiently uniform in the considered grid that this is not an issue. Evidence that the approach does not \"game\" the objective would also counteract this point."

We are happy that the reviewer finds that our work \u201caddresses a relevant, practical problem of potential societal impact\u201d and some of our analyses \u201cinsightful\u201d. Below, we address the concerns and questions of the reviewer.\n\n### W1: Methodological contribution\n\nOur work aims to formulate a problem that can be solved by deep learning techniques. Compared to previous works in physical modeling with deep learning that (*passively*) typically just aimed at computational efficiency or improved modeling in the forward direction, we instead take an *active* position by optimizing the input s.t. it optimizes a physical measure to achieve a certain goal (backward direction).\n\n### W2: Error bars\n\nAs suggested by the reviewer, we have added error bars for the optimization of trees in our comparison of optimization strategies (Table 1). It clearly shows the superiority of our optimization method above common baselines for black-box optimization.\n\n### W3: Missing factors, such as population density, etc.\n\nWe also agree this is a limitation (as discussed in the limitations section). However, this is not a limitation of our method. Indeed, we can integrate such factors into the objective function if such data (e.g., the population density) is available. Consequently, it can be ensured that trees are planted in areas, in which they effectively improve the thermal comfort of individuals where they reside. \n\n### C1: Comparisons to prior works; contextualization of the speed-ups\n\nNote that prior work only used areas of sizes of ca. 50m x 80m [1] or 30m x 80m [2], i.e., our study areas are roughly two orders of magnitude larger. Further, they optimized for a maximum number of 8 [1] or 14 [2] trees, whereas we optimized for up to 200 trees. This makes our approach hardly comparable to prior work.\n\nRegarding the computational speed-ups of our method: we further report speed-ups of factors of 30, 17, 44000, and 400000 for the time periods: day, week, year, or decade, respectively, when comparing using our model that directly outputs the aggregated mean radiant temperature to first predicting the mean radiant temperature for each time step and then aggregating over all time steps. Note that using deep learning methods compared to physical modeling with SOLWEIG achieves another factor of ca. 22x [1]. Note that prior works exclusively used physical simulation models. To contextualize the amount of speed-up we gain, let us consider an example: consider that the optimization takes 1 minute with our method and optimizes the tree positions for the time period decade. Consequently, the estimated runtime for SOLWEIG would be 1 min\\*400000\\*22=ca. 16.73 years.\n\n--- \n\n[1] Wallenberg, Nils, Fredrik Lindberg, and David Rayner. \"Locating trees to mitigate outdoor radiant load of humans in urban areas using a metaheuristic hill-climbing algorithm\u2013introducing TreePlanter v1. 0.\" Geoscientific Model Development 2022.\n\n[2] Stojakovic, Vesna, et al. \"The influence of changing location of trees in urban green spaces on insolation mitigation.\" Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 2020.\n\n[3] Briegel, Ferdinand, et al. \"Modelling long-term thermal comfort conditions in urban environments using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder as a computational shortcut.\" Urban Climate 2023."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time and raising constructive criticisms. We are glad that the reviewer appreciates our presentation and acknowledges that our \u201cclaims are backed by theoretical analysis and detailed experiments.\u201d Below, we address the reviewer\u2019s concerns and questions.\n\n### Additional technical description\n\nWe revised the manuscript and, e.g., added missing explanations of the hill-climbing algorithm. We would provide further feedback if the reviewer sees other parts that may require improvement.\n\n### Novelty in narrow application area\n\nWe would like to note that the majority of previous work on physical modeling focused on improving computational efficiency or improved modeling in the forward modeling. Our work instead focuses on finding interventions in the input, i.e., locations of trees, to optimize a physical quantity (backward direction). Our case study extends beyond the scope of the presented application area and may provide an interesting direction for future work in using deep learning approaches to support humans in challenging optimization problems.\n\n### 500m x 500m is not a large neighborhood; what area is covered by previous work, and missing state-of-the-art\n\nWe kindly disagree. Note that prior work only used areas of sizes of ca. 50m x 80m [1] or 30m x 80m [2], i.e., our study areas are roughly two orders of magnitude larger. Further, they optimized for a maximum number of 8 [1] or 14 [2] trees, whereas we optimized for up to 200 trees. This makes our approach hardly comparable to prior work.\n\n### Missing dataset details and HP tuning\n\nThanks for pointing this out! We added the missing dataset details in Appendix B. Note that we did not perform hyperparameter tuning. We believe future work could already improve performance by optimizing the hyperparameters.\n\n### Cost comparison of planting new trees vs. transferring existing trees\n\nWe hope the reviewer understands that a cost comparison is out-of-scope for this work and may depend on many parts that are hard to control for. Nonetheless, we would like to point the reviewer to Section 4.4 that showcases that we could significantly better utilize the potential of urban trees by moving them to \u201cbetter-suited\u201d locations in terms of reduction in mean radiant temperature. This may be of interest in the consideration whether planting new trees or transferring existing ones is the most cost-efficient solution for a given city.\n\n### Correlation value between mean radiant temperature and mortality\n\nWe kindly refer the reviewer to Table 1 and Figure 3 of Thorsson et al. [3] for details.\n\n\n### I did not understand how the aggregated performance is worse than point prediction, the absolute number is lower\n\nWe compared the direct prediction of aggregated mean radiant temperature against making predictions for every time step and then aggregating the results. We did not compare with SOLWEIG\u2019s results, as it is prohibitively expensive for our larger time periods (year & decade), and wanted to stay consistent within our comparisons. Below, we provide comparisons of the results of aggregated performance compared to SOLWEIG for both smaller time periods (day & week) that make clear why making point prediction and then aggregating is slightly better, though computationally significantly more expensive.\n\n| type | day | week |\n| :- | :-: | -: |\n| nonaggregated         | 1.32        | 0.98         |\n| aggregated         | 1.48         | 1.07         |\n\n### Isn't it a good thing that the temperature increases during nights and winters when the environment is colder?\n\nYes, this is indeed the case and it is beneficial. The effect can be seen in Figure 3. We did not delve into this deeper, as we chose to focus on mean radiant temperature reduction for combating heat stress.\n\n--- \n\n[1] Wallenberg, Nils, Fredrik Lindberg, and David Rayner. \"Locating trees to mitigate outdoor radiant load of humans in urban areas using a metaheuristic hill-climbing algorithm\u2013introducing TreePlanter v1. 0.\" Geoscientific Model Development 2022.\n\n[2] Stojakovic, Vesna, et al. \"The influence of changing location of trees in urban green spaces on insolation mitigation.\" Urban Forestry & Urban Greening 2020.\n\n[3] Thorsson, Sofia, et al. \"Mean radiant temperature\u2013A predictor of heat related mortality.\" Urban Climate 2014."
