                    "value": "This paper makes contributions to the theoretical understanding of the adversarial examples. The authors use kernel theory, Mercer\u2019s theorem in particular, to explain the adversarial examples. Specifically, the authors first prove that adversarial examples shift the Mercer\u2019s spectrum of the empirical kernel so that the near-zero density of the Mercer eigenvalues is high. Extending the first theorem, the authors also explain the reason for the denseness of adversarial examples, i.e., adversarial examples are unlikely to appear in the test set, but they exist near every test sample. Lastly, the authors demonstrate their findings with small experiments."

Minor comments\n    - According to the [formatting instruction](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2024.zip), in-text citations (`\\citet`) and citations in parentheses (`\\citep`) should be used differently, but I see only in-text citations in the paper writing. Please fix the citation style.\n    - I don\u2019t think that Figure 1 is the best way to show the eigenvalue distributions. Why do you waste space by having a y-axis ranging from 0 to 1?"

The authors should perform similar experiments with other attack methods.\n\nAnswer: As pointed out in Section 7, additional experiments would indeed be beneficial. Please note, however, that our theory is independent from the characteristics of the data as well as of the adversarial attack method. We chose DeepFool as a widely-known algorithm simply for illustrative purposes. The power of the attack method does not affect our theory: as long as one is able to find an adversarial example for the task at hand, it can be described by our framework.\n\nQuestion: I cannot understand the reason for the assumption on the layer widths, i.e., all layers except the last layer have the same width $N$, because the proof mainly uses the empirical feature map that does not involve the intermediate layer output. Is this assumption necessary for the theorem? If so, how do you justify the assumption on the layer width?\n\nAnswer: You are correct in noticing this unnecessary simplification, which was in place only to avoid\ncumbersome notation.

The paper then proves that, for this definition of an adversarial example, the eigenvalues of the eigenfunctions of the Mercer's kernel vanish. Equivalently, $\\lim_{t\\to0}\\int_t^\\infty\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\mathrm{d}\\mu(\\lambda)=\\infty$. Next, the previous theorem is utilized to show that the measure of adversarial examples vanishes as $\\epsilon\\to0$.\n\nGiven the computational constraints, the predictions of the theorems are verified empirically by considering a binary classification of 0 and 1 digits in the MNIST dataset."

Based on a definition of adversarial examples in section 2, the paper proves Theorem 1 showing that when the attack radius $\\epsilon$ is approaching $0$ the existence of an adversarial example means the density function of the kernel eigenvalues divided by $\\lambda^2$ is not integrable and uses this result to show in the limit case $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$ the adversarial examples have zero probability.

                    "value": "1- The paper's presentation should be improved. The theory sections are abstract and hard to follow in their current form. I think this is because the authors present the results in the most general and abstract way possible and also include the theorem proofs in the text, which makes the paper difficult to read for an average machine learning researcher. I suggest the authors postpone the proofs to an appendix and discuss some corollaries and examples of the theorems for some basic kernel functions. \n\n2- Theorem 1 is an asymptotic result and holds when the attack radius $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$. I think this could limit the implications of the theorem. Also, it seems that in Theorem 1 the bound on $\\epsilon$ in the limit statement depends on the choice of adversarial example $x'$ which means the asymptotic guarantee would not uniformly hold for all $\\epsilon\\le \\epsilon_0$ with $\\epsilon_0$ being independent of adversarial example $x'$.\n\n3- The definitions and notations in sections 2 and 3 are in some cases vague and raise questions: a) In the definition of adversarial examples, what is function $f(\\epsilon)$? The definition does not specify function $f$ and only states the condition $\\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0}f(\\epsilon) = \\infty$, which would be problematic because for a fixed $\\epsilon >0$  we can always find a function $f$ for observed data that makes the definition hold for a perturbed $x'$. Also, in the proofs of Theorem 1,2 do the authors determine the function $f$ based on the dataset $X, y$ or is the choice of $f$ independent of $X,y$? \n\nb) In Theorem 1, what is the definition of $P_{X'}$ (with the prime)? Is it the delta function on $x'$ or a continuous density function related to data distribution $P_X$? \n\nc) I wonder what the authors precisely mean when they say \"In the limit $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$, .... \" in Theorems 1,2. Does that mean there is an $\\epsilon_0 >0$ independent of the choice of $x'$ such that the statement holds for every $\\epsilon\\le \\epsilon_0$? (clarification on  weakness 2)\n\nd) As another question, what is the precise mathematical definition of \"such that $|| x- x'||\\le \\epsilon$ for some example $(x^*,y)\\sim p$\"? If $p$ is a continuous distribution, then every point in $p$'s sample space has zero probability so whether $(x^*,y)$ is in the support set of $p$ or not does not change its zero likelihood to be sampled from $p$.

Is it the delta function on $\\mathbf{x}'$ or a continuous density function related to data distribution $p_{\\mathbf{X}'}$?\n\nAnswer: The definition of \\emph{empirical probability distribution} for a dataset is provided in Section 2 at the end of the paragraph on empirical feature maps; it is essentially a summation of Dirac deltas. It's important to note that this definition is generic, and applicable to any design matrix (in particular to $\\mathbf{X}')$. The notation $\\mathbf{X}' = \\mathbf{X} : \\mathbf{x}'$ represents the concatenation of matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and vector $\\mathbf{x}'$, as described also in Section 2.\n\n\nQuestion: I wonder what the authors precisely mean when they say \"In the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, .... \" in Theorems 1,2. Does that mean there is an $\\epsilon_0 > 0$ independent of the choice of $\\mathbf{x}'$ such that the statement holds for every $\\epsilon \\leq \\epsilon_0$? \n\nAnswer: It implies the existence of an $\\epsilon_0$ such that the statement holds for all $0 <\\epsilon \\leq \\epsilon_0$.

If $p$ is a continuous distribution, then every point in $p$'s sample space has zero probability so whether $(\\mathbf{x}^*, y^*)$ is in the support set of $p$ or not does not change its zero likelihood to be sampled from $p$.\n\nAnswer: Each individual point has probability zero but not a zero \\emph{probability density}.\n For instance, in a Gaussian density, each real number has a probability of zero when sampled as a specific event; however, it's essential to note that each real number does have a non-zero probability density.\nThe statement\n$(\\mathbf{x}^*, y^*) \\sim p$ \nsimply means that point $(\\mathbf{x}^*, y^*)$ is sampled according to the same joint probability density $p$ as that of the training data."

Do not hesitate to ask should these modifications not adequately address your comments.\n\nQuestion: Are there geometric interpretations that your theory provides?\n\nAnswer: We briefly mentioned the geometric interpretation of our results in Section 6, paragraph 4.

On the negative side, I tend to agree with Reviewer YsYz that the experiments are currently a bare minimum. On the positive side, the paper introduces a nice framework in which to analyze adversarial examples (through the lens of the empirical kernel).\n\nI am willing to slightly raise my score, and encourage the authors to continue to refine the draft if the paper is not accepted."
