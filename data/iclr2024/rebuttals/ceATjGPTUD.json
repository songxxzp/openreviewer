                    "value": "In a previous study, generative error correction (GER) is achieved by learning the mapping from ASR N-best hypotheses to ground-truth transcription through efficient LLM finetuning. This paper extends this idea and focuses on noisy conditions. To avoid the cross-modality gap, the authors propose a novel idea to extract a language-space noise embedding from the N-best list to represent the noise conditions of source speech. Furthermore, in order to enhance its representation ability of audio noise, a knowledge distillation (KD) approach via mutual information estimation (MINE) is employed. The experiments show that the proposed method can significantly outperform the conventional LM rescoring baseline. Several additional experiments are also included in the Appendix which provide more insight into the proposed RobustGER. Overall, the paper is very clear and well-written. It describes the problem and explains the solution well. The experiments done are reflective of the proposed model's performance."

This may only make sense for the Whisper ASR, as a recent paper [r1] pointed out that the noise-robustness of Whisper does not come from noise-invariant, but recognizes speech conditioned on the noise type. In summary, the Whisper encoder is a suitable model to extract noise information. On the other hand, other ASR models may not have such ability and they achieve noise-robustness through the noise-invariant encoder. If this is the case, those ASR encoders may not be suitable to extract audio noise embedding. A discussion and simple experiment about this would be great.\n\n\n[r1] Gong, Y., Khurana, S., Karlinsky, L., & Glass, J. (2023).

                        "value": "We appreciate Reviewer nSVq for considering our work is clear, novel, and solid and very thank your reviewing efforts and advice. Your comments for improvement are professional and constructive. Please find the responses below:\n\n- ***Q1: Whisper encoder is a suitable model to extract noise information. On the other hand, other ASR models may not have such ability. A discussion and simple experiment about this would be great.***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. We agree with you that Whisper encoder is better than other encoders for audio noise embedding extraction. We have added an experiment on CHiME-4 in Table 17 (Appendix), which compares Whisper encoder with WavLM encoder and Wav2vec2 encoder. Results on audio-space denoising shows that Whisper encoder performs better than WavLM and Wav2vec2, which verifies the claim above. However, since audio denoising itself does not perform well in our experiments, we may need more studies to compare these ASR encoders for noise information extraction, which we would like to leave for future work. Thanks again for bringing up this topic.\n\n- ***Q2: As pointed out on page 5, the noise embedding is calculated by their diversity \u201csimilar to variance\u201d, however in eq (4) and (6), the sentence embedding differences are simply summed, so I guess an abs or square operation is needed ? In the appendix page 16, you mentioned that the dimension of language-space noise embedding E_LN is N(N-1)xD_sbert. Could you explain where N(N-1) comes from? I cannot see this dimension from eq (4) and (6).***\n\n  Thanks for pointing out this. We apologize for making you confused, and we have removed the term \u201csimilar to variance\u201d. \n\n  As for Eq.(4) and (6), we also make a mistake (sorry again), please kindly refer to our updated manuscript, it should be the concatenation of all sentence embedding differences, instead of summing them up. From N-best hypotheses, we can collect $N\\cdot(N-1)/2$ sentence-level embedding differences from each pair of hypotheses in the N-best list (i.e., $1 + 2 + \\cdots + (N-1) = N\\cdot(N-1)/2$), where each of them has tensor shape $ \\mathbb{R}^{1\\times D_\\text{sbert}}$. Samely, we can also obtain $N\\cdot(N-1)/2$ token-level embedding differences. Therefore, we concatenate all of these $N\\cdot(N-1)$ embedding differences along the first dimension to get a language-space noise embedding $E_\\text{LN} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\cdot(N-1)\\times D_\\text{sbert}}$.\n\n  We have made these clear in the updated manuscript.\n\n- ***Q3: In figure 2, and eq (3), why the language-space noise embedding is \u2018subtracted\u2019 from the prompt? I found another related equation in eq (13) of the Appendix and the authors only mention \u201cthe subtraction operation denotes \u201cdenoise\u201d\u201d, more explanation is needed.***\n\n  Thanks for pointing out this, and we apologize for making you confused. After calculating language-space noise embedding $E_\\text{LN}$, we add a minus sign before it to build a **denoise** embedding, which is then sent into LLM to teach it to perform language-space denoising (i.e., **reduce** the noise from LLM finetuning). This is an intuitive design to implement the idea of language-space **denoising**. We have made this clear in Section 4.1 and modified the \u201csubtract\u201d in Fig.2 to \u201cdenoise\u201d.\n\n- ***Q4: In eq(8), $I_\\Theta(X; Y)$ should be $I_\\Theta(X; Z)$.***\n\n  Thanks for pointing out this, we have corrected it in the updated manuscript."

If we remove the minus sign, the proposed approach still outperforms the baselines but are worse than our current result with this minus sign. We speculate the reason could be, the LLaMA-Adapter itself can learn this minus sign to \"denoise\" instead of \"add noise\" during finetuning, but if we explicitly define the minus sign, it might be easier for LLaMA-Adapter to conduct denoising.\n\nThank you again for bringing up this question, we believe it could become a promising interpretability topic for future work."

But perhaps I am wrong on this so correct me if so.***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. We respectfully hold the view that ASR error correction should be a good fit to ICLR conference because:\n\n  1) Speech and ASR has been a subject area of ICLR conference [1-4], ASR error correction is also popular in similar machine learning and AI conferences recently [5-8] (including our baseline \u2013 Generative Error Correction in [5]). This shows that ASR error correction has started to become popular in the machine learning community, especially with the latest advances of LLMs.\n  2) Our ASR error correction work follows the latest research trend of adapting LLMs to various downstream tasks [9-11]. We first propose some general findings about LLMs in multimodal tasks: language embedding outperforms audio embedding in prompting LLM adaptation. Then, we propose a novel representation learning method to extract such language embedding to benefit LLM adaptation, and our experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. Therefore, our approach could be potentially applied to other multimodal tasks with LLMs in future work. We believe such contributions are also a good fit to ICLR conference.\n  3) ASR error correction itself can be viewed as a seq2seq representation learning task [5-8]: the ASR-recognized text is sent into an encoder-decoder (e.g., Transformer) or decoder-only (e.g., LLaMA) architecture to generate a corrected text as output, where the key is to learn the contextual semantics of input text, i.e., text representation learning.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Chang, Oscar, Dongseong Hwang, and Olivier Siohan. \"Revisiting the Entropy Semiring for Neural Speech Recognition.\" ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] Ren, Yi, Chen Zhang, and Y.

In our experiments, we use 1 NVIDIA A40 GPU (48GB) for model training, which takes 1.5 hours for CHiME-4 dataset, 2.0 hours for VB-DEMAND, 1.6 hours for NOIZEUS, 4.5 hours for LS-FreeSound, and 3.8 hours for RATS, respectively. Actually we have introduced them in Appendix C.2 (first paragraph).\n\n- ***Q3: The description of building the embedding space is somehow confusing in particular terms. For example, in Section 4.2.1 - what is \"diversity similar to variance\"?***\n\n  We apologize for making you confused, we have removed this term to avoid ambiguity. Eq. (4) concatenates the embedding difference between each two hypotheses in the N-best list, which measures the diversity within the N-best hypotheses.\n\n- ***Q4: Section 5.4 - What is Table 14?***\n\n  We apologize for making you confused. Table 14 indicates the ablation study of the audio distillation approach in terms of different KD techniques (i.e. teacher-student learning, contrastive learning, and our utilized MINE), where the analysis is provided in Appendix D.4. We mention it in Section 5.4 to highlight the effectiveness of proposed audio distillation approach.\n\n- ***Q5: I suggest to put the definition of embedding a bit earlier from the beginning of Section 4. Otherwise, Figure 2 looks a bit confusing.***\n\n  Thanks for your suggestion, and we apologize for making you confused. We would like to address your concerns from two aspects:\n\n  1) Actually we had tried to put the definition of embeddings in Eq. (4)-(6) at the beginning of Section 4, but that would break its logic of presentation. Because we have to first introduce the overall framework of RobustGER (Section 4.1) and then go into the specific embedding extraction (Section 4.2) and distillation approach (Section 4.3).\n  2) Fig.2 aims to depict the overall framework (left part) and the embedding extraction (right part), where the right part just simply sketches the embedding extraction approach, instead of detailed description due to space limit. For better clarity, we have added some explanations in Fig. 2\u2019s caption to help readers understand it, as well as a hyperlink to help them find the specific definitions in Eq. (4)-(6).\n\n  We hope this makes sense, and we are also willing to discuss more if you have any further suggestions.\n\n- ***Q6: I wonder the motivation of using Robust Hyporadise dataset for noisy ASR condition. What kind of noise it exactly contains? Is it replacible with other noisy datasets that are more commonly known to the ASR community, such as Switchboard and VoxCeleb (just two examples, they may not be good fit)?***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. Our Robust HyPoradise dataset covers many common noisy ASR scenarios in real world, in order to evaluate the generality of our proposed approach. The details of their noise conditions are introduced in Appendix A.2, which include:\n  1) **CHiME-4:** bus, cafe, pedestrian area, street junction;\n  2) **VB-DEMAND:** training data contains 10 noise types (babble, cafeteria, car, kitchen, meeting, metro, restaurant, speech-shaped noise, station, traffic), test data contains 3 new noise types (baby-cry, helicopter, and crowd-party) \u2013 simulate an unseen noise testing condition that is common in real-world scenarios;\n  3) **NOIZEUS:** 8 noise types from Aurora-2 database (suburban train noise, babble, car, exhibition hall, restaurant, street, airport and train-station noise);\n  4) **LibriSpeech-FreeSound:** 6 noise types from FreeSound database (metro, car, traffic, cafe, babble and ac/vacuum);\n  5) **RATS:** radio communication speech in ultra high frequency data category that is extremely noisy and challenging for ASR.\n\n  Yes, our RobustGER can be extended to any noisy ASR datasets, and we are exactly planning to make such extensions for future work, which would then be open sourced to benefit the community. \n\n  The two datasets you mentioned are both good fit for Robust Hyporadise, we did not select them before due to their less diverse noise categories than our utilized five datasets. We will add them for future extensions, thanks again for your suggestion."

I mentioned Switchboard in the last question, which is an 8KHz dataset.***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. We think our model is not sensitive to sampling frequency. The whole pipeline of our system consists of two stages: \n  1) use Whisper for ASR decoding to generate N-best hypotheses; \n  2) employ LLM-based RobustGER to generate ground-truth transcription from N-best hypotheses. \n\n  The sampling frequency of source speech is directly related to stage 1), where Whisper is a general ASR model that can handle input speech of different sampling rates.\n\n  We also list the sampling rates of our selected ASR datasets here for your reference: \n  1) **CHiME-4:** 16 kHz; \n  2) **VB-DEMAND:** 48 kHz; \n  3) **NOIZEUS:** 8 kHz; \n  4) **LibriSpeech-FreeSound:** 16 kHz; \n  5) **RATS:** 8 kHz. \n\n  Our approach has achieved improvements on all of them.\n\n- ***Q8: In section 4.2.2, why you think MINE can enhance the noise representation ability? It looks like MINE is not part of novelty here, so any work backing it up.***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. MINE stands for \u201cmutual information neural estimation\u201d [12], which employs neural network to estimate mutual information. In this work, we leverage MINE to enhance the noise representation ability of proposed language embedding in two stages: \n  1) MINE is trained to learn accurate MI estimation; \n  2) We freeze the weights of MINE and maximize the estimated MI between our proposed language embedding and the noisy audio embedding, where we insert a tuner to make the language embedding trainable (see Fig. 3). As a result, our language embedding would be tuned to contain more information of audio noise. \n\n  This design is also similar to GAN that employs discriminator to supervise the generator. More details are presented in Appendix B.2.\n\n  Yes, MINE is followed from previous work [12], where the citation is put at two lines before Eq. (8).\n\n**Reference**\n\n[12] Mohamed Ishmael Belghazi, Aristide Baratin, Sai Rajeshwar, Sherjil Ozair, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, and Devon Hjelm. Mutual information neural estimation.

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate Reviewer ZWfm for considering our work is novel and solid with a noise-robust focus. Your suggestions are with decent insights for us to revise parts of the submission draft. Please find the responses below:\n\n- ***Q1: The illustrations of (b) GER with audio-space denoising (Zhang et al., 2023b; Fathullah et al., 2023) and (c) GER with language-space denoising (ours) are a little challenging to follow. Is denoised audio directly fed to the LLM adapter, or is there something else you want to express?***\n\n  Thanks for pointing out this, and we apologize for making you confused.\n  \n  Here are detailed explanations of system (b) and (c):\n\n  **(b) GER with audio-space denoising:** Yes, the denoised audio embedding is directly fed into llama-adapter (Zhang et al., 2023b) to guide the LLM denoising process, you may turn to Fig.5 and Section B.1.2 in Appendix for details.\n\n  **(c) GER with language-space denoising:** Same pipeline as system (b) but we replace the audio embedding with our proposed language embedding. First we extract the language-space noise embedding from N-best list, and then employ KD to distill the real audio noise information to our extracted embedding, finally it is fed into the llama-adapter for language-space denoising.\n\n  **About the two citations here:**  Zhang et al., (2023b) proposes the llama-adapter and visual prompting strategy; Fathullah et al., (2023) leverages audio signal to prompt LLM. The baseline (b) is inspired by both of them.\n\n  We have modified Fig. 1 to make it more clear, and we added a hyperlink in Fig. 1\u2019s caption to help readers find the details in Appendix (due to space limit we may not add more explanations there). We are willing to discuss more if you have any further suggestions. \n\n- ***Q2: We noticed that the HP database only comes from the n-best of a few models. Is it possible to introduce more diverse system outputs from various models?***\n\n  Thanks for your comment. Yes, both the existing work of HP and our proposed RobustHP database can be created using any pre-trained ASR models that support beam search decoding. Actually, we also plan to extend more diverse N-best hypotheses from various ASR models (e.g., WavLM, Wav2vec2, Conformer-Transducer) for future work, which would then be open sourced to benefit the community.\n\n- ***Q3: Cramped space allocated to Section 4.3.***\n\n  Thanks for pointing out this, and we have added some details in Section 4.3 to make it more readable.\n\n  Here we would like to explain our considerations for the organization of methodology section: \n\n  1) Actually we think Section 4.2 should be the core contribution of this paper, which proposes the language-space noise embedding for LLM denoising. More importantly, this part is the most original in the whole paper.\n  2) We agree with you that Section 4.3 (audio noise distillation) is an important part of this paper, but after all, it is built based on previous work MINE [1] and aims to enhance the noise representativeness of extracted language embedding in Section 4.2.\n\n  Based on above two considerations, we prefer to assign more space (1 page) to Section 4.2 to highlight the main contribution of this work. For Section 4.3, we have made the most effort to clearly present it in the main content (also nearly 1 page\u2019s space) and put more details in Appendix B.2. We hope this makes sense, and we are also willing to discuss more if you have any further suggestions.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Mohamed Ishmael Belghazi, Aristide Baratin, Sai Rajeshwar, Sherjil Ozair, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville, and Devon Hjelm.

It is interesting that this method avoids the difficulty of cross-modal fine-tuning by doing so. It is also compelling because it seems that humans actually perform similar processing in noisy environments.\n\nQuality:\nThe paper is rich in evaluation, and the improvement interval is significant compared with the existing baselines. Also, it provides theoretical hypotheses why the proposed method works better that sound convincing.\n\nClarity:\nThe description appears complete. I have not read all the details, but I get the impression that this paper is very well organized.\n\nSignificance:\nThe task addressed is clearly significant because it has many practical applications. The novel approach presented in this paper is also be interesting, and I think it can potentially be applied in other modalities."
