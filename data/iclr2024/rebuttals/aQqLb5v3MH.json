To remedy this, two sparse training techniques, mask and structure decay gradient flow (MDGF and SDGF) are proposed, which gradually decay the magnitude of sparsity masks. These successfully reduce gradient variance. Experiments are conducted on ViT, Swin, and ResNet models on ImageNet, T5 on GLUE, and an encoder/decoder transformer on English-German translation, and show MDGF or SDGF a SR-STE baseline."

                    "value": "1. The paper's clarity could be improved. I found it hard to follow and the methods proposed to be incompletely specified. Improved figures and a full algorithm specification could be helpful here. At a higher level, the paper's structure is odd: It first proposes new methods (MDGF/SDGF) and then shows they introduce different training dynamics (reducing gradient variance). To me it seems this should be reversed: First identify the problem with existing methods (too much gradient variance), then develop a method that solves this problem. This argument could be strengthened by showing what the variance of SR-STE is relative to training without any pruning.\n2. The experiments do not include any measure of variance across training runs. Given the stochasticity of training and pruning, this is critical to determining how well the methods perform relative to each other, especially given that the differences in performance are relatively small.\n3. It is not clear to me how relevant the discussion of training performance in Section 5.1 is. While sparsity will indeed reduce parameter (and hence gradient and optimizer state) counts and can reduce the number of flops, I do not think this translates so directly to improved performance: Data movement overheads are often paramount and not necessarily linear in the number of parameters; further, there are practical overheads (e.g., data marshalling to actually run the n:m format) which complicate this. A more nuanced discussion would serve better.\n4. Related to (3), I am confused about what exactly Table 4 is showing. The caption indicates \"training recipe performance\", as does the paragraph heading (\"Training performance\"), yet the paragraph refers to \"_inference_ cost measured in FLOPs\" (emphasis added)."

The discussion in Section 4 would also benefit from more precisely defining the metrics being shown and the study done.\n2. In Section 4, what is the gradient variance for training a model with no pruning?\n3. Please add variance to the accuracy results in Section 5. If this is done and continues to show the trends indicated, I am willing to raise my score.\n4. Please clarify the discussion of training performance in Section 5.1 (see above)."
