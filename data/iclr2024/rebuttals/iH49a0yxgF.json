Some parts of the methods need more clarification or justification. For example, what are the encoders? Why is the Domain Shift Uncertainty (DSU) layer necessary?\n\nOur answer: The encoders correspond to the original algorithms developed for a given task and published in [1,2,3]. Each encoder is briefly described in the supplementary section \u201cB.1 experiments and background\u201d because of the page limit for the core paper. The following sentence in the manuscript has been edited accordingly:\n\n\u201cMore details on the task, its clinical importance, the DL encoder used and the datasets for each experiment are provided in the supplement B1.\u201d\n\n[1] Levy, Jeremy, et al. Nature Communications 14.1 (2023): 4881.\n[2] Kotzen, Kevin, et al. IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics 27.2 (2022): 924-932.\n[3] Ben-Moshe, et al. 2022 Computing in Cardiology (CinC). Vol. 498. IEEE, 2022.\n\nThe motivation for including a DSU layer is elaborated upon in question 4.\n\n2. Technical contribution is limited. The model extends existing NNCLR algorithm by incorporating more nearest neighbors in the support set.\n\nOur answer: In this paper, we focus on the scarcely explored, yet critically important area of UDA applied to continuous physiological time series. These time series form the backbone of daily clinical practice, playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. As researchers in this area we are confronted with a persistent, unresolved challenge in developing DL support tools for continuous physiological time series analysis: namely the effective deployment of our algorithms in real-world settings where the distribution of the data differs from the source domain. Our findings strongly support the importance of UDA in analyzing continuous physiological time series. Thus, our contribution not only enhances the algorithmic performance of NNCLR but also provides strong evidence on the potential of using UDA to bridge a crucial gap in medicine, potentially transforming patient care through more precise and adaptable diagnostic tools.\n\n3. Citation format is wrong, which reduces readability of the paper.\n\nOur answer: We thank the reviewer for his/her remark and have now fixed the citations style.\n\n4. What are the encoders for each task? Why is the Domain Shift Uncertainty (DSU) layer necessary? Please clarify in Methods.\n\nOur answer: We experimented with and without the DSU layer, and found that it was improving the performance based on the validation set. We thus decided to include it as one of the components of our framework. The ablation study presented in Figure 3 clearly shows that the DSU layer has a contribution to the overall DUDE performance. The DSU layer introduces some \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the encoder. The introduction of uncertainty makes the model less prone to overfitting on the source domain by reducing its excessive confidence, thereby facilitating domain adaptation.\n\n5. It would be interesting to see how model performance varies across lambda (i.e., number of neighbors), e.g., does model performance saturate or degrade with larger number of neighbors?\n\nOur answer: We have explored this question for Experiment 1 and have added Table S3 where the results are reported. We ran simulations for 1, 2, 5 and 10 neighbors. The results indeed show that performance tends to increase while increasing the number from 1 to 5. However, it then decreases for 10 neighbors, i.e. performance degrades with too large a number of neighbors.\n\n6. In ablation study (Figure S1), what\u2019s the setup for DSU and NNCLR\u0394? Please clarify.\n\nOur answer: The ablation study is now reported in the core manuscript as Figure 3. The experimental setup used is the exact same as for the main experiments conducted in the manuscript. To clarify that, we have updated the caption of Figure 3 to:\n\n\u201cAblation study on the main components of DUDE. The training of the Baseline and DSU models include the source domain training patients. The training of the NNCLR_Delta and DUDE model includes the exact same set of patients from the source domain as well as a subset of each target domain patients (as unlabeled samples). See \"Experimental settings\" in section 4.2.\u201d\n\n7. Hidden in the supplement, the authors discuss that including a supervised loss prevents latent space collapse. Please provide an ablation study to support this claim.\n\nOur answer: A new simulation for Experiment 1 was added to Table S2. The lack of supervised loss led to very poor model performance on all target domains. Indeed, without supervised loss, there is the issue of space collapse due to the numerous positive instances in contrastive learning. This underscores the importance of employing a supervised loss in our analysis. We added to section B.3 the reference to Table S3:"

What if one selects source samples randomly instead of nearest neighbors? How many samples are really needed from the source domain to be effective for adaptation?\n\nOur answer: We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now added a simulation for experiment 1 per which source samples are selected randomly. This experimental result is reported in Table S2 under \u201cRandom selection of neighbor\u201d. We run the simulation for 1, 2, 5 and 10 neighbors. We also recall in Table S2 the performance of DUDE for comparison. We found that DUDE's performance was significantly and non-incrementally better to the approach of randomly selecting neighbors for all target domains. This result underscores the importance of employing a nearest neighbors approach in our analysis.\n\nRegarding the number of samples that are necessary from the source domain to enable an effective adaptation, we show in Table S3 how the number of nearest neighbors affects the performance for experiment#1. In addition, instead of working with a constant number of neighbors we have shown that there is value in using a variable number of nearest neighbors. Using NNCLR_Delta the nearest neighbors are selected on the basis of a cosine distance instead of selecting a constant number. We have shown that this dynamical approach outperforms working with a fixed number of nearest neighbors (Figure 2).\n\n2. During adaptation, how important it is to also use a supervised loss? Ablation is very important, but it is missing.\n\nOur answer: We acknowledge the importance of an ablation study and agree that it should have been part of the main manuscript rather than the supplementary material. Accordingly, we have now included the ablation study in the main manuscript, as illustrated in Figure 3. This study highlights the added value of each critical component within the DUDE framework. Specifically, it shows the value of the NNCLR approach for the contrastive loss, the capability to vary the number of neighbors with NNCLR_Delta, and the incorporation of DSU layers into the architecture. The results show that for all experiments, the DUDE framework equals or outperforms the other benchmarks, meaning that each component has an added value.\n\nAccordingly the following sentences were added to the discussion section:\n\n\u201cThe ablation study (Figure 3) was performed to assess the value added by each component of DUDE. It highlights the added value of each of these components. The results show that for all experiments, the DUDE framework equals or outperforms the other benchmarks, meaning that each component has an added value.\u201d\n\nRegarding the importance of using a supervised loss. A new simulation for exp. 1 was added to Table S2. The lack of supervised loss led to very poor model performance on all target domains.

This underscores the importance of employing a supervised loss in our analysis.

Are the baseline results (in Table 1-4) are from corresponding papers, or are the methods reimplemented and ran by the authors?\n\nOur answer: The encoder models from [1,2,3] and presented in Table 1-4 were obtained from the original authors. That is the exact same source code used in the original publications [1,2,3] were used for our experiments. We have added a sentence clarifying that:\n\n\u201cThe original source code for these three models were used.\u201d\n\n[1] Levy, Jeremy, et al.

This observation is coherent with the intuition that leveraging the strength of incorporating a few \"close\" neighbors can enhance the learning process while avoiding the potential drawback of introducing too many neighbors, which could lead to increased distance from the original example.\n\n5.

It is however important to emphasize that in a healthcare diagnostic context, even a small improvement in a model\u2019s performance can have significant implications. This enhancement can lead to more accurate and timely diagnosis, potentially saving lives by identifying diseases earlier or more accurately. In a field where precision is paramount, such improvements can significantly impact patient outcomes.\n\n2.

The paper claims that the best hyperparameter \u0394 found on the validation set was 0.95 for both experiments and thus shows the consistency for different experimental settings, which is not convincing. The authors may need to conduct a more comprehensive sensitivity analyses on this hyper-parameter or propose a valid hyper-parameter selection guideline for new tasks or unseen datasets.\n\n2.\tThe paper highlights that DUDE is proposed for physiological time series analyses, but from the technical view, the framework can be used for general time series UDA problems.

Our answer: In this paper, we focus on the scarcely explored, yet critically important area of UDA applied to continuous physiological time series. These time series form the backbone of daily clinical practice, playing a pivotal role in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. As researchers in this area we are confronted with a persistent, unresolved challenge in developing translational DL support tools for continuous physiological time series analysis, namely the effective deployment of our algorithms in real-world settings where the distribution of the data differs from the source domain. Our findings strongly support the importance of UDA in analyzing continuous physiological time series. Thus, our contribution not only enhances the algorithmic performance of NNCLR but also provides strong evidence on the potential of using UDA to bridge a crucial gap in real-world applications of deep learning, potentially transforming patient care through more precise and adaptable diagnostic tools.\n\nWith respect to the choice of the delta hyperparameter, we have further elaborated the methods section describing the hyper-parameter approach we used:\n\n\u201cThe evaluation was conducted on the validation set, which consists of labeled samples exclusively from the source domain. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using a Bayesian search with 100 iterations, meaning training the model on the train set, and validating it against the validation set. The results on the source and target domains test sets are presented for the best hyperparameter configuration found.\u201d\n\nIn that respect we confirm that there is no information leakage in the training process of DUDE as all hyperparameters, including \u0394, are learned through a search performed over the validation set.\n\n2. Our answer: The reviewer is correct in stating that DUDE could be applied to a broad range of time series UDA problems. Given the clinical significance of continuous physiological time series and the existing gap in research on utilizing UDA for their analysis, we chose to concentrate our efforts in this area. However, we have now included a sentence in the discussion to acknowledge that the DUDE framework could indeed be valuable for analyzing other types of time series.\n\n3. Our answer: The reviewer is correct in noting that a number of additional benchmarks could be included. Unlike other subfields of DL where SOTA approaches are well-defined, this is not the case in the field of UDA. Therefore, we have identified and included one important benchmark for each mainstream UDA approach. We then focused on demonstrating the added value of NNCLR_Delta versus NNCLR within the DUDE framework. However, we agree that expanding this research to include more UDA benchmarks is desirable. We have therefore included the following statement in the discussion section:\n\n\u201cFuture work should include benchmarking DUDE against additional UDA approaches such as those of Cai et al.(2021); Tonekaboni et al. (2021); Ragab et al. (2022); Eldele et al. (2023).\u201d\n\n4. Our answer: AdaIN (ref3) aligns the mean and variance of the feature from one domain to another, for the purpose of style transfer. In DSU, a non-Bayesian approach has been taken, and the goal is to insert uncertainty into the model. \n\n5. Our answer: Specific data augmentation techniques are particularly effective for certain physiological time series, owing to the unique characteristics of the data, such as cyclic patterns and types of noise. The specific augmentation techniques chosen for each task were informed by previous experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of certain techniques for specific time series and tasks, such as the random switch for SpO2 (Levy et al 2022). This choice was also guided by discrete experiments with common data augmentation techniques (Saeed et al. 2019) and their performance evaluation on the validation set thus preventing any information leakage. The careful selection of these augmentations is crucial, as an even more strategic choice could potentially enhance DUDE's performance further and a comprehensive study benchmarking the effects of a subset of classic augmentation techniques would be beneficial. A paragraph has been added to the discussion accordingly.\n\n6. Our answer: We acknowledge the importance of an ablation study and agree that it should have been part of the main manuscript rather than the supplementary material. Accordingly, we have now included the ablation study in the main manuscript - Figure 3. This study highlights the added value of each critical component within the DUDE framework. Specifically, it shows the value of the NNCLR approach for the contrastive loss, the capability to vary the number of neighbors with NNCLR_Delta, and the incorporation of DSU layers into the architecture."
