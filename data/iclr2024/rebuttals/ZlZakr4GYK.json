The paper also introduced the technical background of TPPs and also the proposed convolution operation in details. \n\nClarity: the paper is easy to follow from paragraph to paragraph. \n\nSignificance: it can be somewhat significant to the TPP community as typical approaches are via neural models for sequences such as RNN and transformer.

What is the kernel $\\kappa()$, how is this continuous convolution related to the well-known CNN? Does the proposed model scalable?\n\n3. More experimental details should be specified, such as the MIMIC data has 65 event types, only 285 sequences with average length at 8.6. Then, how is the deep learning model trained?

                    "value": "First of all, the proposed model has several technical defects in terms of modeling events from temporal point processes:\n\n1. An essential nature of point processes is the stochasticity of future event generation, which means that even with a given history, the occurrences of future events are still stochastic. However, despite the good predictive performance of the proposed model, it only provides deterministic predictions of the next event given history (or to say, the embedding), which leads to a significant model loss when it comes to modeling asynchronous events. \n2. The conditional intensity function $\\lambda$ of the point process enables such stochastic modeling of future events. However, even though the paper proposes a way to model the $\\lambda$, there exists a significant problem. According to equation 7, the evaluation of $\\lambda$ at any event time $t_k$ will take the $k$-th event into account. However, according to the nature of point processes [1], the $k$-th event is excluded when evaluating $\\lambda(t_k)$. Such a self-inclusion has the severe problem of causality. Also, learning $\\lambda$ with self-inclusion based on negative log-likelihood will lead to singular results (extremely large values at event times and small values at non-event times). I expect the authors to have some simulations to prove that their conditional intensity function can accurately recover the ground truth (like the $\\lambda$ in the classic Hawkes process with exponentially decaying kernel).\n\nOther weaknesses also exist:\n\n3. No simulation or experiments on synthetic datasets, which makes me suspect whether the model can really recover the ground truth.\n4. No results of the comparison of negative log-likelihood on testing sets, which is a classic metric in evaluating the goodness of point process modeling.\n4. The notation on page 4 is confusing. If I understand right, $j$ should be the index of events which is an integer, but $T_i$ is the upper limit of the time horizon which is a real number. How $j$ takes the value of $T_i$? And $k > j,  t_{ik} \u2265 t_{jk}$ is also confusing.\n\n---\n[1] Alan G Hawkes. Spectra of some self-exciting and mutually exciting point processes. Biometrika, 58(1):83\u201390, 1971."
