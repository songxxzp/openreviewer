Does this suggest that the proposed selection of appropriate curriculum is not better than manual design (progressively increases the block size)?\n3) In Table 2, Mixed has a worse performance than Random. Does this mean that block-wise masking is not conducive to long-term planning?"

On zero-shot skill prompting and goal-conditioned planning, it shows CurrMask is better than random masking and progressive block masking. On offline RL, it shows CurrMask can achieve higher cumulative rewards though sometimes falling behind in the middle of training.\n\nThe ablations on different mask block sizes and ratios show the model prefers larger blocks while maintaining a medium mask ratio as training progresses."

Without explaining these, it is hard for me to understand how the proposed approach learn the masking curriculum.\n\n2. There is no visualization of the proposed masking curriculums. As this is the central contribution of the paper, it would be very interesting to see what the actual masking curriculum is for those continuous control tasks and how is affect the numerical results. \n\n3. From table 1 and table 2, it seems the proposed approach CurrMask is only slightly better the baseline masking schemes in a few scenarios (<50%).\n\n4.
