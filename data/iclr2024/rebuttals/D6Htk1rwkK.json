                    "value": "1) The paper is difficult to follow. In some places, there are many methodological details presented, but the experiment hypothesis and conclusions need to be better described. In general, the writing could be clearer and more precise. \n2) Many of the experiments seem preliminary, which makes it hard to draw conclusions. For instance, the authors state in the discussion \u201cwe could not reproduce Nassar et. al. (2020)\u2019s results, probably due to the differences in our modeling choices\u201d, and in the appendix \u201cmost of our results suggest that we might have made sub-optimal choices in our methods regarding competitive results with spectral regularizers\u201d. While I appreciate the authors being honest about these limitations, this leaves more questions than answers. What would change if models were made that *did* reproduce these previous results? Is there something fundamentally non-reproducible about the previous work? This makes the presented results difficult to interpret, and in the words of the authors \u201cwe ought to be cautious with generalizing them beyond the scope of this work\u201d. \n3) There was not enough relation to previous literature. For instance, the authors motivate adversarial robustness with an example from cancer diagnosis, but there are many papers in the NeuroAI world that have directly looked at the robustness of models compared to human observers. This seems like it would be more relevant to the neuroscience audience that this paper is targeted towards. I encourage the authors to look at this work (some places to start would be Geirhos et al. 2018, Geirhos et al. 2021, Guo et al 2022, Harrington et al. 2022, Feather et al. 2023 but there are many many more). \n4) Minor: The citation format in the text seems to be incorrect with missing \u201c()\u201d around the text citations.\n5) Minor: In the first two sentences of section 3.2 the authors state that Figure 3 shows the spectrum of the KH layer, but this is not in Figure 3 (although it is in Figure 2)."

In Stringer et al. I believe that the first few and last few eigenvalues are ignored. How does that play into the fitting here? \n\nc) Which points (scales) are used for fitting the alpha value in Figure 2? Additionally, the different colored dots are not defined in the plot. A legend should be included. \n\nd) It would be helpful to show the non-normalized robustness plots. Because the clean performance significantly differs these are hard to interpret as shown. \n\ne) Figure 4 is interesting, however the statements about \u201csmoother\u201d decision landscapes should be quantified if one is to directly compare the results to the adversarial robustness curves."

The descriptions of the analyses and results are messy. \n\n- Various statements are not rigorous. For example, the paper stated, \u201cbiological neurons adjust connectivity based on neighboring cell activity\u201d. What is the evidence for this? Also, the brain has abundant long-range connections.\n\n- The paper is motivated by Stringer et al (Nature, 2019). However, the interpretation of their results seems to be somewhat misleading. The paper stated \u201cThey prove that this smoothness is linked to the functional form of a power law decay in the manifold\u2019s covariance spectrum. In particular, balancing accuracy and robustness, a sweet spot lies close to a 1/n power law, with n denoting the index of the ordered spectral component. \u201d But I don\u2019t think Stringer et al 2019 proved a connection between the 1/n spectrum with the robustness. It was a conjecture described in the last paragraph of that paper. Also, Stringer et al predict different power-law relationships depending on the properties of the stimulus set (e.g., natural scene v.s. gratings). It is unclear whether the current results are consistent with theirs."

The 1/n spectrum, the geometry of represntation and decision boundary and adversarial robustness are all interesting, but currently they have not connect to form an overall story. It will be better to form a few central claims and then back it up with experiments and data.\n- The writing and overall organization of the paper could be improved\u2026\n    - In the method section, it will benefit from a more streamlined organization. Currently it\u2019s jumping between method, results and some interpretations\u2026. Some paragraph (Figure 1 and its interpretation) should go to the results section. Adding headings e.g. paragraph titles can also help. e.g. model architecture, unsupervised training, supervised training, spectral analysis etc.\n    - Similarly in the result section, better headings for the experiments could be added to guide the readers.\n- Generally the paper\u2019s experiment is relatively small scale, majorly with 2 layer MLPs. The generalization to deeper networks or CNNs is desirable for bigger impact.\n- For the decision boundary and  analysis, it may be worthwhile to refer to some previous works.\n    - For example, the Frob norm of jacobian plot vs the decision boundary is interesting, and [1] devotes the whole paper to understand this. The technical difference is they plotted the volume element, which is the sum of log eigenvalues, instead of sum of squared eigenvalues in your case.\n    - Though outside image classification, for GAN networks, [2] analyzed the homogeneity / flatness of the Jacobian eigenframe across the space. which maybe useful for quantification in your case.\n\n[1]: ****Neural networks learn to magnify areas near decision boundaries****  https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11375 \n\n[2]: ****The Geometry of Deep Generative Image Models and its Applications**** https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06006  \n\n### Minor Weakness and typos\n\n- \u201c*Because principal components correspond to the eigenvectors of the respective*\n*covariance matrix Cov(h,h)*\u201d should it be $\\hat{h},\\hat{h}$ ?\n- In Figure 2 and Figure 3, what does different color shades mean? is it different runs of the model?\n- The notation in Eq. 9 in appendix is not clear, $D$ seems to mean differential operator, but it\u2019s not standard and not defined anywhere, using partial differential or more standard notation may be easier for reader.\n- Eq. 10 in appendix is also confusing or even wrong. $\\sigma\u2019(Wx)$ seems to be a vector, how do you take the absolute value and time it with the L2 norm of $W$? Are you using some special properties of $\\sigma$?\n- What is *SHLP?*"
