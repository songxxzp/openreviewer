                    "value": "- The primary concern in this paper revolves around the significance of predicting the representation in the critic. The representations in the critic undergo drastic changes, exhibit high levels of instability, and lack interpretability. The author provides intuitive reasons for its effectiveness but lacks theoretical support and experimental analysis. Furthermore, due to the complexity of the algorithm architecture, including the use of GRU, attention mechanisms, and complex AC network structure, analyzing why this method is effective becomes more challenging.\n- There are many approaches to addressing the issue of partial observability, such as predicting the global state from local observations. However, this paper lacks a thorough investigation into such methods, and there is no discussion of related work in this regard. \n- The experimental evaluation in this paper is relatively weak. Firstly, the algorithm does not appear to converge. For instance,  fine-tuned QMIX can already achieve a 100% win rate on almost all SMAC tasks by itself. Can APC achieve better performance after sufficient training? Additionally, the experiments on MA MuJoCo only cover two tasks, and the performance of on-policy baselines in such tasks is not effective. The author should consider comparing with off-policy MARL algorithms. In addition, this paper is not compared to related works addressing the same issue. Certainly, this depends on a thorough investigation of related works, which is also a crucial aspect lacking in this paper.\n- Finally, in the appendix, the authors argue that predicting other agents' behaviors in the CTDE framework is not meaningful. I disagree with this viewpoint. Since the learning process in MARL is dynamic and the optimization direction is aligned, guided learning through policy gradients leads the agent's behavior to converge to suboptimal states. At this point, being able to make accurate estimates of other agents' behavior is likely to have a positive impact on the learning process."

                    "value": "- Why do we need to the loss p? Directly sharing the critic's input with the actor might be a more straightforward approach.\n- Intuitively, it seems that the proposed predictive loss in this paper should not rely on such complex architectural designs. Only through a comparison under identical architectures can it be demonstrated whether the proposed loss in this paper is truly effective. Would there be a performance gain when comparing under the same structure?\n- Could the authors provide a performance comparison on different tasks using the same network architecture as the baseline?"

We use ***Q***, ***W***, ***A*** to denote question, weakness, and answer.\n\n>***Q1***\n\n***A1***: Sharing the global information provided by the critic directly with the actor would break the CTDE framework. This will make the algorithm centralized and require global information as input during the execution phase, which is not allowed in many application scenarios. (This point has been mentioned in the Introduction section.)\n\n>***Q2*** & ***W1***\n\n***A2***: In fact, our network structure is not as complicated as you described. The structure of the critic network is also used by MAT (MAT-Dec as well). In the actor network, we only added a GRU module for learning global representation compared to MAT-Dec.\n\n>***Q3***\n\n***A3***: As ***A2*** has mentioned, our network is essentially based on MAT-Dec with the addition of a representation prediction module based on GRU. And the experimental results do show significant improvement compared to MAT-Dec which proves the effectiveness of APC. However, we still appreciate the reviewer\u2019s suggestion and will further try to add the representation prediction module to MAPPO and observe the experimental results.\n\n>***W2***\n\n***A4***: We have already introduced some relevant methods about predicting additional information in the Introduction section. However, most of the algorithms we have researched have no open-source code or have not been tested on the SMAC environment. Reproducing these algorithms and finding the best parameters for these algorithms in the SMAC environment requires a lot of time and effort. Therefore, we did not include these methods in the comparison. We will investigate more methods and conduct experiments to compare them with APC in future work.\n\n>***W4***\n\n***A5***: As HAPPO[1] has already pointed out, if the agents make synchronous decisions and there is no sequential dependency between their actions, it might not lead to the optimal result.\n\n[1] Jakub Grudzien Kuba, Ruiqing Chen, Muning Wen, Ying Wen, Fanglei Sun, Jun Wang, and Yaodong Yang.

We use ***Q***, ***W***, ***A*** to denote question, weakness, and answer.\n\n>***Q1***\n\n***A1***: Here are the parameter numbers (on the 6h vs 8z map) of APC and the compared baselines:\n\n| APC | MAT-Dec | MAPPO | QMIX |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 116513 | 60361 | 72553 | 73871 |\n\nMost of the additional parameters of APC come from the prediction module in the actor, which is mainly based on GRU.\n\n>***Q2***\n\n***A2***: We believe that the difference in fine-tuned QMIX\u2019s performance comes from two aspects: random seed settings and measurement methods. Since the fine-tuned QMIX does not provide detailed seed settings, we use our own generated random seeds, which may lead to differences between the results. Additionally, the evaluation metric used by fine-tuned QMIX is the best median win rate. In our paper, we use the average win rates of each method in the last 5 evaluation rounds over 10 random seeds.\n\n>***Q3***\n\n***A3***: Due to time constraints, we only conducted ablation experiments about the number of layers on the 6h vs 8z map in SMAC, and the results are as follows:\n\n| APC with mlp1 | APC with mlp3 | APC with mlp5 |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 66.7(3.3) | 81.8(7.1) | 72.3(3.6) |\n\nWe changed the number of layers in the MLP of the actor (with 1, 3, and 5 layers). It can be seen that as the number of layers in the network increased from 1 to 3, the winning rate increased significantly. However, when the number of layers increased to 5, the network\u2019s performance slightly decreased, which is consistent with the point mentioned in this paper that information transmission and gradient updates become more difficult as the number of layers in the network increases. We believe that the ablation experiments in the article are sufficient to attribute the performance of APC to global representation prediction rather than changes in network layers or tricks like residual connections.\n\n>***Q4***\n\n***A4***: We tested both the Euclidean distance and the MSE loss function, and found no significant difference between these two. So we used the Euclidean distance as the loss function.\n\n>***Q5***\n\n***A5***: Unfortunately, most of the algorithms we have researched have no open-source code or have not been tested on the SMAC environment. Reproducing these algorithms and finding the best parameters for these algorithms in the SMAC environment requires a lot of time and effort. Therefore, we did not include these methods in the comparison. We will investigate more methods and conduct experiments to compare them with APC in future work."

Since these global representations are closely related to agents' goals and rewards, agents can achieve better cooperation on MARL tasks. To validate APC, this paper evaluated the algorithm on StarCraft2, Google Research Football, and Multi-Agent Mujoco benchmarks. The results showed that APC significantly outperformed the strong baselines in centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework, including MAT-Dec, MAPPO, and fine-tuned QMIX."

There have been many actor-critic algorithms and what and why the authors select the base algorithm may be necessary for understanding the formulation. In particular, before Eq. (1) is it better to add some explanations (with references)? And for minor points, T and V are undefined. In my understanding, the critic is not the paper\u2019s original point. \n- In my understanding, Loss_{prediction} is only the original point in this paper. Is it correct? Or is there any improved point? The methodological contribution other than predicting the global representations (i.e., Loss_{prediction}) was unclear to me.\n- How about the ablation study about the GRF environment? I expected the results to be unstable, but some insights can be obtained."
