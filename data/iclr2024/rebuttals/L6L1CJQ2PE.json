                    "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of correcting and updating the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) that have been pre-trained on extensive text data. It introduces a novel approach called the MAssive Language Model Editing Network (MALMEN). MALMEN formulates the parameter shift aggregation as a least square problem, seeking the most effective parameter shifts for all facts to be injected. This approach improves the statistical significance of the editing process, mitigating the issues of gradient accumulation and the cancellation effect. Furthermore, this paper separates the computation between the hyper-network and the language model, enabling the use of arbitrary batch sizes for both neural networks. Exceptional performance on multiple knowledge-intensive tasks is a testament to MALMEN's effectiveness."

MALMEN is designed to edit multiple facts simultaneously, making it more practical for mass editing in real-world scenarios. This is a crucial aspect given the need to update the knowledge of large language models comprehensively.\n\n3.Despite being somewhat math-heavy, the paper is written in a very clear and didactic way. I found it easy to follow and an enjoyable read overall.\n\n4.Comprehensive (although not entirely convincing, see below) experiments on various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and across different LLM architectures.

Why not compare with [1], which I believe is more suitable for sequential knowledge editing?\n\nT-Patcher adds extra neurons to the FFN of the last Transformer block [1], which increases the inference cost and makes the comparison not completely fair.\nThe last paragraph of Section 5.2 of [1] writes \"In practice, we suggest using the transformer-patcher to provide timely response for each mistake online, and after accumulating certain quantities of mistakes, we could fine-tune the original model on all accumulated mistakes, so that the patches can be removed.\"\nIn this regard, MALMEN is an alternative to fine-tuning, where our goal is to edit a large number of facts simultaneously rather than updating the model sequentially.\n\n> The criteria for successful edits are, in our opinion, insufficient, in that they do not consider the portability of the edit. Previous work such as [2], introducing an additional assessment metric, portability, finding that the model-editing methods lack robustness when applied to related one-hop facts or synonyms.\n\nWe agree that including metrics such as portability can better evaluate the editing robustness.\nThe main focus of this work is to improve the scalability of meta-learning-based editing algorithm, therefore, we follow the metrics from [3].\nWe also conclude that MALMEN still fails to generalize to rephrasings not just occurring in prompts (Section 6).\nWe leave designing editing algorithms that can well generalize to one-hop facts or synonyms to future work.\n\n> Which layers to apply MALMEN? All layers or some picked layers? Section 5.2 claims that \u201cEdit first FC in FFN\u201d achieves inferior performance. How to select the layer in practical application?\n\nOur method is not limited to certain layers.\nWe suggest to only edit the second linear layer in the FFN of last few Transformer blocks (first paragraph of Section 5.1) as it is empirically sufficient and computationally efficient.\n\n> The experiments are lacking in qualitative examples, it would be helpful to analyze some success and failure cases to see where the proposed method begins to fail (e.g., with respect to generalization).\n\nWe have added qualitative analysis in Appendix A.8.\n\n> In Figure 5 and Figure 6, the starting x coordinates are inconsistent, please provide a more detailed description.

To efficiently design the back propagation for massive editing, the paper separates the backprop on LM and hyper-network such that the back props are proceeded in a cascaded way, maintaining a set of cache values.

                    "value": "This paper considers a problem of knowledge editing, which involves altering the parametric knowledge of LMs without retraining them from scratch. This work specifically focuses on the scalability of hypernetwork-based approaches, which are generally considered less effective for multiple concurrent edits. The authors claim that there are two major challenges: 1) the parameter shifts could be contradictory between the set of modified facts, and 2) accommodating a large number of edits in a hypernetwork is memory demanding. This work presents an approach that addresses these challenges. \n\nConcretely, this work extends MEND (Mitchell et al., 2022) by introducing additional parameter updates specifically for linear layers in the FFNs. Assuming that the linear layers are key-value memories, the motivation behind this is to find a better single parameter shift matrix S for _m_ updates. This additional step adjust the hypernetwork output (i.e., gradients) which is not a simple sum of gradients for different inputs. When scaling up to a large number of edits, backpropagating from the meta loss to the input is costly (e.g., computing pre and post-edit losses for each edit end to end). The proposed approach decomposes the optimization process by caching pre-edit computation (after finetuning), reducing the memory usage substantially.\n\nThe experimental setup focuses on scalability (i.e., editing thousands of facts at once), and the proposed approach is applied to different model families such as encoder-only (e.g., BERT) and  decoder-only (e.g., GPT-2 and GPT-J 6B). In addition to FT and MEND baselines, GPT-J with MEMIT is included as a baseline. For evaluation, FEVER is used for BERT, and zsRE is used for GPT models, largely following prior work. For evaluation metrics, edit success (ES \u2013 how often new facts get higher probability after editing), generalization success (GS \u2013 performance on related facts), and locality success (LS \u2013 performance of unrelated facts). In summary, the experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms FT and MEND with BERT and GPT-2, and it has better scalability compared to the original MEND. When it comes with GPT-J, which is a much larger LM, it is always better than MEND but underperforms MEMIT and FT on LS, indicating that the post-edit model forgets unrelated facts."

Please let us know if these responses have addressed your concerns and questions.\n\n> The scope of the problem (scalability of MEND) could be narrow, and the proposed approach is only applicable for a specific knowledge editing approach.\n\nOne of our main contributions is enhancing the scalability of hyper-networks via novel training and inference methods, which is orthogonal to the architecture design of hyper-networks and potentially applicable to other hyper-networks that generate a parameter shift for each fact.\nWe do not adapt new hyper-network architecture for the proposed training and inference methods as it may make it ambiguous whether the improvement comes from the changes in training and inference methods or hyper-network architecture.\n\n> Based on the experimental results, it is difficult to assert that this approach is significantly better than all other knowledge editing approaches in terms of scalability (not only MEND).\n\nMALMEN is compared with FT, MEND, and MEMIT because they all do not introduce extra parameters.\nOther editing methods with decent scalability increase the inference cost, so the comparison will not be completely fair.\nFor example, SERAC introduces a scope classifier and a counter-factual model [1]; T-Patcher adds neurons to the FFN of the last Transformer block [2].\nAlthough MEMIT also enjoys decent scalability, it is limited to decoder-only model and cannot be deployed on encoder-only and encoder-decoder models [3].\nTo our knowledge, MALMEN is the first work that edits a large number of facts on encoder-only and encoder-decoder models without introducing extra parameters.\n\n> The poor LS score with GPT-J (6B) shows that this approach still edits unrelated facts.\n\nThe trade-off between ES, GS, and LS is governed by the hyper-parameters $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{loc}}$ (the first paragraph of Section 4.2).\nA similar example is MEMIT, where increasing the covariance factor improves LS but reduces ES and GS [3]. They define the arithmetic mean of ES, GS, and LS as S and determine the value of the covariance factor using S as the metric (Appendix F.3 of [3]).\nAlthough MALMEN's LS is slightly lower than the leader on GPT-J (the gap is consistently smaller than 0.02), MALMEN has advantage in ES, GS, and the overall S.\nWe do not specifically tune hyper-parameters for each model (even they differ by more than an order of magnitude in scale) to highlight the insensitivity of our method to hyper-parameter selection.\n\n> Qualitative analysis is not provided. It\u2019s hard to see when/why this approach is beneficial without seeing error cases.\n\nWe have added qualitative analysis in Appendix A.8.\n\n> Section 4.1: The clarity of the notations could be improved, especially the parameter shift matrix S and the different matrix D. It\u2019s unclear which parameters are trainable/frozen from the notations. And, it\u2019s hard to see how those operations are applied to m edits.\n\nWe have revisited the section to make it clearer.\nTo avoid confusion, we change the definition of $\\mathcal L$ to the collection of trainable linear layers (Section 3), where parameters outside of $\\mathcal L$ are frozen (the last paragraph of Section 4.1).\n\n> \"in the case of parameter shifts generated by the hyper-network, summing them lacks statistical significance\": This sounds intuitive, but is there any theoretical or empirical research that substantiates this? [4] is mainly talking about the cancellation effect in the last layer of a transformer if I understand it correctly.\n\nMEND mimics the operation in the standard supervised learning to sum the parameter shifts.\nThe justification to do so in supervised learning is that the mean of unbiased estimators are an unbiased estimator with smaller variance.\nWe claim \"lacks statistical significance\" because the parameter shifts generated by the hyper-network do not possess similar properties.\n\nThe cancellation effect mentioned is similar to [4] at a fairly high level, where the parameter shifts corresponding to different keys exhibit significant magnitudes that counteract each other.\nWe propose an evaluation metric to measure the cancellation effect in parameter shift aggregation in Section 5.2.\nThe ablation study shows that the design of normal equation decreases the cancellation effect by about three orders of mangitude.\n\n> Did you use the original implementation of MEND? If not, it would be nice to show that the results match with your implementation.\n\nWe have added an comparison with the original implementation of MEND in Appendix A.7.\n\n> It would be nice to explain data statistics briefly.\n\nWe have added a brief data statistics in the second paragraph of Section 5.\n\n[1] Memory-based model editing at scale.\nICML 2023.\n\n[2] Transformer-patcher: One mistake worth one neuron.
