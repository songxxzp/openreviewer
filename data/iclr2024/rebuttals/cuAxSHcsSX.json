                    "value": "This paper delves into the exploration of federated learning in the context of linear contextual bandits (LCBs) while incorporating the principles of differential privacy (DP). The proposed algorithmic framework encompasses several key components, including LinUCB exploration, a distributed variant of the tree-based mechanism, privacy amplification, and a fixed batch update approach. This comprehensive approach offers compelling solutions for addressing both silo-level local DP and shuffle DP concerns. Additionally, the authors have identified and rectified an error pertaining to the total injected privacy noise, as previously reported in Dubey & Pentland 2020, contributing to the advancement of this field."

                    "value": "1. The analysis in this paper is notably meticulous, particularly in its identification of the mistake in the previous results. The presentation of the findings is commendable, as it effectively illustrates the potential privacy vulnerabilities present in Dubey & Pentland 2020. Furthermore, it compellingly highlights the necessity of a more robust silo-level local DP setting. The comparison with related work is both thorough and detailed, contributing to a well-rounded understanding of the research landscape.\n\n2. The paper provides a comprehensive narrative that encompasses regret and communication guarantees under varying privacy constraints. Impressively, the authors extend these guarantees to a broader range of privacy parameters, demonstrating a thorough exploration of the subject matter. Moreover, the novel extension of the current amplification analysis to their specific case adds a valuable dimension to the research."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The paper, while containing valuable insights, may benefit from some improvements in terms of clarity and presentation. Firstly, the algorithmic design, which incorporates several components and explores various privacy settings, could be made more accessible by summarizing the results in a table format. This would provide readers with a quick and clear overview of corresponding regret, communication, and algorithmic elements across different settings. Additionally, in terms of organization, it might be helpful to reconsider the placement of the concluding remarks, which currently reside under the simulation results. Furthermore, there appears to be a spacing issue in the section discussing the tree-based mechanism, possibly resulting from the authors' use of the vspace command in LaTeX.\n\n2. While the paper offers valuable contributions, the novelty and inspiration of the problem itself could be further developed. The concept of silo-level Local Differential Privacy (LDP), while important and rigorous, may be considered relatively straightforward to formulate. Additionally, the solutions presented in the paper largely draw upon existing results and algorithmic designs, rather than introducing fundamentally new insights or modifications to established findings, which limits the potential of this paper."

We have added a summary table in the introduction to summarize our main results.\n\n**Placement of the concluding remarks and use of vspace:** Fixed both. The conclusion is now a separate section in our new version. \n\n**On our new results:** We agree with the reviewer that silo-level LDP and SDP are relatively straightforward to formulate since these notions are widely adopted in supervised learning problems. In this work, we adapt them to a sequential learning problem of linear contextual bandits.\n\nHowever, in order to establsih our regret bounds, we have introduced two new results, since directly applying exsiting techniques or algorithms for supervised learning do not work in sequential learning.\n\n\n- First, we point out that simply adding an additional shuffler between the agents and server to Algorithm 1 in Dubey & Pentland, 2020  is not sufficient to achieve \"optimal\" regret under SDP. Instead, the shuffle mechanism must be thoughtfully integrated into the tree-based algorithm to shuffle the p-sums rather than prefix sums (which is the case for standard shuffle mechanism).\n\n- Second, we highlight that one cannot merely rely on existing privacy amplification lemmas to achieve SDP. We have derived a **new result** on privacy amplification for shuffling DP mechanisms where the dataset size is greater than one, as opposed to the standard results where the dataset size is equal to one.\n\nFinally, for the regret analysis, our approach to bound the \"local drift\" under fixed-batch schedule is different from the approach under adaptive schedule."

It seems that this paper is motivated by clear holes in the work of Dubey and Petland (2020), which is a highly cited paper. This work succinctly identifies the errors in that paper, as well as proposes their own solution. It is quite remarkable, since that work is well cited, but the arguments of the authors seem convincing to me. \n\nIn addition to showing the errors with that work, this work further develops a variant of LinUCB that provides the required level of privacy, and computes the regret bound. Another variant is considered where shuffle DP is used, which enables regret equal to the regret achieved by the super node."

Regarding your sharp comment on the binary-tree-based algorithm, here is our clarification.\n\nThe key behind the binary-tree-based mechanism is the summation structure in parmater estimates. For linear models, the least-square estimate can be written in closed-form using two summations, one over bias vectors and another over covariance matrices. However, for GLM, the maximum likelihood estimate doesn't have a closed-form based on these summations. As a result, one needs to resort to other privacy mechanisms (e.g., objective perturbation), see [R1].\n\n[R1] Chen, Xi, David Simchi-Levi, and Yining Wang. \"Privacy-preserving dynamic personalized pricing with demand learning.\" Management Science 68, no. 7 (2022): 4878-4898."

I would suggest the authors first justify both DP notions in federated contextual bandits (especially SDP), and then state their corresponding results.\n\n- Related to the first point, it would be nice to add some discussions on whether the $M^{1/4}$ gap from centralized performance can be closed; otherwise, the significance of the result is hard to measure.\n\n- In terms of the DP techniques, I understand that there are many different choices and this work adopts two certain ones. It would be nice to clarify whether the adopted ones are necessary or if there are other feasible choices.\n\n- The fixed batch size selection potentially can be improved. Although performing adaptive communication protocol is no longer feasible, it might still be a good choice to have the batch length exponentially growing (as in many low-switching bandit studies) instead of being a fixed one.\n\n- A recent work [R1] studies a different kind of DP notion in federated contextual bandits.

                        "value": "We first thank the reviewer for providing sharp comments and great suggestions. Please find our clarifications below. \n\n**Close the gap under silo-level LDP:** Thanks for the keen comment. It turns out that the first step to obtain a lower bound for Federated LCBs under silo-level LDP is to establish a tight characterization of regret for single-agent LCBs under central JDP.\n\nTo see this, one can use a similar reduction as in [Lowy & Razaviyayn' 2021], where the authors derive a lower bound in the supervised learning setting under silo-level LDP. Specifically, for any silo-level LDP algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$ with privacy guarantee $\\epsilon$, one can first \"virtually\" shuffle all $MT$ user sequences and then apply $\\mathcal{A}$, leading to a shuffled version $\\mathcal{A}_s$. \nThe shuffled version algorithm $\\mathcal{A}_s$ has an SDP privacy guarantee of roughly $\\epsilon/\\sqrt{M}$. Since SDP implies central JDP in LCBs, one can conclude that $\\mathcal{A}_s$ has a lower bound of $L_c(\\epsilon/\\sqrt{M})$, where  $L_c(\\epsilon)$ \ndenotes the regret lower bound for LCBs under central JDP with privacy $\\epsilon'$. Since $\\mathcal{A}$ and $\\mathcal{A}'$ have same regret performance, this yields a regret lower bound $L_c(\\epsilon/\\sqrt{M})$ for $\\mathcal{A}$ under silo-level LDP.\n\nTo our best knowledge, the existing lower bound for LCBs under central JDP is $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T} + 1/\\epsilon')$ [R0], which implies a lower bound $L_c(\\epsilon')=\\Omega(\\sqrt{MT} + 1/\\epsilon')$ in the centralized setting (super-single agent). By the above argument, setting $\\epsilon'=\\epsilon/\\sqrt{M}$, this implies a lower bound $\\Omega(\\sqrt{MT} + \\sqrt{M}/\\epsilon)$ under silo-level LDP, whereas our upper bound is $O(M^{3/4}\\sqrt{T/\\epsilon})$. That is, privacy cost in lower bound is only additive $\\sqrt{M}/\\epsilon$, whereas in our upper bound is a multiplicative $M^{1/4}/\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$. It is unclear to us which one of these is loose. Hence, whether the regret gap can be closed under silo-level LDP without resorting to SDP remains an open question.\n\n Now, if one can prove a lower bound $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T/\\epsilon'})$ for single-agent LCBs under central JDP, then it would yield a lower bound $L_c(\\epsilon') =\\Omega(\\sqrt{MT/\\epsilon'})$ in the centralized setting, which would further imply a lower bound of $\\Omega(M^{3/4}\\sqrt{T/\\epsilon})$ under silo-level LDP, and would close the regret gap.\n\n We have included this discussion in Appendix G.1. We believe our findings in this paper (e.g., identifying existing gaps and establishing new upper bounds) would motivate these interesting open questions.\n\n[R0] Jiahao He, Jiheng Zhang, and Rachel Zhang. A reduction from linear contextual bandit lower bounds\nto estimation lower bound, ICML'22\n\n**Other DP techniques:** One can indeed have the flexibility of choosing other DP techniques in our privacy protocol. In fact, this is the beauty of our proposed protocol. For example, one may replace our Vallina tree-based algorithm with other advanced techniques to improve constant factors in privacy parameters, e.g., a low-variance tree-based algorithm [R1] or some online matrix mechanisms [R2, R3]. For silo-level LDP, instead of Gaussian noise, one can use Wishart Noise as in [Sharif&Sheffet'18]. For SDP, instead of vector sum protocol, one can use some advanced SDP protocols, e.g., [R4, R5]\n\n[R1] James Honaker. Efficient use of differentially private binary trees.

In contrast to standard MABs and linear bandits with stochastic contexts, it is not clear to us how to use exponentially growing batch schedule to derive meaningful regret bound in the setting of linear bandit with *adversarial contexts* and infinite actions (which is the setting of this paper). The only method we are aware of is the *rarely switching principle* (e.g. determinant trick) in [R1], which is the core idea behind adaptive communication in linear bandits, but not feasible in our case due to potential risk of privacy leakage. In fact, [R2] lists an open problem regarding the determinant trick under DP, even in the single-agent setting.\n\n[R1] Abbasi-Yadkori, Y., P\u00e1l, D., & Szepesv\u00e1ri, C. \"Improved algorithms for linear stochastic bandits\".

We have included it in the main paper (highlighted in brown color on page 3). We have also provided the following discussions in Appendix A.\n\n\u201cRecently, Huang et al. (2023) took the pioneering step to study user-level privacy for federated LCBs,\nestablishing both regret upper bounds and lower bounds. In contrast to our item-level DP (e.g.,\nsilo-level LDP), user-level DP in Huang et al. (2023) roughly requires that even replacing the whole\nlocal history at any agent, the central server\u2019s broadcast message should be close across the whole\nlearning period. This notion is more likely to be preferred in cross-device FL settings where the\nprotection target is the device (agent). In addition to this, there are several key differences compared to\nour work. First, they deal with linear bandits with stochastic contexts under additional\ndistribution coverage assumptions (rather than the arbitrary adversary contexts in our case). In fact, it has\nbeen shown by Huang et al. (2023) that some assumption on the context distribution is necessary\nfor a sublinear regret under user-level DP. Second, due to this stochastic context and some coverage\nconditions on contexts, an exponentially growing batch schedule can be applied in their case. In\ncontrast, under the adversary context case, it is unclear to us how to apply the same technique to\nderive a sublinear regret.\u201d\n\n**On smooth transition to SDP:** Thanks for the suggestion. We have updated the transition from silo-level LDP to SDP, highlighted in brown color on Page 3."
