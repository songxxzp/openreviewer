I encourage the authors to have a broader discussion surrounding pruning-based compression methods.\n- Though the proposed method is well and clearly written. I find it hard to form an intuitive understanding of why it could outperform methods like SparseGPT, which also uses second-order information for pruning and weight recovery. To have a high level discussions about the it\u2019s underlying difference would be very helpful.\n- Comparison to stronger baselines such as wandb is lacking. Since wandb is a more efficient method (does not require gradients or second order information) for semi-structured pruning and outperforms SparseGPT, the authors should compare their method to wandb in terms of both performance and efficiency. This would lead to better understanding the advantages of the proposed approach."

For example, the authors could discuss the impact of pruning on model interpretability, the effect of pruning on model robustness, and the scalability of the proposed method to larger LLMs.\n\n3. Insufficient discussion on the computational cost and GPU/CPU speedup of the proposed method: While the paper briefly mentions that PGZ can be parallelized and used for zero-shot tasks, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method and inference speedup of the model after pruning. Specifically, the authors could provide more insights into the training time, memory requirements, and other computational costs associated with PGZ and also for the model after pruning."
