Particularly, this paper proposes a method that leverages the diffusion model to accurately model the ID data distribution and generate OOD data samples. Concretely, the proposed method involves three steps: training a diffusion model to fit the data distribution within the compact latent space, designing a KNN-based density-based filter to obtain low-density samples, and using these samples to train the OOD detector, which is very complex. In the experiments, the proposed method is evaluated on two datasets. And this paper does not outperform the compared method significantly. And the authors do not compare with state-of-the-art methods."

In Introduction Section, the authors directly indicate that they propose OpenDiffusion to leverage the diffusion model to fit data distributions and generate data samples. However, I am not clear why the proposed method could address the analyzed problem. The authors should give more interpretations. Meanwhile, why the authors do not use other generative methods, e.g., VAE and GANs?\n\n2. For OOD task, since diffusion method has impressive generative performance, it is an commonly used mechanism to generate data. Thus, the proposed idea is not novel. Meanwhile, this paper does not sufficiently analyze the corresponding advantages of the proposed diffusion method. Finally, the proposed method mainly includes there steps: training a diffusion model to fit the data distribution within the compact latent space, designing a KNN-based density-based filter to obtain low-density samples, and using these samples to train the OOD detector, which is very complex.\n\n3. This paper does not give any theoretical contributions. In the experiments, for PASCAL VOC dataset, the proposed method does not outperform VOS significantly. The authors should give more interpretations. Meanwhile, the proposed method only compare VOS and SIREN-KNN. And it does not compare state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the methods from CVPR 2023 and ICCV 2023. To the best of my knowledge, the performance of this paper is significantly weaker than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n4. The proposed method is very complex. The proposed method involves multiple operations. The authors should give more ablation experiments. The visualization in Figure 4 is not clear. The authors should give more interpretations."

I think the tone of this contribution should be lowered.\\\n(2) I am also skeptical of the main idea of employing the generative model's faulty region as pseudo-OOD data, which relies on the flaw of the diffusion model. Ideally, when the diffusion model can be able to generate in-distribution data perfectly, then what does the proposed algorithm of the paper become?\\\n(3) The paper's empirical performance is also weak. I can find several previously published works [2,3] that outperform the proposed method by a large amount. Furthermore, the proposed filtering strategy only improves by a small amount according to Table 3.\\\n(4) Since the method trains and generates data through the diffusion model, extra computational cost during training is non-negligible. Authors should specify such extra computation costs.\\\n(5) Back to the novelty, I can find similar work that also synthesizes outliers from the boundary or low-density regions [4,5]. I do not think applying a similar idea to the diffusion model is not strikingly novel or surprising.\\\n(6) While this idea can be extended to a classification setting, I highly doubt that this is an effective synthesis strategy compared to existing methods unless further experiments are done. Consider applying the algorithm in the classification setting.\n\nOverall, I do not think the idea is relatively new or the performance of the paper is that significant. I am leaning toward rejecting the paper."

Please make more clear your contribution.\n- It seems there is a confusion between outliers and OOD samples. Outliers belong to the seen classes (low density areas) whereas OOD samples belong to classes which have not been seen during training. It seems that your diffusion model generates outliers in low-density areas which are considered as OOD samples. Please clarify this aspect.\n- Maybe I missed this point, but how do you define in your protocol which are ID and OOD classes? This question applies to all the datasets you considered for the experimental validation."

To address this limitation, the paper introduces a novel approach that utilizes a diffusion model to generate OOD samples. Additionally, a filtering strategy based on K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is employed to identify and retain only those generated samples that belong to low-density regions of the ID data.

The author merely mentions using a filter to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples while avoiding samples that are too far from ID. Although this intuitively makes sense, the article lacks theoretical support or specific examples to illustrate what kind of samples would be considered ID or excessively far OOD.\n\n2. In Table 2, the author compares the effectiveness of different generation methods, but from the results, diffusion does not seem to have a significant advantage. In general generation tasks, diffusion is usually considered superior to GANs. The relationship between the performance of the generation model and its improvement on OOD tasks is not analyzed.\n\n3. The paper introduces a filter to distinguish between ID and OD based on a threshold. However, the selection and stability of this threshold are not discussed in detail. Additionally, there is no discussion on how to determine which samples are considered excessively far OOD samples using the filter."
