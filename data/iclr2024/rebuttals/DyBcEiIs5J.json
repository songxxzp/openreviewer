For example, in the caption in Figure 2, WRL is an unsupervised contrastive learning method while in Section 2, a supervised loss is used during training, which is confusing."

Is multi-queue MoCo part of WRL or SRR? From Figure 2, multi-queue is part of SRR, but as described in the main text, it\u2019s part of WRL.\n3. How is the generalization ability of the model trained on synthetic data? If the model trained on synthetic data can't be generalized to the real dataset, the contribution of the synthetic dataset is limited."

How does the inclusion of different sub-queues affect this loss function?\n4.  can it be ensured that different sub-queues contain crowds from different weather conditions? Since this is an unsupervised approach, it can be assumed that images with similar properties could be assigned to the same category. The question is whether the properties learned from the multi-queue MoCo represent weather information.\n5. The SRR stage requires a label for the normal condition. How is this label defined based on the sub-queues?\n6. The GCC[1] dataset contains weather information (7 weather types) for each image. Perhaps the authors could analyze their unsupervised WRL on this dataset. Specifically, they can directly apply their method to this dataset and compare the unsupervised results with the provided ground truth to demonstrate whether the model performs as expected."

I think the authors should have a discussion.\n\nThe experiments are not convincing. First, as shown in Tab.2, compared with previous methods, the performance of adverse samples is improved by sacrificing the performance of a portion of normal samples. Second, the authors should report the average performance of the whole dataset, not only normal and adverse. Third, compared with previous SOTA, the proposed method does not have significant performance gain.\n\nWhat about the cross-domain performance? e.g., training on JHU-Crowd and testing on NWPU-Crowd weather."
