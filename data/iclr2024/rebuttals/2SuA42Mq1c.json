The overarching claim of a \u201cuniversal and fair\u201d benchmark appears difficult to substantiate, as representation from five domains necessarily remains a small subset of possible image anomaly cases in medicine. The degree of fairness regarding domain selection might be further justified. For example, thin structures appear relatively less represented.\n2. As raised in the Introduction, a common practical concern for anomaly detection in the medical domain is when some (more-common) disease classes are known and labelled/annotated, but other rarer classes not in the initially known set of diseases may occur. Some analysis of such tasks might thus be relevant.\n3. A number of minor spelling/grammatical errors might be addressed, e.g. \u201ca fair comparing among these methods\u201d, \u201cwell-structure, easy-use codebase\u201d, \u201csamll tumor localization\u201d, \u201clarge pre-train models\u201d, etc."

                        "value": "Thank you for acknowledging our effort in curating this benchmark. Our point-to-point feedback is as follow.\n\n**Regarding technical novelty**\n\nWe appreciate your concern, as it gives us an opportunity to clarify the focus of our work. This work primarily revolves around providing a well-structured benchmark for medical anomaly detection, rather than introducing new algorithms. However, the contributions of our work extend beyond data curation. Notably, the field of medical anomaly detection has suffered from a lack of a standardized evaluation benchmark, resulting in data citation errors and inconsistent experimental settings in numerous published studies. Our benchmark aims to bridge this critical gap by offering a standardized and unified codebase and evaluation protocol for fair algorithm assessment. Both the complete codebase and a comprehensive analysis of existing algorithms across various medical modalities facilitate the development of improved anomaly detection models for medical data.\n\n**Regarding \"universal and fair\" benchmark**\n\nIn our study, we use the term \"universal and fair\" to emphasize that the codebase and evaluation protocol remain consistent across all evaluated algorithms and datasets. This approach is intended to rectify the prevailing issues of inconsistent evaluation practices and data partitioning in the current literature. We apologize if the use of \"universal and fair\" has caused any confusion for the reviewer.\n\n**Regarding the purpose of medical anomaly detection**\n\nit's important to note that the primary goal of anomaly detection differs from classifying known diseases; it is focused on detecting abnormalities in an open-set setting. In the context of medical image classification, assembling a comprehensive training set covering all possible scenarios, especially rare diseases and unprecedented anomalies, is impractical. The inherent open-set nature of medical data collection implies that supervised classification based on an incomplete training set may lead to misclassification. Anomaly detection serves as a solution to address this open-set problem and complements the limitations of supervised learning. We plan to incorporate this discussion in our revision.\n\n**Regarding typos**\n\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out these typos. We will thoroughly proofread the manuscript to address these issues."

Aside from the work itself, here is the the second motivation that we submitted this benchmark to ICLR. Almost all SOTA anomaly detection methods have been tested on natural images or industry images. However, due to the significant domain gap between medical images and natural/industrial images, these methods do not perform well in medical anomaly detection (as shown in the manuscript). Since anomaly detection itself is a form of data-efficient learning, we hope that the results and insights from this benchmark can attract more scholars to focus on this field and propose more generic methods to address these issues."

Below are our point-to-point response to your comments\n\n**Regarding evaluation visualizations:**\n\nThanks for this comment. We plan to add bar plots of the numerical results in Table 2 and more anomaly detection examples in the revision.\n\n**Regarding codebase availability:**\n\nThe codebase and the curated datasets will be posted on a dedicated GitHub page for public access. Detailed documentation will be provided there as well. We plan to maintain the GitHub page to include more datasets and new algorithms.\n\n**Regarding bias in datasets:**\n\nAs commented in our manuscript, we realized the bias in the current datasets. We plan to include more medical anomaly detection datasets in this benchmark. We will pay attention to this issue in data preparation and hopefully the new datasets will help address the bias issue.\n\n**Regarding hyperparameter setting:**\n\nIn this study, we did not extensively fine-tune hyper-parameters. Instead, we experimented with various combinations to achieve model convergence when the original settings don\u2019t work. We kept hyper-parameters related to loss terms consistent with the original papers. Detailed experimental data and trials will be included in the revision."

From the section 4.1 implementation details, the authors seem to follow default settings first and then tune the learning rate/threshold only. Other important hyper-parameters, such as the weighting terms in losses, seem to be missing. It would also be very helpful to document the results using each combination so readers would know what works and what doesn't, which will also improve the reproducibility of a benchmark study.\n\n3. It would be interesting to have a section discussing the robustness of each algorithm analyzed in training (e.g. which is easier to converge)."
