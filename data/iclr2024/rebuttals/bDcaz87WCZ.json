A new graph profiler method was then introduce to tackle RLC. Moreover, the authors also proposed new quality metrics (e.g., edge homophily and Matthews correlation coefficient). Experiments on a set of dynamic graph datasets preliminaries validated the quality of the proposed method w.r.t. the RLC task."

                    "value": "**W1. The motivations of some statements and designs are unclear.**\n\nIn Section 1, why the fact that 'FLP is sensitive to non-architectural hyperparameters' can begs a question regarding DNC, i.e., 'in analogy to the dynamic node classification task, is there a temporal link classification task we can define?' From my perspective, the relationships between FLP and RLC are also not fully discussed. At the very beginning of the paper, it is highly recommended to add a toy running example (e.g., a simple dynamic graph) to illustrate what are FLP, DNC, and RLC, as well as their inherent relationships.\n  \nIn the design of profile encoder, what are the motivations to introduce metapaths? As I known, metapaths are usually used in the graph representation learning of heterogeneous graphs, but it seems that the authors only consider (dynamic) homogeneous graphs in this study. Moreover, metapaths are also not illustrated in Fig. 1 (i.e., the model architecture).\n  \nThere are no intuitive motivations regarding the proposed metrics of edge homophily and Matthews correlation coefficient (e.g., why Matthews correlation coefficient can handle the label-imbalanced issue). As a results, it is unclear what are their advantages beyond conventional quality metrics.\n  \n***\n  \n**W2. The problem statements in Section 3 are unclear and even confusing. Some presentation and statements seem to be inconsistent.**\n  \nIn the 1st paragraph of Section 3, the availability of graph attributes (e.g., inputs of node and edge features) are not mentioned. However, as stated in the 2nd paragraph, edges attributes are treated as inputs of RLC. It is unclear that whether graph attributes (in terms of node attributes/features or edge attributes/features) are considered in this paper. If so, are they assumed to be static (for all time steps) or they are also dynamic?\n  \nAt the very beginning of Section 3, it is suggested to highlight which data model (i.e., discrete-time dynamic graph or continuous-time dynamic graph) that the authors adopted in this paper.\n  \nThe formal definitions of FLP and DNC are not given. For both FLP and DNC, there are transductive and inductive settings. The formal definitions regarding the transductive and inductive of RLC are not given. It is also unclear that the authors only consider the transductive setting or both transductive and inductive settings.\n\n'Profile' is a significant concept in the proposed method, e.g., profile encoder, node profile, etc. However, there seems no definition regarding this concept (e.g., what are profiles in real dynamic graphs and in terms of what).\n\nAccording to the statements in Section 3, each edge in a (dynamic) graphs should be associated with a time step. However, the graphs in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 seem to be static. Furthermore, edge attributes are also not illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2.\n\n***\n\n**W3. Experiments are too simple. Some details regarding experiment settings are also unclear.**\n\nIn experiments, there are only two baseline methods (i.e., TGN and GraphMixer), which cannot fully validate the superiority of the proposed method. In addition to the two baselines, there are also some other dynamic graph representation learning methods (e.g., TGAT, DySAT, EvolveGCN, etc.) as mentioned in Section 2 that can be included in experiments. Experiment results of GraphMixer are not given in Table 3, Fig. 4, etc. In Table 1, the number of timesteps and the number of classed are not given for each dataset. The quality metric w.r.t. the results in Table 3 is not mentioned in the caption.  \n\n***\n\n**W4. The major contributions of this paper are unclear and not fully verified.**\n  \nAlthough the authors claimed that they proposed a new temporal graph learning task (i.e., RLC) and new quality metrics (i.e., edge homophily and MCR), their advantages beyond existing techniques (e.g., what are the advantages of treating RLC as a new temporal graph learning task beyond FLP and DNC) are not fully discussed in the paper and not fully validated in experiments, due to the unclear motivations and insufficient experiments.\n\n***\n\n**W5. The overall presentation is poor. In addition to the inconsistent presentation mentioned before, there are also some grammatical errors and typos that need careful revisions.**\n\n1) 'analyze the temporal graph learning architectures divindign categorizing the methods literature into two groups'\n\n2) 'edges$\\mathcal{E}$'\n\n3) 'we construct derived graphs that'\n\n4) 'connect a vertex acting that acts as a source to another that acts as a course through a shared destination vertex'\n\n5) 'on abuse-like like datasets'"

We are developing a plan to address the weaknesses that you have identified, and we would like to confirm with you that this plan would address your concerns.\n\n- W1: We will add a simple illustrative example indicating the differences between FLP, RLC, and DNC.\n- W1: The graphs that are currently considered are all bipartite and heterogeneous with interactions typically being between a user \u2192 item. This is not required for the RLC task in general, but is the structure of our dataset under consideration. In such a setting, we would argue that the metapath construction is a relatively natural fit.\n- W1: Metric uncertainty - We will add an illustrative example that highlights situations where MCC can correctly handle label imbalance but more traditional metrics cannot. In addition, we will leverage the edge homophily definition to explain aspects of our results, in analogy to the discussion of node homophily for node classification.\n- W2: We will rework the problem statement to address the lack of clarity. Specifically, we will make clear that we are working in a continuous time setting, the source of our edge features, and the transductive nature of the problem.\n- W2: We will clarify the definition of a profile in this setting, rather than depending on the colloquial definition.\n- W2: The graphs in the figures are illustrative but they are dynamic based on the content of the containers. We will make this more clear in the text and figure captions\n- W3: We will add two additional datasets, one based on video game reviews and one on NFT sales, and baselines from GraphMixer and TGAT. The NFT sales dataset is considerably larger than the ones in the current work.\n- W4: We will rework the text to highlight the importance of our new task and more clearly explain how it differs from FLP and DNC; and we will use that to further motivate our discussion about the value of this new task. We hope that by addressing the metrics as we have planned in W1, and clearly explaining the value of RLC, we can address W4.\n- W5: We thank the reviewer for pointing out typos and other places where the work lacks clarity. We will address those, and carefully edit the paper to catch others.\n\nWe aim to have this work completed before the end of the review process, so that we can address any additional concerns that you may have. Please do let us know if this plan of action is insufficient to address your points.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nThe Authors"

We are developing a plan to address the weaknesses that you have identified, and we would like to confirm with you that this plan would address your concerns.\n- Our Graph Profiler method is novel in so far as, to our knowledge, the concept of building time-dependent profiles for entities based on based on the features and labels of their previous interactions  is not something we are aware of. In contrast, TGN learns a graph wide memory. We will update the text to make this point clear. Also, we believe that we have additional contributions, including the introduction of a new research task, an associated figure of merit, and baseline results. We will rework the text to further emphasize these contributions.\n- On the topic of extensive evaluations being required, we will add two additional datasets, one based on video game reviews and one on NFT sales, and baselines from GraphMixer and TGAT. The NFT sales dataset is considerably larger than the ones in the current work.\n- On the topic of critical design principles, we will rework the text to emphasize that these principles comprise the design space for a family of models.\n- We will include our investigations of the identified design space for the FLP in an appendix and make reference to it in the main text. \n\nWe aim to have this work completed before the end of the review process, so that we can address any additional concerns that you may have. Please do let us know if this plan of action is insufficient to address your points.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nThe Authors"

We are developing a plan to address the weaknesses that you have identified, and we would like to confirm with you that this plan would address your concerns.\n- We thank the reviewer for pointing this areas where the methods discussion is unclear, and we will work to improve that. We will do so specifically by expanding upon details of our model, dimensions of matrices, and other model details; as well as the way in which we\u2019ve constructed the dataset.\n- We will expand our definition of edge homophily to be easier to understand.\n- We will add 2 additional datasets and additional benchmark results to make the analysis a bit more involved.\n- Knowledge Graph Link Prediction (KGLP) is a related problem but is different for multiple reasons. The first is that in RLC, the prediction is performed conditioned on the existence of the link. The second is that KGLP implies an ontological structure to the relationships which can naturally be leveraged.\n- As for the question of additional metrics, we will add plots of the edge-homophily over time and a metric that we are referring to as balanced edge homophily.\n- We will address the typos through a thorough editing process.\n- We will review the rest of the paper to ensure that formulas like that for $d_1$ are motivated and clear.\n\nWe aim to have this work completed before the end of the review process, so that we can address any additional concerns that you may have. Please do let us know if this plan of action is insufficient to address your points.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nThe Authors"

The authors evaluate baseline methods for future link prediction and temporal graph learning in recent link classification, employing the Mathews Correlation Coefficient as the evaluation metric. Their proposed Graph Profiler architecture consists of five components: profile encoder, message encoder, destination encoder, and a readout layer for information aggregation. The study delves into various strategies for the profile encoder, time encoder, and readout layer, demonstrating performance enhancements over baseline methods."

It would be beneficial to elucidate insights or provide general guidance for determining an optimal combination on new datasets. For instance, what factors contribute to the observed performance variation, and is there a rationale for the less effective performance of learnable time-encoding on the Wikipedia dataset?\n2. Given that the src-dst-msg-t configuration doesn't generally yield the best results, I am wondering about the necessity of introducing seemingly redundant components like the destination encoder. Additionally, the observed performance degradation in cases where time encoding is added to src-dst raises questions. Is there any explanation for that?\n3. The presented task bears similarities to entity relationship classification in NLP. It would be interesting to discuss the similarities and differences between these two tasks.\n4. The proposed method mainly combines several existing methods together, which makes the technical contribution of method design not very high.\n\n\nMinor comment:\n1. The paper contains several typos, and certain sentences are challenging to comprehend.\n2. The captions in the graph are too small to read."
