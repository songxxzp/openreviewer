I think it's also confusing to call the loss on the test set an out-of-distribution (OOD) loss, as the test set (usually) comes from the same domain/distribution as the training set and is not OOD.\n\nThe current evaluation is also limited to only LSUN and ImageNet (and one more plant dataset though I can't find the evaluation for that) and only for discriminative tasks. It would be helpful to scale this to other tasks, datasets, and model architectures to see if the findings stil hold for those cases."

The main contributions are:\n\n- Proposes a framework and notation for fitting learning curves from performance samples on small training volumes. \n\n- Introduces a model to simulate learning curve behavior and generate synthetic results. The model captures the three key regions of learning curves: the small data region, power law region, and irreducible error region.\n\n- Evaluates several sampling strategies on the simulated learning curves as well as three real image classification datasets. Strategies differ in number of volumes sampled, volume sizes, and sampling frequencies. \n\n- Finds that sampling two volumes with a wide spread provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and cost. Sampling more volumes or sampling volumes more often does not improve results much. A wider spread of volumes leads to better performance prediction.\n\n- Overall, shows that sampling models on small subsets can produce learning curve fits that allow predicting the best performing model on the full dataset while reducing overall training time. The paper examines how to do this sampling efficiently.\n\nIn summary, the paper introduces the concept of learning curve estimation for model performance prediction and systematically studies different sampling strategies for this task. The simulated learning curve model and analysis on real datasets provide insights into efficient learning curve sampling."

(2022b) and subset sampling in the paper. Isn't collecting more data similar to using a subset of a bigger set and using more later in rounds? \n\n- The conclusions about optimal sampling strategies could be better quantified, rather than relying on interpreting the graphs. Statistical tests or performance indexes could help concretize the differences.\n\n- Only image classification with CNNs is considered. Expanding the evaluation to other domains (NLP, speech, etc) and model types would strengthen generalizability. \n\n- Additional sampling strategies could be proposed and evaluated, such as non-uniform sampling frequencies or active learning approaches. This may uncover better approaches.\n\n- The simulated learning curve model relies on several parameters. Sensitivity analysis on these parameters could be insightful.\n\n- The costs are defined abstractly in terms of training volume. Incorporating actual runtimes/FLOPs could give more practical insights.\n\n- The power law learning curve form is assumed without much justification. Discussion of limitations or comparisons to other forms could add depth.\n\nOverall, while the paper introduces a useful framework, the limited gains shown so far temper the impact. Expanding the empirical analysis and strengthening the conclusions would help in assessing the viability of the approach. Please let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or if you have any other specific guidance on improving the constructive critical analysis. I appreciate you taking the time to help me provide meaningful feedback."

However, it appears that when using a single subset (i_1) on ImageNet, most of the model selection performance is achieved. This finding does not support the importance of employing the neural scaling law in this case since the selection mechanism relies solely on validation performance and does not estimate the neural scaling laws.\n\n- I believe that the clarity of the paper could be enhanced to better describe its main contributions and the technical implementation and evaluation of these contributions. Specifically:\n    - In general, it seems that the primary objective of neural scaling is to predict the performance as data scales and use this information for model selection at a smaller scale. Therefore, I am not entirely clear about what the paper's main contribution is. Is it a specific instantiation of model selection using neural scaling law designed for visual tasks?\n    - It's unclear why the paper reports out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy when it appears to come from the same distribution as the training data.\n     - In the experimental section, more information is needed regarding the actual performance achieved on ImageNet and other datasets, as well as details about the range of hyperparameters explored. Additionally, there is mention of results for the Plant dataset in Section 5, but the paper only presents results for ImageNet and LSUN. Is the synthetic dataset used in the experimental section?\n\nThese suggestions could help improve the paper's clarity and better convey its main contributions and evaluation process."

It would be valuable to discuss the limitations of this assumption and explore how the proposed methodology performs when the power-law relationship does not hold.\n* Sensitivity to Dataset and Model Choice: The evaluation is conducted with a specific set of convolutional neural network architectures and datasets. It's important to acknowledge that the effectiveness of the proposed strategies may vary with different datasets and model types. A more extensive evaluation on a wider range of datasets and model architectures would strengthen the generalizability of the findings.\n* Statistical Significance of Results: The paper mentions conducting each strategy 30 times and reporting mean results and standard deviations.
