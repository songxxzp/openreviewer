We are focusing more on the methodology development for real wold cases. The real world unsupervised learning problems like the credit card risk control studies are very complicated. Currently there is no specific approach to this problem. DAGMM seems to be one of the most adaptable method so far. It combining traditional unsupervised methods and deep auto encoders together, and achieved some good results. However, in practice, sample features are constructed artificially, which makes the representation of samples is not comprehensive enough. Therefore, the difference between abnormal samples and normal samples is limited, and the model can not distinguish them very well. Further more, this unsupervised algorithm cannot use the overdue information effectively because of the absence of abnormal labels for transactions. MILAD are designed for solving the anomaly detection problems in these applications similar to the credit card risk control study."

The focus of the paper is on controlling credit card delinquency risk by identifying abnormal transactions. The existing methods do not effectively use transaction data to detect abnormal transactions, making it difficult to control the risk of overdue payments.\nMILAD is designed to address this problem by analyzing users' monthly transactions and payment history using deep learning networks. It utilizes both transaction and payment information to detect exceptions. The performance of MILAD is compared with DAGMM, the most commonly used unsupervised deep learning algorithm for credit card risk control. The results show that MILAD effectively controls overdue risk by utilizing both transaction and payment information."

However, it's essential to calculate and report the standard deviation in addition to the mean for experimental results. This information helps assess the variability in the model's performance.\n>While the paper mentions the computational resources used, there is no discussion of the actual resource utilization. Given that the algorithm employs transformer, attention, aggregation, and classification networks, it is important to address the computational expense associated with these components to ensure a comprehensive comparison with DAGMM.\n>The paper mentions using AUC for evaluating model performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of sequence anomaly detection. However, the authors should consider using a more comprehensive set of evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a more well-rounded view of the algorithm's performance, ensuring a complete evaluation.\n\nHow about datasets having only one fraudulent transaction? DAGMM requires at least two anomalies to be applicable. However, there are many real-world instances where there is one anomaly==fraudulent transaction. How does the method behave in such cases? Benchmark comparisons are not enough. For some reason, tree-based methods (dbTAI, MGBTAI) , Elliptic Envelope, Isolation Forest etc, have been ignored."

Regularization methods, such as dropout or weight decay can help mitigate overfitting and improve model generalization.\n>Has the MILAD algorithm been tested or analyzed for its generalizability on datasets and industries beyond credit card fraud detection? For example, exploring its effectiveness in stock trading scenarios where labels are available only for entire trading sessions, not individual trades, would be intriguing. Such experiments could showcase the algorithm's adaptability and utility in diverse contexts."

The real world unsupervised learning problems like the credit card risk control studies are very complicated. Currently there is no specific approach to this problem. DAGMM seems to be one of the most adaptable method so far. It combining traditional unsupervised methods and deep auto encoders together, and achieved some good results. However, in practice, sample features are constructed artificially, which makes the representation of samples is not comprehensive enough. Therefore, the difference between abnormal samples and normal samples is limited, and the model can not distinguish them very well. Further more, this unsupervised algorithm cannot use the overdue information effectively because of the absence of abnormal labels for transactions. MILAD are designed for solving the anomaly detection problems in these applications similar to the credit card risk control study."
