Also, an important strength of the paper is that the paper\u2019s evaluation considers many state-of-the-art LLMs used for in-context learning purposes to solve the problem of misinformation detection."

                    "value": "While I believe that this study is an important research effort, I have some concerns with the way that the paper conducts the experiments and the interpretation of the results. Below, I provide more details on my main concerns with the paper.\n\nFirst, the paper\u2019s evaluation is done on a very small scale, particularly 100 pieces of news, and leveraging only 10 human evaluators to assess the performance of humans and compare it with various LLM-based automated detectors. Due to this, I am wondering how robust and generalizable the presented results are. At the same time, the paper does not discuss whether the presented results and differences between human-written and LLM-generated misinformation are statistically significant. That is, the paper simply presents the results and differences without providing any additional context of how statistically significant the results. I suggest to the authors to consider expanding their evaluation and discussing the statistical significance of these results.\n\nSecond, the paper lacks important details on how the ten human evaluators are selected. Do these evaluators have previous experience with annotating piece of information as misinformation or not? Do you take any steps to ensure that the annotations are of high quality and that the annotators did not use LLM to solve the task? For instance, the paper by Veselovsky et al. [1] demonstrated that crowd workers are using LLMs to solve tasks, so I am wondering if the paper took any steps to ensure that the human evaluators solved the task on their own. I think this is a crucial part of the paper as many results rely on the quality of these annotations and more details can shed light into these concerns. Finally, it is unclear to me why the paper studies the performance of the human evaluations on a per evaluator basis rather than taking the majority agreement of the evaluators per piece of information and then reporting the results on aggregate. Also, I suggest to the authors to include the inter-annotator agreement of the evaluators so that we can assess how difficult was the presented task for them. \n\nFinally, from the paper, it\u2019s unclear how the attack rates in Section 3 are calculated. Are these based on manual evaluations from the authors? I suggest to the authors to provide more details on how the annotated the generated pieces of information, how many people annotated each piece, etc.\n\nReference: \n\n[1] Veselovsky, V., Ribeiro, M.H. and West, R., 2023.

Due to this, I am wondering how robust and generalizable the presented results are. \n\n\nWe conduct a much more extensive investigation on misinformation generated by ChatGPT, Llama-7b-chat-generated misinformation (or 13b, 70b) and Vicuna-7b-generated misinformation (or 13b, 33b) to further validate our findings. For each LLM as the misinformation generator, we compare the detection difficulty of different misinformation generation methods including Paraphrase Generation, Rewriting Generation, Open-ended Generation and human-written misinformation. We include multiple human-written misinformation datasets including Politifact, Gossipcop and CoAID. The results are in Appendix A.\n\nWe will expand the human evaluation part in our future work.\n\n2.

That is, the paper simply presents the results and differences without providing any additional context of how statistically significant the results.

Do these evaluators have previous experience with annotating piece of information as misinformation or not?\n\nWe do not require the annotating experience. We ask evaluators to select a label of \u201cfactual\u201d or \u201cnonfactual\u201d for each news item only based on their own first perceptions upon reading it. For each evaluator, the news articles are presented in a random order.\n\n4.

I think this is a crucial part of the paper as many results rely on the quality of these annotations and more details can shed light into these concerns.\n\nYes. We take some measures such as recording the annotating process to prevent the use of LLMs.\n\n5. Finally, it is unclear to me why the paper studies the performance of the human evaluations on a per evaluator basis rather than taking the majority agreement of the evaluators per piece of information and then reporting the results on aggregate.\n\nHere we aim to compare the detection difficulty of LLM-generated misinformation & human-written misinformation. Thus, we need to control the human evaluators the same for both LLM-generated misinformation & human-written misinformation.\n\n6.

I suggest to the authors to provide more details on how the annotated the generated pieces of information, how many people annotated each piece, etc.\n\nYes. We manually verify them. We will make it more clear in the revision.\n\nWe hope we have addressed all your concerns. Thanks."

Extensive experiments suggested that compared to human-written misinformation, LLM-generated misinformation is more deceptive and potentially more harmful."

First, it is difficult to obtain factuality supervision labels to train detectors for LLM-generated misinformation since it is harder for humans to detect than human-written misinformation (Section 5). Second, malicious users can easily utilize methods shown in Table 1 and close-sourced LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) or open-sourced LLMs (e.g., Llama2) to generate misinformation at scale in different domains, types, and errors, which is hard for conventional supervisedly trained detectors to maintain effective. (2) **Zero-shot Detectors can better reflect the intrinsic detection difficulty of  LLM-generated misinformation compared with human-written misinformation.** Conventional supervisedly trained detectors (such as BERT in the pre-LLM era) are strongly influenced by the labeled training set construction and cannot reflect the detection difficulty of test set well. For example, various factors in  the labeled training set construction (including adopting human-written or LLM-generated misinformation or their combination as the training set, mixing the misinformation data with different factual information data, the domains of training set, the percentage of misinformation data in the training set) can lead to completely different detection performances of human-written or LLM-generated misinformation test set. Zero-shot Detectors, which do not need labeled training set, can better reflect the intrinsic detection difficulty of human-written or LLM-generated misinformation test set. (3) **Zero-shot LLM detectors (e.g., GPT-4) are already almost the state-of-the-art misinformation detectors.** There are already many works that have shown directly prompting LLMs such as GPT-4 in a zero-shot way can outperform conventional supervisedly trained models such as BERT on detecting human-written misinformation [1,2,3,4,5]\n\nThus, we adopt ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama2 with standard prompting and Chain-of-thought Prompting strategies as the **representative detectors** to evaluate the detection difficulty of LLM-generated misinformation data and also compare it with human-written misinformation data.\n\n[1] A Multitask, Multi-lingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023\n \n[2] Towards Reliable Misinformation Mitigation: Generalization, Uncertainty, and GPT-4 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14928\n \n[3] Interpretable Unified Language Checking https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03728 \n\n[4] Fact-Checking Complex Claims with Program-Guided Reasoning ACL 2023 https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.386/\n \n[5] Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-3 in Detecting False Political Statements: A Case Study on the LIAR Dataset https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08190 \n\n3.

Cencern1: The study is relatively small number of evaluators and only evaluates a limited number of LLM-generated news items. This means that the findings of the study may not be generalizable to all LLM-generated news items.\n\nWe conduct a much more extensive investigation on misinformation generated by ChatGPT, Llama-7b-chat-generated misinformation (or 13b, 70b) and Vicuna-7b-generated misinformation (or 13b, 33b) to further validate our findings. For each LLM as the misinformation generator, we compare the detection difficulty of different misinformation generation methods including Paraphrase Generation, Rewriting Generation, Open-ended Generation and human-written misinformation. We include multiple human-written misinformation datasets including Politifact, Gossipcop and CoAID. The results are in Appendix A.\n\n2. Concern 2: The study does not evaluate the effectiveness of different detection methods for LLM-generated misinformation. This means that it is not clear how well existing detection methods would perform at detecting the LLM-generated news items used in the study.\n\nWe would like to explain why we adopt the zero-shot LLM detectors (e.g., GPT-4) to evaluate the detection difficulty of LLM-generated misinformation: (1) **The zero-shot setting can better reflect the real-world scenarios of detecting LLM-generated misinformation.** Conventional supervisedly trained detectors  (such as BERT in the pre-LLM era) are likely to be impractical to detect LLM-generated misinformation in the practices for the following two reasons. First, it is difficult to obtain factuality supervision labels to train detectors for LLM-generated misinformation since it is harder for humans to detect than human-written misinformation (Section 5). Second, malicious users can easily utilize methods shown in Table 1 and close-sourced LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) or open-sourced LLMs (e.g., Llama2) to generate misinformation at scale in different domains, types, and errors, which is hard for conventional supervisedly trained detectors to maintain effective. (2) **Zero-shot Detectors can better reflect the intrinsic detection difficulty of  LLM-generated misinformation compared with human-written misinformation.** Conventional supervisedly trained detectors (such as BERT in the pre-LLM era) are strongly influenced by the labeled training set construction and cannot reflect the detection difficulty of test set well. For example, various factors in  the labeled training set construction (including adopting human-written or LLM-generated misinformation or their combination as the training set, mixing the misinformation data with different factual information data, the domains of training set, the percentage of misinformation data in the training set) can lead to completely different detection performances of human-written or LLM-generated misinformation test set. Zero-shot Detectors, which do not need labeled training set, can better reflect the intrinsic detection difficulty of human-written or LLM-generated misinformation test set. (3) **Zero-shot LLM detectors (e.g., GPT-4) are already almost the state-of-the-art misinformation detectors.** There are already many works that have shown directly prompting LLMs such as GPT-4 in a zero-shot way can outperform conventional supervisedly trained models such as BERT on detecting human-written misinformation [1,2,3,4,5]. \n\nThus, we adopt ChatGPT-3.5, GPT-4 and Llama2 with standard prompting and Chain-of-thought Prompting strategies as the **representative detectors** to evaluate the detection difficulty of LLM-generated misinformation data and also compare it with human-written misinformation data.\n\n[1] A Multitask, Multi-lingual, Multimodal Evaluation of ChatGPT on Reasoning, Hallucination, and Interactivity. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04023\n \n[2] Towards Reliable Misinformation Mitigation: Generalization, Uncertainty, and GPT-4 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14928\n \n[3] Interpretable Unified Language Checking https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03728 \n\n[4] Fact-Checking Complex Claims with Program-Guided Reasoning ACL 2023 https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.386/\n \n[5] Assessing the Effectiveness of GPT-3 in Detecting False Political Statements: A Case Study on the LIAR Dataset https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08190 \n\n\nWe hope we have addressed all your concerns.

                        "value": "2. Overall the paper is a comprehensive study on LLM generated misinformation and related techniques, but found it to be lacking in making a significant/original innovation.\n\nWe would like to emphasize the major contributions summarized in the introduction part as follows: \n\n> 1. We build the first taxonomy by types, domains, sources, intents and errors to characterize LLM- generated misinformation as an emerging research topic.\n> 2. We are the first to categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs including Hallucination Generation, Arbitrary Misinformation Generation and Controllable Misinformation Generation.\n> 3. We discover that misinformation generated by LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) can be harder for humans and detectors to detect than human-written misinformation with the same semantic information, which provides empirical evidence to demonstrate that LLM-generated misinformation can be more deceptive and potentially cause more harm.\n> 4. We discuss the emerging challenges for misinformation detectors (Section 6), implications of our discovery on combating misinformation in the age of LLMs (Section 7) and the countermeasures through LLMs\u2019 lifecycle (Section 8).\n\nAnd our non-trivial discovery \u201cLLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics\" have multiple important implications for combating misinformation in the age of LLMs (in Section 7).\n\n> 1. LLM-generated misinformation can be more deceptive and potentially cause more harm.\n> 2. There is a potential major paradigm shift of misinformation production from humans to LLMs.\n> 3. Collective efforts on combating LLM-generated misinformation from different stakeholders are needed.\n\n3. The paper often uses Appendix sections to support the claims made which makes it less readable and less self-contained. The paper establishes what 'detectors' are, rather late.\n\nWe will improve on these aspects in our future revision.\n\n4. \"against HC method\" in section 3, page 4, is it supposed to be HG? spelling mistake in word 'Appendx' in section 4\n\nWe have revised the typos.\n\nWe hope we have addressed all your concerns. Thanks."
