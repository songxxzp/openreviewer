Subcluster aggregation is performed by first computing a similarity measure between pairs of subclusters that measures how the extension of  the first cluster creates overlap with the second cluster. The similarity matrix is then employed by the Walk Likelihood Community Finder algorithm (WLCF) that essentially provides the final clusters."

The method depends on hyperparameters: initial number of clusters k and and parameter r that establishes the neighborhood of each subcluster.\n\t\nWe have added a detailed analysis on the effects of the parameter r. Additionally, While it's acknowledged that the VillageNet clustering method depends on the initial performance of K-Means clustering, we emphasize that our primary goal is not to cluster the data effectively into k villages. Instead, we use K-Means to form a network of villages, leveraging the information from this clustering to achieve the final results. Specifically, choosing k such that k\u226bm ensures meaningful clustering.\n\n2.      It is not clear whether the method estimates the final number of clusters or the number of clusters is given as input to the method.\nOur method estimates the number of clusters.\n\n3.     Experimental part is weak and could be improved (see questions below).\n\t\nWe address this below. \n\nQuestions:\n1.       If the method estimates the number of clusters, then results should be provided on how close are the estimations to the actual values.\n\nWe agree and have demonstrated this using a number of metrics, specifically NMI, adjusted RAND, among others. \n\n2.    Since the similarity matrix is computed, typical agglomerative approaches (eg. single linkage) or spectral clustering methods could have been used instead of the WLCF algorithm. What is the advantage of WLCF?\nWLCF is shown to be better than state of the art algorithms like Louvain's algorithm. Plus unlike spectral clustering, it does not need the number of communities as an input, instead the number of communities is given as an output.\n\n3.     Several approaches based on overclustering and cluster aggregation have been proposed. Some of them could have been used in the experimental study.\n\t\nWe agree and have included a comparison to the BIRCH algorithm, which does overclustering and cluster aggregation.\n\n4.      A  short presentation of the WLCF method should be included. Does this method contain hyperparameters? What is the theoretical complexity (not the empirical complexity) of the method?\nIn the revised version, a more detailed explanation of WLCF is included. The theoretical complexity of WLCF has not been calculated in the paper.\n\n5.     The number of attributes in Pendigits dataset is not 64 but 16.\nWe used the sklearn version of digits. It has 64 (8X8) parameters\n\n6.     Experiments using additional datasets could have been be included to draw more reliable conclusions on the performance of the method.\nThe revised version contains this."

The idea of over-clustering + merging is not new, which can be find in many previous methods, like BIRCH.\n\t\nWe have expanded the discussion to include the broader contribution of our paper. We have also included a comparison to other methods, such as BIRCH.\n\n2.       The proposed method is a combination of different techniques, but it is not clear why this combination is unique and which specific unsolved problem it can handle.\n\nWe have explicitly provided a more detailed explanation of what makes Village-Net innovative, emphasizing its fast clustering capabilities for complex data.\n\n3.      The comparison methods are weak, only K-means and DBSCAN.\n\nWe have added more comparison methods that are unsupervised and computationally feasible. \n\n4.     The performance of the proposed method strongly depend on K-means and hyper-parameters.\n\n\tWhile it's acknowledged that the VillageNet clustering method depends on the initial performance of K-Means clustering, we emphasize that our primary goal is not to cluster the data effectively into k villages. Instead, we use K-Means to form a network of villages, leveraging the information from this clustering to achieve the final results. Specifically, choosing k such that k\u226bm ensures meaningful clustering. We also include a detailed analysis of the key hyperparameters."

To achieve optimal clustering, the network is clustered using the Walk-likelihood Community Finder (WLCF) algorithm.

This assumption may not hold suit for most datasets, leading to inaccurate clustering results.\n3. Lack of More Experimental Validation: The algorithm was only compared with a few traditional clustering algorithms, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well only on two datasets. Therefore, it is difficult to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive performance.\n4. The evaluation metrics for the experimental results are too narrow.

WLCF is one of the crucial steps in the algorithm. However, the author's description of WLCF is not sufficiently clear. Additionally, during the experimental process, I would like to see some ablation experiments to verify the impact of each step in the algorithm on the final clustering results.\n4.

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer CGbY, \nWe appreciate your valuable feedback and have made substantial revisions to address the weaknesses and concerns highlighted in your review. Here is a detailed response to each point:\n \nWeakness\n1.     \tDependency on K-Means Clustering: The first step of the VillageNet clustering method involves using the K-Means clustering algorithm to create initial \"villages.\" Therefore, the performance and results of K-Means clustering have a certain dependency.\n \nWhile it's acknowledged that the VillageNet clustering method depends on the initial performance of K-Means clustering, we emphasize that our primary goal is not to cluster the data effectively into k villages. Instead, we use K-Means to form a network of villages, leveraging the information from this clustering to achieve the final results. Specifically, choosing k such that k\u226bm ensures meaningful clustering.\n \n \n2.     \tAssumption about Data Distribution: VillageNet clustering assumes the presence of some local clustering structures within the dataset, and that these local structures can be successfully separated by the K-Means clustering algorithm. This assumption may not hold suit for most datasets, leading to inaccurate clustering results.\n \nWe acknowledge the assumption about local clustering structures and the dependence on K-Means. We've clarified that Village-Net performs well on large datasets where finding the neighborhood of each instance is computationally expensive, and local structures can be effectively separated by K-Means clustering.\n \n3.     \tLack of More Experimental Validation: The algorithm was only compared with a few traditional clustering algorithms, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm performs well only on two datasets. Therefore, it is difficult to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive performance.\n \nWe've performed additional experiments and comparisons with more clustering algorithms in the revised version. However, obtaining comparisons with certain new clustering algorithms is challenging due to unavailability or impractical implementation on large datasets.\n \n4.     \tThe evaluation metrics for the experimental results are too narrow. The author solely relies on NMI as the sole measure.\n \nIn response to your suggestion, we've expanded the set of evaluation metrics in the revised version to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed algorithm's performance.\n \nQuestions:\n1.     \tI consider Equation 5 is the distance calculation formula that the author has redefined between villages. I would like the author to clarify whether this calculation method satisfies the conditions for distance definition.\nWe would like to clarify that Equation 5 is specifically designed for determining the edge-weight between two villages, rather than representing the distance. It's important to note that the concept of edge-weight operates inversely to distance: a higher edge-weight signifies closer proximity between villages, contrary to the typical understanding of distances.\n \n2.     \tThe experimental section lacks an analysis of the hyperparameter \"r\".\n \nIn the new version, we've included a detailed analysis of the hyperparameter \"r\" to provide a better understanding of its impact on the algorithm and clustering results.\n \n3.     \tWLCF is one of the crucial steps in the algorithm. However, the author's description of WLCF is not sufficiently clear. Additionally, during the experimental process, I would like to see some ablation experiments to verify the impact of each step in the algorithm on the final clustering results.\n \nWe've enhanced the clarity of the description of WLCF in response to your feedback. Additionally, we acknowledge the importance of ablation experiments and will consider incorporating them in future work.\n \n4.     \tI suggest that the author perform visual analysis on some artificial non- convex datasets (such as Two Moon, Flower, etc.) and visualize each step of the algorithm to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n \nTo illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we've included visualizations of key steps on an artificial dataset in Fig 2."
