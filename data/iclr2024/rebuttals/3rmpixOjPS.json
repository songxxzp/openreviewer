                        "value": "Thanks for your recognition and valuable comments. We respond to your questions about the comparison with VanillaNet, linear ensemble description, and experimental settings in the following. We hope these answers can address all your concerns.\n\n**1. The way of merging a stack of linear layers with BN has already been studied by [1]. [1] VanillaNet: the Power of Minimalism in Deep Learning.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the question. VanillaNet is a great lightweight network that also merges BN and 1x1 Conv (i.e., linear layer) after training for fast inference. Both VanillaNet and our TDRL demonstrate the potential of linear ensemble structure for representation learning. However, the motivation and design of these two methods are different. VanillaNet stacks convolutions and BN like VGG and replaces the commonly used 3x3 kernel with 1x1 to reduce the computational complexity. After training, it merges 1x1 convolutions with BN to speed up the inference speed. In contrast, we want to improve the performance of existing lightweight ViTs. Therefore, we propose to introduce nonlinearity to linear layers by stacking multiple linear layers with BN to improve its representation ability. Furthermore, we propose a pyramid multiple-branch structure to improve both the representation ability and representation diversity. In addition, we analyze the potential training instability issues from both theoretical and experimental perspectives when applying our TDRL in ViTs, and propose a simple and efficient way to solve it. Experiments in Table 1,2,3 show that our proposed TDRL can improve the performance of various lightweight models on different tasks. \n\n**2. You mentioned several times that BN can be used in between layers for nonlinearity, and the proposed re-parameterization method is nonlinear. Why does BN have nonlinearity? Isn't the proposed method a linear ensemble re-parameterization structure?**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for your comments. In this paper, we write \"nonlinear ensemble into linear layers by expanding the depth of the linear layers with batch normalization\" in the abstract and the similar introductions in Section 3.2 because though the operation of BN is linear, the mean and variance in BN are calculated by the current features, can not be merged with the adjacent linear layers during training. Thus, we claim that the overall combination is somehow can be regarded as a \"nonlinear module\". We have updated our revision to make the statement more rigorous.\n\n**3. Why is the experimental setting based on MIM? What is the performance of training ViT with the proposed method on ImageNet directly? What is the performance of training vanilla ViT with MIM?**\n\n**Answers:** Due to that the recent SOTA methods (e.g., G2SD and MAE-Lite) adopt MIM pretraining for taking full advantage of self-supervised learning, we mainly perform experiments based on these pipelines for a fair comparison. Without MIM, we compare the ViT-Tiny models trained on ImageNet directly for 100 epochs and find that our TDRL still achieves better accuracy than the original ViT-Tiny (65.86% vs. 63.47%). We have added this comparison in Section B.4. In Table 1, MAE-Ti is the vanilla ViT-Tiny model with MIM pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. It achieves 75.2% accuracy in ImageNet which is lower than some CNNs or hybrid architectures listed in Table 1."

                    "value": "This paper proposes a reparameterization technique to improve performance of lightweight vanilla ViT. The reparameterization technique is used in CNNs but surprisingly unexplored in ViTs. The paper presents a linear-based re-parameterization for vanilla Vision Transformers, without any convolutional operations. The authors introduce a specific linear stack with batch normalization for added nonlinearity and a pyramid multi-branch structure for feature fusion. They also highlight the importance of distribution consistency in deep networks, especially for ViTs, and introduce a Two-Dimensional Re-parameterized Linear module (TDRL) to address this. To enhance re-parameterization, different depths of linear stacks are used to create a pyramid multi-branch structure. Since this multi-branch structure can lead to instability in training,  authors suggest 1) an additional batch normalization to modulate the distributions of Q and K in the attention mechanism to rectify the distribution changes. 2) For other components like Feed Forward Networks (FFN), where the variance change isn't as drastic as in attention calculation, features are re-scaled using the square root of N instead of being normalized."

                        "value": "Thanks for your high recognition and valuable comments. In the following, we provide some additional results and discussion about Swin-tiny-TDRL, overfitting issues, and computational complexity.\n\n**1. The authors experiment on the vanilla ViT-Tiny model. It is not clear what would be the impact of this TDRL module if applied in other tiny transformers such as Swin-tiny etc.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the question. The model parameter of Swin-Tiny is 28M, larger than the tiny models (e.g., ViT-Tiny with 6M parameters, and MobileOne-S0 with 2M parameters) used in the paper. So, we don't conduct experiments on it before. When applying TDRL in the FFN components of the Swin-tiny model, we find that the accuracy increases from 76.2% to 78.2% under 100 training epochs, indicating the superiority of TDRL. We have added this comparison in Table 3.\n\n**2. The introduction of multiple branches and added nonlinearity might lead to overfitting, especially on smaller datasets. I don't see the authors discussing anything around it.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the question. Actually, we have not observed overfitting issues in our experiments whose reasons may be as follows: 1) The datasets we used are relatively big for ViT-Tiny, even with our proposed TDRL; 2) Batch normalization in TDRL not only provides nonlinearity during training but also reduces the risk of overfitting; 3) The feature dimension along the network is not changed (features are limited to the original dimension before outputting from TDRL), resulting in the unchanged intrinsic dimension. This also reduces the risk of overfitting compared to directly increasing the depth of the network or the feature dimension. We conduct additional comparison experiments on small cifar10 datasets and find that our TDRL can still improve the performance of ViT-Tiny (70.9% vs. 69.9% for 100 epochs). Of course, when the size of datasets is small for the used network, we may face overfitting issues. However, considering the rapid development of data size and our lightweight model research targets, the probability of overfitting in practical applications is very low. We have added this discussion in Section B.8.\n\n**3. Can you discuss on the computational complexity of the TDRL architecture?**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks. We have added this in Table 8. As for the default settings of TDRL (i.e., P-W2S), the additional FLOPs compared to a single linear is around 5 times. As a result, the whole FLOPs of TDRL is 9.7G, much larger than that of ViT-Tiny (1.3G). Although TDRL increases the computational cost in training, it can be combined for inference without incurring additional costs compared to the original model. In addition, as mentioned in section B.4, we can reduce the overall training costs and computational complexity by reducing the number of replaced linear layers and changing the configuration of TDRL. And experiments demonstrate that under similar training costs, our TDRL still outperforms the vanilla ViT-Tiny."

This is important, particularly for the tiny models, because pure ViTs lag behind the ConvNets and hybrid models due to the lack of inductive bias and inadequate capacity. Reparametrization, training with extra parameters but shrinking back at the inference stage, is a good way to fit more knowledge into the models without incurring extra inference costs.\n\n2. TDRL seems to be a generic method and can be applied to many architectures, e.g., VanillaNet, and different tasks, e.g., DDPM, with linear layers.\n\n3. With the help of varied-depth branches and feature rectification, TDRL achieves promising results on classification and dense prediction tasks, especially the latter."

                        "value": "Thank you for your high recognition of our work and valuable comments. Our detailed responses are as follows:\n\n**1. All the experiments are conducted with tiny or small models and a few pre-training epochs. I am curious whether TDRL would still be beneficial for larger models and when using larger epochs, since reparametrization works for ConvNets with various capacities. This might further strengthen the paper.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for your valuable comments. We conduct our main experiments with tiny models because our motivation is to boost the performance of lightweight ViTs. To further show its potential for larger models, we apply our TDRL on DeiT-B for 100 training epochs. DeiT-B-TDRL achieves 76.2% accuracy, improving the accuracy of DeiT-B by 0.6%. As for long epochs, we find that our classification accuracy can increase from 78.6% to 79.9% by increasing finetuning epochs from 200 to 1,000. It demonstrates that our TDRL can be beneficial for larger epochs. We have added these comparisons in Section B.5. Due to the limitation of GPUs (e.g., 16 V100 GPUs), we have to spend more time training larger models for larger epochs. For example, we spent around 4 days training TDRL-based DeiT-B for 100 epochs. Thus, we may not be able to provide the results of large models (e.g., DeiT-B) for larger epochs (e.g., 300 epochs) during the author response period. We will add more results in Section B.5.\n\n**2. I noticed that the gain from TDRL is considerably larger on dense prediction tasks. Do the authors have any explanation for it? Is it due to the use of BN in TDRL since some dense prediction tasks favor architectures with BN? If so, can the authors isolate the contributions of reparametrization and BN?**\n\n**Answers:** In our opinion, this may be due to the difficulty of the task. Due to that the dense prediction tasks are more difficult than image classification, the benefits of improving training representation ability through TDRL may be greater. As for BN, it's the core of nonlinearity in TDRL. Without BN, a module composed of multiple linear layers can be equivalent to a single linear layer during training and cannot bring any gain. In the experiment, we observed that when BN was removed from TDRL, its classification accuracy was almost the same as baseline, indicating that a linear re-parameterization structure cannot bring gain. Of course, If there are only BN without heavy parameter structures, ViTs will almost consist of normalization layers and activation layers. Intuitively, this can cause the network to almost lose its classification ability. Thus, isolating the contributions of reparametrization and BN may not be appropriate. We have provided more analysis in Section 4.2.\n\n**3. Certain parts of the presentation could be further improved. For example, Fig. 1c does not help grasp how to do intra/inter-branch merging.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the comment. The entire merging process is obtained through formula derivation (Equation (1), (2), (3)), and it is not easy to provide specific details in Figure 1c. Therefore, we provide the formula numbers involved in each process in Figure 1c to help readers quickly find the corresponding content and understand the entire merging process. We also update the caption of Figure 1 to clarify the target of each merging process."

Comparing the baseline with or without BN would also make it somewhat clearer regarding the pure gain from the reparametrization.\n\nDespite this concern, I still tend to maintain my original score given the overall strengths of this work."

                        "value": "Thanks for your recognition and valuable comments. In the following, we provide a detailed description of our motivation and the comparison of D-MAE-Lite. We hope our response can address your concerns.\n\n**1. To some extent, this paper lacks novelty. The intra-branch fusion and inter-branch fusion are commonly seen techniques in the re-parameterization of CNN networks, as shown in Sec 3.1. This paper only applies this technique to ViTs. Although the targeted module is changed from convolutions to linear projections, this modification is straightforward. This paper uses an additional batch normalization to modulate Q^{'} and K^{'} and names this operation a distribution rectification operation. This operation is quite simple.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for your question. Our motivation is to improve the performance of lightweight vanilla ViT networks through re-parameterization. However, as shown in Table 10, directly applying the recent CNN-based re-parameterization by replacing KxK convolutions with linear projection can not bring efficient improvements. Thus, we propose a nonlinear ensemble, an efficient way to improve the training representation ability by stacking multiple linear layers with batch normalization. We further design a pyramid multi-branch architecture to merge multiple diverse feature representations. In addition, we analyze the potential training instability issues when adopting this multi-branch module to transformers from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Experiments in Figure 1 show the efficiency of our distribution rectification operation. In summary, although the proposed TDRL is not complex, it can be simply and flexibly adopted in different linear layers in various networks for various tasks (including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and image generation) to improve the performance (shown in Tables 1, 2, 3). \n\n**2. In Table 1, TDRL only outperforms D-MAE-Lite for 0.3 (78.7 vs. 78.4). The advantage does seem not significant.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the question. D-MAE-Lite is a recent SOTA method that focuses on improving the performance of ViT-Tiny, especially for image classification. D-MAE-Lite is pretrained for 400 epochs whose training epoch is larger than ours. When pretrained with 400 epochs, our TDRL outperforms D-MAE-Lite by 0.5%. Considering that the performance difference of some recent methods (e.g., MAE-Ti vs. TinyMIM-Ti and MAE-Lite vs. D-MAE-Lite) on the ImageNet dataset (in Table 1), we believe that this improvement is relatively significant and can demonstrate the superiority of our TDRL."

                        "value": "Thanks for your time and questions. We hope that our responses can address all your questions and concerns and receive your recognition.\n\n**1. What about the different\u00a0$L_N$\u00a0in every rep-branch in the P-WNS? And there is only 1\u00d71 (without K\u00d7K) in linear projection, the accuracy gaps in different configurations of \"pyramid multi-branch topology\" seems minor (Figure 2a).**\n\n**Answers:** $L_N$ denotes the number of basic units (one linear layer with batch normalization) in the rep-branch under N branch re-parameterization. In our pyramid structure, $L_n$ is set to n for n-th rep-branch. Formulaically, $L_n=n, n=1,2,...,N$. We have defined the number of $L_N$ in Equation 6 and in the caption of Figure 1. As mentioned in the introduction, we focus on improving the performance of vanilla lightweight ViTs to achieve uniformity superiority of ViTs across different model scales. Considering that ViTs are non-convolution architectures without KxK convolutions, we thereby design our pyramid multiple re-parameterization architecture to enhance the training representation ability of linear layer, not use KxK convolutions. The results in Figure 2a are not used to show the accuracy gaps in different pyramid multi-branch topologies. Here, we show the importance of the skip branch in the three configurations of the regular version (i.e., P-DLWN), and find that all variants suffer from non-negligible performance degradation (larger than 0.8%) without a skip branch. As for the configurations of P-WNS, we compare their accuracy gaps and model size in Figure 2b. Considering both the accuracy and model size, we chose P-W2S as the default setting.\n\n**2. Why the proposed TDRL should be combined with distillation? Why not use a stronger and simpler baseline such as DeiT-B (can obtain 81.8 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet)?**\n\n**Answers:** In fact, the proposed TDRL does not rely on distillation or MIM pretraining. Due to that the recent SOTA methods (e.g., G2SD and MAE-Lite) adopt distillation and MIM pretraining for taking full advantage of large pre-trained models and self-supervised learning, we perform most experiments under these settings for a fair comparison. When directly training the ViT-Tiny model on ImageNet without MIM pretraining for 100 epochs, our TDRL boosts the performance of ViT-Tiny from 63.47% to 65.86%. It also demonstrates the superiority of our proposed TDRL without distillation and MIM pretraining. As mentioned in the introduction, recent large ViTs have achieved promising performance compared to CNNs, but the performance of vanilla lightweight ViTs is still far from satisfactory compared to that of recent lightweight CNNs or hybrid networks, hindering the uniformity of ViTs across different model scales. Thus, we aim to improve the performance of vanilla lightweight ViTs and not use DeiT-B as the baseline. Also, we find that applying our TDRL on the DeiT-B model can consistently improve the accuracy under 100 training epochs (76.2% vs. 75.6%). \n\n**3. In Sec 3.2, the authors claim that \"The linear operation in transformers focuses more on intra-token semantic mining rather than inter-token spatial exploration. Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks.\" I think the authors should explain this in more details. I am confused why Linear stacking is inherently appropriate to transformer networks.**\n\n**Answers:** Thanks for the question. Generally speaking, linear stacking with nonlinearity (batch normalization) is similar to the MLP structure. Since MLP has been proven to be appropriate to transformer networks and plays an important role in learning intra-token representations[1][2][3], we claim that this type of linear stacking is also inherently appropriate to transformer networks. More explanations are as follows: \n\n1) Linear stacking with batch normalization can be regarded as a non-linear operation in the training stage. In the training stage, this type of rep-branch is somehow similar to the MLP structure in transformers. The differences are: 1) MLP introduces nonlinearity through GeLU, and we implement it through batch normalization; 2) MLP only consists of two linear layers, while our rep-branch contains several linear layers.\n\n2) MLP  plays an important role in transformer networks to represent rich intra-token information. Many transformers[1][2] have demonstrated the importance of MLP. And another type of network family, namely MLP-Mixer[3], also shows that MLP is very important and MLP-only networks can also achieve promising performance.\n\nThus, we claim that linear stacking (with batch normalization) is appropriate for ViTs.  In Table 1 and Table 2, we demonstrate that applying our proposed TDRL can improve the performance of transformer networks. We have made our expression clearer in Section 3.2.\n\n[1].

I don't aggre with the claim that \"Linear stacking with batch normalization can be regarded as a non-linear operation in the training stage,\" mathematically, these operations are inherently linear. Therefore, I suggest a more comprehensive exploration of the results, especially when considering a \"stronger and simpler baseline such as DeiT-B (achieving 81.8 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet).\"\n\nWhile the improvement on main papers and \"100 training epochs (76.2% vs. 75.6%)\" is duly recognized, I am curious about the performance in a more robust setting, specifically with 300 epochs and auto-augmentation. In my own reimplementation of your method, I observed no gains in such conditions.\n\nFor me, the most intriguing aspect lies in understanding the reasons behind the efficacy of this approach in low baseline scenarios where high baselines might not yield significant improvements. If these insights are substantial, it could elevate the significance of your work beyond showcasing its effectiveness solely in low baseline scenarios, making it more impactful for the vision community. \n\nI also respect the scores provided by other reviewers. But I will keep my score for now."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer HAf5, \n\nThanks for your kind reply. Our responses are as follows:\n\n**1. Non-linearity of linear stacking with batch normalizations.**\n\n **Answer:**  Thanks for your comments. In the previous response, we mentioned \"Linear stacking with batch normalization can be regarded as a non-linear operation in the training stage\" because though the operation of BN is linear, the mean and variance in BN are calculated by the current batch features, can not be merged with the adjacent linear layers during training. Thus, we claim that the overall combination is somehow can be regarded as a \"nonlinear module\". Still, this linear stacking is similar to MLP and is appropriate to transformer networks. We also have updated our revision to make the statement more rigorous.\n\n**2. Results on DeiT-B, robust setting, and reimplementation**\n\n**Answer:**  As mentioned in the abstract, we aim to improve the performance of lightweight ViTs. Therefore, our experiments are mostly conducted based on tiny ViTs to investigate whether the proposed method can help boost the performance of lightweight ViTs. \n\nAs for the experimental settings, we use official codes like MAE and DeiT, which contain widely used augmentation technologies and training strategies, and we also train the model for 300 epochs (In Table 1). Thus, we believe that our results are obtained in a robust setting.\n\nAs for DeiT-B, we use the official code and only use TDRL in Q/K/V for efficiency. We follow the default settings of DeiT-B and only reduce the epoch to 100 due to the training cost and limited time. It still shows the superiority of our TDRL. \n\nAs for your reproduction question, could you please provide the training details? Different configurations may lead to very different results. According to the experiment in the paper, the re-parameterization module is not necessarily as large as possible. A larger heavy parameter configuration may increase the difficulty of learning and require changes in the training configuration.\n\nDue to that, the rebuttal stage is drawing to a close, and with our limitations of GPUs, we may not be able to provide the results for 300 epochs right now. But we will add more results in Section B.5 once it's done. We have updated the code for DeiT, you can run the train.sh to train the ViT-Base model.\n\nSincerely, \u2028Authors"
