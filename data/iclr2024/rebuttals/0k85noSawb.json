Alternatively, some preliminary knowledge ought to be presented before the concrete introduction of the proposed method, such as the concrete formulation of invariance criterion $\\ell_{\\rm inv}$, to make the full paper more complete.

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. The authors claim that pre-training phase undermines feature transferability by prioritizing features that minimize the pre-training loss. Although some references are provided, it is still not very intuitive to readers. More simple yet typical illustrations will facilitate to convince the motivation of this paper. In addition, some concrete explanation of why pre-training tends to select such features will also help.\n2. At the beginning of paper, authors claim the poor feature transferability problem resulted from exsiting in pre-training phase since the model tends to prioritize the features that minimize the loss. Then discuss that some concrete cases regarding this, such as gradient starvation and neural collapse problem. What are the relationships between the aforementioned problem and latter two problems? Why they result in prioritizing features that minimize the loss? Does the phenomenon in SSL that output identical and constant featrues belong to this case? If so, why you think that it is the model 'focus on' some specific features and what are the characteristics of these features? I think that such statement is far-fetched and requires more careful definition.\n3. As mentioned in Related Works section, variance term helps learn a wide range of features, but why it intutively learns the unique, non-redundant information (Page 4)?\n4. I do not think that experimental results in Appendix A are convincing. My concerns mainly include three aspects: \n    - (1) First of all, when applying VCReg to all blocks, what does the training loss look like? Are all VCReg added or averaged? \n    - (2) Secondly, why different $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is set? Why not use the same $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for fairness?\n    - (3) Since the training time is limited to 90 epochs, it exists the case that the model does not converge. For example, Flowers dataset is simple datasets and may converge fast while DTD dataset is difficult and requires more time for model to converge. If results of converged model and not converaged model are compared, it is unfair.\n5. Due to Question 4, I further don't believe that the motivation of applying VCReg to intermediate layers is strong and convincing.\n6. What are the evidence/references or empirical results for the statement \"Regularizing intermediate layers enable the model to capture more complex, higher-level ...... model's generalization capabilities. Furthermore, it fosters the development of feature hierarchies ...... improved transfer learning performance\"? Four concerns are included here:\n    - The statement is not intuitive. \n    - Besides, in general, it is widely believed that intermediate layers produce relatively low level features compared with the final output. Why do you think that regularization contributes to learn complex and high-level features?\n    - Why minimizing covariance helps improve the stability and generalization performance. Could you please provide some empirical results, such as learning curves, and results or references about generalization bound improvements?\n    - From my understanding, maximizing the variance aims to help network avoid identical and constant output which further helps avoid model collapse, why it can learn hierarchies and enrich latent space?\n7. What are the concrete details of operation metioned in \"Spatial Dimension\"? Could you express it in mathematical way? \n8. I am also confused with reasons and priciples behind ${\\rm SmoothL1(x)}$? What are the insights behind Eq. (7): Will the modification operation be involved in the optimization process? How does such operation affect the optimization process.\n9. I do not understand the fast implementation of VCReg in Section 3.3. Since the regularizations are calculated on the corresponding intermediate representations, when calculating gradients, they will not affect the subsequent modules. However, the modules in front of them will be affected due to the chain rules. Since gradients in this paper is calculated manually, will the gradients be modified? In fact, I can not get your operations in Algorithm 1 since this paper does not provided a systematic mathematical formulation. I am not sure Algorithm 1 is correct.\n10. Since the gradients are manually set, is the ${\\rm SmoothL1}$ operation taken into consideration?\n \nThe most important question is:  __how does the proposed method solve the problem that the pretraining phase undermines feature transferability?__ Since this paper fails to formulate this problem. I do not think this paper is sound.\n\n__With all concerns and questions mentioned above take into consideration, I do not check the experiments part because I am not sure I can evaluate the results correctly due to my concerns and questions mentioned above. If my concerns and questions are well addressed later, I will further check the experiments part during rebuttal phase.__\n\n__Some minor problems:__\n- What is the definition of $\\ell_{\\rm sup}(\\cdot, \\cdot)$?"

Paper [1] already verified that using regularization similar to covariance in Barlow Twins (without invariance) could already benefit many learning methods including SSLs and SL. Even DimCL [1] only uses (similar) covariance regularization (without invariance) for the final layer (projector) already yielded satisfactory performance and does not need to apply to many layers as the proposed method which would bring a huge computation and make it overcomplicated.\n\n+ Comparing the downstream tasks of only supervised learning methods (Table 2) might not be very meaningful because the drawback of supervised learning requires massive manual labels (ImageNet) which is prohibitively computational cost. Many SSL methods have already shown that can significantly outperform SL on downstream tasks including both classification and object detection. This makes the contribution of this paper less impactful.\n\n[1] DimCL: Dimensional Contrastive Learning for Improving Self-Supervised Learning, IEEE Access 2023."

I am wondering if the author could elaborate more on this. Is there any experimental evidence to support that VCReg can mitigate the internal covariate shift and further benefit the training? Since there is research arguing that BN does not reduce the internal covariate shift [1], I am interested in whether the VCReg can reduce it, and improve the training.\n\n3.

                    "value": "- The method, VCReg, while being generically described is missing several critical details in the paper. The idea of using VCReg on several layers instead of just the layer that outputs representation is not probably described in terms of how the layers are chosen and whether the weights were varied on a per-layer basis. A proper ablation would be very useful for both the readers and users of this method that want to test the approach in their implementations.\n\n- The authors may want to describe gradients derivation in the main paper and include full derivations of the gradients for VCRegin the appendix.  This information is key in making their method work in practice\n\n- The connection to gradient starvation is very weak at best. The paper only shows an experiment with a toy dataset that is meant to build intuition on how various methods avoid gradient starvation. On a related note, have the authors considered running spectral decoupling introduced in gradient starvation paper and compare to VCReg?\n\n- The connection to neural collapse is interesting but the empirical evidence is limited (understandably so due to compute but I feel its my duty to call this out here)\n\n- I am curious about how VCReg was applied in the SSL setting? Would VCReg essentially be VICReg with internal layers getting regularized with VCReg trick? Would using VICReg for intermediate layers make sense here?"

Have the authors considered using this approach as a baseline? If so, do they see a similar improvement to what is shown in the paper? \n\n- Please consider moving some of the writing on key aspects of the paper from the appendix to main paper\n\n- I did not quite understand what the paper means in \"Spatial Dimensions\" paragraph. Could the authors please update their explanation and/or include more details in the appendix?"
