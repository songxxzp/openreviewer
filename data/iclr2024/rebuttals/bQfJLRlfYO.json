The primary technique is to decompose a question into a set of simple questions, retrieve candidate answers for each simple question from Knowledge Base, and then select one candidate answer as the answer to a simple question, finally integrate all these simple question+answer into a text. On a number of benchmark datasets, this method reaches the SOTA performance. The authors claim the proposed method can perform better in the future."

The weaknesses and questions have been addressed below.\n\nW1: At the methodological level, this paper is within the paradigm of the art of alchemy, in which authors demonstrated professional and proficient skills. The processes of question decomposition, selection, as well as the reasoning of answers, are all black-boxes. This might answer the question why this method has not outperformed the SOTA performance.\n\nA1: We agree with your point that LLM-based models are almost all within the paradigm of the art of alchemy. However, we also need to highlight existing has already demonstrated a certain degree of interpretability and generalization. For instance, the CoT generated by question decomposition module of Keqing can be used to interpret the logic of multi-hop question answering, which can help users to understand the process of answer generation and determine whether to adopt this answer.\n\nFor the performance, we believe that our performance can be further improved with more powerful LLMs and we will included their results in our next iteration of revision.\n\nW2: A small mistake is that Authors forgot to remove the reference to the Appendix, which resulted in Appendix ?? everywhere in the text.\nA2: Thanks for pointing out this typo, we have fixed it in the updated version of the paper.\n\nQ1: In Section 4.2, there is a sentence \"we believe the performance of Keqing can be further improved with more powerful LLMs, like LLmMA-2\", and will include the results in the future. How is the related with the primary method by Question-decomposition using Knowledge bases?\n\nA1: Since our experiments finetuning LLMs to finish question decomposition, and we currently use a finetuned LLaMA-7B model to assist decompose input questions, where the results of question decomposition will heavily influence the performance of generated answers, and we believe this stage can be improved by finetuning more powerful LLMs.\n\nQ2: What if applying this method for the CoT logic reasoning? Could Keqing outperforms the SOTA level?\nA2: Actually, the decomposed sub-questions according to predefined question template can be already treated as the CoT for multi-hop question answering. And we are very willing to include comparison of CoT logic reasoning in our feature work.\n\nQ3: Can you provide one error case to illustrate the limitation of the current Keqing system?\n\nA3: Thanks for your suggestions, we have further analyzed the potential causes leading to Keqing\u2019s failure and presented three representative failure examples (decomposition failed; retrieval failed; reasoning failed) in Appendix. Please refer to Appendix E in the updated version of the paper, new added content is marked in blue."

But these intermediate steps remain black boxes.  The \"certain degree of interpretability\" are built upon these black boxes. The real challenge is not how to decompose, but how to solve these intermediate steps. CoT is only a fig leaf."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for joining the discussion!\n\nWe respectfully disagree with you that the real challenge is how to solve these intermediate steps. Since for the Knowlesge Base Question Answering (KBQA) task, even traditional methods perform well on the one-hop datasets, because one only needs to find the corresponding fact (typically a triplet ($s, r, o$)) in the given KB to answer one-hop questions. While the main challenge lies in how to solve those diffcuclt questions that requires multi-steps of reasoning, and with the decomposition module in our framework, each intermediate step becomes answering a one-hop sub-question, which is finished using LLMs in our approach. As we believe LLMs are powerful enough to automatically extract correct answers from the retrieved context for one-hop sub-questions, therefore, decomposition has turned out to be an effective strategy to solve the complex multi-hop questions for KBQA task.\n\nBest regards."

The weaknesses and questions have been addressed below.\n\nW1: Recent developments in question answering also consider utilizing graph neural network methods e.g., Question-Answer Sentence Graph for Joint Modeling Answer Selection. In Proceedings of the 17th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 968\u2013979, Dubrovnik, Croatia. Association for Computational Linguistics.\n\nA1: Thanks for notification, and we have cited this paper in our revision already.\nWe know there are a lot of outstanding KBQA framework built on Graph Neural Network or some other sophisticated networks. However, compared to the performance, the explainability and generalizability should be also considered as the metric of measuring KBQA system. Compared to traditional KBQA systems, Keqing can intuitively explain the logic of generating multi-hop answers, leading to a trustworthy LLM-based KBQA system, which is currently a popular research direction. Meanwhile, Keqing also demonstrated strong generalization abilities by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and we believe its performance can be further improved as the increase of capabilities of LLMs.\"\n\n\nW2: I have a concern regarding the novelty of the approach. This work simply uses RoBERTa-based similarity scores and DPR-based knowledge augmentation, both works which have already been proposed before. The authors need to better highlight their contributions and why they consider it original work.\n\nA2: We acknowledge that question decomposition and candidate reasoning are not fresh ideas in the Q&A domain, however, to the best of our knowledge, this is indeed the inaugural endeavor to build a pipeline integrating these functions through the magic of LLMs. With respect to novelty, we would like to emphasize that we have developed an effective framework that can automate the complete process of knowledge-based question answering with as little extra effort as possible. Note that our pipeline can be training-free with least effort by using off-the-shelf LLMs to finish question decomposition and candidate reasoning while maintaining a decent performance, although a little fine-tuning effort can lead to better performance.\nDistinct from traditional KBQA systems, \n\nIn addition, our approach also differs from those recent KBQA systems based on LLMs that typically generate one-step symbolic expressions for the query question leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, which is error-prone and lacks transparency.\n\n\nQ1: Can the authors also illustrate the runtime and memory complexity of their work, as it is highly dependent upon LLMs which incur large runtime for finetuning?\n\nA1: Thanks for your valuable advice, we have included the additional information about the runtime and memory complexity of our method in Table.8 of Appendix. \nMore details can found in Appendix D in the updated version of the paper, where the new added content has been marked in blue.\n\nSpecifically, although we can use off-the-shelf LLMs to complete Question Decomposition and Candidate Reasoning, we instead employed a fine-tuned LLM in our experiments to achieve better performance. In practice, we chose to finetune the LLaMA model with 7 billion parameters (LLaMA-7B) using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, i.e., LoRA, which we found to achieve reasonably good performance, finished on two NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 graphics cards with 48G memory for each. Thus, the finetuning of Keqing won\u2019t cost too much resources of computation and memory storage."

Applicability of methods proposed methods beyond KBQA setting. \n\nA: To demonstrate that our approach is not only suitable for the KBQA setting but can also be extended to a broader setting, we proceed to test the efficacy of Keqing on the general open-domain QA task. As the experimental results on two multi-hop question-answering datasets, HotpotQA and MuSiQue-Ans, our proposed Keqing achieved new SOTA performance on both these two open-domain QA datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework design.

How are the answers for KBQA are extracted for final F1 measure? since LLMs generate free text, what method is used to extract the final answer from the LLM response?\n\nA: Thanks for your question. Indeed, this is related to the prompt we used during the \u201cCandidate Reasoning\u201d stage, where we intentionally included an instruction for the LLMs\u2019 response format. Specifically, the prompt is as follows. \n\nYou will be provided with a block of text and a question, and your task is to extract all the answer to the question from the given text. Do not generate duplicate answers and do not make up answers if there is no relevant information in the text. The ouput must be in a strict List format.\n\nTherefore, with this prompt, we illustrate an input-output example.\nInput: \nText: {A paragraph describing the facts retrieved from the Knowledge Graph}\\n Question: what does jamaican people speak?\nOutput: \n[\"Jamaican English\", \"Jamaican Creole English Language\"]\n\nThen we compute the F1 score by comparing the output list and the gold answer list. Occasionally the LLM\u2019s responses are not in List format, for those free-text outputs, we manually convert them to lists containing only the answer phrases so that F1 score can be obtained in the same way as above."

The weaknesses and questions have been addressed below.\n\nW1 and Q1: The title of the paper suggests a focus on the CoT mentor, but the main content seems to be centered around a framework that integrates an IR module with a knowledge graph. Could you clarify the relationship between this pipeline and the concept of CoT?\nA1: Thanks, it is correct that main contribution of work is to develop a novel framework to integrate an IR module to retrieve knowledge stored on graph structured datasets to answer the input user question. During the procedure of knowledge retrieval, we will first use LLM to decompose the user question into a series of sub-questions according to predefined question templates, and them as CoT to gradually answer the user question. Considering each question template in a CoT can be solved with logical chains on the knowledge graph, we propose the title ``KNOWLEDGE-BASED QUESTION ANSWERING IS A NATURE CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT MENTOR OF LLMS\u2019\u2019\n\nW2 and Q2: In terms of originality, how does the proposed framework distinguish itself from traditional KBQA systems? Specifically, while aspects like question decomposition and candidate reasoning are familiar in the literature, is this the inaugural application of such a pipeline using LLMs?\nA2: To the best of our knowledge, Keqing is indeed the first instance of KBQA framework to integrate the modules of Question Decomposition, Knowledge Retrieval, Candidate Reasoning, and Response Generation into one entity, which is purely deployed with LLMs.\n\nDistinct from traditional KBQA systems that either rely on laborious rule-based algorithms to achieve question decomposition [1] or individually train a graph neural network to perform candidate reasoning [2], our framework is designed to automate the whole process with as little extra effort as possible. Note that our pipeline can be training-free with least effort by using off-the-shelf LLMs to finish question decomposition and candidate reasoning while maintaining a decent performance, although using finetuned LLMs perform better. In addition, our approach also differs from those recent KBQA systems based on LLMs that typically generate one-step symbolic expressions for the query question leveraging the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, which is error-prone and lacks transparency.\n\nW3 and Q3: The results indicate that the model's performance in a few-shot learning scenario is not on par with state-of-the-art models like Decaf. Could you shed light on the reasons behind this disparity? Which part of the framework or which specific stage might be contributing to this performance gap?\nA3: Actually, our framework is a zero-shot KBQA system rather than based on few-shot learning. Because either in the question decomposition stage or in the candidate reasoning stage, our method do not rely on imitating a few demonstrations to generate responses, i.e., we do not follow the paradigm of in-context learning. And in this respect we are consistent with FlexKBQA[3] rather than KB-BINDER[4]. \n\nAs for the performance gap with state-of-the-art models, we assume it is caused by the capability of generalizing of Llama during question decomposition, because the answers can hardly be correct as long as any part of generated CoT is wrong. And conviction is that the performance of Keqing can be further improved with more powerful pretrained LLMs. \n\n[1] Zheng et al., Question answering over knowledge graphs: question understanding via template decomposition.
