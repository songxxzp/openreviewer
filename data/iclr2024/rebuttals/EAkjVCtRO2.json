You can find below an overview of the major modifications of the manuscript followed by detailed responses to your questions.\n\n- Q1: The two-stage training appears unnecessary in the context of time series. It may lead to sub-optimal results. Do you employ straight-   through trick or Gumbel trick in training your model\n\nA1: Thank you for this thoughtful question. In this paper we propose an efficient, simple and stable way of training our method by training alternatively the emission laws and the prior law of the hidden states. To motivate the proposed two-steps training, we added a justification part in the main text (Section 2.2). Furthermore, a section in Appendix was also added where we compare a one-step training with the proposing one, pointing out instabilities solved by the two-steps training. We acknowledge that additional fine tuning of the implementation could be proposed to improve the training process. This question remains open and will be tackled in the future as well as research perspectives raised in the conclusion of our work.\n\t\n- Q2 :More details should be provided on training the model with discrete latents in the VAE framework, i.e., how the discreteness is handled.\n\nA2: For a better clarity, several ablation studies were added in the appendix in which we questioned some of the choices we made during our implementation. For example, we review in Appendix A.5 the importance of model size, in Appendix A.6, the impact of freezing or learning the variance of our emission laws and in Appendix A.7, the improvements made when we let hidden states depend on time.\n\t\n- Q3:There is only one baseline model based on Transformer. I suspect there are many variants for forecasting.\n\nA3: We thank the reviewer for this constructive comment. We added in Table 1 two other Transformer-based methods (Informer and TimesNet).\n\t\n- Q4: How well does your method work on long context forecasting problem?\n\nA4: In addition to the experiments conducted on the fashion dataset (with a horizon set to 52), we also evaluated our method on a collection of 8 benchmark datasets in Section 3.2. The main motivation for this second set of experiments was to evaluate our approach on different forecasting use cases and evaluate its behavior over different forecasting horizons. We found that the proposed approach can be easily used in a wide range of forecasting tasks while providing accurate forecasts that challenge other state-of-the-art methods."

                        "value": "We thank the referee for his appreciation of our work, aligned with the other reviews that we received. You can find below an overview of the major modifications of the manuscript followed by detailed responses to your questions.\n\t\n- Q1: While the emprical results are nice, it would further strengthen the paper if the authors could perform ablation experiments to uncover/provide a better intuition about why their algorithm performs well against others.\n\nA1: We thank the referee for this suggestion. Following this remark, several ablation studies were added in the appendix. For instance, in Appendix A.6, we provided more justification on the two-steps training process presented in the paper, showing how it solves some training instabilities and improves final model accuracy. Likewise, we reviewed in Appendix A.7 the impact of learning the variance of the emission distributions and in Appendix A.8, the impact of using a Markov chain for the latent states.\n\t\n- Q2:The author's new algorithm performs almost similarly to previous SOTA Transformer-based model PatchTST/64. However, it's unclear from my first reading why one would prefer one over the other. Is it easier to train/better runtime etc.?\n\nA2: We thank the referee for this thoughtful remark and recognize that the motivation for the method presented was not clearly defined enough in the paper. One argument in favor of our method is that it provides probabilistic predictions that allow users to build confidence intervals. On the Fashion use case, by analysing when and where the emission laws having access to the influencers signals is activated, we could spot specific regime shifts in the time series and understand how the proposed approach succeeded at forecasting these challenging patterns. A natural future work would be to propose more complex generative models where Transformer architectures could be used in the transition densities and emission distributions. Such models would benefit from the state space framework and highlight the usefulness of the two stage procedures.\n\t\n- Q3: It's nice that the authors performed a grid search over learning rates and batch size for the other algorithms. I think the paper would be further strengthened if the authors conducted a hyperparameter search also over network size where it make sense (similar to the grid search that the authors performed over hidden size for their network)?\n\nA3: We thank the referee for this suggestion. Thanks to this comment, we provided a complementary ablation study presented in appendix A.5. In this section, we performed a grid search on the number of parameters and compared the optimal size found for our approach with the size of other state-of-the-art methods. We found that our model performed well with an architecture with 700,000 parameters, which is superior to PatchTST, Informer, and DeepAR methods and inferior to N-HiTS, N-BEATS, and TimesNet methods. Considering recent published models for natural language processing or visual detections, there is still a huge margin regarding the size of all current time series forecasting methods."
