                        "value": "Thank you very much for your review which helped up improve the article. \n\n> The benefit of the encoder is unclear. \n\nIn a sense we are asking the question: \u201cCan a diffusion model benefit from a non-trivial time-dependent encoder\u201d. Since we achieve state of the art results on CIFAR-10, we say that the answer is \u201cyes\u201d. Since the encoded image is still in the full image space, the encoding is not directly applicable for representation learning. However, as we mention in the new section 7 (old section 9), it would be an interesting direction for future research to explore how distillations of the time-dependent encodings could be used for representation learning.     \n\n> In spite of the added theoretical overhead incurred by the learned encoder, there is minimal empirical improvement over existing baselines \n\nOur large models achieve state of the art on CIFAR-10 showing a significant improvement over a model that uses the exact same architecture for the generative model. This is an extremely well-studied benchmark so it can be expected that it is difficult to improve SOTA with a lot. Furthermore, we continued training our models until 8 million steps and saw a further performance increase to 2.62 as seen in the updated Table 1. (The VDM paper uses 10 million steps.) \n\n> Empirical validation is slim \n\nWe are currently training models on downscaled ImageNet 32x32. Due to the size of the models we do not have results ready for this response, however, we expect to have them on Monday, where we will share them in a new response.  \n\n> Is there improvement in terms of any other metrics? There is a lot of research on how likelihood can be a poor proxy for generative model performance. \n\nAs mentioned in your reference [1] likelihood and visual quality of samples are not directly linked and therefore the metric used to train a model is important when choosing the application. Since we show that our model can achieve good results on likelihood, and likelihood is important in the context of semi-supervised learning, it would be an interesting direction for future research to use this kind of model for classification in a semi-supervised setting. We have added this possible application to section 7. FID scores are a quite noisy metric, but we have added them to appendix R, and they show that FID scores for the VDM model with v parametrization and DiffEnc are not statistically different. \n\n> Parameterization of the learned encoder is very simplistic. Why is the encoder conditioned only on the time? \n\nThe encoder is dependent on both the time and the original image. As we wrote in the previous version of the article in section 3: $x_t = f_{\\phi}(x, t)$. We have made this more clear in the beginning of the section. In our new figure 1, we also visualize the setup and show how the encoder takes both an image and time as inputs.    \n\n> ...the justification for this parameterization (Appendix I) -- that this makes the math nice -- does not feel entirely sufficient. \n\nThe reason for using $\\alpha_t$ multiplied with the data in the encoder is that we want the encoder to be the identity for t = 0 and to send the mean to 0 for t = 1. This is important for minimizing the reconstruction and latent losses as we mention in the beginning of the new section 4 (old section 6). The argument about making the math nicer is only to justify that instead of using just $\\alpha_t$, we use $\\alpha_t^2$. We have rewritten appendix I to make this clearer. \n\n> Can the authors directly visualize the output of the learned encoder model at different times \n\nGood idea. In our new figure 1, we have some examples of the encoded images. In general, the encoder seems to enhance edges for lower t and bring the mean of the image closer to 0 for higher t, however while keeping more signal for higher t than the non-trainable encoder would. We have clarified this in results in the new section 5 (old section 8.2). \n\n> How does Section 7 (v-prediction parameterization) relate to the rest of the paper? \n\nAs we write in the new section 4 (old section 7), we use the v parametrization in our experiments. The exact equations we use for our loss are using the new numbers (19) and (20), the old numbers were (38) and (39).   \n\n> In which experiments in Section 8 were a fixed noise schedule used, and in which were a learned noise schedule used? \n\nThank you for bringing this lack of clarity to our attention. As we mention in the experimental setup of the new section 5 (old section 8.1), we used fixed endpoints for the noise schedule for the large models and experimented with both fixed and learned endpoints for the small models. Table 2 has results of the large models, so these are with a fixed noise schedule, and we have added this to the caption. In table 3 and 4, we write in the column \u201cnoise\u201d which results are for a fixed noise schedule and which are for a trainable schedule. In the caption of table 5, we write that these results are for a fixed noise schedule."

Instead directly noising the input data points (here images), they are first encoded and then noised. There are two encoding schemes introduced. In one, the encoder has no trainable parameters and is simply a rescaling of the input. In the other, the encoded images are a reweighting of the noise-free image and the output of a time-dependent image-to-image neural network. The authors derive the corresponding loss functions and analyze the model in its infinite depth limit. The results show that the diffusion model equipped with a new encoder achieves state-of-the-art BPD on CIFAR-10."

Overall, I found the writing fairly clear, with some exceptions that I will mention in the next section.

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The presentation of the method, namely section 3 and 6 could be improved significantly. There are a lot of variable names, and I had to read through the section many time in order to understand what was happening, even though the final procedure is not that complex. Moving the figure provided in Appendix A to the main text might be helpful in this regard. Or you could include an algorithm, or simply a link to your code, as these would all be easier to parse as someone familiar with common diffusion code and parlance. The presentation is also strong emulating the style of VDM even though the method has interesting consequences and potential applications on diffusion models more broadly, and simplifying the description of the algorithm to rely less on graphical models and equations and simply describe where noising and denoising are happening might make the approach more accessible to a broader audience.\n\nBeyond the presentation, the results are pretty limited. Given that the proposed method is an incremental change to VDM, the performance improvement is not overwhelming. It feels like an improvement on par with what might be possible through better hyperparameter tuning or by increasing the model capacity (which is implicitly part of what this method is doing, at least in the case where the encoder has learnable parameters). The results being limited to CIFAR-10 compound my intuition that the results aren't very notable, because it's not clear if they generalize. Though I think method appears sound and significant and general results seem possible, the current results feel like a negligible improvement on a relatively small dataset. It would be great to see results paralleling the original VDM model. If the improvements spanned all the datasets considered in the original paper, I would be more convinced that the proposed encoder is doing something significant."

Does this effect the learning of the encoder in a serious way? It might be helpful to explore this a bit more if it is one of the more impactful approximations required to your method practical.\n\nWhat is the intended take-away from Figure 1? Is the significance simply that the learned encoder captures the spatial frequencies that we might expect at each time in the diffusion process? Or do you also conclude that there is an implicit form of segmentation happening? The later feels potentially quite profound but needing more justification while the former feels potentially unsurprising, especially if the gradient signal is just incredibly noisy. It could just be learning very little for t near 1.0."

One might think that this would force $y_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)$ to be close to $dy_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)/dt$, however inspection of some examples show that this is not the case. The reason might be that the normed part of the loss is scaled with $\\alpha_t^2$, and therefore the difference $(y_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t) - dy_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)/dt)$ can be rather large without affecting the total loss notably. Of course, one might get even better results with a better approximation, and this would be an interesting direction for future research.  \n \n> What is the intended take-away from Figure 1?\n\n(In the new version of the paper this is figure 2) In short, the take-away is that the encoder learns to do something different from how it was initialised, and what it learns is different for different timesteps.

The authors put forth a novel iteration of diffusion models that preserves the advantages of VAEs. To be more specific, they introduce a time-dependent DiffEnc, resulting in encoder variations across different time steps. Furthermore, the authors conduct an in-depth exploration of the assumption that forward and backward variances are equal, underpinned by thorough theoretical analysis. In addition, empirical findings are presented to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed DiffEnc."

In the new version of the article, we have done our best to address your concerns.   \n> The paper has very limited evaluation...\n\nWe are currently training models on ImageNet 32x32. However, SOTA models are large and require access to extensive compute. We will share results later in the rebuttal period.\n\n> ...doesn't compare to some of relevant baselines that are even mentioned in the paper, like latent diffusion...\n\nIn Table 1, we compare to all state of the art likelihood-based models for CIFAR-10 without data augmentation. Since we did not use data augmentation on CIFAR-10, we have only compared with other results on non-augmented CIFAR-10. In the latent diffusion paper by Rombach et al 2022 \u201cHigh-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models\u201d, they do not report any likelihoods on CIFAR-10, therefore they have not been included in the table.   \n\n> \u2026it mentions that some methods only show improvement after longer training\n\nBy design, the DiffEnc and VDMv models have the same initial loss. However, the trends differ, especially from around 2 million training steps. Which means that it is only after more than 2 million steps the mean losses differ significantly. We would not say that this shows any kind of inconsistency in the results. We have made this clearer in the description of the results in table 5 which was in the old section 8.2. However, we have had to move table 5 to appendix Q due to the page restriction. \n\n> ...what does it mean that the loss is dominated by the diffusion loss?\n\nBy construction, the VDM model has very small latent and reconstruction loss when using the fixed signal to noise ratio endpoints from the original article. Thus, the diffusion loss is where there is the biggest potential for improvement. We have added a mention of this in results in the new section 5 (old section 8.2) when discussing tables 3-5. \n\n> In section 3, I first missed the added subscript in x_t in eq 13 \n\nThank you for pointing us towards this point of potential confusion. We use $x_t =x_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)$, to remind the reader that the encoded image is dependent on both x and t through $\\lambda_t$. We think that changing the notation to not use x would obfuscate this dependency. We have added \u201cdependent on x and t\u201d when we introduce the encoder in section 3 to clarify.\n\n> In section 6, I was not fully following the parametrisation of $x(\\lambda_t)$ how does this related to eq (13)?\n\nFrom the old section 5 and onwards we write $x_t = x_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)$ to include the dependence of the encoder on the learned parameters, $\\phi$, and the log of the signal to noise ratio, $\\lambda_t$. In the new version we introduce  $x_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t)$ from the beginning of section 3, hopefully, this makes it clearer. When given x, we have for the non-trainable encoder $z_t = \\alpha_t^3x$ and for the trainable encoder $z_t = \\alpha_t(\\alpha_t^2x + \\sigma_t^2 y_{\\phi}(\\lambda_t))$ where $y_{\\phi}$ is the trainable part of the encoder."
