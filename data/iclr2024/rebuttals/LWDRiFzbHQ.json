It finds that re-weighting existing indicators by considering neighboring test samples can solve the imprecise generalization prediction caused by spurious model responses. The authors empirically show that their proposed universal method separates the softmax probability of correct and incorrect predictions farther than original methods, and theoretically certify that this property leads to a successful rank of classification models for the underlying generalization performance."

Predicting softmax probability with considering neighbors is a reasonable method to alleviate this problem.\n3. **[The comparison between model-centric and data-centric approaches in experiments is insteresting.]** My favorite part of this paper is the discussion about the prediction of generalization performance on different setups.

In detail, in the third part of the discussion section and the relevant supplementary material, you do not provide reasons why your proposed method cannot work well under the data-centric setup. The second is that you only discuss the enhancement connection between your proposed method and logit-based methods, but ignore the parallel relationship between your proposed method and non-logit-based methods. For example, both Dispersion Score and COT mention that they can avoid overfitting or miscalibration problems, so what is the advantage of your method?\n3. **[Theoretical insights are unconvincing.]** In my view, the key point of this theoretical part is to certify why your proposed method can separate correct and incorrect samples in the softmax-probability space, rather than to certify that your method can successfully rank classification models based on their generalization performance with the separability property.\n\n[1] Yu, Yaodong, et al. \"Predicting out-of-distribution error with the projection norm.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

In fact, as early as the beginning of 2020, I had tried a similar idea, which is almost identical to the approach described in this paper, and the paper only describes my first version of the attempt. Here is my experience and why I did not continue this research:\n\n\n- Calculating d\u00b5 involves a significant amount of additional time, so I abandoned this approach since the performance of ensemble methods can surpass many calibration methods, and their biggest drawback is the substantial inference cost. If a method cannot outperform an ensemble in terms of time efficiency, its performance needs to surpass that of the ensemble, but I found that the performance of this method cannot exceed the ensemble method.\n\n- To address this issue, I used a neural network to fit the similarity of samples, i.e., training an additional branch on the original network to fit the vicinal score, which transfers the additional time cost to the training process and significantly reduces the time spent during the inference process. However, this method is still unsatisfactory for two reasons: \n \n  - 1. Confidence suffers from severe overfitting, as the confidence of the vast majority of samples in the training set is 1. \n\n  - 2. The proxy estimation of confidence depends on the surrounding samples, which means that it requires good confidence estimation of the surrounding samples, so this estimation does not fundamentally solve the problem.\n\n- Finally, I changed my strategy and used true class probability (TCP[1]) as the confidence of the vicinal sample, which can effectively alleviate the problem of poor confidence estimation of the vicinal sample, to some extent solving the issues.\n\nHowever, I ultimately did not continue to study this work because the method is not elegant enough.\n\n_[1] Corbi\u00e8re C, Thome N, Bar-Hen A, et al.

Borrowing ideas from the general concept of vicinal risk minimization, the authors propose vicinal assessment by integrating model responses of neighboring samples from the test set when computing the score for a given test sample $x$.\n\nThe authors show that their methodology can be applied on top of prior works demonstrating its benefits on a wide range of existing models and a few datasets."

Is there a reason some transformations might be more beneficial than others and in what settings would this be the case? How should these design decisions be made in a general setting?\n\nQ4: Do you apply the same transformation to a give sample all the time, or sample it randomly each time? What happens if you apply and aggregate multiple transformations simultaneously (e.g., grey-scale + color jitters + rotation)?\n\nMinor: Should it be $\\ell(f(\\mathbf{x}), y)$ in Eq. (5) ?
