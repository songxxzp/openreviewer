It assumes that the pose label during training is not accurate. The proposed method first estimates the orientation with a self-supervision. Then the translation is estimated using feature similarity matching which is supervised by a soft-margin triplet loss. The proposed method is evaluated on KITTI and VIGOR datasets with quantitative comparisons. It outperforms most of the SOTA methods, except a recent work in ICCV 2023."

The small-scale accurate label could also help improve the performance if properly designed.\n-\tSome suggestions to think about (Not a weakness): It might also be interesting to consider larger errors for the training images, for example, the satellite-view image has a certain probability of being an incorrect match of the query but is still close to the ground-truth locations. \n-\tThere is still room for improvement in the writing.

Please find our response below, and let us know your further questions.\n\n**1. problem setting.**\n\nThank you for suggesting the semi-supervised application. Our method can be easily adapted to address the scenario when a small amount of training data with accurate pose labels is available by adding additional supervision to the network with this amount of data.\n\nBelow, we show the performance of our method when fine-tuned with different portions of the current training dataset with accurate pose labels. Data amount = 0 indicates the original weakly supervised pipeline where no such data is available.\n\n\n|Data Amount (%)|0|\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u20020.2|0.3\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002|0.4|0.5|0.6|0.7|0.8|0.9|1|\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n|Lateral ($d=1$)|62.73|39.49|44.61|55.31|60.96|65.60|71.48|74.61|78.61|83.86|\n\nThe results show that fine-tuning leads to better performance when the data amount with accurate pose labels is over 50%. However, when the data amount is smaller, the fine-tuning leads to inferior performance. We suspect this is because the model overfits the limited training data with accurate labels, causing a loss of general inference ability on other data.\n\nWe agree a properly designed training method should address this problem, and we would like to explore this further in our future work.\n\nApart from this semi-supervised scenario, we believe the original weakly-supervised application addressed in this paper is also of high importance. It avoids additional effort to select the portion of accurate data, as most localization algorithms and noisy GPS sensors themselves do not provide a measure of whether its prediction is accurate or not. \n\n**2. Consider larger errors for the training images.**\n\nWe are sorry that we did not really understand the question. Let us try our best to explain something according to our understanding, and please let us know your further questions.\n\nWhen the location error of training images is larger, we can increase the coverage of the corresponding satellite image to make it still cover the query image's local surroundings. Our framework is still applicable.\n\nWhen the satellite image is an incorrect match of the query (the actual location of the camera is outside the region covered by the satellite image, and this is not known), our method still compares the similarity between the ground and satellite image across locations on the satellite image, and find the location corresponds to the largest similarity (though the largest similarity is very small).\n\nWhen the satellite image covers the local surroundings of the ground camera, while due to time differences between the two-view images, the ground structure might be changed or the illumination is significantly different (day and night), our method behaves similarly as above. It still compares the similarity between the two view images across possible locations on the satellite image and finds the location corresponds to the largest (though very small) similarity. \n\n**3. The motivation part could be improved.**\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have rewritten the introduction to make the motivation clearer. The revised content is marked as blue. \n\n**4. RTK is not explained when it first appears.**\n\nWe have added the full description of RTK in the abstract: Real Time Kinematics (RTK)\n\n**5. How to obtain more training data with less accuracy requirement on the label?**\n\nA consumer-level mobile phone with built-in GPS, or a consumer-level noisy GPS equipped in a vehicle with a camera, can help to obtain more training data.\n\nThe papers below suggest that GPS-enabled smartphones are typically accurate to **within a 4.9m radius** under open sky and **within around 20m** in dense high rise environments. The experiments conducted in this paper set the GPS error to be within a 56m x 56m region (a 28m radius). Thus, it is easy to use consumer-level smartphones to collect more data for network training.\n\n[1]. Menard T, Miller J, Mowak M, Norris D.

The results are promising on existing datasets, especially when compared to other existing methods. The idea setting this technique apart from others is the abandonment of rigorous exploitation of ground truth camera poses. The paper is well structured and reads easily. Estimating rotation and translation of ground cameras on large scale is a significant problem in many applications. The paper, altough not explicitely mentioned, target representation learning as it addresses the gap in feature representation between overhead satellite images and perspective\n images taken by the ground camera."

                    "value": "Registration of large baseline images is still a challenging problem, especially when it comes to the extreme. Registration of top view and ground images is especially difficult as image features for matching are rare, e.g. because of occlusion, out of plane rotation, etc. The idea in this work is to circumvent this matching problem by considering CNN features on much higher level with much larger receptive fields and semantic information.\nAnother idea of the technique is the possible avoidance of ground truth camera poses needed for training the model. The inference of rotation is thereby trained by a self-supervised learning approach, while translation is interpreted as correlation problem between satellite images and ground images. The training is supervised by a few labeled ground truth poses similar to metric learning problems.\nThe results in table 1 are promising, altough a gap between the solutions w vs. w/o knowledge of ground truth poses still exists. The comparison with other SOTA methods clearly show superiority of the technique (table 2)."

The approach seems to be analog to popular representation learning approaches using contrastive learning. By focusing in you introduction and motivation on these problems and novelties, the paper would make clear its contributions to representation learning, the main topic of this conference.\n\nAt some places in the paper I found incorrect statements:\n- page 2: \"neural networks are inherently sensitive to rotations ...\" in its generality this statement needs to be refused as e.g. equivariant networks address this problem (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.07362.pdf)\n- page 2: \"... synthesised overhead view image ...\" the sentence gives the reader the impression that satellite images are always \"overhead view\" orthographic images which of course is not the case\n- page 4: \"magnitude of the rotation\" ?\n- page 4: \"the equivariance property of convolution to translations ...\" convolution is invariant to translation\n- page 5: Eq 2 descibes the correlation coefficient but later on page 14 a convolution was used"

In practice satellite images are orders of magnitude larger. To be useful in practice, the method needs to find regions of interest in satellite images in order to perform registration.

What if satellite images are orders of magnitude larger?**\n\nIn this work, we consider refining a coarse location of a ground image by ground-to-satellite registration. Thus, given this coarse location and its statistical error, we can extract a satellite image that covers the local surroundings of the query image. In this work, the satellite image coverage is around 100m x 100m (with a resolution of 512 x 512).\n\nWhen the location ambiguity of a ground image is significantly large, for example, at the city or state level, cross-view retrieval is usually applied.

                    "value": "This paper proposes to register an image captured on the ground to a satellite image in two stages. In the first stage, the ground image is projected to a bird's-eye view, and the 2D rotation and translation are estimated between the projected ground image and the satellite image. In the second stage, the 2D translation within the rotated ground image is re-estimated by dense feature patch matching. To facilitate the training, the authors synthesize bird's-eye view images with known rotation and translation as self-supervision from the satellite images. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, the authors conduct experiments on the KITTI and Vigor datasets and achieve better performance than some recent works on ground-satellite image registration."

It is very difficult to learn feature representations that are invariant to these changes. \n   - In order to convince the audience that the gap is small, the authors should a) introduce their data augmentation in detail, b) analyze the feature differences between the projected and actual bird's-eye view images.\n- An important reference is missing: \"OrienterNet: Visual Localization in 2D Public Maps with Neural Matching\", CVPR '23. \n  - The proposed method in this paper is very similar to this missing reference except for the self-supervision. The OrienterNet has achieved better performance than the paper, and more importantly, it is better written with deeper insights. \n  - To highlight the difference, the authors should clearly describe why precise supervision is difficult, which does not seem to be the case for me since we can get precise reconstructions even from a mobile phone and then register a sequence of images to the satellite images."

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer-9PqU for the valuable comments. Please find our response below, and let us know your further questions.\n\n**1: More Justification on the BEV synthesis in Sec. 3.**\n\nOur method does not aim to learn viewpoint invariant features robust to parallax and occlusion. Instead, we want to explore the co-visible regions between the two views and weaken other regions' effect in similarity matching. The co-visible regions mainly concentrate on the ground plane and thus are handled by the ground plane's homography projection. For regions that are not co-visible, we resort to the confidence map to lower their weights in similarity matching. The appearance discrepancy for the co-visible areas is handled by the end-to-end training.\n\nWe discussed why using this simple projection instead of a powerful yet complex cross-view transformer for overhead-view synthesis in Sec. A of the appendix. The main reason is a balance between batch size and the model complexity. A large batch size is important in self/weakly supervised learning by contrastive learning. We also visualized the projected and corresponding satellite feature maps in Sec. B. The ground structures co-visible by both views are aligned well. More discussions are presented in Sec. C.\n\nWe follow previous works for data augmentation: none is applied to ground images, while satellite images are randomly rotated.\n\n**2: Similar to a missing reference OrienterNet (CVPR23)?**\n\nThank you for pointing out this accidentally missed reference. We have added it back to the paper. \n\nBoth works synthesize an overhead-view feature map from the ground-view image and match it against the reference satellite feature map for translation estimation. The **differences** are:\n1. OrienterNet rotates the synthesized overhead view feature map K times and then matches them to the reference satellite image. To avoid the additional search space caused by rotation and obtain continuous rotation estimates, we present a pose regressor for rotation estimation.\n2. Our pose regressor leverages the sensitivity of a normal neural network to the rotation of input signals, and we introduce a self-supervised method for this pose regressor training. Our rotation estimation performance is significantly better than OrienterNet.\n3. Our method does not require ground truth location labels of ground images for network training.\n\n**3: Why precise supervision is difficult? Precise reconstruction can be done from a mobile phone and then register a sequence of images to the satellite images.**\n\nPrecise reconstruction can be obtained from a sequence of ground view images by SfM. However, the GPS of a mobile phone is often noisy. Thus, the absolute geo-location of the reconstructed 3D structure is unknown. Registering reconstructed 3D structures to a satellite image requires complex engineering techniques. From our investigation, there is no readily available technique for this. This effort can be avoided by using the method proposed in this paper. The original noisy GPS signals of ground images can be directly used for network training.\n \n**4: Inferior performance to OrienterNet?**\n\nOrienterNet reports its performance on Test-2 of the KITTI dataset with a single query image, and the model is trained on the original training dataset of KITTI (the same setting as ours). The comparison results are as follows:\n|| Lateral|| Longitudinal|| Orientation||\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n||$d=1$|$d=3$|$d=1$|$d=3$|$\\theta=1^\\circ$|$\\theta=3^\\circ$|\n|OrienterNet|51.26|84.77|22.39|46.79|20.41|52.24|\n|Ours($\\lambda=0$)|62.73|86.53|9.98|29.67|99.66|100.00|\n|Ours($\\lambda=1$)|64.74|86.18|11.81|34.77|99.99|100.00|\n\nThe results of OrienterNet are from Tab.3 of its original paper (OrienterNet(c)).\n\nExcept for the longitudinal pose estimation performance, which is inherently ambiguous in ground-to-satellite image matching, our method achieves significantly better lateral pose and orientation estimation than OrienterNet, even though OrienterNet leverages the ground truth poses for training. In contrast, our method does not have access to this.\n\n**5: Better written with deeper insights.**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have revised our introduction, marked as blue, to convey this paper's idea better.\n\n**6: Performance with supervised training.**\n\nThe performance of our method with full supervision is as follows:\n||Lateral||Longitudinal||Orientation||\n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n||$d=1$|$d=3$|$d=1$|$d=3$|$\\theta=1^\\circ$|$\\theta=3^\\circ$|\n|Test-1|83.86|96.69|30.74|58.65|99.66|100.00|\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\n|Test-2|50.99|79.51|14.62|31.25|99.99|100.00|\n\nThe performance improves significantly for the same-area evaluation (Test-1), while it suffers slight degradation on the cross-area evaluation (Test-2). This is similar to the observation on other fully-supervised methods: models tend to overfit on the training area when ground truth poses are available and further demonstrates that the proposed weakly-supervised approach exhibits strong generalization ability."
