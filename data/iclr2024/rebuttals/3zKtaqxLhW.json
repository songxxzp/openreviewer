The authors argue that current form of knowledge distillation does not cater for auto-regressive language models; a student model faces discrepancy between the samples seen in the training and those generated by itself in inference. Inspired by imitation learning, the authors propose on-policy KD, where the student generates a sequence and \"imitates\" the teacher. In addition, the authors illustrate the proposed on-policy KD can be easily coupled with RL finetuning."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to provide their helpful and valuable feedback. Our response follows:\n\n> **The authors argue that \"auto-regressive sequence models suffer from train-inference distribution mismatch\", but this argument requires thorough citations. [1] argues that the mismatch may not be critical.** \n\nThanks for pointing out [1], which we have missed earlier. Since [1], there has been follow-up research which demonstrates the exposure bias leads to poor generation quality and text degeneration [2, 3, 4]. We have added this discussion to the related work.\n\n[2] Bridging the Gap between Training and Inference for Neural Machine Translation. ACL (2019)\n\n[3] Relating neural text degeneration to exposure bias. arXiv preprint (2021).\n\n[4] Why Exposure Bias Matters: An Imitation Learning Perspective of Error Accumulation in Language Generation. ACL Findings (2022).\n\n\n> **It would be interesting to see if the proposed KD works on self-knowledge distillation, where a teacher and a student are of the same size.**\n\nTo investigate this, we ran a self-distillation experiment on GSM8K with FLAN-T5 large as the student and teacher, where the teacher is supervised fine-tuned on GSM8K. As shown in Appendix A.2, we find that self-distilled students surpass the teacher's performance on the test set. Moreover, KD approaches using student-generated data outperform supervised KD, with on-policy GKD performing the best with a 5.5% accuracy improvement over teacher.\n\n> **The organization can be improved. The authors allocate much of this paper on different divergences, yet the use of different divergences seems trivial.**\n\nIndeed, different divergences can be easily plugged in GKD, but their impact on performance as well as their task-dependence of the optimal divergence hasn\u2019t been thoroughly explored. That said, based on reviewer's feedback, we moved the figure about mode-seeking vs mode-covering divergences to the appendix. Furthermore, we do plan to include the task-agnostic KD (Appendix A.1)  and self-distillation results (Appendix A.2) to the main paper, but have to figure out the 9 page constraint. \n\n\n> **In Figure A.13, why does the temperature of the teacher bring a significant difference in the performance? Temperatures are hardly set to 0.2, but the student works best when temp is set to 0.2.**\n\t\nIn Figure A.13, we consider a non-standard KD setup where we fix the student temperature to 1 for both training and evaluation on XSum and vary the teacher temperature. Lowering the teacher temperature results in a better performing teacher, which the student tries to mimic by minimizing some divergence to the tempered teacher distribution.\n\nHowever, in the main paper, we set the student and teacher training temperature to 1 (standard setup) to approximate the true teacher distribution. In this setup, we can vary the student's decoding temperature at inference and find that greedy sampling (temperature = 0) performs much better than using a fixed temperature of 1. We highlight this temperature dependence in Figure 4 where we show the impact of the student's inference temperature on task performance and diversity.\n\n--------\n*We hope that most of the reviewer\u2019s concerns have been addressed and, if so, they would reconsider their assessment. We\u2019d be happy to engage in further discussions.*"

GKD trains the student model using self-generated output sequences with guidance from the teacher model. It offers the flexibility to employ alternative loss functions between the student and teacher and enables the seamless integration of distillation with reinforcement learning fine-tuning. GKD significantly improves the performance of student models compared to traditional knowledge distillation methods. The paper's contributions include the introduction of GKD, the use of alternative divergence measures, and the combination of distillation with reinforcement learning fine-tuning for the popoular large language models (LLMs)."

Our response follows:\n\n> **It would be helpful to see comparisons on a wider range of datasets and tasks to demonstrate the generalizability of GKD**\n\nTo complement our results on the efficacy of GKD for task-specific distillation on summarization, translation and reasoning tasks, we added a task-agnostic distillation experiment in **Appendix A.1**. Specifically, we distill using the FLAN instruction tuning dataset (5.36M examples) containing several tasks and evaluate it on two held-out benchmarks: MMLU (57 tasks) and Big-Bench Hard (23 tasks). On-policy GKD with reverse KL outperforms common KD approaches (Figure A.10) and achieves +2% and +1% absolute accuracy gain on MMLU and BBH respectively.\n\n> **The authors should explicitly state the contributions in a dedicated section .. to help readers quickly grasp the paper's core contributions.**\n\nWe agree and have added the key contributions in the introduction in the revision.\n\n> **GKD has been popular in related works (Parisotto et al., 2015; Kelly et al., 2019; Agarwal et al., 2022), but it has not been applied to distilled autoregressive models, so the idea of \u200b\u200bthis work is not very novel**\n\nWhile use of on-policy data is popular in robotics and deep RL, our work takes inspiration from these works to introduce GKD for distillation of autoregressive models. Additionally, prior works in RL and robotics mainly focus on forward KL, while we also explore alternative divergences, which could be better in terms of performance and diversity depending on the task. Overall, GKD could be practically significant as it is simple to implement, outperforms prevalent KD approaches, and can be easily combined with RL fine-tuning of autoregressive models.\n\n> **In line 10 of Algorithm 1, the gradient calculation of $L_{GKD}$  is incorrect, right? Because that just corresponds to the gradient of a special case of supervised KD when $\\lambda$ is 0**\n\nThe gradient is correct \u2013 indeed, $\\lambda = 0$ corresponds to supervised KD when setting divergence D to forward KL. Different choices of $\\lambda$ and divergence lead to other GKD variants. GKD is close to supevised training as it does not backpropagate through the student's sampling process, which makes it quite simple to implement and stable in practice.\n\n> **Why is it helpful to introduce output sequences from the student in the training set during distillation? Provide a detailed explanation**\n\nWhen training only on a fixed dataset of output sequences, the sequences generated token-by-token during inference by the student can look quite different from the fixed dataset sequences, which we call train-inference distribution mismatch. This mismatch can lead to poor text generation quality [1, 2, 3]. When using student-generated data during distillation, the student receives token-specific feedback from the teacher's logits on the erroneous tokens in its self-generated output sequences. This enables a form of feedback loop akin to what we observe in RL, which helps minimize the train-inference mismatch. Moreover, as the student evolves during training, the quality of data it generates also improves. We have included this in the revision.\n\nFor example, on GSM8K, if the student samples a partial solution with some mathematical symbol being incorrect (e.g., using $+$ instead of $\\times$), the rest of the solution would also be incorrect. The teacher's feedback can steer the student towards the correct symbol, and in turn towards the correct solution. \n\n[1] Bridging the Gap between Training and Inference for Neural Machine Translation.

Below are responses to their concerns:\n\n> **Missing comparison between GKD and ImitKD/f-distill in NMT.**\n\nWe have added this comparison in the **Appendix A.6**. On-policy GKD leads to 53% higher BLEU improvement over ImitKD and 162% over f-distill, averaged across small and base models.\n\n> **To verify .. that GKD alleviates train-test distribution mismatch, the authors may consider including an experiment with a mismatched test domain.**\n\nThe train-test distribution mismatch (also known as exposure bias in NLP) corresponds to mismatch between \u201cfixed\u201d output sequences seen during model training vs sequences generated auto-regressively by the model at inference, irrespective of the test domain. To clarify this in the revision, we renamed it to \u201ctrain-inference\u201d distribution mismatch.\n\nNevertheless, to explore the generality of GKD, we added a task-agnostic distillation experiment in **Appendix A.1**. Specifically, we distill using the FLAN instruction tuning dataset (5.36M examples) containing several tasks and evaluate it on two held-out benchmarks: MMLU (57 tasks) and Big-Bench Hard (23 tasks). On-policy GKD with reverse KL outperforms common KD approaches (Figure A.10) and achieves +2% and +1% absolute accuracy gain on MMLU and BBH respectively.\n\n>  **ImitKD/f-distill adopts similar imitation learning ideas to GKD, except that GKD makes $\\lambda$ tunable and explores different divergences.**\n\nIndeed, both ImitKD and f-distill can be viewed as special cases of GKD. However, on-policy GKD ($\\lambda=1$), which hasn\u2019t been explored prior to our work, outperforms both ImitKD and f-distill across several tasks. Additionally, the combination of GKD with RLHF is novel. Furthermore, our work highlights the task-dependent nature of optimal divergence as well as the importance of on-policy data, which could be useful for practitioners.\n\n> **GKD seems to be computationally expensive due to the need of fine-tuning a good student initialization and sampling from student distribution. What is the computational overhead?**\n\nAll methods including baselines start from the supervised fine-tuned student checkpoint, which requires training for a few hours on the smallest TPUv3 (8 cores). The computational overhead from student sampling is approximately $1.8\\times$, $2\\times$ and $2.2\\times$ compared to sampling from a fixed dataset of outputs, for a student-teacher ratio of $38\\times$, $12\\times$ and $3.8\\times$. For RLHF + GKD, the computational overhead is somewhat small as we are only running inference to get teacher logits instead of student logits. \n\nWe believe that the majority of cost in real world use cases is due to serving cost at inference time and not due to fine tuning. Concretely, if it is too costly to sample from the student during fine-tuning, it might also be too expensive to serve this model to users, which may range from tens of thousands to billions. Overall, performance benefits from on-policy GKD might be worth the compute cost, especially when combined with RLHF. We have added this discussion in Appendix A.3.\n\n-----\n*We hope that most of the reviewer\u2019s concerns have been addressed and, if so, they would reconsider their assessment.
