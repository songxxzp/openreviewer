What made it however even tougher for me to follow is that it is very difficult to understand when and where exactly the structure of the neural network is actually used in the theory. The authors start with a rather abstract introduction to Ricci flow, Ricci solitons etc, which is great to have, but then the connection to continuous-depth networks happens very suddenly and in an unclear manner. What exactly is the structure of the neural network determining in the equations? Or differently put, which quantities previously kept abstract (e.g. the manifold, the metric tensor at time $t$, the Ricci curvature etc) is now determined by assuming a neural network structure? I believe it is the diffeomorphisms? \n\nAlso, why are we working with the homogeneous Ricci flow instead of the standard Ricci flow? The authors also use a lot of concepts without introducing them, what is ad(K)-invariant for instance? Such things might be obvious to researchers closely working in this field, but even for people interested in theoretical ML research, this paper is really tough to read. There are lots of statements like \u201cThere is no doubt that after the discretisation, Eq 11 will degenerate into Eq 4\u201d that are not obvious to me at least. \n\\\n\\\nI think the ideas in this work are interesting, but the work in its current shape really does not explain them well, making it very difficult for me to assess this work positively. I\u2019m happy to re-consider my score if the authors can clarify and potentially incorporate my feedback."

On page 6, when you define the Ricci curvature as the Lie derivative (equation 9), in the third line of the derivation, where did the diffeomorphisms $\\phi_{V}^{\\delta t}$ and its pullback $(\\phi_{V}^{\\delta t})^{*}$ go? How are they defined in case of a neural network? I guess the diffeomorphisms is simply the forward pass from time $0$ to time $\\delta t$? \n2. For equation (10) right hand side, where did the limit $\\lim_{\\delta t \\xrightarrow{} 0}$ go? Similarly in equation (12), the left-hand side seems to depend on $\\delta t$ while the right-hand side does not. There is also no dependence on $a$ in the product. \n3. Where in the theory do you explicitly use the fact that the output space is Euclidean? What would change if another structure were imposed?"

                    "value": "* The naming of \"Ricci Flow\" is incorrect/misleading. Really, this is an intrinsic geometric flow, of which the Ricci Flow is a special case. This is because the intrinsic geometric flow evolves the metric according to some diff eq (in this case one parameterized by the neural network), whereas the Ricci Flow is a prescribed partial differential equation that doesn't depend on the neural network.\n* The method can be simplified considerably in presentation (effectively removing most of the unnecessary manifold/homogenous space constructions). In particular, the real question is how does the jacobian $J$ evolve according to time (the other stuff is used to make sure it doesn't degenerate), as the pullback metric is just the inverse of $J^T J$ (from which one can compute the evolution $\\frac{d J^T J}{dt} = J^T \\frac{dJ}{dt} + \\frac{dJ}{dt}^T J$), which is already well known. This is actually cleaner than the current method, which doesn't utilize the fact that $\\frac{dJ}{dt}$ is known for ODEs and instead has to approximate with a step size.\n* The method has an intrinsic limitation since the Jacobian scales poorly with input/output dimension.\n* Experimentally, the results are only shown for extremely toy 2d data through visualization. Beyond showing ``the method can extract something\", this section doesn't convey much else."
