                    "value": "The authors seek to explain the phenomenon of grokking highlighted by Power, Burda, Edwards, Babuschkin, and Misra in arXiv 2201.02177, focusing on a theoretical analysis, and paying special attention to sharpness of the transition from memorisation to generalisation.  The central thesis in this paper, which is summarised in its title, is that grokking occurs due to different implicit biases in early and late training.  Several theoretical results in support of this are proved for training by gradient flow homogeneous neural networks with large initialisations and small weight decay, for classification as well as regression tasks.  The pattern is that general theorems are proved first, and then corollaries are derived that explain grokking in specific settings, such as classification using diagonal linear networks, or low-rank symmetric matrix completion.  In the final section, the authors consider other scenarios where grokking occurs; they provide numerical experiments without weight decay for learning modular addition using two-layer ReLU networks, and they show how theoretical results from Li, Wang, and Arora in ICLR 2021 confirm grokking when training two-layer diagonal linear networks by label noise SGD with a sufficiently small learning rate."

Moreover, the versatility of the explanation in terms of the implicit biases is demonstrated by the identification of \"misgrokking\" in this paper, a dual phenomenon in which the test accuracy transitions from very high to very low late in the training.\n\nGrokking and misgrokking as indicated by the theory are verified by numerical experiments for classification using two-layer diagonal linear networks.\n\nFull proofs of the theoretical results are provided in the appendix.  The biggest and most novel are those of Theorems 3.3 and 3.7, which show that the small weight decay does not spoil the kernel regime and its implicit bias early in the training for long enough so that a relatively short transitional phase follows."

Another is that the statements of many of the theoretical results are relatively complex, with several quantifications and subtle details, and often without much explanation.\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing out this issue! We have polished the writing and changed the organization in the revised version. Now we have included a lot of explanations for our assumptions and theorems.\n\n**Q2:** The theoretical results about grokking for regression tasks, and in particular for overparameterised matrix completion, are not illustrated experimentally.\n\n**A:** Thanks for the suggestion. In the revised version, we have added an experiment on matrix completion for the multiplication table; please see the \u201cEmpirical validation\u201d paragraph of Sec. 3.3.3 for more details.\n\n**Q3:** The conclusion of the paper (Section 5) does not seem to indicate any directions for future work.\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing this out. We have now added two possible future directions in the last section. First, our work only studies the training dynamics with large initialization and small weight decay, but these may not be the only source of the dichotomy of the implicit biases. Also, our work focuses on understanding the cause of grokking but does not study how to make neural nets generalize without so much delay in time. We leave it to future work to explore the other sources of grokking and practical methods to eliminate grokking.\n\n**Q4:** In the first sentence in \"Our Contributions\", it is claimed that homogeneous networks allow the ReLU activation, but Assumption 3.1 assumes smoothness\n\n**A:** Thanks for pointing this out. We have clarified this issue in the paragraph following Assumption 3.1. Indeed, the specific examples on sparse linear classification and matrix completion that we consider in this paper satisfy this assumption, but for non-smooth functions, we believe that our analysis can be generalized by invoking clarke differential, similar to previous works on homogeneous nets (Lyu and Li, 2020; Ji and Telgarsky, 2020).\n\nKaifeng Lyu and Jian Li.

We have included our code in the supplementary material.\n\n**Q6:** What is the purpose of the section on sharpness reduction with label noise (Section 4.2), since it mostly consists of statements of results from Li et al. (2021)?\n\n**A:** The main purpose of this section is to point out that sharpness reduction is another form of implicit bias that provably causes grokking. Although this section does not include original theoretical contributions, we still think it valuable to notice the connection between the grokking phenomenon and previous works."

However, I do not see any statements, analysis or proofs in the main paper for generalization risks (or make generalization guarantees).\n\nWithout the above, the best one can conclude is that the models can fit the training data and reach perfect training accuracy eventually but this line of work has already been done by Moroshko et. al (Moroshko).

Can the authors add more examples in text with datasets commonly used in ``Grokking'' literature?\n- One point that the paper makes is about identifying a transition time from memorization to generalization and attributes it to different inductive biases. This is not true when weight decay = 0 which is a case handled that the paper talks about as well. This suggestion weakens about the importance of the first phase as it may not even be necessary to understand ``Grokking''"

                        "value": "### Main Concerns\n\n**Q1:** The core claim of \"sharp transition in test accuracy\" is not supported by any of the generalization analyses. Without such an analysis, the best one can conclude is that the models can fit the training data and reach perfect training accuracy eventually.\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for raising the concern.\n1. In our paper, we have instantiated our theorems on regression tasks on the matrix completion example in Sec. 3.3.3. We can prove that initially gradient flow can fit the observed entries but make no progress on the remaining ones, but eventually it can generalize to unobserved entries and recover the ground truth.\n2. For classification tasks, we added generalization bounds in the updated version of our paper. Concretely, in the \u201cempirical validation: grokking\u201d part of Sec. 3.2.3, where we consider the sparse linear classification task, we added generalization bounds (proved in Section E), showing that the sample complexity required for achieving good generalization in the kernel regime is much higher than that of the rich regime.\n3. In the general cases, our main results for both classification (Thm. 3.4 and 3.5) and regression (Thm. 3.9 and 3.10) settings highlight a sharp kernel-to-rich transition from $T=\\frac{1-c}{\\lambda}\\log\\alpha$ to $T=\\frac{1+c}{\\lambda}\\log\\alpha$. As the reviewer noticed, our results do not directly lead to generalization guarantees. However, for general deep learning, it is known to be very hard to provide any tight generalization bounds. In the literature, existing generalization bounds for DL are usually vacuous in real-world settings, and no generalization measures are known to be fully predictive of the actual generalization error in practice. Hence, the line of works on implicit bias usually uses the following strategy: analyze the training dynamics and show how the training method shapes a neural net\u2019s properties that are known to be correlated with generalization, then exemplify the result in simple settings with generalization analysis. This is indeed the strategy we take.\n\n**Q2:** Comparison with Moroshko et al. (2020)\n\n**A:** While Moroshko et al. (2020) also characterize the implicit bias in the kernel and rich regimes, our results differ from theirs in two crucial aspects:\n1. We consider running gradient flow with weight decay, while they do not use weight decay.\n2. Our results highlight a sharp transition from kernel to rich regimes, while their paper does not imply such transition bounds.\n\n### Other Questions\n\n**Q3:** Can the authors add more examples in text with datasets commonly used in ``Grokking'' literature?\n\n**A:**\n1. The grokking phenomenon was originally observed on modular arithmetic datasets. In the revised version of the paper, we conducted experiments on modular addition and showed that enlarging the initialization scale or reducing the weight decay indeed delays the sharp transition in test accuracy. This is consistent with our theory, which predicts the grokking time to be scaled with $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ and $\\log(\\text{init scale})$,\n2. Beyond algorithmic datasets, Liu et al. (2023) observed that grokking can also be induced by using a large initialization and a small but nonzero weight decay. This is true for many tasks, including image classification on MNIST and sentiment analysis on IMDB. This can be seen as an important justification of our theory.\n\nZiming Liu, Eric J Michaud, and Max Tegmark. Omnigrok: Grokking beyond algorithmic data. In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.\n\n**Q4:** One point that the paper makes is about identifying a transition time from memorization to generalization and attributes it to different inductive biases. This is not true when weight decay = 0, which weakens the importance of the first phase as it may not even be necessary to understand ``Grokking''.\n\n**A:** In Sec 4 (now Sec B.1), we have included a discussion on the training regime without weight decay, where the perfect generalization is delayed. However, the transition in test accuracy is extremely slow: in Fig 2 (now Fig 4), we have shown that the transition lasts from $10^{10^2}$ to $10^{10^6}$ in continuous time. (The experiments are done via some simulation with unnaturally growing LR.) This means this grokking phenomenon is not relevant to the practice. It also does not quite satisfy the most strict definition of grokking, where the transition is required to be \u201csharp\u201d.\n\nIn contrast, in our main setting, we study training with large initialization and small weight decay, where the transition in the implicit bias is very sharp: $\\frac{1-c}{\\lambda} \\log \\alpha$ leads to the kernel predictor, but increasing it slightly to $\\frac{1+c}{\\lambda} \\log \\alpha$ leads to a KKT solution of min-norm/max-margin problems associated with the neural net."

It shows that in both classification and regression settings, there are early and late implicit biases. Particularly, it shows that in the early phase the model corresponds to a kernel model and later it can escape it. It suggests that grokking happens when the solution given by the early implicit bias generalizes poorly while the solution given by the late bias generalizes well. It is also shown that the converse phenomenon can happen which they call misgrokking. \n\nAs an example, the paper focuses on a simple diagonal linear neural net for classification and shows that the early and late bias resp. correspond to minimization of L2 and L1 margin. They also identify these biases for a matrix completion model. \n\nThe paper further provides experiments showing that grokking can happen even in the absence of weight decay."

                        "value": "### Main Questions\n\n**Q1:** What are the limitations of the analysis done in this paper? Ignoring the proof difficulties, do you think the change of implicit biases can be observed and explain grokking in more common settings?\n\n**A:**\n1. We added new experiments on modular addition in Sec. 2 to confirm that enlarging the initialization scale or reducing the weight decay indeed delays the sharp transition in test accuracy. Beyond algorithmic dataset, Liu et al. (2023) observed that large initialization and small weight can induce grokking on many popular tasks, including image classification, sentiment analysis and molecules. Thus, we believe that our theoretical insights on implicit bias can have broad implications in these settings as well.\n2. One limitation is that our analysis can only handle the training dynamics with large initialization and small weight decay, but these may not be the only source of the dichotomy of the implicit biases. We further discuss in Sec B (previously Sec 4) that the late phase implicit bias can also be induced by implicit margin maximization and sharpness reduction, though the transition may not be as sharp as the weight decay case.\n\n**Q2:** What would be the effects of stochasticity in GD (SGD) and large step size (distancing from gradient flow)?\n\n**A:** As the training pipeline of deep learning can induce many confounding factors (e.g., stochastic noise, finite step size, weight decay, etc.), in this paper we focus on identifying simple yet insightful theoretical setups where grokking with sharp transitions can be rigorously proved and its mechanism can be intuitively understood. This is the reason why we focus on gradient flow in our analysis, and we leave it as future work to explore the effects of noise and large LR.\n\n\n**Q3:** Can you further explain Remark 3.11?\n\n**A:** Remark 3.11 (now Remark 3.13) states that if we use random initialization as stated in Theorem 3.10 (now Theorem 3.12) with small variance $\\sigma^2$, then gradient flow on the matrix completion problem exhibits a transition from the kernel regime to rich regime. We need to add noise to initialization here because gradient flow may get stuck at saddle points for some initial points that form a zero-measure set. The result of the rich regime is already stated in Theorem 3.10. For the kernel regime, Corollary 3.9 (now Corollary 3.11) only applies to deterministic initialization, but if we add sufficiently small noise to the initialization, the trajectory of gradient flow would remain close to the original one for arbitrarily long time period, so gradient flow would still learn a solution that is close to the one in Corollary 3.9 (now Corollary 3.11).\n\n**Q4:** Can you further explain the learning rate and time scaling for Figure 2?\n\n**A:** The time scaling in Figure 2 (now Figure 4) is in log scale or double log scale. The main point of this figure is to show that implicit margin maximization can take an extremely long time to improve generalization. To simulate gradient flow for a very long time, we set the learning rate as $\\frac{\\eta}{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta(t))}$, where $\\eta$ is a constant. The main intuition behind this is that the Hessian of $\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)$ can be shown to be bounded by $O(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(||\\theta||))$, and gradient descent stays close to gradient flow when the learning rate is much lower than the reciprocal of the smoothness. Since we view gradient descent as a simulation of gradient flow, the variable \u201ct\u201d in the figure stands for the continuous time, calculated by summing the learning rates up to this point. We have included these details in the revision.\n\n**Q5:** Is there any proof provided for Theorem 4.1?\n\n**A:** We do not view Theorem 4.1 (now Theorem B.1) as a part of our novel theoretical contributions because it directly follows from the previous paper (Li et al., 2021). Still, we present this theorem since it is worth pointing out that (Li et al., 2021) implicitly demonstrated one possible cause of grokking, which does not seem to be known in the literature.\n\n**Q6:** Can you clarify \u2026 [about a proof step in Lemma A.5 and B.2]\n\n**A:** At the beginning of Sec. A.2 (now Sec. C.2), we define $T_{\\max} := \\inf\\\\{ t \\ge 0 :\\|\\frac{e^{\\lambda t}}{\\alpha}\\theta(t) - \\bar{\\theta}\\| > \\epsilon_{\\max}\\\\}$. In our proof of Lemma A.5, for all $t \\le \\min\\\\{T_{\\max}, \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\log \\alpha - \\frac{1}{L} \\log \\log A + \\Delta T)\\\\}$, we can derive the bound $\\|\\frac{1}{\\alpha}e^{\\lambda t}\\theta(t) - \\bar{\\theta}\\| \\le \\epsilon_{\\max}$, so by definition we must have $T_{\\max}\\ge \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(\\log \\alpha - \\frac{1}{L} \\log \\log A + \\Delta T)$.\n \n**Q7:** What are q and r?\n\n**A:** Sorry for the confusion of notations here. The function $q_i(\\theta)$ is defined as $y_i f_i(\\theta)$ (following Lyu & Li, 2020), and $r_i(\\theta) = \\ell(f_i(\\theta); y_i) = \\exp(-q_i(\\theta))$ (following Moroshko et al., 2020). We have updated the paper."
