The proposed method is novel and well motivated to me. To the best of my knowledge, most existing multmodal fusion methods tend to fuse information from multiple source in a static manner. The proposed method fuses features in a dynamic and recursive manner, which is new and interesting.\n3. The proposed method are evaluated on various multimodal benchmarks, including multi-omics analysis, image-text classification, audio-text sentiment analysis and visual question answering. I appreciate the extensive experimental results. Additionally, the authors claim that the proposed DEQ fusion is readily pluggable to existing multimodal frameworks, which is very promising."

Computational cost: Though recursively fusing multimodal information is quite novel and have a chance to get better performance, I wonder if the proposed method is more time-consuming that its counterparts? It seems such comparisons is lack in the main paper and supplementary. Given this point, I encourage the authors to share more explanations about this.\n2. Scalability: As the authors claim that DEQ fusion is readily pluggable to existing multimodal frameworks, I think it is deserving to further clarify how to combining DEQ fusion into existing multimodal fusion methods. For example, some pseudo code code will be very appreciated and make the proposed method easier to follow.\n3. Motivation: The authors claim that DEQ fusion is an unified framework that looks into three aspects simultaneously including stabilizing and aligning multimodal signals, integrating interactions across modalities from multi-level, dynamically perceiving information. In my view, many attention-based multmodal fusion methods may also achieve the aforementioned points. In section 3.3, the authors say that DEQ fusion is not depend on any unimodal feature extraction or preprocessing methods. However, there exists some attention-based fusion methods which may also independent on unimodal feature extraction methods. For example, a simple self-attention module or MMTM[1]. Could the authors give some further clarifications?\n\n[1] Joze, Hamid Reza Vaezi, et al. \"MMTM: Multimodal transfer module for CNN fusion.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2020."

Please find our responses below.\n\n> Computation cost.\n\nWe have tracked the runtime of DEQ fusion on VQA-v2, the results are 0.338 and 0.405 seconds per batch without and with DEQ fusion respectively. Since the majority of the runtime is due to the unimodal feature extractors, we believe that we can tolerate this computational overhead to achieve higher performance\n\n> Scalability.\n\nThanks for your advice. Please find the pseudo codes below written in PyTorch. Inserting our DEQ fusion requires only modifying three line of codes within the model. Also note that we will release our source codes.\n\n```diff\n    class Model(nn.Module):\n\n        def __init__(self, ...):\n            ...\n+           self.fusion = DEQFusion(...)\n\n        def forward(self, x):\n            ...\n-           fused_feature = torch.cat([feat for feat in unimodal_feats]) # unimodal_feats contains all features extracted from unimodal encoders\n+           fused_feature = self.fusion(unimdaol_feats)\n            ...\n```\n\n> Motivation.\n\nThanks for pointing us to MMTM. MMTM leverages the squeeze and excitation (SE) technique to recalibrate the channel-wise features from multiple CNN streams for multimodal feature alignment. This work provides additional evidence for one of the mentioned key elements: stabilizing and aligning multimodal features. We have included MMTM in our revised paper to provide further evidence to strengthen this element.\n\nWe are also aware that MMTM is also capable of capturing high-level information. Similar to other works that perform higher-level information integration, this high-level information is captured by stacking multiple fusion units. As a result, MMTM requires manual design of different architectures for different applications. Quoting from MMTM: \n>>\"Although the module design is generic and could potentially be added at any level in the network hierarchy, the optimal locations and number of modules are different for each application\". \n\nAs such, how many fusion units are needed to obtain the optimal fused feature still remains a question for these types of works, whereas our approach is fully self-adaptive and requires minimal manual design."

However, given the paper\u2019s focus on fusion of features, which is traditionally associated with late fusion, there seems to be a discrepancy. The paper apparently does not delve into early or middle fusion strategies. To reconcile this, one could interpret \u201cevery level\u201d as referring to different stages or aspects within the late fusion process itself, although this may require clarification from the authors for a precise understanding.\n-  The ablation studies conducted on the BRCA and CMU-MOSI datasets highlight the significance of the DEQ, a component not originally introduced by this work, overshadowing the impact of f_{\\theta} and f_{fuse}. This raises concerns regarding the efficacy of the designed architecture in fully capitalizing on the potential for interaction among modalities. It suggests a need for further investigation and possibly a reevaluation of the architecture to ensure optimal performance.\n-  The introduction categorizes three ways \u2018stabilizing and aligning..., integrating..., dynamically perceiving...\u2019 but provides limited insights, necessitating to explain the reason behind. It should be clarified that how each way contributes to better multi-modal learning. For instance, the rationale behind the need for a multi-modal model to eliminate redundancy is not clear. A thorough analysis is essential to elucidate why previous research has concentrated on these specific approaches, helping to strengthen the foundational knowledge and context for the study. \n-  Furthermore, it is recommended that the authors provide a more comprehensive explanation regarding the advantages of this design in stabilizing intra-modal representations. A thorough exploration of the key difference compared to previous research, particularly in terms of enhancing stability, would enhance the reader's understanding. \n-  While the proposed architecture aims to achieve stable intra-modal representations, its application is limited for it only targets to the fusion of features. This raises the question of whether the method could also encompass the learning of stable uni-modal encoders, fostering the acquisition of even more robust features. Exploring this avenue could potentially enhance the method\u2019s applicability and effectiveness."

                        "value": "Thanks for your valuable feedback. Please find our responses below.\n\n> Confusion with the phrase \"every level\".\n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3, our DEQ fusion is indeed a type of late fusion. The term \"every level\" is thus within the late fusion process itself, where the level indicates the level of information integrated into the fused feature. When we consider the high-level information, it is mainly the product of deeper networks.\n\n> Concerns with ablation studies.\n\nOur focus is to develop a robust and generalizable multimodal fusion framework. As shown in Tables 5 and 7, naively applying DEQ to unimodal feature extractors or the fused feature leads to suboptimal results, whereas considering intra- and inter-modality features jointly (our approach) gives the best results. We would like to emphasize that our designs of $f_\\theta$ and $f_{fuse}$ are not unique. One may consider employing modality-specific alternatives to further boost performance, however, this is not the focus of our work.\n\n> Further explanation on the three keys of successful multimodal fusion.\n\nWe have included a further explanation in our revised paper, please find our revision for the related work section (Appendix B). Please note that these findings are suggested and backed up by several previous works.\n\n> Explanation in stabilizing representations.\n\nThe principle of DEQ fusion is that the equilibrium state of the fused feature satisfies $z_{fuse}^{(i+1)}=f(z_{fuse}^{(i)})$ (slightly simplifies the notation here), which achieves stable multimodal representation while considering multi-level intra- and inter-modality feature fusion. Because it is important to ensure the *dynamic* fusion process, i.e., any modality needs to account for information from all other modalities (as suggested by [1,2,3]), we thus do not particularly emphasize unimodal feature stability.\n\n> DEQ for unimodal learning.\n\nThe results for this are in Tables 5 and 7, where we evaluate DEQ applied to the unimodal encoders ($f_\\theta$ with DEQ). On all three benchmarks, applying DEQ to unimodal encoders contributes to a 1-2% gain over most evaluation metrics. By jointly considering unimodal and multi-modal features, we are able to achieve optimal results.\n\n> Dimensions of the vector.\n\nThe features $z$ are of the same dimension as the unimodal features $x$, such that we can compute the summation in equation 8. The dimensions of the features can be freely altered depending on the model output dimensions and different fusion module designs.\n\n> Confusion about Multi-bench.\n\nMulti-bench integrates many multimodal fusion methods and benchmarks, which is readily deployable for experiments. Our experiments including compared methods were reproduced with Multi-bench on MM-IMDB.\n\n> Vectorized $\\alpha$.\n\nThis is updated in the revised paper.\n\n[1] Han, Zongbo, et al. \"Multimodal dynamics: Dynamical fusion for trustworthy multimodal classification.\" CVPR 2022.\n\n[2] Wang, Yikai, et al. \"Multimodal token fusion for vision transformers.\" CVPR 2022.\n\n[3] Xue, Zihui, and Radu Marculescu. \"Dynamic multimodal fusion.\" CVPR 2023."

This is updated in the revised paper.\n\n2. The relevant results are provided in the Tables 5 and 7. We will also highlight our results here and provide further explanations for your reference. On BRCA, we found that directly applying DEQ on unimodal encoders and then performing fusion with simple concatenation or summation improves the baseline accuracy to 88.8%. This result is shown in the third row of Table 5 with $f_\\theta$ and DEQ. Similarly, we also experimented with applying DEQ on the fused feature (which resulted from concatenating or adding all unimodal features), which also improved the baseline accuracy to 88.3%. This result is shown in the fourth row of Table 5 with $f_{fuse}$ and DEQ. Our DEQ fusion jointly considers uni-modal and cross-modal features, leading to the most superior result of 89.1% accuracy. We conducted such ablation experiments on CMU-MOSI and MM-IMDB in Table 7 and found similar results. These experiments hopefully could demonstrate the superiority of our DEQ fusion compared with naively applying DEQ to multimodal fusion.\n\n3. We have revised the introduction according to your advice. Please see the updated paper.\n\n4. Please see 2 for the comparison.\n\nThanks again for your effort and please let us know if you have further concerns."

                        "value": "Thanks for your efforts spent on reviewing and improving our work. Please find our responses below.\n\n> Comparison against weight-tied approach.\n\nThere may be some confusion here. As mentioned in Section 2.1 of our paper, the idea of finding the equilibrium is motivated by two interesting observations, which were both claimed in [1]. They found that the hidden layers of some very deep networks tend to converge to some fixed points, and employing the same weight in each layer (so-called weight-tied) also achieves similar results. From this perspective, by applying *any weight* a large number of (or infinitely many) times, the output would eventually satisfy $z_{i+1}=f_{\\theta}(z_i)$. The advantages of applying DEQ are to accelerate the \"infinite\" forward process and memory-efficient analytical one-step backward pass.\n\nWith this in mind, please note that the memory efficiency and the acceleration of the forward process come from the fixed-point solvers and analytical backpropagation, hence are not our contributions. Instead, we focus on performing robust and generalizable multimodal fusion based on DEQ. As we show in Tables 5 and 7, naively applying DEQ to unimodal feature extractors or the fused feature leads to suboptimal results, whereas considering intra- and inter-modality features jointly (our approach) gives the best results.\n\n> 'Our fusion design is flexible from the standpoint that $f_{\\theta_i}$ can be altered arbitrarily to fit multiple modalities' -> 'Our fusion design is flexible from the standpoint that $f_{\\theta_i}$ can be altered arbitrarily to fit multiple level features'.\n\nOur original sentence is trying to express that the design of $f_{\\theta_i}$ is not unique and our design might not be optimal. One may consider altering the architecture of this module to be modality-specific to possibly further boost the performance, however, this is not our focus. Our goal instead is to propose a general framework that is applicable to most modalities and multimodal tasks. We will double check our writing to avoid such ambiguities.\n\n> When the equilibrium state is reached, why an informative unified representation in a stable feature space for multimodal learning be obtained? What is the relationship between these two?\n\nAs mentioned both in Section 1 and Appendix B in our paper, various works have suggested the importance of capturing *stable* and *higher-level* representations to enforce better cross-modality for better multimodal fusion [2,3]. The principle of DEQ fusion is that the equilibrium state of the fused feature satisfies $z_{fuse}^{(i+1)}=f(z_{fuse}^{(i)})$ (slightly simplifies the notation here). By recursively applying the fusion layer, we gradually obtain higher and higher levels of feature information. The process stabilizes at the equilibrium state, as such, the unified representation at this stage captures *stable* and *multi-level* representations.\n\nThe advantages of finding the equilibrium state to extract stable and multi-level unified representation are mainly evaluated empirically in our paper, rather than theoretically. Previous methods mostly extract finite levels of features, where the multi-level feature extractions are generally achieved by stacking multiple fusion blocks. Our experiments show that DEQ fusion outperforms these finite-level methods by a considerable margin, thus demonstrating the informativeness of the extracted feature from our DEQ fusion.\n\n> Confusion with drawings.\n\nWe would reconsider our figures along with our captions to improve the clarity.\n\n[1] Bai, Shaojie, J.

                        "value": "Thanks for your feedback and encouraging comments, please find our responses below.\n\n> Convergence and computational resources.\n\nAbout convergence, we have examined the convergence of DEQ fusion on three benchmarks, namely BRCA, MM-IMDB, and CMU-MOSI, involving various modalities in Table 8 of our paper. We found that our approach converges to a relatively small value on all three benchmarks, especially for common modalities like image, text, and audio, whereas the convergence on rarer medical-omics modalities is somewhat slower.\n\nRegarding the computational resources, we have tracked the runtime of DEQ fusion on VQA-v2, the results are 0.338 and 0.405 seconds per batch without and with DEQ fusion respectively. Since the majority of runtime comes from unimodal feature extractors, we believe that we can tolerate such inference speed to obtain higher performance.\n\n> More evaluations & related works.\n\nThanks for your suggestions. We have referred to the mentioned works in our revised paper, please find our revision in the related work (Appendix B).\n\nWe would again like to highlight that our DEQ fusion was evaluated on four widely used multimodal benchmarks, involving several different modalities, thus demonstrating strong generalizability. We will consider adding more benchmarks to further strengthen this point."
