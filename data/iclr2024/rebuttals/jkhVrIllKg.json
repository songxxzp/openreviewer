                    "value": "This paper proposes a federated learning algorithm called SABER that seeks to mitigate client drift by making each client optimize a modified local function that is the sum of the actual local function and a bias correction term like SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al., 2020) and a prox term like FedProx (Li et al., 2020a). Under second-order heterogeneity with parameter $\\delta$ (Assumption 1 in the paper), SABER is shown to converge to an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point in $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\sqrt{M} \\delta}{\\varepsilon^2})$ rounds of communication for smooth non-convex functions (the paper mistakenly reports the communication complexity as $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{M} \\delta \\varepsilon^2)$ throughout). In addition, under the $\\mu$-PL assumption, the complexity improves to $\\mathcal{O}((\\frac{\\delta}{\\mu}\\sqrt{M} + M) \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$. Empirical results on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST show the benefits of SABER compared to some baseline algorithms."

The authors have not discussed this point. *It is unreasonable to expect that $\\phi_k(w)$ can be exactly minimized* and I'd like to see a result where $w_{k+1}$ is an approximate minimizer of $\\phi_k(w)$, for e.g., an $\\varepsilon$-stationary point of $\\phi_k(w)$ as written in Section 3.1. \n\n\n**2.** Moreover, the complexity of minimizing $\\phi_k(w)$ to obtain $w_{k+1}$ has been completely ignored in Section 3.2; this is an important aspect that has not been considered. This could have been captured if there were *local steps* in the proposed algorithm; specifically, I'd find the result more convincing if there were some $H \\geq 1$ local steps of (S)GD on $\\phi_k(w)$ to *approximately minimize* it and the final convergence bound in Theorem 1 would be a function of both $K$ and $H$. \n\nI understand that the emphasis is probably on reducing the communication complexity but deriving results assuming that the local surrogate functions can be *exactly* minimized is unrealistic and too strong according to me. I'd like to see the theoretical results capture the inexactness of the approximate minimizer of $\\phi_k(w)$ as this would probably entail practically important tradeoffs.\n\n**3.** [1] and [2] (cited below) are two relevant works that have not been touched upon by this paper. Step 5 in Algorithm 1 of this paper is virtually the same as Step 4 in Algorithm 1 (PAGE) of [1]. Note that [1] is for the centralized setting. [2] proposes a federated version of PAGE called FedPAGE. *But unlike SABER, (Fed)PAGE does not need to minimize any surrogate function*. Moreover, (Fed)PAGE also attains $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{\\sqrt{M}}{\\varepsilon^{2}})$ complexity. So it appears that the algorithms proposed in [1] and [2] are similar to SABER and attain the same complexity as SABER *without* its compute-intensive part, viz., minimizing $\\phi_k(w)$. A detailed comparison of SABER with (Fed)PAGE is needed and this includes experiments.\n\n[1]: Li, Zhize, et al. \"PAGE: A simple and optimal probabilistic gradient estimator for nonconvex optimization.\" International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2021.\n\n[2]: Zhao, Haoyu, Zhize Li, and Peter Richt\u00e1rik. \"FedPAGE: A fast local stochastic gradient method for communication-efficient federated learning.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2108.04755 (2021).\n\n**4.** I also have some concerns w.r.t. the experimental results in the paper. As per Section 4.1, $p=0.5$ and 50 out of 100 clients are used in line 8 of Algorithm 2 for CIFAR-10. So 50% of the clients are used in every other round. It is not clear to me if the benefits of SABER are because of this. For FEMNIST, I could not find the total number of clients (the authors should clearly state this) but it is mentioned that 100 clients are used in line 8 of Algorithm 2 again with $p = 0.5$. Anyway, I think $p = 0.5$ is too large and the algorithm is practically useful only if it works with much smaller values of $p$ such as 0.1, etc. I'd like to see an ablation study showing the effect of varying $p$. Also, it is not clear to me if the hyper-parameters were tuned for the other algorithms. Finally, as I mentioned in point #3, there should be some empirical comparisons with FedPAGE too given its similarity to SABER.\n\nDue to the above weaknesses, I can only give a score of 3 for now."

                        "value": "Thank you for providing your feedback on our submission. \n1. It appears to us that the main concern comes from solving the local subproblem, so we answer it here in detail. The definition $w_{k+1}\\approx \\arg\\min_w \\phi_k(w)$ requires two things that are used in the proof: 1) descent in the local objective, $\\phi_k(w_{k+1}) \\le \\phi_k(w_k) - \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\Vert w_{k+1} - w_k\\Vert^2$ (used in the proof of Lemma 1), and 2) $\\Vert\\nabla \\phi_k(w_{k+1})\\Vert\\le \\varepsilon$ (used in the proof of Lemma 3). Both conditions can be achieved by applying gradient descent to $\\phi_k(w)$. As is known for nonconvex functions, it will take $H=O(\\varepsilon^{-2})$ iterations to satisfy both conditions.\n2. Thank you for providing additional references. We have cited SARAH, Spider, and EF21 for the use of recursive updates, but we see that PAGE uses the same mechanism too. As for the complexity of SABER and FedPAGE, the key difference is that the latter operates under $L$-smoothness of the problem. As discussed in prior work on second-order heterogeneity, for instance by Khaled & Jin (2023), $L$-smoothness implies second-order heterogeneity with constant $\\delta = 2L$, but the reverse is not true. In other words, second-order heterogeneity is strictly more general and $\\delta$ can be orders of magnitude smaller than $L$. Moreover, as far as we can see, if we apply PAGE to the local subproblem of SABER without regularization, then we immediately recover FedPAGE as a special case.\n3. We will update the experiments for the camera-ready version to add FedPAGE as a baseline as the reviewer requested. We tried to do it before the end of the discussion period, but couldn't due to the short discussion period and since the FedPAGE paper doesn't provide code. \n4. Regarding the hyperparameter search, we tuned the hyperparameters for all methods, not just ours."

The proof of Lemma 3 in the current version still assumes $\\nabla \\phi_k(w_{k+1}) = 0$, i.e., $\\phi_k$ needs to be exactly minimized. I had suggested the authors show a result where $\\phi_k$ is approximately minimized, but that has not been done.\n\n2. Overall, there don't appear to be any meaningful differences or improvements over FedPAGE. Unless there are any major challenges in deriving results under second-order heterogeneity compared to $L$-smoothness, I don't think this is significant enough.\n\n3. My concern about large values of $p$ (in Weakness #4) has not been addressed.\n\nI will keep my score."

Partial participation. Authors claim that SABER allows for partial participation (PP). As far as I understand, SABER with PP is listed as Algorithm 2. However, theoretical analysis is only presented for Algorithm 1, where participation of all clients is necessary, consequently relegating Algorithm 2 to a heuristic approach.\n3. The experiments were conducted with a single local step for all methods.

As the reviewer correctly pointed out, gradient descent would require $\\epsilon^{-2}$ iterations to find the $\\epsilon$-stationary point of the local objective. This is, however, expected since employing GD makes it a method from the first-order class, for which there exist a lot of lower bounds. Woodworth et al. (2023) studied a method similar to ours in non-federated context, and the complexity improvement was in having the smoothness constant replaced by the heterogeneity constant, while in terms of $\\epsilon$, it remained the same.\n2. Partial participation is indeed an important feature of our method, but it actually is supported by both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2. Notice step 4 in Algorithm 1, where we select a single client that will be used to perform the update.\n3. To clarify, the clients perform a single local *epoch*, which is not the same as performing a single local *step*. Each epoch includes multiple local steps as the clients go over the dataset during the epoch.\n4. Thanks for pointing out the typo in the abstract, we also found similar typos in the text, and fixed all of them.\n5. Thank you for the suggestion, you are right that it is not necessary to find the actual argmin. We will make it clear in the paper."

In Algorithm 1, during step 4, you calculate the full gradient with a probability of $p$, involving all workers. Could you clarify why this is considered a method with partial participation, given that it requires the involvement of all clients by design?\n3.

                        "value": "Thank you for your positive feedback! We address the pointed weaknesses and answer the questions below in a combined list.\n1. Thank you for asking about the stateless nature, it is an important feature of our method and it seems we forgot to properly define it when first mentioning it. Concretely, we assume that the clients do not carry states from round to round. For example, they may randomly drop out and never come back again.\n2. Issues such as node errors, communication drop-outs, and stragglers that the reviewer mentions are indeed common in federated learning. The proximal term (regularization) used in the subproblem of SABER was originally motivated in FedProx to mitigate the issue of stragglers. For example, when one client does much more work than the others, the update magnitude is still limited thanks to the regularization. We will add a  discussion on the consequences of using regularization in the paper.\n3. Similarly, when the clients have different dataset sizes, the standard technique is to sample clients with a non-uniform sampling. All of our techniques are orthogonal and directly applicable to that case too.\n4. We used the standard ICLR template but we split the pdf into the main body and the supplementary and this seems to have affected the text. We will split the pdf differently to fix the issue.\n5. We apologize for not including the code in the submission, we were working hard on the manuscript and didn\u2019t find enough time to clean the code to be included.\n6. If a client drops during computation, the fact that our theory works under second-order heterogeneity implies that there should be no bias as long as we can sometimes get an update from that client to maintain a meaningful estimate of the global direction $v_k$. In other words, the penalty for the client dropping is that the update would be less useful, but it will still be unbiased.\n7. If some clients dominate the training in terms of how much work they can do, this issue is already handled using the regularization term. If you mean that they dominate in terms of participation, then the required change would be to sample them less frequently. We can add a discussion on how the theory works in this case."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their feedback. \n1. As the reviewer pointed out, the local objective construction is intuitive and is similar to SCAFFOLD and FedProx, but we believe this is a positive feature. Not only it connects naturally to the existing literature, it also lets us intuitively explain the meaning of every term in the subproblem. Note that constructing the subproblem itself was never supposed to be the main contribution, it\u2019s rather in the analysis of the method. Moreover, the analysis of our paper doesn\u2019t have anything in common neither with SCAFFOLD nor with FedProx.\n2. Even if there are similarities with SVRG, our analysis is not based on it, so we are not sure why it is seen as a weakness by the reviewer. Furthermore, unlike SVRG, our algorithm does not store an anchoring point that is reset in the outer loop.\n3. We would like to point out some key differences between our method and SVRS, as well as their analyses. First of all, unlike SVRS, SABER does not use $f_1$ at every iteration of the algorithm. In terms of analysis, starting from Lemma D.1 of Lin et. al, one can notice the term $D_h(x, x_t)$. Then, in the proof of Theorem 3.3, in Appendix D.2, they set $x=x_*$, where $x_*$ is the optimal solution. Our theory, in contrast, never uses the optimal solution, which might not even since we don't assume convexity. Likewise, we never use the distance term from the SVRS theory, so there are considerable differences in the proofs.\n4. We are happy to rewrite Section 3.3 to improve the structure."
