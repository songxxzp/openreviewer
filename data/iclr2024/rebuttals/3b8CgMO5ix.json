The proposed unrolled LRP for benefits from having layer-wise guidance from the heatmaps with the skip and tied-in connections for accurate segmentation map prediction. However, it remains somewhat unclear whether this directly leads to improved segmentation performance, as indicated by the authors. It might be the case that the segmentation results are more closely tied to the quality of the heatmaps. Nevertheless, I feel that the idea is novel and is of sufficient interest to the research community.\n- The paper makes use of standard training objectives with the proposed unrolled LRP for semi-supervised segmentation, thereby making it directly usable with any task specific architectures. In general, I am in favour of simple and easy to plug-in methods that can complement already existing approaches.\n- The proposed method is well supported by experiment results. The empirical finding that concurrent training for classification and segmentation does not compromise classifier performance and holds up comparably to conventional segmentation architectures is quite intriguing. This finding suggests that the method is more generalizable to classification as well as segmentation."

As you state, multiple factors contribute to heatmap quality, among which (1) class imbalance, (2) many diverse semantic classes and/or instances per image, and (3) confounders (with Clever-Hans in ImageNet among the most well-studied). The \u201cRight for the Right Reason\u201d community has extensively shown that issue (3) can be mitigated via losses on heatmaps, and thus we hypothesize this to be the case also for our segmentation loss. However, (1) and (2) also affect the performance of standard segmentation networks. Here, a range of methodology has been proposed to mitigate this effect, e.g. via image- and pixel sampling strategies tailored to counter detrimental effects of high class imbalance. Consequently, to us, an extremely interesting question for further study appears to be: Are there circumstances under which standard segmentation networks (together with their mitigation methodology) *are* able to handle a challenging situation, whereas unrolled heatmap segmentation architectures (with same mitigation methodology) *are not*? So far, vaguely speaking, our results suggest that unrolled LRP behaves \u201csimilar enough\u201d to UNets that we would not expect any \u201csurprises\u201d regarding inferior performance in specific situations. E.g., we expect class imbalance treatment as e.g. in Araslanov et al. (2021) to have a similar-sized positive effect no matter if standard- or unrolled heatmap segmentation architectures are employed. However, substantiating this hypothesis via further studies is a very interesting direction, and we will add a respective discussion to the Discussion Section of the paper. \n\nRe \u201cWould the losses from orthogonal semi-supervised segmentation approaches affect the training with an unrolled LRP?\u201d \\\nAlong the same lines of reasoning as above, we expect improvements by means of orthogonal semi-supervised approaches (like e.g. augmentation consistency training) to be of sizes comparable to respective improvements for standard segmentation networks. As above, this hypothesis needs to be substantiated in further studies.\n\nRe \u201cThere is no code currently available, will the authors make it available at some point?\u201d \\\nYes, all code will be made available upon publication of the manuscript."
