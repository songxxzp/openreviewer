In this way, the LISA could contain both LLM's reasoning ability and the SAM's segmentation ability.\n- The usage of LoRA could help the model to achieve good performance with a limited training dataset and computation source, which brings light for most labs in the community.\n- Extensive experiments and good performance. \n- The authors gave details wrt the implementation details, especially the promotes used to diversity the datasets, which brings some insightful knowledge to the community."

However, where comes the number? Would the performance get further boosted with more data samples?\n\n- Some direct while simple comparison is needed: how about just using Grounding-SAM, the combination of Grounding-DINO with SAM? What would be the strengths of the LISA.\n\n- Some writing is unclear, for example, I noticed many tables contain the items with \"(ft)\" while they seem to have different meanings.\n\n- Currently, only one segmentation instance can be obtained during inference. Also, it is reasonable due to the limited dataset source, could the author demonstrate the potential scalability."

If not used, how to align the feature channels?\n\n- Will more dataset sample, rather than 239 samples help the final results?\n\n- Could the proposed methods be easily adapted to other domains, like remote sensing, etc?\n\n- Since the QA pair is not that hard, I am wondering would the classic T5 / Bert achieve a similar performance?\n\n- I am afraid that the claims \"Remarkably, LISA can handle cases involving: 1) complex reasoning; 2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; 4) multi-turn conversation.\" need more experiments to support them.

Similar to the existing task \"Referring Expression Segmentation\" (RES), the new task requires a model to take in a free-form natural language description and a reference image, then output a desirable segmentation mask as required by the language input. The main difference between the two is that the language input in ReasonSeg is longer and less restrictive compared to RES. The authors also proposed LISA, leveraging existing multimodal LLMs with added trainable layers and special token <SEG> to achieve the ability required by Reasoning Segmentation. LISA is trained on multiple datasets adapted from Semantic Segmentations, VQA, RES tasks, and a new set of annotated image-instruction reasoning segmentation pairs. The proposed model LISA performes well on ReasonSeg as well as RES."

The proposed pipeline LISA is a straightforward and effective solution in adapting existing models and datasets to achieve the challenging ReasonSeg task with reasonable training requirements. \n3.

Although the new task ReasonSeg is well motivated, (which requires two key capabilities: 1. long text understanding and 2. segmentation), LISA's capabilities are not fully motivated and evaluated. As described by the author: \"LISA can handle various scenarios, including 1) complex reasoning; 2) world knowledge; 3) explanatory answers; and 4) multi-turn conversations.\", however, this paper mainly evaluates LISA's capability in segmentation with complex reasoning via ReasonSeg and RES benchmarks. Capabilities 2,3,4 (especially 3,4) on LISA are not required by the task ReasonSeg. Would a model similar to LISA but with segmentation output only perform better? \n3. Referring to the templates used (Section A. 1) in adapting the existing datasets, if the goal is to preserve the conversational ability (which is not motivated well), why not use LLMs to rephrase these templates? If the goal is to achieve ReasonSeg only, why not output the <SEG> only? \n4. The scale of the new dataset ReasonSeg is relatively small. It would be much more helpful to the community if the dataset is bigger, and the following works can keep on researching the 4 capabilities mentioned but not quite investigated."

It also demonstrates robust zero-shot capability when trained on reasoning-free datasets. \n\nIn summary, this work offers a model that can comprehend complex and implicit queries to generate segmentation masks effectively.
