                    "value": "Quality of the result from LLMs is excessively dependent on the input prompt. Providing the right set of example as demonstrations helps boost the performance significantly.\n\nBut due to the limitation on the context length, one needs to limit the number of examples that can be provided to the model as demonstrations. The paper presents an algorithm to select the right set of examples as demonstrations to the model that can achieve the better than some of the commonly used methodologies.\n\nThe effectiveness of the methodology is supported by experiments that show that just by selecting the right set of examples, the model can significantly improve performance on various tasks.\n\nThe paper additionally proposes to extend this to finetuning. Essentially, train the model on only a subset of high quality examples instead of all train examples. Results in the finetuning setup are also encouraging."

Consequently, it extracts a concise set of highly informative samples from a given training dataset. Designed for both in-context learning and fine-tuning scenarios, empirical tests across multiple datasets and LLMs confirm FEEDER's efficacy as a pre-filter, reducing the size of the training data while either preserving or enhancing the model's performance."

Despite empirical evidence supporting FEEDER's value as a pre-filtering algorithm, the paper does not provide a direct comparison with existing state-of-the-art demonstration selection methodologies. As indicated in Table 1, when FEEDER is used solely (i.e., comparing D_FEED + RAN to D_TRAIN + SIM or D_TRAIN + DIV), it often underperforms relative to other methods. Furthermore, FEEDER's marginal or even negative enhancements as a pre-filter to SIM and DIV, coupled with its computational demands, might render SIM and DIV more favorable options due to their efficiency and simplicity.\n2. The research primarily focuses on text classification datasets. Given that one of the LLM's standout features is its reasoning and generation capabilities, it remains uncertain how well FEEDER would adapt to tasks or domains beyond text classification."

Given that demonstrations are typically restricted to a specific count (e.g., 5 or 10), is there scope to refine the algorithm to pinpoint, for instance, the top-5 or top-10 most informative samples?\n2. Since the search algorithm aims to optimize training data performance, could this potentially lead to overfitting? Would integrating a validation set serve as a solution against such overfitting?"
