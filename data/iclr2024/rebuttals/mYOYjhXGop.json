This work not only performs self-supervised segmentation accurately without relying on pixel-level annotations but also provides explainability, which is lacking in most of the deep learning models. The proposed method efficiently segregates class-related features from class-unrelated features within the samples. It then generates new samples that maintain identity features while modifying class attributes by embedding diverse class-related features. To achieve this, authors employ topological data analysis to project the extracted class-related features onto a globally interpretable class-related manifold."

Machine-based tumor segmentation can assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning techniques offer potential for feature representation in brain tumor segmentation but often require a large number of samples with pixel-level annotations, and they lack interpretability. The paper addresses these challenges by introducing a framework that separates class-related features from class-unrelated ones. This approach reduces the need for pixel-level annotations, making it more practical for clinical settings. To improve interpretability, the authors use topological data analysis to project class-related features into a globally explainable manifold. This adds a layer of explanation to the model. The method is validated on two distinct datasets and shows improved performance in brain tumor segmentation, contributing to both machine learning and medical imaging."

Do you need more than two images in a pair? Do you need to generate all possible counterfactuals?\n- Analysis of the approach on other datasets would be really helpful\n- Similar approaches like in anomaly detection literature are not discussed; refer [1, 2]\n- Presentation concerns: move all the related works into the related work section rather than including them in the methods section, which makes it hard to follow the contribution.\n\n\n[1] Chaitanya, K., Erdil, E., Karani, N. and Konukoglu, E., 2020.
