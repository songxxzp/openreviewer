We believe there are a few misconceptions that we address below:\n\n> **\u201cThe idea of multi-step SAM is not new and has been explored before\u201d**\n\nThe primary aim of our work is not to introduce the concept of multiple ascent step SAM, but rather  to make it work well in practice. By enhancing SAM\u2019s maximization and minimization steps, our approach demonstrated significant performance improvements over vanilla SAM and ASAM, as well as additional baseline methods.\n\n> **\u201cAlthough the interpolation step makes this work different from the previous work, I think that is a marginal contribution.\u201d**\n\nBeyond (gradient combination and)  linear interpolation, we also introduce a mechanism to analytically control $\\alpha$ during training (**Section 6**). By considering the angle between the first gathered gradient and the final update direction, we successfully remove the need to finetune $\\alpha$, while maintaining performance. We show that our method leads to improved performance in a myriad of tasks: generalization performance, model robustness, and lifelong learning. We believe these contributions are substantial rather than marginal.\n\n> **\u201cThe complete ImageNet should be in the numerical studies\u201d**\n\nWe want to clarify that our experiments used ImageNet-1k with an image size of 224x224, following common practice in the literature. We added this clarification in **Appendix A.3** in the manuscript.\n\n> **\u201cTransformer-based models need to be added\u201d**\n\nSAM has been successfully applied to Transformers [1] and we should expect Lookbehind to further improve SAM\u2019s performance, as presented throughout our paper. While we understand the current desire to use Transformers in the community, we do not think this is a critical issue with our manuscript that warrants a reason for rejection.\n\n[1] Chen et al.

                    "value": "1. My first concern may be the title this paper, \"Lookbehind Optimizer: k steps back, 1 step forward\". The title obviously mimics the paper \"Lookahead Optimizer: k steps forward, 1 step back\". This somehow directly implies that the method of the presented paper is opposite to that in Lookahead paper. But they are very different. The proposed Lookbehind could not be used without SAM, and focusing on different gradients. Considering the proposed method contributes specifically to SAM, so at least, the paper ought to mention SAM algorithm in their title to give a clear view, such as Lookbehind SAM Optimizer or Lookbehind SAM. Not mentioning SAM in the title is unacceptable.\n\n2. The motivation is not quite clear for me. The authors claim that the proposed method could reduce the variance derived from the multiple ascent steps. Why we need to reduce such variance is not clearly demonstrated. \n\n3. Although the proposed method seems interesting, yet its drawback is quite obvious. A single parameter update requires performing multiple backwards propagation to calculate the ascent gradient. In other words, the utility efficiency of training samples is quite low. Multiple backwards propagations are required on the same sample batch. Given that the improvement of the proposed method is marginal, the side effect of such a method can potentially be substantial. So, in my opinion, the proposed method may not be better than the vanilla SAM.\n\n4. Based on my tuning experience, the authors have not trained the models to achieve comparable results when using vanilla SAM in their baseline on Cifar dataset. The authors should at least trained models to achieve comparable results with those reported in the original SAM paper. For example, in the original SAM paper, WRN-28-10 can achieve an error rate of 16.5 with SAM, while in the given paper, it achieves an error rate of 19.5 with SAM, almost 3 percentage gap. Therefore, the reported results can not fully persuade me that their method is more effective. Also, many advanced SAM variants have not mentioned in their experiments. It is highly recommended that the authors make comparisons with these SOTA methods.\n\n5. For Figure 2, it is recommended that the authors draw some marks with respect to the gradient vector.\n\n6. For Algm 1, it is recommended that the authors use $\\theta$ to substitute fast weights $\\phi$, as that used in the Lookahead paper."

Below we explain how we address the reviewer\u2019s concerns. \n\n>  **\u201cThe paper ought to mention SAM algorithm in their title to give a clear view, such as Lookbehind SAM Optimizer or Lookbehind SAM.\u201d**\n\nThank you for bringing attention to this oversight. Initially, our choice of title was influenced by the parallel with Lookahead, aiming for consistency in titles. However, we acknowledge the merit of including SAM explicitly for a clearer representation of the paper's content. In response to this valuable feedback, we have updated the title to **\"Lookbehind-SAM: k steps back, 1 step forward.\"** This modification aims to maintain brevity while ensuring a direct connection with the SAM algorithm. We appreciate the suggestion and believe this title better conveys the essence of our work.\n\n> **\u201cThe authors claim that the proposed method could reduce the variance derived from the multiple ascent steps. Why we need to reduce such variance is not clearly demonstrated.\u201d**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for this opportunity to clarify this important point. In the context of Multistep-SAM, the objective is to enhance the solution of the maximization part of SAM\u2019s objective. However, the substantial departure of the gradient collected far away from the original point can adversely impact the original minimization objective, resulting in a suboptimal loss-sharpness trade-off, as illustrated in **Figure 1**.\n\nLookbehind addresses this issue by collecting and combining gradients along the ascent step, effectively reducing the variance of these gradients. This reduction in variance contributes to an improved loss-sharpness trade-off, ultimately leading to enhanced performance. We have incorporated additional explanations and clarifications in **Section 3** of the manuscript to further elucidate this critical aspect. We hope this provides a clearer understanding of the motivation behind our approach.\n\n> **\u201cA single parameter update requires performing multiple backwards propagation to calculate the ascent gradient. In other words, the utility efficiency of training samples is quite low\u201d**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer\u2019s concern about the increased computational overhead associated with multiple backwards propagation for a single parameter update, which in fact applies to any Multistep Sam method. Note that Lookbehind entails the same number of gradient computations as Multistep-SAM/ASAM, yet consistently surpasses the latter in performance. Through this lens, although the utility efficiency of training samples is the same for both methods, the utility efficacy is higher with Lookbehind.\n\n> **\u201cthe authors have not trained the models to achieve comparable results when using vanilla SAM in their baseline on Cifar dataset.\u201d**\n\nWe appreciate your concern about the strength of the baselines and have taken steps to address it. We conducted additional experiments in line with the training setup from ASAM's paper [1], by applying a cosine learning rate scheduler and label smoothing to WRN-28-10 trained on CIFAR-100. The results, detailed in **Appendix A.8 (Table 8)**, demonstrate that Lookbehind achieves an error rate of $16.28$ and $16.00$ for SAM and ASAM, respectively. These performances convincingly outperform the error rates of $16.58$ and $16.32$ reported for vanilla SAM and ASAM in [1]. We hope these additional results provide a more robust basis for comparison.\n\n[1] Kwon et al. ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of Deep Neural Networks.

It\u2019s important to note that Lookbehind is a versatile wrapper that can be used with any SAM variant.

Our paper contributes to the active research on multiple ascent-step SAM, focusing on addressing the performance challenge arising from a poor sharpness-loss tradeoff. In response to the reviewer\u2019s feedback, we\u2019ve added a note in the conclusion, underscoring the importance of exploring the computational efficiency of multistep SAM. \n\nWhile testing Lookbehind with a broader range of SAM variants is an interesting suggestion,  it\u2019s crucial to note that Lookbehind is not just a new SAM variant. Instead, it serves as a versatile wrapper applicable to any sharpness-aware minimization method, aiming to enhance their sharpness-loss tradeoff.  We firmly believe our results highlight the effectiveness of  Lookbehind in this context."

We also thank the reviewer for their questions and concrete suggestions to clarify our contribution and to improve both  the content and presentation.\n\n> **\u201cCan the authors compare Lookbehind against averaging the ascent gradients baseline ?\u201d**\n\nThank you for this suggestion. We have added additional comparisons between Lookbehind and Multistep-SAM/ASAM with averaging the ascent gradients. Results are shown in **Appendix A7 (Table 7)** of the updated manuscript. We observe that despite showing some improvements over Multistep-SAM/ASAM, both variants of Lookbehind (with and without adaptive $\\alpha$) outperform these baselines.\n\n> **\u201cMore detailed descriptions are needed for Figure 2 and Figure 11.\u201d**\n\nThank you for pointing this out. We added a detailed description of Figure 11 and presented the key differences between Figures 2 and 11 in **Appendix A.2**.\n\n> **\u201cThe decay term can be omitted for simplification.\u201d**\n\nThank you for this suggestion. We removed the decay term from all equations and kept the mention of using weight decay in **Appendix A.3** where we describe the training details.\n\n> **\u201cWhile leveraging multiple ascent steps can improve over the original SAM/ASAM, a prior study [2] shows that the inner gradient ascent can be calculated periodically while maintaining similar performance to the conventional SAM (i.e. it is redundant to compute the ascent gradient at every step). Can the author elaborate more on this?\u201d**\n\nLookbehind is a general wrapper for any sharpness-aware minimization method. Therefore, more efficient SAM variants such as re-using the inner gradient ascent steps are orthogonal to our work and may be used together to improve training efficiency.\n\n> **\u201cCan the authors compare Lookbehind against SAM/ASAM at different training budgets?\u201d**\n\nWe understand and share the reviewer\u2019s concern. Indeed, we already briefly discuss this in **Appendix A.1.1**, where we study the average number of epochs at which SAM and ASAM reach top validation performance. Our findings suggest that increasing training time would not be a viable way to further improve performance in our setup. \n\nIn response to the reviewer\u2019s recommendation,  we conducted additional experiments by replicating the ASAM setup. We trained a WRN-28-10 model on CIFAR-100 using SAM and ASAM for an extended period of  400 epochs instead of 200. The results, detailed in Appendix A.8, Table 8, show that the 400-epoch models achieved similar generalization performance compared to the original 200 epochs. Specifically, SAM and ASAM attained  $83.37_{\\pm .12}$ and $83.67_{\\pm .12}$ validation accuracy at an average epoch of $194.8_{\\pm 2.78}$ and $202.8_{\\pm 8.23}$, respectively. This supports our earlier observation that the models\u2019 generalization performance was already saturated by the original 200 epochs. We hope this additional analysis addresses the reviewer\u2019s concern."

We address specific questions below:\n\n> **\u201cCan the fast weights (updated in line 8 of Algorithm 1) be approximately updated using any standard optimization algorithm like SGD or Adam?\u201d**\n\nThank you for this important question. Yes, the fast weights updated in line 8 of Algorithm 1 can be approximately updated using standard optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam. \n Lookbehind is a wrapper for sharpness-aware minimization methods, and these, in turn,  are a wrapper for standard optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam. Although SAM and ASAM have been primarily used with SGD, both methods have also been successfully combined with Adam, showing improvements over vanilla Adam [1].\n\n[1] Kwon et al. ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of Deep Neural Networks. ICML 2021.\n\n> **\u201cWhy not conduct an analysis of the sensitivity of Lookbehind to the step size of the fast weights?\u201d**\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion regarding the analysis of Lookbehind's sensitivity to the step size of the fast weights. However, we maintain a consistent inner learning rate for all methods. In the context of our specific method, the influence of the inner step size can be managed through the parameter $\\alpha$, which can be considered as compensation for variations in the learning rate applied to the fast weights.\n\n\n> **\u201cWhat is the relation between Lookbehind and Anderson acceleration?\u201d**\n\n\nThank you for bringing up this interesting question. As far as we understand, the goals of Lookbehind and Anderson acceleration appear to be distinct. Anderson acceleration is typically employed as a convergence acceleration method, whereas Lookbehind serves as a variance-reduction method, enhancing the efficiency of the maximization and minimization components of SAM\u2019s objective. However, we acknowledge that we were not familiar with Anderson acceleration before this discussion and are open to further conversations on this topic.\n\n**Minor fixes**: We changed the text where appropriate to address your comments - thank you for your corrections."
