                    "value": "The authors propose a layer-based diffusion generation paradigm that enables multiple-layer image and mask generation in the diffusion process, leading to greater flexibility and control over the synthesized results. Specifically, an image is divided into one background layer and several foreground layers, each containing one foreground element. With a layer-specific prompt enhancer and a layer-collaborative diffusion model with specially designed inter-layer and intra-layer attention modules, the model is able to generate images and masks of multiple layers. A large-scale dataset with multi-layer images and layer-specific prompts is synthesized for training."

Though it is only capable of two-layered compositions, I think it is necessary to compare the two-layered results of the proposed method with this previous work.\n- Missing ablation study on the Layer-Collaborative Attention Block.\n\n[1 ]Xinyang Zhang, Wentian Zhao, Xin Lu, and Jeff Chien.

The authors might consider more challenging scenarios that align with the nature of layer-composable image synthesis like object-specific editing in multi-object images or complex compositions to demonstrate the superiority over Stable Diffusion.\n- It is mentioned in section 3.1.1 that \"There is no overlap between the foreground images and foreground masks, respectively\". How is this guaranteed in the generation process? Also in 3.1.1, it says \"Those foreground pairs are arranged along the depth information so that they can be stacked from top to bottom and overlaid onto the background image to compose an entire image.\" However, if the masks are non-overlapping, why does the order matter? And how to get such depth information?"

Some pipeline details are not elaborated clearly, please see my questions below.\n3. Limited technical novelty: The overall framework seems more like an integration of multiple existing techniques. Although there are some original modules (e.g., inter-layer attention module), I still find their technical contributions relatively limited."

If so, how do the noisy mask guide layer-specific synthesize at initial denoising stages, when the mask information is unclear?\n3. For the inter-layer attention module, what is the input? For \"layer hidden states\" mentioned in Section 3.2.2, does it refer to intermediate noise output by the UNet? If so, how do the communication between cross-layer intermdiate noise help with the coherence and harmony across layers?\n4. Could you provide experimental proof to showcase the usefulness of inter-layer attention module? For example, how can it help with enhanced coherence across layers."
