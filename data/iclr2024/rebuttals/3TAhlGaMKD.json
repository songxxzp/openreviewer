                        "value": "> Regarding Prompt injection attacks\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that prompt injection attacks are a current threat. However, our focus is on the fine-tuning scenario. The prompt injection attacks, however, are more closely associated with the vulnerabilities of Language Model Models (LLMs) rather than the fine-tuning techniques themselves. Existing models have been demonstrated to be susceptible to such attacks, and as of now, there are no established successful defenses against them. The fine-tuning techniques we currently employ are tailored for benign tasks and are not directly related to mitigating prompt injection attacks. Nevertheless, it would indeed be intriguing to investigate whether these fine-tuning methods could potentially increase or decrease the models' vulnerability to such attacks. We aim to explore this in future research.\n\n> Regarding PII leakage\n\nWe acknowledge the significance of these PII leakage attacks and agree that they are indeed interesting. However, we would like to point out that the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) represents the most basic form of privacy attack. As such, it provides an overview of more sophisticated attacks and is even shown to imply different privacy attacks[1]. Similarly, current works analyzing the differential privacy guarantee use MIA only and not the other different privacy attacks[2,3].\n For example, if a technique, like In-Context Learning (ICL), is more vulnerable to MIA, then it is likely to be more vulnerable to other forms of vulnerabilities, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) leakage, compared to methods like LoRA and SPT.\n\n[1] SoK: Let the Privacy Games Begin! A Unified Treatment of Data Inference Privacy in Machine Learning\n\n[2] Bayesian Estimation of Differential Privacy\n\n[3] Adversary instantiation: Lower bounds for differentially private machine learning\n\n> While conducting the MIA, the classification is done based on loss function value. So is the assumption that the adversary knows the correct loss function?\n\nWe do not make any assumption on the correct loss function. Our approach simply requires that the model generates a list of candidate words along with their respective probabilities for a given test sample. This allows the attacker to compute the loss using their chosen loss function, based on the provided information, without the need to know the loss function utilized internally by the model.\n\n> Also, what significance does the loss function value have for ICL exemplars? For LoRA and SPT, the LLM has learned to minimize loss on member exemplars, but I do not know what relationship the ICL samples have with the loss function value.\n\nIt seems there may be a bit of a misunderstanding regarding our approach. In the context of the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), the calculation of the loss occurs exclusively during the testing phase. The focus is on assessing the loss during the model's testing, which allows us to infer membership status (without depending on the loss function used in training).\n\nShould there be any need for further clarification, or if our understanding of your question has missed the mark, please let us know.\n\n> In section 3.2, it is not clear what is meant by the sentence \"Subsequently, we calibrate the hyperparameters of LoRA and SPT to align their performance with that of ICL.\" What exactly are the steps taken to ensure that the comparison of these methods is apples-to-apples? How can adding, say, 4 ICL examples be equated to performing LoRA with hundreds of training samples?\n\nOur calibration process is designed to evaluate the privacy and security risks of different methods when they exhibit comparable performance.\n\nTo establish this equivalence, we concentrate on accuracy. For LoRA and SPT, we carefully modify the number of training samples to match their accuracy levels with that of In-Context Learning (ICL) for the same task. This approach ensures that we compare the privacy and security impacts associated with these different adaptation methods at similar or identical levels of accuracy. We will clarify this in our paper.\n\n> In the model stealing, the success of the attack is quantified by a certain \"agreement\" score between the target model and a surrogate model. Can the authors please define what this metric exactly is, as it is not available anywhere.\n\nWe introduce the agreement score in Section 4.2. Intuitively, this metric compares the outputs generated by the target and surrogate models for each sample. A 'success' is registered when the outputs from both models are similar, regardless of whether these outputs are correct or not. The agreement score is subsequently calculated as the ratio of successful matches to the total number of samples in the testing dataset."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer again for their feedback and would like to ask if there is anything else that requires clarification. As previously mentioned, membership inference attack is the most common and fundamental privacy attack, which other more advanced attacks, such as reconstruction attacks, can be built upon. Therefore, if a model is secure against membership inference attacks, it is also secure against reconstruction attacks. Regarding other security attacks, such as prompt injection attacks or jailbreaks, there are so far no peer-reviewed papers available, and the arXiv ones require large LLMs that may not be applicable to some of the models we studied in this work. Nonetheless, we agree that this is an interesting direction that we would like to explore further in future research."

In the experimental evaluation, Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), Soft Prompt Tuning (SPT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) are evaluated against these three types of attacks. The results show that not every fine-tuning method is equally susceptible to all three attacks. For example, while ICL is mostly resilient against backdoor attacks, membership inference attacks are very successful against models fine-tuned using ICL. Overall, it seems that each of these fine-tuning methods have their pros and cons regarding the susceptibility to security and privacy attacks. The paper raises awareness of these risks when using these fine-tuning methods."

This allows the reader to quickly see how effective the backdoor attack is.\n- With the limited context length of the LLMs it is hard to make a definitive conclusion about the susceptibility of ICL to membership inference attacks. There seems to be a trend that increasing the number of given examples reduces the susceptibility.

                        "value": "> For the backdoor attacks, it would be nice to draw the baseline of random guessing into the attack success rate plots (Fig. 8 and Fig. 10). This allows the reader to quickly see how effective the backdoor attack is.\n\nThanks for the suggestion. We have updated the revised version accordingly.\n\n> Q1: How was the membership inference attack on ICL performed? And was the whole prompt/all of the given examples considered as the \"member\" here?\n\nWe consider each example within the prompt to be treated as a distinct member. During the membership inference attack, we input each tested sample into the language model and leverage the loss to ascertain its membership status. We will clarify this in the paper.\n\n> Q2: What are the accuracies of the original fine-tuned models using ICL, SPT, and LoRA on the different datasets?\n\nIn our settings, we adjust the size of the training dataset such that different adaptation methods demonstrate similar performance. We have included the accuracy in our updated paper.\n\n> Q3: Could you provide experimental results for backdoor attacks with different target labels other than the label 0?\n\nThis is an interesting idea, we will run this experiment in the following days.\n\n> Q4: \"We do not replace clean samples but concatenate the fine-tuning dataset with the backdoored one\" -> Does this mean that samples are present twice in the fine-tuning dataset? Once with the backdoor trigger and once without the backdoor trigger?\n\nIndeed, your interpretation is correct. Our decision is tailored to the constraints of In-Context Learning (ICL), which can handle only a limited number of demonstrations. By strategically including a mix of both clean and poisoned samples, our goal is to minimize potential confusion for the language model during its training process, thereby enhancing its performance.\n\n> Q5: Why is the standard deviation of the backdoor attacks so high?\n\nTo align the performance of LoRA and SPT with that of ICL, we limit the number of training samples. Consequently, the selection and poisoning of the training dataset introduce a notable degree of randomness, significantly impacting final performance outcomes.\n\nTo mitigate this variability and guarantee the reliability of our results, we have conducted each experiment ten times. This approach helps to provide a more representative average performance across the experiments."

                        "value": "> Recent and more advanced attacks like LiRA should be used.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion to incorporate LiRA into our study, given its strong performance in MIA. However, its application seems impractical for the language Model Models (LLMs), particularly due to the computational constraints of training **tens of thousands** of shadow models. In fact, extending LiRA to large-scale LLMs is substantial enough to be its own paper. We encourage a closer examination of the model sizes used in our study compared to those in LiRA's research. Conducting such experiments on large LLMs requires a budget that is beyond the reach of many, a point underscored by **even industry giants like Google, who prefer simpler models like ResNet-9 for their quick training capabilities and computational efficiency [1]**.\n\nMoreover, while the attack method used in our paper may be simple, it significantly reveals membership status vulnerabilities in the ICL. This finding should prompt users considering ICL to weigh their options more carefully. Employing more advanced attacks, in this context, would likely yield no further insights.\n\n[1] Students Parrot Their Teachers: Membership Inference on Model Distillation\n\n> Similarly recent model stealing and backdoor attacks are not evaluated in the paper.\n\nWe wish to emphasize that the focus of recent model stealing attacks[2][3][4], is primarily on executing these attacks under more constrained conditions, such as limited knowledge of dataset distribution or access only to hard-label predictions. In contrast, our approach provides the attacker with the most extensive information possible, offering an upper-bound assessment of the model's susceptibility to stealing.\n\nFor backdoor attacks, due to the nature of in-context learning, there are limited operations we can do except poisoning the demonstrations. Therefore, we are curious about the specific types of attacks the reviewer envisions, so we can evaluate their feasibility in our context.\n\nLastly, it's important to acknowledge our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and promoting green computing. In line with this commitment, we aim to minimize unnecessary experiments. By simulating scenarios where the adversary is given optimal conditions, we focus our efforts on safeguarding against the most severe potential threats.\n\n[2] Data-Free Model Extraction\n\n[3] Towards Data-Free Model Stealing in a Hard Label Setting\n\n[4] MAZE: Data-Free Model Stealing Attack Using Zeroth-Order Gradient Estimation\n\n> In-depth analysis of the results is missing\u2026Does the number of training samples or the number of training iterations play an important role in security/privacy risk?\n\nWhile we appreciate the reviewer's inquiry, it appears that the question raised might have been overlooked in our paper. We would respectfully suggest revisiting Section 3.4 of our paper, where we have extensively discussed this very topic. To understand the impact of training sample quantity on the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), we conducted thorough assessments with varied sample counts, including 4 and 8 demonstrations. These specific findings, which directly address the reviewer\u2019s concern, are presented in Figure 4.\n\n> do not include the accuracy results, which is insufficient. Typically, there exists a trade-off between accuracy and security/privacy.\n\nWe acknowledge the inherent trade-off between accuracy and security/privacy, therefore in our study, as outlined in Section 3.3, our methodology involves adjusting the training dataset size to ensure comparable performance across various adaptations. This approach is in line with established practices in previous research [5]. We also agree that including the accuracy would be necessary, we have updated our paper accordingly.\n\n[5] On the Privacy Risk of In-context Learning\n\n> Compare three adaptation techniques with a na\u00efve fine-tuning approach\n\nIndeed, that would be interesting. However, the primary reason we chose to compare these three adaptation methods stems from the computational inefficiency of fine-tuning models. In practice, there's a noticeable trend toward utilizing more efficient approaches. Our study aims to investigate the privacy and security vulnerabilities associated with these efficient adaptation methods, shedding light on their potential implications in real-world scenarios."

I would suggest the authors to extend their evaluation to other modalities such as images.\n\nIn our paper, we deliberately concentrate on exploring privacy and security concerns specific to Language Model Models (LLMs). This focused approach was chosen due to the significant computational demands already present at this limited scope. Expanding our investigation further would greatly intensify these demands. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the importance of similar issues in the image domain and are planning a dedicated study to address these in the near future.\n\n> The paper only evaluates 3 parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. I would suggest conducting a more thorough study to cover more parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.\n\nFor our study, we have chosen to focus on the three most prevalent fine-tuning techniques, primarily due to the practical challenges involved in evaluating every possible method. However, we are open to suggestions from reviewers. If we missed a popular technique, we are willing to conduct additional experiments within a constrained setup to assess its efficacy and impact."
