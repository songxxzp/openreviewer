Each server is faced with a different instance of the Expert problem. In this work, the authors considered various communication models such as the message-passing model and the broadcast model, along with multiple aggregation functions, such as summing and taking the maximum of an expert\u2019s cost across servers. This article presents the first communication-efficient protocols that guarantees near-optimal regret in these settings, even against a strong adversary who can choose the inputs adaptively."

Admittedly, the expert problem has achieved great success with broadly employed in may practical application scenarios, but regarding the distributed setting, it is hard for me to map it to any specific application scenario. To make the contribution clear, please provide some examples and discussions on that in the introduction part.\nIn addition, both the communication protocols mentioned in this paper rely on a coordinator. Why is it a reasonable assumption. Does it make any difference on the results if we change the model to a fully distributed one? \n\nAlso, all the experts are forced to commit to the same expert according to the depicted problem setting. Please provide reasons for making such an assumption. \n\nThe presentation of this work is poor and should be substantially revised.\n\nThe simulation results are too simple without any support of real-world data traces and lack comparison to other related works."

Problem Definition and Practical Scenarios`\n\nWe have highlighted the motivating examples in our introduction and describe them here. For distributed online learning problems (e.g., online federated learning), you can try different sets of hyperparameters that correspond to different experts in the distributed experts problem. The goal is to adaptively choose the optimal hyperparameters on each day. A central coordinator is commonly used in such scenarios, which receives information from users along edges, and updates their model locally. If it is fully decentralized and has point-to-point communication, our communication upper bounds will still hold up to a multiplicative constant factor of 2 (and additive log(# servers)), since the coordinator can forward a message from one server to any other server. Otherwise, our communication bound depends on the specific communication topology, which is not the focus of our paper. In addition, for distributed online learning or federated learning, it is common for the coordinator to commit to the same model due to fairness and privacy issues as well as the memory overhead of storing multiple models for each downstream server.\n\n`Q2. Presentation`\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the deficiencies in our presentation. We have updated the writing accordingly in the revised version of our paper.\n\n`Q3. Evaluation`\n\nWe have evaluated our methods against real-world data trace (HPO-B) in section 6 and provided simulation evaluations in the appendix to demonstrate that our upper bound methods are robust even against extreme cost distributions (i.e., very sparsely distributed), which do not have corresponding real-world data traces."

Writing`\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the deficiencies in our presentation. In our revised version, we have unified the presentation of our communication bounds in the tables, as well as in our contributions section at the top of page 3. \n\n`Q2. Memory Bounds`\n\nFor our memory bound condition in the proof of our lower bound, we clarify that we only impose a memory bound on the downstream servers with no memory assumption on the central coordinator. We believe this assumption is both practical and provides a novel solution for bounding the communication of a server with itself across multiple days. A lower bound proof without a memory bound being imposed on downstream servers is indeed more challenging, which we leave as a very intriguing open question.\n\n`Q3. Horizon Assumption`\n\nThe $T \\in O(\\log{(ns)})$ assumption is only required for our lower bound argument in the message-passing model with maximum aggregation function. The point here is to show that the best we can do in the message-passing model with a maximum aggregation function is the naive EWA, which is the reason why we can only propose an upper bound in the blackboard model when the maximum aggregation function is used.\n\n`Q4. Evaluation`\n\nAs far as we know, our generic distributed experts setup has not been studied before. [1] only studies the setting when the cost is distributed to a single server rather than arbitrarily aggregated across multiple servers. Also, the memory-efficient streaming algorithms in [2, 3] assume a memory bound on the coordinator, which we don\u2019t have. Thus, given our generic setup, we can think of two baselines: EWA, which is known to achieve optimal regret, and EXP3, which uses less communication and can achieve near-optimal regret. Regarding HPO-B, we have cited the paper in the third paragraph of the introduction. For further clarification, we also cite this benchmark in our evaluation section as well in the revised version of our paper. We have further added more description of our experimental setup and an ablation study on the hyperparameter $b_e$ in the appendix of our revised paper. This demonstrates the communication-regret tradeoff of our methods.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

In this problem, there are a set of several servers, and there is an instance of each expert on each server. The authors consider two objectives; one objective is to minimize the sum of costs across the servers, while another objective is to minimize the maximum cost achieved across the servers. The authors also consider two message passing protocols, namely a protocol in which the central coordinator communicates directly with one server at a time, and a protocol in which the central coordinator can broadcast a message to all servers. The authors develop several algorithms with associated regret and communication costs, and also provide a lower bound communication cost for this problem. Some computational experiments are provide, applying these algorithms to a benchmark related to hyperparameter optimization."

It would help to provide more details about the HPO-B benchmark, as well as providing other instances where the distributed experts problem could apply.\n\nThe computational experiments are pretty sparse. I'm not sure why Exp3 is only compared against against the authors' algorithms with $b_e=1$ and EWA is only compared against authors' algorithms with $b_e=n$. It would also be useful to show experiments with $b_e$ taking a wider range values, to understand how this value affects the performance of the algorithm."

Assumptions post on the range and distribution of the cost`\n\nIndeed, the range of the $l_i^t$ can be within $[0, \\rho]$ for any $\\rho > 0$, and all the regret terms (both upper and lower bounds) will be multiplied by a factor of $\\rho$ accordingly. Thus, the upper-bound methods we propose are still nearly optimal. The only reason we make the assumption that $l_i^t \\in [0, 1]$ is to simplify the notation in the proof, where we can cancel out the $\\rho$ factor. We have updated this description in the revised version of our paper to clarify this confusion (note that changes in the revised version are in blue). Regarding the cost distribution, our upper bound methods are derived against strong adversaries, where the adversary can define the cost vector arbitrarily, while our lower bound proofs hold against oblivious adversaries where the adversary can choose the cost functions arbitrarily but without interacting with the algorithm."

Thus, the losses are l^t_i,j \\in [0,1]. Looking at (generally a subset of) historical data, the algorithm needs to pick an expert at each time step t, so as to minimize regret (as compared to choosing the best possible fixed expert with hindsight). The key distributed twist to the problem is that communication cost is considered alongside regret, thus obtaining obtaining historical data from servers has a cost; in this context, two cost models are considered: message-passing and broadcast. Furthermore, multiple aggregation methods are considered for total loss: in summation aggregation, the cost of an expert is the sum of the cost of an expert across servers; in maximization aggregation, the cost of an expert is the max cost of that expert across servers.\n\nThe paper gives algorithms and lower bounds, and discusses trade-offs between regret minimization and communication minimization. The upper bounds are in the strong (adaptive) adversary model, where an adversary get to observe the full history realization before choosing the costs at the next time step. Lower bounds are in the weaker, oblivious adversary model; this means the lower bounds are more powerful, since they apply even if the adversary is weak. However the lower bounds require memory bounding assumptions; this means that the lower bounds are less powerful, since they only apply when the memory restrictions exist.\n\nThe paper also provides experimental data comparing its algorithms with distributed adaptations of classical multiplicative weights."

However, in order to achieve a high probability guarantee, we propose a novel hierarchical EWA algorithm, where each i.i.d. subroutine DEWA-S or DEWA-M can be regarded as a meta-expert. Thus, by running a conventional EWA on top of these meta-experts, we obtain optimal regret with a high probability guarantee (i.e., DEWA-S-P and DEWA-M-P). We note that we also consider the maximum aggregation function in the distributed setting, and here one cannot obtain an unbiased estimator. Instead, we propose a random-walk-based communication protocol that achieves near-optimal regret with constant probability (DEWA-M) or with high probability (DEWA-M-P). To summarize, our algorithms go significantly beyond simple unbiased estimation - we (1) propose a hierarchical EWA algorithm to achieve a high probability guarantee as well as (2) a random-walk-based communication protocol when the maximum aggregation function is used.\n\n`Q2. Writing`\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing out the issues in our presentation. We have improved our writing accordingly in our revised submission."

Also, I'm glad that you have taken the comments from me and other reviewers about the writing of the paper to heart: good writing can make a world of difference in how well a reader can understand your contributions, assess them, and use them in further work. Incidentally, I recommend writing a paragraph conveying your ideas in your response to \"Q1.Major Contribution\" in the introduction of any future revision of the paper.\n\n(I tried to find your revisions, so I could comment on them; but I am unable to find them on my end of the interface.)\n\nOverall, I believe that the main idea of your paper is nice. More motivating applications would, of course, be nice (as other reviewers observed), but I feel that the theoretical question is compelling in itself. Furthermore, in your response, you noted some interesting algorithmic work (perhaps the analysis is also interesting?). However, the paper can do a substantially better job of explaining these results.\n\nI am not changing my score, since the rating is reflective not only of the quality of the results, but also of how those results are ultimately presented as a research paper; but I imagine that the results, algorithms, and analyses can be recast as a compelling research paper in the future."
