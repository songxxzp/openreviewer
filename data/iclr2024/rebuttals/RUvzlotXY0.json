Show its robustness to data biases and hyperparameter variations.\n\nPlease see **General Comments 3. Robustness to data biases**. We compared the ratio of data augmentation, as a hyperparameter, to verified the robustness of HiCBridge$^+$. While augmented data is beneficial for the generalization of HiCBridge, a high proportion of augmented data can pose challenges, contingent on data biases.\n\n\n> Weaknesses 2. A thorough comparative analysis against a wider array of both deep learning and traditional approaches. And by testing across diverse Hi-C datasets to ensure its generalizability.\n\nWe obtained enhanced Hi-C contact matices by Gaussian smoothing as a traditional method. We employed 2D Gaussian distribution with kernel size $n = 17$ and $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_y = 3$. The table below reveals that, although the traditional method demonstrates competitive results, our approach consistently outperforms all matrices. These findings underscore the superiority of our method.\n\n|Method|PCC|SPC|PSNR|SSIM|MSE|SNR|HiCRep|Insulation score|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|\n|Low resolution|0.758|0.630|13.24|0.234|0.04848|297.2|0.917|7.967|\n|Gaussian smoothing|0.948|0.875|18.31|0.348|0.01498|531.2|0.977|7.639|\n|HiCBridge$^+$|0.959|0.891|21.86|0.458|0.00678|805.6|0.984|3.365|\n\n> Weaknesses 3. Elucidating the biological significance of the resolution enhancement through detailed case studies.\n\nPlease see **General Comments, 4. Biological Significance**. We compared our model with traditional MSE and GAN methods, and found that our model preserves structural information without introducing artifacts that can be misleading.\n\n> Weaknesses 4. Computational efficiency, an essential consideration for large-scale genomic data analysis.\n\nPlease see **General Comments, 2. Computational Efficiency**. About 250 million lengths of chromosome 1 can be represented by about 430 $\\times$ 256 $\\times$ 256 Hi-C contact maps, which our model takes about 70 seconds to process.\n\n> Weaknesses 5. An in-depth consideration of the method's limitations, such as the effects of sequencing depth and data noise.\n\nIt is important to note that our model is exclusively trained on inter-chromosomal connections, so a different method is needed to handle contact maps between chromosomes. Additionally, our models are limited to resolution enhancement for a bin size of 10kb. Lastly, biased data augmentation can potentially degrade the generalization of the model, as discussed in **Weakness 1**, where the results of our model are shown to be influenced by data bias. We have added these as our limitation in **Appendix C** of the revised paper. \n\nFinally, the reviewer is kindly reminded that the data noise is mostly originated from shallow sequence depth and one of the main goals of our study is to enhancement data quality from relatively shallow sequencing depth using direct diffusion bridge. The low-resolution Hi-C data we trained corresponds to a sequence depth of about 1/16 of the high-resolution data. In this paper, our model has shown robust performance for different resolutions (1/16, 1/50 and 1/100) and different cell types; K562 (about 1/14), IMR90 (about 1/10)."

It is crucial for the authors to clearly explain the problem they aim to address and the challenges associated with it.\n\nPlease see **General Comments, 1. Difference from original methods**. We explored the best approach to leverage both the regression and generation capabilities of DDB and diffusion model. Various metrics show that our framework outperforms other models at Hi-C enhancement task. Additionally, our model has advantages not only in performance but also in the efficiency of Hi-C enhancement.\n\n> Weaknesses 2.

Biological Significance**. We highlight the limitations of models trained with traditional MSE and GAN approaches. Our model showcases conservative reconstruction, preserving structural information without introducing artifacts that could potentially lead to misinterpretation of the reconstructed Hi-C data.\n\nAn MSE-based model tends to yield blurry output as it represents the average of all plausible reconstructions. In contrast, our approach breaks down the mapping into multiple timesteps, preventing regression to the mean. While GAN-based models excel at generating photo-realistic images by training generator and discriminator, a high level of similarity in the image domain does not necessarily ensure excellent biological reconstruction. Previous methods have incorporated various additional losses to involve biological meaning, but these approaches reduce the interpretability of the model and lead inadvertent results. Our method avoids using additional losses like perception loss or insulation loss."

                    "value": "This paper addresses the resolution limitations inherent in Hi-C analysis\u2014a genomic technique that elucidates the three-dimensional architecture of chromosomes. Hi-C's utility in revealing critical genomic structures such as A/B compartments and chromatin loops is constrained by the resolution of the data, which refers to the granularity of the contact matrix generated from sequencing reads. The resolution challenge is compounded by the quadratic increase in sequencing efforts required for finer resolution, thus escalating the costs. Previous attempts to enhance the resolution of Hi-C data have leveraged deep learning approaches like HiCPlus and HiCNN; however, these methods are often limited by the computational demands and the quantity of high-resolution data needed for training.\n\nIn this context, the authors propose HiCBridge, a novel method that employs a Direct Diffusion Bridge (DDB) to learn the transformation from low to high-resolution Hi-C data. This method is designed to circumvent the shortcomings of conventional deep learning techniques that may result in overly smooth textures or mode collapse. HiCBridge integrates diffusion model-based data augmentation to handle a wider array of real-world data variations, thereby enhancing the model's applicability and robustness. The model's potential to bolster downstream genomic analyses\u2014such as 3D structure matching and loop position reconstruction\u2014positions it as a significant advancement in genomic research, offering a path to high-resolution Hi-C data without the prohibitive costs of extensive sequencing."

The robustness of the model against various datasets and its performance under different conditions (such as varying levels of input resolution) would need thorough examination.\n\nWe conducted a series of experiments to elucidate the generalization abilities of our models. We evaluated standard visual metrics, HiCRep and TAD Insulation score on different resolution (GM12878 from GSM1551551), different cell type (HMEC from GSE63525 and GSM1551610) and another species (CH12-LX from GSE63525 and GSM1551640). In the **Table 12 in Appendix E** of the revised paper, our models also reconstructed visual information and TAD boundaries on all Hi-C datasets. HMEC, with a resolution of about 1/20, poses a noisier dataset than our training data, and CH12-LX, being a mouse lymphoma cell, introduces a cross-species challenge. We supposed that these data shifts might contribute to the variation in SSIM or HiCRep performance in our models. \n\n\n|Method|PCC|SPC|PSNR|SSIM|MSE|SNR|HiCRep|Insulation score|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|:---:|:---:|\n|GM12878$_{GSM1551551}$||||||||||\n|Low resolution|0.807|0.680|14.40|0.292|0.03750|339.3|0.981|4.731|\n|HiCBridge$^+$|0.962|0.897|22.33|0.480|0.00606|846.6|0.980|2.578|\n|HMEC||||||||||\n|Low resolution|0.476|0.397|9.62|0.123|0.10968|172.3|0.850|16.253|\n|HiCBridge$^+$|0.791|0.690|13.16|0.114|0.04894|259.5|0.801|11.344|\n|CH12_LX||||||||||\n|Low resolution|0.690|0.585|13.09|0.324|0.05035|207.8|0.953|10.417|\n|HiCBridge$^+$|0.858|0.709|17.12|0.281|0.02070|336.7|0.852|6.933|\n\n> Weaknesses 2.

The paper should address the interpretability of the HiCBridge model. Understanding how the model makes its predictions is crucial, particularly in genomic studies where the biological implications of the findings are as important as the findings themselves.\n\nTo understand how the model handles a given input, we analyzed the attention map of the self-attention module in the first layer of HiCBridge$^+$. As depicted in **Fig.7 in Appendix D** of the revised paper, we observed that each head emphasized a distinct region: head 0 allocates more attention to diagonal bins, head 1 highlights regions slightly off the diagonals, head 2 is dedicated to a 0.5Mb range of bins, and head 3 focuses on bins in more distant regions. Accordingly, our network can understand semantic structure of the contact map, a desired property for Hi-C data processing."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and the thorough feedback. For point-to-point response, see below.\n\n> Weaknesses 1. The contribution of this paper is limited. The proposed HiCBridge directly borrows idea from the Direct Diffusion Bridge without any improvement. While the proposed diffusion-based data augmentation (Algorithm 1 and 2) is also trivial. It seems like the paper tends to apply the existing method to the new task, but lack of novelty.\n\nPlease see **General Comments, 1. Difference from original methods** along with the revised paper. We highlight that we found the optimal combination of DDB and diffusion for Hi-C enhancement task, which cannot be regarded as trivial given the importance of the Hi-C data processing.\n\n> Weaknesses 2. It is not clear how the Algorithm 1 can be used to generate the low-resolution data as your target distribution is based on x0 (high-resolution Hi-C data). Please check whether the x0 in Algorithm 1 should be x1.\n\nThanks for pointing out the typo. We have fixed our Algorithm 1 accordingly. \n\n> Weaknesses 3. It seems like the diffusion augmentation is unusable in higher resolution cases for inferior performance, according to the Table 4.\n\nIf our interpretation of the reviewer's comment is accurate, the aim is to clarify the subpar performance of HiCBridge$^+$ at extremely low resolutions (1/50 and 1/100). As highlighted in the **General Comments, 3. Robustness to data biases**, our analysis suggests that biased data augmentation holds the potential to compromise the model's generalization. While the incorporation of generated low-resolution data contributes to the overall generalization of HiCBridge, an excessive bias with such data may lead to a deterioration in HiCBridge$^+$'s performance across diverse Hi-C datasets. It is crucial to note that the data compared in Table 4 of our paper consists of downsampled data rather than real low-resolution data, presenting a distribution distinct from the one the model was trained on [1]. This finding offers a plausible explanation for the observed reduction in the generalizability of HiCBridge$^+$ compared to HiCBridge, especially at extremely low-resolution settings.\n\n[1] A comprehensive evaluation of generalizability of deep-learning based Hi-C resolution improvement methods, Murtaza et al., Biorxiv, 2022"

We have distinguished our work from previous papers by finding a proper combination of diffusion model and direct diffusion bridge for Hi-C enhancement to establish an effective and efficient framework.\n\n2. We have corrected Algorithm 1, which was incorrectly stated.\n\n3. We have explained that HiCBridge$^+$ underperforms at extremely low resolutions. An experiment in **Table 11 in Appendix B** showed that diffusion augmentation can suffer performance degradation due to shifts in the data distribution.\n\nWe would like to gently remind you that the end of the discussion period is imminent. We would appreciate it if you could let us know whether our comments addressed your concerns.\n\nBest regards, Authors"
