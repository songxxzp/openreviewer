The paper defines natural language predicates which are learned from a simple linear model combined with prompting an LLM to describe the individual components of the linear model by observing the scores each component gives to each example. The predicates produced can be steered by the user providing a meta-constraint, a predicate on that should be satisfied by all of the predicates. Various ablations are evaluated empirically against one another using a LLM evaluation scheme contrastive feature learning and clustering datasets."

Am I also correct in my understanding that this necessitates combing through entire dataset and prompting the language model whether each of the sentences therein satisfies the natural language predicate, and repeating that for every predicate $\\phi_i$. That seems to already be very computationally expensive.\n\n- I am not sure I understand the subsection \"Modeling Uninformative Nuisances with a Base Distribution\". How is the base distribution $B$ typically defined? Is it some pretrained model? Could you please expand on what you mean by \"the background distribution is this important, but only for the purposes of selecting good $w$ and $\\phi$\" as well as your use of a \"semiparameteric approach\"\n\n- In Section 4, how do you get the continuous unit vector $\\tilde{\\phi}\\_k$ ? Is it simply the standard unit vector?\n\n- I would've expected to see some form of gradient estimator here to back-propagate through the non-differentiable discretization.
