It adopts concepts from category theory, specifically colimits, to describe the structure and relationships of infinite sequences of metabeliefs. The primary objective is to offer a systematic and unified view of metabeliefs. The paper achieves this through a series of lemmas, definitions, and examples, particularly using the rock-paper-scissors game as a recurring motif."

If the reviewer has specific suggestions, those would be appreciated.  \n(3) Yes, we do plan to write subsequent papers on specific applications! As suggested in the introduction, we believe there are quite significant implications across learning, reinforcement learning, and social inference. In each case, engaging with the literate will require additional notion and technical machinery, and we therefore believe it best to tackle these applications in subsequent papers. If the reviewer raises their rating a bit, that would help us move faster toward that goal!\n\nThanks again!"

I have a hard time connecting the theme of this paper to the scope of ICLR and my second question specifically mentioned \"in machine learning\". \nAfter reading your response to other reviewers, I also was wondering how exactly \"Beliefs are different from strategy\" (in your response to Reviewer y6tA). In one sense, beliefs are our brain's strategy to maintain a world representation that has minimum inconsistencies and fits that of the social group around us."

To respond to the reviewer's question, we are not aware of any comparable methods of modeling metabeliefs to which we may compare. If the reviewer has specific examples in mind, those would be appreciated. \n\nWe agree that understanding how the colimit might be useful in machine learning is important. We believe that applications are beyond the scope of the current paper, given the already significant technical content. To improve the clarity of the connection, we have elaborated the example in Section 4: Computing distance in the colimit: rock-paper-scissors. In particular, we give the solution to the $3\\times 3$ optimization problem, and simplify the integration to remove the infima. We hope this helps make potential connections more clear."

It seems we agree that beliefs of finite depth are important.\" No, I'm claiming the opposite. Belief about belief about beliefs to finite depths are not useful and are misleading. The infinite limit (equilibrium) is useful, but as in the link I provided above, stopping at any finite depth often gives beliefs that are a function of the depth, not of anything else.  Beliefs about actions are imperative for intelligent action and AI, but that is not the same.\n\n(I am not objecting to you claiming they are useful, I am objecting to you asserting they are useful without any evidence.  I'm also not clear why a category theory formalization is useful. Also, it isn't really relevant to ICLR.)\n\nIn another answer you said there wasn't a recent literature. Monte Carlo tree search (as, e.g., used in AlphaZero) can be seen as stochastic simulation through the space of belief about beliefs (where the beliefs are about the *actions* of the other agent); one reason it works is that it does not stop at an arbitrary point, but goes to the end of the episode/game. Also, (depending on what you mean by recent) Joe Halpern of Cornell has written many papers on this topic. A quick look found https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/abstract.html#journal67"

                        "value": "We wish to thank the reviewer for their question. To respond directly: The reviewer is incorrect, Nash equilibria are different from colimit spaces induced by metabeliefs. Specifically, the question at the end of paragraph 4 is ``Can we consider beliefs at all levels simultaneously?''. Beliefs are different from strategy. Nash equilibria assume away the problem of beliefs and this is one reason that such equilibria are not effective models of behavior. Our contribution is to offer a precise mathematical formalization of reasoning about metabeliefs of all levels. \n\nMore technically: \n- The reviewer mentions that ``the limit $P^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{X})$ is the fixed point which is the definition of a Nash equilibrum....\" The space $P^{\\infty}(\\mathcal{X})$ here is a topological space consisting of every distribution in $\\mathcal{P}^n(\\mathcal{X})$ for every finite $n$, as well as points of $\\mathcal{X}$, modulo identifying the embedding of each $\\mathcal{P}^n(\\mathcal{X})$ into $\\mathcal{P}^{n+1}(\\mathcal{X})$. To say that this space is a Nash equilbrium does not make sense: the space is a collection of equivalence classes with a topology imposed on them, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies for each player in a non-cooperative game such that each player has no preference for switching strategies.\n- The setting of Nash equilibria applies to non-cooperative games in which each player knows the equilibria strategies of the other players. Our setting is applicable to non-cooperative games, cooperative games, and things that are not games, and is focused in the rock-paper-scissors example on Bob not knowing Alice's strategy, her equilibrium strategy, or even exactly what her space of strategies might be.\n- In order to fix the confusion surrounding the rock-paper-scissors example, we have changed \"In order for Bob to generate his own strategy, he must consider what he knows....\" from the example on page 4 to the following: \"In order for Bob to generate his own strategy, he may consider what he knows....\"\n\nWe apologize for any confusion created by our wording, and thank the reviewer for their comments."

                        "value": "The point of that Nash equilibrium is that we don't need or want to do the infinite regress of meta-beliefs. It is not as though the people who have studied this over the decades did not explore the tree of meta-beliefs; it's just that it is too difficult and not needed,  \"every distribution... for every finite n\" is the wrong thing to do. Every finite set of beliefs about beliefs can give the wrong answer!! (Rock-paper-scissors is too symmetric to explain the problem; I found a good example at https://artint.info/3e/html/ArtInt3e.Ch14.S4.html). In such examples, every finite sequence of meta beliefs gives an arbitrary answer. It's the fixed point / equilibrium, not the space of all finite parts, that forms the rational belief. An agent doesn't need to do the reasoning about meta-beliefs to arbitrary depths, which you just assume is a useful thing to do. \"Nash equilibria assume away the problem of beliefs\" - precisely because the infinite regress is the wrong thing to do (and finite subparts are even more useless). In the paper \"In practice, metabeliefs are typically truncated to a finite sequence.\" isn't true; it is typical that the equilibrium is used (discounting means  finite part is a good approximation to the equilibrium).\n\nIn a Nash equilibria an agent doesn't need to know the strategies of the other players (perhaps selecting which Nash equilibrium, but is there is only one then there is no reason to deviate). There are related equilibria (such as correlated equilibria) for other games (where \"game\" is a very general concept of multi-agent interaction).  There is a reason they rejected the explicit (infinite) regress of meta-beliefs.\n\nThe motivation of the paper seemed to be mis-guided. Perhaps there is a venue for this paper, but ICLR isn't it. (Perhaps KR or AAMAS)."

I admit that I am sceptical about many of the justifications for higher order beliefs, but the limiting approach that the authors take seem well founded, and alleviates some of my initial reservations. I like that the authors do not assume that there is a boundary of the level of uncertainty of uncertainty\n\nIn section 4, the example that shows the most promise in my opinion, is the one about hierarchical models.

However, I found myself sometimes lost in Section 2, which contains abstract material. I believe that, given the page limitations, it is difficult to improve this, but perhaps some clarifications are possible.\n\nI believe that there on two technical parts, there are details missing.

                    "value": "I start with my two main questions:\n\n1/ page 3, Lemma 2: I think that the authors need to be careful with the range of n. More specifically, what happens if n=0? Does the metric space {\\cal X} contain distributions?\n- If not, can we always assume that n\u22651? Why?\n- If so, that is a structural assumption on {\\cal X} that seems strange, and needs to be spelled out.\nIt could be that I misunderstand something here. What could improve my understanding, is having the answer to the following question: What is the form of the equivalence class that contains an element of {\\cal X}?\n\n2/ page 5, Lemma 6: The authors don't prove that the alleged metric is positive definite (that W(mu,nu)>0 if mu\u2260nu). I believe that this is a requirement of the usual definition of a metric. Do the authors need this? If so, does their map W satisfy this?\n\nI conclude my review with a list of some small remarks and typos:\n\npage 1, first paragraph following the abstract: \"... to sequences of beliefs quantify uncertainty ...\" should read something like \"... to sequences of beliefs that quantify uncertainty ...\" (so sets with a \"that\", or an alternative).\n\npage 1, second paragraph: There is a dot missing after the third sentence.\n\npage 1, fourth paragraph: \"... one must play of the three options.\" should read \"... one must play one of the three options.\".\n\npage 1, fifth paragraph: \"geoemtric\" should read \"geometric\". In the following sentence, the word \"gives\" is superfluous.\n\npage 2, paragraph following Theorem 1: \"Parts (2)--(6)\" should be \"Parts (2)--(5)\", I believe, since there are only 5 parts in Theorem 1.\n\npage 3, Lemma 3: In the proof, the authors use a result that guarantees that each {\\cal P}^m({\\cal X}) is T1 if {\\cal X} is T1. While I can believe this is true, I would like to have a proof. Is this a standard \nresult? If so, it might be worth giving a reference.\n\npage 3, Lemma 5: Its proof appears in the supplementary material as well as in the paper; perhaps the copy in the paper can be omitted?\n\npage 4, proof of Theorem 4: Theorem 1 part (4) talks about *compact* spaces, and not about the weaker notion of *paracompact* spaces. Why can this be inferred? If that's not immediate, perhaps it suffices for the \nfurther applications that the spaces are compact, in addition to being paracompact?\n\npage 5, Lemma 6: There is a dot missing at the end of the lemma.\n\npage 5, right hand side of Equation (10): the part of the expression after | is not a condition, which reads a bit strangely. I suggest that the authors add that \\tilde\\nu \\in the sets shown, if that's correct.\n\npage 5, Equation (11): Why is does \\Delta^i commute with \\bigcap and \\bigcup? This must be some standard result, but I don't seem to find a reference for this.\n\npage 6, Lemma 11: The authors should define the map ev already here, as they use it in their commuting diagram. Now they only define the map ev later on in Section 2.\n\npage 8, subsection \"Competitive/Cooperative games\": There is a dot lacking between the first two sentences. Also, \"In this sense, both agents beliefs ...\" should read \"In this sense, both agents' beliefs ...\"."

                        "value": "We wish to thank the reviewer for their enthusiastic support and helpful and detailed feedback. We have addressed the reviewer's two main questions as follows:\n\n- On page 3 in Lemma 2, we have added the following clarification for $n=0$: In place of \"...$\\mu$ is a unique distribution in $\\mathcal{P}^n(\\mathcal{X})$ such that $\\mu$ is not a single-atom Dirac distribution.\" We replace with: \"...$\\mu$ is a unique distribution in $\\mathcal{P}^n(\\mathcal{X})$ such that $\\mu$ is not a single-atom Dirac distribution or $\\mu$ is a unique point in $\\mathcal{X}$ (recall that $\\delta^0(x)=\\delta_x$ is the Dirac distribution in $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathcal{X})$ with support equal to $\\{x\\}$).\"\n- $W_p^{\\infty}$ is indeed positive definite. We have added this proof to the proof of Lemma 6 given in the appendix: ``Let $\\mu\\in\\mathcal{P}_p^m(\\mathcal{X})$ and $\\nu\\in\\mathcal{P}_p^n(\\mathcal{X})$ with $m\\geq n$ such that $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ are not single-atom Dirac distributions (so they could be either different distributions or points in $\\mathcal{X}$). By definition, $W_p^{\\infty}([\\mu],[\\nu])=W_p^m(\\mu,\\nu_m)$, where $\\nu_m$ is the unique element in the intersection $[\\nu]\\cap\\mathcal{P}_p^m$. Then because $W_p^m$ is a metric, $W_p^m(\\mu,\\nu_m)\\geq 0$ with $W_p^m(\\mu,\\nu_m)=0$ if and only if $\\mu=\\nu_m$. However, if $\\mu=\\nu_m$, then because we have chosen $m$ so that $\\mu$ is not a single-atom Dirac distribution, $\\nu_m$ is not a single-atom Dirac distribution. Therefore since $\\nu_m\\in [\\nu]$ and $[\\nu]$ is the unique non-single-atom Dirac distribution (or point in $\\mathcal{X}$) in $[\\nu]$, we have $\\mu=\\nu_m=\\nu$.\"\n\nWe also fix all of the typos in the list provided, and wish to once again thank the reviewer for providing such a detailed list.\nHere are some more detailed responses to a few of the small remarks:\n\n- The T1 claim may be found in Parthasarathy (2005) \"Introduction to Probability and Measure\", though the statement can also be amended to change T1 to, say, locally compact and metrizable, and the statement is easy to prove directly.\n- Many of the applications (particularly to machine learning) implicitly use compact spaces; however in the statement of part 4 of Theorem 1, \"compact\" can be changed to \"paracompact,\" and the statement is still true (albeit weaker). We have amended this.\n- We have fixed the right-hand side of Equation 10 by removing the unnecessary and confusing portions of the notation: the beginning and ending curly braces and the $\\nu\\in\\mathcal{P}_p^i(\\mathcal{X})$.\n- $\\Delta^i$ commutes with $\\bigcup$ since for any function $f$ and sets $A,B$, $f(A\\cup B)=f(A)\\cup f(B)$. To make the passage from equation 11 to equation 12 more clear, we have added a few lines to the proof (including why $\\Delta^i$ commutes with $\\bigcap$). This addition begins immediately following Equation 11, \"Applying $\\Delta^i$...\" and continues until just before Equation 14, terminating with, \"Now, Equation 13 becomes:\"."
