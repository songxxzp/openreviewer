The attack is evaluated on the synthetic dataset generated with diffusion models. Few other useful techniques such as model uncertainty and noise augmentation were incorporated to make the attack better."

Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed attack method can generate both no-box and black-box adversarial examples effectively and outperform the existing methods with higher attack success rate."

In the experimental setup of the paper, the authors use the Stable-diffusion model to generate data for training the substitute models, and conduct no-box/black-box experiments using the ImageNet dataset. Is there any evidence to prove that there is no data from the ImageNet dataset in the training set of the stable-diffusion model used in this paper? If not, can it be claimed that such an experimental setup \"does not use any training data from the target model\"?\n\n3. It is not surprising that the diffusion model can be used to generate adversarial examples. More importantly, it seems that the authors did not really test whether those adversarial examples can be easily defended (e.g., diffusion purification [2])\n\n4. The overall organization of the paper and the use of symbols are somewhat chaotic, and the explanation of the formulas is insufficient. For example, the authors did not explain the meanings of most of the symbols in Eq. (3). Vectors are not represented using \\mathbf{} as suggested, and the formatting of the subscripts in the symbols is also inconsistent.\n\n\n[1] Shao, M., Meng, L., Qiao, Y., Zhang, L., & Zuo, W.
