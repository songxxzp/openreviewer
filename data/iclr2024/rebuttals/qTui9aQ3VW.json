What I mean is that it is not enough to just state the words of \"white-box, black-box\" and so on, but one needs to have a discussion about what exactly these mean in the EBM case.\n\nFor example, it is somewhat clear from the early in the paper that the free phase of the inference may have gradient-masking behavior, but this was never discussed early on (and it is not enough to just say \"we did white-box attacks\", which in fact is actually already different from previous definitions of \"white-box attacks\"), and only until quite later in the experiments, we have an actual paragraph of \"gradient obfuscation\".\n\nIn other words, one should lead with a discussion specifically about how we attacked EBM, and be very clear about the inference stage issues. That will make the paper stronger.\n\nAside from that, while I do like the topic in this paper, the technical content seems to be a somewhat straightforward evaluation of EBM. They are good to know definitely, but the contributions are somewhat still limited."

Below we include our detailed response.\n# Response to concerns\n1. The use of the terms \u2018white-box\u2019 and \u2018black-box\u2019 attacks in the introduction of the paper has been clarified to reflect their significance.\n2. While we agree that just saying \u2018we conducted white-box attacks\u2019 is not enough, we would like to strongly emphasize the fact that we are indeed conducting direct gradient-based attacks, where the adversary has access to the model\u2019s exact gradients across time. This is in contrast to the inexact and indirect gradient-based attacks carried out on Deep Equilibrium Models, which has been discussed in detail in section 2.2. More specifically, we evaluate the gradient of the loss term with respect to the input to compute the perturbation to the images. We thank the reviewer once again for pointing this issue in our writing and we modified section 3.1 and section 3.3 to include details of our attacks, which we hope would improve the readability of the paper.\n3. There have been several works in the ICLR community that highlight the growing concern of computational complexity of adversarial training, particularly as model size continues to grow. As pointed out in [R1,R2], adversarial training is not just computationally expensive, it often does not generalize to attacks that are different from the ones that the models were trained on. Hence the search for simpler approaches, that are able to generalize their robustness to multiple forms of attacks, is gaining importance. Thus we anticipate that generalized robust models of the future would often be known for their simple implementations, and we hope our work serves as a stepping stone for such models.\n\n\n[R1] Wong, Eric, Leslie Rice, and J.

This detail is needed to understand how to perform gradient-based adversarial attacks on EBM.\n    - How costly are EBMs compared to the traditional models? This information is needed to justify the simple model architecture used in experiments.\n3. The model architecture (four convolutional layers followed by a fully connected layer) is too simple.

Probably, it would be better to use a dataset that such semantic changes are more visible. For example, I\u2019m curious about the changes from attacking EP-CNN trained on MNIST or a dataset containing face images.\n3. Minor comments\n    - To add an appendix, you should use `\\appendix` command in LaTeX.\n    - Consider making EP-CNN results more visible in the plot. For example, make other lines thinner in the plot, so that you can emphasize EP-CNN results. Also, it is better to render EP-CNN results after rendering other lines so that the other lines are now drawn over the EP-CNN results."

                        "value": "We thank Reviewer GSeC for their detailed feedback and their critical assessment of the paper. Here we address reviewer GSeC\u2019s concerns in detail.\n\n# Response to concerns\n\n1. We agree with the reviewer that it is unclear what loss function is used to train and attack the EP model, and that this information is important for accurately assessing the robustness of EP to adversarial attacks. Cross-entropy loss is used to train and attack all models tested here, including EP. As a result, we believe the experiments are sound because we are training and attacking EP the same way as all other models, which is the standard way to train and attack deep neural network classifiers in general. We will add these details in the main text to ensure that this is clear.\n2. We admit that details on carrying out white-box attacks are not straightforward and are grateful to reviewer GSeC for pointing this out. As a result, we are moving the section on temporal projected gradient descent from the appendix to the methods section 3.2.\n3. Describing EBM in detail\n    - We are including clarifying sections in the methods section which explains how predictions are made by models trained with Equilibrium Propagation.\n    - The training cost of such models are discussed in section 4.2. As of the time of writing this paper, EP has only been able to scale to ImageNet32 [R1] and takes exponentially more time and computational resources to attack, when implemented on standard GPU based hardware. Our implementations offer a speedup of 30% as discussed in section 4.2, which was one of the major reasons we were able to carry out gradient-based attacks in a reasonable amount of time.\n4. The implemented model architecture is kept simple because it is expensive to train on standard hardware. As the world starts moving towards non-standard spiking hardware, such models will become the more efficient alternative. We are confident that these would scale to more complex architectures / problems as previous work by Laborieux et al. [R1] have shown that even such small models perform well across various complex tasks (CIFAR 10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-32).\n\n# Answers to Questions by Reviewer GSeC\n1. Severity of natural noise is described in the paper that introduced the CIFAR10-C dataset [R2], which is a standard benchmark used to evaluate robustness to natural noise.\n2. We admit to the fact that attacked images in Figure 5 may not always appear as \u201cdeer\u201d to our readers. To this end, we are including a collage of images from multiple classes bearing perturbations in the appendix, to convince our readers that perturbations in EP are not limited to the background.\n3. Minor comments\n    - We apologize for the use of sections instead of using /appendix in the paper. We thank reviewer GSeC for pointing out this error. We have fixed this issue in our paper.\n    - We are grateful to reviewer GSeC for pointing out the fact that the plots of EP should be rendered above the lines corresponding to robust accuracies of other models.\n\n\n[R1] Laborieux, Axel, and Friedemann Zenke. \"Holomorphic equilibrium propagation computes exact gradients through finite size oscillations.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 12950-12963.\n\n[R2] Hendrycks, Dan, and Thomas Dietterich. \"Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2018."

Here we address reviewer 8aDx\u2019s concerns in detail.\n# Response to concerns\n1. We added a table summarizing the results of all adversarial attacks against all models tested. Results for EP are presented separately, at the end of the table, for each of the attacks. The best performing robust accuracies for each epsilon has been highlighted and comparison with EP shows that EP performs as good as the adversarially trained models for moderate attacks.\n\n2. We would like to address the concerns about novelty in terms of our approach.Energy-based models are a class of AI models that learn through local learning rules and the limited previous work that exists, has only focused on different training techniques and architectures but has not addressed the robustness of these models. We were the first to show the inherent robustness of models trained with Equilibrium Propagation, through an ensemble of attacks where the gradient-based attacks were carried out exactly. As a result, we believe the novelty and contribution of the results is more than marginal.\n\n3. We have added detailed procedure on attacking the EBM model and renamed section 3.1 to clearly reflect our contributions\n\n4. We add an additional section into the appendix of the paper where we provide an intuitive discussion of where the robustness comes from (energy landscape of the EBM). We leave thorough theoretical analysis for future work.\n\n5. We do not anticipate our results would change very much under different data modalities. However, this is outside of the scope of this work, which was to test the robustness of existing EP models (which have been applied only to image classification in previous works). We do agree that this is a good suggestion for future work, though.\n\n\nWe thank you again for your valuable feedback.  Please let us know if the above explanations do not address your concerns completely. We are happy to answer any further questions."

Though the paper mentions that the high time cost limits EP models to relatively shallow architectures, I think the experiments that mainly focus on PGD are not enough. There are other attack methods, e.g., FGSM [1], C&W [2], AA [3], etc. The conclusion that EBMs trained with EP have better robustness will be more convincing if more attack methods are evaluated, even though the models have relatively simple architecture and the datasets are relatively small.\n2. The superiority of the EP models in robustness is mainly shown by experimental results, which lack theoretical analysis and support. If rigorous mathematical analysis is too hard, then at least an intuitive analysis based on formulas that show why EP models can function well should be provided.\n\n---\n[1] Goodfellow, I.

For the second term on the right side of Equation 1, I think it is possible that there are pooling layers following the FC layers. In other words, the second term can still contain $\\mathcal{P}(\\cdot)$?\n2. According to my understanding, in Section 3.1, the training goal is to update the convolution weights $w_{n}$? However, I am unclear how the weights $w_n$ are updated based on Equations 4-6 related to the states $s^{n-1}$ and $s^{n+1}$. Can there be more explanation?\n3. As mentioned in the limitation, ``EP is relatively sensitive to the hyperparameters used to train the model as well as the seed used to initialize the weights``. Are there some heuristic rules to set the hyperparameters and the weights' initialization?\n4. Some editorial issues (just listed a few):\n- Better not to use contractions such as ``didn't``, ``don't``, ``weren't``.\n- It is a bit strange that there are the right brackets after BP-CNN and AdvCNN, respectively, but not the right bracket after ViT in Section 4.1.1.\n- A missing period ``.`` after the second paragraph in Section 4.1.1.\n- Inconsistent representations when referring to figures. For example, ``Fig. 2 and Fig. 10`` and ``Figure 1`` on page 8.\n- On page 6, ``Figure 3,4`` should be ``Figures 3,4``.\n- ..."

We are encouraged that Reviewer QZD5 finds our approach pioneering and capable of leading to multiple follow-up works, this is indeed the kind of reception we hoped for. Below we address Reviewer QZD5's concerns in detail and provide additional experimental results.\n # Responses to concerns\n1. We have indeed conducted the AA attack and presented our results in Figure 4 in the original submission. We also conducted C&W attacks across all models and have added the results in the appendix. However, we would like to discuss a few details on FGSM and C&W.\n   - FGSM is a 1-step version of PGD and thus superseded by both PGD and AA, which we use in other experiments and have presented in the results section of the original submission. Many other previous works have also illustrated that PGD attacks provide a much better test of a model\u2019s robustness relative to FGSM. For all of these reasons, we believe it is unnecessary to include FGSM attacks in our experiments.\n    - We agree with the reviewer that the inclusion of C&W attacks would provide a more thorough evaluation of EP\u2019s robustness, and we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have included results from a C&W attack in the modified submission. Under these C&W attacks, EP is one of the most robust models, even more than the adversarially trained models, for the CIFAR-100 dataset.\n2. We appreciate your comment about our work lacking theoretical analysis. We added a section in the appendix that provides intuitive analysis and hypothesis of why EBM models are more resistant to adversarial attacks as opposed to traditional training methods and we leave a thorough theoretical approach for future work.\n# Answers to questions by Reviewer QZD5\n1. There are no pooling layers following the fully connected layers, so the second term on the right side does not contain any pooling terms.\n2. Weight update rules are provided in the supplementary section of the original paper[R1].\n3. For a hyperparameter search, one has to check the state of the system after activations have been applied and make sure the value of the states post-activation are not zeroed.\n4. We are very grateful to you for pointing out the editorial issues and we have made sure that the paper is grammatically consistent and easier to read.\n\n\nThank you again for your time and effort in reviewing our paper! We believe your suggestions have strengthened our paper greatly. Please let us know if the above explanations do not address your concerns completely. We are happy to answer any further questions.\n\n\n[R1] Laborieux, Axel, et al. \"Scaling equilibrium propagation to deep convnets by drastically reducing its gradient estimator bias.\" Frontiers in neuroscience 15 (2021): 633674."
