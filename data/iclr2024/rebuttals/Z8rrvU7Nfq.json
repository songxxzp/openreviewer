Overall, the theoretical results presented in this paper are very clear. However, my primary concern lies in the technical contributions of the paper, as it appears the authors did not mention where the main technical challenges lie compared to the training of ordinary feedforward neural networks. I believe the paper should also emphasize what the core technical innovations are. In conclusion, I think there is room for improvement in this paper, at least in terms of writing and experimental validation."

For instance, compared to ordinary Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs), what are the significant challenges in error estimation for neural operators, and what new techniques are necessary to derive their convergence bound? Moreover, the better performance of wider and deeper neural networks in fitting data is already a well-acknowledged fact in the field, so deriving this conclusion cannot be considered a major contribution of this paper.\n2. The paper derives the convergence rate for two neural operators (FNO and DeepONet) but does not provide a comparison between them, nor does it elaborate on their differences and connections. Additionally, there is no discussion on whether the derivation method proposed in this paper can be applied to or how it might be improved for neural operators beyond the aforementioned two structures.\n3. The experimental section could benefit from additional validation. For instance, for the 2-dimensional Darcy flow problem and the 2D time-dependent Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, which are commonly used datasets, it is imperative that the authors also conduct experimental validation on them. Furthermore, since the data used for neural operators adhere to PDEs, verifying which datasets satisfy the assumptions made in the paper would also be valuable.\n4. \")\" is missing in the title of section 3.2."

This does not seem to at all be consistent with how DeepONets work - where usually at each $k$ its a different set of parameters - albeit with an overlap. So the very premise of the paper seems suspect! \n\nAlso in Section 3.1, the bold facing of $f, g, u$ and $x$ seem to be inconsistent.\nFor eg. $f_k$ is not bold in the first paragraph, but it is bold in the second. \nThis creates sufficient confusion with regards to following the paper. \n\nIn Section 4, Theorem 1 is almost identical to Theorem 5.3 in the Banerjee.et.al (2023). \nIt is not made clear in the writing if this theorem is exactly the same or if it is different, then how exactly does it differ from the other.  \n\nIn Section 5, Definition 2, $f_{k}^{(i)}$ and $g_{k,j}^{(i)}$ are not defined anywhere.  \n\nThe $t-$dependence of the potential contraction factor, $\\frac{\\alpha_t \\omega_t (1-\\gamma_t)}{\\beta} (2 - \\omega_t)$, in equation $9$ raises questions about why this should result in geometric convergence.

                    "value": "- The paper states that a takeaway of the theoretical results is that 'wider networks lead to better optimization convergence'. For both the FNO and DON the RSC property (one of the two sufficient conditions for convergence) holds whenever the predicted gradient is bounded ($\\| \\nabla_{\\theta} \\bar{G}_t \\|^2 = \\Theta (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}})$) and RSC holds then in probability of at least $1 - \\frac{4 L}{m}$. So it appears that wide networks are not only beneficial for convergence, but are actually required for the results to hold? I'd suggest to make this more explicit in the beginnig / abstract.\n- As stated in the paper, the results are inspired by the work of Banerjee et al. (2023). There, a similar analysis is performed for feed forward networks, and for that setting the conditions for RSC is similarly $\\| \\nabla_{\\theta} \\bar{G}_t \\|^2 = \\Theta (\\frac{poly(L)}{\\sqrt{m}})$. Does that also yield the interpretation of 'wider networks are better', and if so, to what extent do the the results differ for the two settings (feedforward networks, neural operators)? Did the authors perform experiments with respect to the depth of the networks?\n- In Condition 2 (smoothness) it might help the reader to mention that it will be shown in probability. Also, what is the set $\\mathcal{N}(\\Theta)$?\n- The plots (Figure 1, 2) would benefit from concise (and consistent) titles and labels. What is the meaning of epochs%100?"
