It uses Laplacian residual connections to adapt the resolution of models quickly, reducing computation as resolution decreases. ARRNs also incorporate Laplacian dropout to enhance the networks' robustness to low-resolution signals. This allows for training high-resolution ARRNs that can later be compressed into effective low-resolution ARRNs."

                        "value": "We appreciate your engagement with our work. We have provided a revised manuscript that includes more thourough experiments, that is more concise, and that better situates and differentiates our method relative to prior methods. \n\n**Q1.1)** The application scenario of the algorithm is not clear. The proposed algorithm can only deal with the resolutions corresponding to those of Laplacian residuals.\n\n**A1.1)** As you have noted, rediscretization applies in resolution steps that correspond to the resolutions of Laplacian residuals. While not ideal, we believe this is in fact an excellent compromise. Given an input whose resolution falls just between the resolution of two Laplacian residuals, the input can simply be rediscretized to the resolution of either residual block in a preprocessing step, which still results in excellent performance and improved computational efficiency, as shown in our experiments. This compromise is what allows us to make the resolution of layers nested within Laplacian residual blocks fixed while making the resolution of the whole network adaptive. This allows us to use standard layers, unlike previous methods that feature adaptive input resolution. This is a central aspect of the novelty of the method, and it makes it much easier to integrate with existing work on convolutional neural networks.\n\n**Q3)** The paper does not compare with networks have adaptive input resolution. \n\n**A3)** We do not see this as a detraction to the novelty of our method. ARRN is a drop-in technique that provides adaptive input resolution for residual networks built with standard layers. It makes most sense to compare ARRN with typical convolutional neural networks that are constructed with similar standard layers, as it reveals that our drop-in technique causes no loss in performance. This comparison cannot be made against existing methods with adaptive input resolution methods because they are not drop-in techniques. This is because they impose difficult design constraints on the layers they contain, which is explained in detail in the updated related works section. In contrast, our method is free from these limitations.\n\n**Q2)** The method performs poorly without Laplacian dropout. It is not clear whether Laplacian dropout is responsible for improved robustness at low resolution.\n\n**A2)** The effectiveness of Laplacian dropout is supported by our experiments.  With Laplacian dropout, rediscretized ARRNs show overwhelming improvement in robustness at low resolution without compromise in performance at high resolution, even compared to well-established convolutional neural networks that specialise at a single high resolution. Without Laplacian dropout, rediscretized ARRNs show very poor robustness at low resolution. This poor performance is not an indication that the method is flawed, but an indication that Laplacian dropout is responsible for the improvement in robustness. This poor performance is without practical consequence because Laplacian dropout will be employed in every use case that aligns with the core motivation of the method, which is to allow adapting high resolution ARRNs to low resolution ARRNs for improved computational efficiency without re-training.\n\n**Q4)** How are the filter kernels set?\n\n**A4)** We have updated the implementation paragraph of subsection 4.1 to provide detailed parameters for the kernels. \n\n**Q1.2)** The experiments only cover small resolution datasets.\n\n**A1.2)** We have updated our experiments to cover the higher resolution TinyImageNet dataset, and also include a larger set of baseline methods spanning all usual variants of ResNet, WideResNetV2, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetV2. Our method ARRN remains more robust at lower resolution than these standard methods while also beating their performance at the highest resolution. We would like to include the ImageNet dataset in our experiments however given limited time and computational resources we are not able to cover it appropriately. We believe our contribution is solid nonetheless as the novel properties of ARRNs are well supported by theory.\n\nWe hope that this comment, the improved manuscript, and the updated set of experiments address your concerns."

                        "value": "We appreciate your engagement with our work. We have provided a revised manuscript that includes more thourough experiments, that is more concise, and that better situates and differentiates our method relative to prior methods.\n\n**Q2)** The novelty is limited. As said in the related works section, this work is merely an extension of Lai 2017 & Singh 2021.\n\n**A2)** We maintain that Singh 2021 is unrelated to adaptive resolution approaches, and that ARRN is fundamentally distinct from Lai 2017. [Edited to discuss references separately] This prior method uses residuals chained by *increasing* resolution, and can adapt its *output* resolution by omitting residuals at the *tail* of the chain, which is well suited for super-resolution tasks. In contrast, ARRN uses residuals chained by *decreasing* resolution, and can adapt its *input* resolution by removing residuals at the *head* of the chain, which is more appropriate for classification tasks. Removing residuals at the *head* of the chain is nontrivially different from removing residuals at the *tail* of the chain, as later residuals must not be disturbed by the removal. We construct ARRNs around a novel theoretical analysis of this constraint. \n\nWe also highlight that prior methods which allow adaptive *input* resolution are either based on *neural operators* or *implicit neural representations*, which operate on unusual signal representations that are incompatible with most standard deep network layers. This covered in detail in the revised related works section of the paper. In contrast, ARRN uses the most ubiquitous form of signal representation, and is compatible with almost all standard deep learning layers. We believe this is key to the usefulness of our method to the community, as it allows easily creating adaptive resolution methods that can leverage a wide range of existing techniques.\n\n**Q1)** The largest resolution in the experiments is 32 \\times 32. The CIFAR10 dataset is not suitable to evaluate ARRN.\n\n**A1)** We agree that evaluating methods across a larger space of resolutions is important. We have updated the experiments to cover the higher resolution TinyImageNet dataset, and also include a larger set of baseline methods spanning all usual variants of ResNet, WideResNetV2, MobileNetV3, and EfficientNetV2. Our method ARRN remains more robust at lower resolution than these standard methods while also beating their performance at the highest resolution. We would like to include the ImageNet dataset in our experiments however given limited time and computational resources we are not able to cover it appropriately. We believe our contribution is solid nonetheless as the novel properties of ARRNs are well supported by theory.\n\n**Q3)** The inference time seems excessive. How does ARRN compare to prior works in this respect?\n\n**A3)** The inference time of all methods is now included in Figure 6, as you requested. We apologize if it was not clear that we display the inference time not for *a single batch*, but for the *sum of all batches across the whole dataset*, excluding data loader overhead. While our implementation could be improved upon, ARRN achieves a reasonable inference time relative to prior methods that have had years of tuning from the community, and that are not burdened by the constraints imposed by adaptive resolution.\n\nLet us know if these updates to not address your concerns."
