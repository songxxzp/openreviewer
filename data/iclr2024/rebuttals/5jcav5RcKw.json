                    "value": "The paper introduces the Joint Autoregressive Mixture (JAM) framework, aimed at integrating large-scale pre-trained text and image models to generate cohesive multimodal outputs. Leveraging the architectural compatibility of autoregressive text-to-image models with Large Language Models (LLMs), the authors propose a systematic approach to model fusion and joint training. The JAM framework exhibits superior performance in generating high-quality multimodal outputs, integrating text and images seamlessly, and represents a significant step towards advanced multimodal conversational systems."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestions and valuable feedback, we address the different highlighted weaknesses and questions separately:\n\n> PPL is not defined anywhere in the draft.\n\nYou are correct in pointing out that PPL is not defined anywhere in the draft. We will fix this in the revised version of the manuscript to improve clarity of the presentation\n\n> Retrieval augmented presentation, the last section of page 4, can be improved. a small schema can be helpful.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion to enhance the clarity of the retrieval augmented presentation section. We recognize that a visual representation can significantly aid in the comprehension of the model's architecture and its retrieval mechanism. However we omitted it due to space constraints. We plan to improve the clarity of the procedure description in our revised version. \n\n> Instruction tuning lacks enough details. For example, in the introduction, the efficiency for even 1% of original pretraining data is stated but not mentioned anywhere else in the draft.\n\nWe appreciate your feedback on the need for more detail in the instruction tuning section of our paper. Our instruction tuning procedure is briefly described in Section 2.2 due to space limitations. We extend the discussion of this phase in the experimental details where we detail the training procedure and describe our WikiHow instruct tuning dataset creation and structure. We recognize the importance of elaborating on this critical aspect of our work and will expand this section in our revised manuscript. \nRegarding the reference to using just 1% of the original pretraining data in the introduction, we aim to clarify this in the revised version. This statement was intended to emphasize the efficiency of our model during the continued pretraining phase. Specifically, the 1% figure pertains to the amount of data used in aligning the two models, which amounts to 50 billion tokens. We will include this clarification in the updated version of the paper.. By doing so, we hope to underscore the data efficiency aspect of our method more prominently, illustrating how our procedure can be effective with a relatively small dataset. \n\n> Why does LLaMA have blanks in Table 1?\nIn Table 1, there are some blank entries under the LLaMa model, because it was not assessed in the original paper on certain benchmarks we included in our test. However, it's important to note that these particular benchmarks are not central to our primary comparative analysis.\n\n> Is Table 1 suggesting that 7B LlaMa is better than all the proposed JAM models in reasoning?\n\nWe acknowledge that our models, including JAM-Uniform, Width, and Cross, exhibit comparatively lower performance with respect to other baselines like GPT-3 and Llama 7b. This is partly due to our primary focus being on the integration and interplay of different modalities, rather than improvements on reasoning and understanding. It is worth noting that the reasoning performance of the JAM models is intrinsically linked to the capabilities of the initial language model we build upon. Thus, employing a more powerful language model (e.g Llama 7B/13B/70B) as the foundation model could inherently enhance the reasoning abilities of our combined model. This approach aligns with our method, which is designed to preserve and potentially amplify the intrinsic capabilities of the underlying models. Our current focus has been on developing a robust methodology for combining architectures pretrained on different trillion scale datasets, the goal is not to improve text reasoning/understanding, but to leverage the strong pretrained knowledge in our initial backbone.\n\n> Can we have the baseline results in Table 2 for the Wikipedia dataset as well?\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of including baseline results for the Wikipedia dataset in our comparison and appreciate your suggestion to add these to Table 2. In the revised version of our manuscript, we will incorporate the following updated table to provide a comprehensive overview:\n\n| Model             | Wikipedia PPL |\n|--------------------|----------------------|\n| LLM-4k           |          6.04         |\n| JAM-Uniform |          9.06         |\n| JAM-Joint        |          7.34         |\n| JAM-Cross      |          6.95         |\n\n\nThe other models, including CM3, RA-CM3, and CM3leon, are exclusively image-text models. As a result of their training, which predominantly involves a limited amount of text tokens, typically in the form of image captions, they do not perform as well in terms of Wikipedia PPL scores.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestions that helped us improve the quality and clarity of the paper."

The three ways of combining the two models are: 1. **Model Merging** in which the weights $\\theta\\_{llm}$ of $\\mathcal{T}\\_{llm}$ and the weights $\\theta\\_{img}$ of $\\mathcal{T}\\_{img}$ are averaged as initialization weights $\\theta\\_{avg} = 1/2 \\theta\\_{llm} + 1/2 \\theta\\_{img}$ for a model of the same parameter size (7B in the paper) (JAM-Uniform) 2. **Width Concatenation** in which the weight matrices are concatenated to form matrices of double size (per matrix dimension), both copying and averaging (JAM-Width) 3. **Cross Model Fusion** in which both  $\\mathcal{T}\\_{llm}$ and $\\mathcal{T}\\_{img}$ are augmented with cross-attention layers that permit a bi-directional flow of information, generalizing the Flamingo model (JAM-Cross). In each way, the authors train the resulting JAM model using the CM3 loss and perform instruction tuning using a small curated dataset of examples (following the LIMA paper)."

The authors suggest that minimal performance degradation post-merging should be studied in the evaluation part. While I agree minimal degradation is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient: given that the final model performs the same tasks as CM3leon, improving only 1.4 PPL points does not justify the necessity of jointly training with a text LLM."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestions and valuable feedback, we address the different highlighted weaknesses and questions separately:\n\n> While the experimental section is fair, pointing to a new state-of-the-art over CM3leon, the improvement is only 1.4 PPL points with an increase of the model size of more than double (19B vs 7B of CM3leon) and increased training time. The authors suggest that minimal performance degradation post-merging should be studied in the evaluation part. While I agree minimal degradation is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient: given that the final model performs the same tasks as CM3leon, improving only 1.4 PPL points does not justify the necessity of jointly training with a text LLM.  \n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's perspective on the performance improvements of our model over CM3leon. It's important to clarify that while our model indeed shows a modest improvement of 1.4 PPL points over CM3leon, the primary aim of our methodology extends beyond just enhancing this metric. Our goal with this evaluation was to facilitate comparisons between our model and other established autoregressive multimodal architectures, including RA-CM3, CM3, and CM3leon. This was done to ensure that the integration of our two backbones does not compromise their individual performance. On the other hand this work focuses on integrating diverse capabilities from different large-scale datasets. The core innovation lies in enabling the merged model to perform interleaved generation, a capability that our backbone, CM3leon, does not inherently possess. While CM3leon is adept in image-text tasks (captured by MS-COCO PPL) having been trained on a large corpus of image-text pairs, it lacks the nuanced common sense reasoning that is typically developed through extensive large scale text-only training (captured by common-sense reasoning benchmarks). Our model amalgamates these distinct abilities, thus not only retaining the image-text capabilities of CM3leon but also enriching it with the textual understanding characteristic of large language models (LLMs). The proposed approach results in a model with a broader spectrum of abilities, capable of seamlessly generating both images and text. Therefore, the value of our joint training approach with an LLM lies in creating a more versatile and comprehensive model, which we believe is a significant step forward in the field. The modest PPL improvement, while notable, is just one aspect of the overall advancements our model offers, particularly in terms of its expanded functional capabilities and the new avenues it opens for multimodal chatbots.  \n\n> Questions: \n> Shouldn\u2019t we have $H_{llm, l}$ and $H_{img,l}$ in Eq. 4 instead of $H_{llm, l}$ and $H_{llm, l}$?\n\nThis equation represents the bidirectional cross-attention mechanism in our model, where the query originates from the language model (LLM) and the key and values are derived from the text-to-image model. Specifically, '$H_{img,l\u22121}$' in the equation refers to the representation from the image-text model at the $(l-1)th$ layer, which is used in the calculation of '$H_{cross,l}$'.\n\n> \"We prevent the objective from masking across the modality <break> tokens.\": Does the CM3 objective relocate masks at the end of each modality or at the end of the total document?\n\nIn our implementation, as per the CM3 objective introduced by Aghajanyan et al. (2022), masks are relocated to the end of the entire document rather than at the end of each modality. Specifically, our model is designed to enhance its versatility for both infilling and standard autoregressive generation. By relocating masks to the end of the total document, our model can more effectively process and generate content that maintains the integrity of each modality, whether it be text or image. This design decision is aligned with the overarching goal of our model to seamlessly integrate and leverage multimodal data. We will clarify the masking strategy in the updated version of the manuscript. For a detailed explanation of this objective and its implications in multimodal learning, we refer you to the work of Aghajanyan et al. (2022), titled \"CM3: A Causal Masked Multimodal Model of the Internet.\"\n\n> What is $q$ in \u201cThe retriever takes an input query x and returns a relevance score $r(q,m)$\u201d, the authors intended the $x$ variable?\n\nWe apologize for the oversight, in our revised version, we will correct this inconsistency by consistently using 'q' to represent the input query throughout the paper.\n\n> We leverage our text-to-image backbone\u2019s modifications introduced in Yu et al.

Scaling up the model size could potentially help with the performance in terms of common sense reasoning and also generation.\n\nWe acknowledge that our models, including JAM-Uniform, Width, and Cross, exhibit comparatively lower performance in these aspects. This is partly due to our primary focus being on the integration and interplay of different modalities, rather than improvements on reasoning and understanding.\nRegarding the model size, we agree that JAM models are smaller than GPT-3. We recognize that scaling up the model size could indeed enhance its performance, particularly in terms of common sense reasoning and generation capabilities. We consider this an important area for future exploration. It is worth noting that the reasoning performance of the JAM models is intrinsically linked to the capabilities of the initial language model we build upon. Thus, employing a more powerful language model as the foundation could inherently enhance the reasoning abilities of our combined model. This approach aligns with our method, which is designed to preserve and potentially amplify the intrinsic capabilities of the underlying models.\nIn summary, while our current focus has been on developing a robust methodology for combining architectures pretrained on different trillion scale datasets, we are enthusiastic about the potential of scaling up our models and exploring more advanced foundational models to push the boundaries in reasoning and understanding in future iterations of our research.  \n\n> Single image generation:  \n> Interleaved generation is one innovation of this work.

We apologize for any confusion caused by the initial explanation. To clarify, when the modality <break> token is detected during the decoding process, our model indeed generates a single image. After this image generation, the model has the flexibility to either generate another modality <break> token, thereby continuing with text generation, or to produce an <eos> token, which concludes the generation sequence. Consequently, the number of text segments and images generated in a single run can vary, depending on the input. This flexibility allows for the generation of multiple images and text paragraphs within the same sequence. For instance, as demonstrated in Figure 1 of our paper, the model can produce sequences with two text paragraphs and two corresponding images. However, it is important to note that in most instances observed, the model tends to predict an <eos> token following the generation of a single image. The model is inherently capable of producing multiple images and text paragraphs in response to varying inputs, as showcased in some of our samples. We will clarify this in the revised version of our paper."

                        "value": "> Did authors compare their decoding strategy with contrastive decoding and clip-reranking, in terms of both efficiency and performance?\n\nRegarding interleaved generation we do not try contrastive decoding since our topp generation represents a good trade-off between quality and efficiency. However our model inherits the decoding properties of our backbone CM3leon. The authors of the CM3leon paper [1] propose to study the impact of decoding strategies in section 3.1 and we believe that, being CM3leon our base model, their findings generalize to our model as well.  Regarding CLIP-reranking, we faced practical constraints in its application for interleaved generation. The CLIP text encoder has a limitation in the number of input tokens it can process, and our model often generates text captions preceding images that exceed this maximum token length. Therefore, while CLIP-reranking offers certain advantages, its applicability in our context is limited due to these inherent constraints.  We also wanted to keep the model functionality as homogeneous as possible across modalities, handling both text and image generation uniformly, since our primary aim here is not to push SoTA on image quality.  Clearly, more complex modality-specific methods could be employed to improve the benchmark numbers.\n\n[1] Scaling Autoregressive Multi-Modal Models: Pretraining and Instruction Tuning, Yu et al. 2023.  \n\n> Can users control alpha_c, tao and other critical hyper-parameters during decoding? So the tool can be more balanced in generating text+image, or more leaning towards text or image generation.\n\nYes, users have the flexibility to adjust critical hyperparameters such as alpha_c, tao, and others during the decoding process. This level of control allows for customization of the decoding process tailored to specific needs. \n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestions that helped us improve the quality and clarity of the paper."

Indeed we debated this point while designing our experiments, but decided to go with an identical architecture to be able to compare to baseline methods such as weight averaging and width concatenation.  However, our proposed cross-model fusion method does not rely on this limitation.  It can be applied to any two base models, as long as they both use a transformer architecture.  We acknowledge that we did not run further experiments to verify the method more generally, which is a limitation of this work due to resource and time constraints.  Being an early work in this area, we chose to focus on an experimental setup which allows us more control over variables, so as to better inform future architecture choices in this domain.  Having established the cross-model fusion as a viable technique, we hope to focus future work on scaling and demonstrating this architecture in more practical settings.\n\n> Experiments seem too casual.\n> 1.

The rationale behind this was to first ensure that after the first alignment phase our model maintains the foundational capabilities of the original models post-merging. Our intention was to establish that the joint training does not detrimentally affect the individual performance of each component, a necessary precondition for effective multimodal integration.  While Table 1 and Table 2 are not our main results, we find that they are useful in discriminating between fusion approaches, since most baseline approaches will actually cause degradation in single-modality benchmarks.\n\n> 2.

The experiment quantity and quality is too bad to be a ICLR submission.\n\nWe acknowledge the complexity involved in evaluating text-to-image models, which guided our decision to utilize the MS-COCO dataset and Perplexity (PPL) as our primary metrics. We believe that this metric is a strong indicator of downstream performance for common downstream tasks of multimodal vision language models such as text-to-image generation, image captioning and so on, as evidenced by prior work.\nOur goal with this evaluation was to facilitate comparisons between our model and other established autoregressive multimodal architectures, including RA-CM3, CM3, and CM3leon. This was done to ensure that the integration of our two backbones does not compromise their individual performance. \nUnlike recent works such as Emu [1], which evaluates either text-to-image or image-to-text generation individually due to their model's constraint of producing only one modality at a time.  Our model uniquely generates multiple modalities simultaneously. Our focus is not on surpassing the text-to-image generation metrics such as FID, instead, our evaluation aims to demonstrate that our model maintains a comparable image-text performance level to our foundational model, CM3leon. However, we recognize that evaluating our model's unique capability of interleaved generation is challenging, as there are no established metrics for this task.  To address the absence of established quantitative metrics for interleaved simultaneous generation, we have placed a significant emphasis on thorough qualitative analysis.  The primary aim of our paper is not necessarily to achieve state-of-the-art results on existing single modality generation metrics,  but to demonstrate the successful merging of two distinct large-scale trained autoregressive models. This integration not only preserves the performance in their respective domains but also unlocks new capabilities in the realm of interleaved generation."
