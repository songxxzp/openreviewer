                    "value": "While the topic covered by the paper is important, I found that the paper was smeared with approximation, and not very clear about its technical content (to the point that I would not be able to reproduce the experiments, should I want to). This maybe due to the space restrictions, but not only (and even that would just mean that the paper should be done for a venue allowing for longer version, i.e., Journals or ArXiv): indeed, even with the appendices it would be hard to answer some questions/reproduce the methods/results, and some approximations made in the paper are not due to space limitations. Below are some more detailed comments. When those could lead to a potential comment/rebuttal from the authors, I have put a star (*) next to them (so that they can be considered questions to answer).\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n- (*)Semantic positioning: the authors are not always really clear as their interpretation of belief functions, and this should definitely be clarified, as in the current work the semantic and the resulting belief functions can have an important impact in practical application. for instance, it is suggested in the manuscript that obtained belief functions may be subnormalised, but it is also mentioned that decision rules issued from a probability set interpretation could be used to deal with decision oriented problems. Clearly, these two statements (without further clarification about the positioning) are logically inconsistent, as one cnanot use the imprecise probabilistic interpretation with sub-normalised BF. \n\n- (*)Focus on recent works on BF published in ML venues: the authors mention (multiple times) that BF was only recently applied to ML. This is rather true if authors means \"have recently appeared in ML focused top-tier venues\", but rather untrue if authors consider ML and statistical learning/inference as a field (and do not filter by venues). There is a huge literature on learning belief functions, and I would even argue that this is one of the main topic (with information fusion) on which belief functions has been applied (as opposed to other uncertainty theories, e.g., possibility theory that has mainly been considered for logical reasoning). The same is true for the \"uncertainty quantification\" community mentioned in P3, especially since \"uncertainty quantification\" or UQ for short covers a large group including classical risk analysis. My perception is that authors mean \"Uncertainty quantification in ML top-tier venues for the past 5 years\"... which is rather restricted as a span, IMHO. \n\n- (*)Lack of connection with potentially relevant streams of work: I would say that the current proposal should at least make a clear positioning with respect to two lines of work: the first one is about obtaining calibrated belief functions, a topic currently championed by Ryan Martin (who recently linked his work to CP), and the second one is that of adapting loss functions to credal labels, i.e., labels described by a probability set (see recent works, including some published in top-tier AI venues, by Julian Lienen on this topic). \n\n- (*)P1: authors mention instance-risk wise control, yet it is known (see \"The limits of distribution-free conditional predictive inference\") that obtaining full conditional coverage in a distribution-free setting is impossible. Whether authors are chasing that should be specified. \n\n- (*)P1: the part about epistemic/aleatoric is a bit loose. Imprecise data can definitely belong to epistemic uncertainty (and could be reducible in principle, as well as noisy data in the case where better sensors/measurement tools can be found), and I would question the idea that \"non-optimal training\" or \"ill-chosen\" hypothesis can be reduced by obtaining more data (even an infinite amount of data would not allow to change the hypothesis space, nor the fact that a learning procedure is sub-optimal). \n\n- P2: I am a bit skeptical about the use of set-vaued predictions in real-time setting, as set-valued predictions typically beg for a post-processing of some kind, rather than e.g., pessimistic decisions that can be directly plugged in uncertainty estimates. So the argument/connection looks at least a bit weak/irrelevant to me. \n\n- P3: it is strange to cite reject (Herbei/Wegkamp) just after a plea for conformal approaches, as if I am correct, the reject option proposed in this paper does not deal with calibration? \n\n- P4: strictly speaking, a Bayesian approach would put a prior over every possible proability values (typically a Dirichlet distribution), who would be uniform in case of no experiments, and rather skewed in case of presence of observations. The critic done there rather corresponds to the need to consider second-order models (mention after by the authors), of which Bayesian approaches constitute an instanciation. So here again, I would say that the argument is not very well crafted. \n\n- P5: while I agree that the full class set is always conservatively valid, it is not strictly valid in the sense sought by conformal prediction, that aims at turning equation (7) into an equality. \n\n- (*)Whole section 4: this whole section is not detailed enough so as to make the whole approach reproducible (and a look at the appendices indicate that the information cxannot be found in them either). For instance, I cannot really understand from the text 1. what is the quantity that is conformalised and 2. what are the used scores to conformalise it. In particular, if the conformalised quantities are the belief function (as I think it is), how are obtained the necessary ground-truth allowing to guarantee calibration? What is the random quantity against which we conformalise? What are the links between these loss functions and the recently introduced credal loss functions? \n\n- (*): P7: the claim that using belief could lead to a control of false positive would need to be exposed much more lenghtly. The connection is definitely not direct for the average reader, and I would say also for an expert reader. \n\n- (*)Experiments: experiments mainly shows that the proposed approach results in sets of smaller sizes, however there are at least two critics about them. The first is that they do not compare to all the recent works aiming at producing set-wise predictions (and referenced by the authors), the second is that it is not possible to find in the current publication (including in the appendices) graphs showing whether the proposed methods do actually produce caibrated predictions (in the sense of Equation (7))."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for taking the time to carefully read our manuscript and for valuable suggestions that help us improve our paper. We appreciate the literature suggestions that help us better put our work into context. In the following we respond to the raised questions / remarks one by one.\n\n>the authors are not always really clear as their interpretation of belief functions, and this should definitely be clarified, as in the current work the semantic and the resulting belief functions can have an important impact in practical application. for instance, it is suggested in the manuscript that obtained belief functions may be subnormalised, but it is also mentioned that decision rules issued from a probability set interpretation could be used to deal with decision oriented problems. Clearly, these two statements (without further clarification about the positioning) are logically inconsistent, as one cnanot use the imprecise probabilistic interpretation with sub-normalised BF.\n\nWe construct belief and plausibility values from the predicted mass values according to the (standard) construction rules in eqs. (3) and (4). We included an additional cross-reference  in the method section to remove any remaining unclarity.\nAs to the topic of subnormalisation, we were not explicit about it in the paper for two reasons: It rarely occurs and it is easy to deal with. We included an additional appendix to address subnormalisation and make the presentation of the method more complete. Here a synopsis of our answer:\nFor the $2^n$ dimensional DS classifier, training enforces the classifier to output (approximately) 0 mass for the empty set. Across our experiments, we didn\u2019t encounter data set with any substantial ($>10^{-2}$) amplitude in the empty set. To safeguard the approach against the possibility of empty set predictions, there are several mitigation strategies: First, one can simply reduce the output layer by the zero-set dimension. Second, one can slightly extend DST and interpret the empty set as OOD behavior, interpret it as conflict K and normalize the remaining mass outputs according to DS rule of combination (i.e., scale by $\\frac{1}{1-K}$). \nFor the reduced classifier, subnormalisation occurs more easily, though still rarely (see Figure 10). Since the output is here interpreted as singleton set plausibilities, subnormalisation indirectly implies mass assignment to the empty set. With an additional assumption that for cases where subnormalisation occurs the singleton set plausibility equals the corresponding mass estimates, a rescaling as outlined above can easily be done. In our experiments, however, we don\u2019t expect a significant impact due to the low occurrence frequency of subnormalisation.\n\n>Focus on recent works on BF published in ML venues: the authors mention (multiple times) that BF was only recently applied to ML. This is rather true if authors means \"have recently appeared in ML focused top-tier venues\", but rather untrue if authors consider ML and statistical learning/inference as a field (and do not filter by venues). [\u2026] I would say that the current proposal should at least make a clear positioning with respect to two lines of work: the first one is about obtaining calibrated belief functions, a topic currently championed by Ryan Martin (who recently linked his work to CP), and the second one is that of adapting loss functions to credal labels, i.e., labels described by a probability set (see recent works, including some published in top-tier AI venues, by Julian Lienen on this topic)\n\nIt is indeed regrettable that DST and works on belief functions (as many other methods!) only slowly diffuse from the statistics community to the machine learning community. In fact, the comments of the reviewer him-/herself and reviewers 1 and 3 in extension highlight the need for more ML publications exploring these (in the ML community at least) understudied concepts, as we do here. We are optimistic that the repertoire of today\u2019s ML capabilities will be extended by new approaches resulting from study of the intersection of these domains.\n\nThe aim of our literature overview is not to extensively review work on belief functions, but to provide necessary background to show the context in which this work was developed and provide interested readers with the links necessary to read up on background information. We extended the literature overview to also encompass more recent works on DST / BFs in ML."

We are thus a bit confused what the reviewer means by \u201ccite reject\u201d? It is separated from the discussion of works on conformal prediction semantically (from the paper: [foregoing discussion of set predictors] \u201cThe first one is [citations of conformal prediction works].

So here again, I would say that the argument is not very well crafted.\n\nSecond order models in general can capture epistemic (as well as aleatoric) uncertainty. However, necessary computational resources / latency times must be considered as well when crafting applications using such methods. The overlap of these two requirements in fact motivates our work \u2013 we point the reviewer to the corresponding paragraph in our introduction, which also includes Bayesian networks in its discussion.\n\n>P5: while I agree that the full class set is always conservatively valid, it is not strictly valid in the sense sought by conformal prediction, that aims at turning equation (7) into an equality.\n\nWe included a specification of our usage of the term \u201cvalid\u201d in order to avoid confusion."

What is the random quantity against which we conformalise? What are the links between these loss functions and the recently introduced credal loss functions?\n \nWe invite the reviewer to re-evaluate sections 4/5 (see second paragraph after equation 9) and appendices A and especially B.\n\nWhat is the quantity that is conformalised? \u2013 In section 4 we discuss how plausibility values are being used as calibration scores (and not belief values!). To be even more explicit, we dedicated appendix B to the calibration procedure. Calibration curves for all three approaches (full and reduced DS classifier, softmax classifier) are shown and explicitly identified as plausibility scores, as is written in the accompanying text.\n\nConcerning the question about ground truth values needed for calibration, these are easily accessible in our setting, as we deal with single-class classifiers. The classification settings are described in detail in the main text (section 5) and Appendix A. Generation of calibration scores can be found in Appendix B. Here we added an additional phrase bridging the nomenclature to set prediction papers, so that no confusion can arise. \n\n>P7: the claim that using belief could lead to a control of false positive would need to be exposed much more lenghtly. The connection is definitely not direct for the average reader, and I would say also for an expert reader.\n \nIn a format with restricted space as in the ICLR, it is not possible to discuss other utilizations of proposed methods at length. The sidenote of the connection of belief values as lower bound on the probability to false positive control stands in no connection to the main body of the text and, as the reviewer pointed out, may confuse readers. As such, we substitute the original formulation with a more general statement expressing possible other utilizations of credal set predictions, which extend beyond the demonstrations of the paper .\n\n>Experiments: experiments mainly shows that the proposed approach results in sets of smaller sizes, however there are at least two critics about them. The first is that they do not compare to all the recent works aiming at producing set-wise predictions (and referenced by the authors), the second is that it is not possible to find in the current publication (including in the appendices) graphs showing whether the proposed methods do actually produce caibrated predictions (in the sense of Equation (7)).\n\nConsidering the first point: As stated above and in the answers to the other reviewers, the main contribution of this paper is really the construction / training of DS classifiers and a scaled (reduced) version for lightweight uncertainty estimation, which is useful for precise set estimation under uncertainty. Referring to the answers of reviewers 1 and 3, we included an additional appendix showcasing the developed approach on toy data to further highlight its behavior also without calibration procedure. Further experiments on different applications utilizing epistemic uncertainty estimates (e.g., active learning) as well as in-depth discussions of connections to / benchmarking against existing set predictors are left to future work.\n\nConsidering the second point: With a rich literature of conformalized classifiers already in place, we felt that it would be a bit repetitive to put another plot showing that CP indeed achieves calibration coverage according to eq. (7). Nevertheless, we now included a plot showing calibratedness on our examples in Appendix B."

I apologize for this, but will take a closer look at the answers and changes to make a final recommendation. \n\n(quickly) looking at your new graphs in the appendix, I am really wondering about the plus-value fo the approach compared to just take the normalized p-values of classical conformal prediction interpreted as possibility distributions (see works of Martin and Cello on this)? I am also wondering to which extent the considered data sets are not \"easy\" calibration-wise, as a simple temperature scaling on a softmax seems to give quite satisfactory results in terms of claibration?\n\nBest regards"

For low predictive uncertainty, ...\" How to enforce an off-the-shelf machine learning classifier to have these properties? Moreover, how to make sure that the resulting function has the property that $h(A)\\le h(B)$ when $A\\subset B$? It seems that a basic classifier has to be tailored to achieve this property. Later on it stated that the approach \"is applicable to arbitrary network architectures\". I am afraid that I am entirely sold on this.\n\n2. On page 7, it stated that \"Here, we propose a restriction useful for the common case of false negative control by interpreting\nthe outputs of the model as the plausibilities of the singleton sets directly and hence do not need to compute them in a post-processing step.\" I am confused on two fronts.\n\n    2.1 The loss function in (8) involves the plausibility and belief outputs, which are computed from the mass (output of the basic classifier). To update the network, the gradient of the loss function has to be computed, which necessarily have to take the mass to the plausibility/belief computation into consideration. So it is not really a post-processing step, but rather a fairly integral step. Correct me if I am wrong.\n\n    2.2. For the second approach, it stated that \"The only adjustment to standard models in our second approach is that outputs are not normalized to 1.\" But later on the loss function is replaced as well. Do you mean that the basic classifier still has a $2^n$ dimensional output, but only $n$ components are used in the loss function (the rest are discarded), or do you mean that basic classifier has an $n$ dimensional output to begin with?

In this case, the only novelty in the second approach would be a half-new loss function with the CP in the end.\n\n4. The procedure ends with the CP applied to the plausibility. Here the plausibility is used merely as a conformity score. One can't help wonder if the result is due to CP or due to the choice of the score. Can we achieve similar performance if CP is applied to the softmax score or any other score of a standard $n$-dimensional classifier ($n$ is the number of classes)? In reverse, an ablate study is needed to see how the methods perform without the CP method in the end."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for carefully reading our paper and for detailed questions and helpful suggestions to further improve the presentation of our method. In order to address the questions concerning differentiation of full and reduced approach, we have updated Fig. 8 (former Figure 7) and Appendix C as a whole for better clarity and direct comparison between the full and reduced approach. Here are our responses to the other concerns and questions:\n\nRegarding 1.: \n> On page 6, section 4: It stated \"Our method promotes a basic classifier of any kind into a probabilistic set predictor h: X \u21922^Y that outputs a mass vector from DST, cf. Fig. 2. The function \u02c6h is expected to have the property that it assigns higher mass to larger sets for instances x with high epistemic uncertainty. In cases of high aleatoric uncertainty, ... For low predictive uncertainty, \u2026 How to enforce an off-the-shelf machine learning classifier to have these properties?\n\nOur approach enforces the desired properties by the suggested training procedure. I.e., it demands that the output layer of a basic probabilistic classifier (e.g., a standard NN with softmax activation in the output) is adapted. While off-the-shelf ML classifiers typically have $n$ output dimensions for an $n$-dimensional classification problem, the DS classifier proposed in our work requires to replace such an output layer by a $2^n$-dimensional output. That is done to match the number of elements in the powerset $2^\\Theta$ where $\\Theta =  \\{1, 2, \u2026, n\\}$ are the $n$ distinct labels or classes. In order to obtain meaningful probabilities or \u201cmasses\u201d as they are denoted in DST to all $2^n$ outputs and therefore enforce the classifier to have the mentioned properties (high epistemic unc. -> high mass on larger sets, high aleatoric unc. -> equally distributed mass across singleton sets) we introduce the loss function in eq. (8) with adjustable parameter $\\lambda$ that trades-off putting high mass on larger sets (small $\\lambda$) and putting high mass on smaller sets (large $\\lambda$). In that way, $\\lambda$ can be seen as an optimizable hyperparameter that reflects the degree of epistemic uncertainty.\n\n> Moreover, how to make sure that the resulting function has the property that h(a) \\leq h(B) when A \\subseteq B?\n\nIn our first approach we interpret the resulting function h(A) as mass function from DST, that only requires the mass function to be normalized, which we guarantee by using softmax activation on the output layer and the mass of the empty set to be zero, which is enforced by labels and the corresponding loss function. Since we want the DS Classifier to be able to express epistemic uncertainty by putting high mass on large sets, e.g., highest epistemic uncertainty is reflected by mass 1 on the full label set $\\Theta$, we explicitly don\u2019t want $h(a) \\leq h(B)$ when $A \\subseteq B$ in general. Note that the construction rules for belief and plausibility naturally ensure $bel(A) \\leq bel(B)$ and $pl(A) \\leq pl(B)$ for $A \\subseteq B$. \n\n> Later on it stated that the approach \"is applicable to arbitrary network architectures\". I am afraid that I am entirely sold on this.\n\nAs stated above, it is meant that it is applicable to arbitrary network architectures if the output layer is adjusted accordingly. We have incorporated this clarification in the updated version of the manuscript.\n\nRegarding 2.1: \n>The loss function in (8) involves the plausibility and belief outputs, which are computed from the mass (output of the basic classifier). To update the network, the gradient of the loss function has to be computed, which necessarily have to take the mass to the plausibility/belief computation into consideration. So it is not really a post-processing step, but rather a fairly integral step. Correct me if I am wrong. \n\nFor the full ($2^n$-dimensional) classifier, one indeed needs to compute belief and plausibility values during training, as can be done in a subsequent processing step following the construction rules (eqs. (3) and (4)). We have changed the wording to make the type of this processing clearer. \n\nNote that the reduced approach uses Equation (9) as loss function, which no longer utilizes belief values (as they are no longer available in the reduced approach). Here, no such subsequent processing step is necessary, as the outputs of the network are directly interpreted as plausibility values."

Do you mean that the basic classifier still has a 2^n dimensional output, but only n components are used in the loss function (the rest are discarded), or do you mean that basic classifier has an n dimensional output to begin with?\n\nWe indeed mean that the n-dim. DS Classifier has an n-dimensional output to begin with, whose non-normalized outputs are interpreted as plausibilities of the singletons from DST. That is, instead of being able to predict the entire credal set as the full DS Classifier (Fig. 2), the reduced n-dim. DS Classifier only predicts upper bounds on the probabilities, resulting in a probability simplex that is larger than the credal set (cf. updated Fig. 8) but still a reasonable estimate of epistemic uncertainty in many cases. Note that this reduction is necessary to break the exponential scaling of output layer parameters of the full classifier and thus unlocks the benefits of our approach also for larger classification tasks.\n\n>If it is the latter case, then the difference between the two approaches are more substantial. Moreover, the second approach would not be related to the Dempster-Shafer Theory at all.\n\nWe agree that the reduced approach no longer contains all information predictions of the full approach offer, but it still has a clear interpretation in DST. I.e., we interpret the outputs as plausibilities of the singletons from DST (mass of 1 on the full label set results in all singletons having a plausibility of 1). Predicting \u201clarger sets\u201d in that sense then reduces to predicting high plausibility on multiple singletons and \u201csmaller sets\u201d to only predicting only one singleton to have high plausibility.\nWe extended Fig. 8 in Appendix C and associated discussions to further elucidate the interpretation of the reduced approach in DST.\n\n> Moreover, if the \"post-processing step\" is removed for the second approach, then an updated graphic representation is needed in addition to Figure 2, instead of the two approaches sharing the same figure.

In this case, the only novelty in the second approach would be a half-new loss function with the CP in the end.\n\nThe main architectural difference between the proposed n-dimensional DS Classifier and standard ML classifiers is that the output in our approach is not normalized to one (e.g., by softmax activation) since we choose to apply a sigmoid activation function (all outputs are between 0 and 1, but their sum can be larger than 1). That is, the loss function for $\\lambda = 0$ (CE) pushes more weight to all outcomes as it does not penalize to put more weight to the plausibility of the wrong outcome (they are multiplied by zero due to the one-hot encoding of the labels). Therefore, all outcomes that predict a plausibility of 1 in the correct position minimize the CE, which is also the case for the full-label set, i.e., a plausibility of 1 on all singletons. Increasing the $\\lambda$-parameter in favor of the MSE will lead to a more focused / certain prediction with only high plausibility on one singleton set. We have updated the manuscript to achieve higher clarity on that by adding an explanation below eq. (9)."

                        "value": "Regarding 4.: \n>The procedure ends with the CP applied to the plausibility. Here the plausibility is used merely as a conformity score. One can't help wonder if the result is due to CP or due to the choice of the score. Can we achieve similar performance if CP is applied to the softmax score or any other score of a standard-dimensional classifier (n is the number of classes)? In reverse, an ablate study is needed to see how the methods perform without the CP method in the end.\n \nIn our numerical experiments we compare both of our proposed methods to a Standard NN classifier equipped with CP on the softmax scores and show empirically that we obtain smaller sets on average. It is right that this scoring function, although widely used in literature, is not the only choice. However, it was shown in previous work that standard softmax classifiers are not able to reliable capture epistemic uncertainty [https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/bengs23a.html] and therefore we would not expect that changing the scoring function of the same model yields smaller set sizes. \nFurther, we included an additional appendix (Appendix F ) containing a study on toy data designed to show the impact of epistemic uncertainty on DS and softmax classifiers. We not only clarify the connection to the observed improvements concerning FN control, but also explicitly show outputs before conformal calibration so as to disentangle the contribution of the two methods."

A probabilistic set predictor is a model that assigns probabilities to all possible subsets of outcomes. Two new losses to train such neural networks are introduced. Those are based on the concepts of belief and plausibility from DST. The output of such a model is combined with conformal prediction to produce calibrated set predictions. It is empirically shown that sets constructed with this method are on average smaller than those constructed with a basic classifier and conformal prediction suggesting that probabilistic set predictors from DST are better at quantifying uncertainty than basic classifiers."

They also derive a more computationally friendly variation, that only assigns plausibility scores directly to $n$ singleton outcome sets.

It seems that such an uncertainty framework is better used when epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty quantification is explicitly called for, such as in applications like active learning.\n\nWith respect to only measuring set size, this plausibility function simply reduces to another conformity measure, and it would be good to compare it to more competitive measures like RAPS, APS, conformalized bayesian outputs, or conformal methods such as jackknive+ that can adapt to changes in the calibration set by training.\n\nSome other minor comments:\n- In line citations are poorly formatted (should use \\citep)\n- The shadow fonts for p(A), p(B), P(C) are fairly strange (use normal font?)"

In the following, we address the comments one by one, to facilitate easy tracking of raised questions / points and our answers.\n\n> As noted in the text, the n-dim classifier loses the ability to distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty (since uncertainty is only able to be measured on the singletons, vs the larger sets)\n\nThat is true and one of the reasons why we are not applying it to settings in which a distinction is necessary. As was pointed out by the reviewer earlier, the full DS classifier could be employed in those scenarios like active learning or more general making decisions sensitive to the type of uncertainty. Nevertheless, the n-dimensional classifier is able to naturally capture epistemic uncertainty, which already extends the capability of softmax classifiers and may be useful to some applications (such as FN control as demonstrated here).\n\n> I understand that the softmax classifier would be at least a normalized version of this, but I'm not sure why it would completely switch its predictions in a way that assigns mass to a class completely ignored by the n-dim one (i.e., the {1} set).\n\nWe would like to point out that the n-dim. DS classifier differs to the softmax classifier not only in that it\u2019s output is not normalized, but also substantially in the training process. The hyperparameter $\\lambda$ in the loss function that we employ (eq. (9)) enables the ML practitioner to put more weight on \u201clarger sets\u201d, i.e., high plausibility on more than one singleton set (small $\\lambda$) or more weight on \u201csingleton sets\u201d, i.e., high plausibility on only one singleton during the training phase. That is, because while the MSE enforces a one-hot encoded plausibility prediction, the CE pushes more weight to all outcomes as it does not penalize to put more weight to the plausibility of the wrong outcome (they are multiplied by zero due to the one-hot encoding). Therefore, all outcomes that predict a plausibility of 1 in the correct position minimize the CE, which is also the case for the full-label set, i.e., a plausibility of 1 on all singleton sets. \n\n> This also seems intimately related to why it does worse in noised settings, as rather than being equally distributed between classes {0} and {2} (which would be the case if the logits of the n-dim classifer where simply softmax'd), it significantly reduces the mass on {0} in favor of {1} for some reason---and this should be what results in the quantile being poor.\n\nThe specific example in Fig. 3 has an illustrative purpose and is meant to emphasize that the DST-inspired loss function of the n-dim. DS classifier renders the model more robust under epistemic uncertainty as was empirically demonstrated by our experiments. We agree that this should be highlighted in the corresponding section and updated the manuscript correspondingly. \n\n> So I'm still not clear on why exactly this model \"can be expected to frequently attribute high probability to incorrect labels\", and the n-dim one is not (which will also lead to large set sizes if all labels have high scores).\n\nIn the presence of epistemic uncertainty, the softmax model is incapable of representing the full uncertainty of the prediction. Hence, overconfident and wrong predictions will occur. We hope that emphasizing the importance and interpretation of the loss function of the n-dim. DS classifier for such settings has cleared up some of the doubts. As stated above, we adjusted the manuscript to clarify these considerations."

                        "value": ">While I liked the basic idea of Dempster-Shafer theory and its interpretation w.r.t. epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty, these advantages seem lost when only measuring set size. It seems that such an uncertainty framework is better used when epistemic vs. aleatoric uncertainty quantification is explicitly called for, such as in applications like active learning. With respect to only measuring set size, this plausibility function simply reduces to another conformity measure, and it would be good to compare it to more competitive measures like RAPS, APS, conformalized bayesian outputs, or conformal methods such as jackknive+ that can adapt to changes in the calibration set by training.\n\nThe aim of our work is to establish a new method to train classifiers using Dempster-Shafer theory as lightweight approach to capture epistemic (as well as aleatoric) uncertainty. As such, we refrain from further use case specific demonstrations of epistemic uncertainty utilization such as for active learning or corner case detection, but instead strengthen our paper by an additional appendix (Appendix F) illustrating  the capability of our approach to capture epistemic uncertainty in a controlled toy setting and the connection to set sizes obtained after conformal calibration.\n\nNeedless to say, we make use of conformal prediction to demonstrate the usefulness of our epistemic uncertainty estimation for FNR control, but don\u2019t develop a new calibration procedure in itself, which motivates the limited comparison with other literature calibration methods and focus on the impact / successful description of epistemic uncertainty in the added appendix.\n\nOn a sidenote, the heuristically motivated regularization term of RAPS applies corrections on outcomes with smaller probability, as \u201cnoisy probability estimates [appear] far down the list of classes\u201d. Interpreting this noisiness as epistemic uncertainty, our DS Classifier would assign high mass in the smaller sets of more certain classes and smaller masses to other sets, which are then combined to give low belief, but relatively (compared to the probability estimate) larger plausibility values for the singleton sets of less certain classes (see, e.g., Fig.3). It seems that both approaches would lead to similar corrections to the calibration scores (compared to probability estimates as calibration scores), albeit with different interpretations. While interesting, we think a more detailed analysis of parallels between these approaches or the role of epistemic uncertainty for conformal prediction in general is best left for future work / out of scope for this paper."
