Your comments have been insightful and have certainly contributed to the refinement of our work. We appreciate the effort you have put into the review process. After carefully considering your comments, we would like to address the concerns and criticisms raised during the review.\n\n- **The paper introduces several unfamiliar terms such as \"TRAJECTORY STABILITY,\" \"Sensitivity,\" and \"Chaotic,\" without providing sufficient context or clarification.**\nIn Section 2 of the revised version, we provide a more detailed explanation of each term. \n\n- **The paper repeatedly emphasizes that the MDP framework can be reinterpreted as a controllable dynamical system.**\nThis was included to provide clarity in case the reader was unfamiliar with the relation between the MDP and dynamical systems. This definition is fundamental for measuring the stability of the control system so has been included to provide clarity.\n\n- **The paper is marred by poor writing and grammatical errors.**\nThis is something we have taken a close look at and have attempted to improve in the latest draft. \n\n- **Additionally, the results presented in Figure 5 are convoluted**\nWe appreciate this figure was unclear in the original text and have replaced it with a plot showing the mean and confidence interval. We have also extended this to the remaining environment to provide a more robust result.\n\n- **The proposed method of \"constraining all system states in the reward function\" is perplexing.**\nOur motivation for the constrained reward function was perhaps unclear in the original draft but this is something we have worked on for the revision. In the latest draft, we introduce a method for calculating the MLE of the reward over a trajectory and use this to identify if the reward function is stable, unstable or chaotic. We discover that constrained reward functions produce stable rewards with negative reward MLE however these results are limited to low-dimensional environments. The method of constraining the reward function for the Walker Stand task is then used to further demonstrate that a constrained reward function produces stable dynamics but now in high-dimensional systems.\n\nWe hope these revisions adequately address your concerns, and we believe they have strengthened the overall quality of our paper. We appreciate your thorough evaluation and constructive feedback, as it has contributed to the improvement of our research.\n\nThank you once again for your time and consideration."

By calculating the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) numerically, they show that simple environments with low dimensions are more robust with respect to the small perturbations to the initial conditions, while complex environments with high dimensions are prone to produce unstable chaotic dynamics. To solve this issue, the authors propose to redesign the reward function such that it counts all the system states. Experiment study shows that such modification reduces the MLE but sacrifices the agent performance."

                    "value": "The authors quantify the instability of the system by using the sensitivity of a dynamical system to the initial condition. However, a sensitive controller does not necessarily mean unstable from a control performance perspective. For example, Fig 1 shows sensitive dynamics, but it is hardly to be recognized as unstable. In addition, under the definition of sensitivity in this paper (Definition 1), a system seems very easy to be sensitive to since $\\beta$ is only assumed to be positive (can be arbitrarily close to zero), and they only require there exist a time step $k$ such that $\\| ^k u(s) - ^k u(\\hat{s}) \\| > \\beta$. \n\nThe modification of the reward function (2) is weak to me. In order to obtain reference value $\\bar{s}$, one has to run the standard problem first, this is rather inefficient. I believe such a method is not practical."

Your comments have been insightful and have certainly contributed to the refinement of our work. We appreciate the effort you have put into the review process. After carefully considering your comments, we would like to address the concerns and criticisms raised during the review.\n\n- **A sensitive controller does not necessarily mean unstable from a control performance perspective.**\nOur experiments show that instability in RL policies also causes instability in the rewards of those policies. To clarify this in the manuscript, we introduce a method for calculating the MLE of the reward over a trajectory and use this to identify if the reward function is stable, unstable or chaotic. We show that for simple low-dimensional environments, reward is stable with exponentially converging reward trajectories. Conversely, for high-dimensional environments, this reward is highly sensitive to initial conditions. As a result, policies which produce unstable state dynamics also produce unstable reward trajectories.\n \n- **The modification of the reward function (2) is weak to me.  In order to obtain reference value, one has to run the standard problem first, this is rather inefficient.**\nThis is perhaps something which we did not make clear in the original draft. In section 5 each agent is initially trained for 5 Million (SAC, TD3) or 10 Million (PPO) environment steps. This allows each policy to find a solution to the task and optimize this to attain a high reward. Having completed this training a reference value can be calculated for each policy and used for the constrained reward function. Each policy is then trained for a further 1 Million environment steps using this updated policy in order to improve the stability of the solution. In this sense, the proposed approach can be seen as fine-tuning the policy for stability\n \n- **In Fig 5, how to compute the MLE during the training phase?**\nDuring training a frozen copy of the control policy is combined with the control environment to produce a single, deterministic function which maps states to states. Using this update rule the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents is then calculated using the method outlined by Benettin et al and the MLE is taken as the largest value in the spectrum of Lyapunov Exponents. We have clarified this in Section 4.\n\n- **The MLE of the walker walk problem shown in Fig 5 seems inconsistent with the ones in Table 2, are they different sets of experiments?**\nThis inconsistency has been updated to reflect the results from Section 4. \n\nWe hope these revisions adequately address your concerns, and we believe they have strengthened the overall quality of our paper. We appreciate your thorough evaluation and constructive feedback, as it has contributed to the improvement of our research.\n\nThank you once again for your time and consideration."

Your comments have been insightful and have certainly contributed to the refinement of our work. We appreciate the effort you have put into the review process.

However, note that the selection of algorithms tested covers both on- and off-policy. In Section 4 we have clarified the definition of each model and specified if they are On Policy (SAC, TD3) or Off Policy (PPO).\n\n- **Please define the co-domain A of the function/policy \\pi in section 3.**\nThis definition has been added to Section 3. \n\n- **What are the precise states s that were used to compute the dynamics characteristics in the experiments?**\nThe states used to calculate the Lyapunov Exponents are taken from sample trajectories with minimum length 200 and maximum length 800. This allows the trajectories to reach any chaotic attractors while still remaining in their training data distribution. We have updated section 4 to clarify this point.\n\n- **From figure 2, it seems like PPO has difficulties solving CR. Is this why in figure 4 we see PPO having an unusually high MLE for CR?**\nWhile the lower performance of PPO does have an impact on the dynamics produced by the Cheetah Run environment, we have also found that the sum of all the Lyapunov exponents is positive which indicates diverging dynamics. As a result, the trajectories for this system are not bound by a chaotic attractor and can diverge indefinitely in the phase space. This lack of converging dynamics allows for a larger MLE. \n\n- **Please expand figure 5 to include the other tasks as well.**\nThis figure has been updated to include the other environments. Furthermore, the raw values have been replaced with the mean and standard deviation at each time step to provide clarity. \n\nWe hope these revisions adequately address your concerns, and we believe they have strengthened the overall quality of our paper.

However, *it is not clear whether stability, in the way it is defined in the paper, is actually a desirable characteristic of RL policies*. \n\nAs a concrete example, let us consider walker stand. In the default version of the environment, the system state include features such as the agent's angle of the foot joint. which is not used the the reward function (reward is only dependent on torso height and angle). As a result, RL policies, given different initial conditions, may control the agent to position its foot joint in different angles while maintaining a standing position. This behavior will lead to consistently high reward across different initial conditions, while yielding a low stability score (as defined by the Maximal Lyapunov Exponent), because the stability score will punish the policy for putting the agent's foot at different angles in different trajectories. Moreover, the paper's proposed method of modifying the reward function will minimize this behavior by incentivizing the policy to always put the agent's foot in the same angle, which will lead to a higher stability score. However, it is not clear that this \"stable\" behavior is actually desirable. In the example of walker stand, the angle of the foot joint is not part of the reward function, because it *doesn't matter* for the performance of the task. In the current results in the paper, improving stability via the modified reward function does not consistently lead to better performance (in terms of the reward), so it is not clear why measuring and improving stability is meaningful or significant."

Our experiments show that instability in RL policies also causes instability in the rewards of those policies. To clarify this in the manuscript, we introduce a method for calculating the MLE of the reward over a trajectory and use this to identify if the reward function is stable, unstable or chaotic. We show that for simple low-dimensional environments, reward is stable with exponentially converging reward trajectories. Conversely, for high-dimensional environments, this reward is highly sensitive to initial conditions. As a result, policies which produce unstable state dynamics also produce unstable reward trajectories.\n\nWe hope these revisions adequately address your concerns, and we believe they have strengthened the overall quality of our paper.
