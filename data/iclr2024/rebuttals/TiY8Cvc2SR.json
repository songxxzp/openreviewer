The experimental methodology is rigorous with a 5 fold CV performed over all 3 datasets. This has been missing in some previous SOTA works for MIL.\n3. Writing style is crisp and clear."

All the problems picked here are binary classification problems, how does this framework generalize to multi-class problems such as RCC subtyping in the TCGA dataset?\n3. The potential reduced performance of the IIS score on challenging datasets and sensitivity to params like maximum pseudo bag number might indicate that it might require relatively more hyperparameter tuning and prior knowledge about the problem for newer datasets.\n\n\n[1] - \"Additive MIL: Intrinsically Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Pathology\", NeurIPS 2023."

This formulation implements pseudobags where M subset of tiles inherit the bag level label for training. The clever augmentation to this frame work is the use of the so called instance importance score (IIS), which is based on the Shapley value where tiles are removed and the relative loss of predictive power by removal of important tiles is measure.   To improve efficiency the authors  only tiles with relatively high attention scores were evaluated for the IIS. With IIS scores for these patches ranked, pseudobags can be seeded sequentially with high IIS scores making it more likely that each pseudobag will have positive tiles if the initial bag is in fact positive. This process is done iteratively to optimize the number of pseudobags (M).  Using this method shows modest improvement of performance on benchmarking datasets. Some introspection is demonstrated, including the relative performance of the model on the three datasets with different level of maxM."

I have found that Shapley-based importance metrics are much better at providing some explainability to models than some other methods so seeing this applied on the aggregation function in MIL strikes me as a potential step in the right direction. \n\nIt is important to note that the attention weightings from aggregation function is useful but does consistently have confusing and spurious results if overly relied on.  An improvement on identification of the most important tiles for classification can potentially result in better whole slide classification and better explainability. \n\nThe submission is written very clearly and weaknesses are appropriately acknowledged."

How can you be certain that these tiles are not important for the prediction task in a way that is not obvious? For example there may be some stromal response that indicates cancer is present but not in that specific tile. \n\nCan you regenerate Fig1 and demonstrate that rank of IIS does enrich better for tumor tiles? \n\nCan you double check the legend for figure 4 is more clear.  It appears on a) that the ground truth image that green is not tumor or is perhaps the outline of the tumor.  The attention maps (red) appear to be labeling tumor correctly.  But legend does not clearly articulate what the colors mean in the attention/IIS heatmaps."
