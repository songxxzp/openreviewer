They  focus on  modifying the computation graph itself. The idea is to have two phases. First phase, to learn a model(could be MLP, GNN etc.) that  learns the representations of nodes which allows  constructing new computation graphs. Phase 2 ) Utilizing  representations oh phase 1 to consstruct new computation graphs for the GNN. Their proposal of modifying the computation graph enforces messages to be sent across additional pairs of nodes based upon similarity of nodes( from phase 1).\n\nThe paper is easy to follow. Pseudocode etc. is provided. Empirical performance is mostly superior.  The authors also provide visualizations to enhance better understanding of their approach..\n\n\n[A]Oleg Platonov, Denis Kuznedelev, Michael Diskin, Artem Babenko, and Liudmila Prokhorenkova.\nA critical look at the evaluation of gnns under heterophily: are we really making progress? arXiv\npreprint arXiv:2302.11640, 2023"

In fact, there are several follow ups to this work [B, C, D]. Strangely, [A] is part of the citation, but there is no discussion related to [A] anywhere in the write up.\n1. **Baseline Hyperparameter Tuning:** The baseline numbers are not looking very reliable and there is question as to whether these baselines have been tuned properly. Not tuning baselines correctly has been found to be an issue in the past [E, F]. In fact, similar comments have been raised on the paper where the datasets considered in this paper were proposed [G]. Just as an example, with some amount of tuning, we were able to get 71.97 for GPRGNN model on roman-empire, which is higher than the reported 64.85.\n\n* [A] Learning Discrete Structures for Graph Neural Networks, ICML 2019.\n* [B] Iterative Deep Graph Learning for Graph Neural Networks: Better and Robust Node Embeddings, NeurIPS 2020.\n* [C] GLAM: Graph Learning by Modeling Affinity to Labeled Nodes for Graph Neural Networks, ICLR 2021.\n* [D] A Survey on Graph Structure Learning: Progress and Opportunities, arXiv 2022.\n* [E] Pitfalls of Graph Neural Network Evaluation, NeurIPS 2018.\n* [F] Pitfalls in Evaluating GNNs under Label Poisoning Attacks, ICLR 2023.\n* [G] https://openreview.net/forum?id=tJbbQfw-5wv"

In particular, some methods like Suresh et al. (2021) consider the similarity based on the graph structure. Thus, they are similar to the struc2vec variant of EGC. According to Tables 3 and 4, struc2vec is competitive and often outperforms other approaches.\n \n2. **Motivation.** The main motivation for graph rewiring is improved homophily For instance, it is written in the introduction \"If the similarity metric is favourably chosen, such a computation graph will improve the overall homophily statistics, thereby creating more favourable conditions for GNNs to perform well.\" However, among the considered auxiliary models, only MLP clearly creates homophilous graphs. This is supported by Table 5, where BGRL-ECG has low homophily. Thus, some considered auxiliary models do not improve homophily but still work well, while MLP is rarely the best auxiliary model.\n \n3. **Complexity overhead.** The proposed approach is significantly more complex since it requires additional models to be trained and more budget for parameter tuning. In Table 1, the chosen auxiliary model is a hyperparameter, so all of them need to be implemented and compared. Moreover, while not mentioned in the main text, some complex auxiliary models are used: MLPBGRL and MLP\u2192GNN."

However, existing methods such as WRGAT [1] also use a similar pipeline where graph construction and learning are separated into two stages. The four embedding extraction methods used in step 1 are intriguing, but the paper only introduces them without justifying their advantages and disadvantages compared to each other and methods in the literature.\n\n\n2. The evaluations of the proposed method are insufficient.\n\n\t- Hyper-parameters: There are many settings that could affect performance, such as embedding methods and neighbor number k, which are treated as hyper-parameters. Particularly for the embedding methods, it seems that the performance reported in Table 1 is selected based on test performance. Table 4 reports the test performance of ECGs with different embedding methods, and the highest ones are selected and reported in Table 1. If the authors treat the embedding methods as hyper-parameters, they should select the appropriate choice with the **validation performance**. If they are not hyper-parameters, the authors should justify why these choices are selected.\n\n\n\t- Performance analysis: The performance analysis is conducted based on Table 1. However, based on Table 4, lower performance compared to vanilla GNN methods can be observed, indicating the insufficient expressiveness of the designed method.\n\t\n\t- Baseline selection: This paper focuses on reconstructing graph structures, and related methods such as Geom-GCN and WAGAT[1] should be considered as baselines, similar to the usage of H2GCN. The statement \"However, in both cases, the input node features and labels, which could provide useful signal, are not used.\" needs clarification.\n\t\n\t- Limited datasets: Five datasets are insufficient to evaluate the effectiveness of ECGs. The large-scale datasets mentioned in [2] should be considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Breaking the Limit of Graph Neural Networks by Improving the Assortativity of Graphs with Local Mixing Patterns.
