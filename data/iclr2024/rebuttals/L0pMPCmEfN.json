Application to Parkinson\u2019s disease is also studied."

Could you explain show equation 1b in section 4.can give a closed form solution of theta(t)? Is it specific to wavelet transform W? What is the bias you are referring to in Remark 4.2? What is this set {1,4,7,\u2026} in Data synthesis part of Section 5? \n-\tTypo: statement in prop 3.1, inf over lambda_n instead of lambda? theta_k in eq 6a should be theta(k)?\n-\tI think it would make more sense to compare with W theta^{star,s} in Fig 1 rather than with the noisy data y on top row.

An optimization problem to be solved, or the modification to the solver, is not stated. The role of the function $$\\rho$$ introduced is not clear. The theorems state how large a coefficient needs to be to be estimated accurately by the proposed method, but there is no discussion as to whether this guarantee is informative for cases of interest.\n\nSeveral instances of notation (e.g., $$\\theta^{*,s}$$, $$a$$ in Theorem 4.3) are not defined in advance."

For any approach, however fine, there will always be a small amount of noise or a small meaningful signal that you won\u2019t be able to estimate and (2) the fact that the comparison to the soft thresholding approach could be minimal (i.e. despite the strict inequality which is interesting I have to say, If I'm not wrong, there is no intuition on how much of an improvement we get)\nGenerally speaking, the paper lacks clarity and has to be rewritten. The figures are too small and there are way too many details in the probabilities that appear in the main results (see my detailed comments below). I'm open to discussion but there is some work to be done."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "A couple of general comments:\n\n- From the very beginning of the paper, you talk about differential inclusion but never properly introduce the concept. This makes the whole paper unclear, plus isn\u2019t a differential inclusion a system of the form dx/dt \\in S for some S ? where the inclusion is defined on the derivative, and not on the function ?\n- Try to simplify your mathematical statements as much as possible. You want them to convey a message as clearly as possible. For the moment, you provide too many details \n-We don\u2019t really know by how much you can improve the simple soft thresholding estimator. \n-If your error bounds hold for every t>\\overline{tau} you should clearly say it \n\nIntro, page 1 and 2\n\n-End of the page: \u201cit is desired to identify the strong signal\u201d \u2014>  \u201cit is desirable\u201d\n\n\nPage 3\n- From what I understand, W is your inverse wavelet transform (I think it would be more clear to sate it like this, even though W might be equal to W^{-1} since the transform is orthogonal)\n- To me it does not really make sense to consider zero coefficients if you add noise. How can you make the distinction between coefficients vanishing because of the noise and because they are naturally meaningless ?\n- I would add a sentence before Proposition 3.2. E.g. \u201cconsidering small coefficients does not affect the minimax threshold\u201d\n- Also, there is a problem with your statement of Proposition 3.2., doesn\u2019t the minimax error depend on  the level of noise? if there is no noise, how can the minimax error be zero for small coefficients? \n- What is theta^{*, s} ? from what I understand this is the part of theta that is left after retaining only the coefficients from S? \n- Below the statement of Proposition 3.1. you say that the Donoho and Johnstone estimate is biased because of the non zero lambda. What about vanishingly small lambda\u2019s ?\n-The sentence \u201cdisentangle the strong signal apart\u201d is not clear. Do you mean recovering the strong signal from the measurements ? or extract this signal from the measurements?\n\nPage 4\n- Formulation (1) does not look like the formulation in [5] to me \n- I\u2019m not sure I understand proposition 4.1. It seems you never recover theta^* ? I.e the best solution you get is $omega_j$ which is the noisy part? \n- The paragraph below Proposition 4.1. is unclear. I might be missing something but the gradient is not the same thing as the bias. In your explanation, I feel there is some confusion between the gradient and the bias. What is the point of ending with theta_j = omega_j if omega_j is noisy ?\n- \u201cthat different from\u201d \u2014> \u201cthat unlike\u201d\n- In the statement of Theorem 4.3. Is it for every t>\\overline{tau} or does the inequality only hold at one specific time ?\n\nPage 5\n- You keep mentioning that when the modulus of rho(t) is one, the (distributional) derivative is zero yet you never explain this in detail. From 3b, it is not clear to me why a modulus of 1 implies a vanishing derivative\n- \u201cMAP\u201d stands for maximum a posteriori not maximum a posteriori probability. Btw you should remove this line, this is a well known fact and given how short you already are regarding space, I would avoid losing space unnecessarily \n- In the statement of Theorem 4.6., again you lose space unnecessarily by completely expanding the details of your probabilities. Hide this inside asymptotic notations and keep the details for the appendices.\n- In the statement of Theorem 4.6. I find the notation 1-a_0 a little dangerous. If a0 can be arbitrarily close to 1 I think you should just remove it as it is upper bounded by the fourth term anyways, it is not really meaningful\n\nTheorem 4.6.\n-The use of parentheses is not clear in the 7th term \n- Again, does the error bound hold for one \\overline{tau} or for all t>tau ?\n- The second item is not clear. Do the two bounds hold simultaneously ? Then why not use || \\overline{theta}(tau) - theta_T^* || < min(\u2026) ?\n- I also have a problem with the general bound on theta(\\overline{tau}). You show that your estimator does better than soft thresholding. I give you that. But how well? it is not even clear if it is a minor or a major improvement. Is there a multiplicative constant ? What does this constant depend upon ?\n- Is theta^{*,s} the same as theta^*_S ? This is not clear\n- In (4), why can you say that |theta^s - theta^{*,S}| = |theta_S - theta^{*,s}_S|, what is theta^{*,S} ? is this the same as theta^{*,s} ?\n- Also, after the statement of Theorem 4.6. you claim that you better estimate the components on T. Again, this is not clear to me.Why does the fact that you improve over the rho = 0 or rho = infty imply that you do better regardless of the value of rho ? I.e how can you guarantee that there is no value of rho/lambda for which the soft thresholding approach will recover a better bound than yours?"
