In terms of the subjective indicator (MOS), the Vocoder proposed in this paper slightly exceeds HifiGAN and other Diffusion-based Vocoder (such as WaveGrad and FastDiff)."

In theory, the model incorporates the use of a patch-wise token and the Transformer architecture for effective modeling of global information in noisy speech. This helps in capturing the contextual dependencies and improves the overall synthesis quality.\n\nSecondly, from Table.1 in the experimental part, we can simply think that the newly proposed Vocoder has reached a new SOTA in terms of MOS."

The authors just apply Rectified-Flow to the audio field, and there is nothing new in machine learning theory. However, it is a pity that some works have already applied Flow-matching technology into the audio field, such as [1].\n\n[1] Voicebox: Text-Guided Multilingual Universal Speech Generation at Scale\n\n## Weakness 2\nThe experimental part of the paper is not convincing. \n\n  For eg.\n\n  HIFI-GAN V1 3.94\u00b10.08 (MOS)\n\n  LinDiff (1 steps) 3.99\u00b10.06 (MOS)\n\n  It is difficult to say that it has an advantage over the HiFiGAN model (LinDiff only gains 0.05\u00b10.08).\n\nHIFI-GAN V1     2.08 (MCD\u2193)\n\nLinDiff (1 steps) 2.17 (MCD\u2193)\n\nLinDiff is worse than HiFiGAN in terms of objective indicators.\n\n## Weakness 3\nThe authors mentioned that this paper uses Transformer structure to model waveform for the first time, and the advantage of this structure is \"capturing the contextual dependencies\", so why is there no relevant experiment to prove the superiority of Vocoder over other Vocoders in contextual modeling?\n\n## Weakness 4\nIn the current research environment, LjSpeech, a small lightweight dataset, is no longer enough to verify the superiority of the model (because everyone's scores are very high). Table 3 reveals that LinDiff performs poorly on large datasets such as Libritts."

As for the ODE formulation, apart from the proposed formulation, there exists many other formulation (e.g., ODE in Grad-TTS/NaturalSpeech 2 and the original DDPM), which can also predict the ground-truth waveform. I think ablation on formulation (while keep the GAN and Transformer predictor be the same) is necessary to verify the contribution of proposed formulation.\n\n2. As for the noise predictor, it is necessary to compare Transformer-based predictor with the convolutional based predictor (e.g., WaveNet based or Unet based) while keep the GAN and ODE formulation be the same to verify the effectiveness of Transformer-based predictor."

According to the size in Section 3.4, it seems that the waveform is transformed to 256-dim STFT before formulating batch? \n\n2. Since patch seems to be a very sensitive parameter, it will be better if the ablation study on patch can be more detailed to show the trade-off (adding experiments of patch=16 and 32)."

(4)) in section 2 that does not contribute to the design of LinDiff. These formulas might sidetrack and, to a large extent, hinder readers' understanding. A quick fix would be to cite the contents from another paper and only keep the most influential ones (e.g. Eq. (8)). Besides, I cannot find the training loss for stage 1 in Algorithm 1, please correct it for a self-contained presentation. Also, I suggest to bold all vectors and matrices, following the usual practice of ICLR papers, to differentiate them from the scalars. \n\n**More ablations**: I am also skeptical of the contribution of different novel points to the final performance of LinDiff, including the new architecture, three-stage training and the use of adversarial loss. Especially concerning the new architecture, I recommend the authors to compare it with some widely used architecture, e.g., UNet1D, or DiffWave. I believe objective measures such as MCD would be sufficient to confirm the superiority of the proposed architecture."

For example, using Transformers as the backbone of diffusion is not necessarily necessary, and authors should compare it with CNN-based architectures. In fact, I don\u2019t think using a framework like VIT is necessary for the task of vocoder. Adding self-attention to CNN architectures (e.g. WaveNet) may have similar results.\n\n3. The experimental results did not show obvious improvement. In the case of single-step diffusion, MCD, V/UV, and F0 CORR are not as good as HIFIGAN. Note that HIFIGAN is no longer a strong baseline in the vocoder field.\n\n4. Comparisons of objective measures of diversity deserve further discussion. I think for the task of vocoder, diversity is not an important evaluation criterion, and it may not make any difference to people's sense of hearing."
