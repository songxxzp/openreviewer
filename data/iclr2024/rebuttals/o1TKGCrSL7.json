                    "value": "*Note that this manuscript was previously submitted to NeurIPS 2023, where it was withdrawn following scores that would have likely led to rejection. I was assigned a reviewer for this paper at the time as well, and from what I can tell the paper remains entirely unchanged. Hence, I am going to take the liberty of resubmitting my previous review entirely unchanged as well.*\n\nThis paper addresses the problem of subgroup robustness, i.e., the concern that a model shows markedly worse performance for specific subpopulations. Note that a subpopulation here is defined across both label and input space. Mathematically this translates to $\\min_\\theta \\sup_{Q\\in\\mathcal{Q}}\\mathbb{E}_{Z\\sim Q}[\\ell(\\theta,Z)]$ where $\\mathcal{Q}$ is a set of subpopulations and $\\ell$ is the loss for a given sample, $Z$, and parameters $\\theta$. That is, the goal is to maximize the worst-case performance of the classifier over all subpopulations.\n\nThe suggested approach in this paper relies on a vision-language model: The language model is used to describe the subpopulations in input space. For example, if subpopulations are defined as blond/not blond (label space) men/women (input space), then \"a photo of a man/woman\" (\"debiasing prompt\") is fed and used to generate embeddings $T(\\hat{t}_i)$ (see equation 4). An adapter $A$ is then trained to \"debias\" the vision embeddings, which means that the embeddings lie equally far from all $T(\\hat{y}_i)$ (e.g., it is no longer possible to tell the gender from the image features). At the same time, a consistency loss using the un-adapted features ensures that embeddings don't collapse.\n\nThe idea here is that if the classes are balanced (e.g., there are as many blond as not blond people in the dataset) and the vision features are debiased (e.g., there is no more information in there about gender) then the performance of the classifier must end up being equal across all of the (four) subpopulations (blond/not blond men/women).\n\nExperiments show significant improvements in the worst-case accuracy for all models except ViT-L/14 on the CelebA dataset (subpopulations are blond/not blond men/women) and the Waterbirds dataset (subpopulations are waterfowl/landfowl in the air/on land). Experiments show that several hundred/thousand examples are needed to see improvements over the baseline (i.e., no debiasing).\n\nA few other experiments show that the method can be used in conjunction with other methods (e.g., CVaR-DRO and $\\chi^2$-DRO) and that it is possible to debias multiple attributes at the same time."

                    "value": "The proposed idea is appealing in its simplicity: A vision-language model can be used to describe which attributes should be protected/robust (e.g., male/female) and an adapter is quite directly trained to remove these features entirely from the image features.\n\nThe experimental results are encouraging. Improvements seem reliant on prompt engineering and not all improvements are equally large, but they seem consistent."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "The main strength of the method also seems like a weakness: It relies on a multi-modal model to provide the zero-shot learning capability needed to identify subpopulations in the label space. This makes the method pretty specific.\n\nA concern regarding the applicability of this method is that the experiments show that this approach requires significant prompt engineering. But the assumption in this paper seems to be that there are no labels available (e.g., no male/female labels). That means that it wouldn't be possible to compare the performance of prompts like it was done, e.g., in table 1, right?\n\nAll in all, I don't think this is a bad paper. The idea is clean and simple, and the results show that it works. However, I'm wondering if the idea is fleshed out enough, and it leaves me with several practical questions: How does one select a debiasing prompt when there is no ground truth labels? Can I use multiple debiasing prompts? How do I know if I have enough data? I am not sure if all these questions should be left to future work (I think these are more important than questions about how L-DRO interacts with other methods, for example). This is why I am recommending a weak reject."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "Some questions:\n\n* Did the authors explore why their model fails on ViT-L/14? This seems like useful information for practitioners. For example, can they only expect this model to work on smaller models?\n* My understanding is that the results in table 6 should be comparable to the 3rd and 7th rows in table 2? There zero-shot learning gets 70.6% worst-case performance. It seems that $\\chi^2$-DRO is the only baseline that gets higher than this (but with huge variance)? It seems odd that all the DRO methods do worse than not doing anything at all?\n* Assuming that it's not possible for a practitioner to select the best prompt based on validation results (since no ground truth labels are available for the subpopulations) it would be useful to know if the method can be extended to support multiple debiasing texts. That is, rather than having to select a single debiasing prompt and hope it is correct, the user could just give many different ones, increasing the chances of having good results (since the spread is quite large, as is evident in table 1).\n* I'm surprised at the results in table 3, which seem to suggest that if the dataset isn't large enough, the proposed method actually harms the results. I would find it useful if the authors could (1) provide insight into why this is the case, and (2) provide some guidance on how a practitioner is supposed to know whether or not they have enough data available for this method to apply.\n\nMinor things:\n\n* It seems odd that all the prompts selected are grammatically incorrect. How does the model perform with correct phrases such as \"a photo of a blond/non-blond person\"/\"person who is blond/not blond\" and \"a photo of a man/woman\"/\"male/female person\"?"

                        "value": "Weakness and Question 3\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that  there are challenges in selecting appropriate text prompts when dealing with language (text) related deep models,  and varying text prompts have a significant influence on the final performance, and this work does need a domain explicit validation dataset to guarantee reasonable worst-case performance, as mentioned in Section 3.2 and Section 5 (Experiment) and employed by related work in this line of research. (JTT and $\\chi^{2}$-DRO generally use this validation dataset for another purpose, detailed in \u2018stable worst-case accuracy across training epochs\u2019 paragraph of section 5.1).\nHowever, our solution enables fine-tuning an extra adapter (in the last layers) with language guidance to mitigate subpopulations in the label space, which follows the trend of the broader and broader application scenarios of the (large) multi-modal models. We believe this type of condition closely satisfies real-world conditions instead of assuming it is a specific condition.\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\nPlease refer to Appendix C, we have explored the failure mode on ViT-L/14. The root cause is the inconsistency of the effectiveness of text prompts over various models. Employing a prompt that is different from the default one achieves a more reasonable performance, it shows that the proposed method outperforms other baselines, as shown in Table 10.\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\nTable 6 empirically verifies the potential of L-DRO to help stabilize the existing methods since they are orthogonal, and it demonstrates that the proposed method embedded with other baselines generally improves the performance with CelebA but worsens it with the Waterbirds dataset. And, it is not surprising that some baseline methods actually worsen the performance compared with zero-shot performance such as ERM and JTT. Actually, it is well-established that inappropriate fine-tunings damage the distributional robustness of pre-trained models [1,2,3],  which is also mentioned in the introduction. \n\nIt should be noted that parameter-efficient tuning, such as tuning the final layers only, demonstrates popularity under certain large model conditions. The existing work of DRO such as JTT typically tunes the whole model.\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\nIt is true that training with fewer data points or data that are not enough to represent the whole distribution manifest performance decreasing. When data is not enough to represent the whole distribution, then the updating direction is hard to find the right one or even in the opposite direction.\nTable 3 shows the proposed method is data efficient and is possibly due to its parameter-efficient structure.\n\n\n\n[1] Mitchell Wortsman, Gabriel Ilharco, Jong Wook Kim, Mike Li, Simon Kornblith, Rebecca Roelofs, Raphael Gontijo Lopes, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Ali Farhadi, Hongseok Namkoong, et al.

This is achieved by learning a vision feature adaptor, which is trained by minimizing equation (4) with debiasing prompts. This will encourage the inability to distinguish across sub-population while maintaining a representation space consistent with the learned space. Utilizing the debiased vision representation alongside the original task-relevant classification prompt enhances worst-case accuracy and also yields benefits for average accuracy."

Please see our responses below;\n\nWeakness\n\nWe admit the challenges in designing debiasing guidance from other modalities instead of language modality. And, our solution enables fine-tuning an extra adapter in the last layers with language guidance to mitigate subpopulations in the label space, it follows the trend of the broader and broader application scenarios of the (large) multi-modal models, relying on the guidance from natural language in learning (such as in-context learning), and parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime, which we believe closely matches real-world conditions.\n\n\nQuestion 1 and 2\n\nIn current work, there are no such attempts to adapt L-DRO for modalities other than vision and language, however, we believe the principle developed in this work can be easily adapted to other types of data modalities. For Table 4, there is no clear pattern to describe divergences in worst-case accuracy with unaligned semantic relations currently. We do have similar observations that subgroups are (minorly) adversely affected, it serves as fundamentals of combining multiple debiasing sources, specifically, the last two rows."

For instance, [1] achieved 92.9% and 88.3% worst-group accuracy on Waterbirds and CelebA, respectively, which is 10% and 30% higher than L-DRO.

                        "value": "We greatly appreciate your constructive comments. Please see our responses below;\n\nWeakness 1\n\nWe appreciate the insights regarding our method. Projecting all the debiased feature representation onto the null-space of $[T(\\hat{t_{1}}), T(\\hat{t_{2}})]^{T}$ is not the only goal since our solution also encourages the similarity of feature representations before and after the adapter with a consistency loss.\nWithout the consistency loss, we believe all the feature representations may collapse to, e.g., one fixed direction that is perpendicular with $T(\\hat{t_{1}})$ and $T(\\hat{t_{2}})$.\nHowever, with our consistency loss and  $\\eta$ (scalar to balance the above two terms), our results empirically negate the collapse where the average accuracy regarding the task basically does not change compared with zero-shot learning.\n\nWeakness 2\n\nThe works cited ([1]) differ significantly from ours in scope. For work targeting mitigating sub-population shift, there are two categories: a) domain-oblivious in which the membership of each input sample is unknown during training, and b)  domain-aware settings [1].\nOur work targets the setting, domain-oblivious, as well as the selected baselines. However, the mentioned work [1] \u201cre-trains the last linear layer on a small dataset where the backgrounds are not spuriously correlated with the foreground\u201d, which belongs to the second setting, domain-aware.\nThe domain-oblivious, as studied in this paper, is a more challenging setting than domain-aware ones such as [1], since the parameter updating does not have any guidance from the \u201cgood data\u201d. As mentioned in Section 3.2, popular strategies along this line of work usually find oblivious evidence in the loss signal, and the high-level idea can be formulated as distributional robust optimization.\n\nWeakness 3\n\nApologies for any confusion. A quick answer to the misalignment is due to this work only tunes a simple adapter network instead of full model tuning such as JTT and other baselines in the original papers. We mentioned this part in our objective Equation 4 and highlighted the architecture as I\u25b7A\u25b7T in Table 2. To further clarify, we added additional footnotes in Table 2 - only adapter A is tunable. (See the uploaded revised PDF).\nNote that existing works of DRO such as JTT typically tune the whole model while in this work and some large model conditions, parameter-efficient tuning, such as tuning the last two layers only, exhibits popularity.\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\nWe want to clarify that ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization) in Table 2 is exactly the result you look for. As expected, ERM generally does not have satisfying performance over sub-population shifts.\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\nIn Table 4, this work investigates the effect of unaligned debiasing and the combination of multiple debiasing sources. Firstly, the unaligned debiasing does not improve the performance under sub-population shifts. And, the last two rows in Table 4 demonstrate the performance of combining multiple debiasing sources.\n\n\nThank you for pointing out the minor issues, and we have  corrected them. \n\n[1] Zhai R, Dan C, Kolter Z, et al.
