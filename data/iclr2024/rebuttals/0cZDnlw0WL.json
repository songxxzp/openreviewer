However, unlike the discrete case, such condition can be possibly violate when the original data is continuous after being discretized, and it is necessary to discuss that in what condition and in which type of relationship that such invertbility holds.\n- Moreover, based on the work in Miao et al. (2018), it seems that several additional assumptions are also required other than the invertable matrix one, and it is not disclosed and discussed in this work.\n- In fact, instead of discretizing the data, is it possible to directly test the independence using the continuous information?"

The current work attempts to find assumptions such that continuous variables that can be properly discretised such that the proxy causal discovery of previous work can be applied."

It will be useful if some intuition or reasoning is provided.\n- Corollary 4.7: Where are models (a)-(b) defined?\n- Given that the number of bins controls the trade-off between type 1 and type 2 errors, is there a heuristic for choosing this when a user does not have access to the ground truth?\n- What exactly is the difference in Section 4.2 between your work and Warren (2021)? If the variable is unobserved, why does the theory of the previous work not hold in this section?\n- In Section 4.3, what is the difference between your work and Miao et el (2018)? Is it just that you are applying a discretising procedure first?"
