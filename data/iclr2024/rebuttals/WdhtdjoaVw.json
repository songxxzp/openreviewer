                    "value": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are powerful for uncertainty quantification. However, the connection between the parameter space and the function space of NNs is highly nontrivial---it is thus hard to impose an interpretable prior over functions on BNNs. Functional variational BNNs (FVBNNs) can alleviate this issue. However, they are defined through the KL-divergence which leads to some pathologies. The main issue is that the KL-divergence-based variational objective is often ill-defined for FVBNNs since absolute continuity between the variational posterior and the prior is needed. \n\nTo alleviate these issues, the authors propose to \"translate\" functional BNNs problems into parametric ones. First, they match the (arbitrary) functional prior to the same parametric family as the variational posterior (e.g. Gaussians) by minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance, approximated using samples. Then, they use the resulting parametric prior for standard parametric variational inference. These two steps can be collapsed into one, resulting in the Functional Wasserstein Bridge Inference (FWBI) objective.\n\nExperimental results show that FWBI is better than previous KL-based FVBNNs."

                    "value": "There are two main issues from my point of view. I'm happy to increase my score if they are sufficiently addressed.\n\n**Baseline selection** \n\nWhile the experiment setup is good (it encompasses different applications such as regression, bandits, and classification), it ignores non-variational baselines, such as the deep kernel learning (DKL, Wilson et al., 2016) and the Laplace approximation (LA, Daxberger et al., 2021). They are both function-space BNNs---for the latter, it is given by the linearized (Immer et al., 2021) and the last-layer Laplace (Riquelme et al., 2018) formulations. They have been shown to be very scalable (for the last-layer version, even applicable to transformers) and yield good uncertainty quantification performance. Moreover, have also been applied in similar experimental setups as in the present paper (e.g. bandits (see [Sec. 3.2 here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00137.pdf)) or [Bayesian optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08309)). So I think comparing the FWBI with a Laplace baseline is a must, both in terms of performance and costs. The latter is very important since it dictates whether a method is practical or not.\n\nRegarding Tab. 2, the classification performance presented is very bad. I suggest the authors use more standard networks for those problems. E.g. LeNet-5 for MNIST and FMNIST, and ResNet for CIFAR-10. Otherwise, Tab. 2 will only cast FWBI in a bad light.\n\n**Unclear contributions**\n\nThe authors mention that \"prior distillation\"---the first step in FWBI---and \"Wasserstein variational inference\"---the second step of FWBI, have been done separately before. This makes FWBI seem to simply combine two prior things together. Could the authors comment on this?\n\nThe \"Related Work\" section is supposed to address this confusion. However, I find that that section simply describes prior works without discussing the differences between them and the authors' present work. I suggest the authors to rework that section for better clarity."

                        "value": "We express our gratitude to\u202fReviewer kp8E\u202ffor positive and insightful feedback. In response to your comments, we prepared a revised version of the manuscript and address specific questions below.\n\n> Q1: Prop. 1 tells us that the FWBI objective is a lower bound to the standard ELBO. While it is good that FWBI defines a lower bound to the marginal likelihood, I think the result is incomplete. For example, a sufficiently small constant function will also be a valid lower bound, but obviously, it is a bad lower bound. Could you please comment on how good is the FWBI objective?\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We want to firstly explain the role of ELBO here. The reason why we want to have a valid ELBO of the data likelihood is because we can achieve the marginal likelihood maximization via maximizing the valid ELBO. Yes, a sufficiently small constant function could also be a lower bound for marginal likelihood, but we cannot achieve the marginal likelihood maximization via maximizing this \u201csufficiently small constant function\u201d. Maximizing a good lower bound could improve the data marginal likelihood and then improve the predictive performance, so we can use our experimental results to evaluate our FWBI objective.  \n\n> Q2: Still in Prop. 1: Ignoring the obvious flaws presented in Sec. 2, can you comment on why FWBI yields better performance than other (KL-based) FVBNNs even though the KL-ELBO is a tighter lower bound?\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Firstly, the tighter bower is preferred due to the larger possibility of obtaining maximized data likelihood, but it does not guarantee to obtain better performance in practice. One example is Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) [1] which uses KL divergence to replace the Total Variation divergence in practice but, in fact, Total Variation divergence has a tighter bound than KL.  \n\nSecondly, apart from the obvious flaws presented in Section 2, one possible reason is that KL divergence is easily caught in a local minimum, but Wasserstein distance has the better ability to jump out of local minimum. To show that, we add a Figure 17 in Appendix E.10, where we use KL and Wasserstein distances as the loss function to approximate a Gaussian mixture model (with three components) using a (single-mode) Gaussian distribution. We found that 1) KL divergence is sensitive to the initialization. For different initializations, there are two different results (Figures 17(c) and 17(f)) from KL divergence. In contrast, the results from Wasserstein distance (Figures 17(b) and 17(e)) are the same under different initializations; and 2) Wasserstein could jump out of the local optimum and move close to the global optimal mode (which is the up-left corner one with the darkest colour in Figure 17). \n\n[1], https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05477.pdf"

We did use the similar idea with \u201cprior distillation\u201d, but we want to highlight that \u201cprior distillation\u201d is not for functional variational inference. The task of \u201cprior distillation\u201d is the prior matching. The other difference is that the 1-Wasserstein distance to measure the distance between two stochastic processes is only one terms of our algorithm, and we have another two terms: one is log-likelihood and the other is the distance between variational posterior and bridging distribution. The three terms are jointly optimized in a functional variational inference framework which is our main contribution in this study. \u201cWasserstein variational inference\u201d is firstly a parameter-space method but ours is functional space method. Secondly, \u201cWasserstein variational inference\u201d defines the loss function using the Wasserstein distance between variational distribution and prior, but ours is a log-likelihood term plus the Wasserstein distance between variational distribution with bridging distribution. The two forms are not equal with each other because the distance is Wasserstein rather than KL divergence.   \n\nWe would like to thank Reviewer kp8E, and we hope that our changes adequately address your concerns. Please let us know if you have any further questions or comments, and we are very happy to follow up!"

But the key here is how costly and how easy are those methods applied to NNs that are relevant practice. It is fine to have a somewhat expensive method, as long as the tradeoff (in terms of performance) is worth it. For this reason, I asked you to compare with Laplace in different (not toy) setups: Laplace is good and cheap for many tasks like image classification [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14806), LLM language modeling [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13111), contextual bandits [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00137), and Bayesian optimization [[4]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08309)---it can thus serve as a strong baseline against your method, which in turn makes your argument much stronger.\n\nIn any case, I will assign my final score after the closed discussion period between reviewers + AC."

The p-value for any given pair (one is ours and the other is any other method) is <0.001, so we draw the conclusion that our method is significantly better than others. To save the space, we add a sentence in the caption of the table to state that \u201cWe performed the paired-sample t-test for the results from FWBI and the results from other methods and all pairs are with p < .001\u201d instead of including all p-values in the table.  \n\n> Definition of Convergence: Upon reviewing Appendix D.3, I noted that the convergence line appears to be based on the learning objective. Could you please clarify your definition of convergence within this context? Furthermore, is it possible to theoretically prove the algorithm's convergence, given your chosen definition?\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ The convergence figures are the convergence processes of the 1-Wasserstein distance between the bridging distribution over functions and the functional prior (the top row), and the 2-Wasserstein distance between the variational posterior and the bridging distribution (the bottom row) during the training. Additionally, we added convergence plots for the overall variational objective function of FWBI in Figures 9 and 10 of Appendix for two toy examples respectively. The convergence here means the objective function to be converge to some stable values during the optimization. The comparisons of methods are valid only when they are converged well. That is the reason why we plot them here. Note that our algorithm is to design a loss function rather than optimize the loss function. Specially, we have designed a loss function in Eq. (11) for functional BNNs problem, and then we use an optimizer (e.g., SGD or Adam) to optimize this loss function. Given a loss function, the convergence is guaranteed by the optimizer rather than our algorithm.  \n\nWe would again like to thank Reviewer ExHU, and we hope that our changes adequately address your concerns.

In response to your comments, we prepared a revised version of the manuscript and address specific questions below. \n\n> Q1: Figure 1/2 only visualize an FBNN baseline. What would a corresponding figure look like for your main competitor, i.e., GWI?} \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have tested GWI using Figure 1\u2019s setting and the results are given in Figure 6 (a), (b), and (c) of Appendix E.2. We can see that our FWBI still shows stronger predictive ability to recover the target function and competitive uncertainty estimation in the unseen regions. Since Figure 2 is used to show the ability of our method to use non-GP prior, we did not include them because GWI cannot use BNN non-GP priors.  \n\n> Q2: How does the posterior for a GP with each of the three kernels look like for Figure 1/2? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Since we want to highlight that our method (and other functional BNNs) could easily incorporate a meaningful prior via GP contrast to parameter-space BNNs, we give a presumed meaningful GP prior to all functional BNNs in the Figures 1 and 2. To obtain a \u201cmeaningful\u201d GP prior, we used all (both training and test) data points to train a GP. Such setting is unfair to GP. Hence, in Figure 7 of Appendix E.3, we change the prior to a GP trained only on training data points and then the results from GP (with three kernels) and our method are compared, where our method has similar large variances in the regions without data but better (smaller) variance on the regions with observed training data.   \n\n> While the paper already evaluates several priors (RBF, Mat\u00e9rn, linear kernels, and a BNN), it lacks some more interesting ones, e.g., how would a periodic kernel-based prior (as mentioned in the introduction) perform in Figure 2? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have added posterior results for periodic-kernel based GP prior in Figure2, and FWBI still performs well with periodic kernel compared to other methods. \n\n> The contribution section promises \"reliable uncertainty estimation\", while barely providing such an experiment in the form of OOD detection. A more detailed evaluation would involve reporting predictive log-likelihoods for all regressions and classification experiments (in addition to the current RMSE/Accuracy), as well as, e.g., expected classification errors for the classification setup.\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have added the NLL results for UCI regression in Table3 in Appendix E.7. For OOD detection in classification task, there are AUC results based on Entropy of the predictions shown in Table 2 in the main body, and Figure 16 in Appendix E.9 also shows the ROC curve. Our FWBI shows competitive uncertainty estimation performance compared to other methods. We also added the calibration curves of all parametric and functional methods for toy regression examples shown in Figure 8 in Appendix E.4, where our FWBI shows the most superior calibration results. \n\n> For Figures 1/2 the mean fit looks a lot better than for the baselines, but still lacks a lot with respect to predictive uncertainty. Compare this to Figure 1 in Wild et al. (2022) who use the same function.\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ It is possible that the experimental results will not be the same under different settings. We have added the results of Wild et al. (2022) under our settings on the toy example shown in Figure 6 of Appendix E.2, where we can see that our FWBI still shows stronger predictive ability to recover the target function and competitive uncertainty estimation in the unseen regions. \n\n> Sec 2, second paragraph claims \"if prior and likelihood distributions are both assumed to be Gaussian, the posterior can be solved analytically as a Gaussian. As the posterior for neural-network-based mappings within the likelihood is highly multimodal, this is a false statement.\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Sorry for the misunderstanding. In fact, our statement was intended for the general Bayesian inference not for BNNs, and we have removed this sentence in the revision to avoid the misunderstanding. \n\n> Similarly, on page 3 (top) it is stated that parameter-space variational objectives can be optimized if the variational posterior \"is assumed to be a fully-factorized Gaussian distribution\".

To achieve this, the authors build a bridge process and propose to use 1-Wasserstein distance between random processes to minimize the distance between the bridge process and an apriori random process that provides a suitable prior over the functions (e.g. Gaussian Process). Then in the second step, the variational posterior over the network weights is optimized to match the bridging distribution in the parameter space where the optimization is done by minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between the parametric variational family and the bridging distribution. In order to avoid constraining the solution space of the bridging distribution, the authors propose to perform the first and second optimization simultaneously, and provide efficient sample-based algorithms to minimize the weighted sum of the 1-Wasserstein functional distance and 2-Wasserstein parameter distance. Experiments are done on toy datasets, contextual bandits, the UCI dataset, and image classification. In all cases, the proposed method (FWBI) outperforms compared methods in terms of accuracy. The OOD detection results are presented on the image classification dataset where FWBI shows better performance than the compared methods on two out of three datasets."

                    "value": "Despite their promise and excellent motivation, BDL methods have rarely been used in applied settings. This is due to a multitude of reasons. First, performing exact inference in the parameter space is intractable, leading to a handful of approximate inference techniques developed to remedy this. Second, incorporating prior knowledge about the problem space or task space in the parameter space is challenging due to a lack of clear understanding of how parameter priors translate into functional priors. This has motivated the development of building priors directly in the function space but most of the existing methods are not general enough for a wide range of applications or suffer from intractability of inference in high dimensions. This paper proposes an alternative framework based on Wasserstein bridges that remedies the existing issues and appears to possess strong prediction and calibration properties.\n\nThe paper is self-contained and the presentation of arguments follows a logical order.\n\nIncluding both quantitative and qualitative results on multiple datasets is an important strength of the paper."

In response to your comments, we prepared a revised version of the manuscript and address specific questions below. \n\n> Q1: Parts of the presented methods are very similar to [1]. Please include a more detailed discussion of what exactly are the differences and how the methods compare in terms of their performance. \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Firstly, we want to highlight that [1] is not for functional variational inference. The task of [1] is the prior matching. The different tasks are the first major difference between ours with [1], and that is the reason why we did not include it as comparative method. The other difference is that the 1-Wasserstein distance to measure the distance between two stochastic processes is only one terms of our algorithm, and we have another two terms: one is log-likelihood and the other is the distance between variational posterior and bridging distribution. The three terms are jointly optimized in a functional variational inference framework which is our main contribution in this study.  \n\n> Q2:  Can the authors include these results to show that the model class proposed here achieves better calibration? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have added the NLL results for UCI regression in Table3 in Appendix E.7. For OOD detection in classification task, there are AUC results based on Entropy of the predictions shown in Table 2 in the main body, and Figure 16 in Appendix E.9 also shows the ROC curve. Our FWBI shows competitive uncertainty estimation performance compared to other methods. We also added the calibration curves of all parametric and functional methods for toy regression examples shown in Figure 8 in Appendix E.4, where our FWBI shows the most superior calibration results. \n\n> Q3: In Fig. 2, why does the model provide such narrow uncertainty bounds for regions without data? This is a behavior that\u2019s not expected from a well-calibrated model such as GP with RBF kernel. \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ The reason why our method looks like producing over-confident predictions is because we used a \u201cmeaningful\u201d GP as prior. Since we want to highlight that our method (and other functional BNNs) could easily incorporate a meaningful prior via GP contrast to parameter-space BNNs, we give a presumed meaningful GP prior to all functional BNNs in the Figures 1 and 2. To obtain a \u201cmeaningful\u201d GP prior, we used all (both training and test) data points to train a GP. Such prior gives FBNNs stronger predictive capabilities in the area even without training data, which makes our method look like over-confident. In Figure 7 of Appendix E.3, we change the prior to a GP trained only on training data points, and then our method would not look like over-confident any more as demonstrated by the large variances in the areas without training data.  \n\n> Q4: I\u2019m not quite sure how to interpret the results presented in Figs. 1, 2. Do the error bars represent standard deviation? If so, to me a method that does a reasonable job of calibration should have error bars that cover the true function. This seems to be the case only for the KLBBB method. How do the authors justify these results? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Yes, you are right that the error bars represent the standard deviation. Note that the error bars from a reasonable method should cover the true function only in the regions with training data. For the regions without training data, there is no guarantee for the coverage. The best method should be able to cover the true function in the regions with training data with small standard deviation and show relatively larger standard deviation in the regions without training data.   \n\n> Q5: Can the authors include GP as the gold standard for the comparisons in FIg. 1, 2? Also, can you include an MCMC method such as HMC performed on BNN with normal weights (use a small BNN so that HMC can run in a reasonable amount of time, or use SG-MCMC for intermediate BNNs) in compared methods?\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ The figure 2 is used to show the ability of our method to use non-GP prior, so we only added SG-MCMC results using Figure 1\u2019s setting and the results are shown in Figure 6(d) of Appendix. Since we used a meaningful GP prior for our method in Figure 1, the setting would be unfair for GP. Hence, we also compare GP with our methods in In Figure 7 of Appendix E.3, we change the prior to a GP trained only on training data points, and then our method would not look like over-confident any more as demonstrated by the large variances in the areas without training data."

Consider a 1-D periodic function: $y = 2 * \\sin(4x) + \\epsilon$ with noise $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,0.01)$, and randomly sample 20 training points from this function within $[-2, -0.5] \\cup[0.5, 2]$. Firstly, we fit a GP with Matern kernel as the prior using these training data. Since the Matern kernel has a parameter $\\nu$ used to control the smoothness of the functions from GP, we use $\\nu$ to simulate different prior smoothness. The results are shown in Figure 12 of Appendix E.6, where Figures 12(a) and 12(b) are the results from the unsmoothed ($\\nu=0.5$) and smoothed ($\\nu=2.5$) GP priors, respectively. The corresponding FWBI posteriors are shown in Figures 12(c) and 12(d), where we can see the smoothness of prior has very limited effects on the resulting posteriors. \n\nThen, we investigate the impact of prior noise on the posteriors by adding different GP noises to the pre-trained GP prior (with periodic kernel). Specifically, we consider two situations: GP noises with fixed 0 mean and varying variances, and GP noises with fixed variance and varying means, respectively. The results are shown in Figures 13 and 14 of Appendix E.6, where the left column shows several GP priors with different injected noises, and the right column shows the corresponding FWBI posteriors. We can observe that: 1) when the mean of noises is fixed, there is no significant effect from varying variances (from 0.5 to 5) on the region with training data, and only a minor effect on the right-hand side region without observed training data. The larger variances tend to destroy the prediction on the non-data regions; 2) when the variance of noises is fixed, varying means (from 0.3 to 3) also have little effect on the region with training data but destroy the prediction on the non-data regions. The larger changed means would lead to worse prediction.   \n\nWe would again like to thank Reviewer b5oj, and we hope that our changes adequately address your concerns. Please let us know if you have any further questions or comments, and we are very happy to follow up!"

They uses the bi-Lipschitz condition to make the hidden mapping distance preserving and further improve the uncertainty quality of a single DNN. Specifically, the upper Lipschitz bound prevents the hidden representations from overly sensitive to the meaningfulness perturbations, and the lower Lipschitz bound prevents the hidden representation from collapsing the representations of distinct examples together. While our work is motivated by different perspectives, in which the Lipschitz function is used only for the estimation of the 1-Wasserstein distance between the functional prior and the bridging distribution."

Typical function-space VI approaches define the similarity between distributions over functions in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence, but this measure is known to be ill-defined for such distributions. As an alternative similarity measure, the authors propose to use the Wasserstein distance between the variational posterior and the (parametric) prior, which itself is fitted to a functional prior (e.g., a Gaussian process) by minimising another Wasserstein distance. The resulting objective contains the likelihood and the two Wasserstein distances, but the authors show (in the appendix) that this is a proper lower bound on the model evidence. Finally, they compare FWBI against both weight-space and function-space inference approaches, showing good predictive performance and uncertainty quantification."

The authors do not discuss how to choose or tune these hyperparameters.\n3. The experiments use the functional BNNs of Sun et al.

                        "value": "We express our gratitude to\u202fReviewer RTAX\u202ffor the support. In response to your comments, we prepared a revised version of the manuscript and address specific questions below. **\n\n> Q1: In section 3.2, you call  $\\theta_q$ and  $\\theta_q$ \"stochastic parameters\". It also seems like they are sampled in Eq. (12), but in Eq. (11), they are minimised, which confuses me. Can you elaborate on this?\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Sorry for the confusion! $\\theta_q$ is the stochastic variational parameter of the optimization problem in Eq. (11). Once the optimal $\\theta_q^*: =(\\mathbf{\\mu}_q^*, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_q^*)$ is obtained, we can obtain the approximation posterior predictive function draws by sampling weights $\\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ from $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{\\mu}_q^*, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_q^*)$. We have revised the Eq. (12) as follow: \n\n$q(\\mathbf{y}^*|\\mathbf{x}^*) \\approx \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{j=1}^{S} p(\\mathbf{y}^*|f(\\mathbf{x}^*; \\mathbf{w}^{(j)})), \\mathbf{w}^{(j)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{\\mu}_q^*, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_q^*), \\boldsymbol{\\theta_q}^* := (\\mathbf{\\mu}_q^*, \\mathbf{\\Sigma}_q^*).$\n\n> Q2: Did you compute uncertainty quantification metrics, such as the predictive log-likelihood, for the UCI experiments? Based on figures 1 and 2, it seems to me that FWBI produces quite over-confident predictions. \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have added the NLL results for UCI regression in Table3 in Appendix E.7. Our FWBI shows competitive uncertainty estimation performance compared to other methods. Furthermore, we also added the calibration curves as recommended by a reviewer and the results are shown in Figure 3 in Appendix E.4, where our methods have shown better performances as well.   \n\nThe reason why our method looks like producing over-confident predictions is because we used a \u201cmeaningful\u201d GP as prior. Since we want to highlight that our method (and other functional BNNs) could easily incorporate a meaningful prior via GP contrast to parameter-space BNNs, we give a presumed meaningful GP prior to all functional BNNs in the Figures 1 and 2. To obtain a \u201cmeaningful\u201d GP prior, we used all (both training and test) data points to train a GP. Such prior gives FBNNs stronger predictive capabilities in the area even without training data, which makes our method look like over-confident. In Figure 7 of Appendix E.3, we change the prior to a GP trained only on training data points, and then our method would not look like over-confident any more as demonstrated by the large variances in the areas without training data.  \n\n> Q3: Do you have advice on how to select or tune the hyperparameters in the objective? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We did not use any hyperparameter tuning method to obtain the optimal ones but only chose the hyperparameters to ensure different components are within the same scale. We believe our method could achieve further better performance after thorough hyperparameter tuning using some black-box optimization methods, like Optuna and scikit-optimize.   \n\n> Q4: What does the running time in E.2 measure? Is it training time or prediction time? If training time, is it per epoch or until convergence? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ The running time in E.2 is the total training time for all 2000 training epochs. \n\n> I am mainly missing some empirical analysis of the proposed objective compared to competitors. The running time is faster, but how does, say, the stability of the training or the convergence speed compare to other methods? \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We have added a plot of convergence processes of training loss for our FWBI in Figures 9 and 10 in Appendix E.5 on toy examples and convergence processes for all methods in Figure 15 in Appendix E.8 on UCI regressions. Our FWBI demonstrates better convergence speed and stability compared to other methods. \n\n> The experiments use the functional BNNs of Sun et al. (2019) as the main competitor, but more recent and stronger baselines exist, for instance, Ma and Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato (2021) and Rudner et al. (2022), which are both cited by the authors. It would have been fair to at least include one such baseline in the experimental evaluation.\n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ We did try to include them as our competitive methods. However, they did not publish their codes, and we tried to ask for the code from the authors by email, but unfortunately, didn't get any reply. \n\n> Given that this proof is highlighted as a contribution, at least something should be said about it in the main paper. \n\n$\\textbf{Reply:}$ Thanks for the suggestion! We did move a lot of content to the Appendix due to the page limitation. As recommended by the reviewer, we move the statement of the theorem to the main body but have to still leave the proof details in Appendix. \n\nWe would again like to thank Reviewer RTAX, and we hope that our changes adequately address your concerns. Please let us know if you have any further questions or comments, and we are very happy to follow up!"
