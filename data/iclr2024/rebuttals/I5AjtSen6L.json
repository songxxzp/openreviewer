                    "value": "The paper aims to certify the fairness of GNN models. The authors specify an indicator function that returns 1 when a given fairness metric (e.g. SP or EO) is below a treshold. This essentially reduces the problem to certifying a generic binary function, a problem that can be tackled with existing randomized smoothing certificates. They adopt the randomized smoothing framework and consider perturbations w.r.t. both the node attributes ($l_2$ norm) and the graph structure ($l_0$ norm) using Gaussian and Bernoulli noise respectively."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "One of the biggest weaknesses of the paper is that it does not properly place its results in the context of the existing literature. Once the indicator function w.r.t. the threshold has been defined the problem of certifying the output of the resulting function $g$ is a trivial application of previous results. The result from Theorem 1 has been know since 2019, since Theorem 1 (specifically Eq. 3) in [1] directly applies. However, the authors spend considerable effort re-proving these known results (e.g. via the intermediate Lemmas A1, A2 and A3 which are also known). Similarly, the results from Theorem 2 and Theorem 3 are already known, see [2] and the generalization in [3].\n\nThe paper also ignores the existence of collective certificates (see e.g. [4] and follow up work). Since for such collective certificates the predictions of all nodes are simultaneously certified this automatically implies a certificate on any function of those predictions and in particular any fairness metric. Therefore, a comparison with collective certificates is warranted. \n\nAs a minor point: While the authors are the first to consider certficates w.r.t. both features and structure when the features are continious, joint certificates for discrete features have already been studuied in [3]. Moreover, the certificate in [3] is provably tight, while there is no such proof for the joint certificate presented in this paper. In addition, the presented joint certificate depends on the order: whether the features or the structure is certified first. Since the examined datatset can easily be modeled with discrete features (or at least approximated with a large number of categories) a reasonable baseline would be to use the joint certificate from [3] -- now applied to certify the function $g$ rather than the underlying classifier.\n\nAs a minor point: The authors claim that there is a high computational cost of calculating $\\epsilon_A$. While the cost is higher compared to Gaussian smoothing it is definitely not prohibitevely high since as shown by [3] the certificate can be computed in linear time w.r.t. the certified radius, and thus the maximum certified redius can be also efficiently computed.\n\nIn addition to the above I have strong doubts in the correctness of Proposition 1 and the discussion in the preceeding \"Obtaining Fair Classification Result\" paragraph. Namely, the only thing that the randomized smoothing certificate asserts is that the output of the smoothed $g$ is the same for an observed input and any perturbation withing the certified radius. However, it does not imply that any particular $n$ dimensional output (for each of the $n$ test nodes) is certified. This is the same reason why we cannot simply certify a function $h = I$(accuracy of all nodes > threshold) and we need dedicated collective certificates as in [3] which certifies the collective prediction of all nodes. I'm happy to be proven wrong and reconsider if the authors provide a more in depth explanation. Note, that it is also not valid to consider the average vector of predictions. This also highlihts another big weakness -- certifying g is informative but any particular vector of predictions (for each test node) is not cerified, so in practice it's not clear which prediction the model should return.\n\nMoreover, it seems that the guarantee in Proposition 1 only applies to perturbations w.r.t. the features since the authors take the best (smallest) value over all structure perturbation. If this is the case this should be clearly mentioned, if this is not the case it is not clear at all why the certificate holds when selecting the argmin as proposed.\n\nAnother weakness is the evaluation. While the 3 datasets (German Credit, Recidivism, Credit Defaulter) are often used in the fairness literature they are not ideal since the graph structure is not given but derived from the features (see NIFTY (Agarwal et al., 2021)). This means that there is a high correlation between the features and the structure and the redunancy in information leads to overly optimistic results. The two Pokec datasets which are also often used in the fairness literature would be more suitable.\n\nSince every entry is flipped with the same probability $1-\\beta$ even for very small values of $1-\\beta$ we will introduced many new ones in the adjacency matrix destroying the sparsity which makes scaling to larger graphs more difficult.\n\nFinally, I think the motivation behind the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) metric is questionable. A more informative metric would be e.g. the largest certified threshold $\\eta$ for different bugets.\n\nReferences:\n1. Cohen et al. \"Certified adversarial robustness via randomized smoothing\"\n2.

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate the time and efforts you've dedicated to reviewing and providing invaluable feedback to enhance the quality of this paper. We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.\n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: The paper ignores the existence of collective certificates (see e.g. [4] and follow up work). Since for such collective certificates the predictions of all nodes are simultaneously certified this automatically implies a certificate on any function of those predictions and in particular any fairness metric. Therefore, a comparison with collective certificates is warranted.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We note that to the best of our knowledge, there is **no existing work** where a joint certification for GNNs can be achieved over both continuous node attributes and discrete graph topology. In fact, the problem studied in this paper is novel, and there is neither any straightforward certification approach that can be directly adopted to handle the problem studied in this paper. We are not sure which existing literature the reviewer is referring to by [4] since no corresponding reference is provided. However, we are eager to engage in further discussion to learn about whether the concern has been addressed by the discussion above and how we are still expected to extend any existing approach to serve as baselines. We thank the reviewer again for the key suggestions.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: As a minor point: While the authors are the first to consider certficates w.r.t. both features and structure when the features are continious, joint certificates for discrete features have already been studuied in [3]. \n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. However, we note that **(1) the randomized smoothing technique adopted in [3] is different from the proposed randomized smoothing approach on the graph topology in our paper** and **(2) the techniques in [3] tackle a different problem** from our paper. We elaborate on more details below.  \n\n**The techniques in [3] are different from our paper.** Although both randomized smoothing approaches are able to handle binary data, we note that the randomized smoothing approach proposed in [3] is *data-dependent*. However, the proposed randomized smoothing approach in our paper is *data-independent*. We note that in practice, a data-independent approach enables practitioners to pre-generate noises, which significantly improves usability.\n\n**The studied problem in [3] is different from our paper.** Although the authors claimed to achieve a joint certificate for graph topology and node attributes in [3], all node attributes are assumed to be binary, which can only be applied to cases where these attributes are constructed as bag-of-words representations (as mentioned in the second last paragraph in the Introduction of [3]). However, in our work, we follow a more realistic setting where only graph topology is assumed to be binary while node attributes are considered as continuous. This makes the problem **more difficult to handle**, since different strategies should be adopted for different data modalities. In summary, compared with [3], the problem studied in this paper is more realistic and more suitable for GNNs.  \n\nBased on the discussion above, we believe the contribution of this paper is novel and particularly interesting to the researchers working in this area. We have also added a detailed discussion about the works pointed out by the reviewer in Appendix C.6. We thank the reviewer again for the suggestion.\n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: As a minor point: The authors claim that there is a high computational cost of calculating $\\epsilon_{\\textbf{A}}$. While the cost is higher compared to Gaussian smoothing it is definitely not prohibitively high since as shown by [3] the certificate can be computed in linear time w.r.t. the certified radius, and thus the maximum certified radius can be also efficiently computed.\n\n**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that the computational cost of calculating $\\epsilon_{\\textbf{A}}$ is not prohibitively high. **We need to clarify a misunderstanding below**.   \n\nIn our paper, by claiming that the computational cost of calculating $\\epsilon_{\\textbf{A}}$ is high (as in Appendix B.6), we only aim to claim the computational cost of calculating $\\epsilon_{\\textbf{A}}$ is **higher than that of Gaussian smoothing**, instead of claiming it to be prohibitively high. By this claim, we revealed the reason why we adopt certification on node attributes as the inner certification: since the certified radius of the inner certification needs to be computed more times than the outer certification in our proposed method, it is reasonable to utilize the one with a lower computational cost for the certified radius as the inner certification."

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding that Proposition 1 only holds when the output prediction corresponding to each specific node is certified separately. We note that **Proposition 1 does not rely on certification over any specific prediction**, and this is achieved by formulating a classifier on top of an optimized GNN model (as in Definition 3).  \n\nSpecifically, in traditional works focusing on certification, most existing works simply certify an existing deep learning model by certifying a specific predicted label over a given data point. Here, the prediction results to be certified are classification results. Correspondingly, these works are able to directly certify the model itself. However, the strategy above is not feasible in our studied problem. This is because we seek to certify the level of fairness of a group of nodes. The value of such a group-level property cannot be directly considered as a classification result, and thus they are not feasible to be directly certified. Therefore, we proposed to first formulate a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. As such, achieving certification becomes feasible without certifying any specific classification result of the GNN model.  \n\nIn fact, we note that one of the major differences between our work and other existing works on certification is that most existing works aim to achieve certification over a specific prediction, while our work aims to achieve certification over the property (i.e., the level of fairness) of a set of predictions.

We agree with the reviewer that the graph structure derived from node features may lead to a high correlation between the features and the structure. However, such correlation could also happen in various real-world attributed graph datasets, and **such correlation does not influence the effectiveness of the proposed method**.  \n\nTo further validate the performance of the proposed method, as suggested, we also perform experiments with the same commonly used popular GNN backbone models (as Section 4.2) on the suggested two Pokec datasets, namely Pokec-z and Pokec-n. We present the experimental results below, where all numerical numbers are in percentage. We observe that (1) the GNNs equipped with ELEGANT achieve comparable node classification accuracy; (2) the GNNs equipped with ELEGANT achieve consistently lower levels of bias; and (3) the values of the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) for all GNNs equipped with ELEGANT exceed 90%, exhibiting satisfying usability.

Therefore, we argue that the effectiveness of the proposed approach is not determined by the dataset and is well generalizable over different graph datasets.  \n\nWe thank the reviewer again for bringing this up so we can make our evaluation more comprehensive.

However, we note that **the proposed approach can be easily extended to the batch training case**, which has been widely adopted by existing scalable GNNs. Specifically, a commonly adopted batch training strategy of scalable GNNs is to only input a node and its surrounding subgraph into the GNN, since the prediction of GNNs only depends on the information of the node itself and its multi-hop neighbors, and the number of hops is determined by the layer number of GNNs. Since the approach proposed in our paper aligns with the basic pipeline of GNNs, the perturbation can also be performed for each specific batch of nodes. In this case, all theoretical analyses in this paper still hold, since they also do not rely on the assumption of non-batch training. **Therefore, we would like to argue that the proposed approach can be easily scaled to large graphs.**  We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have added the corresponding discussion in Appendix C.8."

A more informative metric would be e.g. the largest certified threshold $\\eta$ for different bugets.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. We note that the reason for adopting the Fairness Certification Rate (FCR) as the corresponding metric is that such a metric serves as a close extension of the metric of certified accuracy, which has been widely adopted in existing certified defense literature [1, 2]. The corresponding intuition is to measure the ratio of outputs that are both (1) true and (2) successfully certified. **Hence, we argue that adopting FCR maintains the evaluation consistency between this work and other existing works.**  \n\nIn addition, we agree with the reviewer that the largest certified threshold $\\eta$ for different budgets would also be a meaningful metric. Nevertheless, for any given budget, the corresponding smoothed classifier $\\tilde{g}_{\\textbf{A},\\textbf{X}}$ is intractable. As a result, in our studied problem, it is computationally impractical to compute the corresponding $\\eta$  in practice.  \n\n[1] Cohen, J., Rosenfeld, E., & Kolter, Z. (2019, May).

In our understanding, this question is about a modification of the proposed method: if we only apply randomized smoothing to node attributes and only achieve certification over node attributes, then how to obtain the corresponding output with fairness certification on node attributes?\n\nWe note that our method naturally extends to the case mentioned above. Specifically, by setting $\\beta = 1.0$ (i.e., no noise is added to the graph topology), Theorem 1 and Lemma 1 remain hold, since the value of $\\beta$ falls in the assumption of $0.5 < \\beta \\leq 1.0$ (when $\\beta = 1.0$ , the $\\epsilon_{\\textbf{A}}$ in Lemma 1 will then be 0). Correspondingly, the size of the set of $\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{\\textbf{X}}$ presented in Theorem 4 will be one, where such a value is directly computed from Theorem 1. Accordingly, only one output will be involved in the set of $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ , and such output will be returned as the final output. In this process, since the assumption over $\\beta$ still holds, all theoretical analysis also remains hold. According to Theorem 1 and Lemma 1, we have that the fairness certification corresponding to such an output is certified. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, and we have also revised the discussion in Section 3.3 to avoid potential misunderstanding.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: Does Proposition 1 apply to both feature and structure perturbations?\n\n**Authors**: Yes. We note that **Proposition 1 holds for the joint certification over node attributes and graph topology**. We provide detailed proof in Appendix A.8.

We elaborated on their differences below.  \n\n**Difference between Theorem 1 and Existing Results**: The mentioned reference [1] presents the most similar theoretical results compared with Theorem 1. However, the certification achieved in the mentioned reference [1] is directly achieved over the classification model itself, while the certification achieved by Theorems 1 is over a constructed classifier. We argue that such an extension is not obvious. Therefore, comprehensive theoretical analysis is performed in our paper. \n\n**Difference between Theorems 2 and 3 and Existing Results**: We note that Theorems 2 and 3 are established over the joint certification for (continuous) node attributes and (discrete) graph topology. To the best of our knowledge, there is **no existing work** where a joint certification for GNNs can be achieved over both continuous node attributes and discrete graph topology (also see the 1st reply above). In fact, the problem studied in this paper is novel, and there is neither any straightforward certification approach that can be directly adopted to handle the problem studied in this paper.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: How does the approach compare to collective certificate (w.r.t. only structure perturbations for example)?\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the question. We note that compared with existing works on collective certification (especially those only focused on the binary perturbations suitable for graph structures, e.g., [1]), our paper (1) **utilizes a different randomized smoothing technique** and (2) **first achieves joint certification over the continuous and discrete span of the two input data modalities**. Specifically, we take the comparison between [1] and our paper as an example. First, although both the approach proposed by our paper and that in [1] are able to handle binary data, we note that the randomized smoothing approach proposed in [1] is *data-dependent*. However, the proposed randomized smoothing approach in our paper is *data-independent*. We note that in practice, a data-independent approach enables practitioners to pre-generate noises, which significantly improves usability. Second, although the authors claimed to achieve a joint certificate for graph topology and node attributes in [1], all node attributes are assumed to be binary, which can only be applied to cases where these attributes are constructed as bag-of-words representations (as mentioned in the second last paragraph in the Introduction of [1]). However, in our work, we follow a more realistic setting where only graph topology is assumed to be binary while node attributes are considered continuous. This makes the problem more difficult to handle since different strategies should be adopted for different data modalities.   \n\nIn summary, compared with [1], the problem studied in this paper is more realistic and more suitable for GNNs, and such a problem is tackled with a different technical approach. We have also added a detailed discussion about the works pointed out by the reviewer in Appendix C.6. We thank the reviewer again for the suggestion.\n\n[1] Bojchevski, A., Gasteiger, J., & G\u00fcnnemann, S. (2020, November).

I still have a few unresolved questions.\n\nBy collective certificate I was refering to certificates such as [4] and [5] that jointly certify multiple nodes at once. Collective does not refer to structure + attribute. Appologies for the missing reference [4] in my original review. My question \"How does the approach compare to collective certificate (w.r.t. only structure perturbations for example)?\" still stands.\n\nI understand that Proposition 1 does not rely on certification over any specific prediction. This is preceisly the issue that I have. As you say, essentially you certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. However, at the end of the day, when the model is deployed, you need to make and commit to some actual predictions for each node. These predictions will have some level of fairness. Whatever this level of fairness is for these \"final\" predictions it is not the same level which is certified by Proposition 1. If you agree, this is a major weakness. If you disagree please clearly specify what are the actual final predictins, and whether they have a certified fairness level or not, and if they do how exactly does this follow from Propostion 1.\n\nAs another point: [1] introduce both a binary and a discrete certificate and the joint (attribute + structure) can be binary+binary or discrete+binary (discrete for features + binary for structure). You can discreteize any continious data to arbitrary precision. Moreover, an $l_0$ certificate implies a corresponding $l_2$ ceritificate by the properties of norms so it can be directly compared to your apporach.\n\nFinally, I thinik the benefit of data-dependent noise heavily outweighs any benefit that data-independent approach enables. Pre-generating noises is only slighlty helpful since it is extremely cheap to sample binary vectors.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n4. \"Collective Robustness Certificates: Exploiting Interdependence in Graph Neural Networks\" by Schuchardt et. al\n\n5. \"Localized Randomized Smoothing for Collective Robustness Certification\" by Schuchardt et. al"

This much is clear. \n\nHowever, this certificate only says that the **smoothed** bias function as defined in Eq. 1 has the same output in the worst case.

                        "value": "Thanks for your valuable feedback. We would like to clarify your last concern below.  \n\nFirst, we assume that we are given a reasonable $\\eta$ as the threshold of the output bias level to be certified, where the bias level of the output of the GNN model should be less or equal to $\\eta$. In other words, the output of the bias indicator function (defined in Def. 1) should be 1 before the randomized smoothing.  \n\nThen, given the mentioned situation, we are able to certify the output of the smoothed bias function (defined in Def. 2) has the same output (i.e., having an output of 1) in the worst case. Note that the output of the smoothed bias function is directly calculated from the output of the GNN model. Consider the bias level of the output predictions associated with the smoothed bias function being 1 under the random noise as a random variable. Then the probability of such a random variable being less or equal to $\\eta$ should be larger than 0.5 according to the definition of the smoothed bias function in Def 2.  \n\nThe last step is to obtain the predictions for the test nodes. Since we have known that under the input noise, the output predictions of GNN will have a probability of at least 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\\eta$. Denote we have a prediction sample set $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as in Proposition 1) obtained from the Monte Carlo sampling, where each element in this set includes the output predictions for all test nodes. We then know each element in $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ will have at least a probability of 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\\eta$. Finally, we choose the least biased element in  $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as the predictions for the test nodes), the chosen element will bear a probability that is small enough to be still more biased than $\\eta$ (as stated in Proposition 1). This completes the certification in practice.  \n\nWe believe this addresses your last concern, and we hope that you could also consider raising your score. We thank you again for your constructive feedback and deep understanding of our paper."

Any particular sample from this random variable is either above or below the threshold so what do you mean by \"output predictions of GNN will have a probability of at least 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold\"?\n\nTo put it in other words, if you draw 100 samples from the variable, some of these will be $< \\eta$, others will be $> \\eta$ and Theorem 1 says that the average of these 100 must be $> 0.5$. Now if you take out of 100 samples the one that is the most fair, this one might be $< \\eta$ or $> \\eta$ but there is no way to know.  Is there any flaw with this logic?"

                        "value": "Thanks for the prompt feedback.  \n\nWe would like to clarify a misunderstanding below, and we follow the example of drawing 100 samples. Theorem 1 certifies that **every time we draw a sample, it will bear a probability of larger than 0.5 to have a bias level smaller than $\\eta$**. Therefore, the smoothed bias indicator function (in Eq. 1) can be certified to output 1, as this function returns **what most likely to happen**.  \n\nGiven the context above, if we choose the least biased sample from the 100 samples, it bears a probability of at most $0.5^{100}$ to be still more biased than $\\eta$. Since this requires all 100 samples to be more biased than $\\eta$, which has a small enough probability to happen.\n\nIt seems that the misunderstanding is associated with Theorem 1. To put it simply, Theorem 1 says that the random variable (i.e., the bias level of predictions) will always have a larger probability of being less biased than $\\eta$. **We do not calculate or achieve certification over the mean of the bias level in this process.**\n\nWe hope this addresses your last concern."

Once you have a sample there is no other random process on top whose outcome is $>0.5$. Or am I missing something?\n\nMaybe we can approach my question from another angle. Think about an input graph $G=(A, X)$, now think about the infinitely many potential samples of the graph $[G(A, X+\\epsilon_1), G(A, X+\\epsilon_2), G(A, X+\\epsilon_3), \\dots]$ where each $\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. As you take each of these infinite samples and put them into a GNN the output is deterministic, either it's $<\\eta$ or not. We can record this event as 1 or 0. So we have inifnitely many 1s and 0s indicating the event of whether we are below or above $\\eta$. The average of these events is precisely defintion 2, and the average is guaranteed to be $>0.5$ for $X$ and any perturbed $X'$ in the radius. \n\nSo if each of these individual infinitely many samples is deterministic, I don't understand what you mean by \"it will bear a probability of larger than 0.5\"."

In other words, Theorem 1 guarantees that 1 will have a larger probability of appearing than 0.

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate the efforts you've dedicated to reviewing and providing invaluable feedback to enhance the quality of this paper. We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.\n\n---\n>  **Reviewer**: How can one utilize ELEGANT for fairness certification for a fairness metric requiring the ground-truth labels (like equal opportunity)? I could not follow how the proposed scheme can be used to certify fairness metrics requiring the ground-truth label information (e.g., equal opportunity) over the test set. The paper claims that equal opportunity is a metric for which they can provide verification.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that the proposed model is more suitable for achieving certification over the metrics that do not require ground-truth labels. However, for metrics that require ground-truth labels, we are able to utilize a surrogate model (here we utilize GCN) to obtain predicted labels for the test nodes. We agree with the reviewer that the discussion associated with this part could be improved for better clarification. We have revised Section 4.3 accordingly, and we thank the reviewer again for the constructive feedback.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: There are already existing works searching over such augmentations for bias mitigation [1, 2, 3], which utilize theoretical findings and systematic designs to automatize augmentation designs. Thus, the bias mitigation part of this work is not of sufficient contribution (Figure 2 would be fairer, if fairness-aware methods' results are obtained over the same set of corrupted graphs used for ELEGANT).\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We note that improving fairness is a byproduct of ELEGANT, and our main focus is to achieve certification over the fairness level of the GNN prediction results.  Specifically, we emphasize that the main contribution of this paper lies in establishing an approach for the joint certification over the span of both continuous and discrete input graph data. To the best of our knowledge, this serves as the first work that (1) achieves certified defense for the fairness of GNNs and (2) achieves joint certification against attacks on both node attributes and graph topology.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: While the initial research problem is an interesting and important one, to the best of my understanding, this paper applies well-known corruptions to the input graphs multiple times and utilizes Monte Carlo to estimate if the predictions achieve a certain level of fairness. The proposed approach is computationally costly, and lacks an inventive approach.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. We provide the clarification of the (1) time complexity analysis and (2) the novelty of the proposed approach below.  \n\n**(1) Time complexity analysis.**  \n\n*Theoretical*: The time complexity is theoretically linear w.r.t. the total number of the random perturbations $N$, i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. In our experiments, we perform 30,000 random perturbations over the span of node attributes and graph structure. We note that the running time is always acceptable even if $N$ is large, since the certification process does not require GNN re-training (which is the most costly procedure throughout this process). In addition, all runnings based on these random perturbations do not rely on the prediction results from each other. Hence they can be paralleled altogether theoretically, which will further reduce the running time.  \n\n*Experimental*: We also perform a study of running time. Specifically, we compare the running time of a successful certification under 30,000 random noise samples and a regular training-inference cycle with vanilla GCN in Appendix B.8. We observe that (1) although ELEGANT improves the computational cost compared with the vanilla GNN backbones, the running time remains acceptable; and (2) ELEGANT has less running time growth rate on larger datasets. For example, E-SAGE has around 10x running time on German Credit (a smaller dataset) while only around 4x on Credit Default (a larger dataset) compared to vanilla SAGE. Hence we argue that ELEGANT bears a high level of usability in terms of complexity and running time.  \n\n**(2) The novelty of the proposed approach.**  \n\nWe argue that utilizing the commonly adopted noise to achieve randomized smoothing does not jeopardize the novelty of this paper, since the novelty of this paper does not lie in the selection of noise. Instead, this paper established an approach for the joint certification over the span of both continuous and discrete input data, which particularly fits the need of Graph Neural Networks. In fact, this serves as the first work that (1) achieves certified defense for the fairness of GNNs and (2) achieves joint certification against attacks on both node attributes and graph topology to the best of our knowledge."

The framework, called ELEGANT, aims to protect the GNNs from malicious attacks that can corrupt the fairness of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. The framework uses a theoretical analysis to certify that the GNNs are robust to certain perturbation budgets, such that the attackers cannot degrade the fairness level within those budgets. The framework can be applied to any existing GNN model without re-training or making any assumptions. The paper evaluates the framework on real-world datasets and shows that it achieves effective and efficient certification, as well as debiasing benefits."

We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.\n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: 1) Why the authors choose to certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN is unclear, given the existing works on robustness certification of GNNs on regular attacks mainly choose to directly target GNNs.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We present the reason to *certify a classifier on top of an optimized GNN* instead of *directly targeting at certifying a GNN model against regular attacks* below.  \n\nWe note that the rationale of certified defense is to provably maintain the classification results against attacks. Under this context, most existing works on certifying an existing deep learning model focus on certifying a specific predicted label over a given data point. Here, the prediction results to be certified are classification results. Correspondingly, these works are able to directly certify the model itself.  \n\nHowever, the strategy above is not feasible in our studied problem. This is because we seek to certify the level of fairness of a group of nodes. The value of such a group-level property cannot be directly considered as a classification result, and thus they are not feasible to be directly certified. Therefore, we proposed to first formulate a classifier on top of an optimized GNN. As such, achieving certification becomes feasible. In fact, this also serves as one of the contributions of our work.  \n\nAccordingly, we have added a detailed discussion in Appendix C.1 in our paper. We thank the reviewer again for the constructive feedback.\n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: 2) The difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs should be clarified, especially how this difference affects the assumptions and theoretical results. It seems like the certification approach could also be applied without considering the binary sensitive attribute.\n\n**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that clarifying the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs would help the reader have a deeper understanding. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As suggested, we provide a detailed discussion about *(1) the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs* and *(2) applying the certification approach without considering the binary sensitive attribute* below.  \n\n**(1) What is the difference between the attacking performance of GNNs and the fairness of GNNs?**  \n\nIn traditional attacks over the performance of GNNs, the objective of the attacker is simply formulated as having false predictions on as many nodes as possible, such that the overall performance is jeopardized. However, in attacks over the fairness of GNNs, whether the goal of the attacker can be achieved is jointly determined by the GNN predictions over all nodes. Such node-level dependency in achieving the attacking goal makes the defense over fairness attacks more difficult, since the defense cannot be directly performed at the node level but at the model level instead. Correspondingly, this necessitates (1) constructing an additional classifier as discussed in the previous reply, and (2) additional theoretical analysis over the constructed classifier as in Theorem 1, 2, and 3 to achieve certification.  \n\n**(2) Can we apply the certification approach without considering the binary sensitive attribute?**  \n\nYes. In this work, we utilize the most widely studied setting to assume the sensitive attributes are binary. However, our certification approach is not designed to be tailored to the sensitive attributes. Therefore, our approach can be easily extended to scenarios where the sensitive attributes are multi-class and continuous by adopting the corresponding fairness metric as the function $\\pi(\\cdot)$ in Definition 1.\n\nWe have e also added a more detailed discussion in Appendix C.2 and C.3 of our paper accordingly. We thank the reviewer again for the great questions."

Correspondingly, we provide the discussion below.  \n\nMost existing works for robustness certification (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) can only defend against attacks on either node attributes or graph structure. Due to the multi-modal input data of GNNs, existing works usually fail to handle the attacks over node attributes and graph structure at the same time. However, ELEGANT is able to defend against attacks over both data modalities. This necessitates using both continuous and discrete noises for smoothing and the analysis for joint certification in the span of the two input data modalities (as shown in Figure 1). We have also added the discussion above in Appendix C.4 of our submission, and we thank the reviewer again for pointing this out.\n\n[1] Wang, B., Jia, J., Cao, X., & Gong, N. Z. (2021, August).

In addition, we would like to elaborate on the reasons why we originally did not involve them below. First, the attacking scenario studied in this paper is **model evasion attack**. Therefore, we originally did not involve [1] and [3] **since they study a different problem of data poisoning attack**. In addition, the approach proposed in this paper **does not have any overlap with the spectral analysis of GNNs**, and thus the proposed approach can be generalized to both spatial and spectral GNNs. Therefore, we originally did not involve [2] and [4] since they solely focus on the spectral analysis of spectral GNNs.  We thank the reviewer again for pointing this out, and adding them to our submission has made the discussion in this paper more comprehensive.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: For experiments, do there exist other defense methods that also defend the fairness-aware attack on graphs that could be included as baselines?\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We would like to clarify that the study on the fairness attack and defense over GNNs remains at an early stage. To the best of our knowledge, this paper serves as the first work studying the problem of fairness defense for GNNs. Therefore, **there is no other existing method** that defends the fairness-aware attack on graphs. Such an initial step presented in this paper also makes this research problem particularly interesting to us.  \n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: Minor: in Theorem 4, should \u201cCertified Defense Budget for Attribute Perturbations\u201d be \u201cCertified Defense Budget for Structure Perturbations\u201d?\n\n**Authors**: We agree with the reviewer that the title of Theorem 4 could be confusing for the readers. In fact, Theorem 4 presents the computation of the perturbation budget over the node attributes under binary noise on the graph structure. To avoid potential confusion, we have changed its name to \u201cCertified Defense Budget over Node Attributes\u201d. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out."

                        "value": "Thanks for your prompt feedback. We have explained to the reviewer wEZx about this concern in detail. We would also like to clarify your last concern below.  \n\nFirst, we assume that we are given a reasonable $\\eta$ as the threshold of the output bias level to be certified, where the bias level of the output of the GNN model should be less or equal to $\\eta$ . In other words, the output of the bias indicator function (defined in Def. 1) should be 1 before the randomized smoothing.\n\nThen, given the mentioned situation, we are able to certify the output of the smoothed bias function (defined in Def. 2) has the same output (i.e., having an output of 1) in the worst case. Note that the output of the smoothed bias function is directly calculated from the output of the GNN model. Consider the bias level of the output predictions associated with the smoothed bias function being 1 under the random noise as a random variable. Then the probability of such a random variable being less or equal to $\\eta$ should be larger than 0.5 according to the definition of the smoothed bias function in Def 2.  \n\nThe last step is to obtain the predictions for the test nodes. Since we have known that under the input noise, the output predictions of GNN will have a probability of at least 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\\eta$. Denote we have a prediction sample set $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as in Proposition 1) obtained from the Monte Carlo sampling, where each element in this set includes the output predictions for all test nodes. We then know each element in $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ will have at least a probability of 0.5 to be less biased than the threshold $\\eta$. Finally, we choose the least biased element in  $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$ (as the predictions for the test nodes), the chosen element will bear a probability that is small enough to be still more biased than $\\eta$ (as stated in Proposition 1). This completes the certification in practice.  \n\nWe believe this addresses your last concern, and we hope that you could also consider raising your score. We thank you again for your constructive feedback."

We provide a point-to-point reply below for the mentioned concerns and questions.\n\n---\n\n>  **Reviewer**: The technical contribution of this paper is a bit weak in that they mostly followed [1]. The main contributions merely lie in reframing the problems into the robustness on fairness.\n\n**Authors**: We thank the reviewer for bringing up [1]. However, we would like to clarify that the technical novelty of our work significantly differs from the contribution of [1]. Specifically, the contribution of [1] mainly lies in utilizing Gaussian to certify a specific predicted label with continuous input. However, such an approach cannot be directly used to tackle the problem studied in our paper. Reasons include: (1) the certification achieved by [1] **is not able to handle discrete input**; (2) the certification achieved by [1] **fails to achieve joint certification on a span over multiple input data modalities**; and (3) the certification achieved by [1] focuses on a specific data point **instead of the property of a group of data points**.  \n\nTherefore, we argue that other than formulating a novel research problem, the novelty of our work also lies in: (1) we proposed a strategy to properly handle the smoothing over graph topology; (2) we take the first step to achieve joint certification over the span of continuous and discrete data modalities (i.e., node attributes and graph topology), which is **particularly essential** for certifying Graph Neural Networks due to its natural multi-modality input; and (3) we establish a framework ELEGANT to achieve the certification of the property of a group of data points with the proposed techniques above.  \n\nIn fact, we note that the only connection between our work and [1] is that the same type of noise (i.e., Gaussian noise) is adopted to smooth the input data in the continuous domain (i.e., node attributes). We would like to argue that Gaussian noise is widely used in research based on randomized smoothing, and thus using Gaussian noise to smooth the continuous input data should not be considered to undermine the novelty.  \n\n[1] Cohen, J., Rosenfeld, E., & Kolter, Z.

We would like to clarify that improving fairness is a byproduct of ELEGANT, and our main focus is to achieve certification over the fairness level of the prediction results. However, as suggested, we provide a detailed discussion about why the fairness performance can be significantly improved in ELEGANT below.  \n\nAs mentioned in Section 3.4, the proposed strategy to obtain the output predictions in ELEGANT is to select the fairest result among the output set $\\hat{\\mathcal{Y}}'$. Such a strategy provides a large enough probability to achieve certification in light of Proposition 1. At the same time, we point out that such a strategy also helps to significantly improve fairness since outputs with a high level of bias are excluded.  As suggested, we also added the detailed discussion above in Appendix B.9 of our submission. We thank the reviewer again for the key question."

We have provided a comprehensive analysis of the certified robustness of fairness in our paper. To help understand the main analysis presented in this paper, we provide a brief summary regarding each lemma, theorem, and proposition presented in this paper.\n\n*Theorem 1. (Certified Fairness Defense for Node Attributes)*: This theorem gives a way to compute the perturbation-invariant budget (i.e., the budget within which the fairness level will not reduce under a certain threshold) of node attributes. However, since we consider both input data modalities could be attacked, we still need to extend the analysis over the span of node attributes and graph topology (see Theorem 4).  \n\n*Theorem 2. (Certified Defense Budget for Structure Perturbations)*: This theorem formulates an optimization problem, whose solution is the perturbation-invariant budget (i.e., the budget within which the fairness level will not reduce under a certain threshold) of graph topology under the smoothed node attributes. However, to solve this optimization problem, we need to explicitly compute $\\underline{P_{\\tilde{g}_{\\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$ (see Theorem 3).  \n\n*Theorem 3. (Positive Probability Lower Bound)*: This theorem provides a way to explicitly compute $\\underline{P_{\\tilde{g}_{\\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$, which directly enables us to solve the optimization problem in Theorem 2.  \n\n*Theorem 4. (Certified Defense Budget over Node Attributes)*: This theorem is built upon Theorem 1 and provides a way to explicitly compute the perturbation-invariant budget of node attributes over the span of node attributes and graph topology.  \n\n*Lemma 1. (Perturbation-Invariant Budgets Existence)*: This lemma claims the existence and tractability of the perturbation-invariant budgets on both data modalities, which is further detailed by Theorem 2 and Theorem 4.  \n\n*Lemma 2. (Positive Probability Bound Under Noises)*: This lemma claims the existence and tractability of $\\underline{P_{\\tilde{g}_{\\boldsymbol{X}}=1}}$, which is further detailed by Theorem 3.  \n\n*Proposition 1. (Probabilistic Guarantee for the Fairness Level of Node Classification)*: This proposition provides a neat probabilistic theoretical guarantee \u2014 we have a probability that is large enough to successfully achieve certified defense on fairness (i.e., obtaining results with a bias level lower than the given threshold).      \n\nWe hope the summary above helps address your concern. We have added the corresponding discussion in Appendix A.9 of our paper. We are also eager to learn more about your concern regarding any analysis that can be further clarified/added."
