                    "value": "This paper introduces a video pretraining method to enhance VIS (Video Instance Segmentation) performance and reduce the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning stages at the data and modeling levels. Specifically, in terms of data augmentation, this work introduces consistent pseudo video augmentation to maintain instance prediction consistency between the two stages. Furthermore, on the modeling front, it combines multi-scale temporal modules to enhance the model's understanding of time. In three VIS benchmark tests, the proposed approach in this paper outperforms all state-of-the-art methods."

The motivation behind addressing the gap between pretraining and fine-tuning in this paper is well-founded because simply transferring image pretraining to video fine-tuning does not effectively solve VIS (Visual Inertial Sound) problems.\n2. The quantitative results of this work are impressive, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods, as shown in Table 3 of the paper."

                    "value": "1. The video data augmentation employed in this work is not particularly novel. It primarily applies existing image adaptation methods to address the issue of video data augmentation. There are already well-established pseudo-video data augmentation methods in the field of VIS, such as [a], which also use techniques like rotation, cropping, and copy & paste for data augmentation. The paper does not provide a detailed explanation in Section 2.3 of how their approach differs from these existing methods. The paper presents a strategy for generating single-frame pseudo-video frames in Eq. (1), but it does not thoroughly explain how to generate continuous videos with natural and smooth transitions between pseudo-video frames. [a] Ctvis: Consistent training for online video instance segmentation. In IEEE Int. Conf. Comput. Vis., 2023.\n2. Another module in this work is the multi-scale temporal module (MSTM), which is a combination of Swin block (Liu et al., 2021) and ConvGRU (Lin et al., 2022), with the input being a simple concatenation of pseudo-video frames. Self-attention, cross-attention, and ConvGRU are relatively common components, and the paper should provide a detailed explanation and analysis of the role of this MSTM.\n3. The experimental results in this paper are not well-explained. For example, it is unclear which datasets and parameter configurations were used to generate the results in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 6. In particular, in the last row of Table 7, the results for AP(YV19) and AP(OVIS) do not seem to correspond to the performance results in Table 5."

For example, the passages \"Given the scarcity of video data...\" and \"Many online VIS...\" are repeated in both page 2 and page 3. The content \"Those existing augmentation approaches can appear...\" is duplicated on page 6. In the caption of Figure 3, \"the optimal performance is\" should be corrected to \"The optimal performance is achieved.\" The section \"4.3 Ablation studies\" on page 8 is placed incorrectly."

I believe this approach should at least reduce the computation during the fine-tuning stage to validate its effectiveness.\n- It is unclear if this method is benefitted from the \"temporal\" pre-training. Specifically, the augmentations that this paper uses also help image segmentation capacity. For instance, Table 4 and 6 show that image instance segmentation accuracy improves. However, as this paper is claiming that such augmentations \"temporal\" modeling, it is ambiguous if the improvements in the VIS benchmarks are driven from temporal modeling or massive computation involved during training.\n- This paper uses video sequence of 10 frames, which would require a gigantic GPU memory.\n\nMethodology:\n- I do not understand why the philosophy behind splitting features and recombining them. What's the necessity of this?\n- The method is supposed to be modeling \"temporal\" characteristics. Especially, because of the use of ConvGRU which models temporal aspects in a small sized conv window, pseudo videos must be somewhat temporally consistent. For instance, such videos should model natural movements of objects. However, the presented augmentation is mostly conducted with randomness, not fully considering the natural video aspects.\n\nLack of supporting experiments:\n- Just showing the improvements in terms of accuracy cannot validate the effectiveness of this augmentation as aforementioned.\n- What specific temporal modeling property does this augmentation help?\n\nPoor writing quality:\n- So many duplicates of sentences and paragraphs.\n    - Intro paragraphs 3-4 and 5-6.\n    - Paragraph 3 and 4 of Section 3.1.2.\n    - Many other sentences that essentially say the same thing.\n- I believe equation 1, 2, 3 are not necessary.\n- Not clear which model they are using. \"Model Setting\" part does not explain it in detail.\n- Typos and errors:\n    - Page 5 - \"The overall pipeline of video pre-training is illustrated in figure 7\" : not figure 7.\n    - Many other grammatical errors."
