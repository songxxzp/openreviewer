To implement this concept, they indirectly preserve causal relationships by controlling the variation of exogenous noise using non-linear ICA. They claim that the variation of exogenous noise is influenced by the representations learned by the exogenous regressor. In practice, they propose two methods, AR-L2 and AR-Nuc, which respectively control the magnitude and sparsity of variations in exogenous representations. In these two methods, the regularization terms measured by either the 2-norm or the nuclear norm of the value matrix is added to the objective function of CFVAE. The numerical results show that the proposed method has better D-score."

The authors write that \u201c[t]he lack of prior causal knowledge makes direct identification or approximation of these functions impossible. To overcome this, we propose that the process of the algorithmic recourse on the input features can be modelled as solely the manipulation of the exogenous noise of each sample, while the structural causal relationships among features remain.\u201d Conceptually, this is similar to backtracking, but the authors fail to discuss how [1] relates to their work, and most importantly how it is different from [1]. \n\n**Confusing notation and lack of clarity**: The paper fails to clarify their notation and methodologies, making it difficult for readers to follow the argument as the notation is not clear or inconsistent. Also, the paper tends to jump from one step to another without providing much explanation (e.g., see equation 2).  Some examples regarding these points include:\n  - Sometimes vectors are bold, sometimes they are not. Sometimes vectors are capitalized and non-bold.\n  - I cannot follow how the left-hand side of equation 2 implies the right-hand side. Can the authors clarify this?\n  - Is the outcome y multidimensional (as it is bold in your notation)? \n  - \u201cThe exogenous noise \u03c3 is conditionally exponential of order K of y.\u201d Is this a fixed term? I never have heard or read this. Can the authors clarify what that means?\n  - It\u2019s my understanding that you are using additive SCMs; why do you then use a general function f to describe the SCM. Wouldn\u2019t a linear function in form of a standard adjacency matrix suffice that excludes recursions?\n  - It remains unclear to me what the connection between being able to identify noise and obtaining sparse and causally correct recourses is. It is unclear how adding the proposed regularizes would lead to causally correct counterfactuals. Can the authors please elaborate? \n\n**Empirical evaluation**: The experimental evaluation appears unfair and might therefore be misleading. For example, the paper compares its results to CEM, which does no use SCMs, and to CFVAE, which estimates structural equations, while your method takes the (linear) SCM implicitly as given by using ICA. Could this be the reason why your method outperforms since all the experiments rely on data that is generated by linear structural equation models? It would thus probably be fairer to compare your method to standard causal recourse methods such as MINT and extend the experimental results to cases where data comes from other (generated) distributions that goes beyond linear SCMs. Finally, another reasonable work to compare is [2].\n\n----\n**References**\n\n[1] Von K\u00fcgelgen et al (2023), \u201cBacktracking Counterfactuals\u201d, 2nd Conference on Causal Learning and Reasoning, 2023 (CLEAR)\n\n[2] Pawelczyk et al (2022), \u201cDecomposing Counterfactual Explanations for Consequential Decision Making\u201d, Workshop on Socially Responsible Machine Learning (SRML) @ ICLR 2022"
