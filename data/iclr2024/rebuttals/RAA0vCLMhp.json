Semantic Concept Predictor predicts the relevant semantic concepts given initial semantic matrix and visual features. Then, Semantic Conditional Memory aggregates the semantic concepts through memory vectors and mechanism before feeding the memory responses to the diffusion decoder. Experiments show that the I2LTG model is able to achieve superior long-text generation performance, compared to existing works."

We summarize your main concerns as follows.\n\n> The proposed method requires semantic concepts to be obtained from existing datasets. There is no indication that the validation/test set was not used It would be cheating if the method indeed used validation/test set for extracting semantic concepts. There would be strong hints provided to the model.\n\nWe would like to clarify the details of extracting the semantic concepts. For the training of SCP, we obtain the semantic concepts based on the following procedures. First, we employ the NLTK POS tagger to annotate POS tags for each word in all image descriptions. Then, we set a threshold to filter out infrequent words. Based on the aforementioned processes, we are able to obtain three semantic concept lists corresponding to the training, validation, and test set. **For the concept list of training set, we manually delete the semantic word that appear in the lists of the valiadtion/test set, where we use the resulted list to train SCP.** Therefore, we make sure that there is no unfair comparison in our experiments. We will make this clear in the final version of our paper.\n\n> Not sure which visual backbone is used. Is it comparable to backbones used by other methods?\n\nFor your concerns of **vision backbones**, our approach uses **ResNet-101** as visual feature extractor, which is the same as other approaches (e.g., KiUT, Organ, R2GenRL) on MIMIC-CXR. For the compared approachs on **CC-SBU, LN, COCO-LT**, the image captioning approaches use **Fast R-CNN with initialization of ResNet's model weights, while LLM-based approaches adopt vision Transformer (ViT)**, where the compared approaches adopt stronger vision backbone models than ours. We will expain it clearer in our the final version of paper.\n\n> In 2.3, the word \"conditional\" is not mentioned at all. What is the point of calling the corresponding component as Semantic \"Conditional\" Memory?\n\nWe call the memory module as \"semantic conditional memory\", since it enhance the semantic representations from SCP with its stored information, and **provides conditional guidance for the diffusion networks**. We will make this clear in the final version of our paper."

Initially, SEMDIFF identifies main semantic concepts within images. It then leverages a memory network to convert these concepts into the diffusion networks to seamlessly integrate them, enhancing the long-text generation process. By doing so, SEMDIFF effectively tackles challenges like incoherence in non-AR text generation, particularly evident in lengthy texts by embedding external guidance within the diffusion iterative generation. The experimental evaluations are conducted on three public datasets, along with COCO-LT, which demonstrate the effectiveness of SEMDIFF over existing state-of-the-art solutions."

Notably, **the greater T also requires more inference time to generate an entire long text description**, where we find that generating an image description with **around 100 words takes 5 seconds** given T=1000.

How does it increase the model computation compared with baselines is not fully studied in the paper.\n\nWe agree with you that the computation complexity problem is existed in the image generation task, where diffusion models usually require thousands of NFE to generate images. **However, in the text modality that exists in the form of tokens, we draw the opposite conclusion.** The computational complexity of autoregressive (AR) models grows quadratically as sentences become longer, **which is particularly significant in the image-to-long text generation task.** Due to the characteristic of parallel generation of all tokens, the computational complexity of diffusion models is less than that of AR models. We will make this clearer in the final version of our paper.\n\n> The configuration regarding the settings of diffusion models is not clearly presented in the paper. How do you choose the diffusion schedule? Do you take DDIM/ODE or DDPM/SDE steps in the reverse process?\n\nWe follow the standard setup of diffusion schedule and diffusion sampler in Bit Diffusion [1], which use **cosine noise schedule** and **DDIM sampler** by default.

We summarize your main concerns as follows.\n\n> ...can the methods developed for MIMIC-CXR also be efficient on them? The authors did not explore this in the experiments. Also, some LLM are evaluated on them, while it is not sure if they are finetuned on the training sets.\n\nIn our preliminary experiments, we have actually tried adapting the methods developed for MIMIC-CXR to the image-to-long text generation task, which only obtains around 0.7 BLEU-4 score on COCO-LT dataset. The reason behind is the **domain gap between natural images and medical X-ray images**, where X-ray images differ greatly from natural images from both structures and contents.\n\n> Also, some LLM are evaluated on them, while it is not sure if they are finetuned on the training sets. As a simple 6-layer transformer encoder-decoder can achieve 0.054 of BL4, it is confusing why the LLM like LLAVA achieves only 0.06 after finetuning. I think this is an interesting point the author needs to explore further in the paper.\n\nIn our experiments, we evaluate LLAVA **without fine-tuning**. For the explanation of similar performance of ``Trans'' to LLM-based approach, we find that **LLM-based approaches have possibilities in generating irrelevent texts in the produced image description**, thereby obtaining inferior performance on image-to-long text generation datasets.\n\n> It is hard to tell if the proposed method is really better than the existing ones. One option here to prove their effectiveness is to adapt the proposed modules to the SoTA method.\n\nWe find that **existing studies have already obtained high performance on MIMIC-CXR**, so that the performance gain of our approach over them is limited. Thus, we further evaluate our approach on **LN, CC-SBU, and COCO-LT** , where our approach obtains more significant improvement compared to previous approaches. Specifically on CC-SBU, LN, and COCO-LT, our approach obtains **0.109, 0.092, and 0.093** BLEU-4 scores, respectively. \n\nPlease note that the improvement on MIMIC-CXR is assessed (t-test) wth significance (at **p<0.05** level), and meanwhile, such performance gain is similar in all previous RRG studies and ours seems even bigger than existing studies, which adequately proves its effectiveness, not mention that it also shows consistent and considerable improvements on other datasets.\n\n> ... Is the semantic concept set the larger the better? Are the predicted concepts the more the better for the long captioning generation?\n\nWe run experiments of performance on COCO-LT with respect to the semantic matrix size, which is presented as follows.\n\n|  Semantic Matrix Size   | BLEU-4  | \n|  ----  | ----  |\n| 5  | 0.032 |\n| 10  | 0.035 |\n| 15  | 0.039 |\n| 20  | 0.045 |\n| 25  | 0.049 |\n| 30  | 0.065 |\n| 35  | 0.081 |\n| 40  | 0.093 |\n| 45  | 0.080 |\n| 50  | 0.069 |\n\nResults indicate that **the semantic matrix has an optimal value**. When the semantic matrix is relatively small, the model gradually obtains better performance as its size enlarges, where the matrix is able to cover more related concepts with more essential semantic information stored with its vectors. Once the optimal value is reached, the model performance starts to degrade when the size keeps enlarging, since larger matrix size does not help in storing extra helpful semantic information.\n\n> I am also confused about Fig. 15 and 16. It seems $\\mathbf{h}_1$ is a probability of $\\mathbf{h}_1$, $\\mathbf{h}_2$, ... with other variables. While h is usually used as the \"hidden state\". I am not sure why $\\mathbf{h}_0$ equals the products of a set of probabilities. it \nseems $p(\\mathbf{h}_0|\\mathbf{h}^s, \\mathbf{h})$ would be more reasonable here. Please correct me if I have some misunderstanding.\n\nWe agree with your opinion that h could be improved in writing.$\\mathbf{h}_0$ represents **the clean bit representation that is totally de-noised from Gaussian noise**. We use $\\mathbf{h}_0$ as the variables since we regard the intermediate representation of diffusion networks as a type of hidden state. We will fix this in the final version of our paper."

Therefore, we run experiments to compare our performance with them on MS-COCO, and illustrate the results (including CIDEr) in the following table (the results of HAAV come from their paper). We will add the resuts in our the final version of the paper.\n\n|  Model   | BLEU-1 | BLEU-2 | BLEU-3 | BLEU-4 | METEOR | ROUGE-L | CIDEr |\n|  ----  | ----  |  ----  | ----  |  ----  | ----  |  ----  | ----  | \n| HAAV | - | - | - | 0.410 | 0.301 | - | 0.142 |\n| SCD-Net | 0.790 | 0.634 | 0.491 | 0.373 | 0.281 | 0.581 | 0.118 |\n| SeMDiff | **0.795** | **0.651** | **0.503** | **0.412** | **0.308** | **0.598** | **0.145** |\n\nOur approach obtains better performance than HAAV and SCD-Net.

Therefore, the comparison is fair. For the compared approachs on CC-SBU, LN, COCO-LT, the image captioning approaches use **Fast R-CNN with initialization of ResNet's model weights**, while **LLM-based approaches adopt vision Transformer (ViT)**, where the compared approaches adopt more powerful vision backbone models than ours.

If the results of SOTA are zero-shot, how about the fine-tuned performance on these datasets?\n\nIn our experiments, the reported results of existing state-of-the-art solutions are evaluated in a **zero-shot** manner while SeMDiff is **trained from scratch**. We will expain it clearer in our the final version of paper.\n\nFor the fine-tuned performance of existing state-of-the-art approaches, SCD-Net (fine-tuned) is able to obtain 0.0008 BLEU-4 score, which is limited compared to our performance (0.0934)."
