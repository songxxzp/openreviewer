While I admit that the paper made contribution in capturing the differences between using existing algorithmic stability methods to determine copyright infringement and applying copyright law, the technical contributions is not significant and do not help to address the problems. The main theoretical result is Proposition 1, which most people would likely anticipate. From my opinion, the most valuable part is Section 3, but this part does not contain any technical discussion.\n\n2.\tAnother issue with this paper is that critique of NAF and DP does not lead to new quantifiable algorithmic stability approach immediately, not does it shed light on how to modify these notions to better resonate with the essence of copyright law.\n\n3.  The paper lacks empirical or experimental results that would solidly substantiate its technical claims. For instance, 1) DP does not allow high influence under a satisfactory 'copyright definition', 2) NAF can allow models that may memorize completely the training set as long as a content they output does not provide a proof for such memorization.\n \n4. There is contradiction between the legal and technical discussions. For example, the authors initially assert that a satisfactory \"copyright definition\" must allow algorithms to be highly influenced. However, in discussing the 'overly exclusive' of algorithmic stability, they claim that protection is confined to concrete 'expressions' and does not encompass abstract \"ideas\".\n\n5. While the paper conceptually identifies the problem, it does not propose a practical solution or methodology to prevent copyright infringement, nor does it provide any discussions towards that end."

The entire discourse in Section 3 orbits around the disparity between practical application and algorithmic stability methods. These methods are not exclusively confined to Differential Privacy (DP), but are more associated with the more versatile concept of NAF. The main purpose of NAF is to provide a measurement of a model's copyright protection, rather than privacy protection. However, this discussion strays from the main theme of whether privacy can reduce to copyright. From my perspective, this paper is more centered on the incongruity between NAF and copyright protection in practice.\n\n3. please provide some experimental results to further support your claims on the limitation of DP and the flexibility of NAF.\n\n4.  clarify the contradictions between the legal and technical discussions, and provide empirical evidence if necessary.\n5. discuss the potential solutions\n\n\n3.\tOn page 9, I am still uncertain about the distinction between \"convert murky standards into rigid rules\" and \"make legal standards less murky\" in the context of computer science methodology.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for his careful reading, below we address the weaknesses and concerns.\n\n**the technical contributions**\n\nThe technical challenges behind our results are indeed not the main merit. Nevertheless, we do think that our results highlight that DP and NAF are more closely related than can be seen at first sight, and that both reduce to the requirement of a certain algorithmic stability that may be too prohibitive for the purpose of copyright infringement.\n\n**Another issue with this paper is that critique of NAF and DP does not lead to new quantifiable algorithmic stability approach immediately,**\n\nWe acknowledge this as not just a limitation, but as an inherent aspect of the current discourse on copyright. We believe that underscoring the discrepancies between legal interpretations of copyright and its perceptions within DP and NAF frameworks is an important contribution and also demonstrates the complexity and potential limitations of developing a universally applicable, technical model. Our work, therefore, initiates a crucial dialogue, suggesting that existing formal notions may be flawed, and we highlight inherent issues. This perspective is essential for guiding future research and policy-making in a direction that acknowledges and accommodates these inherent complexities.\n\n**The paper lacks empirical or experimental results that would solidly substantiate its technical claims. For instance, 1) DP does not allow high influence under a satisfactory 'copyright definition', 2) NAF can allow models that may memorize completely the training set as long as a content they output does not provide a proof for such memorization.**\n\n+ Regarding 1) We do not see how an experiment is in order here. As we discuss, there are works that can be blatantly non-private without infringing copyright. The experiment that the reviewer is proposing here would be something like running a generative AI exhaustively just to show that it will not generate a piece of art that parodies Shakespeare while preserving privacy of works by Shakespeare. That's not a realistic experiment, and we believe it is safe to say that a work that preserves privacy of A cannot parody or reference A.\n\n+ Regarding 2) This statement is about the definition of NAF -- NAF, in principle, allows memorization. We do not claim that any realistic setup, or implementation of NAF, will necessarily lead to memorization.\n\n**There is a contradiction between the legal and technical discussions. For example, the authors initially assert that a satisfactory \"copyright definition\" must allow algorithms to be highly influenced. However, in discussing the 'overly exclusive' of algorithmic stability, they claim that protection is confined to concrete 'expressions' and does not encompass abstract \"ideas\".**\n\nWe don\u2019t see the contradiction here. In fact, the claims are complementary. A satisfactory definition of copyright must allow algorithms to derive \u201cideas\u201d from previous work, but not to copy expressions. So some influence must be allowed, while other types of influences are not allowed.\n\n**On page 2, the authors mentioned \u201cWe further propose a different approach to using quantified measures in copyright disputes, to better serve and reconcile copyright trade-offs.\u201d However, I was not able to identify where in the paper this different approach is proposed.**\n\nWe provide a brief discussion at the final paragraph, but we will rephrase this statement as the reviewer is correct that we do not sufficiently discuss and delve into such an approach.\n\n**The title \"Can copyright be reduced to privacy?\" seems to be incoherent with the main subject matter and body of this paper. The entire discourse in Section 3 orbits around the disparity between practical application and algorithmic stability methods..**\n\nWe indeed argue in the paper that the issue is not with privacy but with algorithmic stability in general. Our title alludes to recent attempts to tackle copyright through privacy and privacy-like notions, but the paper itself expands beyond that.\n\n\n**On page 9, I am still uncertain about the distinction between \"convert murky standards into rigid rules\" and \"make legal standards less murky\" in the context of computer science methodology. If we intend to incorporate CS methodology into the legal profession to clarify legal standards, rigid rules are inevitable. Could the authors further elaborate on this?**\n\nOne potential contribution of CS methodologies to the law may be to provide evidence and quantitative information that could assist arbitrators in making informed decisions. That would still leave the judgement to a human that can assess and weight the pros and cons, without necessarily inflicting rigid rules.\n\n**The writing in some parts can be further improved. For example, what does $\\eta$ mean in Proposition 1.**\n\n$\\eta$ is the error parameter, and it affect the sample complexity. As two reviewers found this confusing, we will further clarify."

It is conceptually very difficult to separate (1) and (2), and the paper makes some attempts to clarify this line using DP/NAF, but I am not sure that it succeeds. On the other hand, (3) is very different and I am not sure that it is fair to critique NAF for excessive caution in saying that such examples have been copied.

It is conceptually very difficult to separate (1) and (2), and the paper makes some attempts to clarify this line using DP/NAF, but I am not sure that it succeeds.**\n\nWe are not trying to use DP/NAF in order to clarify the distinctive line between (1) and (2). We mainly critique the use of DP or NAF as measurements of such infringements. Partly, because it cannot provide such a quantitative degree of similarities\n\n\n**On the other hand, (3) is very different and I am not sure that it is fair to critique NAF for excessive caution in saying that such examples have been copied. They have, and we currently lack computational tools to analyze whether the copying is justified.**\n\nWe agree that we lack such computational tools. Currently, it is a matter of the court to decide. But, as we argue in the paper, requiring NAF and DP instead, will indeed be too excessive, and it will not allow copying that is justified That being said, it does not mean that NAF or DP are not a key elements in providing future tools to assess copyright infringement. But they shouldn't be regarded as exhaustive tools."

It appeals to the goals of copyright legislation and to examples of what does and does not count as copyright according to the legislation, but not to the definition of copyright itself.**\n\nWe do reference the statutory definition of copyright multiple times throughout the paper (U.S.C. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). 2006.). But this is done implicitly and we do not emphasize it, and we should provide here more background.\n\nThe \u201cdefinition\u201d, though, by itself, is an empty vessel. Like most complex legal concepts, it gains meaning only by court interpretation, which is the essence of this paper. We thank the reviewer for this comment, and below we provide a paragraph that will be incorporated in a future revision. This will help the reader to have better context:\n\nThe statutory definition of Copyright is defined in Section 102 of the Copyright Act. Subsection 102(a), which at a high level says that almost all imaginable works are protected (\u201cCopyright protection subsists\u2026 in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\u2026 include the following categories: \n1) literary.. \n2) musical.. \n3) dramatic.. \n4) pantomimes.. \n5) pictorial.. \n6) motion pictures.. \n7) sound..\n8) architectural..). \n\nFor the purposes of our work, the definition of the **limitation** of copyright is the core-essence, and we reference in several occasions. Those are provided in in subsection 102(b), which defines the limits of copyrights :  (\u201cIn no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery\u2026).\n\n**In a few places, there is an inconsistency between claims. For example, on page two, the authors state that they will focus on challenges to providing a definition of copyright, while in Section 2, the focus is on algorithmic stability as a surrogate for copyright. These two are not the same, and will involve different implications and challenges.**\n\nOur intent is to explore the challenges in defining copyright, and in doing so, we examine existing approaches that rely on algorithmic stability (DP and NAF). We aim to illustrate why such approaches (that are based on stability) may not adequately address the needs of copyright. We hope this explains the alleged contradiction.\n\n**How does the definition of copyright as it is found within U.S. legislation relate to your discussion?**\n\nPlease see our discussion above, and answer to (1). We hope it answers the question."

While algorithmic stability might seem like a useful method for identifying copying, it doesn't automatically ensure copyright protection. The authors pinpoint several discrepancies between algorithmic stability strategies and copyright regulations, illustrating why the implementation of such strategies might not fully consider fundamental copyright principles. Consequently, the paper suggests that if algorithmic stability techniques become the standard for addressing copyright infringement, they could undermine the original objectives of copyright law. The authors emphasize the necessity for any copyright concept to establish a clear distinction between protected expressions and unprotected ideas, highlighting a challenge that algorithmic stability concepts such as DP might not effectively address in certain cases. They provide instances where several elements of copyright law complicate the simplification of the copyright issue to a matter of privacy:\n - Copyright protections have a time limit, allowing works to enter the public domain after the expiration of protection. This implies that DP might be excessively stringent as a privacy notion. \n - Copyright law excludes certain subject matter from protection as they serve as raw material for cultural expression, a factor not readily addressed by privacy considerations. \n - Privacy protects content rather than expression, which differs from the scope of copyright law. \n - Copyright law promotes the use of copyrighted materials through specific transformative uses, including quotations and parodies, a dimension not fully encapsulated by privacy concerns.\n\nIn summary, the paper prompts critical thinking on why DP and NAF fail to effectively address the copyright problem. However, it lacks a comprehensive proposal for a practical resolution."

                    "value": "**No constructive copyright notion**. Authors look at special cases when DP or NAF would be too strict of a copyright notion and a relaxed notion could yield more benefit. While these special use cases make sense (e.g., Copyright is limited in time; copyright law encourages the use of copyrighted materials for transformative use cases) the authors merely identify these use cases without providing a technical copyright notion that would help make a step towards a more realistic copyright notion. In my view, both DP and NAF already do a good job at ensuring copyright law is upheld. As the authors note, to claim that the output of a generative model infringes copyright, a plaintiff must: \n 1. prove that the model had access to her copyrighted work; and\n 2. prove that the alleged copy is substantially similar to her original work.\n\nTherefore, it is my understanding that any reasonable algorithm to ensure copyright, must either make sure that the model behaves as if it had no access to the copyrighted work or that the model makes sure that the generated output is dissimilar to the original work. In my understanding, (1) is guaranteed by DP and in doing that DP is quite conservative, e.g., copyright law does allow the output to be influenced by the original work if it is sufficiently dissimilar from the original work which DP prohibits. Another strategy can lie in simply making sure that the generated output is dissimilar to the original work. This is what NAF aims to achieve targeting point (2). To summarize, the work does not offer a constructive solution that helps solve these problems.\n\n**Unclear theoretical results.** The theoretical results do not seem self-contained \u2013 e.g., to properly understand the paper, you must have read the work by Vyas et al (2023). Below are more concrete examples that are unclear: \n  - \u201cThe premise in the above theorem is identical to that in Theorem 3.1 in Vyas et al. (2023)\u201d: Does this mean that the full premise is stated in Proposition 1 or should the reader look at Theorem 3.1 of Vyas et al (2023) to understand the full premise of Proposition 1?\n  - Some terms are not properly introduced: e.g., what is a \u201csharded-safety setting\u201d?\n  - Proposition 2 is presented in section 2; but the discussion on its implications is provided in Section 4.\n  - In Proposition 1, eta is not defined.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the comments and critique, we next address these and discuss how we intend to improve those points that require clarification. \n\nWe do want to point out, however, that several of the points raised were already addressed in the paper itself. In addition, the reviewer has a different viewpoint and we respect that. But, we will focus, in our rebuttal, only on the content of the paper, and specifically on the arguments, as well as on supporting references and factual evidence, as they appear in the paper.\n\nBelow is a detailed response.\n\n**No constructive copyright notion.**\n\nWe acknowledge this as not just a limitation, but as an inherent aspect of the current discourse on copyright. We believe that underscoring the discrepancies between legal interpretations of copyright and its perceptions within DP and NAF frameworks is an important contribution and also demonstrates the complexity and potential limitations of developing a universally applicable, technical model. Our work, therefore, initiates a crucial dialogue, suggesting that existing formal notions may be flawed, and we highlight inherent issues. This perspective is essential for guiding future research and policy-making in a direction that acknowledges and accommodates these inherent complexities.\n\n\n**In my view, both DP and NAF already do a good job at ensuring copyright law is upheld.**\n\nThank you for your perspective on the effectiveness of DP and NAF in upholding copyright law. Our paper, however, reaches a contrary conclusion: in our work, we systematically outline the limitations of using NAF and DP as criteria for determining copyright infringement, with our arguments supported by references and factual evidence. Should you feel that we have misrepresented any evidence, we are open to further discussion and committed to refining our analysis.\n\nWe argue that the reliance on model access to copyrighted work and substantial similarity as the sole criteria for infringement is overly restrictive and may not align with the original intent of copyright law. Furthermore, our paper discusses why DP and NAF might not adequately safeguard these criteria. We look forward to a constructive dialogue on these issues and value your feedback in improving the depth and clarity of our work.\n\n**Therefore, it is my understanding that any reasonable algorithm to ensure copyright, must either make sure that the model behaves as if it had no access to the copyrighted work or that the model makes sure that the generated output is dissimilar to the original work.**\n\nThe points you've raised are central to our paper and are extensively discussed within it. We welcome specific refutations or challenges to our arguments for a more detailed dialogue\n\n**Unclear theoretical results. The theoretical results do not seem self-contained \u2013 e.g., to properly understand the paper, you must have read the work by Vyas et al (2023). Below are more concrete examples that are unclear:**\n\nThank you for your feedback. We'll enhance explanations, particularly about Vyas et al (2023), for better self-containment. Details on our additions are provided below\n\n+ \u201cThe premise in the above theorem is identical to that in Theorem 3.1 in Vyas et al. (2023)\u201d: Does this mean that the full premise is stated in Proposition 1 or should the reader look at Theorem 3.1 of Vyas et al (2023) to understand the full premise of Proposition 1?\n\nThe full premise is stated in proposition 1, no need to look at theorem 3.1. We will clarify this. Thanks.\n\n+ Some terms are not properly introduced: e.g., what is a \u201csharded-safety setting\u201d?\n\nWhat we mean here is that NAF with respect to sharded-safe function can be satisfied. This part is indeed not self contained and we will elaborate and explain more here, thanks.\n\n+ In Proposition 1, $\\eta$ is not defined. What is $\\eta$?\n\nThe statement says that if the sample scales with $O(1/\\eta)$ then the error scales with $\\eta$. As this led to a confusion with a second reviewer we will emphasize here the role of $\\eta$"
