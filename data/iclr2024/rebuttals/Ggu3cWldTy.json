                    "value": "### Comments I made while reading\n\n> As one of the most popular algorithms, mirror descent (MD) (Vural et al., 2022)\n\nIt's a bit strange to cite a paper from 2022 as the main reference for mirror descent.\n\n---\n\n> A decision-making problem, either single-agent, cooperative multi-agent, competitive multi-agent,\nor mixed cooperative-competitive settings, can be described as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) (Oliehoek & Amato, 2016)\n\nThis is **not true**. A Dec-POMDP is necessarily fully cooperative (see Oliehoek & Amato, 2016). A better formalism to encompass the problem settings the submission cares about is partially observable stochastic games (POSGs).\n\n---\n\nIn the problem statement section, the submission includes the idea that it is considering soft-optimal policies (as opposed to optimal) as a footnote. This is a big difference and ought to be defined rigorously and not merely listed as a footnote.\n\nFurthermore, the submission's presentation of its solution concept has some issues. First, it is actually unclear what solution concept the submission is using because H(pi_i) is not defined. Does it mean H(pi_i(\\tau_i^t)) or does it mean the expected entropy accumulated by pi_i? Second, the submission claims that this solution concept is a Nash equilibrium. Yet, given the presence of entropy regularization, it is clear not a Nash equilibrium. If it H(pi) = H(pi_i(\\tau_i^t)), then it is an agent quantal response equilibrium, which is a well-established solution concept.\n\n---\n\n> In other cases, the evaluation metric for a joint policy is the distance of the policy to the NE, called the NE-Gap\n\nIn zero-sum games, there's an obvious justification for this evaluation metric. However, in general-sum games it's less clear that NE-Gap is meaningful. At the very least, this merits some discussion.\n\n---\n\n> little has been known for more complicated cases including general-sum and mixed cooperative-competitive settings.\n\nThis isn't exactly right. It's known that computing equilibria in these settings is computationally hard. Yet, there are still many works studying the settings. Perhaps most significantly (at least on the empirical side), is recent work on Diplomacy (specifically, Mastering the Game of No-Press Diplomacy via Human-Regularized Reinforcement Learning and Planning). However, note that this line of research neither uses Nash equilibria nor quantal response equilibria as the solution concept.\n\n---\n\nIn section 4, the solution concept of interest becomes clear via equation (2). (Specifically, that the submission is studying quantal response equilibria.)\n\n---\n\n> In single-agent and two-player zero-sum (i.e., purely competitive) settings, the most commonly used method to solve the problem (2) is mirror descent.\n\nThis is a big claim and I don't think it's true. At least most single-agent RL papers do not use mirror descent. For two-player zero-sum games, other methods based on homotopies are also common.\n\n---\n\n> f is called the regularizer\n\nI'm not sure what this means. In mirror descent, f in equation (3) would be the Bregman divergence. Is the submission just using a different name for Bregman divergence (if so, why?)?\n\n---\n\nIn section 4.1, it becomes clear that the submission does not use f to mean a Bregman divergence. **This is an issue** because it means that equation (3) is not necessarily a mirror descent update rule.\n\n---\n\nAll of the material from the start of Section 4.1 up through equation (8) can be found in (Sokota et al., 2023). Using this material without clear attribution is sketchy, at best. The right thing to do here would be to include this material as background, not in the contribution section.\n\n---\n\nAfter the derivation of (8), the submission discusses a seemingly ad hoc projection. This doesn't make a lot of sense. The required projection for (magnetic) mirror descent is dictated by the Bregman divergence. It is not truly an instance of (magnetic) mirror descent with the normalization scheme suggested by the submission.\n\n---\n\nThere ought to be a new paragraph after the period here: \"with the Euclidean distance. In addition,\"\n\n---\n\nI'm a bit unclear on equation (9). Is phi part of the summation? If not, then this is a special case of the optimization problem that was already stated? If so, then this isn't computing an agent quantal response equilibria.\n\n---\n\nIn the RS algorithm, what exactly is L in each setting?\n\n---\n\nGiven the lack of clarity about the solution concept, the experimental results are also unclear. As best I can tell, the submission is using agent quantal response equilibria. However, agent quantal response equilibria are not solutions to minimax problems, so I do not know what the submission means by \"gap\" in Figure 4.\n\n---\n\n> (iv) For the four baselines, none of them can consistently outperform all the others across different types of games, which supports the motivation of this work\n\nHow did the submission select the hyperparameters for each of the algorithms. This plays an important role in the results. Also, how much regularization is the submission using? This also plays an important role. The claim above is unjustified without details on these issues and without clarification on what the y-axis is measuring.\n\n---\n\nFor the tiny Hanabi results, I would be interested to see performance on games E and F as well.\n\n---\n\nRegarding the summarizing results in Figure 1, it seems like the normalized improvement of UMD over KL is at most small and sometimes significantly less than 1 (such as in Leduc). This raises some questions as to whether it's worth the effort.\n\n---\n\nAre all of the results full feedback?\n\n---\n\nIs the submission is also using the same magnet update scheme for the Euclidean version? That would be incorrect -- the Euclidean version needs to update the magnet with a Euclidean update (i.e., $\\rho_{k+1} = (1 - \\hat{\\eta}) \\rho_k + \\hat{\\eta} \\pi_{k+1}$).\n\n---\n\nOne thing I'm a bit confused about is that it seems like the update equations are solving for different for different things. KL and EU with moving magnets are trying to solve for Nash. But ME and ML are trying to solve for phi regularized equilibria? Does the submission actually tell the reader what phi ME and ML are using?\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThere are a variety of basic issues that make it hard to seriously consider the submission for acceptance. Some are summarized below:\n- The submission incorrectly defines fundamental terms Dec-POMDP and Nash equilibria.\n- The material in 4.1 up through equation 10 is background material, not the contribution.\n- The \"practical version\" of equation 8 is (for unclear reasons) not even an instance of (magnetic) mirror descent.\n- The evaluation metric is unclear. The submission seems like it's actually using agent quantal response equilibria, but there's no such thing as an AQRE gap.\n- It is unclear based on the description in the text whether the candidate algorithms are even solving for the same solution concept."

In my opinion this is the main bottleneck of the approach and it would be good to understand whether such extra computation and knowledge (to estimate the gradients) is indeed necessary."

It proposes unified mirror descent (UMD) algorithm, which convexly combines four mirror descent-based update rules and uses zeroth-order optimization methods to find the combination weights. It conducts extensive experiments on 24 benchmark environments and shows that UMD can perform comparably or better than all other baselines in most benchmark environments."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "One major weakness of this paper is that it provides very little justification of the proposed algorithms. For example, it is not clear that \"*UMD could inherit the properties of these algorithms*\" even from an intuitive perspective. From my perspective, **UMD** implicitly assumes that the optimal solution set of the problem is convex since if it is not convex and the four different update rules converge to different optimal solutions, then a convex combination of them can easily result a suboptimal solution. Is that possible to run experiments on an environment with non-convex optimal solution set? From this point of view, running experiments using neural networks-based policy on more complicated environments is critical since they have more complicated optimal solution set.\n\nAnother weakness is that **UMD** looks more like an algorithm selection strategy than an algorithm framework, if my understanding is correct. In particular, based on the experiment results in Figure 1, although **UMD** outperforms or matches the baselines in many environments, it outperforms all baselines in only a few settings. That is, a naive strategy such as \"running all four update rules and picking the best one\" will perform comparably with **UMD** without consuming more computational resources. From this point of view, it can be hard to see the advantage of using **UMD**.\n\n### Suggestions on Writing\n- Figure 1 can be put at a better place. For now, it is first mentioned in text on page 7 but placed on page 2.\n- The presentation clarity of section 4.1 can be significantly improved. For example, should we add all $\\pi_k$'s in the RHS of Eq. (6), (8) and (10) with corresponding superscripts \"KL\", \"EU\", \"ME\" and \"ML\"? If not, $\\pi_{k+1}$'s in the LHS of Eq. (5) and (7) should be added with corresponding superscripts. Other clarification questions are given in **Questions** section."

What is the definition of $\\hat{\\eta}$? Is this magnet policy update rule the same for both \"KL\" and \"EU\" or does \"EU\" have different update rule for $\\rho$? Or do update rules of both $\\pi^{\\mathrm{KL}}$ and $\\pi^{\\mathrm{EU}}$ use the same magnet policy $\\rho$?\n- Where is the part of the policy update rules that utilizes Eq. (9)?\n- Does $v_k(a)$ denotes a single-step reward or the cumulataive reward? Can you define it mathematically?\n- Is the objective $\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha)$ defined with respect to the current policy? If yes, then it looks $\\mathcal{L}(\\alpha)$ is a constantly changing objective. Then, why can the proposed hyperparameter optimization method still work?\n- It seems the update magnitude of $\\alpha$ is determined by purely random sampling. Why can this random sampling work?"

The algorithm works in a Decentralized-POMDP setup and look for a policy in optimizing value function in single / cooperative case, and approaching Nash-Equilibrium otherwise.\n\n## Construction\n- The key construction of this algorithm is, at each moment (time) and for each agent, the convex combination of 4 external  basepolicy updates from *Mirror descent*: limiting update step via KL / Euclidean, and Linear / Exponential Multiplicative Weight Updates. The construction of the 4 external policies contains the processing of the whole Dec-POMDP environment, which are inherited by this algorithm, thus the construction can be reduced to deal with only one agent at each particular time.\n\n- In the above construction, only the coefficients $\\alpha$ of the convex combination is modifiable. The rest of the algorithm is to optimize $\\alpha$ gradually. Two options of updating $\\alpha$ is given: \n    - Random Search\n    - GradientLess Descent\n\nAssembling the above 2 parts, one can find a policy in updating 4 policies together with the coefficients in a same updating sequence.\n\n## Experiments\n24 environments are given in the above 5 types of games. They can converge in iterations following the best one of the 4 base policy."

By using convex combination of the updating steps, or roughly say *gradients*, it is equivalent to optimize the same convex combination of the external base objective functions. The authors probably could analyse the simplex $\\Delta$ (of dimension 3) of all convex combinations of the objective functions, and state the effectiveness and generalisability of the method in this way.\n\n2. Following Question 1, why is the **optimal policy** occurs within the simplex and what does the optimal policy, as the convex combination of 4 existing policies, really mean?\n\n3. By combining the result policies of the 4 algorithms, is there a problem which could not be solved by any of them but the UMD method can solve?\n\n4. Minor: On page 5, when introducing ME and ML updating methods, I did not find the definition of $v_k$ and $\\phi$.\n\n5. In this unified framework, is there any evidence of the (possible) completeness of base methods, even for a single kind of methods? Or in other words, could there be a choice of complete methods $\\mathcal{M}(P)$ for problem $P$, such that adding any other methods (equivalently, adding additional objective function) would result in that the components of $\\alpha$ outside the complete set $\\mathcal{M}(P)$ would always converge to 0."
