For example, the claim in Figure 1 that \"RetNet makes the 'impossible triangle' possible\" is an absolute overclaim because the paper lacks validation with larger models and comparison with open-source Transformer models. On the other hand, the authors claim that RWKV and Linear Attention perform poorly, but according to [1], [2], their performance can be on par with Transformers. In Section 2, the authors introduce a new term called \"Retention,\" but this is essentially the same as Linear Attention without the denominator, which has already been proposed in [2], [3]. Additionally, the use of EMA in MEGA and RWKV has been implemented, but the authors fail to cite these works.\n\n\n[1] Bo Peng, Eric Alcaide, Quentin Anthony, Alon Albalak, Samuel Arcadinho, Huanqi Cao, Xin Cheng, Michael Chung, Matteo Grella, Kranthi Kiran G.

                    "value": "1. Figure 1 is an absolute overclaim because RWKV[1] and H3[2] have already demonstrated models at the billion-scale level that can achieve performance comparable to Transformers, with parallel training and constant inference. I suggest the authors remove this figure as it could mislead readers.\n2. The description of RWKV in Table 1 is completely wrong. According to RWKV[1] and the description in [2], RWKV can indeed be computed in parallel. On the other hand, according to the RWKV paper, its performance is comparable to Transformers, so describing its performance as \u2714 is also inaccurate. Overall, Table 1 is highly misleading and can affect the authors' judgment of model performance. I suggest the authors reorganize this table accordingly. \n3. The form of Equation 1 is similar to RFA-GATE presented in [7], but the authors did not cite these articles throughout the paper.\n4. The form of GroupNorm in Equation 8 is consistent with the NormAttention proposed in [5], but the author does not cite it at all.\n5. There is a mistake in the description of the Linear Attention section in Section 2.4. Firstly, Linear Attention refers to the use of the Right-product trick to reduce complexity, but it does not necessarily imply approximation. For example, [4], [5], and [6] do not involve an approximation approach like softmax. \n6. The statement \"However, linear attention struggles to effectively encode position information, rendering the models less performant\" should be supported by a reference since there could be various reasons for the poor performance. Moreover, the issue of the performance of Linear Attention has already been addressed in [5], where they propose a solution.\n7. The discussion about MEGA and MEGA-chunk is missing, as they are similar to RetNet in utilizing the EMA technique.\n8. Table 2 lacks comparison with open-source models. Firstly, the configuration of the Transformer is not mentioned, whether it is based on GPT2 architecture or Llama architecture. Additionally, there is no information provided regarding the parameter count or training data. On the other hand, there is no comparison with open-source models such as Bloom, Pythia, GPT-Neo, or RWKV. Comparing with these open-source models would allow readers to better understand the performance level of the proposed model. \n9. The evaluation scope is too limited, for example, MMLU is not assessed.\n10. It is indeed odd that the evaluation datasets in Tables 4 and 5 are inconsistent with Table 3. There should be further explanations provided to clarify this discrepancy.\n11. There is a lack of ablation analysis on the architectural design, such as why the dimension of $W_v$ is chosen as d * 2d. On the other hand, an ablation for adding head dimension should be included in Table 5.\n\n[1] Bo Peng, Eric Alcaide, Quentin Anthony, Alon Albalak, Samuel Arcadinho, Huanqi Cao, Xin Cheng, Michael Chung, Matteo Grella, Kranthi Kiran G.

                        "value": "Q1: \u201cImpossible Triangle\u201d is an absolute overclaim because RWKV and H3 have already demonstrated models are comparable to Transformers\n\nA1: The claim is fair enough. The \u201ccomparable performance\u201d means that the models achieve similar results under the same setting (e.g., #parameters, and training corpus). For example, previous comparisons use Transformers with absolute position while the compared methods benefit from relative position modeling. Moreover, in H3 paper, the comparable results are in hybrid settings (i.e., combine H3 and Transformer layers), but we don\u2019t add any Transformer layers. We conducted various controlled experiments (with matched #parameters and using the same training corpus) to compare different architectures. We are confident that the claim holds well. The experiments in Table 4 also show that previous methods still have a big gap.\n\n\nQ2: RWKV can indeed be computed in parallel.\n\nA2: We give a clear definition on \u201ctraining parallelization\u201d in the caption of Table 1, which is discussed from the sequential perspective. \u201c\u2217\u201d: whether the training implementation is sequentially parallelized, although RWKV uses channel-wise parallelism. As stated in A1, RWKV\u2019s performance is actually not comparable with Transformers according to our experiments (i.e., same #parameters, same data, and with relative position modelings). So, the statement of RWKV in Table 1 is fair enough.\n\nQ3: The form of Equation 1 is similar to RFA-GATE\n\nA3: Eq. (1) and RFA-GATE are not the same. Linear Attention is a candidate for RFA-Gate, where they both have denominators. In contrast, Eq. (1) does not include $A$. We can add the citation as suggested.\n\nQ4: The form of GroupNorm in Equation 8 is consistent with the NormAttention.\n\nA4: GroupNorm is significantly better than LayerNorm for multi-scale retention, as different heads have different statistic information. The implementation is different from NormAttention here. We can discuss the difference in the paper.\n\n\nQ5: There is a mistake in the description of the Linear Attention section in Section 2.4.\n\nA5: \u201capproximating softmax\u201d means that previous methods also encode a \u201cprobability distribution\u201d on different positions, which is valid in [4] and [6]. Moreover, \u201cLinear Attention\u201d is not \u201cLinearized Attention\u201d, it stands for the paper \u201cTransformers are RNNs: Fast autoregressive transformers with linear attention\u201d. \n\nQ6: The statement \"However, linear attention struggles to effectively encode position information, rendering the models less performant\" should be supported by a reference since there could be various reasons for the poor performance.\n\nA6: Previous methods use kernel methods on query and key, which brings difficulty on relative position such as RoPE, where RoPE produces negative values for denominators. Otherwise the attention scores tend to become too flatten. [5] uses block softmax attention as an ad-hoc solution to make attention local.\n\nQ7: The discussion about MEGA and MEGA-chunk is missing, as they are similar to RetNet in utilizing the EMA technique.\n\nA7: RetNet has no direct connection with EMA technique. Instead, EMA is a weaker version of S4, so it\u2019s convincing to compare with H3, which is a stronger baseline."

                        "value": "Q8: Table 2 lacks comparison with open-source models.\n\nA8: We use Transformers with RoPE relative positions, which is a relatively strong baseline. Compared with LLaMA, there are only two differences: RMSNorm and SwiGLU. Specifically, RMSNorm typically improves stability instead of performance. Both RMSNorm and SwiGLU are orthogonal to our work. As long as the comparison settings are rigor and fair, the conclusions are solid. I totally understand you would like to compare different checkpoints, although they usually used different training data, data preprocessing pipelines, architecture configurations, number of training tokens, and hyperparameters. The paper focuses on fair comparisons rather than chasing for benchmarks.\n\nQ9: The evaluation scope is too limited.\n\nA9: \nThe language modeling perplexity correlates very well with different tasks. Moreover, the language models have unified all tasks as generation. We report language modeling perplexity and various downstream task performance. We didn\u2019t evaluate translation because our training corpus contains English data instead of multilingual data. We additionally evaluate one-shot performance on two open-ended question answering tasks with 7B models as follows. Notice that we report the recall metric in the table, i.e., whether the answers are contained in the generated response.\n\nDataset / Transformer / RetNet\n\nSquad / 67.7 / 72.7\n\nWebQS / 36.4 / 40.4\n\nQ10: the evaluation datasets in Tables 4 and 5 are inconsistent with Table 3\n\nA10: We divide our evaluation into two groups: large scale comparison with Transformers and small size with other baselines. Evaluating perplexity is a stable and predictable metric for language modeling. We mainly report end-task accuracy numbers for larger-size models while reporting perplexity for small-size models. As indicated in previous work ([2304.15004] Are Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models a Mirage?), perplexity is smoother and more robust than accuracy for small models.\n\nQ11: There is a lack of ablation analysis on the architectural design.\n\nA11: The dimension modification of $W_v$ and FFNs aim to align the same parameter count with Transformers. Besides, increasing head dimension is harmful for inference efficiency. So the current setting is more scientific for evaluation."

Compared to Linear Transformers, Recurrent Networks, and Transformers, Retentive Networks can train in parallel, are low cost in inference, and have high quality. This paper discusses an interesting architectural design space where: 1) Transformer model families are inference inefficient while can be trained in parallel and are high quality; 2) Recurrent Networks on the other hand, can run inference relatively at lower cost but cannot be trained efficiently. The proposed Retentive Networks achieves all three by introducing a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention. The method is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. The chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. Empirical resuolts decodes 8x faster and saves 70% of memory compared to Transformer. During training, it is 7x faster with 20%-50% lower memory."

                        "value": "Q1: The paper is not clear to the reviewer why these two forms in Figure 2 (a) and Figure 2 (b) are equivalent.\n\nA1: The equivalency between parallel and recurrent form is discussed mathematically from Eq. (1) to Eq. (6), where Figure 2a is for Eq. (5), and Figure 2b is for Eq. (6).\n\nQ2: Are there any theoretical proof that retention is more capable than full attention?\n\nA2: The comparable capabilities are evaluated empirically in the submission. For retention, we allow negative values for \u201cretention scores\u201d. In comparison, full attention only allows positive values for attention scores. If we consider finite arithmetic precision in practice, retention potentially utilizes the capacity more sufficiently without wasting the negative numerical ranges. The claim \u201cFull attention should be more capable than recurrent networks\u201d is not trivial because attention is often worse than RNN or S4 under many tasks, such as learning formal language.\n\nQ3: two model architectures should not cross over when scaling the model up in log scale.\n\nA3: Here we are comparing two different architectures in one figure. The curves do not cross over for the same architecture. But it doesn\u2019t hold anymore if we compare different methods. If the learning curve is $f(m)=\\alpha m^{\\beta_g}+\\gamma$, there are three variants $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$. When $f_1(m) = f_2(m) $ and $\\beta_{g1} > \\beta_{g2}$, it\u2019s possible that two lines are cross over. Our scaling curves are not contradictory with early papers.\n\nQ4: Do you have results on generative tasks like translation and question answering?\n\nA4: The language modeling perplexity correlates very well with different tasks. Moreover, the language models have unified all tasks as generation. We report language modeling perplexity and various downstream task performance. We didn\u2019t evaluate translation because our training corpus contains English data instead of multilingual data. We additionally evaluate one-shot performance on two open-ended question answering tasks with 7B models as follows. Notice that we report the recall metric in the table, i.e., whether the answers are contained in the generated response.\n\nDataset / Transformer / RetNet\n\nSquad / 67.7 / 72.7\n\nWebQS / 36.4 / 40.4"

Similarly as state space models (SSMs) and Linear Attention models, RetNet can be formulated both in a parallel and recurrent views, achieving parallel training and efficient inference/decoding. \n\nThe authors conducted experiments on large-scale pre-training form language modeling, with model size from 1.3B to 13B. The proposed RetNet obtained better zero/few-shot performance on benchmarks than standard Transformer. And the speed and memory efficiency of RetNet is also slightly better than Transformer with Flash Attention."

                    "value": "There are several serious concerns about this paper:\n\n1. Table 1 is mis-leading. If I understand correctly, the recurrent state $s_n$ in Eq (1) is in the shape of $d\\times d$, where $d$ is the model dimension and is very large in practice (sometimes even larger than $N$). In S4 or other SSMs, the shape of the recurrent hidden state is $h\\times d$ with relatively small $h$, e.g. $h=32$. However, in Table 1 the authors claimed the inference cost of RetNet is $O(1)$.\n\n2. Table 3 is unclear. If I understand correctly, the parallel representation in Eq(5) is used for model training. However, the complexity of Eq(5) is almost the same with standard attention mechanism, with only difference that it does not need to compute softmax. Then why RetNet is faster and using less-memory than Flash Attention? Flash Attention also leveraged the block-wise computation of the attention matrix, which is similar to the chunkwise representation of RetNet. In addition, which version of Flash Attention was used in these experiments? Flash Attention v2 has been significantly optimized. \n\n3. The experimental setting is unconvincing. Though the authors scaled-up RetNet to 13B, the total number of training tokens are only 100B. It is well-known that Transformer is data-eager, and it is unfair to compare with Transformer with relatively small training data. Moreover, the improved version of Transformer in Llama (with RMSNorm and SwiGLU) has achieved significantly better results than the standard Transformer. But all the comparisons in this paper are with standard Transformer.\n\n4. In Table 1, the authors claimed that only Transformer and RetNet are achieving \"good performance\". However, there are no direct comparison of RetNet with other models in large-scale setting. The results in Table 4 were conducted with a small 200M model size and only 5B tokens."

                        "value": "Q1: The inference cost is not constant\n\nA1: Eq. (1) is discussed under one-head settings. We still use multi-head in Eq. (8), and the shape of $s_n$ is $h\\times d$, where $h$ is query and key's head dimension. So the inference cost will be $O(1)$. Our inference cost experiment in Figure 4 demonstrates that.\n\nQ2: why RetNet is faster and using less-memory than Flash Attention?\n\nA2: For the comparison with FlashAttention, we use an optimized FlashAttention, which is better than FlashAttention1 and is comparable with FlashAttention2 for long sequences. Since the publication time of FlashAttention2 is later than ICLR submission deadline, we didn't compare with the official one in the submission.\n\nQ3: the total number of training tokens are only 100B. It\u2019s not enough since Transformer is data-eager.\n\nA3: According to the Chinchilla scaling law, 7B model\u2019s converge speed slows down at $FLOPs=10^{21}$. The flops for 100B tokens are more than $(7\\times 10^ 9) \\times (100 \\times 10^ 9) \\times 6 > 4\\times 10^{21}$. So 100B tokens are enough for evaluating model performance.\n\nQ4: the improved version of Transformer in Llama (with RMSNorm and SwiGLU) has achieved significantly better results than the standard Transformer.\n\nA4: The LLaMA improvement is on training stability and FFN capacity, which is useful regardless of attention or other token-mixing methods. RMSNorm and SwiGLU can also be applied to RetNet. The comparisons under standard Transformer are fair.\n\nQ5: there are no direct comparison of RetNet with other models in large-scale setting.\n\nA5: The conclusions of comparing with other architectures are consistent even with larger-scale training. Scaling up every method went beyond our computation budget. As the de facto architecture is Transformer now, we spent more resources on the comparisons with Transformers, where we ran the experiments in large-scale settings.\n\nQ6: Missing citations.\n\nA6: We can add the suggested paper \u201c[1] Hua et al., Transformer Quality in Linear Time\u201d in the revision."
