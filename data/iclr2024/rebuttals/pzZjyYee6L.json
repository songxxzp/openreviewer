Instead of directly predicting the position coordinates (x, y), the authors proposed three alternative output representations:\n* Predicting (vx, vy)\n* Predicting (ax, ay)\n* Predicting (speed, heading)\n\nThe authors implemented the three approaches on the Motion Transformer (MTR) model. The evaluation result on the WOD dataset shows that by predicting (vx, vy), they improve the prediction mAP by 2.376%."

The related work section claims that none of the existing trajectory works uses the bicycle kinematic model, which is not true. There are many existing trajectory prediction models (such as MultiPath++ [1] and DKM [2]) that explicitly predict future accelerations and steering angles and roll out future trajectories using the bicycle kinematic model.\n\n[1] Varadarajan et al. 2022. Multipath++: Efficient information fusion and trajectory aggregation for behavior prediction.\n\n[2] Cui et al. 2019. Deep Kinematic Models for Kinematically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Predictions.\n\n* This paper talks about the advantages of using the bicycle kinematic model as the prior for trajectory prediction. However, none of the three proposed formulations used the actual bicycle kinematic model. From the result in Table 1, Formulation 1 has the best performance, and Formulation 1 is simply to predict deltas between waypoints.\n\n* The evaluation result lacks some important information. The tables only show the relative improvement from the MTR baseline. However, it is not clear whether the MTR numbers are from the MTR paper, the WOD leaderboard, or from the authors' own implementation. I highly recommend the authors submit their solution to the WOD leaderboard and report the numbers from the leaderboard.\n\n\n--- Other minor comments\n\n* Please add equation numbers.\n\n* I am not sure sigma_{x + vx * dt} = sigma_x + sigma_{vx} * dt is correct. The summation of two Gaussian variables x + y should be sigma_{x + y} = \\sqrt{sigma_x ^ 2 + sigma_y ^ 2}.\n\n* Reference Chai et al., 2020a and Chai et al., 2020b are the same paper."

We clarify how we approach kinematic priors in our method differently from existing work in the general response above, and will make sure to incorporate revisions accordingly in the paper. We agree that the idea of using kinematic priors is not new to trajectory forecasting tasks, and thus will re-frame the contributions accordingly, as we believe previous work considered kinematic models *deterministically* rather than *probabilistically*, which remains as our key contribution over prior works and the key differentiator.  This formulation offers several benefits as we stated above in the general response.\n\nWhile the kinematic model derivations are straightforward, the additional novelty is the consideration of the relationship between variances of kinematic variables and resulting trajectories. Mean kinematic variables and mean trajectories are considered in previous work directly, but the *disadvantage is the loss of expressiveness reflected in trajectory distributions when assuming a Gaussian model of decision making*.   *This issue* is what we address in the paper.\n\nHopefully this answers some of your questions, and thank you for your review!"

For some examples of works which use some variant of bicycle, unicycle or other kinematic model for trajectory forecasting in the context of self driving:\n\n* Imagining The Road Ahead: Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction via Differentiable Simulation\n* Deep Kinematic Models for Kinematically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Predictions\n* A Kinematic Model for Trajectory Prediction in General Highway Scenarios\n* MixSim: A Hierarchical Framework for Mixed Reality Traffic Simulation\n* Guided Conditional Diffusion for Controllable Traffic Simulation\n\nAs these are papers that simply come top of mind / found after a brief literature review, I may have missed more and thus I encourage the authors to add this list after performing a more thorough literature review. For the rebuttal I'd like to see the authors more clearly position their work in the context of existing literature.\n\n\n**2) Experiments**\nThe paper was unclear about the baseline performance. Specifically, did the authors compare to the original MTR, or a re-implemented and retrained version of MTR? I found the following statements in the paper:\n> We implement kinematic priors on state-of-the-art method Motion Transformer (MTR) Shi et al. (2022), which serves as our baseline method.\n\n> ... we downscale the model from its original size of 65 million\nparameters to 2 million parameters and reproduce baseline results in our experiments\n\n> We compare our model against the state-of-the-art architecture...\n\nIn all tables in both the main paper and the appendix, the results are written as relative to the baseline, and I could not find absolute numbers for the baseline anywhere. Thus I am lead to believe that the results are for the smaller model, which likely performs worse than the original MTR? If this is true, I believe the authors need to release the absolute performance of their baseline.\nThe reason that the absolute performance is important to me is that its unclear whether the gains of the kinematic model hold when absolute performance increases as you scale the model, etc."

However, we believe that state-of-the-art models should also consider models with smaller numbers of trainable parameters for the sake of *practicality and portability*. While the benefit of kinematic priors diminish with greater model sizes, we believe that they will be beneficial in the event that such models need to be downscaled and fit onto a robot. \n\nWe hope this answers some of your questions, and thank you again for the feedback!"

As such, the main contribution of the work, as stated by the authors, lacks novelty.\nPlease find detailed comments below:\n- \"but also scales well in size\", unclear if this is a good or a bad thing. The authors should clarify this better.\n- The authors need to cite the earlier work listed above, and put their work into context. This is the biggest issue with the current manuscript and makes the work not ready for publication until this is done (since the level of contributions of the work is questionable).\n- Figures 1 and 2 are not referenced in the text.\n- Notation can be improved. E.g., in the equation for L  in Section 4.1 the notation p_h is not introduced before being used. The authors should make sure that all notation is properly defined.\n- \"we downscale the model\", how exactly? Unclear.\n- The authors do not properly explain the experiments, such as the number of mixture components used and other information relevant to understanding the approach and the experiments.\n- For the experiments with noisy trajectories, do you add noise during training as well? Unclear, would be good to clarify.\n- The experiments are somewhat dry, would be good to add some visual results as well."

Writing updates will be directly revised in the paper, and we will be sure to add visual results as well. \n\n- \u201cbut also scales well in size\u201d; is this a good thing or bad thing? \n\nWe mention this as a good thing in the context of performance, but also a bad thing in the context of portable autonomous driving models for real-time inference. We observe trends in recent years that SOTA models tend to become larger and larger\u2013combining SOTA from several tasks together for full-stack autonomous driving may prove to be computationally costly if model sizes continue to scale along with performance. We would like to motivate work in the direction of smaller models with more hand crafted kinematic modeling or classical simulation techniques for sake of *portability* or unseen domain situations with data scarcity (while still preserving performance).\n\nWe will clarify this confusion in future revisions of the paper.\n\n\n- \u201cwe downscale the model\u201d how? \n\nSince MTR is a transformer-based model, we downscale the model directly by reducing the number of heads, number of encoder and decoder layers, and hidden features. The full details on model parameters used for results can be found in Table 8 of the appendix. We will reference this Table in the revision.\n\n\n- \u201cFor the experiments with noisy trajectories, do you add noise during training as well?\u201d\n\nFor experiments regarding noisy trajectories, we do not add noise during training. The experiments were inspired by the scenario where training data is clean and well-processed, but sensors may be noisy in the real world. This experiment examined the robustness of our model in comparison to direct prediction on positional waypoint trajectories. \n\nWe hope these answers help clarify your questions, and again, thank you for the helpful and detailed feedback!"
