                    "value": "This paper introduces a metric called Meta-Distribution Energy (MDE) for automated model evaluation (assessing model performance on unlabeled datasets). The method involves extracting energy scores from the model's output and extending them into a statistical representation at the dataset level. The paper demonstrates a strong linear relationship between MDE and classification accuracy on datasets with differing extents of distribution shifts. This allows for predicting model performance based on the MDE of an unlabeled test set, and the authors provide theoretical proof of this concept. In the experimental section, the paper presents the outstanding performance of MDE across different backbones, datasets, and modalities, even in scenarios with noise and class imbalance."

It can help avoid the issue of not knowing the actual performance in practical applications and is also beneficial for model selection.\"\n2) The method MDE in the paper exhibits a relatively high level of novelty by introducing the statistical distribution of energy scores into the field of AutoEval for the first time. Furthermore, the paper extends the approach to improving energy scores, which can be applied to a wider range of tasks. Additionally, the authors provide detailed theoretical proof that strongly illustrates the effectiveness of the method.\n3) The paper conducts extensive experiments on different backbones, different datasets, and different modalities. The experimental results indicate a significant performance improvement compared to other methods in the field.\n4) The paper is of high writing quality, with a smooth and easy-to-grasp presentation of the key points."

Is T just an ordinary parameter, or does it have a more intuitive meaning? In Figure 3(a), only the trend of T from 1 to 10 is displayed. What is the impact of a wider range of T values on the results?\n2) In the paper, the authors categorized relevant methods into 'training-free' and 'training-must.' How much progress does MDE, as a 'training-free' method, make compared to 'training-must' methods in terms of evaluation time and memory usage? It would be ideal to conduct an experiment to illustrate this."

Most importantly, we did **not rely on T to tune performance**.\n\n**W2: Lacking a comparison in terms of evaluation time and memory usage between MDE and the training-must method**\n\nHonestly speaking, it is inaccessible to fairly compare the running time and memory usage of different methods. \n\nBecause **the workflow of different methods are very different**, e.g. training model from scratch, fine-tuning model, calculating model feature, statistic dataset distribution, computing the disagreement of ensemble prediction, etc. \n\nIntuitively, it is easy to understand because the training-must method requires retraining the model, which can consume huge memory and require much more time, while MDE only requires computing values from the model logits. \n\nSo, we **simplify this problem** to **compare the time complexity and space complexity** of different methods in a rough granularity: \n\n1. **For time complexity**:\n\n    *AC = ANE < ATC < AvgEnergy = MDE(ours) = NuclearNorm < Frechet < ProjNorm(training-must) < AgreeScore(training-must)*\n\n2. **For space complexity**: \n\n    *training-free(AC, ANE, ATC, AvgEnergy, MDE(ours), NuclearNorm, Frechet) < training-must(ProjNorm, AgreeScore)*\n\nWe hope our response addresses your original questions. Please let us know if you have any other comments. We are eager to hear your feedback."

                    "value": "- *1. Overstated claims*: The paper asserts that \"the AutoEval frameworks still suffer from an overconfidence issue\" without providing clear, empirical examples. Additionally, the statement regarding \"substantial storage\" lacks a comparison with existing methods such as DoC and ATC, leaving the reader unconvinced of any real advantage of the proposed method. Furthermore, the claim that the proposed MDE method is superior in terms of \"computational cost\" is not substantiated, especially considering that unlike ATC, MDE requires the training of a linear regression model. To move forward, it would be essential to clarify these issues with specific data and comparative analysis.\n\n- *2. Limited contribution*: The novelty of your work is questioned due to the similarity with existing methods in the field. The use of Energy score as a replacement for Softmax score, without significant insights or enhancements, is seen as insufficient for constituting a substantial contribution. Prior works [Detecting Errors and Estimating Accuracy on Unlabeled Data with Self-training Ensembles] have already discussed the connection between OOD detection and AutoEval, which the current submission does not appear to extend beyond.\n\n- *3. Unconvincing theoretical analysis*: The theoretical grounding provided in Section 3.3 is deemed unclear and unconvincing. The methodology for ascertaining model accuracy needs to account for scenarios where an image is correctly classified with a low Softmax score. A more robust theoretical framework is necessary to support the claims made.\n\n- *4. Experimental results are not solid*: The absence of results for ImageNet-1K in Table 1, along with other test datasets like ImageNet-S/A/V2, raises concerns about the comprehensiveness of the experimental evaluation. Moreover, the omission of recent relevant works, such as \"Characterizing Out-of-Distribution Error via Optimal Transport,\" and the lack of comparison with methods like Nuclear Norm on ImageNet setup, call into question the thoroughness of the analysis.\n\n- *5. Limited Dataset Diversity*: The paper does not report on more natural shifts, which are included in benchmarks provided by methods like ATC. While BREEDs are mentioned in the supplementary material, results are not presented, and expectations for insights on datasets like i-WILDS are not met."

                        "value": "We would like to thank you for your constructive comments, which are very helpful and make our paper even stronger! We sincerely hope that our response addresses your concerns.\n\n**W1&Q1: Please clarify the claims on the overconfidence issue, substantial storage, and computation cost**\n\nWe would like to give a clearer clarification of the advantages of MDE compared to existing AutoEval methods from three aspects:\n\n**i. Overconfidence issue:**\n\nFor methods based on model confidence, such as ConfScore, Entropy, DoC [1], and ATC, we provide an intuitive example to illustrate why they suffer from overconfidence issues.\n\nGiven two samples with labels [0, 1, 0] and [0, 1, 0], a model outputs softmax scores for the two samples such as [0.8, 0.1, 0.1] and [0.1, 0.8, 0.1].\nAt this point, the model's confidence is 80%, while the prediction accuracy is 50%, and the MAE between the two quantities is 30%. The model overestimates the prediction truthiness of its softmax probability, i.e., \"overconfidence\u201d.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to introduce model calibration techniques. We adopt commonly used temperature scaling (i.e. dividing logits by the coefficient $t$ before applying Softmax) in the ATC paper for demonstration:\n\nLet $t$ =2, the two softmax scores will be transformed to [0.4, 0.05, 0.05] and [0.05, 0.4, 0.05]. Now the model's Softmax confidence is 40%, while the prediction accuracy remains at 50%, the MAE will decrease by 20% for accuracy prediction.\n\nHowever, MDE is a meta-distribution statistical metric based on the sample\u2019s energy (a non-normalized scalar), which does not depend on Softmax confidence and thus is not affected by overconfidence.\n\n**ii. Substantial storage and Computation cost:**\n\n1. For methods based on prediction disagreement, such as self-training ensembles [2]; and AgreeScore, they generally use the disagreement of the prediction outputs of two or even multiple models for accuracy predictions. They **additionally train or fine-tune models and store these models**, which incurs additional storage and computing overhead.\n2. For methods based on model parameters, such as ProjNorm, first use the model to label the target data, then fine-tune the model on the pseudo data and finally calculate the model parameter shift to predict accuracy, while Weights [3] and Norm-based metrics [4] estimate the accuracy through the norm of the model weight matrix and bias vector. These methods **either fine-tune the model or use model parameters to calculate**, which is quite a bit of storage burden and computational cost.\n3. For methods based on self-supervised tasks, such as Rotation [5] and CAME [6], they jointly train the model from scratch by self-supervised task together with the classification task, and use the self-supervised accuracy as a proxy for classification accuracy. This way of **retraining the model** inevitably introduces extra computational overhead.\n4. For methods based on dataset distribution shift, such as Frechet and Bag-of-prototypes [7], when predicting the model accuracy of the target dataset, they need to **access the training set, obtain model features, and calculate the mean of feature or cluster the features**, this sort of method also consumes computing resources in practice.\n\nHowever, MDE only requires the model logits on the target dataset for calculation, without the above highlighted constraints. This effectively reduces the substantial storage and computation cost.\n\n**iii. Compared with ATC, MDE requires training a linear regression model**\n\n1. The buildup of **fitting regression models** via strong correlations between unsupervised indicator and accuracy, which **is just a common workflow** for several published AutoEval works ([4], [5], ProjNorm, Nuclear Norm, Frechet, Bag-of-prototypes, etc), no exclusive to MDE. In practice, we only call the `sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression`to fit the regression model, which is almost not time-consuming.\n2. The ATC method requires identifying a threshold on the source validation data and performing model calibration to obtain better accuracy predictions, it also has its own computational overhead.\n3. Most importantly, **the performance of MDE significantly surpasses ATC**. Compared with ATC, the mean absolute error of MDE dropped a lot (CIFAR-10: 8.15\u21921.78, TinyImageNet: 11.37\u21922.15, ImageNet: 11.51\u21925.48, MNLI: 15.77->5.76, Wilds: 6.35\u21922.26), the correlation also improves especially for MNLI ($\\rho$: 0.647\u21920.850, $R^2$: 0.459\u21920.680)."

The use of Energy score as a replacement for Softmax score\uff1a**\n\n1. **_MDE and Softmax score are different in essence and usage._** \n    \n- *Essence*: MDE is defined as the meta-distribution statistic of non-normalized energy at the dataset level, while Softmax score is the maximum value of the normalized logit vector for a single sample.\n    \n- *Usage*: Softmax score typically reflects the classification accuracy through measures such as the mean, mean difference, or the data proportion below a certain threshold. On the other hand, MDE predicts accuracy by a regression model.\n    \n2. **_MDE and Softmax score have different mathematical forms._**\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{MDE}(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\operatorname{Softmax} E(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\frac{e^{E\\left(x_n;f\\right)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^N e^{E\\left(x_i;f\\right)}}, \n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\max _y p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x})=\\max _y \\frac{e^{f_y(\\mathbf{x})}}{\\sum_i e^{f_i(\\mathbf{x})}}=\\frac{e^{f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})}}{\\sum_i e^{f_i(\\mathbf{x})}}\n\\end{equation}\n\n3. **_MDE is more suitable for accuracy prediction than Softmax score_** \n\n    To demonstrate this, we decompose the softmax confidence by logarithmizing it as follows:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\log \\max _y p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x}) & =E\\left(\\mathbf{x} ; f(\\mathbf{x})-f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    & =E(\\mathbf{x} ; f)+f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\n\n     Then, we find $f^{max}(x)$ tends to be lower and $E(x; f)$ tends to be higher for OOD data, and vice versa. This shifting results in Softmax confidence that is no longer suitable for accuracy prediction, while MDE is not affected by this bothersome issue.\n\n**ii. Existing work has discussed the connection between OOD detection and AutoEval, and this paper does not extend this scope.**\n    \n1. This paper **does not explore the relationship** between OOD detection and AutoEval but rather proposes **a novel AutoEval method**.\n    \n2. AutoEval has fundamental differences with OOD detection. OOD detection is to **identify outlier test samples** that are different from training distributions, but AutoEval is towards **unsupervised estimating of the model\u2019s testing accuracy.**\n    \n**iii. Reviewers *Dsfd* and *2CiW*** both **agree** that the MDE method has **theoretical interpretability and practical application effectiveness**. **Reviewer 2CiW** also **acknowledged the relatively high novelty** of the MDE method.\n\n**W3: Unconvincing theoretical analysis**\n\nWe respectfully disagree with this comment. \nConsidering **the scenario** mentioned by the reviewer where **the model accurately classifies images with lower softmax scores**, we provide the following example to illustrate how the Eq.(9) of Theorem 3.1 substantiates the MDE can work in such a case.\n\\begin{align}\n\\Delta^{i}=\\mathcal{MDE}^i - \\mathcal{L}^i_{\\text {nll }}\n= f_{y_i}({x_i})/T - \\max _{j \\in \\mathcal{Y}}{f_j\\left(x_i\\right)/T} =\\begin{cases}0, & \\text { if } j=y_i, \\\\\\\\\n<0, & \\text { if } j \\neq y_i,\\end{cases},   \\quad\\quad(9)\n\\end{align}\n\nGiven a sample with the label [0, 1, 0],  the model outputs the Softmax score for this sample as [0.4, 0.5, 0.1].\nAccording to Theorem 3.1, we know that $y_i$ =2, $j$ corresponding to $\\max _{j \\in \\mathcal{Y}}{f_j\\left(x_i\\right)/T}$  is 2, so the model classifies correctly with a lower softmax score.\n\nIn turn, **when the model incorrectly classifies images with higher softmax scores**, that is given a sample with the label [0, 1, 0], the model outputs the Softmax score for this sample as [0.5, 0.4, 0.1].\nAccording to Theorem 3.1, $y_i$ is still 2, but $j$ becomes 1, so $j$ is not equal to $y_i$, and $f_{y_i}\\left(x_i\\right) / T-\\max _{j \\in \\mathcal{Y}} f_j\\left(x_i\\right) / T = 0.4 - 0.5 $ < 0.\n\nFrom the above examples, by judging whether the term of Eq. 9 is less than 0, we can know whether the index $j$ belongs to the maximum logits equal to the label $y$, and then we can obtain the accuracy of the\nclassifier $f$. Thus, we mathematically establish a connection between MDE and classification risk.\n\nMoreover, both **Reviewers *Dsfd* and *2CiW* concurred** that **the theoretical proof** of this paper **has substantiated the effectiveness** of the proposed method."

The COT method **requires pre-calibration** of the classifier, which is not a constraint in MDE.\n\n1. The COT paper was **accepted** in Neurips 2023 **on October 27,** while the **submission deadline** for ICLR 2024 is on **September 28**. According to the paper submission principles, this is a paper of the same period and does not require comparison.\n2. To make the experiment more convincing, we **fairly compared MDE and COT** under the same experimental setting. It can be seen that without calibrating the classifier, the performance of **MDE is significantly better than COT**.\n3. Within such a short rebuttal period, we do not wish to engage in a dispute over which one is better. Considering that MDE and COT belong to **different technical systems** and do **not have an incremental innovation relationship**, our innovation lies in the domain of energy score systems.\n\n**W5: Limited Dataset Diversity**\n\nWe follow the reviewer's recommendation to report the result on the **Wilds datasets with more natural shifts**, the experimental setting kept the same as the ATC paper:\n\n**Table 3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE) comparison with existing methods on Wilds Setup**                                                                                                                                         \n\n| Dataset | Shift | ConfScore | Entropy | Frechet | ATC | COT | NuclearNorm | AvgEnergy | MDE |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Camelyon17 | Natural Shift | 9.01 | 8.19 | 8.49 | 7.46 | 5.31 | 4.26 | 3.21 | **2.93** |\n| RxRx1 | Natural Shift | 6.63 | 6.32 | 5.49 | 5.45 | 4.45 | 3.67 | 2.86 | **1.62** |\n| FMoW | Natural Shift | 10.52 | 9.61 | 7.47 | 6.13 | 5.26 | 4.49 | 2.90 | **2.24** |\n\n**The MAE of MDE** in predicting OOD test accuracy **on various Wilds datasets is optimal** again. \n\nBy the way, the Breeds dataset is created by more finely stratifying the class structure of ImageNet. Since we have completed the experiment on ImageNet, we have not reported on the Breeds dataset."

                        "value": "We would like to thanks for your valuable feedback and far-sighted insights. We hope the following statements will provide you gain an in-depth understanding of AutoEval and our MDE method, thereby dispelling your concerns. \n\n**Q1:  A clear restatement of AutoEval Problem**\n\n**i. What is AutoEval?**\n\nAutoEval task is to evaluate the performance of a trained model on datasets without accessing the real labels.\n\nSpecifically, given a trained model $f$ and an unlabeled OOD dataset $D_u=\\lbrace x_i \\rbrace_{i=1}^N$  with $N$ samples, AutoEval aims to predict the accuracy of $f$ on $D_u$.\n\nThe common AutoEval workflow is to develop an indicator that is correlated to accuracy but to calculate without requiring labels.\n\nThe AutoEval method is assessed by the correlation coefficient between the indicator and the accuracy, as well as the MAE between the predicted accuracy and ground-truth accuracy on OOD datasets.\n\n **ii. Why is AutoEval needed?**\n\n1. The AutoEval task is long-standing and has been studied in a wide range of areas, e.g. text classification [1], structured data [2], active learning [3], database [4], medicine images [5], self-driving images [6], AIGC [7], LLM [9,9], etc. \n\n2. The statistics for these AutoEval papers appearing in the top-tier publications: **Nature Communications**(1, [10]),  ICML(9), NeurIPS(6), ICLR(4), JMLR(2), AISTATS(1), CVPR(4, including the **CVPR2020 best paper nominations** [11]), ICCV(2), ACL(1), EMNLP(2), ECAL(1), SIGMOD(1), ICSE(1), TNNLS(1), a total of **36** paper.\n\n3. Also, **reviewers *Dsfd* and *2CiW* both agreed** in Strengths 1 of their reviews that **AutoEval is valuable** in the real-world deployment of DNNs.\n\n**Q2: How does AutoEval differ from uncertainty estimation?** \n\n  Unlike uncertainty estimation to estimate the confidence of model predictions to convey information about when a model\u2019s output should (or should not) be trusted, AutoEval directly predicts the accuracy of model output.\n\n  In this regard, AutoEval is a task that assesses the effectiveness and deployment worthiness of a model by directly predicting its accuracy in a testing environment.\n\n**Q3: Unlike common methods in uncertainty estimation, MDE is not an incremental approach.**\n\n**i. Using logits is a general operation:**\n  \nNotably, AutoEval methods based on model outputs (e.g. ConfScore [12], Entropy [13], ATC [14], NuclearNorm [15], etc.) all utilize logit, because it is closely associated with model accuracy. \n\nSo MDE just adopted this conventional practice and has achieved remarkable performance.\n\n**ii. MDE are totally different from common methods in uncertainty estimation**\n\nSince the reviewer did not clarify whether MDE is similar to which methods in uncertainty estimation, we compare MDE with the widely used Softmax confidence:\n\n  1. Comparing the essence of the two methods, MDE is the meta-distribution statistic of non-normalized energy at the dataset level, while Softmax confidence is the maximum value of the normalized logit vector for a single sample.\n\n2. Comparing the mathematical form of the two methods, they are completely different:\n\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{MDE}(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\operatorname{Softmax} E(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \n    \\frac{e^{E\\left(x_n;f\\right)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^N e^{E\\left(x_i;f\\right)}}, \n    \\end{equation}\n\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\max _y p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x})=\\max _y \\frac{e^{f_y(\\mathbf{x})}}{\\sum_i e^{f_i(\\mathbf{x})}}=\\frac{e^{f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})}}{\\sum_i e^{f_i(\\mathbf{x})}}\n    \\end{equation}\n\n3. Compare the two methods for accuracy prediction on OOD data, we decompose the softmax confidence by logarithmizing it as follows:\n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    \\log \\max _y p(y \\mid \\mathbf{x}) & =E\\left(\\mathbf{x} ; f(\\mathbf{x})-f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})\\right) \\\\\\\\\n    & =E(\\mathbf{x} ; f)+f^{\\max }(\\mathbf{x})\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\n\n    Then, we find $f^{max}(x)$ tends to be lower and $E(x; f)$ tends to be higher for OOD data, and vice versa. This shifting results in Softmax confidence that is no longer suitable for accuracy prediction, while MDE is not affected by this bothersome issue.\n\n**iii. Reviewer *2CiW* also acknowledged the relatively high novelty of the MDE method** in Strengths 2 of his/her review."

I cannot see a clear relationship between the proposed method and the energy-based model except that \"energy\" specifies the logits from the classification model. \n4. The performance of the proposed framework relies on the regression between MDE on the synthesized dataset and its accuracy. However, the type of domain shift is more complicated in the real world in most cases, thus very unpredictable. \n5. The experiment on adjusting temperature T should be conducted on a broader range, like from 0.01 to 100. The change from 1 to 10 is relatively small.\n6. A real dataset for evaluation needs to be included. The operation of shear, equalization, and color temperature adjustment is easy to synthesize, while the domain shift could come from more complex sources like [1][2].\n7. Some missing EBM references can be considered to be included into this paragraph to make it more complete for the readers. For example, [3] is the first EBM using CNN for energy function and trains it with Langevin dynamics. [3] is also the first one to point out that EBM and a classifier can be derived from each other.

We sincerely hope our response can resolve your concerns.\n\n**W3: Unclear relationship between MDE and EBM.**\n\nA standard Energy-Based Model (EBM) is trained with implicit MCMC sampling [1,2] to learn an energy function that assigns low energy values to input x in the sampled data distribution. \n\n**The proposed MDE is not an EBM**, but an indicator calculated with resort to the energy function of EBM. Importantly, the MDE indicator can predict the model performance on unlabeled OOD datasets in real-world scenarios, achieving the SOTA benchmark without requiring much extra overhead. \n\nIn the original paper, we first introduce that the classifier can be regarded as an EBM (Eq.1~Eq. 3), and then we calculate the MDE indicator through the \"energy\" of all data points. (Eq.4). \n\nThat is the relationship between MDE and EBM.\n\n**W4&W6: Transformations such as shear etc. is easy to synthesize, and requires more complicated real dataset for evaluation**\n\nAs suggested by the reviewer, to substantiate the feasibility of MDE in the wild, we **compare MDE with other strong baselines on the more complicated real datasets \u2014 ImageNet and Wilds,** where Wilds includes the MRI-like medical image dataset Camelyon17.\n\n**Table 1.

Most importantly, we did **not rely on T to tune performance**.\n\n**W1&W2&W7: Non-standard symbol format and missing EBM citations.**\n\nThanks for the reminders! We will complete these symbols and references.\n\n**Q1: A clerical error about MDE.**\n\nSorry, we missed a summation sign after the $-\\frac{1}{|N|}$ please excuse this clerical error.\n\nEq.(5) is an expectation term\uff1a$\\mathcal{MDE}(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\operatorname{Softmax} E(x;f) =-\\frac{1}{|N|} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\log \\frac{e^{E\\left(x_n;f\\right)}}{\\sum_{i=1}^N e^{E\\left(x_i;f\\right)}}.$\n\n**Q2&Q4: How to generate the synthesized set for regression and evaluate correlation in Table 1?**\n\nWe take the **CIFAR-10 setup** as an example to clarify this doubt. At this setup, **the synthetic set is CIFAR-10-C datasets**, which involve 19 types of corruption with 5 different intensity levels applied to the CIFAR-10 validation set. \nWhen **encountering a new data setup**, we can perform **the same corruption operation on its validation set** to obtain the synthetic set. \n**The correlation score** of each dataset in Table 1 refers to **the coefficients $\\rho$,  $R^2$ calculated on the <MDE, accuracy> pair** of its corresponding **synthesized set**. \n\n**Q3: How to correct performance drop on new datasets\uff1f**\n\n- **_If the reviewer wants to know \u201chow to mitigate the MAE and correlation degradation of the MDE method on OOD datasets\u201d_**:\n\n    **All AutoEval methods may suffer from performance degradation on unknown new datasets**, and this is not exclusive to MDE alone.\n\n    This performance decline typically arises from severe domain shifts between the new dataset and the training dataset, such as adversarial perturbations and extreme class imbalances.\n    Faced with these challenging scenes, how to sample the new dataset to capture its main shift types and combine it into the synthetic set may be a promising solution. \n    We sincerely request the community to actively involve themselves in addressing this issue.\n\n- **_If the reviewer wants to know \u201chow to alleviate the accuracy decline of models on OOD datasets\u201d_**:\n\n    Once MDE finds that the model performance drops significantly on the new dataset, we can introduce related **technologies of domain adaptation or domain generalization** to alleviate this problem, but this is not the scope of this article.\n\n**Q6: Comparing the performance of different regression models.**\n\nThe choice of different regression models **does not affect the accuracy prediction performance**. With a fixed dataset (CIFAR-10) and backbone (VGG11), we compare the correlation and MAE results between RobustLinearRegression and LinearRegression below:\n\n|  | RobustLinearRegression | LinearRegression |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  $\\rho$ | 0.991 | 0.991 |\n| $r$ | 0.987 | 0.987 |\n| $r^2$ | 0.973 | 0.974 |\n| MAE | 1.80 | 1.78 |"

For instance, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, we evaluate the correlation on the CIFAR-10-C synthetic domain-shifted dataset and calculate the MAE on natural domain-shifted datasets such as CINIC-10, etc.\n\nNotably, the MDE method does not require access to the real labels when predicting the model accuracy on domain-shift data. \nIf we understand the reviewer right, we do need the real labels to provide real accuracy when evaluating the MAE of the MDE method."
