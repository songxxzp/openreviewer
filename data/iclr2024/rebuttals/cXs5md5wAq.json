The authors introduce a novel approach by modeling bacterial communities using graph neural networks (GNNs) directly from the genomes of the bacteria. The inherent properties of GNNs, such as permutation invariance, allow them to effectively capture the relationships within the bacterial set, thus offering combinatorial generalization."

Since graphsage is only one instantiation and there are many recent ones with more expressive powers. \n\nModeling the dynamics sounds interesting. Could the authors also use GNN in an iterative way to model the dynamics? For example, using ideas from this paper: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/sanchez-gonzalez20a.html"

                        "value": "Thank you for your positive evaluation of our work and feedback.\n\n**Fig3A** \nThey are now shown as the average performance of the ensemble model across the 5 cross-validation sets is shown together with the 95% confidence interval. We have homogenized the figures now to show the average and the 95% confidence interval.\n\n**Combinations**\nWe have now included the MLP architecture in all experiments for more homogeneity in the manuscript, we hope this clarifies the reviewer's concern.\n\n**Other architectures**\nAs per the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have now tested the improved graph attention architecture (GATv2) [1] (original version GAT in [2]), and the improved graph convolution from [3] (GCNII), (original version GCN in [4]). Unfortunately, they failed to fit the Friedman2017data (see Table below). We added results in Appendix A and Supplementary Table S3.\n\n**Table:** Accuracy of models implemented with the GATv2 [2] and GCNII [4] architectures on real microbial community data. For each dataset, five seeds per model were used and models fitted on five cross-validation folds. The average coefficient of determination ($R^2$) of the ensemble models, with a 95% confidence interval, was calculated on 100 bootstraps of test samples.\n\n| Dataset | Architecture | Test average $R^2$ | 95 % confidence interval |\n|-----------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Friedman2017 | GCNII | 0.0618 | [-0.1410, 0.2822] |\n| Friedman2017 | GATv2 | 0.0279 | [-0.0808, 0.1266] |\n| Friedman2017 | MPGNN | 0.808809  | [0.677719, 0.894381] |\n| BaranwalClark2022 | GCNII | 0.7090 | [0.5498, 0.827654] |\n| BaranwalClark2022 | GATv2 | 0.3568 | [0.2455, 0.4711] | \n| BaranwalClark2022 | MPGNN | 0.762534 | [0.665613, 0.844525] |\n\nThese architectures do not seem to be particularly suitable for our task, as even with hyperparameter optimization, we could not get good performances on both datasets.\n\n**Dynamics**\n\nWe agree that explicitly predicting growth dynamics may be ideal for apprehending bacterial community assembly and interactions. In practice, the GNN models we propose can be repurposed for this task, and densely predict the state of the community at arbitrary timesteps. It is also possible to enhance the model by using e.g. recurrent GNN. A challenge is that datasets usually contain one time point per sample due to time and resource costs. Therefore, while this approach would be possible for a few datasets, e.g., as in [5-6], it could not be extended to more.\n\n----\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Brody, Shaked, Uri Alon, and Eran Yahav. \"How attentive are graph attention networks?.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.14491 (2021).\n\n[2] Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Petar, et al. \"Graph attention networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1710.10903 (2017).\n\n[3] Chen, Ming, et al. \"Simple and deep graph convolutional networks.\" International conference on machine learning.

Using GNN/MPGNN the authors were able to model but the models were sensitive to variations and generalizing to larger systems was poor. Models were better than MLP but only marginally."

                    "value": "While I enjoyed reading something on the outskirts of my experience, although I have grown my own tuberculosis communities in the early days of my research, I struggle with some of the basic premises:\n* Motivation & Context: The paper's motivation needs clearer alignment with real-world applications. The authors cite that understanding these communities is essential for gut, industry and space but I find the step from this paper to extrapolating to gut seems huge. The largest studied communities are 26 and this needs to be put in context with the other fields, citing Wikipedia \u201c1010 to 1011 cells per gram of intestinal content\u201d seems far off from the estimated single colonies. The types of bacteria should also be matched with the environment that you aim to generalize for.\n* Sample Size & DNA Inclusion: I'm concerned about the limited independent samples, especially in combination with the attempt to include DNA. Making sense of DNA has proven much more difficult than thought of in the beginning and I\u2019m not convinced that the addition made sense. Adding it to the paper risks of overfitting the data even more. I wonder if the field wouldn\u2019t benefit more from going from 500 samples to 1-2000 more than this paper. My experience with building models on this type of data is that they are frustratingly brittle due to the lack of data.\n* Clarity & Explanation: Coming from medicin to ML is always a challenge. It would be helpful if the paper could provide clearer explanations for terms and metrics, especially for readers transitioning from medical backgrounds. E.g. keystone bacteria are not explained, good vs acceptable R2 is unclear to the reader (I can\u2019t even find clearly how is this calculated, despite looking in appendix A which I should not have to for the main outcome), I assume that R2 is highly dependent on the underlying complexity, also the datasets have completely different bacteria suggesting that their purpose was different but this is unclear to me despite reading it several times.\n* Simulation Impact: The paper should provide a clearer explanation of the effect of simulated colonies on the models' stability.\nRegarding the conclusion I\u2019m a little confused as to why it doesn\u2019t recommend including more data. I believe the authors have devoted significant time to this paper and before we put others down this path, perhaps we should wait for more data or do the authors truly feel that GEMs will be the solution?"

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your feedback. Hopefully, this work will also be useful to investigate microbial communities within which *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* grows! \n\n**Motivation & Context**\nWe refer the reviewer to the common response: we have added an experiment on simulated data to evaluate the scalability of the method. Regarding the type of bacteria and environment, we do not aim for particular microbiota: Friedman2017 showcases soil bacteria and BaranwalClark2022, gut bacteria. In general, our framework could be applied to any microbiota.\n\n**Sample Size & DNA Inclusion**\nHere, the inclusion of DNA allows us to generalize by its universality, as we treat it as a global feature space. It is the only set of features we learn from and, as shown in the results, enables predicting unseen bacteria to a certain extent. \n\nWe agree that the lack of data entails good performance, as shown in the new experiments in Appendix B and Supplementary Fig. S9. Our new results clearly highlight that, especially for large, complex communities, models benefit from more samples at training time. They also demonstrate that our approach can scale to large communities of up to 200 bacteria. Finally, we also show in Appendix B and Supplementary Fig. S10, that given a large number of samples, GNNs\u2019 performance on unseen bacteria increases with the diversity of bacteria seen during training. Hence, we believe our method will become increasingly useful with larger-scale datasets.\n\n**Clarity & Explanation**\n- $R^2$: We have now detailed $R^2$ in the Methods of the main text. $R^2$ measures the deviation from a given model to a random one that would predict an average value. Hence, it is independent of the underlying complexity. \n- Datasets: please, see the common response.\n- Keystone bacteria: we have changed the wording in the text. A keystone bacterium is a bacterium that drives community assembly; they are identified from data showing that their presence or removal dramatically affects the community composition [1].\n\n**Simulation Impact & Question**\n\n- Firstly, we have improved clarity on the fact that models were fitted to datasets independently -- please, see the common response. \n\n- The simulations are intended to study the properties of the prediction pipeline. We have now developed this further by investigating scaling and diversity aspects. We added this to Appendix B and discussed it in Section 3.4; see also answer to **Sample Size & DNA Inclusion.**\n\n- We do not intend to suggest that more data is not beneficial: our experiments on simulated data show an increase in model accuracy when trained on more communities sampled from a given set of bacterial species, as discussed in Appendix B.1 and shown in Supplementary Fig. S9. In this particular setting, we observe that accuracy plateaus once a sufficient number of communities is observed. \nGiven the jump in complexity of communities when increasing community sizes (in this case the number of bacteria species in the network), we see an overall decrease in performance as overfitting with smaller communities and lower generalization for larger ones is observed.\nWhen it comes to generalizing to unseen bacteria, we also argue that increasing the number of samples improves predictions to a certain extent but is limited. However, increasing the diversity of bacteria seen during training enables further improving the accuracy as shown in Supplementary Fig. S10.\n\n- Our opinion is that we, as bioinformaticians and computer scientists, should tackle biological challenges with the data that is currently available. While efforts are made in the lab to enhance datasets with high-throughput methods (e.g., sample miniaturization and automation of data acquisition), we make progress on the data analysis side. The datasets that will appear on this topic soon, will still not be big enough to satisfy large-scale deep learning machinery, so we believe our method is timely and at the right scale. \n\n----\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Banerjee, Samiran, Klaus Schlaeppi, and Marcel GA van der Heijden. \"Keystone taxa as drivers of microbiome structure and functioning.\" Nature Reviews Microbiology 16.9 (2018): 567-576."

                    "value": "1. The methodological contribution is limited as the presented work is mostly implementing GNNs for microbial steady state predictions. \n\n2. The main core of the paper is based on the assumption that if there is a steady state solution to the dynamics of bacterial species, then that steady state can be predicted using the genome data of the species in the system. This is a reasonable assumption to make. However the fact that this method works only for steady state solutions needs to be emphasized. Indeed in the GLV setting in the famous example of foxes and rabbits, there could be steady state and oscillatory solutions even though the participating genomes are foxes and rabbits in both the cases. It might also be a good idea to highlight why authors expect to find (or not) only steady state solutions in systems involving microorganisms such as bacteria. This will add more strength to the paper.\n\n3. For simulations, the GLV equations along with initial conditions and parameters $\\mu_i, K_i, a_{i,j}$ drawn from different probability density functions are used to generate data. Did all such simulations lead to steady state solutions? Were any simulations that did not lead to steady state solutions discarded? Do the authors also have any comments on the frequency of steady state solutions when random parameters are used?\n\n4. Given the GLV equations, the steady state solutions can be found by solving a system of $|S|$ linear algebraic equations:\n    \\begin{equation}\n        \\sum_{j=1}^{|S|}a_{i,j}n_j = K_i.\n    \\end{equation}\nThe steady state is entirely determined by the parameters $a_{i,j}$ and $K_i$. The authors use a vector composed of $[\\mu_i, K_i, \\nu_i^s, \\nu_i^r, random]$ (where $a_{i,j} \\approx \\nu_i^s. \\nu_j^r$) to simulate the genome data in their simulation. It would be a good idea to highlight that within the simulated genome vector only the components $[K_i, \\nu_i^s, \\nu_i^r]$ determine the steady state solution.\n\n5. The parameter $a_{i,j}$ (broken into two vectors $\\nu_i^s, \\nu_j^r$ to simulate the genome) contains information on the pairwise interaction between different species. On the other hand, the information in a genome is completely intrinsic to a particular species. The authors should square these two facts.\n\n6. A proper simulation would entail simulation of the genome data. The genome data typically do not include information on interaction between species. But for simulations, the interaction matrix was used to derive $\\nu$ vectors. The claim of interpretability seems to be questionable. \n    \n7. The authors appear to be confused on equivariance and invariance. The permutation invariance justification for using graph neural networks is confusing. For example, GLV models are widely used to model the dynamics of microorganisms. But the GLV model is not permutation invariant. The authors stated \"\\textit{When shuffling the order of bacteria within the train and test communities, the accuracy of MLPs drops significantly, clearly showing that the dynamics learned by MLPs are not invariant to permutations...}\" It is to be expected that shuffling the data will lead to reduction in performance of MLP based models. But as long as all the training and testing is done with a particular order of species, it should not matter.\n\n8. The authors need to provide details on how the node (genome) attributes were obtained, especially $\\nu$'s, as in real-world data, the ground-truth interaction $a_{ij}$ is not available."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for thoroughly evaluating our work, especially on the simulation section. Your comments are much appreciated and highlight points we must clarify in the manuscript. Below, we answer the weakness points (W#) and questions (Q#).\n\n**W1**\nThe vast majority of datasets consist of a unique time point per sample. Hence, there is a trade-off between waiting for more growth dynamics and utilizing the data we already have. While efforts are made in the lab to enhance datasets with high-throughput methods (e.g., sample miniaturization and automation of data acquisition), progress on the data analysis side may also be made to fit the data type better. We, as well, would prefer working with growth curves, but these datasets are simply too few and showcase too small communities. Hence, we propose an alternative to focus on steady states, with more datasets and applications. Also, microbiota can be hypothesized to be in pseudo-stable states, as they generally show low variability across time except for big environmental perturbations [1].   \n\n**W2-3**\nYou are entirely right: not all simulated communities necessarily lead to a steady state; we would discard suicidal and non-stable communities, i.e. keep communities if $\\sum_{i \\in |S|} n_i > 0$ and $\\frac{dn_i}{dt} < 10^{-3} \\; \\forall i \\in |S|$, with $|S|$ the number of bacteria in the community. In practice, for our set of parameters, all simulated communities were already stable, hence we did not need to resort to discarding any. This is now included in the Methods section 2.4. \n\nFinally, we do not expect to find only steady states in nature as multi-stability and environmental fluctuations may vary the observed states of communities [2]; this is a limitation of our current proposal. A potential improvement would be predicting each species' probability distribution (e.g., mean and variance of a Gaussian distribution) and/or predicting several values. Unfortunately, we could not implement these with our datasets due to the lack of samples to estimate variance and due to very few cases of multi-stability. \n\n**W4**\nWe updated the Methods accordingly.\n\n**W5-6**\nIn our simulations, the interaction matrix $M$ determines the evolution of the community. In principle, this matrix is an unknown function of the genome of different bacterial species. Therefore, while we can define an interesting distribution over interaction matrices, it is extremely challenging to define a distribution over genomes such that this gives rise to a reasonable distribution of interaction matrices. For this reason, we are forced to take an inverse approach to control $M$: we sample interaction matrices, assume a particular form for the function mapping genomes to interactions, and optimize the genome of simulated bacteria to produce the desired interaction matrix. This allows us to indirectly sample from a distribution of genomes such that a function from genomes to the interaction matrix is guaranteed to exist, and the resulting interaction matrix is interesting.\n\nWe carefully reviewed our manuscript and did not come across any mention of interpretability for the simulated genomes. Our suggestion for interpreting GNNs and genomes in future work pertains to real data. If there is any confusion, please point it out so we can make appropriate edits.\n\n**W7**\nThank you for pointing this out; we corrected **invariance** for **equivariance** in the manuscript.\n\n**W8, Q1** \nSee the common response; we clarified the Methods. We only use node attributes (the genomes) and, given the lack of prior knowledge on bacterial interactions, we do not use edge attributes and we use a fully connected graph. \n\n**Q2**\nSee the common response; we added experiments to quantify the scalability of our method, shown in Appendix B.1 and and S10. \nOur new results demonstrate that our approach can scale to large communities of up to 200 bacteria (Supplementary Fig. S9). \nWe also show that given a large number of samples, GNNs\u2019 performance on unseen bacteria increases with the diversity of bacteria seen during training Supplementary Fig. S10). Hence, we believe our method will become increasingly useful with larger-scale datasets.\n\n\n----\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Lozupone, Catherine A., et al. \"Diversity, stability and resilience of the human gut microbiota.\" Nature 489.7415 (2012): 220-230.\n\n[2] Gonze, Didier, et al. \"Multi-stability and the origin of microbial community types.\" The ISME journal 11.10 (2017): 2159-2166."

                        "value": "Thanks a lot for your time and feedback. We understand our motivation to use GNNs needs to be clarified and we would like to provide some first answers. \n\n\n- We employ GNNs as a predictive model for microbial systems. Note that this differs from some benchmarks in the GNN literature [1-2], where the goal is to perform e.g. node classification with large graphs with known connectivity as input data.\n\n- We are interested in using the GNN as a dynamics model, where we cannot assume any prior knowledge on the graph connectivity.  Our view of GNNs as dynamics models is similar to the works [3-5]. In all these cases, the graphs are small (3-10 nodes), but still, they benefit from the injection of relational and entity-centric inductive biases via the graph structure, as it offers isolation of information that monolithic networks don\u2019t have [6].\n\n- GNNs offer the advantage of sharing parameters across nodes - treating input genomes as a bag of units rather than 1 concatenated vector, which is key to generalizing to any unseen bacteria and communities of any size. Any new genome can thus be treated by the GNN for predictions without needing to resize the model. Whether the bacterial community is small or big is an external characteristic which does not influence the choice of architecture for this task. \n\n- As rightly pointed out, we do not know the graph topology. It is where GNNs become handy as we can use fully connected graphs that do not make any assumptions about the network. The message passing and/or convolutional layers allow updating nodes based on all members of the community, which is reasonable as all members may affect each other (directly or indirectly [7-8]). The k-hop information propagation should capture k-order relations between entities: the first message passing is limited to the neighboring node attributes (pairwise interactions) and the next ones propagate the interactions of neighbors (bacterium $n_i$ receives information from $n_j$ and how it has been affected by others). \n\n\nWe hope these points answer your concerns and that our motivation to use GNN is now more comprehensible; we will edit our manuscript accordingly. Besides, we will answer your 2nd question in the coming days.\n\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Sen, Prithviraj, et al. \"Collective classification in network data.\" AI magazine 29.3 (2008): 93-93.\n\n[2] Pei, Hongbin, et al. \"Geom-gcn: Geometric graph convolutional networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.05287 (2020).\n\n[3] Sanchez-Gonzalez, Alvaro, et al. \"Graph networks as learnable physics engines for inference and control.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

In addition, please check our general response.\n\n**Q1** \nPlease, see the 1st part of the response. \nWe modified a) our motivation to use GNNs in the Introduction, b) the description of the network topology in the Methods.\n\n**Q2** \nWe agree that predicting growth dynamics may be ideal for apprehending bacterial community assembly and interactions. However, in practice, datasets usually contain 1 time point per sample due to time and resource costs. Therefore, approaching the problem via steady-states allows a potential application to many more datasets and applications. \n\nRegarding modeling the dynamics, we argue that directly predicting the quantity of interest in an end-to-end fashion has proven generally more efficient than using intermediates in machine learning. Hence, while our framework could be employed for modeling dynamics recursively, e.g., as in [1-2], it may not necessarily be better.\n\nFinally, understanding dysbiosis events is essential for human health. As of note, dysbiosis is a disruption of the microbiota from a healthy state [3]. Accordingly, dysbiosis can be studied from steady-state data by comparing healthy and diseased samples and does not require a dynamic model.\n\n----\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Michel-Mata, Sebastian, et al. \"Predicting microbiome compositions from species assemblages through deep learning. iMeta 1: e3.\" (2022).\n\n[2] Baranwal, Mayank, et al. \"Recurrent neural networks enable design of multifunctional synthetic human gut microbiome dynamics.\" Elife 11 (2022): e73870.\n\n[3] Kriss, Michael, et al. \"Low diversity gut microbiota dysbiosis: drivers, functional implications and recovery.\" Current opinion in microbiology 44 (2018): 34-40."
