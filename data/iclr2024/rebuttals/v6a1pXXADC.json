                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for your time!\n\n> W1. The novelty is limited.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work exploring optimizing discrete prompts for in-context learning (ICL) in the adversarial learning style. We propose adv-ICL which can effectively optimize the prompts. Despite simplicity, our method shows strong improvements over the baselines and achieves significant improvements over previous approaches while requiring very few training data.\n\nThat being said, novelty itself is a subjective matter. The whole deep learning field is built on empirical results with old ideas. The whole GPT series had very limited \u201cnovelty\u201d in the traditional sense, except the prompting formulation. They just made it work. Our method also works. Papers like ours are the reason for why we have great AI technologies today.\n\n> W2: Add examples in the presentation.\n\nWe have updated an example in Figure 1 of the updated version. Please check it.\n\n> W4. The limitations are missing.\n\nThe limitation section is not required for ICLR. Please check the author guide (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide). \n\n> Q1. Why the discriminator is necessary?\n\nWe have conducted extra experiments supporting the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n- Froze discriminator: We have conducted our experiments with Vicuna and ChatGPT where we frozen the discriminators on four representative datasets: WebNLG, Machine translation (RO->EN), YELP, and GSM8K. The results with Vicuna and ChatGPT are shown below:\n\n| Model | WebNLG | Translation (RO->EN) | YELP | GSM8K |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |\n| Vicuna | 52.5 | 72.1 | 71.0 | 40.7 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL (Frozen discriminator) | 54.9 | 71.9 | 71.2 | 41.8 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL | 59.3 | 73.4 | 73.6 | 43.9 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| ChatGPT | 60.9 | 78.8 | 69.8 | 79.4 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL (Frozen discriminator) | 60.8 | 78.6 | 70.1 | 79.5 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL | 63.6 | 80.4 | 71.9 | 82.3 |\n\nIt is clear that updating the discriminator is essential in our formulation.\n\n> Q2. Why too many iterations T or samples m harm the performance\n\nThis is an interesting point! We observed this phenomenon in the experiments and were also curious about it. Our current hypothesis is that, while in-context learning holds great promise, it does not behave similar to SGD based learning. For example, having more demonstrations or data samples in the prompt does not help. Also, as demonstrated by [1], a critical threshold exists for the number of training examples, and surpassing this threshold leads to a decline in performance. As a result, more iterations or more samples do not necessarily help. \n\nGiven the complexity of in-context learning, we simply determine the best hyperparameters based on empirical results. We perform hyperparameter search based on the validation data of a small set of tasks. These hyperparameters do generalise to the other tasks. For details about the hyperparameter search process, you can refer to Section 2.4 in the original paper and Section 2.5 in the revised version. \n\n> Q3. Baseline in Figure 9 and Figure 10\n\nThe \u201cBaseline\u201d in Figures 9 and 10 are the Few-shot baseline.\n\n> Misc: Discuss with concurrent work LLM Optimizers.\n\nWe have included it in our related work discussion. The paper presents a novel LLMs optimizer that leverages feedback from LLMs to refine prompts effectively. This paper lies in the field of self-refinement and RL optimization m ethods, as explored in previous works [3] and [4]. However, our distinctive contribution lies in the study of adversarial in-context learning. We have included a discussion with the LLM optimizer in our related work. \n\n**References**\n\n[1] Min et al. Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context Learning Work?

Disregarded Prompts:\nDuring the iterative training process, when a new prompt is introduced to optimize the loss function, the model (either the generator or the discriminator) engages in in-context learning, regardless of whether the new prompt is accepted or discarded. It's worth noting that discarded prompts can also impact the model's training, but the paper does not explore this aspect in detail.\n\nW2-b. Unclear Origin of Benefits:\nThe observed performance improvements in the experiments may not be solely attributed to the accepted examples but could also be influenced by the discarded ones. Furthermore, given that the optimization process relies on the stochastic behavior of large language models, it's possible that the learning effect results from the repeated trial-and-error of prompt modifications occurring during the training iterations rather than from improved prompts. Therefore, the assumption that improvements in experimental results are solely due to adversarial training may not be valid."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for your time. We respectfully think that the reviewer did not understand our method. However, we will try to address your concerns as best as we can. \n\n> W1. The convergence of the proposed approach.\n\nIn the updated draft, we included a new theoretical analysis section that shows the proposed algorithm converges to the desired equilibrium under mild assumptions. \n\nHere is the sketch of the analysis. \n\n### **Theoretical Results**\nIn this section, we theoretically analyze whether such a minimax objective in the form of in-context learning can achieve the desired equilibrium as in the original GAN scenario. We assume access to models with infinite capacities powering the discriminator $D$, generator $G$, and prompt modifier $M$ and that in each iteration, we sample a sufficient number of prompts from $M$ to update both $G$ and $D$. Let $p_{data}$ be the distribution of the training data, and $p_g$ be of the generated data from $G$. \n\nConsidering a language model $\\mathcal{M}$ which can be $D$ or $G$ performing a corresponding task $T_1$ and evaluated by a metric $E_1$,  we further assume that:\n1. $M$ is powerful enough to modify the initial prompt of $\\mathcal{M}$ for $T_1$, covering all possible prompt variants performing the task $T_1$. \n2. $\\mathcal{M}$ is a powerful enough language model that there exists a prompt $\\mathcal{P}$ of $T$ for $\\mathcal{M}$ that given $\\mathcal{P}, \\mathcal{M}$ can achieve the globally optimal result on $E_1$ for the task $T$.\n3. There exists a prompt sampled by $M$ that maximizes $\\mathcal{M}$ on $E_1$ globally on $T$.\n\nThe assumption 3 is a result of the assumptions 1, and 2, and the assumption about our access to infinite capacities language models. Indeed, given $\\mathcal{M}$, from assumption 2, there exists a globally optimized prompt $\\mathcal{P}$ of $T_1$ for it such that it can achieve the globally optimal state on $E_1$ for the task $T_1$. Furthermore, since $M$ is powerful enough in modifying the initial prompt (ass. 1), plus $M$ samples a sufficiently large number of prompts for each iteration (ass. 2), $M$ can generate $\\mathcal{P}$ with a non-zero probability, which conclude the assumption 3.\n\nFrom the assumptions, we have the following propositions.\n\n**Proposition 1 (Goodfellow et al., 2014).** For G fixed, the optimal discriminator D can be described in a closed form, denoted as D*.\n\n**Proposition 2.** For each training iteration, for a fixed $G$, the optimal discriminator $D^*$ can be achieved.\n\n**Proposition 3 (Motivated by Goodfellow et al., 2014).** If $G$ and $D$ have enough capacity, and at each training step, the discriminator is allowed to reach its optimum $D^*$ given $G$, and $p_g$ is updated so as to improve the criterion \n\nThe proofs for the propositions are presented in *Appendix A.1* of our revised manual script. Our conclusion is that *with strong enough $D,G,M$, the framework adv-ICL converges*. \n\n> W2a. It's worth noting that discarded prompts can also impact the model's training \n\nWe respectfully think that the reviewer misunderstood our method. First, it is worth noting that our method does not require any update in the models\u2019 parameters, it only updates the prompts of the discriminator and generator. Second, we only forward the best-performing prompt from the previous training iteration to the next training iteration for modification, and it is reasonable for us to further optimize this best-performing prompt without considering the discarded ones.\n\n> W2b. Effect results may come from the repeated trial-and-error of prompt modifications\n\nIn addition to our arguments in W2a, we further conduct experiments to verify whether the prompt modifier module worked as expected. Specifically, we deactivate the discriminator and only employ a prompt modifier to repeatedly optimize the prompt. Our experimental results with Vicuna and ChatGPT are provided below:\n\n| Model | WebNLG | Translation (RO->EN) | YELP | GSM8K |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |\n| Vicuna | 52.5 | 72.1 | 71.0 | 40.7 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL w/o Discriminator | 50.1 | 71.4 | 72.1 | 40.2 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL | 59.3 | 73.4 | 73.6 | 43.9 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| ChatGPT | 60.9 | 78.8 | 69.8 | 79.4 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL w/o Discriminator | 61.2 | 77.4 | 64.5 | 71.6 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL | 63.6 | 80.4 | 71.9 | 82.3 |\n\nIn the majority of cases, when the discriminator is deactivated and only the prompt modifier is relied upon under Vicuna and ChatGPT, there is a noticeable decline in performance. This decline can be attributed to the inherent randomness of the prompt modifier, which lacks the ability to discern a more effective prompt. This observation underscores the substantial significance of the discriminator and adversarial loss in the optimization process."

Similar to traditional adversarial learning, there is a minimax game between the generator and the discriminator, where the generator aims to generate realistic text to fool the discriminator. The generator is provided with task instructions, several exemplars, and input at each round and produces the output; the discriminator then tries to decide whether the generator input-output pair is real data or model generated. After that, the prompt modifier makes changes to the generator, and the discriminator prompts to improve the adversarial loss. They perform a set of experiments using both open and closed-source models on various generation and classification tasks to evaluate their model."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for your time.\n\n> W1. Need to be compared with some more RL-based prompt optimization baselines.\n\nThese RL-based baselines could not be applied to the closed source models such as ChatGPT and text-davinci. To test the effectiveness of our method, we need to perform experiments on these models because they have better performance. This is why we made the decision to not compare with RL-based methods. Specifically, [1] and [2] require access to LLMs for inserting MLPs. \n\nWe compared adv-ICL with state-of-the-art prompt learning methods including GPS, APO and APE and outperformed them consistently, which indicates the effectiveness of our method. \n\n> Q1. What if we provide more feedback to the prompt modifier.\n\nWe conducted an experiment that involved integrating the most successful prompts from previous iterations as feedback for the next iteration. In this process, we utilized previous best-performing prompts, namely $P_1, P_2, ..., P_k$, as inputs to the prompt modifier module when generating the $(k+1)$-th prompt. \n\nWe applied the method to four representative tasks, including data-to-text generation task WebNLG, machine translation, sentiment classification Yelp, and reasoning GSM8k, using Vicuna and ChatGPT. The experimental results are shown below:\n\n| Model | WebNLG | Translation (RO->EN) | YELP | GSM8K |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |\n| Vicuna | 52.5 | 72.1 | 71.0 | 40.7 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL (prompt modifier with history) | 56.9 | 74.0 | 74.2 | 42.2 |\n| Vicuna with Adv-ICL | 59.3 | 73.4 | 73.6 | 43.9 |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| ChatGPT | 60.9 | 78.8 | 69.8 | 79.4 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL (prompt modifier with history) | 62.1 | 79.8 | 72.1 | 80.9 |\n| ChatGPT with Adv-ICL | 63.6 | 80.4 | 71.9 | 82.3 |\n\nIn the case of Vicuna, incorporating additional feedback into the prompt modifier proves effective for tasks such as translation and classification. However, this approach falls short when applied to data-to-text and reasoning tasks. On the other hand, for ChatGPT, augmenting the prompt modifier with more feedback does not yield improved performance. \n\n> Q2. What if you also add a module that can automatically verify modifications.\n\nAs shown in the \u201cHuman evaluation of prompt modifier performance\u201d part of Section 3.3, most of the prompts outputted by the prompt modifier are semantically correct. Specifically, the correct percentage of  text-davinci-002, ChatGPT, and Vicuna are 88%, 91%, and 83% respectively. So we do not think that it is necessary to automatically verify modifications. \n\n**References**\n\n[1] Mingkai et al, Rlprompt: Optimizing discrete text prompts with reinforcement learning, EMNLP 2022.\n\n[2] Pan et al,  Dynamic prompt learning via policy gradient for semi-structured mathematical reasoning, ICLR 2023."
