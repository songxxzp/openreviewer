As for white box: We would rather not compare white-box to black-box attacks since they have *very* different threat models, and this seems to us like an apples-and-oranges comparison.\n* We don\u2019t know the actual reason for this but we think that the RLHF used in LLaMA2-7b is better in terms of \u201cfulfilling the user\u2019s request\u201d than the supervised instruction tuning used in Vicuna. We have used the same dataset and same train/set split. We have tried different configurations to see the differences between these two models.\n* We have tried transferability to ChatGPT but it failed. It would seem that OpenAI has strengthened ChatGPT in response to the Zou et al. paper. This cat-and-mouse game is to be expected. That said, we added many more experiments with 13B models, which we were able to run with our given academic resources.\n* We have clarified all the above in the revised version.\n\nWe hope these revisions address your concerns and strengthen the paper.\n\nWe've uploaded a revised version.\n\nThanks!"

The authors provide an optimization-based formulation, and describe the steps of their algorithm in detail.  They also conduct a set of experiments using the harmful behaviors dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of their method.\n\n\n**Summary of my rating.**  Based on the discussion in this review, my initial assessment is as follows.  This paper is among the first to propose an automated black box jailbreak for LLMs.  The setting is of interest, the authors can claim novelty in their problem selection.  The empirical results also seem quite strong.  However, the problem formulation and notation are somewhat loose/non-rigorous, the paper lacks comparisons to baseline algorithms (which they open the door to earlier on in the paper), the experiments admit methodological concerns, particularly WRT the training and test split, the discussion of related work is sparse, and the conclusions don't necessarily align with the evidence.  For this reason, despite the novelty of this approach, my assessment is that this paper is not yet ready for publication, and could be significantly strengthened in a subsequent draft."

This setting is of particular interest, especially nowadays, since many popular LLMs are only available as black boxes.  If methods can be designed that reliably jailbreak black box LLMs, and particularly if they are relatively query efficient, this paper could have strong impact.\n\nJailbreaking LLMs is also a relatively new problem setting, and the authors are correct that they are among the first to propose a black box algorithm for accomplishing this task.  This constitutes novelty, and will factor into my overall assessment of this paper.\n\n**Experimental results.** At face value, the empirical results are quite strong.  The authors report ASRs in the mid-ninety-percent range for both Llama2 and Vicuna.  These numbers are notably stronger than white-box attacks like GCG (although the experimental set up is different, as discussed in more detail below).  The authors also report relatively strong transferability in the appendix.\n\n**Writing.** The paper is generally free of typos and grammatical errors."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "### Problem formulation\n---\n\nThe problem formulation could benefit from a rewrite.  The notation is relatively loose/non-standard, and the writing could be polished.  Here are some comments:\n\n* In the equation following \u201cHence, the universal attack. . .\u201d on page 5, the optimization variable is not explicitly included in the objective, which will likely confuse readers.  \n* The authors use the words \u201clexicon\u201d and \u201cvocabulary\u201d to refer to the same set.  \n* The fitness function $\\mathcal{L}$ is defined in two different ways\n* Calligraphic notation is used for functions and for integers.  Consider using lower-case letters, e.g., $n$ and $m$, for your hyper parameters and calligraphic fonts for your losses, e.g., $\\mathcal{L}\n* It would be clearer if the authors used equation numbers.\n* The algorithms are written out in words.  It may be clearer if the authors use the notation used in the paper to write out the steps of the algorithm.\n\n### Lack of experimental evidence\n---\n\n**Comparisons to GCG.** Regarding comparisons to GCG, it\u2019s arguable that as the proposed algorithm is meant for the black-box settings whereas GCG is a white-box attack, a comparison is not needed.  However, there are a few reasons why I think a comparison to GCG is necessary for this work.\n\nFirstly, while discussing their past work, the authors say the following:\n\n> \u201cOur black box approach does not rely on a model\u2019s internals, and thus we do not need to deal with these kinds of difficulties. Other recent works of ours have focused on leveraging evolutionary algorithms in black box scenarios, showing that we can match or surpass white box results, without recourse to model internals, and using no costly gradient descent.\u201d\n\nIf a comparison between white-box and black-box algorithms had not been mentioned, one could make a stronger argument regarding why the comparison is not needed.  However, since the authors opened the door to this, and note that they offered such a comparison in past work, it seems reasonable to expect such a comparison here.\n\nSecondly, although GCG is a white-box attack, the authors of the GCG paper show that attacks optimized for Vicuna and Llama2 can be transferred to black box LLMs, resulting in non negligible ASRs.  In this way, one could view GCG as a black box attack for models like GPT, Claude, and PaLM when the suffixes are transferred from Llama2 or Vicuna.  \n\n**Black-box attacks.**  One of the main arguments in the paper is that the proposed attack works in the black-box setting, wherein the attacker doesn\u2019t have access to the parameters of the LLM.  The authors motivate this in the following way:\n\n> \u201cThough successful, the attack is limited because due to its white-box nature, meaning full access to the targeted model, including architecture, gradients and more. Such access is often not granted in real life.\u201d\n\nGiven this, one would certainly expect to see experiments on LLMs that are exclusively available as black boxes, i.e., models that are only available via API calls (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, etc.).  However, the experiments are only performed on open-source LLMs\u2014specifically, Llama2 and Vicuna.  The paper feels incomplete without these experiments.\n\n**Concerns about performance.**  The scores reported by the authors are impressive \u2014 they claim to be able to achieve ASRs in the high 90% range for both Llama2 and Vicuna.  However, I think that more context is needed before these results are publishable.  Specifically, how was the ASR measured here?  That is, how did the authors determine whether or not a jailbreak occurred?  In the GCG paper, the authors check for various strings (e.g., \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or \u201cAs an AI language model\u201d) in the response.  Was the same criteria used here?  If the authors used the same method as in the GCG paper, then the results would indicate that this black-box attack is *significantly* more effective than the white-box GCG attack, which is unintuitive, given that GCG has more information about the network at its disposal.\n\n**Repeats.**  The authors split the harmful behaviors dataset into training and test subsets.  However, it\u2019s arguable as to whether this split makes sense, especially because harmful behaviors contains numerous duplicates.  For instance, there are several dozen queries that\u2014using nearly identical language\u2014ask the LLM to generate instructions detailing how one would build a bomb.  Therefore, there is undoubtedly some mixing between the training and test set, and so the extent to which we should consider these attacks to be universal is questionable.\n\n### Paper feels unfinished\n---\n\n**Is this paper finished?**  This paper feels unfinished.  Aside from stating their results for direct and transferred attacks, there are no other experiments.  One would expect to see detailed ablation studies, including (1) testing different embedding functions, (2) measuring the query efficiency of the method, (3) comparisons to baselines (e.g., GCG), (4) a more detailed discussion/set of results regarding how to choose the hyper parameters, and so on. Table 2 is also deferred to the appendix, which seems strange given that the authors did not hit the nine page limit.  \n\nThe paper is also sparse on examples of prompts outputted by this algorithm.  The appendix contains several abbreviated examples, but given that this attack is black box and presumably query efficient, one would expect to see quite a few examples of this behavior on a range of LLMs.\n\n**Discussion doesn\u2019t align with experiments.** The authors claim the following:\n\n> \u201cOur results almost consistently demonstrated that, as the added prompt length increased, the effectiveness of the attack improved.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem to hold based on Tables 1 and 2, both of which show numerous parameter settings which lead to the opposite of the described behaviors.  That is, there are many cases where increasing $\\mathcal{M}$ (the prompt length) decreases the ASR.\n\nThe authors also say that\n\n> \u201cThroughout the generations we observed progressive improvement of generated outputs. . .\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not sure what \u201cprogressive\u201d means here.  If it means that as $\\mathcal{N}$ and $\\mathcal{M}$ increase, the ASR increases, as stated above, I don\u2019t think that this claim is emphatically backed by evidence.  If the authors mean something else, then at the very least it\u2019s unclear what this part of the discussion contributes.\n\n### Related work\n---\n\n**Self-citation.** The authors cite three anonymized versions of their past work.  I\u2019ve never seen this before.  It\u2019s unclear how I should evaluate these claims, given that there is no link provided to these papers.  Perhaps a better avenue would be to cite other works that (a) use genetic algorithms in the context of black-box attacks on deep learning systems and (b) are not written by the authors.  That way, the authors could mix in their own work with the work of others without having to anonymize.  This would give a more balanced view of related work, because as written, the paper reads as if the authors\u2019 anonymized works are the only relevant black box attacks which use genetic algorithms; a quite google scholar search reveals that there is plenty of work by authors at numerous different institutions.\n\n**Other LLM attacks.**  It would be worth at least mentioning that there are numerous other attacks (both white and black box) that have been shown to be effective on different LLMs.  \n\n* The website https://www.jailbreakchat.com/ lists quite a few black box attacks, although notably, most of these aren\u2019t automated.  \n* Aside from GCG, there are other white box algorithms that can jailbreak LLMs, including AutoPrompt (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15980) which accomplishes roughly the same goal as GCG (although it has been shown to be less effective).  See also GBDA (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13733), PEZ (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03668), TSP (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.04237.pdf), and https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15447.pdf. \n\nWhile you don\u2019t necessarily need to compare to these methods, it would strengthen the paper to include these papers in your related work section.\n\n**Discussion of other attacks.**  The paper could write about past work in a more positive way.  The authors say that \n\n> \u201cAnother problem with a white-box attack involves the enormous number of LLM parameters, resulting in very high GPU and memory consumption. Thus, a white-box approach is extremely costly. Moreover, due to the tokens\u2019 discrete nature, it is impossible to use standard gradient descent directly on the tokens and the algorithm needs to be drastically modified.\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cdrastically\u201d mean here.  The coordinate ascent algorithm used in GCG is a relatively straightforward adaptation of gradient ascent, in that the only extra step is the top-k sampling used after computing the gradients in token space.  Indeed, given the use of the cross-entropy loss, one could argue that the attack is remarkably similar to attacks used in the adversarial examples literature, given that jailbreaking considers an entirely different problem over discrete tokens.\n\nRelatedly, the authors say that\n\n> \u201cNonetheless, the success of these attacks on the aligned models under scrutiny has proven to be somewhat limited (Kaddour et al., 2023). This limitation stems from the intricacies of optimizing discrete tokens for language-model attacks, as well as from the fundamental distinction that\u2014unlike in image-based attacks\u2014subtle textual perturbations are rarely imperceptible nor well-defined. In numerous classification tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, this necessitates modifications to the attack to guarantee that token substitutions do not alter the underlying text class.\u201d\n\nAt this point, it\u2019s more or less established that attacks like GCG and AutoPrompt are quite effective at breaking aligned LLMs.  Moreover, is the fact that token-optimization-based approaches don\u2019t result in imperceptible perturbations a limitation?  These attacks\u2014to be the best of my understanding\u2014are not designed to produce imperceptible attacks.  Moreover, the proposed genetic-algorithm-based approach also has this limitation, in that a human can generally discern an unattached prompt from an attacked prompt.\n\n### Writing\n---\n\nThere are some weaknesses associated with the writing.\n\n**Bullet points.**  The bullet points on pages 1-2 are relatively vague, and the result is that they don\u2019t seem to carry much information content.  What do the authors mean by \u201cnuanced biases?\u201d Could you include a citation or definition or a broader discussion?  What does it mean for prompts to be \u201ccontextually relevant to trigger-specific responses?\u201d  \u2014 in particular, what is the \u201ccontext\u201d here?  What does it mean to \u201c*effectively* manipulate\u201d this context (emphasis is mine)?  What do the authors mean by \u201cinternal mechanisms\u201d and by \u201c*dynamic* model behavior (again, emphasis is mine)?  What are the \u201cevolving defense mechanisms\u201d mentioned by the authors? \u2014 could you cite something here?  Do such defenses even exist, beyond alignment-based fine-tuning/RLHF?  Overall, all of this text feels overly generic, and the paper could be improved by tightening this up with specific claims that are backed by citations and evidence."

                        "value": "> \"We fixed all the problem formulations you\u2019ve mentioned as weaknesses.\"\n\nGreat, I think that these changes have improved the paper.\n\n> \"There are no known black-box attacks. As for white box: We would rather not compare white-box to black-box attacks since they have very different threat models, and this seems to us like an apples-and-oranges comparison.\"\n\nI don't necessarily agree, for two reasons. \n\n1. **The authors claim to have done this before.** As the authors mentioned in the original submission, \"Other recent works of ours have focused on leveraging evolutionary algorithms in black box scenarios, showing that we can match or surpass white box results.\"  It seems inconsistent to claim that your past work compared black- and white-box algorithms, but to assert here that the comparison does not make sense.  \n2. **Transferrable attacks are black-box w/r/t the target model.** To quote from my original review, \"although GCG is a white-box attack, the authors of the GCG paper show that attacks optimized for Vicuna and Llama2 can be transferred to black box LLMs, resulting in non negligible ASRs. In this way, one could view GCG as a black box attack for models like GPT, Claude, and PaLM when the suffixes are transferred from Llama2 or Vicuna.\" In my view, this would constitute a fair comparison, and it seems that reviewer `53vJ` agrees.\n\n> \"We have added the number of queries to the model; for a population size of 10, we end up with 50k queries. for a population size of 20 \u2013 100k queries, and for a population size of 30 \u2013 150k queries. Not surprisingly, we need more queries than a white-box attack.\"\n\nThis response confused me. The authors have asserted that it doesn't make sense to compare their algorithm to white-box attacks, but in the response, they compare (the query efficiency of) their algorithm to white-box attacks. Moreover, it's not clear to me why a black-box attack would need more queries than a white-box attack, and why is this is unsurprising. There is evidence in the (very recent) literature that the opposite can be true (see, e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08419.pdf).\n\n> \"We have used another seed split and averaged the results.\"\n\nI'm not sure what this was in response to, or which results this is referring to.  Is this for Table 1?\n\n> \"We have added many more experiments including more population sizes, more text-embedders, seeds, and models.\"\n\nI think that the additional experiments positively impact the paper.  I suppose one message of Table 1 is that the text embedder doesn't make a whole lot of difference, given that the attack is relatively successful for each of the three embedders that were tested.\n\n> \"We embedded the self-citation in the related-work section.\"\n\nGreat, I think that this will improve the clarify of that section.\n\n**Post-rebuttal thoughts.** Overall, I think that the paper has been improved after the rebuttal.  There are additional experiments, the text is clearer, and the related work section has been edited.  However, I still have concerns.  \n* I think that a comparison is needed here, and as explained above, I do not agree that comparing black- and white-box algorithms would be unfair in this case.  \n* I still do not understand why LLMs that are exclusively available as black boxes were not used (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard, Claude, etc.).  This seems to be the most natural setting for this algorithm, and the reason why black-box attacks are so important.\n* As I mentioned in my original review, the training/test set is contaminated for AdvBench.  This doesn't seem to have been addressed in the rebuttal.\n\nAnd while these concerns do remain, since I believe that the paper has improved post rebuttal, it's only fair that I raise my score."

For example, the attack could be compared against a whitebox version as a baseline or an upper bound of a stronger attack. The paper also does not extensively evaluate the transferability (e.g., against the API models, or across more diverse options of source vs target models). This might help to understand when attacks are more successful/transferrable, also it would motivate the attack (is it more transferrable than optimizing on an ensemble of whitebox models?)."

In order to test if the attack is \"universal\" across different prompts, I think it makes sense to partition the examples by topic. \n- how is the success rate computed? the paper mentions that the attack succeeds if the target string is produced exactly. I imagine this has some limitations. Examples in fig. 4 do not show the output starting from \"Yes, sure...\". Also, is it possible that the model would start by \"Yes, sure...\" and not answer the harmful prompt? I imagine it might be possible especially when the length of the adversarial tokens increases."

That said, we added many more experiments with 13B models, which we were able to run with our given academic resources.\n\nQuestions:\n* The space of added suffixes is huge \u2013 indeed, it grows exponentially with the length of the suffix. So there are multiple possible solutions, which is why we tried different lengths and different population sizes. We noted that it was not overly arduous to generate different universal adversarial suffixes. So we have now performed more experiments, including different text embedders, seeds, and population size. We show the quantitative results in the newly revised paper.\n* The target sentences are taken from the dataset \u201charmful behavior\u201d and are \u201cSure, here is a\u2026\u201d\n* The dataset set was randomly partitioned, using 2 different seeds that we now added to the qualitative results.\n* At first, the success rate was computed according to  \u201cSure\u2026\u201d, but following your comments, we made sure that the output is good by also doing additional runs, verifying that the output sentence doesn\u2019t have any text from a given list of rejections, including: (``I'm not sure``, ``I'm sorry, I can't``, ``No, I don't``, ``I cannot``, ``As an AI``).\n* We have clarified all the above in the revised version.\n\nWe hope these revisions address your concerns and strengthen the paper.\n\nWe've uploaded a revised version.\n\nThanks!"

Specifically:\n- The paper's main motivation for using a black-box setup is that a lot of models are black-box, which is a very valid motivation. However, the attacks don't transfer to black-box models. The paper does not also compute the attack by querying black-box models. \n- Given the previous point, I believe that comparing to a white-box attack is not comparing \"apples to oranges\", especially since previous white-box attacks (e.g., done on an ensemble of models) showed more transferability."

The paper proposes an approach based on genetic algorithms, in which sentences from a set of initial prompts are combined to maximize a fitness function. The paper utilizes a text embedding to define a fitness function which does not depend on model output probabilities. The method is evaluated on Llama-7b and Vicuna-7b models, demonstrating strong success rates on a test set of harmful behaviors."
