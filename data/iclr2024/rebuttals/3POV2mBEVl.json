Factor models are very popular in financial literature for modelling dependencies between price returns. The authors propose a method to estimate the PCA in the case where the error is measured with a generalised norm $\\| \\cdot \\|_{V}$.\n\nThe estimation method is based on alternating gradient descent, where the matrix decomposition factors are optimized directly.\n\nUnfortunately, the paper does not offer anything new to the machine learning community, and I think there is not much for the financial literature as well. It is very well known that PCA can be solved by optimizing the factors in matrix decomposition with SGD. The questions that are actually interesting - choice of K, number of factors, and choice of matrix V that measures the distance, are conveniently silenced."

This estimator is designed to identify a factor pricing model that effectively captures the time-series variation of asset returns while addressing the cross-sectional correlations of the errors observed in real-world data. Unlike existing estimators with analytically solvable minimization problems, the proposed PCA-XC relies on a challenging regularized minimization problem. To tackle this difficulty, the authors put forward an approximate algorithm based on the alternating least squares method for solving the new estimator."

The presence of a general matrix $V$ creates a computational hurdle. Specifically, the estimator of Lettau & Pelgar (2020a,b) can be solved easily; however, the new estimator with a general $V$ does not have a simple closed-form characterization and is obtained via the alternating least squares. Proposition 4.1 provides conditions under which the proposed solutions are unique. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the proposed estimator."
