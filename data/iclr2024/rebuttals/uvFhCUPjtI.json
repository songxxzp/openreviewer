We provide our answers point-wise (P1, P2...Pn) and seek guidance/advice on making suggested changes in the revised version.\n\n> P1:  the proposed method depends on the approximate \\Psi_{AD}, the eigendecomposition of L_{J_d}. It is unclear whether any limitations associated with this will be introduced.\n-  One known limitation of eigendecomposition is that it is invariant to the sign/direction of the basis vector. This may cause issues with learning since the basis is not normalized. This can be resolved by the sign and basis invariant methods [1]. Moreover \\Psi_{AD} is not designed to handle signed and directed graphs. Future works can explore how to generalize the laplacian as well as the proposed EFT to generic signed and directed graphs using techniques proposed in [2] and [3]. Do you recommend we add this discussion to the main paper?\n\n> P2: I am wondering whether EFT could embed the timespan of edges and how.\n-  The proposed neural architecture could be adapted to make use of timespan information as edge features for learning in the SR datasets. This could be an interesting future direction to explore the application of EFT along with task-specific features to enhance downstream performance. However here we focus on a joint spectral transform for dynamic graphs and to show its benefits on dynamic graphs, but we agree that the methods can further augment the method using task-specific features.  \n\n> What does the dimension-wise mean?\n- Dimension-wise means the feature dimension of a node. Each node may have a multidimensional signal residing on it and the EFT can be independently applied to each channel or dimension for the dynamic graph. We shall add this in the revised version of the paper.\n\nWe thank you again for spending time on our paper and providing reviews. Depending on your advice, we will add proposed changes to the next version of the paper.

The gist of the proposed approach lies in the decomposition of the spatial/graph domain and the temporal domain, reducing the computational complexity from $O((NT)^3)$ (performing GFT/SVD over the entire spatio-temporal domain) to $O(N^3T + NT \\log(T))$. Furthermore, the proposed transform was shown to be robust to structural perturbations, and comprehensive simulations verified the utility of the transform when combined with some vanilla transformer models to perform link prediction tasks."

However, performing GFT over the entire spatio-temporal graph is typically computationally expensive, which hinders the spectrum analysis of spatio-temporal signals. This paper provided solid theoretical guarantees for using Evolving Graph Fourier Transform (EFT: DFT+GFT in order) to approximate the absolute decomposition (AD) with reasonably low approximation error. Standard properties of the transform are established in section 5.1 as well. For the simulations, it is also very interesting to see that EFT can be used within transformer models to perform sequential link prediction tasks in practice."

                    "value": "The idea of decoupling spatial and temporal domains in spatio-temporal data analysis is actually not new, especially for the spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GCN) community. As a matter of fact, most existing ST-GCN models, no matter their design come from empirical perspectives [1, 2, 3] or theoretical perspectives [4, 5], all share the idea of graph-time decoupling to reduce the computational complexity. However, only a handful of prior works on ST-GCNs have been mentioned and discussed in the paper. I understand that the authors are considering graphs that change with time, for which most ST-GCNs are not directly applicable as they deal with static graphs, but I still believe related discussions should be added so that the readers are clearer about the contribution of this paper. Furthermore, the complexity of the proposed approach seems quite similar to those in [5]. The authors may also want to have some comments on that as well.\n\nIn addition, for the approximation of EFT to work, two extra assumptions are needed in place: 1) The rate of change of the graph with time is bounded; 2) The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian at any given timestep and between timesteps have a multiplicity of 1. I think it is better to state these assumptions in the main text instead of the appendix to help the readers better understand the limit of the approach, as the assumptions are quite important (and intuitive) for the EFT to work.\n\n[1] Yan, Sijie, Yuanjun Xiong, and Dahua Lin. \"Spatial temporal graph convolutional networks for skeleton-based action recognition.\" Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence.

We have incorporated the changes in the revised version of the paper.\n\n> P3: Regarding spectral clustering and advantages of EFT over it\n- We would like to remark that EFT is a transform (like GFT) and in order to use it in representation learning we would need to further process the transformed signals for example by filtering etc. Spectral clustering is an algorithm for clustering that uses the GFT transform for static graphs. While recognizing the inherent differences between EFT and spectral clustering, it seems challenging to draw direct comparisons, however, it is an important research direction raised by the reviewer to explore EFT for benefits in spectral clustering in the case of dynamic graphs. As in the standard method, we could compute the EFT of a dynamic graph, then use a clustering method in order to perform the clustering using the EFT rows as \u201cfeature vectors\u201d. Thus EFT could be used to compute the spectral clustering. Also, future works could explore using the state-of-the-art method to approximately compute the GFT of graphs at future timesteps that can be used to compute the EFT which can further be used for fast spectral clustering and other applications.\n\n> Just curious, beyond link prediction, what changes would we need if we also want to predict node features?\n-  We have used EFT in our experiments to perform node classification. Specifically, two of the datasets (Elliptic, Brain) used in Table 2 are node classification datasets. To contrast with link prediction: In link prediction, we provide signals from the two participating nodes as input to the task-specific layer eg: concatenation of node features followed by MLP layer. For node classification, we only provide the node under consideration to the downstream task-specific layer which could be an MLP.

We provide our answers point-wise (P1, P2...Pn) and seek guidance/advice on making suggested changes in the revised version.\n\n> P1: Regarding presentation\n- Thank you for your feedback on the presentation. We have incorporated the changes in the revised version of the paper. Regarding the example for showing connection to dft and gft we think the example of ring of ring graphs perfectly is able to capture the phenomena. Do you suggest we incorporate it in the paper? Once you confirm, we can add that to the final camera-ready version of the paper as a running example. \n\n> P2: It would help the readers if more insights are given in terms of small toy examples. What will be harmonics for ring of ring graphs (no edge addition or dropping over time)? Does this have some relation to classical Fourier transform?\n- For a ring graph we can show that the laplacian is a circulant matrix and the eigendecomposition gives the basis vectors of the DFT(classical Fourier transform) matrix with the eigenvalues the corresponding frequencies. For a ring of ring graphs, we can show (using property 1) that the EFT matrix comes out to be the Kronecker product of two DFT matrices (one along the time domain and one along the vertex domain). Similarly, the harmonics will be the Kronecker sum of the harmonics along the individual domains. To remark, we can say that the GFT is a generalization of DFT and the EFT is a generalization of GFT, for dynamic graphs. We have added discussions of this in the revised version of the paper.\n\nWe thank you again for spending time on our paper and providing reviews. Depending on your advice, we will add proposed changes to the camera-ready version of the paper. We look forward to your reply.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAuthors"

We provide our answers point-wise (P1, P2...Pn) and seek guidance/advice on making suggested changes in the revised version. Meanwhile, we uploaded a version where new changes are marked with green text color. \n\n> P1: Despite giving guarantees on the approximation part, this work does not address the theoretical guarantees of learning under this module. Hence this makes this work more like heuristic. The reviewer believes that this might be quite difficult though.\n- The architecture is designed from the theoretical motivation. From the theory, we see how to decompose the joint Fourier Transform for the Dynamic graph into individual components of Fourier Transforms along the temporal aspect and vertex domain. The empirical approximation of the model further depends on the errors introduced by the components used to approximate the filters such as from the truncated Chebyshev polynomials etc. While we have shown from the empirical results of the neural architecture that learning the joint frequency components as proposed by the theory benefits the dynamic graph representation learning, it is an interesting point mentioned by the reviewer regarding deriving further bounds for the errors introduced by the approximation of the model implementation. \n\nWe believe that, taking inspiration from previous works [1] we could work on further bounding the approximation ability of the model. Would you suggest we discuss this in the paper, especially as future work in the conclusion section?\n\n\n> P2: The font size of the tables should be improved.\n- Thank you for your feedback on the presentation. We have incorporated the changes in the revised version of the paper. The new changes are marked with the green text color. \n\n> P3: The question is how is the complexity of computing this transform. How fast it can be computed compared with other baselines and can it be efficiently computed empirically.\n- The computational complexity of the transform is $\\mathcal{O}(N^3T + NTlog(T))$. However this reduces in the neural architecture where we use polynomial approximations. The overall computational complexity of the neural architecture is $\\mathcal{O}(E + NTlogT)$.\nAs suggested by the reviewer we also compute the wall clock running time of our method and compare it against baselines. The below table shows the time taken in seconds per epoch of our method (EFT) vs the average over the baselines. Our work significantly reduces the complexity at empirical level if simple eigenvector decomposition would have been considered against the proposed computationally efficient EFT. \n\nDataset  | Average Baseline  | Full EVD | *EFT (our implementation)* | \n| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: | -----------: | \n|SBM| 68.35 | 1419.40  | 68.97 |\n| UCI | 275.24 |  2493.20  | 276.36 |\n| AS | 115.34 |   2614.59   | 116.60 | \n| Brain | 2.86 | 124.67  | 2.95  |\n| Elliptic | 70.12 | 14329.54  | 71.66  |\n\nFrom the above table we see that the running time of our method is comparable to the baselines and that empirically it can be computed efficiently. Note our implementation saves time over the full EVD version (which has a complexity cubic in the number of nodes).\n\nWe thank you again for spending time on our paper and providing reviews. Depending on your advice, we will add proposed changes to the next version of the paper. We look forward to your reply.\n\nKind regards,\n\nAuthors\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3848"
