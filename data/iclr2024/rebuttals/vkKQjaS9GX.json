                    "value": "Classical robust MDP-based methods require knowledge about the permissible range of perturbations that can be applied to the environment in test time. To overcome it, diversity RL tries to generate different close to optimal behaviors in the training to have robustness in test time. However, previous methods are compromised due to suboptimal choices in diversity measures. This paper offers a new diversity measure, which could be used as an intrinsic reward. Finally, the authors justify the proposed diversity measure theoretically and empirically."

Due to the property of maximum entropy, SAC was shown to solve some robust RL problems by maximizing the lower bound on a robust RL objective [Eysenbach and Levine 2022, Maximum entropy RL solves some robust RL problems]. \n* It is better to give empirical results under different perturbations. Additionally, more results of other discrete environment (e.g., perturbed CartPole) and MuJoCo environment experiments (e.g., HalfCheetah, Walker) are expected.\n\nClarity:\n* Currently, related works are placed between approach and experiments.

Since the goal is to find a policy that sacrifices its performance in the training environment inorder to induce diversity so that there would be a better performance in the perturbed test environment. We find the lower reward experienced in the training environment on average to be as expected. \n* In terms of SAC it does maximizes diversity but it does so by maximizing the policy. But the other baselines and the current work does so by maximizing the steady state occupancy with regards to other policies while maximizing the entropy of the policy as well since SAC is used as the base algorithm. That is the reason for the difference in reward in the test environment when a major perturbation was done. \n* The reviewer's comments with regards to the lack of more experiments and pertubations was well taken and acknowledged.   \n* With regards to the standard deviation we have avoided it because it was the standard deviation among different polices not the standard deviation of a singular policy and for a diverse set of policy it was supposed to be higher as the aim of the paper is to find polices such that certain polices perform well under certain scenarios in the expense of not being good in certain scenarios. We have added the standard deviation now."

This can lead to the diversity function itself changing with the change in policy. When maximizing the diversity is the objective the policy can change such that the functional dependency is exploited and the diversity measure grows well beyond the reward thus resulting in diversity by suboptimal policies. \n* The point with regards to adding entropy regularizer was well taken. Within the scope of this paper we were only evaluating the effectiveness of the existing diversity measure while keeping the base RL algorithm constant. That was the reason why we didn\u2019t consider the addition of additional entropy regularizer terms. But this is a point that was well  taken. \n* The obstacles added in case of the experiments were limited to changes in the transition probability of the environment. Thus the state space remains the same. For instance in the gridworld setting the presence of the obstacle doesn\u2019t change the state space but only how the state transitions near the obstacle. This is an unseen transition. Similarly for the Mujoco tasks we used the transition changes in the form of perturbation on the joints. \n* The point about the scalability in complex environments is well taken. In the scope of this paper we didn\u2019t perform experiments on complex environments with visual state inputs. \n* With regards to the standard deviation we have avoided it because it was the standard deviation among different polices not the standard deviation of a singular policy and for a diverse set of policy it was supposed to be higher as the aim of the paper is to find polices such that certain polices perform well under certain scenarios in the expense of not being good in certain scenarios.

For instance, It was hard to tell what was claimed to be \"ideal\" and why that would be \"ideal.\"  Theorem 1 references the \"idea diversity measure,\" but there is never an equation or expression named that clearly. Similarly, for the \"information-based diversity\" and the \"proposed diversity\".  \n\nSimilarly, there are many equations in section 3 that are claimed to be related, but the relationships are never proven or stated formally. Where they are formal, they appear to be incorrect. For instance, equation 3 claims a direct correspondence between the KL divergence and a function approximator, which would not be true for a random neural network.  It's not clear how this function approximator factors into equation 2 since neither KL divergence nor the function approximator are listed in equation 2.\n\nThere are also many references to nitty-gritty details of other methods which are never introduced or made explicit enough to track down. For instance, the sentence before equation 5 states that it removes the need for an indicator variable, but it's not clear why that would otherwise have been needed.\n\n\nA related issue to the lack of clarity is the lack of motivation. For instance, equation 2 appears quite arbitrary and is not really introduced. The justification comes later when it is claimed that it is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the steady-state distribution but is easier to compute. If that is true, then \"maximizing the entropy of the steady state distribution\" should be the measure, and this should be later introduced as a way of more easily computing it.\n\nSimilarly, there is a claim in the introduction that having more policies helps robustness, but it is not clear why that would be."

For instance when the indicator random variable becomes zero the samples will correspond to the optimal objective. Only when indicator random variable remains non zeros would the samples correspond to the diverse but close to optimal objective. But given that the diversity measure itself functionally depends on policy unless the $\\kappa$ parameter is not properly tuned the diversity measure can grow beyond the range of reward at which point the policy will generate diverse by suboptimal behavior which will eventually result in the indicator random variable becoming zero and the objective effectively turning into a traditional RL objective. Thus it is hard to train diverse and close to optimal behavior in the presence of such an indicator random variable. We have added the explanation in the paper. Also if there is an indicator random variable of such nature then the replay buffer will be filled with policies following different objectives (when it is zero vs when it is not zero) which is not ideal for training as we practically saw this would lead to them learning only the optimal behavior in the absence of the enough support for a diverse close to optimal behavior. \n* Generating more policies that are different from each other and close to optimal is a paradigm that was followed by the past works (both the information based and steady state based) to induce robustness when there is a lack of any information about the test environment.

Random maximization of the entropy will indeed lead to non ideal states. But in our case we are finding a balance between the reward maximization and the randomness maximization which in some sense constrains the diversity that is induced to be useful in terms of reward. As long as the safety constraints are included in the reward the entropy maximization that is done this way would avoid dangerous states and induce diverse behaviors."

The proposed measure builds upon the concept of maximizing the divergence between the steady-state visitation distributions of the component policies, a notion well-explored in existing literature. In practical terms, optimizing the measure involves augmenting the environmental reward with an intrinsic reward and employing any conventional RL algorithm. The authors contrast their approach with the existing diverse RL methods based on mutual-information maximization and use of successor features. Experiments in grid-world environment and MuJoCo continuous control locomotion environments indicate that the proposed method generates diverse policies that are more robust to environmental perturbations, compared to the baseline methods."

In practice we would like to use the estimated term $\\nu$ as an auxiliary reward. The second expectation on the outside means that we are finding the expectation of that $\\nu$ while we are following the current policy corresponding to $\\pi_i$.  This is equivalent to how we find the reward in a traditional RL setting on expectation. The accumulated reward depends on the policy followed based on how it is accumulated via following the policy but the reward function itself (equivalent to $\\nu$ in our setting) is not dependent on the policy and it remains stationary. This is the sense in which we meant that the reward is independent of the policy. We have added a clarification with regards to this. \n* When it comes to the theorem it should be smaller. Since the difference is smaller our proposed measure is always close to what we argue as the ideal diversity measure\n* In terms of the gridworld experiments we have added some intuition in the paper. The intuition is as follows. Since we have a term with the indicator random variable in the previous objective (which was needed because of the above mentioned dependance  on the policy) it can easily go to zero if the hyper parameter is not tuned properly making the training  objective similar to that of a traditional RL objective. This was very evident as in the case of the gridworld problem where there was only one optimal policy and not many. \n* The policies in the current setup were trained on after the other. That is a z is selected and a policy is trained based on the past policies. But it can be trained in parallel as well. In terms of training in parallel it accounts computing the same objective in equation 2 with respect to the data available from all other policies. The $\\nu$ function in this case needs to be trained in a delayed manner similar to the hard or soft update that is done on Soft Actor Critic value functions before using them for policy optimization."
