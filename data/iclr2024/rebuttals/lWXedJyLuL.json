Equation 1 is not enough, because the structual functions should appear before the graphs. I think it would be better to illustrate Fig 1 with a specific example (i.e., what $L_i, X, Y$ and $T$ stands for in a specific task, and how the non-causal factors correlate with $Y_t$).\n\nQ2. The authors use different $L_i$ for different causal factors, and this is good. Nevertheless, I think $Y_t$ in Fig.1 should also be notated as different nodes for different $t$. \n\nQ3. The authors claim that \"Causally speaking, there\nexist backdoor paths between the target labels and non-causal latent factors through the task\nvariable T.\". But when we are doing a task, the task variable is given. And in Fig.1, we have $L_i \\perp L_j|T$. So, there must be a problem arising from either the claim itself or the causal graph. Considering question Q1, I think it is more likely the latter. I would appreciate it if the authors could provide a specific example to illustrate how the non-causal factors can correlate with $Y_t$ (e.g., the simplest text classification). This is one of the most important questions for me, and I'm looking forward to the authors' response.\n\nQ4. Following the above question, even if $T$ can act as a confounder and spurious correlations exist in the data, how does the traditional training process make the model learn the spurious correlations? This problem is also untouched, which makes the motivation informal and weak.\n\nQ5. It seems that the only confounder in this paper is the task $T$, I can hardly come up with any applications where different features are caused by the task but don't cause the target label.\n\nQ6. Section 3.2 is really hard to follow. How to alleviate the influence of the spurious correlations? By backdoor adjustment or introducing intervened data?\n\nQ7. The definition of identifiability is confusing. What's the identifiability of a SCM? When we say the identifiability, it usually refers to the causal quantity on two specific variables rather than a SCM. Also, the target of the UIC loss in Eq.6 is vague. What causal quantity do you want to measure?\n\nQ8. I guess the authors want to say that, if $L_i$ is identifiable, then it is the causal factor of $Y_t$. So, the UIC loss is used to promise the identifiability. There are two issues need to be addressed. One is why identifiable factors are causal ones, and another is why UIC can select identifiable factors. I'm not clear whether the second problem has been addressed by Section 3.2, since I think it's not well orangized. Nevertheless, I think the first problem is untouched.\n\nQ9. I'm not sure whether the baselines are advanced enough. The paper only compares with two simple baselines."

                        "value": "We deeply appreciate your careful, detailed review. Your thorough feedback is valuable for revising our paper - we have re-uploaded the modified version highlighting major changes in blue. The questions you ask are critical, and they all involve the core of our research. We are honored to discuss them with you.\n\nBefore answering your questions, we first provide a driven example, which we hope will intuitively show the motivation for our modeling, the potential cause of spurious correlation, and our solution:\n\n**Driven example:**\n \nLet's consider the sentence \"Pizza is delicious.\" This is an instance of the random variable $X_t$ in our paper. This sentence contains information about food, \"pizza\", and sentiment, \"delicious.\" Accordingly, we introduce latent factors to represent different types of information. Specifically, $ L_1$ represents food information and $L_2$ represents sentiment. Thus, we have $L_1, L_2 \\rightarrow X_t$ . We use $Y_t$ to represent the target labels of different tasks, which require different latent factors, such as $L_1$ for topic classification and $L_2$ for sentiment classification. \nDue to inherent dataset properties (probably from sampling bias), spurious correlation may arise. For example, in a dataset sampled from pizza enthusiasts for sentiment classification, pizza, as a food concept, will frequently co-occur with positive emotion, causing spurious correlation between food and sentiment labels.\nIn our paper, we intended $D$ to represent inherent dataset properties and thus $D \\rightarrow L_1, L_2$ . Since $D$ denotes internal properties, it is unobservable. For $Y_t$ of sentiment classification, there is a backdoor path between $Y_t$ and $L_1$, i.e., $L_1 \\leftarrow D \\rightarrow L_2 \\rightarrow Y_t$ , producing spurious correlation between food information $L_1$ and positive sentiment labels $Y_t$ .\n\n**Unclear statement of $T$ and our revision:**\n\nIn our original paper, for the sake of narrative convenience, we imprecisely used $T$ to denote both inherent dataset properties and tasks. We apologize for any confusion caused by this unclear statement. We sincerely appreciate you raising this critical issue in Q3, alerting us to this imprecision in our writing. We have already revised the paper where we use $D$ for inherent dataset properties and $T$ for tasks separately.\n\n**Answers for Questions:**\n\n**A1** \uff1a\n\nWe agree with you that it is more rigorous to model SCM from the structural equations, and when the structural equations are given, the causal graph will be determined accordingly. The reason we introduced causal graph firstly is that we want to give the reader an intuitive understanding of the data generating process of NLP tasks. This includes introducing the variables and their qualitative causal relationships. An illustrative example corresponding to Fig. 1 has been provided in the above driven example. Thank you very much for your advice.\n\n**A2\uff1a**\n\nThanks for your valuable suggestion. In our modeling, $Y_t$ for different tasks are actually different nodes. For visual simplicity, we depicted only a single $Y_t$ node in the causal graph, and distinguished different tasks by subscript $t$.\n\n**A3\uff1a**\n\nThis is an excellent question and we appreciate you raising this important issue. $T$ should be modified to $D$ to represent inherent dataset properties, which are unobservable. This would make $L_i$ not independent of $L_j$, leading to a backdoor path and inducing spurious correlation. We will correct the imprecision in our writing, which improperly used $T$ to denote both dataset properties and tasks. Thank you again for catching this critical misunderstanding."

                        "value": "**Answers for Questions:**\n\n**A4\uff1a**\n\nWe appreciate you raising this excellent point. The traditional training process optimizes the likelihood $P(Y|X)$, where $X$ contains a mixture of information - some factors causally influence $Y$ while others are spuriously correlated. Without explicitly disentangling the latent factors within $X$, the shortcuts from non-causal variables to $Y$ may be exploited, leading the model to learn these unintended spurious correlations along with the true causal relationships.\n\n**A5\uff1a**\n\nThe $T$ in the original paper should be replaced by $D$, which represents the inherent dataset properties. It can describe the spurious correlation between the target label and the feature (latent factor) by modeling the backdoor between them. We apologize for this misunderstanding because of our unclear writing.\n\n**A6\uff1a**\n\nSince both the inherent dataset properties $D$ and latent factors are unobservable, we cannot directly perform backdoor adjustment or intervention. Therefore, to mitigate spurious correlation, an alternative approach is to only utilize the parent latent factors of each task's $Y_t$ for prediction.  This branch of research can be categorized as causal representation learning [1]. However, being able to select the parent factors relies on latent factor identifiability. Thus, guaranteeing identifiability of latent factors is a core challenge in causal representation learning.\n\n[1] Towards Causal Representation Learning. Proceedings of the IEEE, 2021.\n\n**A7\uff1a**\n\nThat is an excellent question. In causal inference, identifiability refers to \" A causal quantity can be computed from a purely statistical quantity.\" [2]. However, in causal representation learning, identifiability has a different meaning - it indicates that \"Representations for each latent factor can be learned without mixing information with others, while ensuring that the difference between the learned representations and the true representations remains within acceptable bounds of uncertainty\" [3, 4, 5]. The goal of the UIC is to guarantee latent variable identifiability under this definition from causal representation learning.\n\n[2] Introduction to causal inference. 2020.\n\n[3] Self-supervised learning with data augmentations provably isolates content from style.

ICLR 2023.\n\n**A8\uff1a**\n\nThank you for your insightful question. We apologize that Section 3.2 did not effectively communicate our approach regarding identifiability and causal factor selection.\n\nTo clarify, we do not posit that \"if $L_i$ is identifiable, then it is a causal factor of $Y_t$.\" For each task, whether $L_i$ is a causal parent of $Y_t$ is an intrinsic property. In our work, causal factors for different tasks are selected by a binary matrix with 0,1 values. This matrix is learned by maximizing likelihood, similar to score-based causal discovery [6]. Notably, selecting causal factors relies on the premise that the factors $L_i$ are identifiable. Thus, we introduce a UIC Loss as a regularization term to ensure $L_i$ identifiability. While UIC constrains the structure between $L_i$ and $Y_t$, this constraint is flexible. Causal factor selection is still primarily driven by the binary selection matrix.\n\n[6] Generalized score functions for causal discovery. SIGKDD 2018.\n\n**A9\uff1a**\n\nThank you for your questions, we will compare our method to additional baselines using different backbones to further validate its effectiveness.\n\nWe sincerely appreciate you taking the time to ask such insightful questions. It is clear you want to help improve the quality of our paper, for which we are truly grateful. Please feel free to continue the discussion with any other questions you may have. We welcome the opportunity to further clarify and strengthen our work. Thank you again for your dedication and effort in reviewing our submission so thoroughly."

However, the correctness of these adjustments still requires further confirmation. There's also a minor issue: the authors mentioned that additional baselines would be introduced, but this appears to have been overlooked in the revised version of the paper. Reflecting on these adjustments, I have decided to increase my rating to 5, while reducing my confidence level to 2.\n\nAdditionally, I've come across some articles that are notably clear and easy to comprehend. Both [1] and [2] demonstrate effective methods for establishing a solid causal relationship between variables. The authors may find it beneficial to cite and refer to these works in their final, camera-ready revision to enhance the question's framing and the paper's overall readability.\n\nReferences:\n[1] 'Desiderata for Representation Learning: A Causal Perspective,' arXiv:2109.03795.\n[2] 'D-Separation for Causal Self-Explanation,' NeurIPS 2023."
