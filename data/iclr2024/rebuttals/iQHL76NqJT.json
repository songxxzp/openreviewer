The approaches are very close to existing CwR methods (developed for the non-graph setting); it\u2019s difficult to see how the graph has posed an additional, meaningful challenge. \nW2.\tThe experiments are conducted for three small graphs; papers on graph learning really need to go beyond Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed \u2013 there are many benchmark datasets available now. The expectation is that experiments would be conducted with 6-8 datasets, with several being medium- to large- scale. One might also expect experiments in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, and both transductive and inductive. \nW3.\tThe experiments do not compare to any baseline methods. While there may not be prior work that directly addresses this problem, I think it is relatively easy to construct a na\u00efve baseline. A simple baseline would be training a standard node-classifier (ignoring the regret option) to derive embeddings and then using those embeddings in the standard non-graph CwR framework to train an MLP architecture. Another basic baselines would involve rejecting nodes according to a threshold on softmax entropy. \n\nW1 (cont.): The main weakness of the paper is that there is a limited technical contribution. It\u2019s hard to see how the coverage-based classifier differs from SelectiveNet beyond introducing a GAT, which is not a substantial technical innovation. The cost-based approach follows Cao et al. 2022 closely; the only extension seems to be the introduction of label smoothing. The paper needs to make it much clearer what technical challenge arises because of the presence of a graph and how that has led to design differences and innovations. The replacement of a non-graph classifier with a GAT is not enough."

How do we know that the observations extend to graphs from different domains? How do we know that the same observations apply for larger scale graphs?

What about the inductive setting?\nQ3.\tWhy is it not possible to construct a na\u00efve baseline for comparison, using any graph-learning technique to derive embeddings and then treating the problem using the standard CwR approach?"

It is essential to consider the accuracy of these candidates for each threshold, as they significantly impact the overall performance.\n\n3. The presentation of results in tables and figures is unclear. For instance, in Table 1, the meanings of Cov and LS are not explained. \nThe experimental analysis lacks depth and clarity.\n\n4.
