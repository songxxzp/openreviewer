As a result, ReWOO largely reduced the token consumption, which is a major limiting factor to LLMs' applications. Comprehensive experiments on several multi-step reasoning tasks show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Besides, by offloading reasoning from LLMs to smaller language models, end-to-end training is possible."

Although it supports three-fold tasks and several reasoning capabilities, ReWOO is not easy to extend. Obviously, more annotations and re-training/tuning are non-trivial if more tools are required.\n\n2. The experiment settings are not clear enough in the submission version. For Direct Prompt and CoT, which LLMs are employed? Do they also leverage GPT-3.5-turbo? It will be important to make a fair comparison between these distinct experimental settings.\n\n3. Since ReWOO is a modular framework, for the Planner, the quality and diversity of the exemplars can influence performance. The paper lacks experiments for evaluating different exemplars and the proposed method's robustness under such scenarios.\n\n4. The reason why the Direct and CoT could be better than ALMs is not clear. From my understanding, CoT, for example, generates all human-like thoughts in the decoding process, which is different from ReWOO encoding all the plans on the encoding side. One of the reasons for the performance drop is due to tool failure. However, is there any other reason, e.g. the architecture? Detailed discussions need to be covered.\n\n5. What is the relationship between this paper and the question decomposition literature, especially in the QA area?"

                    "value": "1. For the experiment shown in Figure 5, the original intention is to show adding extraneous tools could degrade the model performance. But why is HotpotQA selected for this experiment? For HotpotQA, ReWOO achieves the overall best performance than CoT. Is it more suitable to choose TriviaQA or GSM8K for this analysis? Besides, the exemplars for HotpotQA is 6, which is larger than others. Will this be another influence for conducting such an analysis?\n\n2. The error or performance degradation may come from two aspects: one is tool failure as stated in this paper, and the other is planner failure, from my point of view. Because the planner is not perfect, it could produce unintended consequences/plans that are not aligned with the tasks or datasets. Is there any analysis on this possible cause of failures?"

ReWOO solves reasoning problems in three steps with three modular components. First, a Planner generates a plan to solve the task using the LLM's foreseeable reasoning ability. The Worker retrieves evidence from tools. The Solver synthesizes the plan and evidence into a final solution. Using this way, ReWoo can streamline LLM generation without putting LLMs on halt, which reduces the cost of stateless API service. Experiments over 6 NLP benchmarks show ReWOO uses fewer tokens than ReAct and achieves higher accuracy on average. The paper also explores the possibility of distilling the planning ability to smaller LLM."

Following 1, at the same time, the performance of ReWoo does not show consistent gain compared to CoT and even lags CoT for some datasets when CoT uses much less compute\n\n3. The planning, working, and solving procedure is similar to lots of existing work (e.g., [1][2][3] some of them are missing references). The paper mainly differs in that the workers can be tools.\n\n4. The paper focuses on a somewhat narrow problem. Mainly for reducing the cost for using stateless APIs.

Despite the efficiency of the proposed method,  although the authors claim that \"This paradigm enables ReWOO to tackle multi-step and complex tasks, particularly those where a subsequent step depends on the observations of prior steps\", it does not seem that ReWOO is actually able to tackle multi-step complex tasks where subsequent step (of planning and reasoning) depends on the observations of prior steps. This would greatly limit the use case of the propose method. This is the inevitable bottleneck of separating planning and observation. Furthermore, for many multihop qa questions, google search or other retrieval tools can actually return results from one tool execution, which may not require methods such as ReAct to execute multiple reasoning and planning steps once the observation satisfies the performance; in comparison, ReWOO would always execute all planned executions. It would not be able to backtrack (i.e., issue new tool arguments) based on observations.\n2. The huge gap between ReWOO/ReAct and Direct and CoT on triviaQA and GSM8K makes the evaluation questionable. I understand that sometimes tool-call is not necessary to get an answer correct, but these two tasks are either knowledge-intensive or could greatly benefit from using a calculator. The much lower results for ReAct and ReWOO suggests that either the tool or the prompt is not optimized compared to the direct method. If the authors hypothesize that the issue is due to tool selection, further investigation is required. For example, what the results would be if only the optimal tool is employed. Otherwise, the benefit of using ReWOO is not convincing.\n3. Similarly, there is not enough information about the curated datasets (either in the appendix or in the project repo). This prevents detailed understanding of the performance on these tasks."
