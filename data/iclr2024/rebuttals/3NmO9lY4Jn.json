                    "value": "This article primarily aims to address the issue of diffusion models' inability to generate data samples in low-density regions of the data manifold. Initially, they illustrate that Tweedie's denoising formula tends to generate the majority of samples, which lie in high-density regions of the manifold. Building upon this, they devise the minority score to quantify the uniqueness of the features of a given data instance. Drawing inspiration from classifier guidance, they incorporate minority guidance into the diffusion model to generate samples in low-density regions."

                        "value": "We would like to express our sincere gratitude for your insightful and detailed feedback which indeed helped us to improve the manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses.\n\n---\n\n>**W1.** Given the scarcity of real samples in low-density regions, how is it ensured that the proposed method doesn't suffer from overfitting? In other words, how can the authenticity and diversity of the generated samples in low-density regions be guaranteed?\n\nTo address your concern, we have conducted an investigation into the nearest neighboring real samples of our generated instances. The results indicate that samples from our method exhibit a notable level of novelty. See Figure 24 in our revised manuscript for instance. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates favorable diversity performance as confirmed by our quantitative results (e.g., in Table 1), providing additional support for the robustness of our methodology.\n\n---\n\n>**W2.** The authors should provide more experimental details. For instance, what is the size of the subset of real data used for validation? In the experimental section,what levels of minority score were chosen for generating the data?\n\nThe reviewer is kindly reminded that the suggested information are already contained in Section C. Specifically, the sizes of minority real data used for evaluation are chosen based on the volume of the entire datasets. For instance, we employ the most unique (yielding the highest AvgkNN) 50K real samples on huge benchmarks like LSUN-Bedrooms, while using the rarest 10K (or 5K) samples for relatively small datasets like CelebA. See Section C for more details. The minority classes are often randomly selected from a pool of highly unique classes, e.g., the most unique 10 classes. See Table 2 in Section C for explicit details.\n\n---\n\n>**W3.** In Fig. 1(a), what perturbation timestep was used to generate the noise samples displayed in the middle, 0.9T or T? The choice of 't' is crucial in Section 3.1; the authors should consider showing specific images of xt, x0 and x0hat or provide theoretical evidence that is indeed the reconstructed image.\n\n$0.9T$ was used for the images in Figure 1.(a). The images in \u201cOriginal\u201d column in Figure 1.(a) correspond to $\\boldsymbol{x}_0$, and the ones in \u201cPerturbed\u201d column are $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ (perturbed with $t=0.9T$). The images in \u201cReconstructed\u201d column visualizes $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}_0$ that are reconstructed from $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ in \u201cPerturbed\u201d column. We have reflected this in our revised manuscript; see Figure 1 therein.\n\n---\n\n>**W4.** In the experimental section, the method proposed in this paper did not achieve satisfactory results in terms of both prec and rec. The authors should provide further explanations.\n\nDespite inferiorities in some metrics (like precision), our method works better in the holistic viewpoint as exhibited in the significant gain in comprehensive metrics (e.g., cFID), attaining better trade-offs between quality and diversity of low-density samples. Also, we would like to note that the bad recall performance in LSUN-Bedrooms is mainly because we focused on a narrow range of minorities (i.e., $\\tilde{l} = 99$) for generation (see Table 2 in Section C for the setting). This could be readily resolved by considering a wide range of minority classes (e.g., $\\tilde{l} \\sim \\text{unif} \\lbrace 90, 99 \\rbrace$).\n\n---\n\n>**W5.** The nomenclature in this paper should be more standardized. For instance, in Section 4.2, there is an error in the representation of \\tilde{l}.\n\nFixed. Thanks for pointing out."

In doing so, the author opposed the use of the distance between original data and the denoised version of the same data by a diffusion model as a minority score, inspired by Tweedie\u2019s denosing formulae. Data with larger such score is used to train a auxiliary classifier, which is used to guide the generation with commonly used classifier-guidance approach. Substantial theoretical and empirical results are shown to demonstrate the superiority, especially quantitative, of the proposed method."

Below we provide point-by-point responses.\n\n---\n\n>**W1.** It is unclear how the minority classifier guidance plays with other classifier guidance or classifier-free guidance. From an application perspective, it\u2019s important that users can control the generation through guidance, and a mere generation of minority data, while still being useful for say data augmentation, may limit its value for the end-user if the user cannot control the generation effectively. However, now only in Appendix E some examples are shown for conditional generation and details/quantitative evaluates are omitted. This makes it hard to assess the broader impact of this work.\n\nIn response to your insightful suggestion, we now provide new results that exhibit the interactive aspect of our approach with other forms of guidance. Specifically we incorporated an additional classifier guidance on ImageNet-64 and found that the impact of classifier guidance persists even in the presence of our minority guidance. Below we exhibit the accuracy outcomes of an ImageNet classifier applied to generated samples across a spectrum of additional classifier strengths:\n\n| CG scale       |     Class accuracy  |\n| ------------------ | ------- | \n| w = 0.0            | 46.86 \\%  | \n| w = 1.0            | 87.44 \\% | \n| w = 2.0            | 96.26 \\% | \n| w = 4.0            | 99.16 \\% | \n\nNotice that as the classifier scale increases, the generated samples increasingly mirror their intended class-conditions, demonstrating the adaptable nature of our approach in accommodating supplementary guidance. We now included this point in our revision (Section D.9, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**W2.** Also, it would be better to discuss the rationale behind minority score \u2014 the exact motivation of having a minority data generation remains not elaborated.\n\nAs you may guess, the ability to generate minority data holds considerable importance in diverse real-world applications. For instance, it can enhance the predictive capabilities of medical diagnosis models by offering additional instances of rare conditions. Another noteworthy use-case pertains to fairness, as minority instances often align with social vulnerabilities. Augmenting their representations in the data can contribute to promoting fairness in various downstream applications. Moreover, unique features contained within low-likelihood instances are important in use-cases like creative AI applications [Ref-1], where the ability to generate samples with exceptional creativity is an essential component of the task. We now incorporated these points in our revised manuscript (the 1st paragraph in Section 1, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n[Ref-1] Rarity score: A new metric to evaluate the uncommonness of synthesized images, ICLR 2023."

                        "value": "We would like to express our sincere gratitude for providing useful comments, which indeed helped us to improve the manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses.\n\n---\n\n>**W1-1.** Evaluation: The baselines are limited to a few outdated works (StyleGAN 2020, DDPM 2020).\n\nThe reviewer is kindly reminded that as mentioned in Section C, the frameworks that we used for our diffusion baselines are actually ADM [Ref-1] (except for CIFAR-10 where IDDPM [Ref-2] was employed) which exhibit comparable performance to popular frameworks like LDM [Ref-3]. The reason we call such baselines as \u201cDDPM\u201d is to indicate that they employ ancestral sampler (which is often called \u201cthe DDPM sampling\u201d [Ref-4]) in the latent space. We now modified our manuscript to clarify this point (Section 4, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**W1-2.** The only recent baseline is by Sehwag 2022 on ImageNet which outperforms the proposed method in two out of four metrics.\n\nWhile the methodology presented by Sehwag et al. (2022) demonstrates a performance comparable to ours on ImageNet-64, a more expansive evaluation across diverse benchmarks reveals the overall superiority of our proposed approach. Specifically we found that our sampler yields better results than Sehwag et al. (2022) on CelebA; see the table below for details:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| BigGAN               | 80.41  | 16.51   | **0.97**  | 0.19  |\n| ADM [Ref-1]         | 75.05  | 16.73   | **0.97**   | 0.23  |\n| ADM-ML                | 51.66  | 13.04  | 0.94   | 0.31  |\n| Sehwag et al. (2022)              | 27.97  | 10.17  | 0.82  | **0.42**  |\n| Ours                              | **26.98**  | **8.23**  | 0.89  | 0.34  |\n\nFurthermore, our shortcomings in specific metrics (as exhibited in the results on ImageNet-64) are notably mitigated in the context of ImageNet-256, a more challenging (and often practically significant) benchmark than ImageNet-64. Below we exhibit the table for the comparison on ImageNet-256:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| ADM [Ref-1]                       | 17.41  | 12.85  | **0.87**  | 0.35  |\n| Sehwag et al. (2022)              | **13.43**  | 9.88  | 0.85 | 0.42  |\n| Ours                                  | 13.83  | **7.82**  | 0.85  | **0.45** |\n\n---\n\n>**W1-3.** All methods in Tab. 1 are evaluated for the minority generation task, which despite being old, outperform the proposed method in some metrics.\n\nWe would like to assure the reviewer that despite inferiorities in some metrics (like precision), our method works better in the holistic viewpoint as exhibited in the significant gain in comprehensive metrics (e.g., cFID), attaining better trade-offs between quality and diversity of low-density samples.\n\n---\n\n>**W1-4.** More recent methods, such as LDM [a], which is not even cited, can generate minority samples to some extent.\n\nThe reviewer is kindly reminded that LDM would exhibit similar performance to our baseline diffusion frameworks (e.g., ADM [Ref-1]) in generating minority instances, since the generation of LDM is also based on ancestral sampling (like ADM) that predominantly samples from high-density regions of data manifold (as claimed in [Ref-4]). To support this, we now conduct new experiments to compare ours with LDM; see the table below for instance:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| ADM [Ref-1]                    | 62.83 | 7.49 | 0.89  | 0.16  |\n| LDM [Ref-3]                     | 63.61  | 7.19  | **0.90** | 0.13  |\n| StyleGAN                          | 56.45  | **5.96**  | 0.87  | 0.13  |\n| Ours                                  | **41.52**  | 6.67  | 0.87  | **0.10**  |\n\nWe observe the same trend of our benefit, yielding significantly better holistic performance metrics compared to LDM. We now included these results in our revision (Table 1 in Section 4.2, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**W2.** Literature Review: The literature review is limited. There are many related methods that are not cited, contrasted against, or compared to:\n[a] Rombach, Robin, et al. \"High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models.\" CVPR 2022.\n[b] Huang, Gaofeng, and Amir Hossein Jafari. \"Enhanced balancing GAN: Minority-class image generation.\" Neural computing and applications 35.7 (2023): 5145-5154.\n[c] Samuel, Dvir, et al. \"Generating Images Of Rare Concepts Using Pretrained Diffusion Models. arXiv 2023.\n\nThanks for pointing out.

                        "value": ">**Q1.** The method is evaluated quantitatively for the minority image generation task. Doesn't it lead to loss of performance for generating long-tail data?\n\nAs you may guess, our quantitative evaluation is specifically tailored to assess the capability of producing minority instances, aligning with the primary objective of our study. Therefore, one may expect some level of performance loss in other high-density region. Nonetheless, the suspected performance loss was not observed in our sampler. Specifically when conditioned on all ranges of minority classes (uniformly at random), we found that the proposed sampler yields instances that are close to the ground truth data distribution compared to the standard diffusion sampler. See the table below for instance where we exhibit the performance values evaluated using the entire CelebA:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | \n| ADM [Ref-1]                          | 2.93 | 2.88  | \n| Ours                                  | **2.91**  | **2.86**  | \n\nWe see that our sampler yields better performance than the baseline DDPM sampler (on the ADM backbone), demonstrating its robustness against the potential performance loss in learning non-minority representations. We now included this point in our revision (Section D.8, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**Q2.** Were the minority samples only chosen based on the minority score? Did the authors perform any verification on whether they are all actually minorities? There are some samples shown for different minority scores, but I was wondering if there was a more systematic verification process or not.\n\nThe real minority samples used in our quantative evaluations are chosen based on existing low-density metrics such as AvgkNN. For instance, the results in Table 1 are evaluated with the most unique instances that yield the highest AvgkNN values. See Section C for more details. The validation of minority score as a low-density metric can be found in Section D.2; see details therein.\n\n---\n\n**References**\n\n[Ref-1] Diffusion models beat gans on image synthesis, NeurIPS 2021.\n\n[Ref-2] Improved denoising diffusion probabilistic models, ICML 2021.\n\n[Ref-3] High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models, CVPR 2022.\n\n[Ref-4] Generating High Fidelity Data from Low-density Regions using Diffusion Models, CVPR 2022."

                        "value": "We would like to thank your insightful and detailed comments, as well as your useful suggestions, which helped us to improve the manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses.\n\n--- \n\n>**W1.** The paper interchangeably uses the general term of diffusion models and assumes that the Tweedy formula is a general form of any diffusion model.\n\nWe agree that our alternating use of the two general terms (i.e., diffusion and score-based models) may confuse the readers. That said, it is true that the diffusion models and score-based approaches are equivalent to each other up to parameterization (VP vs VE SDE) as demonstrated by Song et al [Ref-1]. Furthermore, we would like to kindly remind the reviewer that Tweedie\u2019s formula is actually applicable to both VP-SDE (e.g., DDPM) and VE-SDE (e.g., Score-SDE) [Ref-2: DPS].\n\n---\n\n>**W2.** The author cited the paper, Sehwag, V., Hazirbas, C., Gordo, A., Ozgenel, F. and Canton, C., 2022. Generating high fidelity data from low-density regions using diffusion models. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 11492-11501). as a motivation \"The principle guarantees their generated samples to respect the (clean) data distribution, which naturally makes the sampler become majority-oriented, i.e., producing higher likelihood samples more frequently than lower likelihood ones (Sehwag et al., 2022),\" but in the cited paper, they claimed that uniform sampling is the problem, and changing the sampling process could introduce novel, or as authors phrased samples from \"long-tail\" part of the distribution: \"We observe that uniform sampling from diffusion models predominantly samples from high-density regions of the data manifold. Therefore, we modify the sampling process to guide it towards low-density regions while simultaneously maintaining the fidelity of synthetic data.\"\n\nBoth our paper and Sehwag\u2019s paper agree that the uniform sampling generates sample that follows the data distribution, which has more samples from high-density region. The reason we said it is a problem is that this does not favor to sample from minority regions, which we tried to overcome to generate minority samples.\n\n---\n\n>**W3-1.** The authors mentioned this baseline but only used it in one of the datasets, even though this work at least claimed that they tackled the problem of long-tailed distribution generation.\n\nThe reason we compare Sehwag et al. (2022) only in ImageNet is that their method was originally designed in the context of class-conditional settings. Nonetheless, to address your concern, we have extended Sehwag et al. (2022) into unconditional settings and compared the performance with ours. See below the table for instance where we provide comparison on CelebA:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| BigGAN        | 80.41  | 16.51   | **0.97**  | 0.19  |\n| DDPM         | 75.05  | 16.73   | **0.97**   | 0.23  |\n| DDPM-MLs          | 51.66  | 13.04  | 0.94   | 0.31  |\n| Sehwag et al.

(2022), demonstrating the advantage of ours as a minority generator. We now incorporated these results in our revision (Table 1 in Section 4.2, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**W3-2.** In addition, in that dataset, the results are in 64x64, whereas Sehwag et al. mentioned that they produced 256x256 images after upscaling from 64x64.\n\nAs per your suggestion, we now updated our ImageNet results with upscaling to 256 x 256. See below for our new results on ImageNet 256:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| ADM [Ref-1]                       | 17.41  | 12.85  | **0.87**  | 0.35  |\n| Sehwag et al.

Class-Balancing Diffusion Models. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 18434-18443).\n\nWe would like to first kindly remind the reviewer that while sharing similar aspects of encouraging minority representations, the method by Qin et al. (2023) is distinct from ours specifically in terms of the dataset setting where they require the use of minority class labels that are often expensive to obtain in practice. In that sense, we believe making a direct comparison with ours is not possible. Nonetheless, we have conducted new experiments to explore the gap between ours and the method by Qin et al. (2023). Specifically on a new dataset, CIFAR-10-LT, we compare our method with Qin et al. (2023) as well as with the standard DDPM sampler; see below the table for the results:\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| DDPM                             | 75.71  | 44.26  | **0.95**  | 0.23  |\n| Qin et al. (2023)                | 64.93  | **41.41**  | 0.92  | **0.36**  |\n| Ours                              | **63.34**  | 42.53  | **0.95**  | 0.24  |\n\nNotice that our sampler yields better (or comparable) performance than Qin et al. (2023), demonstrating the benefit of our method in boosting representations of minority instances without the help of related annotations. We now incorporated these new results in our revision (Table 7 in Section E.2, highlighted in blue).\n\n---\n\n>**Q1.** In Fig. 2, how the labels of small, moderate, and high minority scores are assigned in real data?\n\nFor the illustrations in Figure 2, we first measured the minority scores of all real samples (e.g., 50,000 training samples of CIFAR-10) via Eq. (7). The samples were then sorted based on their evaluated minority scores. We subsequently put instances yielding the lowest (highest) values of minority score in the left (right) column of Figure 2, while putting mid-level instances in the central column.\n\n---\n\n>**Q2.** In Proposition 1, could you please clarify what you mean by \"Assume that a given noise-conditioned score network s\u03b8(xt, t) have enough capacity?\" and how does it affect the proposed method?\n\nAs mentioned in the proof of Proposition 1 (in Section A.1), the assumption supports the achievability of the optimal score network, which guarantees Tweedie\u2019s formula (implemented using the score network) to exactly yield the posterior mean. Nonetheless, as already demonstrated in prior works [Ref-3], the posterior mean implemented with existing score architectures (e.g., U-Net) is sufficiently accurate to use for various applications [Ref-2,3], which corroborates with our results that exhibit the effectiveness of minority score in detecting low-likelihood instances (see Figures 2, 9, and 10 in our manuscript for instance). As a side note, most of the score method have the same assumption of the sufficient capacity to learn the score function.\n\n---\n\n>**Q3.** Why did not you evaluate CIFAR-LT which is seemingly designed for such a task? (Cao, K., Wei, C., Gaidon, A., Arechiga, N. and Ma, T., 2019. Learning imbalanced datasets with label-distribution-aware margin loss. Advances in neural information processing systems, 3)\n\nAs per your great suggestion, we now conduct new experiments on CIFAR-10-LT to further investigate the performance of ours. See the table below where we exhibit the performance of ours compared to a new baseline, the method by Qin et al. (2023). To measure the closeness to minorities in the long-tailed benchmark, we employ the most unique instances as baseline real data for computing the metrics (i.e., the same way of evaluation as in our manuscript):\n\n| Method                           | cFID   | sFID   | Prec  | Rec   |\n| -------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |\n| DDPM                             | 75.71  | 44.26  | **0.95**  | 0.23  |\n| Qin et al. (2023)                | 64.93  | **41.41**  | 0.92  | **0.36**  |\n| Ours                              | **63.34**  | 42.53  | **0.95**  | 0.24  |\n\nWe see that our sampler performs better (or comparable) than the considered baselines, demonstrating the robustness aspect of ours that persists even under a challenging long-tailed setting. We now incorporated these new results in our revision (Table 7 in Section E.2, highlighted in blue)."

We have **extended the comparison** against Sehwag et al. (2022) on other settings like CelebA and ImageNet-256. We also incorporated the baseline that the reviewer suggested (i.e., Qin et al. (2023)).\n2. We included experiments on an **additional benchmark** that the reviewer pointed out (i.e., CIFAR-10-LT). The results highlight that the performance benefit of our approach persists even on challenging long-tailed data.\n3. We have clarified that there are **no remaining ethical issues** in the use of our brain MRI dataset, since it has received **IRB approval** and is not accessible to the public. We highlighted that we already mentioned this point in Ethical Statement in our submitted manuscript.\n\nWe would like to gently remind you that the **end of the discussion period is imminent**. We would appreciate it if you could let us know whether our comments addressed your concerns.\n\nBest regards, Authors."

The reason we said it is a problem is that this does not favor to sample from minority regions, which we tried to overcome to generate minority samples.\""
