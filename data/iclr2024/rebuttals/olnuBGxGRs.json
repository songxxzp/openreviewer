The dataset included ECG episodes identified as pauses by an existing ICM system, which were subsequently manually labeled as true pauses or false pauses by annotators. The resulting CNN achieved an AUC of 0.9942 and an accuracy of 96.63%."

                    "value": "- The methodology employed by the authors lacks novelty, as it follows the standard process of applying deep learning methodologies to address a specific task. \n\n- The authors' review of related works appears to be insufficient. The reference section includes only 10 papers, which seems inadequate given the paper's length. Related works should encompass topics such as applying machine learning methods to ECG data from ICM devices, ECG pause detection algorithms, and other related areas.\n\n- The implementation details lack sufficient explanation. To enable the reproduction of the experiments, specific aspects need further elaboration, including the size of the input data, the learning rate employed, the architecture of the models under comparison, the type of augmentation applied, and other relevant parameters.\n\n- The organization of the paper requires improvement.\n  - The labeling process, currently explained in the discussion section, appears more suitable for the dataset description rather than a discussion item.\n  - There are duplicate sentences present on both page 3 and page 6 (Moreover, increasing the size of the training dataset \u2026\u2026 deep learning-based ECG analysis).\n  - There is a caption duplication issue where the caption for Figure 2 is the same as that of Figure 3.\n\n- The arguments by the authors appear to lack supporting evidence.\n  - \u201cIn summary, data augmentation is more commonly applied and tends to have more pronounced impact on convolutional neural networks due to their ability to capture spatial relationships and patterns in image data\u201d on page 4: the authors should conduct comprehensive experiments that encompass various augmentation schemes and widely-used model architectures.\n  - \u201cWith fewer parameters to learn, the custom CNN may be less prone to overfitting the training data and therefore have improved generalization capabilities\u201d on page 5: The authors should experiment with networks of varying sizes and provide evidence to demonstrate that their selected network size is appropriate for this specific task."

                    "value": "- The data used in the experiments is the collection of ECG episodes that were predicted as pause episodes by an existing ICM system. Why did the authors choose to develop a backup system for an existing algorithm, rather than directly addressing the pause detection problem using raw ECG signals? If a high-performing CNN can be directly applied to detect pause episodes from raw ECG data, it would eliminate the need for an extra step. Are there any practical reasons for this approach?\n\n- To fully understand the task, it is essential to explain how an episode is defined. What is the duration of a single episode? Is it an ECG signal containing a brief pause within it? Providing a more detailed description of the task's input would be beneficial.\n\n- How crucial are Sensitivity and Specificity in the context of this study? Which is more important: minimizing false positives or minimizing false negatives for achieving the goal of the proposed task?"
