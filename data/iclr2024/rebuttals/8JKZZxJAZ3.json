The approach gives a closed-form solution to a special case of NMF where the factors are orthogonal and provides a deterministic optimal solution to another special case of NMF where the data is close to the cone formed by the NCEs.  The authors also claimed to provide an improved initialization for classical NMF algorithms in general."

There are significant exaggerated statements in this submission, and it appears the authors are not well-versed in the literature on NMF.\n\n- In the first paragraph of page 2, the authors claim that \"In doing so, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first ONMF method with global guarantees, thus answering an over 20-year-old open question.\" This claim appears to be unaware of the seminal work (Arora et al., 2012) and it follow-up works such as (Asteris et al., 2015) and (Charikar & Hu, 2021), which provide global guarantees for NMF or ONMF methods. Moreover, for such a claim, I would expect to see some recovery bounds (for the inexact case) or formal proofs for the global optimality. However, I cannot find any theoretical guarantee in this submission.   \n\nArora, S., Ge, R., Kannan, R., & Moitra, A. (2012, May). Computing a nonnegative matrix factorization--provably.

PMLR.\n\n- The authors claim in the abstract that \"NCEs provide an improved initialization for classical NMF algorithms in general\". But their limited and weak experiments on synthetic data are clearly not sufficient to support this claim. \n\n2. This submission is written in a terrible form. For example:\n\n- The first paragraph of **Contributions** is confusing and lacks precise definitions of key concepts. It would be more effective to defer the detailed discussion of these concepts to later sections and summarize the main contributions concisely.\n\n- The authors are unable to provide a mathematical characterization or experimental evidence to substantiate the strength of the canonical inclusion property (CIP), and the concepts introduced in the paper (NCEs and CIP) do not appear practically relevant to me."

These NCEs are intersections of the principal subspace containing the data to be factored with canonical faces of the nonnegative orthant. Through this lens, the proposed approach yields a closed-form solution to the special NMF case where (at least one of) the factors are required to be orthogonal. In the general NMF case, NCEs provide a deterministic optimal solution whenever the data resides within or in proximity to the cone formed by the NCEs. Furthermore, NCEs provide an improved initialization for classical NMF methods in general."
