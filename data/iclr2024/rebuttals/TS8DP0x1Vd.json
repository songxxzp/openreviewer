This method is applied to a 3D CNN model trained to predict chronological age from brain maps of volume and stiffness computed from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and T1-weighted magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) scans, respectively."

Are the solutions obtained by the decomposition unique? If not- how does this affect the interpretability of the factors?\n\n3. Can such methods be extended to non-convolutional architectures and non-spatially contiguous input data, for example graph neural networks"
