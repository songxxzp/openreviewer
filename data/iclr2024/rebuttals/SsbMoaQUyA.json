                    "value": "The paper studied the task of updating an LLM with new knowledge. The proposed method turns a corpus containing new information into instruction (question) and response pairs ready for fine-tuning. Existing LLM is used to do this task. Authors argue that existing LLM has a tendency of using previously trained knowledge than the new one, aka exposure bias. The proposed solution is to repeat the relevant new content before answering the question in model-generated fine-tuning data.\n\nExperiments are done with an instruction-tuned LLAMA-7B and two new corpora (CNN, NQ). Model-based evaluation showed that the proposed method outperforms the baseline model and simple fine-tuning (adding facts directly and adding q&a pairs without repeating the new facts). To see how the model would forget old knowledge after fine-tuning, experiments with different sizes of samples from existing instruction tuning sets are done, which shows that even a small set of old instructions can prevent significant forgetting."

                    "value": "Reviewer orders the concerns by their importance.\n\n- Probably a wrong assumption about the limits of incorporating new information into an old model's response. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a widely-adopted practice now, as seen in ChatGPT's browser-plugin and Google Bard. It can equip the models with fresh information without the need of retraining. The assumption made in Section 4 paragraph #3, \"However, it is impossible to maintain an infinitely large memory to store the new information\" is not really a problem given modern search engines / information retrieval techniques.\n\n- The hypothesis of exposure bias is not properly validated. Higher evaluation numbers of context-aware fine-tuning data over facts and facts+naive are not a sufficient proof that exposure bias exists. Reviewer suggests either design a more direct experiments at exposure bias, or do detailed analysis of the wins/losses between the results of different methods to show that the differences are indeed caused by exposure bias.\n\n- Model-based evaluation is less convincing. All evaluations in the experiments are based on models. Reviewer thinks it's important to look at the results, either by human raters or with human analysis, to make sure the differences are not caused by the model's bias.\n\n- Evaluation lacks confidence intervals. Some of the differences are quite narrow, e.g. in NQ. The CNN set only has ~300 evaluation prompts (smaller). The evaluator itself is a model. All the factors call for a confidence interval on all numbers to make sure they are statistically significant.\n\n- Poor writing. Spelling errors and non-sense characters possibly from lack of proof-reading are common."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "Here are some detailed questions/suggestions.\n\nFirst of all, there are numerous simple writing errors and misspellings. E.g. \n\n- Last paragraph in Section 1, \"Additionally, we perform an additional study\", only one \"additional\" is needed. \n- Section 1 last paragraph last sentence (before \"To summarize\"). It's too long to be understandable.\n- Second claim at the end of Section 1: what is \"mbbvpropose\"?\n- Definition 2.4. \"Informtaion\"?\n- Right before Equation 5, what is \"vcvc?\"\n\nReviewer will not try to enumerate all of them. Some professional proofreading is needed (maybe using an LLM to help spell check, at least?)\n\nOther non-writing related questions\n\n- Please explain any new math notions when they first appear. E.g. section 2.2 first paragraph, X_T? Or in Definition 2.4 I_s(C)?\n\n- Right after Definition 2.3, the \"here P(r|A,i,T)\", it doesn't match anything in Equation (3).\n\n- Equation 7 is very confusing. What do you mean by indicator function and what do they do here?\n\n- Table 1: adding the new prefix in the response will effectively change the model's output. Do you mean we will need to do post processing from then on?\n\n- Page 5 footnote 1. Not clear what the authors are doing.\n\n- Section 4 2nd paragraph. GPT-4 has 170 trillion parameters? That's a trillion with a T.  What is the source of information?"

                        "value": "Thanks for the review. Regarding the reviewer\u2019s concern that the updating problem is not important since retrieval augmentation can be potentially done on infinitely large corpus, our arguments are \nTraditional tf-idf based retrievers (e.g., BM25) typically have inferior performance, while neural retrievers also need updating in essence. Moreover, even tf-idf based retrievers are very slow for very large corpus, and neural retrievers are even slower.\nAs the example of Chat-GPT that the reviewer mentioned, it is worth noticing that Chat-GPT is also regularly updated with new training data. Its knowledge cutoff date was just updated to April 2023. We hope this fact can alleviate the reviewer\u2019s concern on the lack of importance of this problem. We are happy to have further discussion over this concern,\n\nWeakness 2. We agree with the reviewer\u2019s concern. We have provided a case study in the appendix that is related to the reviewer\u2019s suggestion\n\nWeakness 3, we acknowledge that the model-based evaluation is not perfect, yet it outperforms traditional automatic metrics in terms of the alignment with human preferences. The reviewer also suggested human rating, however the cost of huma evaluation is an important factor under consideration. We are considering doing a small scale human evaluation on a subset of the evaluation data to demonstrate the consistency of the model scores and human ratings. We will keep you posted about the progress.\n\nWeakness 4 (lacking confidence interval), we actually put it in the appendix to save space. \nFor the reviewers\u2019 question 1,we have added the explanation of X_T which is the set of related text sequences.\nFor the reviewer's confusion on the notation I_S(C) in definition 2.4, actually definition 2.4 is defining I_S(C). We have made this clearer.\nFor reviewr\u2019s question on the indicator function, for a logical statement p(x), an indicator function I(p(x)) takes the value of 1 if p(x) is true otherwise 0. \nQ4, we mentioned in section 3.5 that we did automatic post-processing. \nQ5, the footnote says that  the question is repeated in the response during training due to potential left truncation limited by the maximum sequence length. \nQ6, this is a typo. It should be 1.7T. \nAlso, thanks to the reviewer for pointing out typos. We have fixed the typos."

The reviewer\u2019s question on Figure 2(a) is a very interesting question that we are also investigating after the submission of this work. Although this investigation is still in progress, our current understanding is that in addition to the size,  the selection and the training order of the replay samples seem to be important for quality of learning. Our observation is that when the samples are not arranged properly, the model tends to learn negative associations (connect evaluation questions to unrelated information). However, it is worth mentioning that we focus more on the challenge of exposure bias during updating for this work .We believe our ongoing work will provide a better understanding of the question the reviewer poses."

                    "value": "This work addresses the problem of continual fine-tuning of LLMs using new training corpora. In contrast to previous approaches that involve significant human effort in converting unstructured data into more structured data to make the best use of new training corpora in fine-tuning LLMs, this work attempts to eliminate the human involvement in the process. It proposes a self information updating task for LLMs that makes use of unstructured new training corpora in the fine-tuning of LLMs without requiring human editorial intervention. The self information updating task is formulated as a self-distillation task with the LLM as the teacher and the new training corpora as the context. Specifically, this consists of first generating instruction response pairs from the new training corpora by using the LLM and then using the resulting pairs for fine-tuning. However, this naive approach is plagued by the issue of exposure bias where existing information from LLM is prioritized over the novel information in the new training corpora. This issue is identified and analyzed theoretically and it is noted that the bias affects both response generation and probability of instructions. \n\nThe work proposes a heuristic for mitigating exposure bias. The key idea is to do a context-aware distillation which is essentially identifying the source of the instruction (new corpus or pretraining corpus) and making use of only probability terms that are relevant for the source. Given a training triple (i, r, d), where d is the article from the new corpus from which the LLM generated the instruction-response pair (i, r), the model is forced, during finetuning, to learn to generate d from i and then r from (d, i). Here d serves as the context for i to the LLM for generating i. \n\nThe work presents results from experiments on two datasets - CNN News and NQ Val. The first data set consists of a small news corpus (50 CNN news articles from the period March and April 2023) with a resulting evaluation set of 301 instruction-response pairs generated using GPT-4. The NQ Val data set consists of extracted paragraphs from Wikipedia pages (long answers for questions in the validation split of the Natural Questions benchmark) with an evaluation set consisting of questions and short answers. As the baseline an instruction-following model from the LLaMA-7B fine tuned with instruction-following data from Alpaca and InstructionWild is used. (Of these, a randomly sampled 300 instruction-response pairs is used as old data.) The work answer consistency and context consistency as the metrics for evaluating the proposed approach as well as the baseline. Experimental study reveals that the proposed approach produces significant improvement over the baseline on both metrics for instruction-response pairs from new corpus while giving marginally negative improvement for instruction-response pairs from the instruction fine-tuning corpus. In contrast, a combination of principled but subject to exposure bias methods (namely, Fact + Naive) gives slightly lower improvement for instruction-response pairs from new corpus while not degrading performance on instruction-response pairs from the instruction fine-tuning corpus."

Dropping completely probability terms based on context (to get Equation 7 from Equation 5) no doubt prioritizes novel information in the new training corpus over existing information from LLM for instruction-response pairs generated from the new corpus. But this also affects the model's performance on old instruction-response pairs as evident from Table 2. A possibly better approach is to use all the terms in Equation 5 but with source dependent weight that is determined by hyperparameter tuning. \n\n2. While the idea of generating instruction-response pairs from LLM for new corpus is interesting and eliminates the need for human effort, it is also a potentially problematic issue as current LLMs are known to hallucinate and as a consequence the instruction-response pairs could be affected by it."

                    "value": "1. In Table 2, the answer consistency score of Context-aware is significantly higher than that of the baseline for new corpus. This is very encouraging indeed. However, the performance of  Context-aware on new corpus is significantly lower than that of the baseline for Old (0.480 vs 0.699 for CNN News and 0.256 vs 0.699 for NQ Val). What explains this gap and what can be possibly done to reduce it?  \n\n2. In Table 2, the answer consistency score of the baseline for Old is nearly the same for both data sets (CNN News:0.696 and NQ Val:0.691). In contrast, Context-aware seems to be doing significantly better on CNN News than on NQ Val (0.480 vs 0.256). What explains this gap and what can be possibly done to reduce it? \n\n3. How many instruction-response pairs are in NQ Val and how many are used in evaluation?\n\n4. From Figure 2.a it appears that some forgetting is inevitable in the proposed approach and increasing the no of replay examples doesn't really help alleviate this problem beyond a point. One wonders if forgetting will become more severe when fine tuning is done continually and with more datasets than the two used in the experimental studies. Figure 2.b seems to indicating this (score for old reduces further when the model already fine-tuned with NQ Val is further fine tuned with CNN News). What can be possibly done to address this issue?"

                        "value": "Thanks for recognizing the importance of the problem and the effectiveness of our method. Regarding the reviewer\u2019s question on Table 2 (Q1 and Q2)., we have two observations. Firstly, on the CNN news corpus where the evaluation QA pairs are generated based on the information updating corpus, the context consistency score is close to the score on old instructions. Note that the reason we report context consistency is that sometimes the GPT-4 generated answers are brief and more detailed answers generated by our model are penalized for additional details.Therefore we think in the case of CNN News the performance gap is actually small. For NQ Val, we believe the reason lies in the different approach to create the dataset. In NQ, questions are first created without referring to the corpus. Then annotators try to associate relevant wikipedia articles to the questions. This might lead to some challenging cases where more complex reasoning is required to use the information in the document to answer the question. Moreover, we filter our questions where the base model without fine-tuning achieves higher scores in NQ Val, which makes the remaining questions more probable to be challenging questions. In general, we believe this is a good question and deserve deeper investigation.\n\nRegarding the reviewer\u2019s Q3, there are 8k examples in the original validation set. We remove those with empty answers and those the base model achieves high scores without fine-tuning, resulting in 1382 examples. Many examples are filtered because LLaMA is very likely to have been pre-trained on Wikipedia pages.\n\nFor Q4, we have a similar understanding of the forgetting problem as the reviewer. For the scope of this paper, we focus more on the quality of updates and the experiments on the continual setting serves as an initial exploration in the forgetting problem. Also the continual experiments shows that our method\u2019s requirements on the replay tokens is potentially smaller than traditional fine-tuning methods."

                        "value": "Thanks for recognizing the importance of the problem and the effectiveness of our method. Regarding the reviewer\u2019s question on the different with model editing, existing methods typically use human-curated corpus for editing, where the knowledge to edit is carefully cleaned into either triples or simple sentences containing the fact  (e.g., [2307.12976] Evaluating the Ripple Effects of Knowledge Editing in Language Models (arxiv.org)). In this work, we try to avoid human involvement in the process and perform updating on raw text. For the connection with continual learning, the setting of this work is a subset of continual learning focusing on the information in the corpus. This is also the reason why we evaluate with QA pairs querying the information in the updating corpus instead of using perplexities for evaluation. We have a more brief discussion in the current related work section. The above explanation is also related to the reviewer\u2019s concern over the evaluation using factual consistency and the QA task in weakness 2.\n\nRegarding the reviewer\u2019s confusion on the meaning of $x$ after equation 1, we shift to an input-output (i,r) format for language modeling because our experiments are conducted for instruction-following models. We have added more explanations to avoid the confusion. The reason we use instruction-following models is due to the difficulty of evaluating information acquisition using QA pairs for base models without instruction-following abilities. Moreover,  We would like to point out that in auto-regressive language models, language modeling can also be rewritten in an input-output format P(x_(1:n+m)) = P(x_(1:n)P(x_(n+1:n+m)|x_(1:n)) by picking an arbitrary breakpoint. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any further concerns and confusions."
