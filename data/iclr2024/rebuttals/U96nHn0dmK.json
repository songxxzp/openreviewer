Comparative experiments reveal that this technique outperforms both one-shot and iterative pruning methods, particularly in highly sparse subnetworks. Moreover, the method demonstrates its versatility by improving the performance of subnetwork ensembles by applying the stochastic subnetwork annealing to the Prune and Tune Ensembling strategy, yielding superior performance compared to benchmark methods such as FreeTickets and Dense Ensembling."

                    "value": "(1) Overall, I think the novelty is somewhat limited. The main contribution of this paper is to use randomness to the binary mask to prune the network, which is highly similar to dropout. Note that there exist papers that utilize dropout for network sparsification [1], and performance improvement due to such randomness is somewhat trivial (as various dropout papers highlighted [2,3])\n\n(2) The overall improvement is marginal. The main baseline is to improve iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), but as shown in Table 1 (the final two tables), the improvement is quite marginal, e.g., 0.564 to 0.566. Furthermore, I think it is not important to improve iterative random pruning or random pruning since IMP is the most important baseline. Finally, it would be great if the author could consider combining other pruning schemes with the proposed method, e.g., [4,5,6].\n\n(3) It would be great to include large-scale datasets as network pruning frameworks sometimes show the inconsistency of trends when scaling to high-resolution images [7]. I think it would be great if the author could show ImageNet, but Tiny-ImageNet or sub-sampled ImageNet would also be great.\n\n(4) For weight pruning experiments, it is good to show the pruned results as follows (examples: Figure 2 of [4] or Table 2 of [8]).\n- The initial accuracy and the best accuracy (as it sometimes improves the performance) \n- Variance of the result (as pruning, highly depends on the initialization). Especially, as the current improvement is marginal, it would be great to add the variance by running multiple times with different random seeds.\n\n(5) Can the author explain why this method shows better robustness than other ensemble methods? I think there is no component that forces robustness in the suggested method. \n\n(6) More rigorous experiments on various architecture is required. \n- The author only considers Wide-ResNet for the main experiments and considers ResNet for the ablation study (which is also a little inconsistent).\n- Network pruning should be tested under various architectures to ensure consistency. \n\n(7) minor: Editorial comment.\n- The background section consists of various literature. It will be much better to divide the subsection (or use a subsubsection) to group similar backgrounds together.\n- Missing citation in Section 5.2 (third paragraph)\n\n[1] Variational Dropout Sparsifies Deep Neural Networks, ICML 2017\\\n[2] Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting, JMLR 2014\\\n[3] Variational Dropout and the Local Reparameterization Trick, NeurIPS 2015\\\n[4] Layer-adaptive sparsity for the Magnitude-based Pruning, ICLR 2021\\\n[5] A Signal Propagation Perspective for Pruning Neural Networks at Initialization, ICLR 2020\\\n[6] Movement Pruning: Adaptive Sparsity by Fine-Tuning, NeurIPS 2020\\\n[7] Sparse Training via Boosting Pruning Plasticity with Neuroregeneration, NeurIPS 2021\\\n[8] Training Your Sparse Neural Network Better with Any Mask, ICML 2022"

It is claimed that this approach allows for more robust optimization and ultimately better performance."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "At a high level, it's unclear to me what this paper accomplishes. It does not offer new insights about pruning, nor does it permit more efficient model inference or training in practice. Accuracy gains over other pruning methods are claimed, but they are fairly marginal, leaving me unconvinced that this is even useful as a proof of concept, in the way that e.g. the original lottery ticket hypothesis paper was.\n\nMore specifically:\n> However, these models also bring important challenges related to computational needs, storage cost, and training efficiency. The resource-intensive nature of these large networks have spurred a growing interest in techniques that can reduce the size and computational complexity associated with training and deploying these models.\n\n- This sentence from the introduction seems to promise a method that improves the efficiency of practical large models. Like other pruning papers, this one does not provide that. As the authors note themselves, translating unstructured sparsity into efficiency or reduced complexity in practice is very difficult, if not impossible, with current tools. Also, this paper does not evaluate SSA on models at a scale that would benefit from shrinking in practice.\n\n> The probabilistic inclusion of extra parameters early in the tuning process allows for gradient information to bleed through into the target subnetwork, encouraging robust adaptation and avoiding the drastic performance collapse observed with one-shot pruning methods.\n\n> Allowing other parameters to become active allows for gradient information to contribute to optimization of the target subnetwork which can help to encourage avoidance of local minima\n\n- Several claims (^) of this nature are made, but as far as I can tell there is little evidence in the paper to support them. There are no robustness evaluations, as far as I can tell, and avoiding the drastic performance collapse of one-shot pruning is not unique to SSA.\n\n- Table 1 should have full-network accuracy on it. It should also ideally have error bars, since the margins are so slim. Would also be nice to see CIFAR-10 results here, to allow for easier comparison to canonical papers in the field, like the lottery ticket hypothesis paper.\n\n- Table 2 claims that SSA requires fewer FLOPs than some competing methods, but this is not particularly meaningful, in that the method does not actually translate into improved performance on existing ML hardware (right?). Alternatively, one could argue that the burden of having to keep around float matrices of probabilities the same size as the network also outweighs theoretical improvements to FLOP counts, since practical models most in need of being pruned are now tens or even hundreds of gigabytes. \n\n- The differences between SSA and regular Prune and Tune in Table 2 seem far too close to call for me. I'd need to see error bars here as well.\n\nBits and bobs (no bearing on decision):\n- There's a missing citation (marked by a ?) on page 8."
