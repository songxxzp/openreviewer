The key challenge of this fair domain generalization problem is to deal with multiple potential sensitive attributes and any combinations of sensitive attributes can appear in the unseen testing domains. Then it presented a feasible solution by learning the domain-invariant representation and sensitive attribute invariant representation from training domains. The objective function included four components: domain-invariance loss, fairness-aware invariance loss, classification loss, and equalized odds (for fairness) loss. Experiments on two real-world data sets showed that the proposed outperformed DG baselines in terms of generalization and fairness."

It was a much more challenging problem setting than previous work due to the complicated interconnections of different sensitive attributes. The major technical novelty of this paper was to selectively learn the invariant representation based on the sensitive attributes, e.g., generate representations with respect to sensitive attributes. Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed SISA method over several baselines in terms of both generalization and fairness metrics.\n\n**Quality:** The fair domain generalization problem was well-defined. The motivating example in Figure 1 also illustrated that fair domain generalization with multiple sensitive attributes was a challenging yet practical problem. In the derived objective function, both generalization performance and fairness were encouraged in different loss terms.\n\n**Clarity:** Overall, the presentation of this paper was clear and the derived problem was well-motivated. Experiments also showed the training procedures and evaluation metrics for performance comparison between the proposed method and baselines. Ablation studies supported that the hyper-parameters were relatively robust to the model performance.\n\n**Significance:** This paper extended previous fair domain generalization to a more general setting where multiple sensitive attributes could appear in different domains."

The proposed SISA approach involves several techniques from previous works, e.g., invariant representation learning with domain density translators, equalized odds loss, contrastive loss, etc. The major technical contributions could be emphasized in the context of the derived fair domain generalization problem.\n\n**W2:** The explanation of the fairness encoder in subsection 3.2.1 is not convincing. (1) It randomly chooses a single $c$ to learn the representations of sensitive attributes. This can lead to biased and unstable solutions. More empirical evaluations on this sampling strategy can be provided. (2) It uses the concatenation between input $x$ and attribute $c$. However, if $x$ (e.g., high-dimensional images) and $c$ differ in dimensionality, would the concatenated vector be dominated by one of them? \n\n**W3:** The equalized odds loss $\\mathcal{L}_{EO}$ is confusing. What are $h\\_{\\psi}(z | y, i)$ and $h\\_{\\psi}(z | y, j)$ over the sample $(x, y) \\sim \\mathcal{P}\\_d$? What is $\\mathcal{P}$ within $Div(\\cdot)$? Why does it involve both $\\mathbb{E}\\_{(x,y)\\sim \\mathcal{P}_d}$ and $\\mathbb{E}\\_{y \\sim \\mathcal{Y}}$?\n\n**W4:** The hyper-parameter setting is not explained. (1) It shows that $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega= 1$ are used in previous work for the best reported results, and thus those parameters are also used in this paper.  However, since different models are involved in this paper and previous work, $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega= 1$ might lead to sub-optimal solutions.

We address their queries below.**\n\n> 1) The technical novelties of this paper are unclear. The proposed SISA approach involves several techniques from previous works. The major technical contributions could be emphasized in the context of the derived fair domain generalization problem.\n\nWe thank Reviewer 4 for the suggestion and have revised our paper elucidating our contribution better. \n\n***\n>2) a) Fairness encoder randomly chooses a single $\\mathbf{c}$ to learn the representations of sensitive attributes. This can lead to biased and unstable solutions. More empirical evaluations on this sampling strategy can be provided. \n\n+ Initially, we had trained the model on all $\\mathbf{c}$ $\\in \\mathcal{C}$ during each iteration. We found that it increased the training complexity. Then, we sampled a $\\frac{1}{3}$ number of  $\\mathbf{c}$'s from $\\mathcal{C}$ during each training iteration and found that it did not compromise the stability of the training. Even though in the algorithm we wrote it as sampling a single $\\mathbf{c}$ in each iteration, in practice we sampled multiple $\\mathbf{c}$'s in each iteration eventually reaching $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the total elements in $\\mathcal{C}$. We provide our code for a better understanding of our algorithm.\n\n> b)  Fairness encoder uses the concatenation between input $\\mathbf{x}$  and attribute $\\mathbf{c}$. However, if $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{c}$ differ in dimensionality, would the concatenated vector be dominated by one of them?\n\n+ $\\mathbf{c}$ is a binary vector of size $n$x$1$. We reshape it to $256$x$256$x$1$ by repeating its values over dimensions 1 and 2 and adding a 3rd dimension. Then it is concatenated to input $\\mathbf{x}$ as an additional channel. So the total dimension of the input becomes ($\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c} = $ $256$x$256$x$2$ for MIMIC CXR and $256$x$256$x$4$ for CelebA). $\\mathbf{c}$ will not dominate $\\mathbf{x}$ as variation between different $\\mathbf{c}$'s is much lower than variations between different $\\mathbf{x}$'s.\n\n***\n\n> 3) The equalized odds loss $L_{EO}$ is confusing. What are $h_\\psi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid y,i)$ and $h_\\psi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid y,j)$ over the sample $(\\mathbf{x},y) \\sim P_d$? What is P within Div()? Why does it involve both $\\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{x},y)} \\sim P_d$ and $\\mathbb{E}_y \\sim Y$?\n\n$\\mathbf{z}$ denotes the latent representation of $\\mathbf{x}$ obtained through the fairness encoder $f_\\phi$ and generalization encoder $g_\\theta$ (Eq 3 and 6 from the paper). Hence even though the operation is on $\\mathbf{z}$ inside $h_\\psi$, it is a function of the training data $\\mathbf{x}$ which is sampled from $(\\mathbf{x},y) \\sim P_d$. We have simplified $L_{EO}$ for better readability below.\n\n$L_{EO} = \\mathbb{E}\\_{d \\sim D} \\mathbb{E}\\_{(\\mathbf{x}, y) \\sim P_d}\\mathbb{E}\\_{y \\in Y} \\mathbb{E}\\_{i,j \\in \\mathcal{I}\\_\\mathbf{c}} ((h_\\psi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid y, i) - (h_\\psi(\\mathbf{z} \\mid y, j))^2$\n\n***\n\n> 4) a) The hyper-parameter setting shows that $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega=1$ are used in previous work for the best-reported results, and thus those parameters are also used in this paper. However, since different models are involved in this paper and previous work, $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega=1$ might lead to sub-optimal solutions.\n\nWe chose to use the best-reported hyperparameter values $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega=1$ for both the baseline and our model in order to have a fair comparison between the models. We understand the comments of the reviewer about tuning $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega=1$ for the baselines and our models, but we are unable to do so at the moment. However, we would like to highlight that despite tuning for the best values of $\\alpha=0.1, \\omega=1$, we were still able to achieve good performance from our model for the given values of hyperparameters.\n\n> b) The hyper-parameter sensitivity on $\\epsilon$ and $\\gamma$ are analyzed. However, it is unclear whether the best hyper-parameters are selected based on the testing domains. Is any validation method adopted for hyper-parameter selection during training?\n\nThe hyperparameter values are chosen based on the highest accuracy on the validation set. However, for the ablation studies, we have reported their respective accuracies obtained on the test set."

This might indicate that it becomes more challenging to find the trade-off between generalization performance and fairness when increasing the number of sensitive attributes. Therefore, it would be better to provide some insights into understanding how to balance generalization performance and fairness when a large number of sensitive attributes exist.\n\n###### Our ablation studies in Tables 4, 5, and 6 of the paper show that our model's hyperparameters $\\epsilon$ and $\\gamma$ can be varied to manage the trade-off between fairness and accuracy quantitatively. For CelebA dataset, with the highest no of sensitive attributes ($4$), we noticed slightly better results for performance when $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ values are high and fairness when $\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ are low.\n\n***\n\n> 6) Table 7 shows that the number of encoders can also affect the trade-off between performance and fairness. Why does a single encoder improve the fairness and multiple encoders help generalization performance in the proposed approach?\n\n###### In the case of a single-encoder model, a single representation $\\mathbf{z}$ denotes the fairness and the generalization information. Hence, it is implicitly equally divided among the loss for the $n$ sensitive attribute ($L_{DF}$) and the generalization loss ($L_{DG}$). As there are $n$ sensitive attributes, it overshadows the generalization information due to being the same representation. \n\n###### In the case of two-encoders model, where one encoder stands for fairness and the other for generalization performance, $\\mathbf{z}$ is explicitly split between $\\mathbf{z}_g$ and $\\mathbf{z}_f$, giving $\\mathbf{z}_g$ a good enough representation in $\\mathbf{z}$ and not get overshadowed by $\\mathbf{z}_f$. Hence, the generalization performance (accuracy) is better with two encoders. \n\n***\n\n> 7) This paper considers the covariate shift among domains.

                    "value": "- The clarity of the paper is lacking, with several important details omitted. For instance, the paper lacks comprehensive information about the training of the domain density translator $G'$ for fairness generalization. Training $G'$ is not straightforward due to the varying sensitive attributes across different datasets.\n\n- The design choice of using a shared translator $G'$ for all sensitive attributes appears questionable. Notably, given an input $X$ from domain $d$, $G'$ only generates $X' = G'(X, d, d')$ in domain $d'$, without considering which sensitive attributes are relevant to the translation. This implies that the model assumes $P_d(X|y,s) = P_{d'}(X'|y,s)$ and $P_d(X|y,s') = P_{d'}(X'|y,s')$ for every $s, s' \\in S$, which is a strong assumption and may not hold in practical scenarios.\n\n- The rationale behind learning distinct representations for each sensitive attribute is not well elucidated. Why is it necessary for the model to minimize the gap between domain representations with the same sensitive attribute configurations while maximizing the gap for those with different sensitive attributes? How does concatenating all representations contribute to accurate and fair predictions in target domains?\n\n- The results in Table 2 and 3 seem to be presented for a fixed value of $\\gamma$. It would be more comprehensive if the authors varied $\\gamma$ to explore the accuracy-fairness trade-off for the methods used in the experiments.\n\n- The final objective, as defined in Equation (10), encompasses a blend of multiple loss components. I recommend that the authors carry out an ablation study, varying hyperparameters, to assess the impact of each loss on the model's performance.\n\n- The technical novelty of the paper appears somewhat limited. The primary contribution appears to be the utilization of distinct representations for each sensitive attribute.\n\n- In the introduction section (Fig. 1), the authors assert that the proposed method can accommodate the heterogeneity of sensitive attributes across domains. However, in the experimental section, the models seem to have access to all sensitive attributes in all domains, which may contradict the initial claim.\n\n- The paper lacks the provision of code and supplementary documentation, which could significantly enhance clarity and reproducibility. Providing these resources would be beneficial for the reader to understand and replicate the methodology."

We post responses to their queries below.**\n\n> 1) The clarity of the paper is lacking, with several important details omitted. For instance, the paper lacks comprehensive information about the training of the domain density translator $G'$ for fairness generalization. Training $G'$ is not straightforward due to the varying sensitive attributes across different datasets.\n\nWe have added more details about the training of $G'$ in the supplementary section of the revised version of the paper.\n\n***\n> 2) The design choice of using a shared translator $G'$ for all sensitive attributes appears questionable. Notably, given an input $X$ from domain $d$, $G'$ only generates $X'=G'(X,d, d')$ in domain $d'$, without considering which sensitive attributes are relevant to the translation. This implies that the model assumes $P_d(X\\mid d,s) = P_{d'}(X'\\mid d',s)$ and $P_d(X \\mid d,s') = P_{d'}(X'\\mid d,s')$ for every $s,s' \\in S$, which is a strong assumption and may not hold in practical scenarios.\n\nWe follow the design choice of $G'$ from FATDM who have assumed the same assumption you have stated and have proved with theoretical bounds that it does not compromise the fairness metric measures.\n\n***\n\n> 3) a)The rationale behind learning distinct representations for each sensitive attribute is not well elucidated. \n\nWe learn distinct representations for each sensitive attribute due to two reasons: \n1. If there exists a representation for a sensitive attribute S, and if two domains A and B have S as a sensitive attribute, then one can seamlessly minimize the distance between the representations of two domains A and B that only pertain to S and not affect the representations of other sensitive attributes in A and B. \n2. If there exists a representation for a sensitive attribute S, and if two domains A and B do not share its sensitivity, then one can seamlessly maximize the distance between representations of A and B that only pertain to S.\n\n> b) Why is it necessary for the model to minimize the gap between domain representations with the same sensitive attribute configurations while maximizing the gap for those with different sensitive attributes? \n\nWhen the sensitive attribute configurations are the same, that is, a domain A has its sensitive attribute set as gender and race and a domain B has its sensitive attribute set as gender and race, we want the predictions of both A and B to be equalized across all values taken by gender and race. Hence, we minimize the distance between the representations that pertain to fairness ($\\mathbf{z}_f$) of domain A and domain B. \\\nOn the other hand, if the sensitive attribute configurations are different, that is domain A has its sensitive attribute set as gender and domain B has its sensitive attribute set as race, then the sensitive attribute set is different, we do not want them to have a similar prediction and maximize the distance between $\\mathbf{z}_f$'s of domains A and B\n\n> c) How does concatenating all representations contribute to accurate and fair predictions in target domains?\n\nThe representation $\\mathbf{z}\\_f$ is optimized for better fairness through loss $L_{DF}$ and the representation $\\mathbf{z}\\_g$ is optimized for better accuracy through loss $L_{DG}$. We use concatenation as it is an easy operation that can combine the two representations to get a final representation which is then sent to the classifier for a prediction that is fair and accurate. \n\n***\n\n> 4) The results in Tables 2 and 3 seem to be presented for a fixed value of $\\gamma$. It would be more comprehensive if the authors varied $\\gamma$ to explore the accuracy-fairness trade-off for the methods used in the experiments.\n\nWe have chosen $\\gamma$ from hyperparameter tuning and have reported the results for the best $\\gamma$ in Tables 2 and 3 in the paper. We have provided an ablation study for $\\gamma$ in Table 5 and show that varying $\\gamma$ has an effect on the accuracy-fairness trade-off. \n\n***\n\n> 5) The final objective, as defined in Equation (10), encompasses a blend of multiple loss components. I recommend that the authors carry out an ablation study, varying hyperparameters, to assess the impact of each loss on the model's performance.\n\nEquation 10 includes $4$ hyperparameters. Out of that, $2$ are already present in the baseline FATDM. FATDM have optimized their values as $\\alpha=0.1$ and $\\omega=1$ in their paper. We adopted the same values in our model too. For the other hyperparameters that were introduced by our approach ($\\epsilon$ and $\\gamma$), we already provide an ablation study in Tables 4 and 5 in the paper.\n\n***"

                        "value": "> 6) The technical novelty of the paper appears somewhat limited. The primary contribution appears to be the utilization of distinct representations for each sensitive attribute. \n\nWe introduced the idea of learning two different representations (which are combined at the end) for capturing fairness and generalizability to a target domain. We have introduced a very practical problem of having multiple sensitive attributes across different domains in a domain generalization setting and have proposed a simple and clear solution for the same.  We believe that the simplicity of our method is one of the positive aspects of our method as it is very easy for a researcher/engineer to understand and implement the model in practice.\n\n***\n\n> 7) In the introduction section (Fig. 1), the authors assert that the proposed method can accommodate the heterogeneity of sensitive attributes across domains. However, in the experimental section, the models seem to have access to all sensitive attributes in all domains, which may contradict the initial claim.\n\nWe assume that we have access to a set of possible sensitive attributesinformation on whether an attribute is sensitive is not part of the observations and is specified by the user. Hence we identify a possible set of sensitive attributes and train the model to face any subset of sensitive attributes from the possible set. As the sensitivity of an attribute is user-specified and not present in the observations, at the time of training we combine any set of sensitive attributes with any domain randomly and train the model so that the model is prepared for any new combination of the sensitive attribute. We have emphasized this in the Introduction section of our paper.\n\n***\n> 8) The paper lacks the provision of code and supplementary documentation, which could significantly enhance clarity and reproducibility. Providing these resources would be beneficial for the reader to understand and replicate the methodology.\n\nWe have provided a link to the code along with the rebuttal"

Traditional domain generalization methods aim to generalize a model's performance to unseen domains but often ignore the aspect of fairness, especially when multiple sensitive attributes are involved.\n\nThe authors propose a novel framework capable of handling fairness with respect to multiple sensitive attributes across different domains, including unseen ones. This is achieved through the development of two types of representations: a domain-invariant representation for generalizing model performance and a selective domain-invariant representation for transferring fairness to domains with similar sensitive attributes. A key innovation of the proposed method is its ability to reduce computational complexity significantly."

However, to have a comprehensive set of experiments, we also decided to run experiments on CelebA which is a popular dataset in the field of fairness [4],[10],[11]. The target attribute for the dataset CelebA is Attractiveness. Past papers [4],[10],[11] have chosen Male as the sensitive attribute due to less no of images corresponding to males versus females in the data. Since we are considering multiple sensitive attributes, we randomly chose 3 other attributes: Big Nose, Smiling, and Young. Also, our intuition was that whether a person is Smiling should not contribute to whether they are Attractive.\n\n[4] Fair Mixup: Fairness Via Interpolation, ICLR 2021 \\\n[10] Inclusivefacenet: Improving face attribute detection with race and gender diversity, FAT/ML 2018 \\\n[11] Leveling down in computer vision: Pareto inefficiencies in fair deep classifiers, CVPR 2022\n\n*** \n\n> 4) Could you elaborate on the robustness of your method against different types of distribution shifts compared to existing methods by providing ablation studies?\n\nCurrently, we only consider covariate shift as the distribution shift in the scope of this paper.

In the second item of contributions in the Introduction, except the problem mentioned in the first contribution, what is the other problem when you say \"both problems\"?\n4. What is the relationship between the target domain \\Tilde{d} with source domains? Is the target domain shifted from sources due to covariate shift, too? If not, what assumption do you make on target domains? This lack of clarification and, hence, unclear to me. Besides, giving a brief introduction to covariate shifts is necessary. \n5. I doubt the novelty of proposing the setting in multiple sensitive attributes. To me, a dataset with multiple sensitive attributes can be easily converted to one with a single sensitive attribute with multiple categories. For example, as stated in the paper, a sensitivity configuration set \\mathcal{C}={[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]} can be viewed as a set {1,2,3,4} where a single sensitive attribute with four distinct categorical values. \n6.

According to Eq.(5), the loss L_{DG} is defined as the expectation across all source domains. Therefore, it is not convincing to me that the generalization encoder can be generalized to an unseen target domain when a covariate shift occurs. \n9. In the fairness encoder, x is concatenated with c. I am wondering how to do it empirically when x is an image while c is one of the annotations of the image. Please explain your experiments for implementation using the CelebA as an example. \n10.

Although this work mentions fairness multiple times, it is unclear to me how to mitigate the spurious correlations during training.

We agree that they are all broadly under fairness-aware domain generalization and we have added these papers to our related works section in the revised version of the paper. \nHowever, we would like to emphasize the difference between these papers and FATDM. Papers [1] and [2] reduce the correlations between target attributes and sensitive groups and their goal is to improve the test accuracy of the predictions of the worst-case represented sensitive group. (E.g. removing correlations of land birds with land).  \nFATDM lies in the line of works like [4], [5], [6] which achieve fairness by reducing bias against any instance of a sensitive group by equalizing the predictions for different instances of the sensitive groups via optimizing metrics like equal opportunity, equalized odds or demographic parity (E.g., predicting with similar true positive and false positives whether gender=Male or Female). [3] optimizes equalized odds and is similar to FATDM, however, their focus is to address the online learning problem. \n\n[1] Environment Inference for Invariant Learning, ICML 2021 \\\n[2] Learning Fair Representation via Distributional Contrastive Disentanglement, KDD 2022 \\\n[3] Towards Fair Disentangled Online Learning for Changing Environments, KDD 2023 \\\n[4] Fair Mixup: Fairness Via Interpolation, ICLR 2021 \\\n[5] Equality of opportunity in supervised learning, NeurIPS 2016 \\\n[6] Empirical Risk Minimization Under Fairness Constraints, NeurIPS 2018 \n\n***\n\n> 2) Figure 2 is unclear to me.

To me, a dataset with multiple sensitive attributes can be easily converted to one with a single sensitive attribute with multiple categories.\n\nIt may be possible to view multiple sensitive attributes as a single sensitive attribute with multiple categories. **However, our contribution is not to just extend domain generalization and fairness to a multi-attribute setting. In a multi-attribute setting, each domain can have a different set of sensitive attributes (which we assume are decided by a user based on the application at hand). Hence, we also address the problem of the target domain having a different set of sensitive attributes from that of the source.** We discuss these contributions under paragraphs $2$ and $3$ of the introduction section of the paper. \\\n\nOur baseline is a naive modification of the existing approach FATDM (designed for a single sensitive attribute) to cater to a multi-attribute setting. We compare it against our method SISA which considers the differences in the sensitivity of the attributes across different domains. From the experimental results, we show that our method is better at both performance on the target domain and fairness measures for all subsets from a possible set of sensitive attributes in the target domain.\n\n*** \n\n> 6) Does data sample $\\mathbf{x}$ include sensitive attribute $\\mathbf{c}$?\t\n\nNo, $\\mathbf{x}$ is an image of size $256$x$256$x$1$ for MIMIC CXR and $256$x$256$x$3$ for CelebA. $\\mathbf{c}$ is a binary vector of size $n$x$1$ where $n$ is the total number of possible sensitive attributes. We provide it to the model as additional meta information.\n\n***\n\n> 7) In Eq.(1), \"d'\" should be replaced by \"d''\"\n\nNo, we use $\\mathbf{x}''$ and $\\mathbf{x}'$ and $G''$ and $G'$ to denote the differences in the density transformation model and its output. However, both  $\\mathbf{x}''$ and $\\mathbf{x}'$ are from $d' \\in D$.\n\n***\n\n> 8) How to ensure $g_\\theta$ encodes an invariant representation across domains? According to Eq.(5), the loss $L_{DG}$ is defined as the expectation across all source domains. Therefore, it is not convincing to me that the generalization encoder can be generalized to an unseen target domain when a covariate shift occurs.\n\nPrior works [7],[8],[9] have theoretically proved that error on the target domain is upper bounded by the training error on the source domains, pairwise divergences among the source domains, and divergence between the source and the target domain. As we do not have access to target domains, we follow previous works and minimize the pairwise divergence among the source domains through domain invariant representation learning ($L_{DG}$) and the training error on the source domains ($L_{ERR}$) for a lower error on the predictions of the target domain.\n\n[7] Generalizing to unseen domains via distribution matching, 2019 \\\n[8]  Fairness and accuracy under domain generalization, ICLR 2023 \\\n[9] On Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Transfer Learning with Multiple Sources, NeurIPS 2021\n\n***\n\n> 9) In the fairness encoder,  $\\mathbf{x}$ is concatenated with $\\mathbf{c}$. I am wondering how to do it empirically when $\\mathbf{x}$ is an image while $\\mathbf{c}$ is one of the annotations of the image. Please explain your experiments for implementation using the CelebA as an example.\t\n\n$\\mathbf{c}$ is a binary vector of size $n$x$1$. We reshape it to $256$x$256$x$1$ by repeating its values over dimensions $1$ and $2$ and adding a $3$rd dimension. Then it is concatenated to input $\\mathbf{x}$ as an additional channel. So the total dimension of the input ($\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{c}$ = $256$x$256$x$2$ for MIMIC CXR and $256$x$256$x$4$ for CelebA). We have provided the code to get more insight into this.\n\n***\n\n> 10) Speaking of fair machine learning in general, it aims to mitigate spurious correlations between sensitive attributes and model outcomes. Although this work mentions fairness multiple times, it is unclear to me how to mitigate the spurious correlations during training. This work proposes that it \"minimize the gap between the domain representations that have the same sensitive attribute configurations and maximize the gap for representations with different sensitive attributes\". But this does not ensure unfairness is controllable.\n\nOur focus is on the notion of fairness that aims to balance classifier errors across population subgroups, for example, by matching error rates across genders or different racial groups. \\\nHowever, based on the review, we have added Table 13 to the supplementary section of our paper showing the Pearson correlation measure between the sensitive attributes and the target attribute predictions of our model and ERM. Our model reduces the correlation between the sensitive attributes and the model prediction."
