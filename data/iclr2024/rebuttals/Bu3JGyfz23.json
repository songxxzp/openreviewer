                    "value": "This paper proposes a new approach to multi-view subspace learning termed as multi-view latent space learning via adaptive graph embedding (MvSLGE), which learns a latent representation from all view features. Unlike most existing multi-view latent space learning methods that only encode the complementary information into the latent representation, MvSLGE adaptively learn an adjacent graph that well characterizes similarity between samples to further regularize the latent representation. To extract the neighborhood information from multi-view features, the authors propose a novel strategy that constructs one graph for each view, and then the learned graph is approximately designed as a centroid of these graphs of different views with different weights."

                    "value": "1. The originality, quality, and significance of this paper is supported by the proposed MvSLGE, which fuses the multi-view features to construct one common latent representation and incorporate complementary information of heterogeneous property features.\n\n2. The clarity of this paper is satisfied based on the clear listed motivations and contributions of their work."

                    "value": "1. The biggest problem of this paper is the limited novelty in formulation shown in Eq. (5), which adopts different regulation terms to consider the outliers, Laplacian embedding and local geometry structure from multi-view features. The combination of these regulation terms more or less limits the novelty of this paper, which seems to be incremental compared with the existing works. I hope the authors can present their work from a higher perspective, even based on the combination of different regulation terms, i.e., the related theoretical illustration or other aspects.\n\n2. The performance improvements in this paper are obtained based on the added several regulation terms, which more or less adds the computation cost compared with those methods without these several regulation terms. I hope the authors can analyze the computation cost at the end of section 3.2. \n\n3. The compared methods in classification and robust testing in the experiment are not enough. The authors are expected to add more representative or the latest methods for comparison in the experiment. Besides, the datasets adopted for comparison are not enough.\n\n4. The authors are expected to repeat each experiment for many times and record the mean and devition to avoid the possible randomness in the experiment, i.e., Table 2 and Table 3.\n\n5.  The ablation study regarding the added three regulation terms are all expected to conduct in the experiment and just investigate the auto-weighted scheme is not enough.\n\n6. The authors are suggested to adopt other symbol to represent the common latent representation rather than X in this paper. As is known, X is usually adopted the original dataset and this is the first time for me to see that X is adopted to represent the others in this area."
