Video-LLaMA has good text generation but suffers from hallucination, while SimCSR balances generation and retrieval without hallucination."

Larger scale evaluation would provide more confidence.\nAlso mentioned in the paper, some evaluation is based on only tens of samples:\n\nSec 3.3 \u2026 we compared ranking by metrics to that of human preference. We selected 20 videos from annotated responses\u2026\n\nSec 4.2 \u2026 we randomly selected 20 summaries generated by Video-LLaMA and our end-to-end model SimCSR (see next section), and evaluated the degree of hallucination in their responses\u2026\n\n\nThe motivation behind the joint evaluation of captioning and summarization is unclear. The authors evaluate both capabilities on the same relatively small dataset of 4.8k videos. However, captioning and summarization could be evaluated separately on larger datasets specifically tailored for each task. For example, captioning could be evaluated on existing datasets like MSR-VTT and summarization on long-form video datasets (e.g. synopsis). The rationale for creating a smaller joint evaluation benchmark rather than leveraging larger separate datasets for each task is not sufficiently justified. The authors could expand on their motivations for joint evaluation rather than independent testing on larger captioning and summarization datasets. As it stands, the decision to combine the tasks may limit the scale and focus of the evaluation."

We plan on extensively revising our manuscript with a larger evaluation dataset (10K) and more extensive benchmarking and will be withdrawing our submission as a result.\nHowever, we'd like to address a few points raised by the reviewer for clarification.\n1. Extensiveness of the dataset: our evaluation dataset (4.8K videos with 5 human-annotated captions and summaries per video) is similar to or larger in size than similar datasets in the literature (e.g. MSVD 2000 video segments, MSRVTT 3K video clips) albeit with significantly longer video durations (upwards of 60 seconds as opposed to ~10 seconds in MSRVTT).\n2. Limited human evaluation for model hallucination: we acknowledge that 20 randomly selected samples is limited in scale and are working on increasing the scale of this evaluation.\n3. Joint Evaluation: the reviewer seems to suggest that evaluating model's ability to generate both short and long textual descriptions on a common set of videos limit the scale of the evaluation dataset. We'd like to clarify that the fundamental limitation of the scale of the benchmark is due to the fundamental challenge of human annotation. Additionally, we argue that providing a benchmark that supports both evaluation of short and long video descriptions does not limit the application of the video-CSR dataset to only either one of the two applications."

Questions 1 and 3 raised by the reviewer both concern the training dataset. We'd like to clarify that the training dataset is not part of the released video-csr evaluation dataset and was included for completeness in describing our end-to-end SimCSR model. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer's question directly, it was not possible to secure enough human annotators to annotate each training video from scratch as there were 200K video clips in the train dataset. As a result, metadata information from videos was used to generate a large training dataset similar to techniques employed by contemporary works such as VAST-27M. As per prompt engineering being a source of bias in the training dataset, we sampled multiple captions/summaries for each prompt (i.e. each video clip) to hopefully reduce the bias in the model generated caption/summary. However, the paper was indeed lacking in a quantitative analysis of the bias in the model generated responses and we'll be working to improve upon this aspect of the work.\n2. Evalution of hallucination: evaluation of hallucination is indeed a relatively subjective metric. However, in the absence of tried-and-true quantifiable measures that specifically gauge model hallucination, we believe that human evaluation is the most reliable alternative. However, to provide a more unbiased evaluation of model hallucination, we intend to increase the number of samples evaluated."

The dataset will be invaluable for benchmarking the performance of Video LLMs and will serve as a useful resource for future research aiming to gauge advancements in the realm of video summarization and captioning. Additionally, the paper presents a method for summary retrieval, which is crucial for assessing the alignment between a model's visual and language features. The authors also conduct a comprehensive analysis of appropriate metrics for evaluating text generation tasks. The dataset's quality is ensured through rigorous curation and annotation validation, with multiple annotators employed and their annotation quality being assessed in various ways.

The paper doesn't provide a clear comparison with other benchmarks of a similar nature. It remains unclear why this benchmark is preferable over others for evaluating Video LLMs.\n2. While the proposed benchmark in the paper is promising, the depth of its benchmarking appears limited. The authors have exclusively experimented with a single VideoLLM. Yet, as they've acknowledged, several other models exist [D,E]. A more exhaustive benchmarking against current methodologies would significantly strengthen the paper's contributions. I'd also suggest adapting some image-based methods [A,B,C] using a straightforward sliding window inference. Such an addition would offer a broader and more credible spectrum of methods, encouraging the community to adopt the benchmark.\n    - Why is the performance of Video-LLava on the Captioning task not reported in Table 5?\n    - Why is there an absence of other methods in the retrieval task assessment?\n3. The paper's method is very simple and heavily based on VideoCoCa. Additionally, it does not perform better than Video-LLAMA. It is clearly not the strongest contribution of the paper.\n\n\n[A] Zhu, D., Chen, J., Shen, X., Li, X., & Elhoseiny, M. (2023).

                    "value": "1. **Benchmark Comparison & Importance for VideoLLMs**: How does the introduced method compare against current video summarization/captioning benchmarks? Particularly for VideoLLMs, why is this benchmark needed? Point out limitations of current benchmarks and illustrate how this new one fills them or offers a better evaluation.\n\n2. **Exclusivity of Video-llava in the Benchmark (Weakness 2)**: The paper predominantly highlights the evaluation with Video-llava. Could you explain the reason for focusing solely on this model and not incorporating other pertinent methods? Diversifying the benchmark with multiple methods would enrich the evaluation and make the results more universally applicable.\n\n3. **Necessity & Novelty of the Proposed Method (Weakness 3)**: The necessity of the proposed method is currently under-explained. Can you provide a detailed argument about the unique advantages or features that your approach introduces, especially when compared with existing methods? Given the apparent simplicity and heavy reliance on VideoCoCa, as well as its underwhelming performance in comparison to Video-LLAMA, it would be beneficial to understand the distinct value proposition of your method.\n\n**Citation Correction**: It's pivotal to credit research correctly. Notably, the ActivityNet dataset was introduced by Caba Heilbron et al. in 2015 [H], not by Krishna et al. in 2017 as cited in the paper. Such discrepancies can compromise the credibility of the paper, and I'd urge a meticulous review to avoid similar oversights.\n\n[H] Heilbron, F. C., Escorcia, V., Ghanem, B., & Niebles, J. C.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the detailed feedback. We plan on extensively revising our manuscript with a larger evaluation dataset (10K) and more extensive benchmarking and will be withdrawing our submission as a result.\nWe acknowledge the fact that, due to time constraints, benchmarking in the current paper is limited in terms of its extensiveness against current SOTA models. The proposed SimCSR model was solely included to serve as a baseline for the video-csr benchmark and we plan on potentially replacing the SimCSR model in favor of a more complete evaluation against existing video-to-text models.\nWith respect to comparison of our evaluation dataset with other datasets, we'd like to reiterate that the current dataset is the first evaluation dataset where the textual description of video content is paragraph-length. As the reviewer pointed out, with the advent of LLMs that are capable of generating pages of texts, long-form image-to-text and video-to-text generation tasks are within reach of the latest video-language models. However, to the best of our knowledge, such evaluation benchmark is currently missing in the literature. Additionally, as we explored in the manuscript, the gap between syntactic and semantic similarities widens dramatically as the length of the textual descriptions increases. As such, we believe the video-csr dataset defines a new type of evaluation benchmark that fulfills a need of the current multimodal research effort."
