                    "value": "The paper proposes an approach for spatiotemporal modeling using physics-aware causality. The approach integrates domain knowledge with data-driven models to construct more robust and interpretable pipelines. The model learns causal weights from spatially close and temporally past observations to current observations via semi-supervised learning, allowing it to capture the underlying cause-effect relationships in the data. The approach employs a regularization term to capture the causal structures that align with the physics-aware causality, further improving the model's performance. The model's ability to handle noisy and limited data is demonstrated by extensive experiments on time series data, and its superior forecasting performance on real-world graph signals highlights its effectiveness in capturing the underlying physics principles governing spatiotemporal observations. Overall, the proposed approach is a promising direction forward in the field of machine learning, with potential applications in climate, traffic systems, and electricity networks."

Typically, methods based on physical principles might not perform well in real-world settings and can exhibit weak generalization capabilities. I would like to see the authors conduct tests on real-world graph data to better demonstrate the generalization ability of their model.\n\n2. The authors should consider testing their approach on more challenging datasets, such as the n-body system, to further validate its effectiveness.\n\n3. While the paper emphasizes causal theory, I did not observe explicit references or applications of foundational causal concepts, such as backdoor adjustment or front door adjustment. I encourage the authors to elucidate the underlying causal motivations and proofs in greater detail. This would significantly strengthen the paper's results and its overall contributions."

We answer the questions below.\n\n**Q1 [Generalization Evaluation]:** We conducted the generalization evaluation on real-world graph data as shown in Appendix G.3. In particular, we perform an ablation study where we train P-STCGN on one region and test on another region for climate forecasting.  Table 9 shows that our proposed model achieves improved generalization performance compared to the baseline.\n\n**Q2 [Evaluation on more challenging tasks]:** Thank you for the suggestion. We will consider the more challenging n-body system for further evaluation.\n\n**Q3 [Clarity on foundational causal concepts]:** While our paper doesn\u2019t aim to develop a comprehensive causal discovery theory, we appreciate your suggestion to enhance clarity on foundational concepts. In the current presentation, we primarily focus on motivating the causal representation of physics equations as discussed in the Introduction and Problem Formulation sections. We provide the detailed discussions on causal discovery in time series in Appendix A."

This integration aims to enhance the robustness of spatiotemporal models by leveraging valuable inductive biases from interpretable physics equations. The primary challenges addressed involve the mismatch between the assumptions of existing models and real-world observations. The P-STCGN model capitalizes on the inherent causal relationships present in physical dynamics across both space and time."

The introduction mentions the existence of various physical laws in the real world. However, in the model and specific dataset experiments, these physical laws were not introduced as prior knowledge. I am curious whether this prior was learned or predefined. Moreover, since the introduction (in the second paragraph) states that partial physical laws can be discovered from real-world data, I wonder why no tests on related real data were conducted to verify this claim. These inconsistencies negatively impact the overall coherence of the paper, making it challenging to read. \n\n(2) The paper emphasizes modeling using causal theory. However, learning causal correlations through an MLP (Multi-layer Perceptron) seems somewhat inappropriate. In other words, the causal relationships in the model are determined by a black-box network. This approach might require further justification. While I completely understand the use of attention mechanisms to establish interpretability and correlation, an MLP seems to lack a logical foundation in this context."

We answer the questions below. \n\n**Q1 [Comparisons to more baselines]:** While we primarily focus on comparison to physics-informed frameworks, we appreciate the suggestion and will consider more SOTA data-driven frameworks.   \n\n**Q2 [Clarifications on the prior]:** In our real-world dataset evaluations, we described the causal labels from PDEs. Since there is no ground truth PDEs for the dataset, we consider PDEs among the family of the continuity equation, e.g., diffusion, convection, and Navier-Stokes equations. The prior is pre-defined. We will further clarify this in the revision.\n\n**Q3 [Discovering partial physical laws]:** We apologize for the confusion. The primary goal of this paper is not to perform equation discovery. We are aimed at introducing a soft integration of physics laws, that are potentially incomplete and noisy, into deep models through causal learning. By doing this, our approach doesn\u2019t rely on the assumption that the precise prior knowledge is accessible. We will clarify this statement in our introduction. We value the reviewer\u2019s point, and we find it very interesting. We would like to study the effectiveness of causal approaches in helping to discover partial physics laws as our future work."

                        "value": "Thank you for the encouraging comments and insights. We answer the questions below.\n\n**Q1 [Ambiguous prior knowledge and noisy data]:** The goal of the paper is to address the challenge due to limited access to precise knowledge, which can be caused by the ambiguity of the prior knowledge or data noise. Our assumption is that the prior knowledge is moderately beneficial for modeling observations. In our causal structure learning evaluations, we show that our approach is robust to data noise by leveraging prior physics knowledge. In our real-world evaluation where ground truth PDEs are not available, we adopt the family of the continuity equation. Through the proposed semi-supervised causal structure learning, our model still achieves improved performance.\n\n**Q2 [Verify the accuracy of integrated prior knowledge]:** We verify the accuracy through the extensive causal structure learning evaluation using both synthetic data and benchmarks. In these settings, we know the ground truth equations for generating the data and thus we quantitatively measure the accuracy of the learned caudal structures with prior knowledge integrated.  Results demonstrate that our approach can perform accurate causal structure discovery, aligning well with prior knowledge.\n\n**Q3 [Extending to other domains]:** Our approach is domain-agnostic. Once moderately beneficial physics equations are identified, our method can be straightforwardly applied to any domain."

                    "value": "My major concerns are:\n1. Insufficient related work. To the best of my knowledge, there is quite a large number of literature exploring the integration of physics law or causality into spatio-temporal graph neural networks [1,2,3,4,5,6]. For example, [1,2,6] employ neural ordinary differential equations to capture continuous ST dependencies. Ji et al. propose a physics-guided neural network for spatiotemporal modeling in traffic flows [3]. CaST designs a new framework for handling causality in spatio-temporal graphs [4]. However, this paper lacks a discussion on these studies and doesn't compare the proposed model with them either. What's the difference between them? Why should we use the proposed model? It would be good to survey more related publications before paper submission. What's more, the related work section should be included in the main body of the paper, instead of the appendix.\n2. The technical contribution of this work against existing approaches is not significant, which is clearly below the acceptance level of ICLR.\n3. The term \"causality\" in this paper is questionable. This causality is more similar to proximity in other spatio-temporal graph neural networks [7, 8], rather than the actual causality in causal inference. \n4. The learned causality in this paper lacks justification.\n5. The baselines used in this paper are weak and outdated. Please consider more recent baselines for comparison (see the above references). \n6. This paper lacks the experiment over one of the most popular tasks -- traffic forecasting, which is also driven by inherent physics laws.\n7. No source code for reproducing the results.\n8. No discussion on the model efficiency and model size.\n\nReference:\n\n[1] Fang, et al. \"Spatial-temporal graph ode networks for traffic flow forecasting.\" SIGKDD 2021.\n\n[2] Choi,et al. \"Graph neural controlled differential equations for traffic forecasting.\" AAAI 2022.\n\n[3] Ji et al. \"STDEN: Towards physics-guided neural networks for traffic flow prediction.\" AAAI 2021.\n\n[4] Xia et al. \"Deciphering Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting: A Causal Lens and Treatment.\" NeurIPS 2023.\n\n[5] Jia et al. \"Physics-guided recurrent graph model for predicting flow and temperature in river networks.\" SDM 2021.\n\n[6] Liang et al. \"Mixed-order relation-aware recurrent neural networks for spatio-temporal forecasting.\" TKDE 2022.\n\n[7] Wu et al. \"Graph wavenet for deep spatial-temporal graph modeling.\" IJCAI 2019.\n\n[8] Bai et al. \"Adaptive graph convolutional recurrent network for traffic forecasting.\" NeurIPS 2020."

We will check them and properly incorporate them into our revision.\n\n**Q2 [Technical novelty and the term \u2018Causality\u2019]:** The technical novelty of our approach lies in a systematically soft integration method, incorporating prior physics equations into deep models through causal structure learning. This approach is non-trivial, as the existing physics-informed deep learning literature had shown limited focus on the causal representation of physics equations. Our approach distinctly deviates from existing works [7,8], as our goal is to leverage prior physics equations, thereby relaxing assumptions on accessing precise physics knowledge.\n\n**Q3 [Justifications of causality]:** In section 4.1, we perform extensive evaluation on causal structure learning on synthetic and benchmark time series data. In these settings, we know the ground truth equations for generating the data and thus we quantitatively measure the accuracy of the learned caudal structures with prior knowledge integrated.  Results demonstrate that our approach can perform accurate causal structure discovery, aligning well with prior knowledge.\n\n**Q4 [Evaluations on traffic forecasting]:** Thank you for the suggestions. We will extend our approach to traffic forecasting to further evaluation its effectiveness as future work."
