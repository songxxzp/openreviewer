Authors show that graphs after transformation can be fully distinguished by 1-WL, resulting in a simple MPNN that can be maximally expressive for it. Since most real-world molecular graphs are outerplanar graphs, the proposed method has great potential for related downstream tasks, avoiding the high computational cost introduced by traditional high-expressive GNNs. Authors compare their transformation with the original one on several real-world datasets and demonstrate the improvement."

In Table 3 we provide first evidence that $\\text{CAT}$ typically reduces the diameter and the effective resistance of the graphs. However, as $\\text{CAT}$ is not designed specifically for this, we see further investigation into whether $\\text{CAT}$ can help reduce oversquashing and long range tasks in general as future work.\n\n**Question 1:**   \n>Can the authors explain why the CAT achieved worse performance than the original one in MOLLIPO and MOLTOX21? \n\nUnfortunately, we do not have insights on why $\\text{CAT}$ performs worse on these datasets. Overall it is difficult to say why certain models do not perform well on certain datasets and it often requires more insight in both the dataset and the task at hand, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the model. Our goal was not to achieve state-of-the-art performance on all datasets. Instead we show that $\\text{CAT}$ in most cases increases the performance for commonly used datasets with outerplanar graphs (ZINC and the $8$ MOL- datasets from OGB)."

The authors rely on a specific property of outerplanar graphs: biconnected outerplanar graphs have a unique hamiltonian cycle which can be identified in linear time, and this by identifying this cycle, one can uniquely identify each biconnected outerplanar graph. The authors hence use a linear-time algorithm to identify the cycle, and then compute the hamiltonian adjacency list (HAL), which is then used to create an annotated transformation of the input graph. Since 1-WL-expressive GNNs can identify any labelled trees, the authors show that the presented algorithm combined with a 1-WL-expressive-GNN can identify outerplanar graphs. Experiments on two molecular datasets shows that the method yields meaningful improvements on the baseline GNN models."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- **Scholarship**: The fundamental of this paper is to annotate graphs with labels to enhance the discriminative capacity of standard GNNs, which is widely studied under different node labelling approaches and a more thorough related work coverage is essential. Most importantly, there is a recent paper \"Dimitrov et al, PlanE: Representation Learning on Planar Graphs, NeurIPS 2023\"  which introduces a *complete algorithm on the class of all planar graphs*. This paper strictly subsumes the result presented in the current submission.\n\n- **Technically incorrect statements**: There are many hand-wavy and sometimes incorrect statements. First of all, authors should cite the paper \"Kiefer et al,  The Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension of Planar Graphs is at most 3, LICS 2017\" or its journal version and present the result correctly: The result states that 3-WL is complete on planar graphs (and not just on outerplanar graphs). Moreover, authors also confuse the dimension counts of WL: \"...any GNN which matches the expressivity of 3-WL, such as 3-IGN (Maron et al., 2019) or 3-GNN (Morris et al., 2019), is capable of solving our main goal of distinguishing all outerplanar graphs.\" This is incorrect since Kiefer et al's result uses the classical WL algorithm also referred as the folklore 3-WL, so neither 3-IGN nor 3-GNNs have folklore 3-WL power. It is also open whether folklore 2-WL would suffice for planar isomorphism testing.\n\n- **Significance and novelty**: The paper's technical contribution is limited. Leveraging 1-WL result in combination with CAT is interesting but relatively straightforward. My biggest concern is that there are complete neural models on planar graphs, which are also very scalable. The other technical contributions amount to arguing about shortening the propagation distance in the graph for better information flow. I find this analysis somewhat weak, because this effect can be trivially achieved by adding a virtual node or alike. It appears tangential to the study. \n\n- **Baselines**: I understand that the authors would like to convey the idea of empowering existing GNN models with CAT, but I still think the comparison should be broader when it comes to baseline models.There are many models, including e.g. CIN which achieves very strong results on ZINC. There is also the question of whether this method is applicable to a broader class of models."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your review. \n\n**Weakness Scholarship:**  \nWe address [1] in an answer to all reviewers, but we would be happy to address any further comments you may have. We would like to emphasize that while we focus on the smaller group of outerplanar graphs, our pre-processing works in linear time.\n\n**Weakness Technically Incorrect Statements:**\n> Technically incorrect statements: There are many hand-wavy and sometimes incorrect statements. \n\nWe are happy to clarify any issues and provide more details if some statements were unclear. Please point us to additional statements you find hand-wavy or even incorrect, besides the one regarding the WL-dimension.\n\nRegarding the latter statement, we have to disagree. There seems to be a small misunderstanding between the WL-dimension of outerplanar graphs and the WL-dimension of planar graphs. We purposely cited Kiefer's PhD thesis [2] instead of [3], as only her thesis contains a result specifically for outerplanar graphs. In particular, Corollary $7.40$ [2] states that the WL-dimension of outerplanar graphs is $2$. Note that what Kiefer calls WL is in the GNN literature typically called FWL (folklore WL). This means that $2$-FWL is necessary (i.e., $1$-WL / color refinement is not enough) and sufficient ($3$-FWL is not required) for outerplanar graphs. Furthermore, 2-FWL is equivalent to what the GNN community calls 3-WL. By the known equivalence of, e.g., $3$-WL-GNNs / $3$-IGN to $3$-WL and hence $2$-FWL, we see that the two mentioned GNNs are the $k$-IGN / $k$-WL-GNNs variants with minimum $k$ that one would need to distinguish all outerplanar graphs. Note that they have a runtime of roughly $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.\n\nBy contrast, [3] shows that the WL-dimension of planar graphs is at most $3$ (and it is still open whether it could be $2$). Hence $3$-FWL and $4$-WL are sufficient to distinguish all planar graphs. By the previous explanation, this would require (as long as it remains open whether the WL-dimension is $2$ or $3$) to use $4$-IGNs / $4$-WL-GNNs, with an impractical runtime of roughly $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$.\n\n**Weakness Significance and Novelty:**\n\n> My biggest concern is that there are complete neural models on planar graphs, which are also very scalable.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no linear-time complete models for outerplanar graphs except $\\text{CAT}$. PlanE requires quadratic time preprocessing (see global response). \n\n> The other technical contributions amount to arguing about shortening the propagation distance in the graph for better information flow. I find this analysis somewhat weak, because this effect can be trivially achieved by adding a virtual node or alike. It appears tangential to the study. \n\nThis can indeed be trivially achieved with a virtual node or with other graph rewiring methods. However, the main goal of $\\text{CAT}$ was to improve expressivity. As $\\text{CAT}$ adds nodes and edges to the graph, we wanted to analyze how this affects other graph properties important for learning.  As such, we believe that showing that $\\text{CAT}$ does not increase the diameter arbitrarily (and actually decreases diameter and average effective resistance in practice) is a useful result. After all, our analysis shows that it is **not** necessary to employ methods like virtual nodes in conjunction with $\\text{CAT}$.\n\n**Weakness Baselines:**  \nWe are in the process of conducting additional experiments (see global response).\n\n[1] Dimitrov et al., PlanE: Representation Learning over Planar Graphs.

I recommend they explicitly cite the 3WL bound for planar graphs, and then state 2WL bound for outerplanar graphs to put things in better perspective. Additionally, they should make it clear which hierarchy they are referring to especially when they refer to the $k$ dimensional version of the algorithm. \n\n- Regarding novelty, significance, and scholarship: All my concerns remain in terms of these aspects. I appreciate the linear runtime, but this is easy to achieve if we focus on such a small class of graphs. PlanE achieves this for the full class of planar graphs: authors state quadratic time preprocessing as a limitation, but it is clear that this  is due to the difficulty of handling all the triconnected components (which is necessary if one wants to capture the full class). If one is happy with a smaller class of planar graphs, then it is quite easy to design linear-time preprocessing as well. In fact, Block cut trees and even SPQR trees can be constructed in linear time.\n\nOverall I think this is a nice trick to enhance GNNs, but it is very incremental in my opinion."

I respectfully disagree with the authors: I find the proposed approach incremental (regardless of PlanE and other works), because outerplanar graphs is a small class and it is very easy to design linear-time algorithms to strictly subsume the proposed algorithm in this paper. I have already pointed to one way of achieving this, but there are many more. These are very well-known graph structural encodings and are heavily used in the classical graph theory literature. It would have been much more interesting if the proposal was a linear-time algorithm which would apply to a larger class (and had really pushed the limits of linear time encodings)."

The authors give an explicit example of a pair of non-isomorphism outerplanar graphs that cannot be distinguished by the WL test, showing that CAT is necessary. The proposed approach is efficient, in the sense that the CAT of outerplanar graphs can be computed in linear time.\n3.

                    "value": "This paper studies the problem of how to distinguish non-isomorphic *outer-planar* graphs using GNNs. The motivation is that: (1) distinguishing non-isomorphic in the general setting is intrinsically hard; (1) the restricted outer-planar graphs is common in various practical settings, so solving this simpler problem is always significant in real-world applications; (3) it is possible to design extremely efficient GNN models to solve outer-planar graph isomorphism, which only have a linear complexity.\n\nThe authors thus used theoretical results related to outer-planar graphs to design a *preprocessing step* so that the processed (directed) graphs can be distinguished by 1-WL. They also discussed the property of the processed graphs, such as diameter and resistance distance. The approach is efficient in that the graphs are a linear number of vertices and edges.\n\nFinally, the authors conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

I appreciate the topic of studying GNN design for outer-planar graphs: although it is somehow restricted, it still covers important practical applications and sounds reasonable to me.\n2. The paper is clearly written. Despite the sophisticated theoretical background, the presentation is generally easy to read and organizes well. The notations are consistent, and the presented figures is great and intuitive. I particularly appreciate the counterexamples in this paper, which gives insights into the proposed algorithm.\n3. The proposed method is efficient. It has a linear (worst-case) complexity, not only due to using the standard MPNN, but even for the preprocessing step, which contrasts to prior work."

                    "value": "1. Discussions of related work could be more comprehensive. For example, I found that this paper is highly related to the recent paper [1]. Both works share a common foundation rooted in biconnectivity, specifically concerning biconnected components and block cut trees, as well as a focus on distance metrics, encompassing the shortest path distance and resistance distance. Since the motivation of the two papers is also similar (both pointing out the importance of planar graphs in practice and giving molecular graphs as counterexamples), I feel that giving an in-depth discussion (perhaps within the introductory section of your paper), could further justify the paper's significance and provide a more comprehensive context for the reader.\n\n   Besides, I also found that another recent paper [2] studied a similar topic to your paper but this paper currently did not discuss it. Could you provide some discussions for the similarity and difference between the two works?\n\n2. The proposed CAT transformation is somehow complicated, in particular for the general case (Definition 2). I think it may be beneficial to discuss more about the intuition of Definition 2 in Appendix. Moreover, it introduces a lot of additional nodes and edges and even changes an undirected graph to a directed one. While it has indeed shown that the separation power is improved, significantly changing the structure of the input graph may result in some drawbacks. As another problem, can the approach be extended to node classification? \n\n3. The proposed approach only works for outer-planar graphs. Can the results be generalized to general planar graphs? I think Lemma 1 does not hold in the general setting. Since still about 5% of the graphs are not outer-planar as shown in Table 1, this is perhaps a limitation.\n\n4. While the experimental results showed that an MPNN with CAT can outperform vanilla MPNN, such baselines are actually quite weak. I am not fully convinced to what extent the proposed approach is superior in practice.\n\nDespite the weaknesses and questions, I still appreciate this paper and tend towards giving an acceptance. I will consider increasing the score if the concerns are well-addressed.\n\nMiscellaneous minor issue: in the fourth line in page 8, there is a redundant word \"and\".\n\n\n[1] Rethinking the expressive power of GNNs via graph biconnectivity.

Yes, we are happy to extend our discussion of [1] in the related work in the final version of our submission. Most importantly note that all GNNs discussed in [1] have a time complexity of roughly $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, while our approach has linear time complexity for both pre-processing and message passing. Additionally, we would like to point out that merely identifying block and cut vertices (and edges etc.) is not enough to distinguish outerplanar graphs. For example, the two non-isomorphic biconnected outerplanar graphs in our Figure 1 (as undirected graphs) have the same block-cut-vertex-trees (actually just one node). \n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that [1] proposes an architecture that relies on a transformer backbone, while $\\text{CAT}$ is a graph transformation (i.e., a simple pre-processing), which allows for maximally expressive MPNNs (and any GNN that has at least WL expressivity) on outerplanar graphs.\nWe address the relation to the PlanE paper in our answer to all reviewers and will include a discussion thereof in the related work section of our final submission.\n\n**Weakness 2.** Intuition:\nWe will add a thorough description of the intuition of $\\text{CAT}$ to the appendix and include further examples.\n\n> While it has indeed shown that the separation power is improved, significantly changing the structure of the input graph may result in some drawbacks.  \n\nOne possible drawback we considered was that $\\text{CAT}$ might reduce graph connectivity. That is why we included an empirical analysis (Table 3) plus some theoretical guarantees (Proposition 1). We prove that even in the worst case $\\text{CAT}$ never increases the diameter by more than 7. In the empirical analysis we actually observe that connectivity (in terms of average pairwise effective resistance and diameter) decreases in almost all cases. Could you please clarify which other drawbacks are meant here?\n\n\n> Can the approach be extended to node classification? \n\nYes, there is a straightforward extension of our approach to node classification: after the message passing of the MPNN it suffices to apply a multilayer-perceptron to the node representation of the node we want to classify. This has not impact on the theoretical guarantees of $\\text{CAT}$. For the two example graphs from Figure $1$, $1$-WL cannot distinguish the nodes of degree $3$ between the two graphs. With $\\text{CAT}$, however, these nodes can be distinguished."
