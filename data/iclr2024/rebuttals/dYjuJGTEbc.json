They propose to use a Block-Coordinate Descent algorithm that alternates between i) estimating a semi-relaxed GW transport plan using a mirror-descent scheme with an additional strictly concave regularization; ii) updating the diagonal structure D\u2019 in closed-form. Authors empirically study the concavity of the resulting problem, and provide proofs of convergence for their algorithm.

                    "value": "**Overall appreciation**: This paper tends to omit very similar recent works and the theoretical results seem either incomplete (analysis of concavity and relationships with existing graph partitioning/clustering methods) or incremental.\n\n- **1. Authors omit several recent contributions on GW**:\n     - **a)** [A] studies the complete (sr)GW barycenter problem where the target structure is not forced to be a non-negative diagonal matrix. This paper shows that it is a SOTA method for spectrum-preservation graph coarsening and provide strong theoretical contributions supporting its use.\n       **i)** These spectrum properties are also of particular interest for graph partitioning, hence the (sr)GW barycenter problem should be rigorously compared theoretically and empirically to the (sr)GW diagonal barycenter problem. **ii)** I believe that simple Stochastic Block Models (SBM) could provide a stress test over which the srGW diagonal barycenter problem fails contrary to the srGW barycenter problem : e.g using non-assortative SBM with a unique intra-cluster connectivity p smaller than inter-cluster connectivities $q_{cluster_i, cluster_j}$. Moreover I expect the diagonal structure to be more sensitive to contrasts within any SBM, i.e small variations between intra/inter-connectivities. Could authors perform such empirical sanity-checks ?\n\n     - **b)** relations to srGW [Vincent-Cuaz et al, 2022] : **i)** The (sr)GW barycenter problem over a single input graph is a particular case of their dictionary learning. **ii)** The srGW solver proposed by authors is exactly the mirror-descent algorithm introduced in this other paper over which a concave regularization is added. These two points should be clearly stated in the paper.\n\n     - **c)** On the proof of convergence for the algorithm: **i)**  [B, C] provide a scheme of proof to establish a non-asymptotic convergence of the regularized srGW solver. **ii)** An overview of the proof strategy for Theorem 3 should be clearly state. More importantly Lemma 2 should be clarified : as such it seems wrong/ incomplete to me, e.g differentiability issues at the border are avoided, limits are considered out of the domain, continuity arguments are used without defining any topology etc... **ii)** The overall learning algorithm seems to be a particular case of two-block BCD well-studied in [D].\n\n     - **d)** First parts of the supplementary materials: (minor) paragraph  \u2018Non-convexity of GW discrepancy\u2019 exposes known relations. (more important) paragraph \u2018Assumption of uniform distribution\u2019 seems to be a bad justification for the choice of input distributions that only translates the notion of weak-isomorphism discussed in [Chowdhury et al, 2019].\n\n\n- **2. The several concavity analysis done by authors are incomplete and not conclusive:**\n     - **a)** Could you detail the experiments illustrated in Figure 1 ? What is D\u2019 in this setting ? What Is the initial transport plan used for these experiments ? Are these findings consistent w.r.t these initial transport plans (should be validated using the MCMC sampler in SpecGWL) ? What are the solvers used for these experiments ? If entropically regularized ones, please compare results to exact solvers such as conditional gradient solvers.\n    - **b)** Are these findings specific to heat kernels or do they generalize to PSD matrices e.g Laplacians  ?\n    - **c)** None of the theoretical studies on the concavity of the overall learning problem are complete or convincing: **i)** proof/paragraph: \"One common condition for extremal points\" only shows that for an optimal target masses nu*, the resulting GW problem is concave hence solutions are extremities of admissible coupling with marginals mu and nu*. It does not show that extremities of the set of semi-relaxed couplings with first marginal mu, i.e hard-clustering matrices, are solutions. **ii)** I do not see when the other condition in equation 19 could be applied, authors should discuss this point. **iii)** Remark: Overall, a too recent contribution [E] to be taken into account at the submission date deals with these concavity problems for srGW barycenters and could guide authors to derive an analog result for the srGW diagonal barycenters.\n\n\n- **3. Zero masses**: Authors do no mention the flexibility of this learning problem to get optimal target masses which are equal to zero and might allow to detect true number of clusters in some settings, as discussed in [Vincent-Cuaz et al, 2022].\n\n\n- **4. Missing points in experiments**: \n    - **i)** Please benchmark methods in terms of running times too. Trade-off in terms of performances and speed should be explicit.\n    - **ii)** The strongly concave regularization with continuation scheme proposed by authors introduce several hyperparameters. Please conduct an ablation study over this regularization. Plus could you complete Figure 11  that shows that the method is quite sensitive to these hyperparameters, with other datasets ?\n    - **iii)** Authors rely on other GW-based methods to get initial transport plans for their method. Whereas [Vincent-Cuaz et al, 2022] proposed to leverage k-means algorithm, which is a quite common technique in the clustering or graph partitioning literature. I guess, in concave setting solvers can be stuck at extremities, hence it would be relevant to force initial within the polytope e.g with kmeans + mu.nu^T. Could you further compare these choices ?\n\n- **5. Some parts in Section 3.3 are not clear** and should be clarified: **i)** srGW to Identity: \u2018This results in each cluster containing an equal number of data points.\u2019 It clearly does not seem to be the case. **ii)** relation to NMF: does it really coincide with the srGW diagonal barycenter problem or rather with the complete barycenter problem ?\n\n\n\n\n[A] Chen, Yifan, et al. \"A Gromov--Wasserstein Geometric View of Spectrum-Preserving Graph Coarsening.\" International Conference on Machine Learning. 2023.\n\n[B] Scetbon, M., Cuturi, M., & Peyr\u00e9, G.

                        "value": "1.1 We sincerely apologize for overlooking this article. We appreciate the reviewer's excellent suggestions and valuable references. We will  conduct a more systematic study comparing these various methods. We also welcome the reviewer to engage in more detailed discussions and future study with us. \n Regarding srGW, it can be considered a special case of EGWB where $D^{'}$ is fixed as the identity matrix. Additionally, the concave regularization introduced in EGWB is aimed at reducing $\\| \\pi \\|_{L_0}$, increasing its sparsity for obtaining hard clustering results. In srGW, the concave regularization is intended to make $\\nu$ sparser, reducing redundant clusters. Their designs have different intentions, leading to naturally different outcomes. \n\n1.2 The proof of Lemma 2 is derived from reference [a]. If you harbor any inquiries, you may peruse the details. All functions in our paper exhibit continuous differentiability.\n\n1.3 Kindly note that our intention was merely to elucidate that any GW problem can be reformulated under the assumption of $\\mu$ follows the uniform distribution , and this does not imply that our algorithm is exclusively effective for uniform distributions. Our interest in this scenario stems from its simplicity and convenient explication of connections with other clustering methods, such as Min-Cut. The theorems we have proven can be effortlessly extended to encompass any distribution. Furthermore, as demonstrated in our experiments detailed in Appendix B 3.5, the utilization of power-law transformations of data point distributions as $\\mu$ does not impact the final results of EGWB.\n\n2.1 Figure 1 depicts the code using SpecGWL directly with the WIKI dataset, where all hyperparameters and initial values precisely match those of SpecGWL. The intention is to demonstrate that, after thresholding (i.e., selecting the index with the maximum element in each row as the clustering label), the GW distance is further reduced. Therefore, our EGWB focuses on directly seeking hard clustering.\n\n2.2 All convergence proofs are applicable to all positive semi-definite matrices.\n\n2.3 (a) We believe the reviewer has misunderstood our intent. We demonstrated that in the Monge GW problem (which is essentially finding the optimal mapping, corresponding to hard clustering), the setup is such that any $ \\nu $ must satisfy the condition that each node can only belong to one class. Therefore, its Kantorovich relaxation problem is about minimizing a concave function over a convex set, where the solution naturally belongs to the extremal points of $ \\Pi(\\mu, \\nu) $, it is also a part of the extremal points of $\\Pi(\\mu, \\cdot)$. Hence, our problem setup involves using the extremal points of $ \\Pi(\\mu, \\cdot) $ as the feasible set. \n        (b) If $ D $ and $ D^{'} $ are similarity matrices with values ranging between 0 and 1, it is natural that the diagonal of $ D $ is all 1's, satisfying this condition. However, ensuring that $D$ is a positive semi-definite matrix is an open question. \n\n\n3  In theoretical analysis, by relaxing the weight constraints, the optimal value $ \\nu $ can be sparse, implying that some classes may be empty sets. In such cases, we can set the corresponding $ D^{'}_{tt} $ to $-c$ in our paper, where $c$ is a large number (or 1 as discussed in srGW), ensuring that no nodes will be clustered in the $t$-th set in the next iteration. This is because \n\n$\\sum_{i, i^{'}} \\left(D_{ii^{'}}-D_{tt}^{'}\\right)^{2} \\pi_{i t} \\pi_{i^{'} t}$ will be larger than any other component in $ \\mathcal{E}_{D, D^{'}}(\\pi) $. \n    \n4.1 The runtime is not orders of magnitude different because we employ a two-layer optimization, simultaneously optimizing both the target matrix and the transport plan. Each sub-optimization problem for the transport plan has a complexity almost identical to that of GWL or SpecGWL. However, our advantage lies in introducing higher degrees of freedom, theoretically allowing for better results in more complex scenarios.\n\n4.2 We have presented a parameter ablation analysis in Appendices B 3.4, encompassing indices such as GW distance, AMI, ARI, V-measure, and FMI.\n\n5.1 The objective function of srGW is equivalent to a standard Min-Cut function augmented by an exclusive lasso regularization term with a coefficient of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The minimum value of this regularization term is achieved when the sizes of all classes are equal. You can find the proof in our Appendix B.1  for details.\n\n5.2 According to our proof in Appendix B.1, page 21, for any square matrix, Weighted Symmetric NMF is equivalent to the complete Monge-type GW barycenter problem, which means the feasible set is constrained to be mappings represented by rectangular permutation matrices. \n\n[a] Razaviyayn, Meisam, Mingyi Hong, and Zhi-Quan Luo. \"A unified convergence analysis of block successive minimization methods for nonsmooth optimization.\" SIAM Journal on Optimization 23.2 (2013): 1126-1153."

However, there are situations where the notation becomes confusing, posing a challenge to the paper's readability. For example, in the discussion of the \"Monge's type Gromov-Wasserstein barycenter\" in Section 3, the optimal mapping matrix is denoted as $MGW(G, G\u2032)$, but this notation is also used as the objective in the minimization equation (7). The concept of minimizing a matrix raises confusion. In addition, the symbols $\\pi$ and $\\Gamma$ are interchangeably used to refer to the same object. For instance, three lines before equation (7), it states $\\nu=\\pi^T 1_N$, but in this context, as far as I did not misunderstand it, we are assuming a hard clustering mapping and therefore $\\Gamma$ should be the appropriate symbol. Furthermore, though it is not crucial, adding the labels to the x-axis and y-axis of the plots would also ease the readability of the figures.\n\n- The proposed method initialization depends on the results of other methods such as GWL and SpecGWL."

However, it's unclear how the algorithm relies on this initialization. Could a less informed start, like the uniform distribution, yield comparable results or does one need to start from a relatively good initialization?\n- Computational cost: While the paper outlines the computational cost per iteration, the average number of iterations required for convergence remains undisclosed. Additionally, considering the initialization dependency, it's crucial to know the overall time needed to run EGWB, especially if solutions for GWL and SpecGWL must be computed beforehand.\n- Synthetic data: Figure 4 exhibits superior results for GWL and SpecGWL compared to Figure 2. Moreover, in Figure 4 GWL out performs SpecGWL given the true cluster size distribution. Is there any reason why is that the case? I am actually surprised that, for these apparently simple problems GWL and SpecGWL fail to retrieve the right clustering. Understanding the specific reasons for their failure is beneficial in order to comprehend why EGWB, in contrast, succeeds.\n- Number of clusters: A parameter that needs to be set is the expected number of clusters $K$. This is indicated by the number of nodes in the empty graph. How robust is the algorithm to the choice of $K$? Particularly intriguing is the scenario where $K$ exceeds the actual number of clusters. In theory, it is possible that the optimal mapping does not assign any mass to the extra nodes of the empty graph. In that case, the algorithm would still be able to retrieve the true partition. Does this happen in practice, and how does the algorithm adapt to such situations?"

Thank the reviewer for point out those typos, and in response, these have been incorporated in the revised paper. Specifically, (i) MGW represents the Monge-type GW distance induced by the optimal mapping $\\Gamma$. It also depends on the target graph $G^{'}$, which is composed of a matrix $D^{'}$ and node distribution $\\nu$. Our objective is to find the optimal graph $G^{'}(D^{'},\\nu)$. (ii) Figure 3  illustrates the AMI results of SpecGWL, srGW, and EGWB across various heat kernel times (t) for the WIKI dataset.  This figure serves as an illustrative representation of our motivation for delving into graph-based hard clustering.\n\n2. In fact, we thoroughly elaborate on this experiment in the appendix. It is crucial to recognize that this challenge poses a non-convex optimization problem. Consequently, selecting a  well-chosen initial value undoubtedly improves the optimality of the final convergence point to a certain extent.  \n    Both GWL and SpecGWL provide a transport plan $ \\pi $ in the joint distribution space. Using the combinations of these plans as initial points is a natural idea. Moreover, if a uniform distribution is directly employed as the initial value, theoretically, it is equivalent to SpecGWL in the early stages of the algorithm.\n    \n3. The theoretical prediction of average numbers of iterations is still open for such non-convex optimization problems. However, in experiments, we observe that during the inner optimization process for $\\pi$, approximately three hundred iterations are required to reduce the relative error, denoted as $ \\|\\frac{\\pi^{t+1} - \\pi^{t}}{\\pi^{t}}\\|_F $, from $ O(1)  $ to $ O(1 \\times 10^{-4}) $.\n    \n4. Indeed, in our experiments, SpecGWL achieved a smaller GW distance compared to GWL. The crucial point is that both methods employ a fixed $G^{'}(D',\\nu)$ and then learn the transport map, which makes the clustering results less convincing. In contrast, our EGWB treats it as a variable for optimization, introducing more degrees of freedom that are determined by the data, naturally yielding superior results.\n    \n5. In the graph-based clustering experiments conducted, $ K $ is a pre-determined parameter. However, in theoretical analysis, by relaxing the weight constraints, the optimal value $ \\nu $can be sparse, implying that some classes may be empty sets. In such cases, we can set the corresponding $ D^{'} $ to a relatively large constant (eg, 1), as discussed in reference [a]. In our numerical experiments, we treat $K$ as a prescribed parameter such that all methods are compared on the fair stage.\n\n\n\n[a] C\u00e9dric Vincent-Cuaz, R\u00e9mi Flamary, Marco Corneli, Titouan Vayer, and Nicolas Courty.

Thus his/her comment is subjective and not fair.\n\n1. The  $D^{'}(0)$ can be readily derived from equation (10) of our paper, provided one thoroughly peruses our document. Anyway, we can explain it more in detail here: \n    When we have an initial guess $\\pi(0)$, we employ $$\\frac{\\pi^{\\top}_{:,j}(0)D\\pi_{:,j}(0)}{\\pi^{\\top}_{:,j}(0)\\pi_{:,j}(0)}$$ as the diagonal of  $D^{'}(0)$.  The selection of $K$ follows standard procedures as outlined in any clustering textbook. Consequently, in our paper, we treat $K$ as a predetermined parameter, ensuring a fair comparison across all methods.\n    \n2. The main focus of our paper is the clustering based on graph structure. This is clearly stated in section 3.1, where our aim is to solve the hard clustering problems via graph partitioning. The point of doing clustering via graph partitioning has already been made in the literature prior to our paper, see [a][b].\n    \n3. Once more, it appears that the reviewer has not meticulously perused our paper. We have meticulously presented comprehensive numerical results in the appendices, encompassing indices such as ARI, V-measure, and FMI. Nevertheless, to further address this concern, we will augment the main text with a clarifying sentence.\n    \n4. The datasets in Section 4.2 consist of undirected graphs, rendering their adjacency matrices naturally symmetric. In instances involving directed graphs, we opt for the normalized Laplacian, elucidated within the framework of random walks [c]. In all of our numerical experiments, we use the natural adjacency matrices without any artificial symmetrization in order to make our comparison fair. This choice is deliberately articulated in the supplementary materials appended in the appendices.\n    \n5. Figure 3  illustrates the AMI results of SpecGWL, srGW, and EGWB across various heat kernel times (t) for the WIKI dataset.

Theorem 3 provides a conservative condition between $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$ under which the convergence of the alternating algorithm is guaranteed. In practice, we observe that even this condition is violated, the convergence still holds. Anyway, this condition roughly offer a general guideline on selecting practical parameters in order to make the algorithm work.\n3. The stability result with respect to $\\epsilon$ is still on demand. However, we numerically found that $\\epsilon$ does affect the clustering results. This is commented in detail in the next item.\n4. We found that the results were sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter $\\epsilon$ (as is also observed by [a][b]), leading to numerical blowups if not chosen carefully. In reporting each of the results below, we hand-tuned $\\epsilon$ as $\\epsilon=2e-5$ for WIKI and INDIAN datasets, and $\\epsilon=3e-6$ for EU-email and AMAZON datasets.\n\n\n[a] Hongteng Xu, Dixin Luo, and Lawrence Carin.
