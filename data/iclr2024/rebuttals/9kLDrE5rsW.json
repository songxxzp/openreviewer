Two measures based on Wasserstein distance which can quantify the strength of short-term and long-term global dynamics of datasets are proposed. By evaluating the performance of Temporal Graph baselines on several datasets, the authors try to reveal that temporal graph network architectures need deep rethinking for usage in problems with significant global dynamics."

It is hard to tell what figure 1 and figure 2 try to show to the reader and they are not referenced or explained anywhere in the paper.  \n\n3. The main claim in this paper, which is the proposed PopTrack method \"beat\" other TG models, is hardly supported by empirical evaluations. In table 2, PopTrack performs significantly worse than the best baseline on 3 out of 6 datasets. On the first two datasets where PopTrack dominates, it is only compared with 4 baselines instead of 10 baselines like others, and the reason behind this is not explained in the paper.  \n\n4. The literature review is far from enough. Only 13 papers are referenced. Necessary background information and preliminaries are missing (e.g., the definitions of dynamic graphs; the introduction of existing TG models, etc.)  \n\n5. All experiments are conducted on the specific TGB datasets, which may follow certain patterns that can be easily captured by a simple model as \u201cshortcuts\u201d. It is unclear to what extent the conclusions drawn from here still hold on other sources of datasets, which narrows its applicability and limits the contributions of the paper."

                    "value": "**W1. There are no formal statements regarding the problem/task considered in this paper. Some statements are also inconsistent.**\n  \nFor instance, it is unclear that the authors considered (1) which data model (e.g., discrete-time dynamic graph or continuous-time dynamic graph) of dynamic graphs, (2) whether graph attributes (e.g., node and edge attributes) are available, (3) whether the edges are directed or undirected, (4) whether the edges are unweighted or weighted, etc.\n  \nWhat is the formal definition of dynamic link property prediction? Does it only refer to dynamic/temporal link prediction (formulated as the binary edge/node-pair classification) as negative sampling is usually adopted for link prediction? In contrast, dynamic link property prediction can sometimes be formulated as multi-class edge/node-pair classification.\n  \nIn Table 1, how to compute the 'top $K$ destination nodes with the most interactions in the previous $N$ interactions in the temporal graph'? It is recommended to add a simple toy example or pseudo-code to demonstrate such a procedure.\n  \nAs I known, temporal/dynamic link prediction usually includes the transductive and inductive settings. It is also unclear which setting(s) did the authors consider in this study.\n\n***\n\n**W2. The intuitions and motivations of some significant statements are weak or unclear.**\n  \nIn Section 2, why the percentage of perfect 1.0 scores for top $K$ destination nodes with most interactions in previous $N$ interactions can indicates that 'recently globally popular destination nodes have frequently oversaturated scores'? What does the 'score' refer to? It is suggested to add some more intuitive interpretations.\n  \nGlobal temporal dynamics is a significant concept of this study. However, after reading the whole paper, I still fail to understand what is global temporal dynamics due to the lack of formal definitions and intuitive examples. What kinds of features can be defined as global temporal dynamics? Are there any concrete examples in real dynamic graphs? Accordingly, what kinds of features can be defined as local temporal dynamics?\n  \nWhy Wasserstein metric (i.e., Earth Mover\u2019s distance) can be used to measure global temporal dynamics (e.g., based on what properties of this metric)? The formal definition of this metric is also not given.\n  \nIn the 1st paragraph of Section 4, why we can reach the conclusion that 'recently globally popular destination nodes can be good candidates' (e.g., compared with what)?\n  \nIn summary, due to the aforementioned issues, I still cannot understand why 'temporal graph models fail to capture global temporal dynamics' as stated in the tile of this paper.\n\n***  \n\n**W3. The overall presentation is poor.**\n  \nIn Table 1, it is unclear what do the underlined results indicate.\n  \nIn the 2nd paragraph of Page 3 and the 1st paragraph of Page 4, it is unclear what does 'Figure 3.1' refer to. There are no Figure 3.1 in the paper.\n  \nThe definitions of the numbers in Fig. 1 (e.g., 1.78e-05, 4.08e-08, etc.) are not given. It is also similar for Fig. 2. The text of the x- and y-axis in Fig. 1 and 2 are too small, which are hard to read.\n  \nIn Table 2, why there are some missing results (denoted as '-')?\n  \nIn the caption of Table 2, the authors claimed that the 'best results are underlined and bold, second best are bold'. It seems that there is a minor error. It is unclear whether the best results are underlined or in bold. \n  \nThe term 'dynamic link property prediction' is used in the title of Section 4 but 'dynamic link prediction' is used in the title of Section 5, which seems to be inconsistent.\n  \nIn Table 3, it is unclear what do the underlined and bold results indicate.\n  \nThere are no literature reviews (e.g., usually in an independent section) regarding existing related work."

                    "value": "1) The paper needs more iterations to improve the writing style and the structure. It is not easy to follow.\n2) The authors start the paper by introducing with the challenges and limitations of the benchmark dataset and existing models. This specific part need more attention. It is the core of the paper and it is very brief. A better listing of the limitations/challenges is needed. A related work section will help to better list those limitations. The works mentioned for the comparison (but other works too) would need to be included in the related work. This would help to motivate the importance of this analysis/study.\n3) Overall, this work is not very original. I think it would be a better fit for a survey paper, where more details on the methods and the limitations will be reported and a more extensive comparison of the state of the art methods in each dataset will be included. The novelty of the proposed models is also limited.\n4) The experimental analysis would be more informative if more evaluation metrics are included. The authors here include only MRR. \n5) In Section 5, the sample size is very limited for the evaluation, a bigger size would be more convincing on the findings."

                    "value": "The authors can comment in my previous listed points if they would like to.\nSome more comments for the paper:\n- When the term measures is first mentioned, I would expect a more emphasis on a definition and a motivation on why we need these measures and how those will help us choose a link prediction model based on the \"measures\" of the dataset that we would like to experiment with.\n- In Table 1, most details are missing, some of them are mentioned in the text (where the table 1 is being referred to). It would be useful to add those details in the table legend as well. For example, details and descriptions for K, N, scores, coin, and comment should also be included in the Table too.\n- Table 3 should be placed closer to the text that it is being referenced."
