Not clear why the concatenation mechanism is directly employed to fuse homogeneous representation and heterogeneous representations to obtain final representations for downstream tasks. What would be the impact on the performance of the method if other fusion methods were used, such as average pooling? The authors could add such ablation studies.\n\nThanks for your constructive suggestions. In the revision, to study the impact of the fusion mechanism, we investigated the performance of the proposed method with different fusion mechanisms (i.e., average pooling, max pooling, mix pooling, and concatenation) and reported the results in Table 12 in Appendix E.8. Obviously, the concatenation mechanism obtains the superior results. This indicates that the proposed method requires only a very simple fusion mechanism (e.g., concatenation) to achieve good performance without the need for complex fusion operations.\n\n> **W2**. It would be better to add some details of experiments. For example, the detailed information of all datasets used in this paper.\n\nIn the manuscript, the detailed information of all datasets is listed in Table 3 in Appendix D.1.\n\n> **Q1**. The effectiveness of the proposed HERO and other comparison methods are evaluated through two downstream tasks, namely, node classification and similarity search. What are the significant distinctions between these tasks?\n\nThere are major differences between them. The node classification is a semi-supervised task, while the similarity search is an unsupervised task. Specifically, node classification focuses on whether each node is correctly categorized on its own, while similarity search focuses on the ratio of possessing the same label within the most similar node pairs.\n\n> **Q2**. Theorem 2.3 does not constrain the type of downstream tasks. Does it mean that the proposed method is expected to achieve better performance on different downstream tasks, compared to the methods considering the homogeneity only?\n\nYes, we don\u2019t constrain the type of downstream tasks in Theorem 2.3. That is, the proposed method is expected to introduce more task-related information for different downstream tasks, and thus benefit their performance, compared to previous SHGL methods. This is further verified in the Experiment section of the manuscript."

The proposed method seems to yield overall smaller improvements on homogeneous graph datasets than on heterogeneous graph datasets when compared to comparative methods.\n\nThe reason can be attributed to the fact that the proposed method is designed for the heterogeneous graph. Specifically, the proposed method maintains the task-related information of the heterogeneity and homogeneity for the heterogeneous graph, while there is no heterogeneity in the homogeneous graph. However, even for the homogeneous graph datasets, the proposed method still obtains competitive performance, compared to the comparison methods.\n\n> **Q1**. The idea of capturing the homogeneity from the subspace and nearby neighbors is interesting. Can it be used in other related domains, such as computer vision?\n\nYes, it can be easily used in other domains. Take the image recognition as an example, the homogeneity from the subspace and nearby neighbors can be used to capture the relationships among different patches of an image.\n\n> **Q2**. Why replace the heterogeneous encoder with GCN to implement the proposed method on homogeneous graph datasets? What happens if the heterogeneous encoder is replaced with other similar encoders, e.g., GAT?\n\nBecause the heterogeneous encoder is used to deal with multiple node types in the heterogeneous graph, while there is only one node type in the homogeneous graph. Therefore, we follow previous self-supervised works and select GCN as the encoder to obtain node representations for the homogeneous graph. In the revision, to study the impact of encoders in the proposed method, we investigated the performance of variant methods using different encoders (i.e., GCN and GAT) and reported the results in Table 11 in Appendix E.7. The results indicate that the variant methods with GCN encoder and GAT encoder show similar performance on all datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method is robust to different encoders on the homogeneous graph."

The proposed method uses the same projection head to map homogeneous and heterogeneous representations into the same potential space. What are the implications of using two projection heads to map homogeneous and heterogeneous representations separately?\n\nIn the revision, to verify the effectiveness of the projection head, we investigated the performance of variant methods with the same projection head and different projection heads, respectively, and reported the results in Table 10 in Appendix E.6. Obviously, the variant method with the same projection head obtains the best performance.

There are several advantages of the proposed method compared to popular self-supervised methods on homogeneous graphs that require data augmentation. First, the performance of existing augmentation-based methods is highly dependent on the choice of augmentation scheme, while our method does not need carefully designed augmentation techniques. Second, the self-expressive matrix used in this work is able to capture the homophily among nodes more comprehensively than other methods that use augmentation techniques."

Homogeneity (single node/edge type) and homophily (connected nodes tend to have the same class label) are two different concepts.\n2. Overall, many of the arguments proposed by the authors sound far-fetched. It also seems that the authors take many things for granted.\n    1. Some claims of the authors are not true. For example:\n        - \"previous SHGL methods generally overlook or cannot effectively utilize the heterogeneity.\" Many existing SHGL methods, such as metapath2vec, can capture the heterogeneity. All those GNN-based SHGL methods can also capture both aspects as long as they employ heterogeneous GNN models.\n        - \"metapaths are employed to capture the homogeneity in the heterogeneous graph.\" Actually, many SHGL methods also leverage metapaths to capture the heterogeneity, such as metapath2vec, which applies DeepWalk to the node sequences (containing multiple types of nodes) generated by the pre-defined metapath.\n    2. Unclear benefit of mining heterogeneity. The example given in the introduction section is hard to understand.\n    4. Missing formal definitions for some important terminologies, including homogeneity, heterogeneity, and homogeneity rate.\n    5. Missing derivations or theorem proof for some HERO components, including Equation (10) and Equation (11).\n    6. The observations stated in Section 2.3 come with no supporting evidence.\n3. Missing important baseline: metapath2vec."

Is it to train a linear classifier (e.g., SVM) on top of (frozen) representations learnt by self-supervised methods?\n2. Metapaths can also associate two nodes with different node types. The definition of metapaths given on page 3 is therefore misleading. It's just many GNN-based methods tend to use the same-type version to construct homogeneous graphs.\n3. The idea of this paper is kind of similar to DHGCN [1], which also explicitly and separately aggregates heterogeneous neighbors (heterogeneity) and metapath-guided same-type neighbors (homogeneity).\n4. Definition 2.1 is currently hard to understand. The sentence \"if the conditions ... hold\" may need to be changed to \"if $|c_{ik}-c_{jk}|\\rightarrow 0$ ($\\forall 1 \\leq k \\leq F^\\prime$) hold for every $v_i, v_j$ satisfying $v_i \\rightarrow v_j$ (i.e., $||x_i-x_j||_2 \\rightarrow 0$)\"\n5. It would be better to also visualize the self-expressive matrix, to show that it indeed captures homogeneity/homophily.\n\n[1] Saurav Manchanda, Da Zheng, George Karypis: Schema-Aware Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Heterogeneous Graphs.

The authors confuse homogeneity and homophily, which impairs the technical soundness of this paper. The definition of homogeneity in the paper is more like homophily. Homogeneity (single node/edge type) and homophily (connected nodes tend to have the same class label) are two different concepts.\n\nThanks for the constructive comments. In the revision, we replaced \"homogeneity\" with \"homophily\".\n\n> **W2**. Overall, many of the arguments proposed by the authors sound far-fetched. It also seems that the authors take many things for granted.\n\n> **W2-1**. Some claims of the authors are not true. \n**(1)** \u201cprevious SHGL methods generally overlook or cannot eff ectively utilize the heterogeneity.\" Many existing SHGL methods, such as metapath2vec, can capture the heterogeneity. All those GNN-based SHGL methods can also capture both aspects as long as they employ heterogeneous GNN models. **(2)** \u201cmetapaths are employed to capture the homogeneity in the heterogeneous graph.\" Actually, many SHGL methods also leverage metapaths to capture the heterogeneity.\n\n**(1)** In the revision, we changed it to \"most previous SHGL methods overlook or cannot effectively utilize the heterogeneity\" for a more precise claim.\n\nActually, according to previous literature [1,2,3,4], random walk based methods (e.g., metapath2vec) are generally summarized as traditional unsupervised heterogeneous graph learning methods. Compared to the currently popular self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning methods, the traditional unsupervised heterogeneous graph learning method metapath2vec ignores the rich information in the node features and thus obtains inferior performance. \n\nMoreover, as the reviewer mentioned,  the SHGL methods can capture both the homophily and heterogeneity in the heterogeneous graph as long as they employ heterogeneous GNN models. However, current mainstream SHGL frameworks (e.g., [1,2,3,4,5]) usually only use GCN to obtain node representations based on metapaths, thus **ignoring** heterogeneity. Although very few SHGL methods (e.g., HeCo [6]) employ heterogeneous GNN models, they **cannot effectively** utilize the heterogeneity. The reason is that HeCo directly aligns the heterogeneous representations and homophily representations to lose specific task-related information within each of them. In the manuscript, we discussed and summarized their differences in the Related Work. \n\nFinally, we would like to reiterate our innovative nature and contributions, which are not only simply capturing the homophily and heterogeneity like previous SHGL methods.\nFirst, the proposed method comprehensively captures the homophily from both the subspace and nearby neighbors without pre-defined meta-paths. However, previous methods (including metapath2vec, HeCo, and other SHGL methods) need pre-defined meta-paths, thus introducing extra expert knowledge and computational costs. \nSecond, the proposed method extracts the consistent information and the specific information between homophilous and heterogeneous representations to introduce more task-related information. In contrast, most previous SHGL methods ignore the heterogeneity or cannot effectively utilize it.\n\n[1] Zhu Y, Xu Y, Cui H, et al. Structure-enhanced heterogeneous graph contrastive learning.

In this case, it is difficult to distinguish these two authors. In contrast, if we utilize the heterogeneity, i.e., considering both the author nodes and the other type of nodes (e.g., each author's published papers), we can easily distinguish them with the same name from their published papers."

Missing formal definitions for some important terminologies, including homogeneity, heterogeneity, and homogeneity rate.\n\nIn the revision, we added the definitions of homophily ratio, homophily mining, and heterogeneity mining in Appendix C.1.\n\n\n> **W2-4**. Missing derivations or theorem proof for some HERO components, including Equation (10) and Equation (11).\n\nIn the revision, we  added the theoretical analysis for the consistency loss in Eq. (10) and the specificity loss in Eq. (11) and reported them in Appendix C.5.\n\nBased on these theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the consistency loss and the specificity loss extract the consistent information between homophilous representations and heterogeneous representations and maintain their specific information, respectively.\n\n\n\n> **W2-5**.  The observations stated in Section 2.3 come with no supporting evidence.\n\nTo support two observations in Section 2.3, we provide more insights about them. \n\nHomophilous representations and heterogeneous representations share the same original node features, so they are intuitive to share the same information, the consistent information for short in this work. \n\nThe homophilous representations focus on aggregating the information from nodes of the same class, while the heterogeneous representations focus on aggregating the information from nodes of different types. Obviously, homophilous representations and heterogeneous representations have different focuses, so we call them to contain specific information for each of them. \n\nTake the academic heterogeneous graph with several node types (e.g., paper, author, and subject) as an example, and each paper collects its abstract as the original node features. After that, the homophilous representations of each paper aggregate the information from other papers that may come from the same class, while the heterogeneous representations aggregate the information of nodes from other types (i.e., author and subject). Therefore, the homophilous representations of each paper consist of two parts, i.e., the original features (i.e., abstract) information of the paper and the information from other papers. The heterogeneous representations of each paper also consist of two parts, i.e., the same abstract information of the paper and the information from authors and subjects. In this example, the original features (i.e., abstract) information of each paper can be regarded as the consistent information, while the information from other papers and the information from authors and subjects can be regarded as the specific information within homophilous representations and heterogeneous representations, respectively.\n\n> **W3**. Missing important baseline: metapath2vec.\n\nIn the revision, we added the metapath2vec as one of the baselines, and reported the results in the comparison experiments.\n\n> **Q1**. What is the evaluation protocol for HERO and other baselines? Is it to train a linear classifier (e.g., SVM) on top of (frozen) representations learnt by self-supervised methods?\n\nYes. We follow the standard evaluation protocol according to previous self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning works [7,8,9]. \n\nSpecifically, we first train models with unlabeled data in a self-supervised manner and output the learned node representations. After that, the resulting representations are used to train a simple logistic regression classifier with a fixed iteration number. \n\n[7] Park C, Kim D, Han J, et al.

Metapaths can also associate two nodes with different node types. The definition of metapaths given on page 3 is therefore misleading. It's just many GNN-based methods tend to use the same-type version to construct homogeneous graphs.\n\nIn the revision, we revised the  definition of metapaths given on Page 3. Specifically, given the heterogeneous graph, the meta-path can be defined in the form of $v_{1} \\stackrel{r_{1}}{\\rightarrow} v_{2} \\stackrel{r_{2}}{\\rightarrow} \\cdots \\stackrel{r_{s}}{\\rightarrow} v_{s+1}$.  It is a sequence of a composite relation $r_{1} \\circ r_{2} \\circ \\cdots \\circ r_{s}$ between node $v_1$ and node $v_{s+1}$, where  $s$ indicates the length of meta-path and $\\circ$ denotes the composition operator."

The idea of this paper is kind of similar to DHGCN, which also explicitly and separately aggregates heterogeneous neighbors (heterogeneity) and metapath-guided same-type neighbors (homogeneity).\n\nDHGCN is proposed to separately aggregate heterogeneity and homophily to conduct semi-supervised learning (i.e., requiring node labels), while our method is self-supervised learning (i.e., only requiring self-supervised signals). In addition, we list other differences as follows. \n\nFirst, DHGCN still needs meta-paths to capture the homophily in the heterogeneous graph, which requires extra expert knowledge and computational costs. In contrast, the proposed method comprehensively captures the homophily from both the subspace and nearby neighbors without pre-defined meta-paths.\n\nSecond, DHGCN simply puts the homophilous representations and heterogeneous representations together without considering consistent and specific information. In contrast, the proposed method is available to extract the consistent information and the specific information between homophilous and heterogeneous representations.\n\n\n> **Q4**. Definition 2.1 is currently hard to understand. The sentence ``if the conditions ... hold\" may need to be changed.\n\nIn the revision, we changed Definition 2.1 based on your suggestions.\n\n\n> **Q5**. It would be better to also visualize the self-expressive matrix, to show that it indeed captures homogeneity/homophily.\n\nIn the revision, to verify that the self-expressive matrix indeed captures the homophily, we visualized the self-expressive matrix heatmaps of ACM and Yelp datasets in Figure 6 in Appendix E.6, where rows and columns are reordered by node labels.\nIn the heatmaps, the darker a pixel, the larger the value of self-expressive matrix weight. Based on Figure 6, the heatmaps exhibit a similar block diagonal structure with the correlation map of homophilous representations. This indicates that the self-expressive matrix assigns large weights for nodes within the same class and small weights for nodes from different classes to describe each node. Therefore, the self-expressive matrix indeed captures the homophily in the heterogeneous graph."

It points out two main issues: reliance on human-defined meta-paths, and underutilization of graph heterogeneity. To tackle these, the authors propose a method that captures homogeneity without predefined meta-paths using a self-expressive matrix. Additionally, they capture heterogeneity by aggregating information from different node types. Two losses are introduced to ensure consistency between homogeneity and heterogeneity and to preserve task-related information. Theoretical analysis suggests the learned representations effectively capture homogeneity and introduce more task-related information.

Complexity and Computational Cost: The paper doesn't extensively discuss the computational complexity and resource requirements of the proposed method, leaving potential concerns about its scalability in large-scale applications, especially the comparison with traditional meta-path-based approaches.\n\nIn the manuscript, the time complexity of our method and the training time cost of all self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning (SHGL) methods are reported in Appendix B.2 and Appendix E.1, respectively. In the revision, we further reported the memory cost of all SHGL methods in Appendix E.1. \n\nSpecifically, the time complexity of our method is linear to the sample size, while traditional meta-path-based SHGL methods (e.g., [1,2,3,4]) generally are quadratic to the sample size.  \n\nIn our manuscript,  we evaluated the proposed method and all SHGL methods on one large dataset of knowledge graph (i.e., Freebase with 180,098 nodes and  1,645,725 edges) in terms of classification results and the training time cost in Figure 4(a) in Appendix E.1. In the revision, we added experiments on the memory cost and report in Figure 4(b) in Appendix E.1.\nAs a result,  the proposed method achieves the best performance,  minimal training time cost, and minimal memory cost on the Freebase dataset. This further verifies the scalability and efficiency of the proposed method on the large-scale dataset. \n\n[1] Park C, Kim D, Han J, et al. Unsupervised attributed multiplex network embedding.

The whole workflow is a little complicated, which may raise concerns about reproducibility.\n\nOur proposed workflow is very simple because its key part (i.e., obtaining the homophilous representations with the self-expressive matrix) was implemented with 8 lines of codes. Moreover, in the manuscript, we provided source code and datasets for reproducibility.\n\n\n> **W3**. Some important works missing.\n\nThanks for your advice. In the revision, we discussed  these excellent works in the Related Work.\n\n> **Q1**. For section 2.1 (homogeneity), I wonder what the compared results between a message-passing GNN via such a complex self-expressive matrix and the one via graph transformer (learnable self-attention).\n\nIn the manuscript, we analyzed the difference between self-expressive mechanism and self-attention mechanism in Appendix A.3. In the revision, we further compared self-attention mechanism (i.e., graph transformer)  with our self-expressive mechanism and reported the results in Table 9 in Appendix E.\n\nAs a result, the self-expressive mechanism outperforms the self-attention mechanism on all datasets. The reason can be summarized as follows. First, the weights of the self-attention mechanism are non-negative, while the weights of the self-expressive mechanism are real values. Therefore, our self-expressive matrix can capture both the positive relationships among nodes within the same class and the negative relationships among nodes from different classes. Second, our self-expressive matrix is encouraged to focus on the most relevant neighbors of each sample instead of arbitrary nodes as in the self-attention mechanism. Therefore, the self-expressive matrix focuses more on the neighbors of each node within the same class and less on its faraway nodes that may come from different classes.\n\n> **Q2**. I wonder about the scalability and efficiency of real-world datasets.\n\nPlease see our response in R1.\n\n> **Q3**.  It seems the whole workflow for node classification is not an end-to-end pipeline, the author first uses their framework to pre-train the model and then they use the learned model for specific node classification. I wonder what's the detailed settings for their task head for the node classification task.\n\nYes, it is not an end-to-end pipeline. We followed the standard workflow in previous self-supervised heterogeneous graph learning works [1,2,3]. \n\nSpecifically, similar to [1,2,3], we first pre-train models with unlabeled data and output learned node representations, and then input the learned node representations into  a simple logistic regression for training a classifier. \n\n[1] Park C, Kim D, Han J, et al.

Interpretability: Although the traditional meta-path approach may have some shortcomings as mentioned by the authors, there is no doubt that these methods are very intuitive for human understanding and explanation. I wonder how the interpretability of the learned representations is. Can the authors provide more insights into how the model's representations can be interpreted, aiding researchers and practitioners in understanding its decision-making process?\n\nAs the reviewer stated, the meta-path based methods are intuitive for human understanding and explanation. That is, two nodes connected by the meta-paths generally tend to belong to the same class and have similar representations. So does our method. For example, in our method, the nodes within the same class have similar representations. We interpreted the result of our method in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) in our manuscript. \n\nIn the manuscript, we  visualized the node correlation maps of ACM and Yelp datasets in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), where rows and columns are reordered by node labels. In the correlation map, the darker a pixel, the higher the correlation between nodes. In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), the correlation maps exhibit a block diagonal structure where the nodes of each block belong to the same class. This indicates that if two nodes belong to the same class, then the correlation of their representations will be high, i.e., their representations are expected to be similar. This shows the interpretability of the learned representations."
