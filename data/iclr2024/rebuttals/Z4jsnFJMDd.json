A pre-trained version, SAMixP, is also provided to reduce computational costs and improve generalizability."

The paper argues that such a setup can be treated as a optimizing for local smoothness versus global discrimination, respectively; however has two shortcomings: i) it is prone to trivial solutions and ii) lower empirical performances in self-supervised learning situations. To this end, the paper suggests scenario-agnostic mix (SAMix) that implements three ideas: a) learns the mixing ratio \\lambda, b) avoids trivial solutions via non-linear content modeling (eq. 9), and c) expensive compute for online training via using pre-trained models. Experiments are provided on 12 tasks and demonstrate some promise."

                    "value": "The paper needs a thorough revision for clarity and technical correctness, and preciseness in the assumptions it is making. Some suggestions are provided below to consider when revising.\n1. It is unclear to me what exactly is meant by \"scenario\" in the paper? Is it class or instances? Where exactly is the \"agnostic\" part coming in? \n2. The main hypothesis in the paper is that mixup generation can be treated as a sum of local and global terms (Sec. 3.1). But it appears that which one is local and which is global is not quite clear from the exposition. For example, the paper writes \"the local term centers around classes, while global term is across classes\". Then writes \"\\ell^CE is a global term\" and then writes \"at the class level, to emphasize the local term, we introduce binary cross-entropy loss pBCE\". Further, in Eq. 4, the paper assume access to the labels y_i and y_j, and so does for the NCE loss in Eq. 5, which is supposed to be label free (as described earlier in the Preliminaries)? \n\n3. In Sec 3.2, Eq. 7 is claimed to be an adaptive mixing factor \\lambda, but it is not about updating lambda. Further, the findings in Sec 3.2, which is essentially the main contributions of the paper, the observations are only empirical and the insights are not substantiated in any rigorous manner. The fixes, such as adaptive \\lambda, non-linear content modeling, etc. are only treated superficially and it is not clear to me why it makes sense or how is the particular formulation justified. For example, the paper writes \"it may be unstable to project high-dimensional features to 1-dim linearly\", which the paper claims to be the reason for trivial solutions, and the offering is to use two 1x1 convolution layers with a batch regularization and ReLU. \n\n\nOther comments:\na. f_\\theta(x): x->z. Typically, x and z are replaced by their domains not their variables. Also, the domain of z is not defined. Is it d_c? Do you assume each class has a separate dimension? \n\nb. \"closed-loop framework\": how is it closed loop? \n\nc. Please double check Eq. 1; it is incorrect. The lambdas should go inside \\ell^CE I believe.\n\nd. Why do you use the same \\lambda for \\ell^NCE and \\ell^CE (e.g. in eq.1 and eq. 2), when they look at instance level and class level losses? For that matter, what precisely is meant by parametric loss and non-parametric loss for \\ell^CE  and \\ell^NCE, respectively? When adding these two losses in the same objective (e.g., Eq. 3), how do you ensure it is optimized correctly, as NCE loss I believe do not assume knowledge of the class labels, while CE loss discriminates classes? The term L^{cls} is undefined. What is the precise form for M_\\phi, and how is z_i, z_j used? \n\ne. \"SSL framework can easily fall into a trivial solution\". This is a strong statement and is mostly an empirical observation. It would useful to provide a more technical insight to the reason for this. \n\nOverall, this paper needs a thorough revision for language and technical clarity. As is, the contributions appear as minor hacks to improve performance."

Can the authors provide a similar analysis on time for SSL experiments ? \n\nClarity and presentation:\n- There are many small (potential) typos, grammatical errors or sentences which should be rephrased and are not apt for a professional paper. The paper needs a thorough rewrite to fix these issues. That said, I consider most of these as minor issues and do not play a big role in my current score. \n- The more pressing concern is that the paper has numerous clarity concerns. Even distilling the main crux of the sentence is difficult at times. Many sentences are \"hand-wavy\". Some examples:\n    - Section 1:\n        - \"they still do not ... scenarios\" - too convoluted. This is a problem since this is likely the most important sentence to motivate the introduction (and the idea). No intuition on trivial solutions. \n        - [Minor] Figure 1 : Too many variants make this difficult to interpret. Make sure that fig1 and fig2 caption are easy to demarcate.\n    - Section 2:\n        - \"Here we consider .. framework\". Unclear.\n        - \"Symmetrically\" has been used too loosely in the entire paper. \n        - The paragraph between (1) and (2) suddenly switches to InfoNCE. Separate these. \n        - Notation Page (3) : $z_m$ not defined, define \"augmentation view\". Unclear \".. not from the same view..\"\n        - \"unlike .. in Sec 2\" - this sentence is still a part of Sec 2. \n        - Abrupt change from $z_m$ back to discussing $x_m$\n        - \"depends on quality of mixup generation\" - motivation unclear till this point. All I get from this para is that you want to train a model to mix. What are we missing by using heuristics to generate $x_m$ ?\n        - What is the difference between $\\mathcal{L}^{gen}$ and $\\mathcal{L}^{phi}$ and $\\mathcal{L}^{cls}$\n    - Section 3:\n       - \"Typically .. parametric training\" - what does this mean ? \n       - Intuitions for (4) and (5) ? What does the proposed BCE loss do ? What are the variables being optimized ?\n       - Again, the section on \"balancing local and global..\" is not well written, intuitions are not clear. I suggest shortening this and moving empirical results from this to the experiments section to improve flow of the paper.
