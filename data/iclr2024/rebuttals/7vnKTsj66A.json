                    "value": "This paper studies instance discrimination-based self-supervised learning, where several augmented views are pulled together and negative samples are pushed away from each other. One of the key challenges is the difficulty in determining positive and negative samples precisely. To this end, the authors propose to assign pseudo-labels for each instance and prove that those pseudo-labels are unbounded. Under such a setting, the authors further come up with a robust learning paradigm that manages to model the dynamic relationship precisely. Empirical evaluation on several self-supervised benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Referring to instance discrimination (ID) as SSL is somewhat an overstatement. I recognize that the scope of this paper is the theoretical analysis of ID-based SSL methods, but there also exists a wide range of other SSL methods such as masked autoencoding [A, B], predictive learning [C, D], and image colorizing [E]. It is better to replace SSL with ID.\n\n2. This paper contains some overclaims. The authors claim that the proposed method manages to \"model the dynamic relationship *precisely*\". Similar claims appear frequently in this paper. However, it is almost impossible without ground-truths.\n\n\nReferences\n\n[A] K. He et al. Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners.

                    "value": "1. The main concern is the formulation of the objective function Eq. (7) and the corresponding update rules: The constraint requires $f, f_{ph}$ to minimize $\\mathcal{L}\\_{PAR}$, which sets $f, f\\_{ph}$ to the global minimizer, while the outer objective requires them to be minimizer of $\\mathcal{L}\\_{align} + \\mathcal{L}\\_{prior}$. It is not a bi-level optimization problem but a combination of two problems. As a result, it is hard to determine whether the update rules are reasonable.\n2. At the beginning of Sec. 4.3, it is claimed that the mislabeling rate can approach 1, however, according to Theorem 4.1 we can only conclude that the misleading rate is greater than 0.\n3. In Theorem 4.2, $g(\\sigma) \\rightarrow \\infty$ as $\\sigma \\rightarrow 0$ is not obvious since both the numerator and denominator tend to 0. Please provide more details.\n4. The novelty of the proposed Precise Adjustment Regularization (PAR) needs more explanation. It seems that $\\mathcal{L}_{PAR}$ directly uses the discretized similarity as pseudo labels. Besides, the motivation for using moving average predictions as pseudo labels seems unclear.\n5. In Sec. 6.2, the objective $\\mathcal{L}\\_{SSL} + \\mathcal{L}\\_{PAR}$ is shown to be less effective than the iterative update. However, the computational cost of the iterative update is double according to my understanding. Therefore, it should be compared under the same computational cost for a fair comparison."

For instance, SSL methods tend to focus on combining augmented samples from the same ancestral source, while ignoring the combination of augmented samples derived from ancestor samples that ***have the same labels***. To tackle this problem, the authors proposed a new SSL mechanism that generates pseudo-labels to guide learning, thereby reducing label space inconsistencies and improving the robustness of SSL with pseudo-labels' noise at the early stage of learning. The authors also integrated PAR with existing SSL methods to induce better representations and tested their framework on various tasks. The findings revealed that their approach significantly enhanced the performance of existing SSL methods."

It would be helpful to provide more examples to clarify the challenge presented in the introduction.\n* I recommend including a formal mathematical definition when introducing the concept of pseudo-label generation, specifically in the context of discussing both the target network and online network. What exact the online network is. For example, in Section 4.4, it is suggested to move the formula for generating pseudo-labels earlier in the discussion.\n* Further clarification and details are required to support the PAR regarding the $out$ function introduced in Eq. 5.\n* This paper can be challenging to follow because of its excessively long sentences."
