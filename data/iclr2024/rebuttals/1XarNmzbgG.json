                    "value": "**1**, Regarding The Distribution of $Q$ and $P$.\n\nOverall, I have some doubts about the distribution of the auxiliary dataset. \nWhile there are some server-assisted FL (SA-FL) works following similar ideas, it can be too ideal to assume the server has an auxiliary dataset that has the same distribution of $P$, or even *positively-related* with P.\nUsually, in standard FL, the server does not have any prior knowledge about the dataset. Such a setup comes from real concerns regarding data privacy.\nHowever, SA-FL comes with a requirement for an auxiliary dataset that has a similar distribution as the target dataset. \nIt is doubtful that the server can have ways to acquire such an auxiliary dataset without breaching privacy promises. \n\n**2**, Regarding The Analysis of FL with Incomplete Participation.\n\n**2.1**, Definition 3 is very unclear. *Excess error* in Definition 3 is an important component in the analysis. However, it is not properly defined throughout the whole paper.\n\n**2.2**, Theorem 1 is stated in a general way, but the proof seems a simplified case. Throughout the proof of Theorem 1, it seems a special case with only two points $x1, x2$. \nAs a reader, I am concerned about how it extends to general cases with an arbitrary number of points.\n\n**2.3**, Theorem 2 is not clearly stated. First, it states Eq(1) holds with probability at least $1-\\delta$. However, it is confusing how the $\\delta$ is derived and how it relates to Eq(1). If $\\delta$ is not in Eq(1), what is the point of having such a variable?\n\nAnother issue of Theorem 2 is that the $\\alpha$ parameter in Assumption 2 is not shown up in Eq(1) either. It is strange. Imaging a very large $\\alpha$ to bound the similarly of distribution $P$ and $Q$, then Theorem 2 implies that the error $\\varepsilon$ is still small and is only decided by $\\beta$. It does not make sense to me. \n\n**2.4**, The assumption, $\\hat{R}(\\hat{h}) \\leq \\hat{R}(h^*)$, in Theorem 3 need further justification. As a reader, I do not see why the assumption is valid. \n\n**3**, Regarding The Evaluation Setup. \n\n**3.1**, For the auxiliary dataset on the server, the authors simply extract a subset of the target training dataset. \nIt is expected that it can give better performance compared to the training without the subset. \nHowever, the question is, it is an unfair comparison. SAFARI allows the server to access a subset of the target training dataset, thereby breaking privacy promises in FL. It is unfair to use model accuracy as the sole criterion to compare with FedAvg. \n\n**3.2**, The central question is again how to attain the auxiliary dataset for the server training. To have a fair comparison, I believe the authors need to find auxiliary samples that are independent of the target dataset such as other public sources or generated samples."

To address this issue, the Server-Assisted Federated Learning (SA-FL) approach has been introduced, which involves incorporating an additional server-side dataset. Empirical evidence has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach. This work aims to explore the theoretical aspects of the SA-FL approach. The study reveals that the standard Federated Learning approach is not PAC-learnable in the worst-case scenario when client participation is incomplete. To address this, the authors propose the SAFARI (Server-Assisted Federated Averaging) algorithm, providing a thorough analysis of its generalization and convergence properties. The paper also includes experimental results presented in the concluding sections."

The proof appears to be sound; however, I must note that I lack expertise in statistical learning theory, so I may have overlooked certain details.\n\nIt's worth noting that the provided proof heavily relies on prior work, and the outcome it yields does not appear to be particularly surprising. In essence, the core concept of this assertion revolves around the idea that in cases where a system lacks access to specific information (in this context, data from clients that are entirely uncommunicative), it is unfeasible to construct a model with an error rate tending towards zero. This seems to be a rather self-evident conclusion, especially when considering scenarios where such non-communicative clients possess unique and isolated data that does not intersect with the data available from other clients. In such cases, it becomes impractical to derive a model suitable for the broader data distribution.\n\nWith all due respect, the term \"fundamental\" ascribed to this result, as well as the subsequent assertion that \"This result sheds light on system and algorithm design for FL,\" might be perceived as somewhat exaggerated and overstated.\n\n> In addition to system heterogeneity, other factors such as Byzantine attackers could also render incomplete client participation. For example, even for full client participation in FL, if part of the clients are Byzantine attackers, the impossibility theorem also applies.\n\nI respectfully disagree with this statement. In the context of Byzantine robustness, we follow a standard formulation prevalent in the literature on Byzantine robustness, as evidenced by the following references:\n\nKarimireddy, S. P., He, L., & Jaggi, M. (2021, October). Byzantine-Robust Learning on Heterogeneous Datasets via Bucketing. In International Conference on Learning Representations.\n\nGorbunov, E., Horv\u00e1th, S., Richt\u00e1rik, P., & Gidel, G. (2022). Variance reduction is an antidote to byzantines: Better rates, weaker assumptions and communication compression as a cherry on the top. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.00529.\n\nWe assume that there are $n$ clients consisting of the two groups: $[n]=\\mathcal{G} \\sqcup \\mathcal{B}$, where $\\mathcal{G}$ denotes the set of good clients and $\\mathcal{B}$ is the set of bad/malicious/Byzantine workers. The goal is to solve the following optimization problem\n$$\n\\min \\_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d} f(x)=\\frac{1}{G}  \\sum\\_{i \\in \\mathcal{G}} f\\_i(x),$$\nwhere $G=|\\mathcal{G}|$. In essence, we seek to build a model solely based on data from the good clients. Therefore, we do not factor in data from Byzantine workers in our problem. As a result, the concept of incomplete client participation is not applicable to this particular scenario. If there are any aspects I may have missed, please clarify.\n\n** The PAC Learnability of Server-Assisted Federated Learning**\n\n>The intuition of SA-FL is to utilize a dataset $T$ i.i.d. sampled from distribution $P$ with cardinality $|T|=n_T$ as a vehicle to correct potential distribution deviations due to incomplete client participation. By doing so, the server steers the learning by a small number of representative data, while the clients assist the learning by federation to leverage the huge amount of privately decentralized data $\\left(n_S \\gg n_T\\right)$. Note that the assumption of having a server-side dataset is not restrictive since such datasets are already available in many FL systems: although not always necessary for training, an auxiliary dataset is often needed for defining FL tasks (e.g., simulation prototyping) before training and model checking after training (e.g., quality evaluation and sanity checking) (McMahan et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021a). \n\nI concur that in practical applications, the existence of server-side datasets is plausible. Nevertheless, I find it challenging to accept the assumption that the server-side dataset T is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) from the distribution P without limitations. I firmly believe that if the server-side dataset is derived from distribution P in any manner, it implies that the server must possess some level of access to data from all clients to obtain it. Gaining access to clients' raw data stands in direct opposition to the fundamental principles of Federated Learning and constitutes a severe breach of privacy. Otherwise, inherent biases may arise in the dataset. In practice, achieving a server-side dataset that is i.i.d. sampled from distribution P is often unattainable, and it may be more reasonable to consider alternative distributions or methods for constructing server-side data.\n\nCould you kindly provide more detailed information regarding this matter?\n\n>Assumption 2 specifies a stronger constraint between distributions $P$ and $Q$. It implies that the difference of excess error for one hypothesis $h \\in \\mathcal{H}$ between $P$ and $Q$ is bounded by the excess error of $Q$ in some exponential form. Assumption 2 is one of the major novelty in our paper and unseen in the literature. We note that this $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-positively-related condition is a mild condition.\n\nCould you please provide a more comprehensive explanation as to why this assumption is necessary in the analysis and elucidate its role?\n\nUpon reviewing the proof for Theorem 3, it becomes apparent that it heavily relies on the assumption that the dataset T is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d) from the distribution P. I would appreciate it if you could clarify the outcomes and implications in situations where the server-side dataset T is sourced from a non-i.i.d or biased distribution.\n\n>Last but not least, it is worth pointing out that, for ease of illustration, Theorem $2-3$ are based on the assumption that the auxiliary dataset $T \\stackrel{i . i . d .}{\\sim} P$. Nonetheless, it is of practical importance to consider the scenario where $T$ is sampled from a related but slightly different distribution $P^{\\prime}$ rather than the target distribution $P$ itself. In fact, the above assumption could be relaxed to $T \\stackrel{i . i . d .}{\\sim} P^{\\prime}$ for any $P^{\\prime}$ as long as the mixture distribution $Q=\\lambda_1 D+\\lambda_2 P^{\\prime}$ is $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-positively-related with $P$. Under such condition, we can show that the main results in Theorem 2-3 continue to hold.\n\nCan you please characterize the difference between distribution $P$ and $P^{\\prime}$ such that mixture distribution $Q=\\lambda_1 D+\\lambda_2 P^{\\prime}$ is $(\\alpha, \\beta)$-positively-related with $P$? \n\n**THE SAFARI ALGORITHM FOR TRAINING UNDER SA-FL**\n\nAssumption 5 appears to be rather restrictive, as it necessitates the bound to hold for all $i$ in the range $[M]$, and the overall expression is constrained by a constant. I would like to propose a more general assumption:\n\n$$\\frac{1}{G} \\sum\\_{i \\in \\mathcal{G}}\\left\\Vert\\nabla f\\_i(x)-\\nabla f(x)\\right\\Vert^2 \\leq B\\Vert\\nabla f(x)\\Vert^2+\\zeta^2 \\quad \\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d.$$\n\nIt's worth noting that this assumption is a standard concept well-documented in the existing literature.\n\nKarimireddy, S. P., Kale, S., Mohri, M., Reddi, S., Stich, S., & Suresh, A. T. (2020, November). Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning.

Variance reduction is an antidote to byzantines: Better rates, weaker assumptions and communication compression as a cherry on the top. arXiv preprint arXiv:2206.00529.\n\n\nI have significant concerns regarding Theorem 4. Firstly, the constants, where $G_1=\\min_{r\\in\\mathcal{T}s}\\left\\Vert\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}r)\\right\\Vert^2$ and $G_2=\\min{r\\in\\mathcal{T}c}\\left\\Vert\\frac{1}{m}\\sum{i\\in[m]}\\sum{k\\in[K]}\\nabla F_i(\\mathbf{x}_{r,k}^i)\\right\\Vert^2$, do not provide any information regarding their potential magnitudes. These constants necessitate the calculation of the minimum among server iterates for $G_1$ and the minimum among client iterates for $G_2$. Including such terms in the convergence bound is impractical, both in theory and practice, as estimating these constants is infeasible.\n\nUpon reviewing the proof of Theorem 4, I observed that the analysis was conducted in a less rigorous manner. It involved bounding sums of client gradients by the minimum of such sums. Similar analytical approaches were utilized in subsequent works. In this works such sum as $\\left\\Vert\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i \\in[m]} \\sum_{k \\in[K]} \\nabla F_i\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{r, k}^i\\right)\\right\\Vert^2 $ are bounded in more rigorous way. Please clarify this aspect of the proof. \n\nMoreover, the end of proof is not correct:\n$$\n4 R\\_c \\sigma\\_G^2  \\leq \\sum\\_{r \\in T\\_s}\\left(1-L \\eta\\_s\\right)\\left\\Vert\\nabla F\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\_r\\right)\\right\\Vert^2+\\sum_{r \\in T\\_c}\\left(\\frac{4}{2 K^2}-\\frac{8 L \\eta_s}{K^2}\\right)\\left\\Vert\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i \\in[m]} \\sum\\_{k \\in[K]} \\nabla F_i\\left(\\mathbf{x}\\_{r, k}^i\\right)\\right\\Vert^2  \\leq R\\_s\\left(1-L \\eta_s\\right) G\\_1+R_c\\left(\\frac{4}{2 K^2}-\\frac{8 L \\eta\\_s}{K^2}\\right) G\\_2,\n$$\nwhere $G_1=\\min_{r\\in\\mathcal{T}s}\\left\\Vert\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}r)\\right\\Vert^2$ and $G_2=\\min{r\\in\\mathcal{T}c}\\left\\Vert\\frac{1}{m}\\sum{i\\in[m]}\\sum{k\\in[K]}\\nabla F_i(\\mathbf{x}_{r,k}^i)\\right\\Vert^2$\n\nThe term \"minimum\" should be replaced with \"maximum\" since the formula requires an upper bound. I acknowledge that this is likely a typographical error, but the criticism mentioned earlier still holds true.\n\nIt's also unclear why bounding the term $\\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{r=1}^R \\mathbb{E}\\left\\Vert\\nabla F\\left(\\mathbf{x}_r\\right)\\right\\Vert^2$ is meaningful and what it signifies.

Server-side stepsizes and sampling without replacement provably help in federated optimization. arXiv preprint arXiv:2201.11066.\n\nThe most recent paper, titled \"Server-side stepsizes and sampling without replacement provably help in federated optimization,\" delves into an algorithm closely related to the one discussed in this study, and their analytical approach bears similarities. However, it notably avoids the pitfalls associated with bounding sums by the minimum among server and client iterates.\n\nI would suggest conducting a comparative analysis of the results obtained in this study with those derived from the aforementioned relevant papers to gain a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of each approach.\n\n>Further, Theorem 4 immediately implies that, by choosing parameters $q$ and the learning rate $\\eta$ appropriately, we achieve linear convergence speedup to a stationary point:\n\nWhat is $\\eta$ in this sentence? Is this server or client stepsize? \n\n**Numerical experiments**\n\nIn this section, there is a notable absence of a comparative analysis with respect to baselines other than FedAvg. To offer a more comprehensive evaluation, it would be advantageous to include a comparison with additional baseline algorithms commonly employed in similar studies. This would provide a more holistic perspective on the performance of the proposed approach.\n\nFurthermore, to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the analysis, it is advisable to incorporate graphical representations such as plots depicting the convergence of the algorithm in terms of the loss function. Visualizing the convergence process can aid in conveying a more intuitive understanding of the algorithm's performance and highlight any distinct advantages or shortcomings it may exhibit in relation to other baselines."

Theorem 1 indicates that for any learning algorithm, there exists a distribution $P$ such that the probability of learning failure is significant ($p>0.05$). However, I wonder if this necessarily implies that no algorithm can learn a better predictor than random guessing.\n2. The framework here requires the server to collect samples that accurately reflect the underlying distribution of clients, which is usually considered impractical in federated settings, whether for privacy or communication reasons.\n3. Overall, this paper aims to address the challenge of generalization in FL . In the related work section, the authors review numerous relevant studies, including various domain adaptation techniques in FL. However, these methods or baselines seem to be mysteriously missing in the experiments.\n4. In the experiment, there are a total of $M = 10$ clients, with $m = 5$ participating in each communication round. This means that $50%$ of the clients are selected in each round, which seems inconsistent with the background introduced by this paper.\n5. How is the value of $q$ determined in the experiment? Is there any theoretical basis for this choice?\n6.
