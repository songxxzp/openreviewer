While this setup allows for a comprehensive exploration of the system's behavior, I remain unconvinced that learning a two-state automaton (TA) truly represents a meaningful real-world sequence learning challenge. I am uncertain about the extent to which the observed results can be applied to real-world datasets.\n\n- The paper concentrates on a particular RNN architecture and a specific activation function, potentially constraining the applicability of its findings to other architectures and tasks. Since learning dynamics are closely tied to the chosen RNN architecture, I believe the paper lacks comprehensiveness without addressing potential variations across RNN types. Numerous RNN architectures have been introduced that handle temporal information differently from a standard RNN (or GRU/LSTM).\n\n- In Figure 4, it's unclear which parameters and their corresponding values led to the observed bifurcation. Given that the time-dependent system in this paper relies on inputs, these inputs can also influence the Jacobian matrix and subsequently impact the stability of the fixed points over time. Therefore, additional information is required to better understand the discussed bifurcation.\n\n- Regarding the sentence (page 18) \"These trajectories are quasi-periodic but approach period P as training progresses\", it's not entirely clear how we can verify that the observed behaviors are genuinely quasi-periodic. They could also be higher-order periodic orbits converging towards a lower period P as training advances. One method to confirm this statement is to delve into the Lyapunov exponent spectra and the maximum Lyapunov exponent. Otherwise, how one can validate this assertion?"
