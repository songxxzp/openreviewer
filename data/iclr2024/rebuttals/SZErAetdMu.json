Afterwards, they employ the transformer encoder and task-specific heads for different tasks. Experimentally, the learned VQ-VAE embedding can generalize to different domains. The proposed method performs well in three different tasks."

                    "value": "1.\tAbout the presentation and citation of the method section. \n\nThe model descriptions in Section 3.2 are ambiguous. For example, in Figure 1(b) and Figure 2, they plot the Transformer structure with both encoder and decoder, while in Section 3.2, they present the XEncoder as the \u201cTime Transformer Encoder\u201d. In my understanding, they only adopt the Transformer encoder part. More explanations are required. Besides, how to apply the Transformer encoder is also unclear? I think they use attention along the token dimension, but there are no clear descriptions here. I think they should present the model architecture in Figures, just like Figure 2.\n\nThe usages of Scale Reinstater are inconsistent in different tasks. In the forecasting task, the Scale Reinstater is used to provide future mean and standard deviation, while in classification and translation, they are used for scale embedding. I don\u2019t think the usage in classification and translation can be named as \u201cReinstater\u201d. A clearer way is expected for this section.\n\n2.\tI believe that three are several highly relevant works that are not properly cited.\n\nIn Section 3.1, they mention that TimeVQ receives the univariate time series by flattening the sensor channel. Flattening channels for univariate time series is firstly used in Crossformer [1].\n\nIn Section 3.2, they process the input series by removing mean and std and then recover the scale information by MLP, which is same as the usage in Non-stationary Transformer [2].\n\nIt is notable that I am not attempt to owning these designs in TOTEM to previous works, since they can be used for different proposes. However, these methods should be discussed at least. \n\nIn addition to the technical design, TimesNet [3] also focuses on the task-general backbone for time series, which should be discussed and compared.\n\n[1] Crossformer: Transformer Utilizing Cross-Dimension Dependency for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting, ICLR 2023\n\n[2] Non-stationary Transformers: Exploring the Stationarity in Time Series Forecasting, NeurIPS 2022.\n\n[3] TimesNet: Temporal 2D-Variation Modeling for General Time Series Analysis, ICLR 2023\n\n3.\tAbout main experiments.\n\nAs I aforementioned, TimesNet is an important baseline, which is also evaluated on forecasting, classification and imputation tasks. They should compare with it in all three tasks. \n\nBesides, the proposed model performs worse than other models on the Weather, Traffic and Electricity datasets.\n\n4.\tAbout the efficiency comparison.\n\nSince they flatten the sensor channel of the multivariate data, they model efficiency will be extremely poor when it comes to time series with a lot of dimensions, such as Traffic. The efficiency comparison between TOTEM and other baselines is required, such as GPU memory, running time and parameter size.\n\n5.\tAblation study is missing.\n\nAn important ablation is to replace the TimeVQ with one simple linear layer conducted on patch, which can support the motivation in utilizing VQ-VAE for time series encoding.\n\n6.\tThe discussion about the translation and imputation tasks.\n\nI can understand that translation is a challenging task. But imputation is also challenging since it requires the model to handle the missing data. It is also important to discuss the model performance in the missing data scenario.\n\n7.\tI think the title is kind of over-claimed. \n\nActually, TimesNet also adopts larger datasets. You can find them in the anomaly detection task in the TimesNet\u2019s paper (more than 500k series). Thus, I think it is hard to claim \u201cat scale\u201d, since the dataset size is not that large.\n\nBesides, they mentioned \u201cacross domains and tasks\u201d. But only cross domain zero-shot experiments are conducted. For different tasks, they still need to retrain the model and task-specific heads."

                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "This work exhibits several weaknesses in its approach:\n\n1. The method lacks a clear and intuitive motivation. Time-series data are inherently complex and challenging for human understanding, while tokens or word sequences are more easily comprehensible. Thus, the quantization of real-value time-series signals may not yield significant benefits.\n\n2. The algorithm heavily relies on the VQVAE method, with only minor modifications applied to the original algorithm. Consequently, the level of novelty introduced by this work is relatively low.\n\n3. The assertion of a \"universal\" representation appears overstated. While the results for Neuro datasets in forecasting show significant improvements over baselines, the performance on other datasets is relatively subpar, casting doubt on the universality claim. Furthermore, the statement that \"we only train one TimeVQ per dataset\" suggests that the learned representation is dataset-specific, which contradicts the concept of universality.\n\n4. The experimental methodology is not robust. It is unclear whether the method was evaluated with multiple random runs, and the absence of standard deviation values for different experiment settings raises concerns about the reliability of the results.\n\n5. The addition of new datasets seems arbitrary, as it primarily includes human-brain ECoG datasets. The motivation behind selecting these specific domain datasets over others remains unclear.\n\n6. The exploration of domain gaps in the experiments is unsatisfactory. Training on data from one set of human domains and transferring to another, with small domain gaps, lacks persuasiveness. The absence of evaluations in more significant domain gap scenarios raises questions about the method's adaptability to varying data domains.\n\nIn summary, this paper appears to suffer from several key issues. Firstly, it lacks novelty in its methodology, as it heavily builds upon existing techniques with only minor modifications. Secondly, there is room for significant improvement in the experimental design and execution, including the need for more rigorous evaluation metrics and consideration of standard deviations. Finally, the paper is marred by over-claiming statements that may not be fully supported by the results presented. These aspects collectively contribute to a less convincing and impactful research contribution."
