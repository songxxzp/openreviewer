The authors are motivated by the assertion that to ensure adversarial robustness, the data loss should exhibit a low curvature. Drawing inspiration from prior studies that enhanced adversarial robustness through curvature regularization, they bridge this approach with a gradient matching-based dataset condensation algorithm. As a result, they propose a methodology named \"Geometric regUlarization for Adversarial Robust Dataset\" (GUARD). The dataset produced using this methodology demonstrates superior adversarial robustness performance in various settings when compared to traditional techniques."

They also highlight the challenges of adversarial training in dataset condensation, tackling the issue from a curvature perspective.\n- By bridging two methodologies, gradient matching in data condensation and CURE in adversarial robustness, the paper introduces a robust data condensation method named GUARD. This proposed method integrates curvature considerations into the gradient matching process of condensed data via regularization.\n- The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves relatively higher robust accuracy compared to traditional methods.

                    "value": "- Previous methodologies were conducted without considerations related to adversarial robustness. Achieving performance that doesn't significantly surpass these methods might not hold substantial meaning. Notably, the performance against strong attacks does not seem to indicate significant robustness. When proposing a methodology considering adversarial robustness, I believe that the proposed method should exhibit a performance better than random chance (10% for 10-class tasks) when subjected to strong attacks. The setting for strong attacks reflects the benchmark for invisible perturbations in the adversarial robustness research area. Approaches that fail to demonstrate significant performance improvements in this setting are arguably limited.\n- Naturally, training methodologies considering adversarial robustness demand higher computational costs compared to standard training. Given that the proposed method appears to simultaneously utilize both the conventional method (gradient matching) and curvature regularization, it seems to require a relatively high computational cost (please correct me if I'm mistaken). However, the enhanced robustness performance doesn't seem to justify this computational overhead.\n- The proposed method shows a decline in performance on regular data compared to traditional methods. While a trade-off between robustness and accuracy can be expected, the drop in clean accuracy doesn't seem to be adequately compensated by an increase in robust accuracy."

What are the author's thoughts on this? My knowledge in the dataset condensation field is limited; hence, I'm unaware if there have been studies focusing on adversarial robustness in this domain. Considering the methodologies compared in the paper, it appears there might not be. Therefore, it's challenging to judge the appropriateness of the paper's settings. Given that the model has been trained on limited data, I'd like to inquire whether it's suitable to compare the performances of methodologies under a weaker setting (epsilon=2), rather than the conventional adversarial settings employed in the vision domain.\n- Are there any other cases where adding curvature regularization to methods other than gradient matching leads to an improvement (not marginal) in robustness performance?"

Below are our responses to your questions and suggestions:\n\n**The proposed method should exhibit a performance better than random chance.**\n\nWe don\u2019t believe it is fair to hold adversarial defense methods for condensed datasets to such standard. Many of the adversarial defense methods that work well under the real dataset setting do not apply in the condensed dataset setting. This is because one of the fundamental premises of dataset condensation is that no real data will be given to the downstream model at training time, which is important to preserve many of the properties of condensed datasets, including size, training efficiency, and privacy. Without real data, the data distribution that the model learns is already largely different compared to the test images, making it much easier for the adversary to find adversarial examples. Therefore, we don\u2019t think it is realistic to expect the same degree of robustness from condensed datasets and real datasets. \n\nIn addition, one reason for the low level of robustness is the inherent low level of clean accuracy. For example, many adversarial defense methods can retain a robustness of around 50%, on a model that can normally achieve 90% clean accuracy on CIFAR10. However, DC can only achieve 50% clean accuracy on CIFAR10, so it is not surprising that when applied the same level of attack, the robustness accuracy deteriorates severely. \n\nWe are aware of the lack of previous research in this area. This is why in addition to comparison to vanilla dataset condensation methods, in the appendix we also showed a comparison between our results and those obtained from adversarial training, which is recognized as one of the more effective adversarial defense methods for standard datasets. This comparison demonstrates that our method yields superior results.\n\n**The enhanced robustness performance doesn\u2019t seem to justify this computational overhead. Has there been an analysis regarding computational cost?**\n\nAlthough we don\u2019t have a formal analysis of the computational cost, it is very negligible. In fact, although the problem of robust dataset condensation is a tri-level optimization problem, we formulated our method in this exact way to reduce the potential computational cost by embedding the procedure in the bi-level optimization of dataset condensation.\n\nYou can look at our algorithm in the appendix. Our perturbation $z$ is calculated from the gradients from the real images, where the gradient is already calculated in the original DC algorithm. Then, we simply do another forward pass (without a backward pass) with real images plus $z$, and calculate the final regularization through the difference of the losses. This means the overall computational overhead is only a single forward pass per iteration. \n\n**The proposed method shows decline in performance on regular data.**\n\nIn fact, we show improvements to clean accuracy after applying our method in the appendix. (Our base condensation method is DC). While this increase in accuracy may be due to differences in experimental procedures, and is not an intended consequence of GUARD, it does show that there is no clear decrease in clean accuracy.\n\n**Are there performance results under AutoAttack setting with the same epsilon as strong attack?**\n\nUnfortunately we haven\u2019t conducted experiments in that particular setting.\n\n**Are there any other cases where adding curvature regularization to methods other than gradient matching leads to an improvement?**\n\nYes! In our appendix, we presented results where we utilized SRe2L [1], a condensation method that performs better on high resolution datasets, and tested our method on ImageNette where it showed an improvement.\n\n[1] Zeyuan Yin, Eric Xing, and Zhiqiang Shen.

Firstly, looking at the experimental section, I'm not quite sure what the improvement in adversarial robustness at the scale shown in Table 2 indicates, especially when considering the standard deviation. It seems to only weakly suggest that the proposed method may exhibit better consistency in terms of adversarial robustness. I find it difficult to consider this experimental result as strong support for the author's conclusions.\n\nRegarding the method, the author uses Taylor expansion to find the relationship between adversarial samples and the first and second-order information of samples under the model. However, they only briefly mention that \"previous work has shown that regularizing gradients gives a false sense of security about the robustness of neural networks\" and then solely rely on the curvature term as a regularization term -- without further theoretical or experimental justification. I find this unacceptable. Furthermore, the approximation of the Hessian matrix is very rough, and there is no further exploration or explanation regarding the parameter $h$.\n\nOverall, the research direction is indeed valuable, but the current version is too rough and would be difficult to be considered as a top conference paper."

If the adversarial samples are defined as maximizing the loss, then it seems that the inequality should be reversed. However, considering the higher-order terms, I am not entirely sure about the direction of this inequality. Please correct me if I misunderstood.\n\nSecondly, I find the assumption in Proposition 1 regarding the convexity of $l(\\cdot)$ confusing. Why can we make such an assumption?\n\nMoving on to the experimental section, there is a significant decrease in performance on clean samples after applying this method (as shown in the appendix). I am unsure if this contradicts the statement mentioned in the paper that \"in practice, it is important that the condensed data enable the model to perform well both in i.i.d test setting and under adversarial attacks\" (currently, it seems contradictory). Additionally, these experimental results should be presented in the main body of the paper."

DC learns to synthesize a smaller dataset such that models can still have good generalization performance if they are trained on this smaller dataset. The authors provided a negative answer to the hypothesis -- DC can generate datasets that can foster adversarially robust models by discarding non-observable features that often lead to adversarial vulnerability. Finally, the authors proposed a method called GUARD (Geometric regUlarization for Adversarial Robust Dataset) to improve adversarial robustness for DC methods by incorporating curvature regularization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 classification tasks."

The authors proposed to study whether DC methods are adversarially robust. The motivation is very weak. I cannot see any significance in studying this topic. \n\n- Although overturned by the authors, the hypothesis \"adversarial robustness might be inherently induced by the dataset condensation process\" does not make much sense. It is not clear why DC can be linked with the previous work that suggested the adversarial vulnerability of models is often tied to these non-observable features since the authors did not study what type of features are discarded by DC methods. Also, the goal of DC seems to reduce training samples other than discarding non-observable features. The connection between these two types of work seems to be hallucinated without any evidence. \n\n- The novelty of the proposed method is not clear. Curvature Regularization has been considered by (Moosavi-Dezfooli et al. 2019). The technical novelty is limited.\n\n- The experiment is weak. Only conduct on MNIST and CIFAR10.  Only evaluate ConvNet with 3 layers. \n\n- The authors only compare the adversarial robustness performance with several DC methods. The improvements are very marginal. For example, for l-inf attack, the performance of the proposed method is 0.7\u00b10.2, which can not show any improvements. In other words, the proposed method also fails under this attack."

Below, we present our responses to your questions and suggestions:\n\n**DC was a recent technique that has not been recognized by many people.**\n\nDataset condensation has been proven of interest to the community by its popularity and the large body of related works. Our work is extremely relevant in this area, as several papers [1, 2] have discussed the potential application of dataset condensation in trustworthy machine learning (and hence why we study the topic of adversarial robustness).\n\n[1] Zongxiong Chen, Jiahui Geng, Derui Zhu, Herbert Woisetschlaeger, Qing Li, Sonja Schimmler, Ruben Mayer, and Chunming Rong. A Comprehensive Study on Dataset Distillation: Performance, Privacy, Robustness and Fairness. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.03355, 2023.\n\n[2] Jiahui Geng, Zongxiong Chen, Yuandou Wang, Herbert Woisetschlaeger, Qing Li, Sonja Schimmler, Ruben Mayer, Zhiming Zhao, and Chunming Rong. A Survey on Dataset Distillation: Approaches, Applications, and Future Directions. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.01975, 2023.\n\n**The hypothesis does not make much sense**\n\nThe hypothesis is based on the premise that synthesizing a smaller training dataset from a larger one inherently involves discarding some information and features. We believe this selective reduction is a necessary part of the data condensation process.\n\n**The novelty of the proposed method is not clear.** \n\nGUARD is not just a simple combination of the Dataset Condensation with Gradient Matching (DC) and the CURE method. Unlike the CURE regularizer, our method embeds the regularization into the condensed dataset, allowing for no decrease in actual training time efficiency.\n\nThat being said, our work serves as an important foundation for robust dataset condensation and is much more than just the proposed GUARD framework. Not only did we provide a formulation of robust dataset condensation and a comprehensive robustness benchmark of SOTA methods, but we are also the first to theoretically prove that minimizing the adversarial loss of the condensed dataset and minimizing the adversarial loss of the real dataset is only different by a constant factor, which is very useful for future works in this area. \n\n**The Experiment is Weak.**\n\nOur experiments in the main paper focused on MNIST and CIFAR10 because we attached the regularizer to DC, which is notably less effective with high-resolution datasets. However, in the appendix, we extended our experimentation using SRe2L [3], a more suitable condensation method for high-resolution datasets. This allowed us to test our method on ImageNette and present these results for a more comprehensive evaluation\n\n[3] Zeyuan Yin, Eric Xing, and Zhiqiang Shen. Squeeze, Recover and Relabel: Dataset Condensation at ImageNet Scale From A New Perspective. Neurips 2023. \n\n**The improvement is marginal**\n\nWe recognize that our improvement may seem low compared to normal adversarial robustness papers. This is because improving adversarial robustness on condensed datasets is not a trivial task. Many of the adversarial defense methods that work well under the real dataset setting do not apply in the condensed dataset setting. This is because one of the fundamental premises of dataset condensation is that no real data will be given to the downstream model at training time, which is important to preserve many of the properties of condensed datasets, including size, training efficiency, and privacy. Without real data, the data distribution that the model learns is already largely different compared to the test images, making it much easier for the adversary to find adversarial examples. Therefore, we don\u2019t think it is realistic to expect the same degree of robustness from condensed datasets and real datasets. \n\nIn addition, one reason for the low level of robustness is the inherent low level of clean accuracy. For example, many adversarial defense methods can retain a robustness of around 50%, on a model that can normally achieve 90% clean accuracy on CIFAR10. However, DC can only achieve 50% clean accuracy on CIFAR10, so it is not surprising that when applied the same level of attack, the robustness accuracy deteriorates severely. \n\nIn the appendix, we conducted a comparison between our results and those obtained from adversarial training, which is recognized as one of the more effective adversarial defense methods for standard datasets. This comparison demonstrates that our method yields superior results."

The definition of $h$ is missing in Proposition 1. \n3. Why is $\\tilde \\ell(x,v)$ convex in terms of $x$ in the appendix A given that $\\ell(x)$ is convex? It's obvious that $\\tilde\\ell(x,\\cdot)$ is convex but $\\tilde\\ell(\\cdot,v)$ might not be convex. Say $\\ell(x)=-x^3+3x^2$ and hence $\\ell(x)$ is convex in $[0,1]$. The corresponding quadratic approximation $\\tilde\\ell(x,v)$ has second order derivative on $\\frac{\\partial^2\\tilde\\ell(x,v)}{\\partial x^2}=-6x$ is non-positive in $[0,1]$, which implies that it is non-convex in $[0,1].$\n4. I think eq(12) in the appendix A requires $h^{-1}(\\cdot)$ to be a contraction map, why is that true? If it is true, then $\\left\\|h\\left(x^{\\prime}\\right)-\\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim D_c}[h(x)]\\right\\| \\leq \\sigma$ basically implies that the distance between the $x'$ and the mean of training samples with label $c$ is no larger than $\\sigma$.

We agree that it relates to our topic of study, and have included them in our paper.\n\n**Is it $\\phi$ or $\\theta$ in \u201cwhere $\\phi$ is some neural network and D is a distance function in the parameter space\" in page 4?**\n\nYes, thank you for pointing out our type. It is indeed supposed to be $\\theta$.\n\n**Definition of h is missing**\n\nh is a feature extractor, which was defined in the formal proof in our appendix. We have added the definition to the proposition for clarity.\n\n**Why is $\\tilde{l}(x, v)$ convex given that l(x) is convex?**\n\nThe first term, $\\ell(x)$, is convex by assumption. The second term, $\\nabla \\ell(x)^{\\top} v$, is a linear function in $v$ and inherently convex. The third term, $\\frac{1}{2} v^{\\top} H v$, is a quadratic form. Given that $H$m the Hessian of a convex function $\\ell(x)$, is positive semi-definite, the quadratic form is also convex in $v$. As the sum of convex functions retain convexity, the collective convexity of all three terms ensures that $\\tilde{\\ell}(x+v)$ is convex.\n\n**I think eq(12) requires $h^{-1}()$ to be a contraction map**\n\nThe assumption in eq(12) is adopted from a specific dataset condensation method outlined in [1]. This method specifically optimizes the synthetic dataset to minimize the distance between the distribution of the real and synthetic data.\n\n[1] Bo Zhao and Hakan Bilen.

However, eq(8) in Appendix A requires the convexity of $\\tilde \\ell(\\cdot,v)$, which is not generally true. (See the previous counterexample I gave.)\n\n2.
