By properly routing the experts, the model learns to handle various circumstances adaptively. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of TESAM."

There are multiple sets of terminologies describing the same thing without an explicit connection. For example, when categorizing traffic patterns, both \"recurring vs non-recurring\" and \"normal vs abnormal\" (in Conclusion) are used; when describing the three experts, \"temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, spatio-temporal modeling with dynamic graph\" (in Abstract) and \"identity experts, adaptive experts, attention experts\" (in Figure 1). Clarifying these key concepts will make the presentation clearer.\n3. Only the overall metrics for predicting accuracy are reported. It is unclear what recurring and non-recurring patterns that TESTAM captured while other methods miss. Some in-depth experimental analysis (see Q4 for details) will better support the claim of the first contribution."

In the abstract, the authors state that TESTAM can model isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. Can you provide some experimental results and analysis for this claim, e.g. case study?\n\nMinor:\n1. Please add comments to the meaning of results in bold and underlined in Table 1.\n2.

Lack of novelty in terms of spatial and temporal modeling\n> Thank you for your feedback! We would like to emphasize that this paper proposes novel context-aware spatial modeling (i.e., different spatial modeling method selections), which reveals that spatio-temporal modeling with multiple spatial modeling methods could lead to better forecasting results. \n\n> Furthermore, Time-enhanced attention and temporal information embedding are our approach\u2019s novel temporal modeling methods, which enable better information transfer from the input domain to the output domain. As shown in Table 2 in Sec. 4, without time-enhanced attention, TESTAM experiences a performance degradation from 6.40 to 6.64 in terms of MAE with EXPY-TKY. Please see Table 2 in Sec. 4 and check the ablation study results.\n\nW2. Inconsistent usage of terms\n> Thank you for your feedback! We have revised the inconsistent use of terms and clarified them in our manuscript.\n\nW3, Q4. Only the overall metrics are reported, authors should conduct an in-depth experimental analysis.\n> Thank you for your valuable comment! We additionally provide the newly updated and detailed experimental results in Appendix C. Based on the experiment results for roads that have difficult conditions\u2013isolated roads, intersections, or sudden traffic jams caused by events (e.g., accidents)\u2013TESTAM achieves a consistent performance improvement of 4% to 7% compared to other models. We also provide qualitative results in Appendix C with descriptions that showcase how TESTAM improves performance under difficult conditions.\n\nQ1. Why the proposed method is abbreviated as TESTAM?\n> TESTAM is the abbreviation for \u201ctime-enhanced spatio-temporal attention model.\u201d We clarified this in the Introduction.\n\nQ2. What does \"in-situ\" mean in the context of this manuscript?\n> We use the term \u201cin-situ\u201d to better describe the dynamic and context-aware selection of spatial modeling methods.\n\nQ3. Do temporal information embedding and time-enhanced attention affect the performance?\n> We newly updated our ablation study results (i.e., Table 2 in Sec. 4) for TIM and time-enhanced attention. Without time-enhanced attention, the model indicates high-performance degradation from 6.40 to 6.64 in terms of MAE for the EXPY-TKY dataset.\n\nWe also resolved minor issues. Here is the list:\n1. We clarified the meaning of the results in bold and underlined in Table 1. Results in bold indicate the best performance and those underlined indicate the second-best performance\n2. We updated the qualitative analysis and descriptions in Appendix, C.\n3. We revised manuscripts for the equations to be numbered\n4. We provide explicit formula and descriptions for pseudo labels in Appendix A"

I have noticed some efforts of the authors to unify the terminologies.

They first appear in Figure 1 without explanation, and their effects are discussed in Section 4.3. Clarification is needed.\n\nW3. The added experimental results substantially increase the quality of this manuscript. It would be better to report some statistics of the three scenarios (I, H, E) to help readers gain an intuitive understanding. In Appendix C.1, the authors can visualize the selected roads if possible."

There are many typos, and some incorrect writings can seriously mislead the readers:\n   - '...choose spatial modeling methods (i.e., expert) properly; and' on page one.\n   - $f(X^{(t)},\\theta)$ should be replaced by 'g(X^{(t)},\\theta)' on page three.\n   - In the formulas at the bottom of page five, the superscript (k) in $W_{q}^{(k)}$ and $W_{k}^{(k)}$ appears to be meaningless and should be replaced by $W_q$ and $W_k$.\n   - On the fifth page, $\\[\\tau^{(t+1),...,\\tau^{(t+T)}\\]$ should be changed to $\\[\\tau^{(t+1),...,\\tau^{(t+T')}\\]$.\n   - In formula 5 on the sixth page, 'larger than q-th quantile' should be corrected to 'smaller than q-th quantile.'\n   - In the seventh page, the sentence 'excludes the relatively coarse-grained loss function only' should have 'only' removed.\n   - The functions such as 'Concat' and the activation functions 'relu' should be written as upright letters.\n   - Some formulas have equation numbers, while others do not.\n\nW2. The effectiveness of Time-enhanced Attention has not been verified through ablation experiments, and readers cannot determine whether it truly enhances the model's predictive performance.\n\nW3. The distinction between best-route selection and worst routing avoidance is not clear. When introducing best-route selection, the authors mention node-wise routing and node-wise pseudo-label but haven't explained them. Additionally, changing 'smaller than q-th quantile' to 'smaller than (1-q)-th quantile' alone is considered best-route selection, but the reason for this change has not been provided.\n\nW4. Experimental results:\n   - The experimental results are inconsistent. In Table 2, the results for TESTAM in the ablation experiment are for a 30-minute forecast, but they do not match the results in Table 1. Additionally, I noticed that in Table 2, the PEMS-BAY dataset performs better in the 'w/o gating' condition than the complete TESTAM model in Table 1.\n\n   - The magnitude of the performance improvement is minimal. Table 1 shows that many metrics only slightly improve in terms of percentiles, at the cost of three times the computational time and memory for building three expert models.\n\nW5. The title doesn\u2019t well match with this study itself. Actually, this work mostly focuses on traffic forecasting, but the title   suggesting a new general Spatio-Temporal Attention Model with MoE seems much more general and broader."

                        "value": "Thank you for your detailed comments! Those reviews are really helpful to improve our manuscripts. Below are detailed responses to questions and how we improved our manuscripts.\n\nW1. Many typos, incorrect writing, and grammar errors\n> We first revised the manuscript with authors to fix the typos related to mathematical equations and worked with native English speakers to improve our manuscripts.\n\nW2. The effectiveness of time-enhanced attention should be verified through ablation study\n> We newly updated our ablation study results (i.e., Table 2 in Sec. 4) for time-enhanced attention. Without time-enhanced attention, the model indicates high-performance degradation from 6.40 to 6.64 in terms of MAE for the EXPY-TKY dataset.\n\nW3. Need detailed information for the best-route selection loss function\n> We updated the detailed information on the best-route selection in Appendix A. In our paper, we set q = 0.7. In this setting, an error greater than 70% of the error distribution, which is equal to the top 30% MAE, will be the worst route. In this setting (q=0.7), the bottom 30% MAE will be the best route, which means an error smaller than 1 - q-th quantile will be the best route. We revised our manuscripts and added detailed explanations in Appendix A.\n\nW4-1. About experimental results in Table 2\n> Our results are actually consistent. To further clarify this, the results in Table 2 are reported across all forecasting windows. This means that the averages from short-term to long-term forecasting results. We have clarified the missing information in our manuscript. \n\nW4-2. Concerning computational costs\n> TESTAM uses a small number of parameters with fewer layers compared to other models, as a result, the computational costs are not expensive. We report a detailed time complexity analysis in Appendix B. For your information, we briefly summarize the results here. TESTAM requires a similar time as DCRNN in training. In the inference phase, TESTAM shows the second fastest computation (about 7 seconds) with the smallest number of the parameters, which is faster than that of the other models except Graph-WaveNet (about 4 seconds).\n\n\nW4-3. Marginal improvements in Table 1, require a case study and investigation\n> As we described in our manuscripts, we focus on in-situ selection in spatial modeling methods to improve situation awareness of the model. We additionally provide the newly updated and detailed experimental results in Appendix C. Based on the experiment results for roads that have difficult conditions\u2013isolated roads, intersections, or sudden traffic jams caused by events (e.g., accidents)\u2013TESTAM achieves a consistent performance improvement of 4% to 7% compared to other models. We also provide qualitative results in Appendix C with descriptions that showcase how TESTAM improves performance under difficult conditions. \n\nW5. The title isn't well-matched to the manuscripts\n> Thank you! We will add the traffic forecasting in the title in the final version. It will be \"TESTAM: A Time-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Attention Model with Mixture of Experts for Traffic Forecasting\"\n\nQ3. Why do the authors utilize the similarity between input and output as routing probability?\n> Thank you for your feedback. I guess there exists a misunderstanding. In short, the similarity between $z_e$ and $O_i$ is equivalent to that between the output representation of experts and input-conditioned memory units trained to be in the same space as $z_e$. \n\n> In our design, we first make query $Q_i$ by projecting input to the query domain. In this process, the projection learns the input-output mapping, which converts input $X$ (in the input domain) into the $Q$ (in the same domain as final hidden states). Afterward, it queries the memory unit by attention mechanism. Then, the queried memory $O$ is an input-conditioned memory unit that will be trained to be in the same space as the output representations of experts. Therefore, in fact, the similarity between $z_e$ and $O_i$ is equivalent to one between the output representation of experts and the input-conditioned output representation. In this design, the routing probability will be interpreted as the finding of the most feasible solution from experts by using input-conditioned typical output representation."

I wonder if TESTAM is even slower than MegaCRN and/or PM-MemNet to train. \n\nThe discussion of the results have focused on comparisons with GMAN and StemGNN which are from 2020 and are relatively \"old\" methods already. \n\nOverall, the importance of the proposed techniques has not been shown with strong evidence. \n\nMinor presentation issues:\nTypo: \"is noisy sensitive\", \"ahve\", \"Let define\";\nCheck \"where f(X(t), \u03b8)\" below Equation 1;\nGrammar: \"traffic data is noisy and contains many non-stationary, make the best route selection hard.\""

Table 1 shows marginal improvements and only reports the averaged performance without reporting the performances in various circumstances, including recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns.\n> Thank you for your feedback! As we described in our manuscripts, we focus on an in-situ selection of spatial modeling to improve situation awareness of the model. To emphasize the contribution and validate the situation-awareness of TESTAM, we additionally provide the detailed experimental results in Appendix C. Specifically, in the case of isolated roads, intersections, or sudden traffic jams caused by events (e.g., accidents), TESTAM achieves a consistent improvement of 4% to 7% compared to existing models.\n\nW2. Queries for the computational costs analysis\n> TESTAM uses a small number of parameters with fewer layers compared to other models, as a result, the computational costs are not expensive. We report a detailed time complexity analysis with the METR-LA dataset in Appendix B. For your information, we briefly summarize the results here. TESTAM requires a similar time as DCRNN in training. In the inference phase, TESTAM shows the second fastest computation (about 7 seconds) with the smallest number of the parameters, which is faster than that of the other models except Graph-WaveNet (about 4 seconds)."
