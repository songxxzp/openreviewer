In addition, some experiments have been conducted to support the theoretical claims."

I don't follow the notation used in equation (1). if $w_F$ denotes the whole set of weights, what is the meaning of the product between $Y$ and this term (loss is supposed to be a scalar value)? What kind of product is considered in the expression of $l(w)$? The same thing in Lemma 2 for the function $g$,\n\n4 - In the example on page 3, the authors have said that \"without loss of generality, assume hat ...\". Why should the covariance of the projected pruned weights be positive definite (all eigenvalues are strictly positive ?)? This is actually used in the experiment of section 5.2. \n\n5 - I understand this is a theoretical paper, but choosing only CIFAR10/100 datasets, experimenting in a controlled setup like a diagonal covariance matrix, and on the last layer, using only three architectures for a simple classification problem (no other tasks have been considered), and no experiments for other architectures (RNNs, Transformers, etc) is not completely convincing approach.\n\n6 - I am confused with the notion of iteration $t$ in definition 5, and the \"trained sparse network\" in the theorem 2, Lemma 2, etc.:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Typically, pruning is an iterative approach, meaning that when a trained network is pruned, it should be retrained again (or fine-tuned) to \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0get back its original performance, and the process may be repeated if further pruning is required. Is this the case for you? if so, what are the \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0conditions for the retraining/fine-tuning procedure? (i.e., what is the initialization for the pruned weights?

In addition, does the cycle of prune-retrain/fine-tune happen only one time? \n\n7- The experiment section is quite confusing.

We have taken it all into consideration, and implemented changes where possible and appropriate.\n\n**1. The English of this paper needs to be improved significantly.**\n\nThank you for your point,  throughout the paper, we have improved the language and provided further clarifications.\n\n**2. Many statements and definitions are unnecessarily wordy and long, making reading and following the paper difficult.**\n\nThank you for your feedback. We have made revisions throughout the paper.\n\n**3. What is the meaning of $\\mathcal{F}$ \n in the empirical risk minimization?**\n\nThank you for your question. \n$\\mathcal{F}$ represents a set of networks, each characterized by a set of parameters denoted as \n $w_{F}$. The objective of minimizing the loss function is equivalent to finding a network, or more precisely, a set of parameters, that minimizes the value of the formula given specific inputs and labels. In addition, one way to think of loss function in deep neural networks is a correlation between the class label and the last layer of the network. More specifically, training a classifier is defined by minimizing a loss function that decreases with the correlation between the weighted combination of the layers and the class label.\n In our paper, for simplicity, this correlation is defined as an inner product between $Y$ and the last layer features, but it is straightforward to generalize this to more practical loss functions such as logistic or hinge loss. Note that the same definition is used in the following papers to name a few.\n\n Ilyas A, Santurkar S, Tsipras D, Engstrom L, Tran B, Madry A. Adversarial examples are not bugs, they are features.

In the example on page 3, the authors have said that \"without loss of generality, assume hat ...\".**\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback. In the revised version, we have made the sentence more explicit to clarify. In this paper, we exclusively utilize positive definite covariance matrices for the latent spaces, and our proofs are based on this assumption. This assumption is now explicitly stated in the introduction for transparency. Additionally, in the example provided, we assume, without loss of generality, that the two covariance matrices are identical. Given the assumption maintained throughout the paper, we can confirm those covariance matrices are positive definit.\n\n**5. I understand this is a theoretical paper, but choosing only CIFAR10/100 datasets, experimenting in a controlled setup like a diagonal covariance matrix, and on the last layer, using only three architectures for a simple classification problem (no other tasks have been considered), and no experiments for other architectures (RNNs, Transformers, etc) is not completely convincing approach.**\n\nRegarding the setup and the use of non-diagonal covariance matrices, we conducted experiments as detailed in the Appendix, specifically in the \"MULTIVARIATE GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION WITH NON-DIAGONAL COVARIANCE MATRICES\" section. While our primary goal was to establish theoretical explanations through our theorems, we acknowledge the limited inclusion of experiments with networks beyond the three utilized in this study.\n\n**6.I am confused with the notion of iteration $t$\n in definition 5, and the \"trained sparse network\" in the theorem 2**\n\nIn general, the pruning discussed in this paper is characterized as one-shot pruning rather than iterative pruning. This entails initially training the original network to achieve optimality, followed by a one-shot pruning. Subsequently, the pruned network undergoes fine-tuning for a specified number of epochs. In Definition 5, the iteration \n$t$ corresponds to the epoch $t$ during fine-tuning of the pruned network.\n\nAdditionally, when referring to a \"trained sparse network,\" we mean the pruned network that is already fine-tuned.\n \nRegarding your question about  \"initialization for the pruned weights\", if you mean how the network is initilized for the pruning phasse, the relevant details can be found in Section 5.1 (Pruning Phase).  Indeed, the network is initialized with the best parameters derived from training the original model for a specified number of epochs (in this case, 100 epochs).\n\n**7. The experiment section is quite confusing. In particular, the explanation of the plots, and legends are not consistent.**\n\nTo balance between extensive experimental validation of our theoretical analysis and clear explanations of results, we included most of our experiments in the Appendix and avoided repeated explanations in the main paper. However, in the revision, we clarified the plots further."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for sharing your questions and concerns about the paper. Please find our responses below.\n\n**1. Could you provide direct empirical comparisons of the AP2 and AP3 properties against traditional pruning baselines? How do these new methods fare in terms of conventional metrics like accuracy, FLOPs reduction, and memory footprint?**\n\nNote that, the AP2 and AP3 metrics are not presented in this paper as newly proposed pruning approaches. While AP2 may resemble weight magnitude pruning, it is not employed here as a method to prune the network. Instead, these metrics are utilized to elucidate why the accuracy of the network does not significantly decrease when optimal pruning is applied.\n\nIt's noteworthy that, in future research, based on our in-depth analysis in this paper we plan to introduce a novel pruning approach utilizing the AP3 metric. This new approach will be compared with existing techniques to assess its efficacy in network compression.\n\n**2. Have you tested the robustness of the pruned networks using AP2 and AP3 against adversarial attacks? Additionally, how do these pruned networks perform under distribution shifts or in out-of-distribution scenarios?**\n\nThank you for your inquiry. It's important to clarify that AP3 is not designed as a pruning approach but rather serves as an explanatory metric for network pruning in this study. However, in future research, as we introduce a novel pruning approach based on AP3, we will thoroughly investigate its robustness.\n\n**3. You mentioned deviations from expected results based on Lemma 2. Could you delve deeper into the causes of these discrepancies and potentially adjust the theoretical models to account for them?**\n\nTo clarify, as given in Lemma 2 the performance deviation $D$ is bounded by the function $g$ that depends on hyperparameters $\\epsilon$, the maximum eigenvalue of Hessian at optimal point $\\omega^*$, and constant $C$. However, in practice computing the explicit value of g is intractable. It is important to analyze the relationship between the parameters above and performance deviation. We have shown in the experiments such a relationship as how g is an increasing function of $\\epsilon$.\n\n**4. Are there plans to extend the experiments to a broader range of datasets and architectures? This would help in understanding the generalizability of your findings.**\n\nWe'd like to point out that in the Appendix, we have provided an extensive range of experiments including various architectures. In this paper, we intend to provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of our pruning explanations along with evaluating them on common datasets CIFAR 10 and 100 and VGG, ResNet, and AlexNet networks. To our knowledge, we are the first to explain DNN pruning analytically from a novel information theoretical angle.\n\n**5. Could you provide a detailed analysis of the resource efficiency of the proposed methods, especially in terms of training time, inference speed, and energy consumption?**\n\nThank you for the valid point but as mentioned in previous responses, no specific pruning technique is proposed in this paper.\n\n**6. How sensitive are the AP2 and AP3 properties to changes in hyperparameters? An analysis or discussion on this would be beneficial for practitioners aiming to implement these methods.**\n\nThank you for your question. I appreciate the opportunity to provide more details. AP2 involves no hyperparameters; it is simply the norm of the difference of weight vectors. However, AP3, as outlined on page 8 following Figure 3, does have hyperparameters.\n\nTo elaborate further, when estimating the KL divergence between two multivariate T-student distributions using Monte Carlo estimation, we encounter hyperparameters such as the number of groups, the number of samples, and the degree of freedom. Since there is no exact value for the KL divergence of two multivariate T-student distributions, we opted for an iterative approach with 100 iterations.\n\nThroughout this process, we systematically explore different values for each hyperparameter,  selecting those that lead to convergence in the estimation. This hyperparameter tuning is crucial for enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of the AP3 metric in our analyses."

                    "value": "Here I present some questions and observations from the text that I found difficult to understand:\n- Pg. 1 onwards: I find the usage of \"probability space\" and related terms confusing throughout the paper. Here $\\mathcal{Z}$ is introduced as a \"probability space\" but I strongly suspect the authors mean the domain (state space) of the random variable $Z$. Similar for $\\tilde{Z}$.\n- Pg. 1: Neither in the beginning, nor anywhere the paper makes an explicit, mathematical definition of compression. Given the centrality of the notion for the paper, and the various ways in which it can be defined, I find this a very important shortcoming.\n- Pg. 2: What is a \"probabilistic space\"? If the intended meaning is probability space, more care should be taken for using the established terminology. If not, explicit definition is required.\n- Pg. 2: I find it extremely confusing that the authors use the same terminology for the parameter matrix and its vectorized version. This confusion goes beyond this point as well. E.g. although the authors state that they will proceed with the vectorized parameters, Definition 1 clearly refers to parameter matrix.\n- Pg. 2: In (1), why do the authors refer to a weighted combination of models in the model space? As far as I can see this construction never referred to again.\n- Pg. 2: What are the domains of $\\mathbf{X}$ and $Y$? \n- Pg. 2: I think the paper needs to justify that $\\tilde{w}^* = m^* \\odot w^*$, that the ideal compressed parameters are a masked version of the ideal uncompressed parameters. But given no explicit definition of compression/pruning has been presented, this is difficult to do here.\n- Pg. 2 Definition 2: What is $n$? Above the authors used $\\mathbb{R}^{M_{l-1}\\times M_l}$, why use a different notation now?\n- Pg. 2 Definition 2: What is a filter? Above $f^{(l)}$ has been explicitly introduced as a network layer. But in this definition $f^{(l)}$ is called a \"filter\" and the layers are referred to through scalar $l$. I think that for a paper with theoretical aspirations the notations and terminology are too chaotic.\n- Pg. 2: The paper refers to $\\omega^{(l)}$ as both vectors and \"parameter set\"s. What is a parameter set? Why is the naming for this term changing?\n- Pg. 2: \"$\\mathcal{Z}$ and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{Z}}$ are latent spaces that could overlap.\" Should these two spaces not be the same in order for KL divergence to be computable? What are we integrating over in Eq. 2, if not?\n- Pg. 4 Definition 5: Why is the probability space in the first sentence defined? Is it used in any way? Is $\\mathcal{F}$ the event space here, was this notation not reserved for the model space? I strongly suspect that the authors intended mapping is to a space of probability spaces defined on the same measurable space, with the state space being $\\mathcal{Z} = \\tilde{\\mathcal{Z}}$. If this is true, the definition strays far away from this purpose, and the use of terms such as \"probabilistic space\" adds to the confusion.\n- Pg. 5 Theorem 1: The theorem starts with a compressed training scheme. This is not introduced beforehand or afterwards.\n- Pg. 6: How are these models pre-trained?\n- Pg. 8: Given these results, do not the papers' findings boil down to suggesting using Frobenius norm of the original and pruned parmaeters difference for examining compression and performance? If so, is this not a very novel finding, and should be considered in light of previous results such as [1].\n\n[1] Y. Jiang*, B. Neyshabur*, H. Mobahi, D. Krishnan, and S.

The optimal sparse weight is achieved by  $(m^*, \\omega^*):= \\underset{\\omega,m}{\\arg \\min}  \\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{X},Y)\\sim D} \\\\{ Y \\cdot \\ell(\\omega) \\\\}$\".\nThis definition aligns with standard approaches, and we refer to a specific paper as an example.\n\n Blalock, Davis and Gonzalez Ortiz, Jose Javier and Frankle, Jonathan, and Guttag, John, \"What is the State of Neural Network Pruning?,\" Proceedings of Machine Learning and Systems, 2020 (2), 129--146. \n\n**Pg. 2: What is a probabilistic space?**\n By probabilistic space, we meant the same as probability space and we fixed this in the revised version.\n\n**Pg. 2: I find it confusing**\n\nWe maintain consistent notation for both weight matrices and vectors for simplicity, explicitly noting in the Notations section that weight tensors can be viewed as high-dimensional vectors. We have made adjustments in the introduction for enhanced clarity and acknowledge and correct the noted typo in Definition 1.\n\n**Pg. 2: In (1)**\n\nIndeed, it is a common definition of loss function. \n Moreover, we defined $\\ell(\\omega)$ as the weighted combination of the networks and we used this definition in our proofs.\nFor reference, Please see the loss function definitions in equations 3 and 2 in the following papers, respectively.\n\n1.

Craig J, Andle J, Nowak TS, Sekeh SY. A Theoretical Perspective on Subnetwork Contributions to Adversarial Robustness. arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.03803, 2023.\n\n**Pg. 2: What are the domains**\nThe input $\\mathbf{X}\\in \\mathcal{X}$ and target $Y\\in \\mathcal{Y}$ have realization space $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$, respectively with joint distribution $D$. We have restated this in the revision to clarify this.\n\n**Pg. 2: I think**\n\nAs previously mentioned, employing  ${\\widetilde{\\omega}}^*=m^*\\odot \\omega^*$ serves as one approach to define pruning.\n\n**Pg. 2 Definition 2: What is $n$?**\n\nYou are correct. This was a typo and is fixed in the revision.\n\n**Pg. 2 Definition 2: What is a filter?**\n\nIn general, the notation $f^{(l)}$ (referring to the l-th layer of the network) denotes the filters of that particular layer. We have clarified this in the revised paper.\n\n**Pg. 2: The paper**\n\nThe term \"parameter set\" refers to the parameters associated with a distribution. The name of the term $\\omega^{(l)}$ remains unchanged but now serves as a parameter of the distribution. The revised sentence in the updated version aims to provide clarity.\n\n**Pg. 2: $\\mathcal{Z}$ and $\\mathcal{\\widetilde{Z}}$**\n\nTo have a compatible kl divergence between two distributions, they should have the same domain. So either two probability spaces should have some common elements or be aligned. Although, the distributions can be different or have different parameters. The integration is on the same domain of distributions.\n\n**Pg. 4**\n\nThank you for pointing that out. We acknowledge the error, and it has been appropriately addressed in the revised version. \n\n**Pg. 5**\n\nThank you for the feedback. We have rephrased the expression to convey the concept in an alternative manner.\n\n**Pg. 6**\n\nAs indicated in the \"EXPERIMENTS\" section, the models utilized in our study have been pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset. We employed pre-trained models available in the PyTorch framework.\n\n**Pg. 8**\n\nOur paper primarily offers a theoretical explanation of deep neural network pruning. Our objective is not to advocate for a specific pruning approach or demonstrate the superiority of our method over others. Rather, we provide an explanation of the pruning and performance relationship using the Frobenius norm. It's important to note that our experiments serve as evidence supporting our theorems, illustrating why optimal pruning leads to nearly identical accuracy. However, in future works, we plan to propose a novel pruning approach that leverages the AP3 metric and our studies in this paper. This involves fine-tuning hyperparameters and investigating various non-Gaussian distributions to achieve improved accuracy for the pruned network, compared to utilizing the Frobenius norm."
