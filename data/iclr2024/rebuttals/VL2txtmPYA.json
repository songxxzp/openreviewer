In other words, there is no longer a notion of layers. The authors propose a method to dynamically adjust which nodes are connected based on the alignment of their output. The resulting architecture, called free nets, is evaluated through experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST and  Extended MNIST."

Such architecture can heavily reduce the workload needed to design a good architecture for a new task.\n\nThe additional capabilities of the architecture is intuitive but the paper also shows this more rigorously by providing a class of functions that can be represented by freenets and not by fully connected networks. \n\nThe paper is relatively easy to follow."

                    "value": "1. The process of  repeatedly alternating between fine-tuning and pruning phases is widely used for reducing the size of neural networks. There are also several methods (e.g. [1]) that recover pruned weights. As such, this work is basically proposing a new dynamic pruning method based on the firing activity of neurons. A comparison with some of state of the art pruning methods is therefore essential and similarly these methods should be included in the literature review.\n\n2. One of the main obstacles that I can observe is that the paper does not clarify how this model can be adapted to larger scales. In particular there are at least two challenges: a) there is a need for an initial FC layer which maps the input features to freenet neurons. This layer is extremely big for larger number of neurons as the output of this layer has dimension equal to the total number of neurons in the network. b) The freenet starts with all weights connected. Therefore, the total number of weights is much larger than a MLP with multi layers but same number of neurons. This incurs both memory and computation cost especially since this model has to first be trained until convergence (as the first step of free-evolve). Adding neurons increase the cost quadratically instead of linearly in the MLP case.\n\n3. The evaluation is performed on small scale datasets. Such experiments are not at all convincing for a new architecture, especially since as the paper also mentions, it is quite easy to get a high accuracy on such datasets, making it hard to distinguish shortcomings of a method. Indeed the effect of free-evolve is not demonstrated. No confidence interval is also reported.\n\n4. The rules for pruning the weight seem arbitrary. While a rationale is provided for why neurons that do not fire together get disconnected, the same rationale (passing info directly to deeper neurons) could be applied to neurons that fire together to justify disconnecting them. Similarly if neuron a provides a signal to neuron b that prevents it from firing (which could possibly require a non-linear activation to properly work) it is not clear why such connection should be removed.\n\n\n[1] Lin, Tao, Sebastian U.

There has been numerous research on the pruning and Hebbian learning topic starting from 1980s and this submission does not properly discuss its relationship to related papers. For example, see the paper \"Sparsity in Deep Learning: Pruning and growth for efficient inference and training in neural networks\" that has some good references to that. Contributions 2-4 are not convincing, because this submission only compares to a fully connected model and does not compare to other NAS/pruning baselines. There are previous papers like \"Graph Structure of Neural Networks\" that also considered the connectivity between neurons for NAS/pruning and this submission could discuss it as well.\n\nExperiments are performed on very small scale tasks and the gains over the baseline in the range 0.5-1%. The standard deviation of the results is missing making the comparison harder.\n\nThe paper is not clear sometimes and the overall presentation quality requires further polishing (typos, figures partially cut out, etc.)."

FreeNets are layer-free, making them different from traditional feedforward neural networks. The NCG is initialized as an acyclic, uni-directed graph with dense topological ordering. Then, it alternatively optimizes two architectural designs: the edge sets and their weights. While the weights are updated through backpropagation, the edge sets are pruned and augmented in a data-informed algorithm inspired by learning theories from neuroscience. The authors provide theoretical justification for the expressive power of FreeNets, and evaluate FreeNets empirically on image classification datasets against fully-connected neural networks, showing improvements particularly on more challenging datasets."

FreeEvolve is a significant technical contribution of the paper. However, the main improvement seems to come from the initialization from NCG that breaks the layer constraint, but not the evolutionary part. In addition, It may be worthwhile to investigate why a lot more edges are pruned (with a scale of 60 or 600) compared to the number of edges (with a scale of 4 or 20) that are augmented, as shown in Figure 6. \n\n**[W2]** The baselines used for evaluation are only fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs). Although the experiments cover a good range of evaluation, they can significantly enhance the contribution of FreeNets if stronger baselines are also used. For example, neural networks with random residual connection, a randomly initialized NCG with consistent neural topology constraint imposed, or other evolutionary strategies for neural architectural search. Furthermore, while FCNNs match the number of neurons with FreeNets for fair comparison, alternative baselines can also match the number of edges of the produced graph of FreeEvolve.  \n\n**[W3]** The computation cost of training FreeNets and FreeEvolve is not adequately discussed in the paper. Each training step of FreeNets+FreeEvolve requires a few iterations of (i) training the weights and (ii) then pruning or augmenting, until convergence. The algorithm can incur very high computational costs compared to training FCNNs, which only requires one iteration of step (i). In the paper, it is unknown how many iterations are required until convergence for Algorithm 1. It would be better to discuss the training cost theoretically and empirically. \n\n\n\n**[Minors]**\n\n**[M1]** Some labeling of figures is mismatched.
