Perhaps evaluation on fully supervised retrieval would be more informative.\n\n2. It is interesting to study variance in retrieval, but Contriever is not especially competitive compared to more recent dense retrievers.\n\n3. I am not sure the reference numbers for contriever are correct. I checked the contriever paper and saw ndcg@10 is 75.8 instead of 68 for Fever, and is 67.7 instead of 65 for scifact. More generally, the claim that some Contriever random seeds outperform some \"supervised\" models remains confusing since those models are not supervised directly on BEIR and are often outperformed by unsupervised models like BM25. Although more modern models will likely outperform both Contriever and BM25, such as GTR. Contriever paper, https://openreview.net/pdf?id=jKN1pXi7b0\n\n4. The plots are very hard to read with blurry and small text.\n\n5. Perhaps this is the first paper to apply probing to dense retrievers, but there are many papers that analyze gender bias of neural retrieval. These should probably be addressed. See Rekabasz and Schedl: Do Neural Ranking Models Intensify Gender Bias?"

                    "value": "Q1: After a quick search, it appears there are datasets specifically designed to measure gender bias for information retrieval. Did you consider using these datasets? How would they compare to your approach?\n\nQ2: Is gender / topic bias only a concern for dense retrieval? What about sparse retrieval?\n\nQ3: It does seem strange how Contriever seems to converge always to the same accuracy. Could this be due to some peculiar property of the Contriever training? Is it worth training not only on a different shuffle of the data, but perhaps removing some of the data too?\n\nQ4: There should probably be additional clarification for \"exceed the difference in per- formance from adding supervision (over unsupervised learning only)\", since models evaluated on BEIR on never trained directly on BEIR. I assume the supervision is from some other retrieval data such as MSMarco.\n\nQ5: Have you considered causes for variance in some of these datasets? For example, TREC COVID is very small (only 50 queries). HotpotQA is much larger but has one of the stranger evaluation protocols for BEIR, since the original HotpotQA relevance would typically require documents to be retrieved together and BEIR abandoned this.\n\nQ6: Did you consider that data shuffling for Contriever training may play a bigger role than the MultiBERT seed?\n\nQ7: \"The corpus could have lower quality or less informative articles about female entities, queries about women could be structurally harder in some way.\" It could be helpful to clarify this with some examples.\n\nQ8: Why did you choose contriever instead of modern alternatives? I realize that MultiBERTs allow for diversified checkpoints, but it may greatly limit our understanding when applied to retrieval. Are none of the modern retrievers compatible with BERT? Is there some option to provide multiple checkpoints for a modern retriever, perhaps through data shuffling or re-initializing some layers? Or perhaps a different retrieval approach focused on re-ranking the output of BM25 (this is only a rough idea, and I am not confident it is sufficient)?\n\nPresentation Notes\n\n* Figure 1 is hard to read. Perhaps remove background grid and make the reference line more prominent? Why are some plots missing the reference---should indicate if outlier is better or worse? Also the axis is so small... It could be better to include a subset here and put the rest in the appendix.\n\n* typo: there is a large range of benchmark performance across seeds [with for] identical contrastive losses"

                        "value": "Thank you very much for the detailed feedback! \n\nWe appreciate the recognition of the strengths of the work, and the potential value to the community of a detailed analysis of dense retrievers, as well as the resources we intend to release, and the specific analysis of gender bias. \n\nWe hope we can clear up some of your questions below, and show that the choices we made were intentional and well-motivated. We also have some experiments we'd done already that should address some of your concerns, which we detail below.\n\nOverall comments:\n\n1) We do use the correct reference numbers for contriever: the ndcg@10 performance numbers you reference are for contriever fine-tuned on MSMARCO, not for contriever fully unsupervised. The numbers we report are for the latter, as that is the accurate comparison to our work. Both of these numbers (unsupervised and supervised) are in a table in the active repo:https://github.com/facebookresearch/contriever#beir; we confirmed their accuracy by contacting the original contriever paper authors.\n\n2) Data shuffling vs. random weight initialisation. We agree this is interesting! We have done those experiments on the effect of data shuffle, but hadn\u2019t initially included them due to space constraints. To summarise: for that experiment, we took the best, worst, and average seed initialisation and ran them each with 5 different shuffles. We graphed the spread overall, and by dataset, and found that the shuffle did have a significant effect, though less than random seed initialisation. Two notable things from this experiment are: a) the best, middle, and worst seed initialisations mostly stayed in the same order b) the range under data shuffle differed as a property of the random seed: where the worst performing seed had a very large range but the best performing had a very small range. Based on your feedback we will add them to strengthen the findings. Note that in addition to this finding, the MultiBerts paper did extensive experiments on the influence of pretraining seed vs. other factors for the MultiBert models [see Appendix D in MultiBerts](https://openreview.net/forum?id=K0E_F0gFDgA) and found that pretraining seed mattered most, so this is well supported.\n\n3) Other gender bias work: [Rekabsaz and Schedl (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00372.pdf) define bias as the genderedness of retrieved documents based on lexical terms, making the implicit normative statement that lack of bias means equal representation of male and female documents in non-gendered queries: essentially an independence assertion (as defined by [Barocas, Hardt, and Narayan](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html)). Variants of this approach are taken by the follow on work surveying gender bias metrics [Klasnja et al (2022)](https://fairmlbook.org/classification.html). This is quite different to our approach, which looks at performance disparity between queries that require male and female gender information to answer. Our approach has more immediate practical utility for a real world retriever, and also ties in to the work on information theory by restricting to queries that require gender information. The aforementioned works release subsets of MSMARCO, which we did examine and use in initial tests early in this work, but decided that they were unsuitable because of the very different metrics and approaches. We agree with you that the paper would be stronger if we add this context, so we will include it in the final version!\n\n4) Supervised vs. unsupervised retrieval: we had two motivations in using unsupervised retrieval. First. unsupervised retrievers are in wide usage and thus examining them is extremely societally relevant. Second, unsupervised retrieval has cleaner experimental conditions. Supervision adds an additional experimental variable: the fine tuning dataset and its data shuffle, which is unwieldy and costly in an already extremely compute intensive investigation (necessarily so to get many random seeds). Supervision also muddies the analysis: if we\u2019re looking at generalisation capabilities from the objective to the retrieval dataset (which we are) then if we fine-tune we have to have some way of measuring similarity of the dataset we fine tune on to the dataset we test on, and methods for that aren\u2019t very well established. In practice, when you know the domain, you fine tune, but you don\u2019t always have that luxury (which is why unsupervised retrievers are so common). And even when people fine tune, they often contrastively train first, so these results are of value to the whole community and can provide a strong base for further research into the fine tuning domain."

Focusing on two types of information \u2013 topic and gender, the paper observes 1) the contrastive learning increases the extractability of both topic and gender, 2) but the extractability is poorly correlated with the IR benchmark performance, and 3) the allocational gender bias is observed, but the bias is not reduced after removing the relevant gender information (using the null space projection). Overall, this work presents a series of interesting observation on information bias entailed from the dense retrieval representation."

                        "value": "Thank you for recognising the novelty of our contributions and the value to the community of our analysis.\n\nWe believe some of the perceived weaknesses to potentially be confusion about the goals of our paper (though the summary was accurate), so we hope the below clarifies!\n\n1) Extractability is the only metric for this probing method because the metric *is* a property of the method: MDL probing gives you the metric of extractability. Probing methods tend to use either accuracy or extractability, and extractability has been quite strongly shown to be much more reliable than accuracy (see Voita and Titov 2020, who developed MDL probes, for an analysis, as well as Hewitt and Liang 2019 on probe design). Thus there is no utility to using accuracy. Extractability is also the only metric that has been shown to be related to generalisation (Lovering et al 2021) and to fairness (Orgad et al 2022). So the one metric is sufficient to make our point. The important things to vary for probing are the *dataset* used; this ensures it is not an accidental property of the dataset. For this reason we used both BiasinBios and Wikipedia (in 9 different random splits) to verify our findings.\n\n2) We focused on only topic and gender because that was what we could find available dataset labels for, for things that were likely to matter for retrieval. We\u2019re more than happy to extend this work to additional labels if more suitable datasets are made. We\u2019ve also enabled future work to do this, as we are releasing all the models and the code upon publication. The compute and time intensive parts of this work are the model training and the experimental code: running probing on a dataset can be done with one of our shell scripts and easily reported to wandb automatically. We will add a note to this effect to suggest the future work. \n\n3) The focus of the paper is explicitly scoped to be analysis, so the goal is not to improve performance. There are however actionable takeaways from our findings! We included them in the conclusion, but we will edit it to make sure they are highlighted more clearly. They are: 1) train over many random seeds *before* doing other additional work to improve performance, as this is a strong source of variability 2) the shape of the vector space is an early indicator of how good the contriever will be and 3) gender bias in retrieval needs to be corrected by looking at the corpus and the queries, not just the representations. These are all very actionable and will improve both performance and bias. \n\nQuestions:\n\nQ1: The probing model is exactly as designed in Voita and Titov (2020): https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.14.pdf. \nThere is also an excellent blog post on the topic (Voita usually does blog posts): https://lena-voita.github.io/posts/mdl_probes.html. \nTo summarise here, an MDL probe measures online codelength, which quantifies the compressibility of the data. To do that, the data is split into many small sections (1\u2026N) and a classifier is trained to predict labels Y from representations X. Then the classifier is trained again on section 1 + section 2, etc to N. If Y is very extractable from X, it will also be very compressible, and each additional split will not be very hard to transmit because the regularity will have been learnt with little data. If Y is not extractable from X (as in random embeddings for instance) then there will be no compression at all and the effort to transmit will equal the amount of data. The benefit of this method is that it is not sensitive to the parameters of the classifier (which using accuracy is, you can just overparameterise the classifier and memorise noise).\n\nQ2: Yes we do that experiment! Please see Figure 3, where a) and b) are all queries and c) is only gendered queries, as you suggest (and d is control). We also look at gendered vs. non gendered queries in Figure 4. \n\nQ3: The motivation for contrastive learning is to leverage large amounts of unstructured data to learn good representations for retrieval: supervised retrieval datasets are extremely expensive to make (annotators have to select the relevant documents from a corpus of potentially millions of documents) so it is extremely common to take a contrastive approach instead. This is what contriever does. There are many tricks to this process, which are described in detail in the contriever paper: https://openreview.net/forum?id=jKN1pXi7b0. For our purposes, the important thing is that it optimises a contrastive loss, rather than an MLM objective, which should encourage different properties in representations. That difference is part of what we are analysing, and that analysis is part of our contribution."

The paper presents results showing: 1) contriever models see a large variation in performance based on random seed 2) while gender and topic are more extractable from contriver representations than BERT, the ratio of the two is more extractable from BERT. 3) Extractability of gender and topic dont correlate with performance on the retrieval benchmarks."

                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "- I would highly encourage referring to \"topic\" in the paper as \"occupation\" - this is much clearer and seems much more true to the data used for analysis (even the original paper seems to refer to this as occupation: https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09451). The current presentation also makes it seem like the papers scope is much larger than it actually is. Else, please rationalize the scope and the framing of the analysis in greater detail.\n- Several claims in the paper (\"This highlights the gap between ... a limitation of the benchmark\", \"lack of correlation between extractability and performance points to a mismatch between the self-supervised contrastive training objective ...\") seem to imply that there is a problem with the BEIR benchmark tasks or the training objective for contriver because while the training improves extractability of gender and occupation it does not correlate with the benchmark performance. This is not a reasonable inference - an alternative is that the two attributes examined are insufficient for explaining the underlying signals captured by the benchmark tasks and for studying the influence of training. For example training may be improving the extractability of several other attributes not examined in this paper which may better explain benchmark performance. Please soften these claims and discuss the limitations of the attributes examined in this paper (which would of course not be a slight on this work).\n- Table 1 and Figure 1: Thank you for this analysis, this is interesting. While I understand that the analysis is somewhat tangential to the point of the paper, I would recommend some changes to strengthen this analysis: 1) It seems a bit misleading to report the max-min difference for various seeds as a measure of variance based on the seed. Please also report the standard deviation in performance across seeds - this is more common for reporting this kind of variance: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07778. 2) Please report similar statistics for other metrics like Recall@100. It may be the case that the large gaps in performance are a result of the metric choice (eg exponential gain in computation of NDCG) and the presence of unjudged documents in retrieval datasets. Deeper rank metrics will alleviate the latter issue. It would also be illustrative to understand the Recall since dense retrieval systems are usually used for a high recall first stage retrieval. 3) A few of the datasets used in the BEIR benchmark are quite small (~50 queries). Please consider computing statistical significances for the max-min differences. The differences are unlikely to be significant for all the datasets. 4) It is unclear why the seeds influence performance so much - please consider discussing this in greater detail - do the representations change massively due to random seeds? Do the score distributions for positive vs negative change across seeds? (similar to: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/menon22a.html) etc.\n- Please add a main number/caption for all figures and label the axis of plots aptly - they are missing in many places.\n- It's unclear what the procedure for measuring extractability of the gender:topic ratio is - please clarify this better.\n- Please consider citing: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3234944.3234959"

                        "value": "Thank you very much for the extremely thoughtful review! We appreciate your interest in the paper and your detailed notes on it very much. \n\nWe also appreciate your recognition of the novelty and utility to future work in this area, and your interest in our findings on random seed variability.\n \nWe\u2019ve made most of the revisions you suggest, and detailed some experiments that we already have that address a few of your concerns. We discuss everything below. \n\nOverall comments:\n\nWe apologise for the figures being sometimes subpar in labelling and resolution, we made a couple of mistakes using pngs instead of pdfs, and we see the missing labels also. All of these are trivially fixable to improve presentation, and we will do so for the final. We\u2019ll also do a few more editing passes for language and clarity.\n\nOn correlation experiments: the motivation for looking at the correlation was twofold: first, since contriever training so strongly increased extractability, there was an interesting question as to fit between the proxy task in contriever training and the retrieval benchmark: one might reasonably expect, if the proxy task increases it, it to also be important for performance (or at least correlated with, due to some shared underlying factor), but that was an unknown. Second, it came up as a desired addition when we sent a very early draft for feedback to some authors of relevant work. So we added it at that stage, which is perhaps why it doesn\u2019t seem to fit perfectly. We do still find it to be a valuable finding (and were asked for it) so we\u2019ll do a few more drafts to make sure that it\u2019s less distracting, and reorganise to focus on it a little bit less.\n\nQuestions/Suggestions:\n\nQ1: Very fair, we will change it, you\u2019re right that it\u2019s overscoped. It is an artefact of when we had broader experiments on some of the other gender datasets (which included other topic-like metadata) which we then found to be too low quality and had to remove (footnote 3 describes the removal).\n\nQ2: Also a very good suggestion, we will clarify and soften those claims, and discuss those limitations, we agree with your revision fully.\n\nQ3: Regarding Figure 1: \n\n1) We visualised variability via histograms of performance for comparability to the MultiBerts paper, since that is what they used. For the final, we\u2019ll also add standard deviation for comparability to other work in this domain (like in that reference, which is excellent), thank you for the suggestion. \n\n2) Very good point: we did analyse a variety of metrics in our experiments, and it doesn\u2019t change the results: we looked at whether Hole@ metrics seemed to be at play and weren\u2019t able to find anything there, and Recall@100 tracked largely the same as NDCG@10 or 100, including the best and worst seeds (though there is a little bit of shuffling around with the seeds in the middle). In the final, we\u2019ll include our graphs and stats for Recall@100 for all experiments. Your point about frequent usage as a high recall first filter is a good one.\n\n3) We will include stat sig for all datasets in the final: since we saw the variance in all datasets (even the very large ones), we knew it not to be a property of size, but it\u2019s still a good addition and we will add it.\n\n4) Our analysis of the vector spaces of seed 13 (Appendix D) did illuminate some other differences in other random seeds, but predominantly the weakness of seed 10. There weren\u2019t other major differences in anisotropy or vector space volume across other models. Are the similarity measures you\u2019re thinking of something like Linear-CKA? We agree that would be interesting and can add for the final. We had not considered doing the approach of looking at the positive vs. negative distributions, thank you for that idea, it\u2019s very cool. That may be a bit harder to get before the final, but we\u2019ll look into it! And certainly suggest it as follow on work if we can\u2019t, since we\u2019re realising everything.\n\nQ4: We will improve all the figures, thank you! (see overall comment also).\n\nQ5: We will clarify the ratio of gender:topic extractability procedure in the text, our wording was just a bit unclear. This is the ratio of extractability of gender to extractability of topic (not a separate thing measured). We do this since it isn\u2019t only the absolute number that matters for model shortcutting, but also the relative extractability of various information that a model could use. So Figure 2c actually contains the information of 2a and 2b, just displayed differently so that the change in the ratio can be seen. We\u2019ll make this clearer.\n\nQ6:  Thank you, we will cite that paper!"
