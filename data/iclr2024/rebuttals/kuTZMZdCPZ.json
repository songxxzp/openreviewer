In the following, we address all the comments individually for clarity and completeness.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 1: The 4th line of Page 6, \u201cwe uniformly distributing\u201d should be \u201cwe uniformly distribute\u201d.\n\nResponse: Thank you for pointing it out. Fixed.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 2: How do the authors determine the sparse setting (Page 7) for those two datasets? The sparsity ratios for those two datasets are quite different. Also, can the authors provide an estimate or convergence analysis of the smallest number of sensors needed for reconstruction?\n\nResponse: We have conducted additional analysis to determine the minimum number of sensors required for effective reconstruction. Specifically, for each dataset, we employed proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and sorted the computed eigenvalues in descending order. The cumulative energy was calculated, and for the simulation-based data, approximately 750 POD modes are needed to reconstruct $90\\%$ of the total kinetic energy. Note this calculation is based on the snapshot POD method [1, 2]. Using this information, we defined an interval $[0.1\\%, 1\\%]$ and conducted a grid search to estimate the minimal sampling rate. Our findings, both quantitative and qualitative, indicate that $1\\%$ is the closest approximation to the minimum sampling rate for the simulation data. Below is the MSE comparison between MMGN and POD reconstruction, with detailed results and descriptions included in the revised paper.\n\n| Sampling rate | POD | MMGN |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | \n|  $0.1 \\%$ | $0.40475$ | $0.01672$ |\n|  $0.3 \\%$ | $0.14760$ | $0.01312$ |\n|  $0.5 \\%$ | $0.07922$ | $0.01199$ |\n|  $0.7 \\%$ | $0.04830$ | $0.00972$ |\n|  $0.9 \\%$ | $0.03106$ | $0.00796$ |\n\n\n[1] Taira, K., Brunton, S.L., Dawson, S.T., Rowley, C.W., Colonius, T., McKeon, B.J., Schmidt, O.T., Gordeyev, S., Theofilis, V. and Ukeiley, L.S., 2017.

We plan to release the implementations as open source, enabling readers to reproduce the presented results and apply the model to datasets of their research interest.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 4: What are the spatial resolutions for the datasets used in this paper?\n\nResponse: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. For the simulation-based data, it's 1024 (time) $\\times$ 192 (latitude) $\\times$ 288 (longitude); and for the satellite-based data, it's 360 (time) $\\times$ 901 (latitude) $\\times$ 1001 (longitude).

In the data preprocessing step, we intentionally remove the temporal mean and seasonal cycle as they are straightforward to predict. This clarification has been included in the revised paper."

First, mathematical notation is ambiguous and does not seem to follow standard mathematical principles, which creates confusion (Examples are in Questions section). Furthermore, background and description seems to be more like a list of different things and without clear connection. To make presentation more clear, authors could perhaps try to express their method with less mathematically rigours notations, but explaining their method with words (e.g. by providing example) \n\nAs mentioned above, numerical results looks good when compared to other INR methods. However, I would like to see also comparison to other non-INR based methods such as GP (if applicable) or methods that are currently used in meteorology and climate studies."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "Questions and comments:\n\n- Problem setup: They assume that the system is governed by a PDE (1). I don't see any reason why this assumption is made, or is that assumption used somewhere?\n\n- Section 2.1, \"Objective\" (and through the paper): They use notation $\\mathcal U_k=(u(t_k,x)|\\mathcal X_k)_{x\\in X_k}$ . What this \"$|\\mathcal X_k$\" stands in the set? $|$ usually is used for conditioning but I cannot see such a thing here. I would rather remove this extra part here to avoid confusion (I use '(' and ')' instead of curly brackets as this form does not seem to render those (and actually, strictly speaking, '(' and ')' would be preferred if order of measurements have meaning $\\mathcal U_k$))\n\n- The section 2.1 does not talk about noise or randomness and formulations in this section would indicate that $u(t,x)$ is deterministic. However, later sections seems to talk about noise and assume that $u$ is includes noise or is random (e.g. Eq (5) which does not have meaning if $u$ is deterministic). This is contradicting. I would suggest authors that authors would use separate notations for a noiseless quantity $u$ and the measurements, e.g., say something like $y_k$ is a vector of measurements or $u(t_k,x)$ plus noise. \n\n- Section 2.3, \"Neural pinpointing\". They mention that learning-based methods can be computationally demanding. But there are two sides in this: train time computationally complexity and run time/inference computational complexity. GANs have high training complexity but inference may not be soo much, and perhaps even less as the proposed INR depending on the architectures. \n\n- Section 2.4, \"$\\alpha=g(x)\\circ \\eta(t)$. The standard meaning for $\\circ$ is composition of functions, i.e. $(f\\circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$. Here this probable is not the case as I cannot see how you would compose $g$ and $\\eta$ in this case. Of course, authors can define their own notations, but then they should say that how they use the notation. If $\\circ$ is meant to be the multiplication, I would just remove $\\circ$. \n\n- Section 2.4, $\\eta(t_k):\\mathcal U_k=(u(t_k,x)|\\mathcal X_k)_{x\\in \\mathcal X_k}\\mapsto z_k$. Not sure what this is meant to mean. $\\eta$ is a function which maps $t$ to a function which is a mapping between the values of $u$ to $z_k$? \n\n- Section 3 seems to be a list of different things and it not clear to me that how the things are connected. For example, how you use auto-decoder? You have (auto-)decoder as encoder? How Gabor filters are used? Are these somehow connected to $g$ and $\\eta$ earlier? Multiplicative filter network is decoder?"

We have carefully considered your feedback and made substantial revisions to enhance the clarity and coherence of our work. We have simplified the mathematical notations, providing more intuitive explanations and examples to facilitate better understanding. A simple walkthrough is provided below.\n\n**Problem** Our objective is to accurately reconstruct a spatiotemporal continuous physical field, denoted as $\\boldsymbol{u}$, representing quantities such as temperature, velocity, or displacement. This field, $\\boldsymbol{u}$, is inherently a function of both spatial coordinates ($\\boldsymbol{x}$) and time ($t$).\n\n**Prior approaches**  Traditional implicit neural networks (INRs) incorporate the time index ($t$) along with spatial coordinates. For instance, in 2D data, the network features three input nodes for the $x$-coordinate, $y$-coordinate, and time $t$, where the time index ($t$) is employed to direct the model to a particular time instance.\n\n**Our approach** Motivated by the desire for a more context-aware indexing mechanism, we posed the question: Can the indexing process be improved? We propose utilizing measurements observed $u_t^{(1)}, u_t^{(2)}, \\dots$ at time t for implicit model guidance, rather than relying on $t$ for explicit pointing. More precisely, our approach involves constructing an encoder $E_\\varphi(\\cdot)$ to transform the observed measurements $u_t^{(1)}, u_t^{(2)}, \\dots$ into a latent code ($\\boldsymbol{z}_t$). Subsequently, we employ a decoder $D_\\phi(\\cdot)$ that utilizes both the encoded information ($\\boldsymbol{z}_t$) and spatial coordinates ($\\boldsymbol{x}$) to reconstruct the underlying physical field. Below are detailed explanations of the model components we designed and the rationale behind each choice.\n\n- **Encoder**: The *auto-decoder* is chosen as the backbone for the encoder due to its ability to accommodate free-formed observations, considering that the number and positions of available observations vary over time.\n- **Gabor filter**: INRs often encounter challenges in learning high-frequency functions, a phenomenon known as \"spectral bias.\" To mitigate this issue, we employ the Gabor filter to transform spatial coordinates ($\\boldsymbol{x}$) before the decoding process.\n- **Decoder**: The decoder incorporates a multiplicative filter network (MFN) as its backbone network. This choice is motivated by the recursive mechanisms embedded in MFN, enabling improved fusion of spatial coordinates ($\\boldsymbol{x}$) and latent codes ($\\boldsymbol{z}$).\n\n**Results** We conducted comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model.\n\nIn response to your feedback, we have extensively revised our paper, ensuring that the updated manuscript is more accessible and comprehensible. In the meantime, we provide point-to-point response to your comments below:\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 1: Problem setup: They assume that the system is governed by a PDE (1). I don't see any reason why this assumption is made, or is that assumption used somewhere?\n\nResponse: We used PDE to facilitate the transition to functional variable separation and subsequently to our proposed context-aware indexing mechanism. However, we acknowledge the potential confusion it may have caused, and as a result, we have removed this equation from the paper.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 2: Section 2.1, \"Objective\" (and through the paper): They use notation . What this \" \" stands in the set? usually is used for conditioning but I cannot see such a thing here. I would rather remove this extra part here to avoid confusion (I use '(' and ')' instead of curly brackets as this form does not seem to render those (and actually, strictly speaking, '(' and ')' would be preferred if order of measurements have meaning ))\n\nResponse: Conditioning is employed in our notation because the latent codes are derived from all available position-dependent measurements at time $t$.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 3: The section 2.1 does not talk about noise or randomness and formulations in this section would indicate that is deterministic. However, later sections seems to talk about noise and assume that is includes noise or is random (e.g. Eq (5) which does not have meaning if is deterministic). This is contradicting. I would suggest authors that authors would use separate notations for a noiseless quantity and the measurements, e.g., say something like is a vector of measurements or plus noise.\n\nResponse: Thank you for your feedback. We have incorporated the suggested changes into the revised paper, and additional details regarding the model's performance under various noise levels have been included."

But there are still some parts to improve and I am not confident that if the quality is enough for publication in ICLR. \n\nAt least there points could be clarified and/or improved:\n- The key in their approach is the latent model $E$ which maps measurements from time $t$ to the latent variable, which is then fed to $D$ to get prediction of $u$ for the selected point $x$. This makes me to wonder that are measurements required for all time instants for which you want to infer $u$, meaning that the approach cannot be used to interpolate or extrapolate $u$ with respect to time? I also do not see mechanism how model could adapt to temporal behaviour of the physical system. If my interpretation is true, then the method acts more like a spatial interpolator instead of predicting a space-time system. This means that the model cannot be used, for example, for weather or climate prediction. I think this is a quite big limitation and should be addressed.  If this is not the case, I would wish to see an explanation that how the method is applied when $\\mathcal U_t$ is empty. \n\n- There are some missing details such as $\\mathcal T$ and the loss function are not specified. Appendix seems to include training details, but this section is not referenced in the main part of paper. Appendix also has some broken references (e.g below Eq (6)). These are not big things, but improves readability and I would not like to see such in published papers. \n\n- Numerical results look good, but baselines are mostly other INR methods. But I would as pointed out in the introduction, there are several other non-INR methods. I would wish to see those to be compared . Or if such comparison is done in another study, this could be referred. \n\nI increased my rating as this revision was a clear improvement, but still not sure if the manuscript is ready for publication."

                        "value": "Dear reviewer, we are grateful for your comments and questions. We find them very helpful! Particularly those pertaining to our model designs and the proposed ablation study on the Gabor filter's effects. Overall, we have revised the methodology section to elucidate the distinctions between the current INR and our approach, providing explanations for our design choices. Please find our detailed responses below.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 1: About latent code z. The paper claims to use the trainable latent code to represent temporal information instead of using time index. What is the motivation for this? Because the recorded time index is not reliable in this application? Or the latent code can also represent other semantic information? Previous works have shown INR can represent spatial-temporal information in a good way by adding temporal index as input coordinates.\n\nResponse: Yes, the latent code has the advantage of capturing not only temporal information but also other semantic features of the underlying physical process. Previous studies have indeed demonstrated the capability of INR to effectively capture spatialtemporal information by incorporating a temporal index as additional input coordinates. But it should be noted that different from forecasting problems, the time index ($t$) is primarily used as a reference to indicate a specific time instance in the context of field reconstruction. Motivated by the desire for a more **context-aware indexing mechanism**, we introduce a new perspective to the modeling process by utilizing a trainable latent code. Since the latent code is learned using the available measurements at time $t$ via auto-decoding, it is a more context-aware representation, which improves the performance of the INR-based decoder. We have expanded the methodology section to elaborate on these points, providing a detailed discussion on the motivation behind our model design choices and a visual comparison between the traditional INR and our proposed approach. We sincerely invite the reviewer to check the updated paper and provide any further feedback or suggestions you may have.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 2: As described in the paper, during training, both latent code and INR are trained. While during training, INR model parameters are fixed and only latent code is optimized. Since the given information is quite sparse during testing, how reliable it can be to optimize latent code? How robust this method can be when generalized across different objects? By only changing the latent code in the input of INR decoder and freezing all other model weights, can this change the decoded image in an efficient way?\n\nResponse: Thank you for the insightful question regarding the generalizability of latent codes. To investigate this aspect, we conducted additional experiments by partitioning the simulation-based data set into two subsets, each comprising 512 instances. The temporal splitting was performed in an ascending order, with the initial 512 instances assigned to subset $\\mathcal{D}_1$ and the subsequent 512 instances to subset $\\mathcal{D}_2$. Consequently, due to extrapolation in the time direction, the distributions of $\\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\\mathcal{D}_2$ could vary significantly. We trained MMGN using $\\mathcal{D}_1$. Then, keeping the decoder parameters fixed, we performed inference on $\\mathcal{D}_2$, where the only trainable parameters were the newly initialized latent codes. The results indicate a marginal increase in error, demonstrating that the proposed MMGN avoids the catastrophic forgetting issue encountered by other time-index-based INR methods when re-trained using different data set.\n\n| Data set | MSE |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|   $\\mathcal{D}_1$ | $3.997e^{-3}$ |\n|   $\\mathcal{D}_2$ | $4.012e^{-3}$ |\n\nAdmittedly, one limitation of our current work is its focus on reconstructing a selected trajectory. In the future, we plan to investigate MMGN's potential for generalization to multiple trajectories or even across various climate properties, with the goal of recovering arbitrary underlying flow maps. We have incorporated this discussion into the conclusion section of the revised paper."

Most of my concerns have been addressed. \n\nFor #3: How to understand this table when compared with the main Table 1? E.g. when other baselines are using the same encoding as the proposed MMGN, how to compare with the results in a more fair way? \n\nFor #4: Thanks for the author' efforts. I understand it may be quite challenging to finish all these experiments in the time limited rebuttal period. But I think these methods should be more significant and relevant baselines to the setting in this paper with latent variable and dynamic scenes.\n\nI have also read the other reviewer's comments. Overall, I will keep my original rating."

                    "value": "- I find the paper very hard to read. Notation and expressions in Section 3 and the last paragraph of Section 2 are confusing and it takes a long time to understand what is going on (Figure 2 helps here but the math could be clearer). Another reason is very florid prose which I'd hesitate to use in a machine learning paper. Examples: \"The endeavor to tackle the conundrum of global field reconstruction from sparse observations is currently shaping two distinct paradigms of thought\", \"raging ocean waves\", \"intricate physical fields\" (what are they?), \"we present an _innovative_ neural network approach\", \"... a singular viable option\", ...\n\n- While the narrative insists on strong novelty, all ingredients (and various combination thereof) are well known. The separation of variable idea is based on Dona et al 21, multiplicative filter networks are known, local activations (such as Gabor or wavelet) have been used in many papers, e.g. https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Saragadam_WIRE_Wavelet_Implicit_Neural_Representations_CVPR_2023_paper.html. In some sense the present paper is a multiplicative filter network with a separate treatment of time through an encoder--decoder. This is perfectly fine but in my view it limits the novelty, and there is no shortage of all sorts of implicit networks.\n\n- In real fields space and time _are_ intertwined so one needs to go beyond the rank-one decomposition f(x) g(t); Dona et al mentions a low rank version \\sum_k f_k(x) g_k(t). It is not clear to me from the current description how this required expresiveness is achieved. It would be nice to explain that more clearly.\n\n- Generally, there is a lack of insight on why this strategy is supposed to perform well and why other approaches are supposed to perform poorly. This is a more general problem: there are now hundreds of implicit networks with different hyperparameters, training strategies, etc, and very little theoretical or other understanding of their mechanics. \nWhat if you compare your approach with an optimally tuned adaptive kernel estimator? How about spline interpolation? How about a simple low pass filter? It will surely not mess up as badly as ResMLP in Figure 3.\n\n- Along the same lines, in datasets description you mention that wavelets were used for initial interpolation of satellite-based data on a grid; why not compare the described method with a sparse wavelet interpolation?"

Additionally, we are thankful for the thoughtful and practical suggestions for revising the presentation of the paper. Subsequently, we present our responses to each comment in a point-by-point manner.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 1: in experiments where you recover fields on the surface of a sphere, are you using Cartesian or spherical polar coordinates?\n\nResponse: In experiments involving the recovery of fields on the surface of a sphere, we utilize spherical polar coordinates for modeling.\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 2: why not include (different levels of) random noise in observations? this is an important test of robustness.\n\nResponse: Thank you for the suggestion. We have conducted additional experiments considering the introduction of noise to the input data. The noise level in the dataset is quantified by the channelwise standard deviation specific to that dataset. Furthermore, we introduced customized noise ratios, including scenarios with noise levels set at 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\%. The quantitative results are presented below. Additionally, we made a new figure to enhance the visualization of performance distinctions among various models in the presence of noise. The detailed discussion and presentation of these findings have been incorporated into the revised paper.\n\n| Model | Noise free | $1\\%$ | $5\\%$ | $10\\%$ |\n| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | \n|  ResMLP | $0.01852$ | $0.01895$ | $0.01969$ | $0.02214$ |\n|  FFN+P  | $0.02357$ | $0.02463$ | $0.03020$ | $0.04324$ |\n|  FFN+G  | $0.02982$ | $0.03239$ | $0.03774$ | $0.05335$ |\n|  MMGN   | $0.00448$ | $0.00452$ | $0.00629$ | $0.01387$ |\n\n---\n\nComment $\\#$ 3: I am not sure that (Izacard et al., 2019) is the right reference for sparse seismic networks and small earthquakes (or even for sparse spatial coverage in scientific data; it addresses a super-resolution problem).

We have made several improvements to the paper. Specifically, we corrected the reference in the introduction and provided a clearer explanation of the contributions. Moreover, we enhanced the methodology section by introducing the model more explicitly and illustrating the design process as well as adding a new figure."
