                    "value": "In this paper, the authors introduce a new prompting technique that decomposes conditional natural language generation (NLG) in two subtasks: first repeating the query and then generating the answer. Across a wide range of NLG tasks, testing a set of publicly available as well as closed language models, the authors show the superiority of the proposed approach over existing prompting techniques. An additional ablation study tries to investigate the main factor contributing to the performance gain, showing that the main benefits are due the query rewriting task acting as a query augmentation technique."

The analysis, which I personally find still preliminary yet the most interesting feature of the paper, successfully disentangle some aspects of the performance gain. The connection to query augmentation is especially useful as it could help in devising new ideas to design additional prompting techniques. Additionally, as shown in the paper, EchoPrompt is complementary to the reasoning-based techniques like Chain of Thought."

                    "value": "I do not find any major weaknesses in the work. I think the main one, admittedly minor, is the preliminary analysis on the effectiveness of EchoPrompt. Additional analysis work, moving some results to the appendix, would have made the paper stronger. For instance, do the multiple rephrases bring lower performance even when doing query augmentation instead of EchoPrompt? How robust is the model to wrongly rephrased sentences? Given the results on the robustness to irrelevant text I would assume this has a low impact but it is interesting to see the results. Additionally, an error analysis on the failure cases might also help better understanding the causes that make EchoPrompt successful. Please note that these are not fundamental experiments to grant acceptance of this paper in the conference, they are mostly the reason that made me give a the score I gave instead of a clear accept.\n\nI appreciated the limitations section where the authors mentioned the lack of explanation for why EchoPrompt results in performance gains. Regarding the additional computational cost, could retrieval techniques be used to fetch similar sentences rather than ask the model to generate them. Assuming the main benefits come from augmentation, this could bring the same gains and possibly reduce latency/costs.\n\nFinally, I consider the paper to be a interesting contribution in the field LM prompting. The experiments are well executed and the analysis, even though preliminary, provides interesting insights. Another strength of the contribution is its being complimentary to other prompting method. Overall, I'm in favor of seeing the paper included in the conference.\n\n\n----------\n\nMINOR\n\nTo better read the results, especially figure 4 but also in all the tables, a random baseline should be added. This is only mentioned in section 4 for Code-davinci-002. Additionally, please specify what metrics you use to evaluate your method on all the datasets presented.\n\n\nWhat version of ChatGPT backbone model was used to generate rephrased sentences (Sec 2.2)? Please add it in the manuscript.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nTYPOS\n\nFigure 2: repeatition -> repetition\n\nIn Zero-shot-CoT why was Zero capitalized?\n\nTable 2, bottom left section extra quotation mark?"

In the section on GPT-3.5-Turbo the sentence \"After manual qualitative analysis, we observe that the model generates descriptive rather than instruction-based extractable answers\" made me think that the effect of the different fine-tuning method on EchoPrompt ecould be further explored.\n\nIn Footnote 2: I did not grasp why quotation marks won't work for understanding when query rephrasing was completed? Couldn't they be used in the same way they are used for repetition?\n\nThe description of results in table 3, 4, 5, 6 are presented without always presenting the setup. I reconstructed that table 3 is few-shot setup while table 4,5, 6 are 0-shot. I'd suggest to make the tables self-contained and adding this info, as well as making clear at the begining of each paragraph presenting the results.\n\nAlthough the robustness to irrelevant text results are understandable, it'd be useul to quickly explain the features of the GSMIC-4k dataset.\n\nEven though the commonsense reasoning task is mentioned, its results, and Table 8 showing them, are never referenced in the manuscript."

The method can also be used\nin few-shot settings and in settings with no CoT, where it simply asks for a question rephrasing. The goal is to let the model reformulate the initial question, and the hypothesis is that this will lead to better results than standard prompting and standard generic CoT. The experimental comparisons show some modest gains and some modest losses relative to standard generic CoT. A set of ablation studies suggests that the performance of EchoPrompt is driven by the rephrased question."

It seems good in general to look for precedence in the cognitive or developmental literature, but I am not sure of the hypothesis that would link this work to that of Joseph and Joseph and Ross (cited on page 1). The protocols in that work are different in so many ways that the comparison seems misleading to me.\n\n2. Since the proposal is so simple, the weight of the paper rests on the results. In my view, the gains from this method seem very modest and are likely to be overshadowed by other innovations in in-context learning and/or fine-tuning.\n\n3. Comparing Table 1 with Figure 4/Table 9 suggests to me that minor rephrasings of the EchoPrompt string can lead to larger performance changes that EchoPrompt achieves over its baselines. This leaves me worried that the method is exploiting unknown and largely unknowable features of Instruct fine-tuning rather than capturing something deep about how in-context learning works."
