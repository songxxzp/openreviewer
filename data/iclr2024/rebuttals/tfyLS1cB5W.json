With a particular emphasis on the medical realm, the researchers enrich PLMs by integrating medical ontologies and their associated embeddings.\n\nA central feature of this study is the application of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) to encode medical ontologies like SNOMED CT into distinct concept vectors. This is achieved by adding an HRR layer to the transformers found in BERT, allowing for the efficient processing of clinical diagnosis codes.\n\nEmpirical results indicate that the enhanced HRR-integrated BERT model delivers superior performance compared to its standard counterpart, particularly in the context of rare diseases."

                        "value": "Thank you for your review. We appreciate your feedback and suggestions, which we have considered in updating the manuscript. \n\n**Methodological novelty:**\n\nWith respect to methodological novelty, we have clarified relevant sections of the paper, particularly the appendix. Creating VSA vectors does not lend itself well to efficient GPU matrix operations, since each concept vector requires a different number of atomic vectors to be combined, i.e. this would be a jagged array over the entire matrix. Earlier attempts at backpropagating through the VSA resulted in running out of memory or required an impractical amount of time to do backprop. We analyzed the operations we wanted to perform and identified where we could use matrix operations with multiple concept vectors to take advantage of the GPU. We also considered that HRR operations can be performed in the Fourier domain, simplifying the computational graph for circular convolution and reducing memory burden during backpropagation. Finally, we used only basic PyTorch methods and did not need to write custom GPU kernels. With these improved efficiencies, this method could scale to a greater number of relationships. We use up to 110 relationships in some more complex variations of our VSA with only 3.5 GB of VRAM. \n\n**Reproducibility:**\n\nRegarding reproducibility, we have improved clarity regarding both the mapping of ICD to SNOMED and data preprocessing. Furthermore, we have provided supplementary materials which contain all code necessary for implementation. The code is properly documented and will be released open source on publication of the manuscript. We aim with our open source code to eliminate any ambiguity that remains in the manuscript. \n\n**Experimentation:**\n\nWe have added additional evaluations on the multi-center eICU dataset to A.1. As data from eICU cannot be ordered sequentially, we were not able to apply disease prediction to the dataset. Mortality prediction applied on the eICU dataset has shown performance improvements consistent with our previous experiments. \n\nFurthermore, we have added results of additional experiments in A.2 and A.3 covering rare codes and completely unseen codes. These new results more clearly illustrate the advantages of our model, which are mainly in generalizing to codes that are less common in the training data. In A.2, we show that our HRR embeddings models outperform unstructured models on a disease prediction task for rare codes. In A.3, we show that HRR embedding models outperform unstructured models given a disease prediction task applied on a dataset containing codes that were unseen during training. More details are included in those relevant sections where we show a clear advantage of our HRR methods over unstructured embeddings.\n\nWe agree that our method does not perform dramatically better than the standard unstructured embeddings, except in extremes of rare tokens, where we have now shown a strong advantage. However, we believe the work is of interest for several additional reasons. First, while modest, we report a number of statistically significant positive results. Second, independent of performance improvements, our method improves explainability by disentangling representations of code frequency, ontological information, and description. Token frequency in particular bias transformers in ways that may be valuable to check on a decision-by-decision basis, as our method allows. \n\nFinally, although this is likely a controversial perspective, we believe our method is well motivated, so that the performance results are of scientific interest independent of whether they are positive. To reiterate briefly, the motivation is: a) There is a severe imbalance between frequencies of different codes, leading to some embeddings being poorly trained. b) Meanwhile, the code meanings are well defined within ontologies. c) Finally, vector-symbolic architectures provide a well-established method of representing such information. For these reasons, it seems inevitable to study the use of HRRs to provide transformer embeddings with this structured knowledge, so the performance outcome should be of interest even if it were negative (which it is not) and/or the method lacked explainability advantages (which it does not). \n\n*Author response to Reviewer oJkP questions continued below.*"

My personal experience informs me that ICLR rarely has such long abstracts in its published works. It is good that you are working on addressing this issue.\n\nAs for the other issues, my concerns are similar to the other reviewers'. For instance, some citations are missing, such as those for MIMIC-IV dataset. Expressions like 1-to-1 and 1-to-many are also not commonly seen. People often use one-to-one and one-to-many instead. For the main body of the paper, Section 2 contains details that are more appropriate to be discussed in Appendix, such as the method for train-test splits, number of data samples, percentages...etc. I understand that some of them do contribute to the understanding of the ideas in this paper, but it is often good to keep the paper concise since this can allow the reader to interpret the core methodology of the paper rather than setup details. If the readers are interested in further looking into those details, they can check them in Appendix instead. The mapping method discussed in Section 2.2.1 is also not very clear to read to me. The reason behind this approach is not very well-explained.\n\nLastly, I would like to kindly inform the authors that the presentation of the paper does not outweigh the first three weaknesses I mentioned.

                        "value": "Thank you for your review. We appreciate your feedback and suggestions. As per your primary suggestions, we have added additional evaluations on the multi-center eICU dataset to A.1. As data from eICU cannot be ordered sequentially, we were not able to apply disease prediction to the dataset. We performed mortality prediction on the eICU dataset with the MIMIC-trained model. There is a distribution shift because eICU counts mortality is defined in a different time window than MIMIC. However, our method showed a small performance improvement. Due to the time constraint, we could not redo the entire training process and analysis with eICU. MIMIC has advantages for our analysis because it has more patients with longer sequences of visits. However, further work with eICU would be a good direction for the future.  \n\nFurthermore, we have added results of additional experiments in A.2 and A.3 covering rare codes and completely unseen codes. These new results more clearly illustrate the performance advantages of our model, which are mainly in generalizing to codes that are less common in the training data. In A.2, we show that our HRR embeddings models outperform unstructured models on a disease prediction task for rare codes. In A.3, we show that HRR embedding models outperform unstructured models given a disease prediction task applied on a dataset containing codes that were unseen during training. More details are included in those relevant sections where we show a clear advantage of our HRR methods over unstructured embeddings.\n\nIn terms of the presentation of the paper, we have addressed all other reviewers\u2019 concerns. Please see the corresponding replies for details. Additionally, we have shortened the abstract and made edits to methodology sections to improve clarity and flow, taking into account detailed feedback from two colleagues who had not previously read the paper. \n\nAddressing your question:\n\n**Given the small performance boosts demonstrated in Table 1, I wonder under what circumstances we need to adopt the proposed method.**\n\nOur methods should be applied in use cases with imbalanced datasets and where frequency bias is undesirable. Given the existence of frequency bias in the unstructured embeddings, it is unclear how frequency bias learned by the unstructured model contributes to correct or incorrect predictions in fine-tuning tasks. The embeddings produced by our method are less dominated by frequency (as shown in the tSNE plots, Figure 2). As frequency is not a desirable bias in clinical settings, reducing frequency bias in medical AI models may improve trust. \n\nRelatedly, the method should also be used when it is important to understand a network\u2019s reliance on token frequency in a particular decision. Our method disentangles frequency information from semantic information. Transformers have a well-known frequency bias, and we have shown that frequency representation is prominent in learned embeddings. Our method incorporates token-frequency information in a structured way. Although frequency information can be important for accurate predictions (as we have shown by comparing HRRBase to HRRFreq), the frequency information in our embeddings can be added, removed, and modified as needed to examine the role of frequency on individual decisions by the network, enhancing its explainability. In principle, other elements of our embeddings could be treated in a similar way, e.g. to determine the impact of a condition\u2019s category vs. its site in the body. We acknowledge that these important points were unclear in our original submission."

By leveraging Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) to embed structured medical knowledge, they have potentially enhanced the robustness and practical significance of the methodology. This novel use of HRR in the context of deep learning for medical applications sets a new benchmark and opens up avenues for more sophisticated and nuanced models that could transform medical data analysis.\n\nQuality:\nThe research quality is commendably moderate, detailing the experimental procedures and significance testing methods. However, while it engages in beneficial discussions, there is room for deeper exploration and more rigorous analysis to elevate the robustness of the findings.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-structured, with a clear exposition of the problem, methodology, and results. The authors articulate the limitations of current transformer models in processing rare medical terms and effectively convey how their approach addresses these issues. The use of HRR is explained with sufficient detail to be understood by readers who may not be familiar with this representation method.  Particularly noteworthy is the authors' adept use of simple, relatable examples to elucidate the more abstract concepts involved, such as the Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). This approach significantly aids in demystifying the intricate process for readers who may not be inherently familiar with these techniques.\n\nSignificance:\nThe method introduced in this paper augments the capability of deep learning models to handle intricate medical data, holding promise for the creation of more precise diagnostic tools. This approach has potential implications for the progress of personalized medicine."

                    "value": "1. The manuscript could benefit from additional explanations of abbreviations such as \"SNOMED CT.\" A glossary or expanded definitions on first use would aid comprehension, especially for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n\n2. References to critical resources like the \"MIMIC-IV dataset\" are absent. Citing such resources would provide context and allow readers to assess the relevance and applicability of the data.\n\n3. Section 2.1 lacks detailed descriptions of dataset handling procedures, which is not reader-friendly for those not acquainted with the \"MIMIC-IV dataset.\" Providing more detail would enhance reproducibility and understanding.\n\n4. Section 2.2.1 does not adequately explain the rationale behind the chosen ICD mapping approach. Specifically, it is unclear why the authors did not map all ICD-10 codes directly to ICD-9 codes and subsequently to SNOMED CT, but rather employed the separate mapping method described. This decision is perplexing and warrants a thorough justification to understand the advantages or the necessity of the approach taken.\n\n5. The choice of employing a \"one-sided Dunnett\u2019s test\" in Section 3.2 is not substantiated with an explanation. It is essential for the authors to clarify this methodological decision, especially since the results in Table 1 suggest an overlap in the confidence intervals and a close proximity of mean values between the experimental and control groups. The absence of such a justification leaves readers questioning the appropriateness of the statistical test used in the analysis.\n\n6. While Section 3.3 commendably visualizes \"highly frequent codes\" and \"infrequent codes,\" the lack of separate predictive performance displays for these two categories in Table 1 is a missed opportunity. This differentiation is, after all, one of the paper's stated goals.\n\n7. Finally, the paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed method. Acknowledging and addressing potential shortcomings would strengthen the paper by providing a balanced view and suggesting directions for future research."

Could you please add a citation for the dataset to allow readers to trace the source and potentially reproduce your study?\n3. Dataset Processing Details: In Section 2.1, the description of how the dataset was processed is somewhat brief. Providing a more detailed account of the preprocessing steps would be beneficial, especially for readers who are not familiar with the dataset. Could you elaborate on this process?\n4. Rationale Behind Mapping Method: Section 2.2.1 does not sufficiently explain the reasoning behind the chosen ICD mapping method. Why did you opt for the particular mapping approach used in the study instead of mapping all ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 codes, and then to \"SNOMED CT\"? Clarifying the rationale behind this decision would be helpful.\n5. The choice of a \"one-sided Dunnett\u2019s test\" in Section 3.2 requires further explanation. Could you elaborate on the reasons for selecting this test and whether your method adheres to the assumptions of the test? Additionally, if the decision to use Dunnett's test was deliberate, why opt for a one-sided test instead of a two-sided test? Do you have supporting rationale to support this test? The clarity on these points is crucial, especially in light of the overlapping confidence intervals and closely aligned mean values between the experimental and control groups as presented in Table 1.\n6. While the visualization of \"highly frequent codes\" and \"infrequent codes\" in Section 3.3 is commendable, the performance metrics under these two categories are not separately displayed in Table 1. Displaying results across various scenarios could effectively showcase the effectiveness of your approach, especially since addressing the representation of infrequent codes is one of your stated objectives. Could you include these performance metrics in your results?\n7. A discussion on the limitations of the proposed method is noticeably absent.

We have carefully read your comments and have incorporated many of your suggestions to improve the manuscript.\n\nAnswering your questions in order:\n\n**1. The manuscript frequently uses the abbreviation \"SNOMED CT\" without providing a full explanation or definition for readers who may be unfamiliar with the term. Could you please provide a brief description of \"SNOMED CT\" and its relevance to your work in the introduction or the first instance where it is mentioned?**\n\nWe\u2019ve added a brief introduction about SNOMED CT in section 1.1 at the end of paragraph 5. More information on SNOMED CT is included in A.1 as well.\n\n**2. Dataset Citation:The \"MIMIC-IV dataset\" is a crucial element in your research, yet it lacks a proper citation or reference. Could you please add a citation for the dataset to allow readers to trace the source and potentially reproduce your study?**\n\nWe\u2019ve added citations to MIMIC-IV in paragraph 3 of section 1.\n\n**3. Rationale Behind Mapping Method: Section 2.2.1 does not sufficiently explain the reasoning behind the chosen ICD mapping method. Why did you opt for the particular mapping approach used in the study instead of mapping all ICD-10 codes to ICD-9 codes, and then to \"SNOMED CT\"? Clarifying the rationale behind this decision would be helpful.**\n\nWe\u2019ve added more detail on dataset handling to section 2.1. Briefly:\n- We used the ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes from the diagnosis table from the MIMIC-IV hosp module. \n- We filtered patients who did not have at least one diagnostic code associated with their records. \n- Sequences of codes were generated per patient by sorting their hospital visits by time. \n- Each unique code was assigned a token.\n\n\n**4. Dataset Processing Details: In Section 2.1, the description of how the dataset was processed is somewhat brief. Providing a more detailed account of the preprocessing steps would be beneficial, especially for readers who are not familiar with the dataset. Could you elaborate on this process?**\n\nWe\u2019ve moved some of our mapping methodology from section 2.2.1 to the appendix where we\u2019ve added in additional rationale (A.8). Describing the rationale:\n- ICD-10 was not mapped directly to ICD-9 to maintain preciseness of ICD-10 codes while potentially still keeping codes without mapping from ICD-10 to ICD-9.\n- OMOP mapping greatly improved the coverage (i.e. codes that have a valid mapping) of our ICD-to-SNOMED mapping to 96.5% from 77.6% when only using ICD-9/10 to SNOMED mappings. \n\n\n**5. The choice of a \"one-sided Dunnett\u2019s test\" in Section 3.2 requires further explanation. Could you elaborate on the reasons for selecting this test and whether your method adheres to the assumptions of the test? Additionally, if the decision to use Dunnett's test was deliberate, why opt for a one-sided test instead of a two-sided test? Do you have supporting rationale to support this test? The clarity on these points is crucial, especially in light of the overlapping confidence intervals and closely aligned mean values between the experimental and control groups as presented in Table 1.**\n\nWe\u2019ve added reasoning as to why we chose one-sidedness over two-sidedness in paragraph 1 of section 3.2. We chose a one-sided test because we suspected that HRR methods would improve performance above unstructured controls. \nAs the Dunnett\u2019s test is based on computing multiple t-tests, the same assumptions apply for both. Our methods follow with assumptions required by both the Dunnett\u2019s test and t-test (i.e. data is continuous, data is representative, homogeneity of variance, and distribution is approximately normal).\n\n\nAs Dunnett\u2019s test is designed for multiple comparisons of treatments to a control, it suited our case where we wished to compare our HRR configuration performance to the unstructured control. \nWe have also computed t-tests of our results which agree with our Dunnett\u2019s test analysis.\n\n\n**6. While the visualization of \"highly frequent codes\" and \"infrequent codes\" in Section 3.3 is commendable, the performance metrics under these two categories are not separately displayed in Table 1. Displaying results across various scenarios could effectively showcase the effectiveness of your approach, especially since addressing the representation of infrequent codes is one of your stated objectives. Could you include these performance metrics in your results?**\n\nThank you for this suggestion, we have added this analysis to A.2 (and to some extent, A.3) of our manuscript. We were unclear whether our approach would improve prediction of rare codes, as that may require experience with rare codes in training context. It should more directly improve predictions that have rare codes in their input."

                        "value": "For example, you say 'we suspected that HRR methods would improve performance above unstructured controls', but this statement is not sufficiently supported unless there is a strong prior. There can be significant differences between the results of one-sided and two-sided tests. Your one-sided test p-value is already close to 0.05, and the differences are minimal as seen in Table 1, which suggests that extra caution is warranted in the hypothesis testing step. Secondly, you claim that you have followed the assumptions required for the method, yet I have not observed the detailed evidence in the revised manuscript that would lead to this conclusion of 'following the assumptions'."
