                    "value": "The paper discusses subgoal reachability as a key issue in subgoal-based hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and argues that existing methods tackle this problem in a one-sided way by making one level dominant. As this can lead to shortcomings like poor exploration, the authors propose a method for improving subgoal reachability that tries to strike a balance between the levels. At its core is a subgoal reachability metric that is defined by the distance to the subgoal at the end of a subtask divided by the distance at the beginning of the subtask. By subtracting this metric as a regularization term on the higher level and an auxiliary reward term on the lower level, subgoal reachability can be improved and training stabilized. A bound for the sub-optimality of the hierarchy and experiments on HRL-typical environments are presented where the latter show that the proposed method, BrHPO, outperforms a range of HRL baselines."

                    "value": "The paper correctly identifies effective communication between the levels of a hierarchy as one of the cornerstones of successful HRL. The discussion of the shortcomings of existing methods is an adequate motivation for the proposal of a bidirectional method.\n\nThe proposed method is furthermore simple to integrate into existing subgoal-based HRL algorithms and computationally inexpensive.\n\nThe empirical results show that the regularization and reward terms speed up and stabilize training. The ablation studies adequately demonstrate that the regularization of the high-level policy results in the biggest improvement while the auxiliary reward term on the lower level has a smaller positive effect on training."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Theorem 3.2 has too many problems. First, the assumptions should be stated clearly in the Theorem itself. Instead, Assumption A.5 is only mentioned in the proof above equation (A.11). Assumption A.5 is furthermore not stated properly. On the RHS variables $s_t$, $a_t$ show up that have not been defined. Furthermore, the RHS does not depend on $s$ and $a$ anymore at all because $s$ and $a$ are taken to be distributed according to $\\pi_l$ on the RHS. What is written above (A.11) is different again. Now $s$, $a$ do not enter the expression in the expectation value anymore. An even bigger problem is that Assumption A.5 requires the environment reward to depend on the low-level policy. In the standard RL setting this is not possible and Assumption A.5 is not even satisfied in the environments considered in the experiments. This reward is furthermore not bounded as setting $g$ close to $\\hat{g}$ will make it arbitrarily large, contrary to the implicit assumption that the reward is bounded. \n\nThe problems continue in the line after (A.11). There, the claim is made that $r_l(s_j, a_j, g) \\leq r_l(s_k, a_k, g)$ for $0\\leq j \\leq k$. This is wrong, however, because $\\pi_l$ is not even optimal, and even if it were optimal, this might not hold in some environments. Below (A.13) there is another claim that is not proven, i.e., $\\mathcal{R}^{\\pi_h, \\pi_l} \\geq \\mathcal{R}^{\\pi_h^*, \\pi_l^*} $, and that is not self-evident. \nThere might be other problems in the parts of the proof I did not read but these issues alone are enough to make the proof incorrect. The bound in Theorem 3.2 is furthermore not tight at all because of a constant term $4r_\\text{max}\\gamma^k/(1-\\gamma)^2$. Because of $|V(s_0)| \\leq r_\\text{max}/(1-\\gamma)$ this term alone is bigger than a naive bound $C(\\pi_h, \\pi_l) \\leq 2r_\\text{max}/(1-\\gamma)$, assuming $r \\in [-r_\\text{max}, r_\\text{max}]$. It is therefore questionable if the bound was very useful, even if it was correct.\n\nAnother big issue with the paper is that Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC) [1] is not discussed (but only cited in passing) even though it is highly relevant. In HAC, the higher level receives a constant penalty if the lower level cannot reach its assigned subgoal. This feedback mechanism is quite similar to the regularization on the higher level of BrHPO. To see this, recall that HAC uses a shortest path objective so the reward is -1 if the goal is not reached and 0 otherwise. In the BrHPO formalism, this can be expressed via $\\mathcal{D}(s, g) =\\mathbb{1}_{d(s,g)> \\epsilon}$ where $d$ is some distance metric. Then the subgoal reachability regularization term vanishes when the subgoal is reached in a subtask and is constant otherwise, which is equivalent to the HAC case. This similarity should be discussed and it is also in conflict with the claim that other methods do not have a feedback mechanism across the levels of the hierarchy. HAC is furthermore also tackling the issue of an effective communication between the levels with its own set of methods. It should therefore be considered as a baseline.\n\nThe higher level of BrHPO is trained with the off-policy algorithm SAC. This is problematic because the lower level changes during training and the experience in the replay buffer of the higher level therefore becomes outdated. Other algorithms like HIRO or HAC have developed methods to deal with this non-stationarity and enable efficient off-policy training. It should therefore be discussed why BrHPO does not need such methods.\n\nIn the experiments section I am missing which distance measure $\\mathcal{D}$ and which mapping $\\Psi$ was used. \n\nIn the paragraph \u201cComputation load\u201d a performance guarantee is mentioned. It is not clear to me what is meant by that.\n\nIn summary, due to the many problems with the theoretical analysis and the lack of a discussion of the similarities with HAC, I cannot recommend the paper for acceptance in its current form.\n\n[1] Andrew Levy, George Konidaris, Robert Platt, and Kate Saenko.

Most equations should be simplified drastically and re-writings should be cut in favor of presenting the main idea. Theorem 3.2 (which should probably appear as Theorem 3.1?) appears not impactful in this context (and if it is, it should probably be a paper on its own).\n\nThe evaluation study, while extensive, never discusses the most important aspects: Do the benefits come at a cost? Are there instances where the additional aspects of the algorithm would hinder progress? What does this say about the usability of any other HRL approach? If the right answers could be given to these questions, the impact of the paper would be improved dramatically.\n\nAs of now, the paper remains unclear if it describes an intensive parametrization process for a few select domains or a general addition to HRL and somehow wants to present its result as both.\n\nThe \"extension in complex environment\" is in this form not helpful and should be presented clearer (with more space) or simply cut from the paper.\n\nFurthermore, the comparison to vanilla SAC certainly feels off. What happens in domains where vanilla apporaches perform better than \"laughable\"?\n\nMinor notes:\n- Use \"behavior\" not \"behaviour\" since you use American English thorughout\n- Write \"It is\" and \"cannot\" instead of \"It's\" and \"cannot\"\n- For me, Equation 2.1 should use \\langle and \\rangle instead of \\{ and \\}\n- Just below Equation 2.3, the type of \\psi should use \\to not \\mapsto"
