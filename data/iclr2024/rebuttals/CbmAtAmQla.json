                    "value": "In this paper, a peer evaluation method is proposed to improve LLM-based evaluations on open-ended question answering and alleviate potential bias and self-enhancement. The proposed peer rank process produces a more reasonable ranking of model capabilities. The peer discussion process is also proposed to help models reach mutual agreements that are more consistent with human judgement. Interesting insights are provided in experiment results and analysis, such as the LLM reviewer who leads the discussion tends to hold its opinion and Stronger LLMs tend to hold their opinions."

We are excited to find that the reviewer thinks our work focuses on a really interesting problem. We are delighted to find our paper has a good contribution(3) and presentation (3).\n# Weaknesses\n> 1. **The study seems to be limited to question answering only. LLM has many other applications such as writing reviews and generating essays. Would the proposed methods be applicable to improve evaluations on those applications as well?**\n- We kindly point out that we evaluated our model on the diverse Vicuna80 dataset encompassing a wide variety of tasks: writing, roleplay, common sense, fermi, counterfactual, coding, math, generic, knowledge, etc. Each task includes over 10 questions.\n\n> 2. **Significance of results in Table 3, 4, and 5? It'd be great if the authors could present t-test results such as p-values of the comparisons.**\n- We added significance tests for all of the results as shown below:\n- Table 3 shows the example-level correlation results for peer rank. Two-tailed t-test results are shown on the accuracy measure for our method compared to the other baselines (statistical significance is indicated with \\*(p<0.01), \\*\\*(p<0.002))\n\n| Reviewer                 | Fleiss Kappa | Accuracy |\n|--------------------------|--------------|----------|\n| GPT-3.5                  | 0.387        | 0.621    |\n| Claude                   | 0.319        | 0.607    |\n| GPT-4                    | 0.406        | 0.643    |\n| GPT-4 & Claude & GPT-3.5 | 0.403        | 0.666*   |\n| All Reviewers (Weighted) | 0.410        | 0.673**  |\n\n- Table 4 describes peer discussion accuracy on LFQA. We note that when PD happens between a model and a different model (e.g. Claude & GPT-4), results are significantly better. Statistical significance is indicated with \\*(p<0.05), \\*\\*(p<0.005). \n\n|                     | R1    | R2    | R1 lead | R2 lead | Random |\n|---------------------|-------|-------|---------|---------|--------|\n| GPT4 & Claude       | 0.729 | 0.671 |  0.743* |  0.729  |  0.729 |\n| GPT4 & GPT35        | 0.729 | 0.579 |  0.714  |  0.750* |  0.731 |\n| GPT35 & Claude      | 0.579 | 0.671 | 0.700** |  0.671  |  0.686 |\n| GPT35 & GPT35-0.8   | 0.579 | 0.650 |  0.664  | 0.686** |  0.681 |\n| Claude & Claude-0.8 | 0.664 | 0.707 |  0.693  |  0.671  |  0.680 |\n| GTP4 & GPT4-0.8     | 0.779 | 0.757 |  0.779  |  0.757  |  0.779 |\n\n- Table 5 shows the comparison of PD and PR on Vicuna80.

Is there any data contamination issues for the LLMs being tested?\n- The models tested are released before the creation of our Vicuna80 and LFQA datasets, so there should be no or little contamination happening.\n- Besides, there are no golden answers to open-ended questions in our datasets and there are possibly large sets of good answers. Thus, there are much fewer data contamination issues as compared to exam-like questions [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07176), [2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300)].\n# References\n1.

The idea behind PRD is to involve peer LLMs as reviewers to create a more fair and unbiased evaluation. PRD has two versions, Peer Rank (PR) and Peer Discussion (PD), both of which share the goal of mitigating biases in automated evaluations. Peer Rank (PR) operates in a tournament-style benchmarking setting, where LLMs compete in pairwise matches to answer open-ended questions, while in Peer Discussion (PD)  two reviewer LLMs engage in multi-turn discussions to reach a mutual agreement on pairwise scoring or preference. Experiments show that within this framework the automatic evaluation achieves higher accuracy and aligns better with human judgments."

For each pair comparison, the annotation takes on average 5-10 minutes. We pay \\\\$2-3 for each question. While in our experiments, GPT-4-based evaluation costs only about \\\\$0.015 for each question (based on token number). \u2013 Thus we believe using LLM for automatic evaluation is promising and cost-efficient. \u2013 human annotation details are included in Appendix G.\n- Beyond LLM-based automatic evaluation, another bigger scope theme of this\u00a0 work is about scalable oversight of models [[8](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03540)]. \u2013 Enable models to induce self-rankings that are hard for humans to compare.\n\n> 2. **On the same line, this work does not consider open-source LLMs. Knowing what open-source LLM can be used here could be beneficial for the community.**\n- Open-source LLMs are always an important part of the community. The original paper already includes experiments involving Vicuna-13b which is an original model based on LLaMA [[10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)].\n- Additionally, we designed a new experiment for the PR method including new public models: Zephyr-7b-alpha [[9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16944)], Vicuna-13b (already discussed in the paper),\u00a0 and GPT-3.5. The results are consistent with Table 2 in the paper.\n\n**New results:**\n- **We show that both ranking and Elo change and become closer to the golden ranking when using PR**, which is consistent with the experiments of commercial LLMs.\n\n|         |  All |      | All (Weighted) |      | Human Raters |      |\n|---------|:----:|:----:|:--------------:|:----:|:------------:|:----:|\n| Models  |  Elo | Rank |       Elo      | Rank |      Elo     | Rank |\n| Vicuna  |  999 |    2 |     1011 (-47) |    1 |         1058 |    1 |\n| Zephyr  | 1010 |    1 |      1003 (+3) |    2 |         1000 |    2 |\n| GPT-3.5 |  991 |    3 |      993 (+52) |   3  |      941     |   3  |\n\n# Questions\n> 1.

The goal is to propose new methods using LLMs for better and fair evaluations that align with human judgments. \n\t- The basic task formulation is like, given answers A and B, the model is required to evaluate which of them is better.\n\t- Determining pairwise comparison is also a key step for InstructGPT training [7].\n- To get an overview and basic knowledge of the topic, we kindly refer the reviewer to skim a set of related work on LLM-based evaluation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], where [1] is a very basic model in this direction.\n\n> 2. **Proposed solution**\n- We propose (1) the peer rank (PR) algorithm that takes into account each peer LLM\u2019s pairwise preferences of all answer pairs and outputs a final ranking of model capabilities;\n- And (2) peer discussion (PD), where we prompt two LLMs to discuss and try to reach a mutual agreement on preferences of two answers.\n\n> 3. **Results**\n- We conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. We find that our approaches achieve significantly higher accuracy and better alignment with human preference.\n\n# Questions\n> 1. **Is the aim of your method to help LMs produce better answers to questions than other methods currently achieve?**\n- As outlined in the abstract and introduction, our aim is to **introduce improved evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs)** that enhance accuracy and better align with human judgments. Our research opens up possibilities for assessing models that are challenging for humans to compare.\n\n**Finally, we are eager to answer any further questions from the reviewer to help fully understand the intellectual merits of our work.**\n\n# References\n1.

At each time, a reviewer compares the outputs generated by two contestants and decides which is better. The weight of the evaluation made by a reviewer LLM is based on its performance. The weights are computed in an iterated manner. This algorithm can be used when the scoring methods are both win rates and Elo ratings. \n\n- Peer Discussion (PD): Given two answers generated by two contestant LLMs, two reviewer LLMs assess which answer is better separately, and then the two reviewer LLMs engage in a structured discussion to reach a mutual agreement on the preferences for two given answers. \n\nThe methods are intended to produce evaluations that are more aligned with human judgment and can mitigate self-enhancement bias and position bias."

                        "value": "We sincerely thank the reviewer for constructive feedback. We are encouraged to find that the reviewer finds our work benefits to further research.\n# Weaknesses\n> 1. **Limited improvements PR. Elo rating becomes closer to human raters' rating, but the ranking of the five LLMs does not change.**\n- We would politely point out that the Elo score is a more fine-grained and important metric for comparing model capabilities. Recent works [1, 2, 3] all used it as the main metric. This metric is important even if the ranking doesn\u2019t change in the specific case. The Elo rating of \"All (Weighted)\" is the closest to human rating. It shows our method has a better alignment with human judgment.\n- Ranking is more general and coarse-grained and is not informative when the gap of model capabilities is large. Thus it\u2019s more convincing to review the rank when including models that are of similar capabilities (on a challenging set of questions). \u2013  we added new experiments including another set of LLMs.\n\n**Additional Experiment:**\n- In the new experiments, we added new public LLM and conducted PR among Vicuna-13b, Zephyr-7b-alpha, and GPT-3.5. **We show that both ranking and Elo change and become closer to the golden ranking**, which is consistent with the experiments of commercial LLMs. This change demonstrates PR also contributes to adjusting the global ranking.\n\n|         |  All |      | All (Weighted) |      | Human Raters |      |\n|---------|:----:|:----:|:--------------:|:----:|:------------:|:----:|\n| Models  |  Elo | Rank |       Elo      | Rank |      Elo     | Rank |\n| Vicuna  |  999 |    2 |     1011 (-47) |    1 |         1058 |    1 |\n| Zephyr  | 1010 |    1 |      1003 (+3) |    2 |         1000 |    2 |\n| GPT-3.5 |  991 |    3 |      993 (+52) |   3  |      941     |   3  |\n\n\n> 2. **In Table 3, the example-correlation does not increase too much, comparing \"All Reviewers (Weighted)\" to \"GPT-4 & Claude & GPT-3.5\". These indicate that the core idea of PR may not be very useful.**\n- \"GPT-4 & Claude & GPT-3.5\" is also an important variation of our PR approach of the weighted combination of all reviewers. The \u201cAll reviewers (Weighted)\u201d includes two additional models. Both of them significantly outperform the baselines according to the significance test (>2%).\n\n>3. **In Table 5, the performance boost with PD is not that great**\n- We conducted a two-tailed t-test and results show that p-value of PD as compared to the baseline is smaller than 0.01, demonstrating significant improvement. \u2013 we will add this to the final version.\n\n> 4. **The two proposed methods are weakly related, except that they both introduce \"peers\" to some extent. The paper doesn't combine the two, which makes me feel cut off.**\n- We politely argue that PR and PD are closely interrelated and fall under the same theme of providing a more fair (de-biased) ranking of long- and free-form answers. PR is for global ranking and PD is for fine-grained ranking.\n- In Table 5 we compare their performance and provide insights on the difference between PR and PD and their benefits.\n- Plus, we integrated them into one unified peer evaluation framework, i.e. first using PR to determine the weight of each LLM reviewer, and then conducting fine-grained PD among them, the first prunes out the weak LLMs and the second step enables more explainable evaluation decisions (discussion history). Through the study, we found that it achieves good efficiency and satisfiable results.\n- We will add more details in the final version and adjust the corresponding part to make the connection sound more smooth.\n\n> 5. **Introducing the communication between LLMs to obtain a better solution will require computational cost.**\n- We admit that the cost of calling API-based commercial LLMs might be an issue, but it is more fair and is commonly used for evaluations in recent research literature. Such as for evaluating model performance on open-ended questions [3, 4],\u00a0 summarization [5], dialogue generation [6], etc.\n- Moreover, illustrating the decision process through multi-round LLM interactions is an essential part of recent work on model explainability, in topics such as evaluation [7], scalable oversight of model capabilities [8], and code optimization and text generation [9] \u2013 we will add this to the final version.\n- In our work, we hired domain experts such as food science experts (from Upwork: [http://upwork.com](http://upwork.com)) for the human pairwise comparison annotations. For each pair comparison, the annotation takes on average 5-10 minutes. We pay \\\\$2-3 for each question. While in our experiments, GPT-4-based evaluation costs only about \\\\$0.015 for each question (based on token number). \u2013 Thus we believe using LLM for automatic evaluation is promising and cost-efficient.\n- Beyond LLM-based automatic evaluation, another bigger scope theme of this work is about scalable oversight of models [10]. \u2013 Enable models to induce self-rankings that are hard for humans to compare."
