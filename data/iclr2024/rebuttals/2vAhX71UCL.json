The authors need to explain what efforts the authors have made to address this issue.\n\n**Temporally** Lack of integration of action semantics and temporal modeling, which leads to the incongruity of target motions. *e.g.,* the transition from eating to dancing in Figure 1.\n\n2. The proposed method is computationally expensive due to the introduction of VDMs."

In page 5, the authors say:*Technically, the model is trained on a sequence of frames u by replacing the temporal attention layers by trivial fixed masks ensuring the model only pays attention within each frame, and also by masking the residual temporal convolution blocks.* What do you mean about temporal attention layers? Why use an unordered set of M frames? In my opinion, the former is a technical operation at the model level, while the latter is a processing at the data level. Is there any necessary connection between the two technologies?\n\n2. Can the authors explain why extending this method to animation generation works? After all, an image cannot provide temporal information about actions, and how to ensure the continuity of video frames is a key issue."

While our mixed finetuning strategy significantly improves fidelity, we recognize that appearance smoothness remains an area for improvement. Our focus, however, is primarily on motion generation, and we anticipate that advancements in VDM resolution will naturally enhance the appearance fidelity of Dreamix without requiring additional modifications.\n\n2. **Computational Cost:** The reviewer correctly notes the computational expense introduced by our method due to the utilization of VDMs. We share this concern and believe that new advancements, e.g. latent consistency model ideas, will likely mitigate this computational expense of VDMs, making the method more efficient.\n\n3. **Writing:** The reviewer is correct, we will try to clarify the writing.\n\n4. **Animation Capability:** We hypothesize that the pretraining of the VDM endows it with robust capabilities to predict motion patterns even from a single frame, contributing to the success of our method in animation generation.\n\nWe appreciate the insightful questions and concerns raised by the reviewer."

We showcase different video generation tasks and propose enhancements to an existing VDM, demonstrating, for the first time, motion edits of a video. The significance of this research therefore extends beyond the technical novelty, particularly by its insights and applicability.\n\n2. **Fidelity:** The input, coupled with our mixed finetuning strategy, contributes to the details, as evidenced in Table 3. We openly discuss the limitation of lower resolution generation in our paper under the limitations section.\n\n3. **Image-driven video generation:** While there is some resolution degradation between the input image and the generated results, our method is able to add motion and animate the scene in a manner that no other method can currently perform. Moreover, AnimateDiff is irrelevant for this application as it expects a \u201cDreambooth\u201d like model as input, which requires a set of images instead of a single image. However, following the suggestion of reviewer \u201cUUNx\u201d, we conducted a detailed comparison to current methods.  VideoComposer, Gen-2, and PikaLabs. All the methods failed to add large motion or add objects to the image and animate them.\n\n4. **Subject-driven video generation:** We acknowledge that some fine details are not fully preserved, as discussed in the paper. Attempting a comparison with AnimateDiff for subject-driven video generation did not yield satisfactory results, as AnimateDiff is tailored for small motion generation and struggles with larger motions found in our examples (e.g., walking and drinking beer).\n\nWe value the reviewer's insights, and we hope these clarifications address their concerns adequately."

                    "value": "1. The comparison with previous works is not comprehensive. For text-based video editing, FateZero [ref-1] and TokenFlow [ref-2] are more advanced methods designed for video editing. \nFor subject-driven video generation, Animatediff [ref-3] can learn a Lora model from several images and generate corresponding videos. For animating a single image, VideoComposer [ref-4] can generate video conditioned on the single image and text, which does not require additional transformation. These methods should be discussed and compared in the experiments and related work.\n\n[ref-1] Fatezero: Fusing attentions for zero-shot text-based video editing.\n\n[ref-2] TokenFlow: Consistent Diffusion Features for Consistent Video Editing.\n\n[ref-3] Animatediff: Animate your personalized text-to-image diffusion models without specific tuning.\n\n[ref-4] VideoComposer: Compositional Video Synthesis with Motion Controllability.\n\n2. The performance of motion editing is not satisfactory. This paper claims motion editing as one of the key contributions. However, as shown in Figure 7, the motion and appearance are from the video generation model (Uncond.), while Dreamix seems only to help to learn the background. From my perspective, motion editing should focus on keeping the same identity while changing the motion, instead of keeping the background. \n\n3. The proposed method heavily relies on the choice of video generation model. For both single-image animation and subject-driven video generation, only frame-level finetuning is adopted ($\\alpha$ in Eq.3 is 0). This requires the video generation model to handle single images, which may not be satisfied easily by other video generation models. It is better to verify the method on an open-source video generation model (e.g., [modelscope](https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/modelscope-damo-text-to-video-synthesis))\n\n4. During video editing, the degraded source video with noise is used as the initialization. In comparison, most video editing methods adopt DDIM inversion as initialization. It is better to compare the two methods.\n\n5. **Minor**. I hope the authors can check the `\\citep` and `\\citet` in the LaTex template and improve the writing."

                        "value": "We appreciate the thorough review and have carefully considered their feedback:\n\n1. **Baseline Comparisons:**\n    - **FateZero and TokenFlow:** We conducted preliminary experiments on these methods, and while they excel in appearance editing with impressive temporal consistency, they are unable to perform motion edits, which is the core of our work.\n\n    - **AnimateDiff:** We tested AnimateDiff on subject-driven video generation, but the results were not satisfactory. AnimateDiff, designed for small motion generation, faced challenges with the large motions in our examples (e.g., walking and drinking beer).\n\n    - **Image-driven video generation:** Following the reviewer's suggestion, we tested VideoComposer. In addition, we tested Gen-2, and PikaLabs (both commercial products). All methods failed to add significant motion or add objects to the input image and animate them.\n\n2. **Motion Editing Capabilities:** We respectfully disagree with the reviewer's claim about Dreamix's motion editing. Dreamix learns both background and foreground, adding motion to both. While there might be cases where fidelity is slightly compromised for smoother videos with minor appearance changes, Dreamix is the only current method that is able to preserve such a high level of fidelity while still allowing for motion editing.  We refer the reviewer to our supplementary videos where the importance of Dreamix is more apparent.\n\n3. **Applicability to Other VDM Backbones:** We conducted preliminary experiments, and the results align with our paper's claims that \u201cVideo diffusion models are general video editors\u201d. Applying our method to the ModelScope backbone shows improved temporal consistency and editing capabilities compared to image-based methods but falls short of the power demonstrated by the much larger VDM backbone used in our paper.\n\n4. **Initialization Method:** We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting idea to investigate, however, this is out of scope for our current work.\n\n5. **Citations:** We appreciate the suggestion and will review and improve the writing accordingly.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for their insights, and we hope these clarifications address their concerns appropriately."

This paper conducted editing experiments on a single VDM base model, making it difficult to ascertain whether the proposed method is applicable to other VDMs e.g., modelscope or if the observed results are solely due to the characteristics of the base model. This is somewhat inconsistent with the title of the paper.   \n\n2. The comparisons with Tune-A-Video are not fair. Tune-A-Video is finetuned on image diffusion model but dreamix is finetuned on video diffusion model.\n\n\n3. When compared with other VDMs, only the motion editing capabilities (Figure 7) were assessed, and there is no comparison of appearance editing capabilities. This doesn't adequately showcase the impact of mixed-attention fine-tuning.\n\n4.  Lacks specific information. Imagen Video operates on a series of diffusion models. It is unclear which components undergo fine-tuning during the process. Is there a necessity to fine-tune the super-resolution diffusion models as well? or only key frames diffusion model is enough."

Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have also compared our method to the original version of ModelScope, the results reinforce our claims of improvement over the original ModelScope.\n\n3. **Appearance Editing Comparisons:** Contrary to the reviewer's observation, we did assess both motion and appearance editing capabilities. Please refer to Tables 1 and 2, where the comparison results cover the entire dataset (detailed in Table 3).\n\n4. **Implementation Details:** These details are available in Appendix C.2.
