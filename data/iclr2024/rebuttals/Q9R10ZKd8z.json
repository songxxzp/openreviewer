                        "value": "Thank you for reviewing our paper! Please let us address your concerns and questions:\n\n- **W1**: The statement is not meaningless. Many neural CO methods cannot be used on more than the TSP or some other simple CO problem without significant changes, if they can be used on other problems at all. This work seeks a problem independent method of generating diverse solutions. Even though we focused on routing problems, the mechanism itself is general and requires no modification for other types of CO problems (scheduling, assignment, etc.) \n- **W2**: We are not sure what you mean by that. Can you please elaborate? \n- **W3**: We are not sure what you mean by that. Can you please elaborate? \n- **W4**: Would you prefer it if our method would be more complicated and achieve the same results? We make a number of significant changes to the POMO and PolyNet method that lead to stark performance improvements. Achieving significant performance improvements while maintaining simplicity and efficiency is a commendable achievement.\n- **W5**: We also show the performance of our method without EAS (where it outperforms all other ML methods). We do not see how providing additional results for PolyNet with EAS reduces our contribution. Not all neural CO methods can be combined easily with effective search techniques, thus it is an advantage of PolyNet that EAS can enhance its performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n- **Q1**: This is not mentioned in the paper. \u201cPolyNet\u201d uses the Greek word \"poly,\" which means \"many\" or \"multiple\". We chose the name because PolyNet is able to generate multiple diverse solutions.\n- **Q2**: A 1% solution improvement in the area of vehicle routing is very significant as it often translates to tangible cost savings and enhanced resource utilization, contributing to overall efficiency. Even much smaller improvements can provide a competitive advantage.\n- **Q3**: Our approach is not designed for such large problem instances. We refer to our responses to reviewers 2aWJ and 2arF as to why scaling to such large problem sizes is not a valid criteria for judging this work."

If the aim is to obtain diverse solutions, it seems that there is a lack of mechanisms in the learning process to ensure that the K solutions have distinct characteristics.\n\n2. I believe that the approach focuses more on creating K distinct solutions and utilizing them to build a baseline and find the best solution, which is closer to an exploitation strategy for policy learning than generating diverse solutions.\n\n3. I understand that the training uses the best-performing solution among the K solutions, and it seems like the policy learned in this way might tend to overfit to that best solution, improving its performance rather than generating diverse solutions.\n\n4. What is the reason for the effectiveness of the shared baseline composed of K generated solutions?\n\n5. I'm curious about the reason why solution uniqueness is higher in PolyNet compared to POMO. Since there doesn't appear to be a mechanism to explicitly increase uniqueness in the objective function, I wonder if there is causality in the results. I'm also interested in understanding why high uniqueness is desirable when, ultimately, only the best solution is used. Why is it necessary to have diverse solutions?\n\n6. If K vectors are not used, and K solutions are generated using the same policy and the same approach, what would be the resulting outcome?"

Please let us address your concerns and questions:\n\t\n- **Q1**: The goal of our approach is to generate better solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. Increasing solution diversity is only a means to an end. We now make this more clear in the paper.\n- **Q2**:  Did you mean to write \u201cexploration strategy\u201d? In that case, you are right.  Our approach creates diverse solutions with the intention to enable wider exploration of strategies and training and test time.\n- **Q3**:  It is not a problem if there is a strategy that is better than all other strategies on a specific instance as long as the other strategies work well on other instances. We only care about the quality of the best found solution (and neither about the quality of the other solutions nor their diversity).\n- **Q4**: The baseline serves the purpose of stabilizing the training process. The adjustment of strategies is not based on the absolute costs achieved, as interpreting these costs can be challenging due to their dependency on both the solution and the instance. Instead, strategies are adjusted relative to how much better they performed compared to other evaluated strategies. This approach allows for a more meaningful and comparative assessment of the strategies, considering their performance in relation to each other rather than focusing solely on absolute cost values.\n- **Q5**:  We are interested in a high-diversity among generated instances because it increases exploration and allows us to find \u201cbetter best solutions\u201d. If we take a model that offers no solution diversity and generate 800 solutions to a single instance, all solutions will be identical. In contrast, if we use a model with high diversity to generate 800 solutions, all 800 solutions will be different. Assuming that the second model generates not only diverse solutions but also reasonably good solutions, we likely find a better solution in the set of 800 diverse solutions. \nIn PolyNet the diversity is increased using the Poppy loss function. The successful implementation of this technique is visually evident in Figure 3 of the paper. When training with PolyNet the solution diversity increases and (more importantly) the quality of the best found solutions increases. We also updated the Figure to include results for continued training of the POMO model to show that POMO does not profit from more training. \n- **Q6**:  Since the policy is conditioned on the additional input vectors, we can not use the same policy without providing K input vectors. Furthermore,the baseline requires a reasonable high value for K (>= 8) during training. At test time, we could sample solutions from only one of the K vectors which would result in decreased solution diversity."

                    "value": "Significance and novelty:\n\n* The technical novelty is slightly limited. The idea of enhancing diversity (similar to EAS [3] and FER [4])  and the integration of additional trainable layers in the POMO decoder (similar to EAS [3] and PMOCO [5]) is not new. \n* The addressed TSP and CVRP are relatively small-scale. Many recent works can solve much larger sizes like 10,000 nodes, e.g., DIFUSCO [6].\n\nEvaluation:\n* PolyNet added a new residual block to the POMO pre-trained model decoder for further training. However, the baseline models, POMO, Poppy and EAS, did not seem to undergo such extended training. The baseline models should also be trained further for a fair comparison. \nMeanwhile, it is unclear how long the additional training is. It is also unclear why PolyNet was not trained from scratch. It's interesting to understand how its performance is when training from scratch.\n* It is unclear whether the good performance is attributed to EAS, additional training, or the added layers with bit vector inputs. More evaluation may be needed, e.g., testing PolyNet\u2019s performance over longer inference without EAS, comparing the results of training from scratch and/or additional training (baselines also undergo extended training), and verifying the necessity of the proposed residual block design (e.g., can we change the bit inputs to random values? Can the hyper-network of PMOCO with additional training achieve similar performance?)\n* In Figure 4, it seems that both POMO and PolyNet display comparable levels of diversity, though PolyNet found solutions with lower costs. This appears to contradict the primary intention behind PolyNet, which is to amplify diversity. The results raise the question of whether the enhanced performance of PolyNet is due to diversity or if other underlying factors at play contribute to this outcome. \n\nWriting:\n\nThe title and some claims have inaccuracies. For instance, the title and other sections mention \u201capplicability to a wider range of CO problems\u201d, but all experiments are conducted only on VRPs. The paper claims that it focuses on practical problems that have many constraints, but the experiments are limited to simple problems like CVRPTW and CVRP. The paper also mentions an \"unlimited learnable policy\", but the number of decoders is restricted by K. \n\n```\nReferences:\n[1] POMO: Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima for Reinforcement Learning\n[2] Population-Based Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization\n[3] Efficient Active Search for Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n[4] Learning Feature Embedding Refiner for Solving Vehicle Routing Problems\n[5] Pareto Set Learning for Neural Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization\n[6] DIFUSCO: Graph-based Diffusion Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization\n```"

                        "value": "Thank you for reviewing our paper! Please let us address your concerns and questions:\n\n**Significance and novelty** \n\n- The concept of enhancing solution diversity in a search algorithm or inserting new layers into an existing model isn't novel. Indeed, we can cite papers from far earlier than the papers provided in the ML literature. What sets our work apart is our ability to generate varied solutions using a model with a single decoder, showcasing significantly improved performance. This has a number of advantages over the approaches in the ML literature (which rely on multiple decoders) and the OR literature (which rely mostly on randomness). Thus, the novelty is absolutely sufficient for ICLR and we believe our decoder mechanism will have an influence on future autoregressive decoder designs.\n\n- For larger instances of the CVRP and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW), there is currently a lack of end-to-end machine learning approaches. Existing methods, such as DIFUSCO, focus solely on the TSP due to its simpler constraints, enabling non-autoregressive solution generation. In our research, we concentrate on more intricate problems like CVRP and CVRPTW. Even with instances ranging from 100 to 500 nodes, achieving optimal solutions remains extremely challenging, emphasizing the continued importance of developing heuristics for problems of this magnitude. Note that common CVRP benchmarks from the operations research (OR) literature mostly have the same sizes as the problems we examine. This is because size is not the only criteria for the hardness of real-world problems. We encourage the reviewer to orient their thinking on the OR literature, which has been solving these problems for many years. Thus, our work serves to narrow the divide between machine learning and traditional OR methods by orienting the datasets on real problem sizes and structures.\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n- **Additional training of the baseline methods**: In our efforts to enhance baseline methods, Poppy underwent additional training, following the same training protocol as PolyNet, initiated from an already trained POMO model and spanning an identical number of epochs. We have updated our paper to reflect this information. It's worth noting that the POMO model, having been trained to near convergence, does not experience any notable benefits from further training. This assertion is supported by our inclusion of results for additional training in Figure 4. Notably, EAS does not require any training at all. \\\n**Training from scratch**: Furthermore, for a comprehensive analysis, we initiated training runs from scratch, and the outcomes of these efforts will be presented in the camera-ready version of our paper.\n\n- **Reason for the good performance**: We have already provided results for PolyNet without EAS in Table 4., affirming that its quality performance is not solely attributed to EAS. Additionally, despite Poppy undergoing identical training to PolyNet, it exhibits inferior performance on identical instances. This observation suggests that PolyNet's superior performance is not merely a result of additional training. Instead the enhanced performance of PolyNet is likely attributable to the novel model architecture and the refined training setup. Importantly, these two components are interdependent, and their effectiveness cannot be evaluated independently.\\\n**Comparison to PMOCO**: PMOCO is designed to solve multi-objective optimization problems and is hence not well-suited for the single objective problems considered in this paper.\n\n- **Figure 4**: PolyNet does not only focus on solution diversity, but aims to increase solution diversity and solution quality alike. Figure 4 shows the trade-off between these two objectives. Overall, PolyNet finds solutions that are better than those of POMO with respect to these two objectives (also see Appendix A). To allow for a direct comparison of the solution diversity of POMO vs. PolyNet, we updated Figure 3 to include POMO.\n\n**Writing**\n\t\n- **Considered problems**: We are currently working on including results for the flexible flow shop problem. The results will be included in the camera-ready version of the paper.\n- **Practical problems**: The CVRPTW in particular is significantly more complex than most other problems considered in the neural combinatorial optimization literature. We hence see our work as an important step to more complex problems.\n- **\u201cUnlimited learnable policy\u201d**: We rephrased this statement to make it more clear."

The paper demonstrates promising performance with simple designs, which could have a positive impact. However, the paper currently falls short in providing a thorough evaluation and discussion. It particularly lacks depth in explaining the performance origins of PolyNet, the rationales and unique benifits behind the proposed residual block designs, and whether the performance improvements are due to increased diversity. . For these reasons, I will maintain my initial review score."

However, my main concern remains the lack of thorough discussion and evaluation to substantiate the benefits of the proposed design changes. The assertion that the added layer and refined training setup are interdependent, leaves me unconvinced. In my initial review, I recommended further evaluations to ascertain the unique benefits and necessity of the newly added layer. Possible ways include replacing the residual block with PMOCO's hyper network, using random bit inputs instead of one-hot coding, or applying the introduced layers in the EAS-lay as a trainable layer atop a pre-trained POMO model. Subsequently, one could conduct similar additional training to determine whether the design of the residual block or the additional training itself contributes more significantly to the model's enhanced performance.\n\nThere is also several unanswered questions:\n\n- What is PolyNet's performance when operating independently, especially over longer inference periods (consider the simialr runtime ofthe guided group's), without EAS?\n- What is the total wall time required for the additional training?\n- How does PolyNet perform when trained from scratch? Any preliminary insights?\n\nAdditionally, upon a carefully re-evaluation of the paper's contributions adn check the experiments of POMO and EAS, I acknowledge the admirable performance gains. Should my above concerns be adequately addressed, I am happy  to reconsider and increase my score."

                        "value": "Thank you for reviewing our paper! Please let us address your concerns and questions:\n\n**High computational complexity**: We solve problems of sizes relevant for many real-world contexts. Let us emphasize that the standard datasets in Operations Research for the CVRP, etc., also focus on problems of this size because this is what the vast majority of companies are interested in. As this work is trying to move the field of neural CO towards real-world impact, it makes sense that we would focus on these problems. Note that we are open about the scaling limitation of this work and state in the discussion that the computational complexity of our method limits its applicability to routing problems with less than 1,000 nodes. \n\n**Performance**: PolyNet outperforms all other state-of-the-art approaches for the routing problems we consider. In Tables 1, 2, and 3, PolyNet is faster than all other approaches except for POMO with greedy action selection (and POMO with sampling in one case). In addition to being faster, PolyNet finds significantly better solutions for all three problems.\n\n\n\n**Q1**: \u201cOn table 1, there is no information about the performance o [sic] PolyNet EAS on Test 10K instances.\u201d \n\nYes, we did not conduct these experiments because PolyNet without EAS already finds solutions with a gap of 0.000% to optimality and it is hence impossible to meaningfully improve the solution quality further. However, we agree that the missing values might be confusing, and we now include results for these experiments in the paper.\n\n**Q2**: \u201cIn Table 4, does the poppy method have the forced first move or free first move?\u201d \n\nWe implement Poppy as proposed by the authors without any modifications. This means that for Poppy the first move is always forced. We note that Poppy (similar to POMO) has been designed around this mechanism and that replacing it with our free first move selection would require extensive changes to the method.\n\n**Q3**: \u201cFor part 3.4, can you explain more about how the diversity can be increased via the loss function?\u201d\n\nIn our approach, we implement the diversity-enhancing mechanism explained in the Poppy paper. Given the page limit constraint, we present a concise overview of this mechanism and direct readers to the detailed exposition in the Poppy paper. Our strategy for fostering diversity involves sampling K solutions per instance and subsequently updating the model weights based on the best sampled solutions. While this approach doesn't explicitly enforce diversity, it serves as an incentive for the model to acquire varied strategies in order to optimize overall performance. It's crucial to emphasize that our pursuit of diversity is fundamentally a means to enhance solution quality, a goal we have effectively achieved. To enhance clarity, we have revised accordingly.\n\n**Q4**: \u201cCan you clarify more \u201cThis approach generates a diverse set of instances in a parallel and independent manner, making it particularly suitable for real-world decision support settings where little time is available?\u201d. Can we say that the selected testing instances are represented for real-world decision support?\u201d\n\nIn the case of CVRPTW, we have taken great care to have a real-world relevant dataset. We employ the CVRP instance generator detailed by Queiroga et al. (2021). This generator produces clustered customer positions that closely emulate real-world scenarios, introducing a layer of realism to our evaluation. In essence, while our instances may not directly mirror real-world problems, the structural design of our CVRPTW instances aligns with those encountered in practical scenarios and corresponds to instances commonly employed in the operations research literature.\n\nIn the case of the TSP and CVRP, we evaluate PolyNet on simple instances, as these problems are not real world anyway. In the case of TSP, the node positions are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution, facilitating seamless comparisons with other machine learning papers. \n\n**Q5**: \u201cPart 3.5: Why did not you combine PolyNet with SGBS?\u201d\n\nIntegrating PolyNet with SGBS is non-trivial due to the way PolyNet generates solutions and SGBS performs its search. We made a first attempt at integrating the two methods, but are not yet satisfied with its performance and have thus delayed the task of fully integrating the two methods for future work."
