                    "value": "I will separate my concerns into two parts; one on the theoretical analysis and one on the empirical experiments.\n\n**Theoretical**\n- The use of $\\mathbb{E}$ for the *empirical* expectation is very unconventional, and I would strongly suggest to change this notation. This also conflicts with mentions of distributions later on. It is unclear when we are considering random variables and emprical observations.\n- *\"[...] of the distillation data, which is often reused from the teacher\u2019s training data.\"* It appears as reusing the teacher's training data is an underlying assumption of the paper, which is a notable assumption, and should be stated explicitly as an assumption.\n- *\"In particular, minimization of Eq. (1) would lead to $f(x) = 1(y)$ for any input x, [...]\"*. Why does this hold? There are no assumptions on $\\ell(f(x), y)$ in (1), and the statement would not hold in general?\n- Page 4 above (3). Is this the same softmax as other places? If not, why? If so, fix notation.\n- *\"[...] a continuous distribution with finite variance, namely $\\mathrm{Var}[X|z] \\leq \\nu_z$\"*. Note, $\\mathrm{Var}[X|z] \\leq \\nu_z$ is *bounded* variance not only finite variance. What is the true assumption here?\n\n**Empirical**\n- The authors never compares to the conventional and very simple setting of early-stopping the teacher and/or carefully tuning the temperature scaling of the teacher predictions as is commonly done in practice.\n- You both state that *\"This demonstrates that our regularizations are not sensitive to hyperparameter selection.\"* and argue that *\"It is thus\npossible to further boost the performance by careful hyperparameter tuning\"*, which seems contradicting.\n- About Figure 2(a): *\"[...] the teacher accuracy constantly decreases while the student accuracy increases and converges.\"* The teacher accuracy does not constantly decrease, but at best appear to have a downward trend. Furthermore, it is a stretch to say that the student accuracy converges due to no increase in 1 of 4 intervals. *\"This demonstrates that excessively strong Lipschitz regularization hurts the performance of neural network training [...]\"*. This is not supported by the figure where the teacher test accuracy for $\\lambda_{LR} = 0.5 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ and $\\lambda_{LR} = 2 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ is equal. Hence, the stronger regularization does not really affect the teacher performance.\n- Throughout the paper, it is argued that a reduced teacher performance can yield improvements in the student generalization. However, from Figure 2(c)  at the performance of both the teacher and the student increase when using the cosine, cycle or piecewise schedules compared to the standard procedure. In fact, only the case of linear schedule (used elsewhere in the paper) show an increase in student performance combined with a decrease in teacher performance. Thus, it is unclear what the effect the experiments actual show? Is the improvement merely an artifact of other parts of the training scheme?\n- There are no comparisons to Park et al. (2021), \"Learning Student-Friendly Teacher Networks for Knowledge Distillation\", although they provide experimental analysis on identical settings as this paper, and appear to notably outperform the proposed SoTeacher procedure. Granted, Park et al. (2021) propose a more involved procedure, but a comparison is needed.\n- Section on Student fidelity: Care must be taken, when interpreting teacher-student agreement (as argued by Stanton (2021)). Improved agreement does not imply that the student learns better from the teacher. This can merely be an artifact of improved student performance (or decreased teacher performance).\n\n**Minor**\n- The introduction lacks reference to Mirzadeh et al (2020), \"Improved Knowledge Distillation via Teacher Assistant\" on the teacher-student gap.\n- *\"[...] namely $x_z := \\gamma(x_z)$.\"* Overloaded notation here. Also, there is an inconsitent use of $x_{z_m}$ vs. $x_m$. For instance, it is unclear what $x_m$ in $h_m := f_E(x_m)$ refers to?\n- *\"[...] for any two inputs $i$ and $j$ [...]\"* and other places. It is odd to refer to inputs by their indices. Replace by $x^{(i)}$ or write *\"[...] for any two inputs indexed by $i$ and $j$ [...]\"*\n- Mention somewhere that the proofs are in the appendix.\n- Table 1: Reconsider the \"WRN40-2/WRN40-1\" notation in the table, as it is not clear what is the teacher and student.\n- The related works on \"Understand knowledge distillation\" miss references to strong theoretical works from Phuong and Lampert (2019), \"Towards Understanding Knowledge Distillation\", Borup and Andersen (2021), \"Even your Teacher Needs Guidance: Ground-Truth Targets Dampen Regularization Imposed by Self-Distillation\", and Mobahi et al. (2020), \"Self-Distillation Amplifies Regularization in Hilbert Space\".\n- The related works on \"Alleviate \u201cteacher overfitting\u201d.\" lacks reference to Dong (2019), \"Distillation \u2248 Early Stopping?

Notation $\\mathbb{E}$__\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We will change the notation in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Assumption on reusing the training data__\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will explicitly state this assumption in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Assumption on the loss function__\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that we may need mild assumptions on the loss function to let $f(x) = 1(y)$, although most widely used loss functions would satisfy this requirement. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and will update accordingly in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Notation softmax__\n\nHere the softmax should be our modified softmax. Thanks for pointing this out and we will revise accordingly.\n\n\n\n__Q. Assumption on the variance__\n\nWe note that we will need bounded variance here. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we will revise accordingly.\n\n\n**___**\n\n### ***Empirical***\n\n__Q. Compare with early stopping and other regularization methods (Also question 2)__\n\nWe note that properly early stopping the teacher training may indeed be able to achieve student performance comparable to SoTeacher. However, as also mentioned in Line 356 in our paper, it is often difficult to locate the right epoch number for early stopping. Slight deviation from the best epoch number may significantly impair the student's performance. A meticulous search for the best epoch number will induce high computation costs as one may need to conduct full student training for each epoch number. In contrast, SoTeacher can achieve the best student performance even when the teacher fully converges, which will be much more efficient and friendly to use in practice.\n\nFor other popular training or post-training techniques including classic regularizations such as l1 and l2, label smoothing, advanced data augmentation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty learning methods, we have provided a detailed comparison in Appendix F.\n\n\n\n__Q. Clarification of the statement__\n\nHere *\"This demonstrates that our regularizations are not sensitive to hyperparameter selection.\"* refers to the analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity as shown in Figure 2, while *\"It is thus possible to further boost the performance by careful hyperparameter tuning\"* refers to the main result reported in Tables 1 and 2, where we didn't report the best result yielded by the hyperparameter search but instead report the result by a more intuitive hyperparameter selection.\n\n\n\n__Q. Clarification of Figure 2(a)__\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that this figure may need more careful interpretation. Here we generally look at the trend of the curves as the hyperparameter value varies. We will add more grid search points in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Clarification of the argument__\n\nWe would like to clarify that we didn't argue reducing teacher performance can improve student performance in our paper. Instead, our argument is that strong teacher performance does not necessarily improve student performance. Therefore, we may need to tailor the teacher training such that the teacher's soft predictions better approximate the true label distribution. Such a goal does not necessarily imply an inferior teacher.\n\n\n\n__Q. Comparison to an existing method__\n\nWe note that our proposed method is orthogonal to the method proposed by [1], as their method focuses on how to initialize the student networks, while we focus on how to train the teacher model for better student performance.\n\n\n\n__Q. Interpretation of the student fidelity__\n\nWe agree with the reviewer that improved student fidelity does not necessarily imply that the student can better learn from the teacher. We incorporate such analyses as side evidence of the effectiveness of our method. We will modify our statement carefully in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Phenomenon that student is better than teacher (question 1)__\n\nWe note that it is possible that the student performance can exceed the teacher performance significantly in Figure 1. This is because in the distillation experiments here, the true labels are always used for training the student on top of the soft labels given by the teacher, and the student here is sufficiently trained, unlike the teacher that is early stopped. The strong regularization effect brought by an early-stopped teacher may further boost student performance.\n\n\n**___**\n\n### ***Minor***\n\nWe greatly appreciate the reviewer for pointing out these issues and we will revise accordingly per the reviewer's suggestions.\n\n__Reference__\n\n[1] Learning Student-Friendly Teacher Networks for Knowledge Distillation.

The authors show theoretical evidence which suggest that, as long as the feature extractor of the learner model is (i) Lipschitz continuous; (ii) is robust to feature transformations;  the ERM minimizer can approximate the true label distribution. Then, based on their theoretical considerations, the authors propose the \"SoTeacher\"  training method which incorporates Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization into the teacher's training process."

That said, the authors do show that their method is relatively robust to the choice of these hyperparameters.)\n\n\u2014 The role of the teacher as a \"provider of estimates for the unknown Bayes conditional probability distribution\" is a theory for why distillation works that applies well mainly in the context of multi-class classification, and especially in the case where the input is images. (Indeed, there are other explanations for why knowledge distillation works, as it can be seen as a curriculum learning mechanism, a regularization mechanism etc see e.g. [1])\n\nIn that sense, I feel that the author should either make the above more explicit in the text, i.e., explicitly restrict the scope of their claims to multi-classifcation and images, or provide evidence that their technique gives substantial improvements on binary classification tasks in NLP datasets (but even in vision datasets).\n\n\u2014 One of the main reasons why knowledge distillation is such a popular technique, is because the teacher can generate pseudo-labels for new, unlabeled examples, increasing the size of the student's dataset. (This is known as semi-supervised distillation, or distillation with unlabeled examples, see e.g. [2, 3, 4]. ) It seems that the current approach, typically decreases the test-accuracy of the teacher model \u2014\u00a0a fact which typically impairs the student's performance in the semi-supervised setting [3, 4].\n\n\n[1] Understanding and Improving Knowledge Distillation [Tang\u2217, Shivanna, Zhao, Lin, Singh, H.Chi, Jain] \n\n[2] Big self-supervised models are strong semi-supervised learners [Chen, Kornblith, Swersky, Norouzi, Hinton] \n\n[3 ]Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?

Applicability of the theory__\n\nWe note that our theory can be readily applied to binary classification case as binary classification can be viewed as a special case of multi-class classification. This is covered by our theory as we didn't set any assumptions on the dimension of the output prediction.\n\nWe note that for NLP datasets, our theory needs to be slightly modified. Instead of assuming a \"mixture of features\" data model for the vision tasks, we may need a \"bag of words\" data model for the NLP tasks. Other theorems in our theory can be readily adapted as long as the NLP task can be formulated as a multi-class classification problem.\n\n\n\n__Q. Distillation with unlabeled data__\n\nWe note that our proposed method may not necessarily hurt the distillation performance on unlabeled data. The distillation on unlabeled data often works the best if the student learns from the soft predictions of the teacher. In this case, a teacher that can approximate the true label distribution of the unlabeled dataset may be optimal, which may not necessarily coincide with a teacher with the best test accuracy. We thank the reviewer for bringing this and the relevant papers [1, 2, 3, 4] and will include this discussion in the revision.\n\n__Reference__\n\n[1] Understanding and Improving Knowledge Distillation [Tang\u2217, Shivanna, Zhao, Lin, Singh, H.Chi, Jain]\n\n[2] Big self-supervised models are strong semi-supervised learners [Chen, Kornblith, Swersky, Norouzi, Hinton]\n\n[3] Does Knowledge Distillation Really Work?

Dependence on $\\delta$ in Lemma 3.5__\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the great suggestion. The dependence can indeed be improved using advanced concentration inequalities. We will modify the bound accordingly in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Explanation of \"teacher overfitting\" by our theory__\n\nOur theory suggests that the \"teacher overfitting\" phenomenon, namely that a converged teacher leads to worse student performance, may result from unsatisfactory feature extractors that fail to match regularity constraints, especially the transformation-robust condition. We briefly mentioned this as a motivation for our method in Section 4. Per the reviewer's question, we realized that we may need to explain this in a standalone section. We will update accordingly in the revision.\n\n\n\n__Q. Connection between the method and the theory__\n\nWe note that the regularity conditions of the feature extractors are not always satisfied in practice. As mentioned in Section 4, the Lipschitz continuity is probably satisfied in practice. However, the transformation-robustness may not be satisfied in practice, especially when the data is scarce. Therefore, it is important to explicitly enforce such regularity conditions as proposed by our method.\n\n\n\n__Q. Introduction of additional hyperparameters__\n\nWe note that although our method introduced additional hyperparameters, the end performance is not sensitive to their values, as mentioned in Section 5.2.\n\n\n\n__Q. Improvement on ImageNet__\n\nWe agree that on the large dataset, our method doesn't achieve significant performance improvement. This can be partly explained by our theory, as with sufficient training data, the regularity conditions, especially the transformation robustness, can already be satisfied."

It would be great if the paper can have a more comprehensive comparison with other methods that were proposed to solve the same issue, e.g., early stopping. As shown in Figure 1(b), it seems the Standard teacher early stopped after 150 epochs has a pretty decent performance.\n- The Lipschitz and Consistency regularizations are one of the most important contributions of this paper, but the readers need to read Appendix to fully understand how these two regularizations are applied. Considering the length of the Appendix is not very long, I would suggest making them clear in the main paper.\n- In the experiments, it is unclear how the number of epochs impact the results."

Compare with early stopping and other regularization methods__\n\nWe note that properly early stopping the teacher training may indeed be able to achieve student performance comparable to SoTeacher. However, as also mentioned in Line 356 in our paper, it is often difficult to locate the right epoch number for early stopping. Slight deviation from the best epoch number may significantly impair the student's performance. A meticulous search for the best epoch number will induce high computation costs as one may need to **conduct full student training for each epoch number**. In contrast, SoTeacher can achieve the best student performance even when the teacher fully converges, which will be much more efficient and friendly to use in practice.\n\nFor other popular training or post-training techniques including classic regularizations such as l1 and l2, label smoothing, advanced data augmentation, temperature scaling, and uncertainty learning methods, we have provided a detailed comparison in Appendix F.\n\n__Q. Location of the details of the proposed methods__\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We will move the details of the proposed methods into the main paper.\n\n\n\n__Q. Effect of the number of training epochs__\n\nIn this paper, we follow the widely used settings for training the teacher, namely 240 epochs for CIFAR-100 and 90 epochs for ImageNet and Tiny-ImageNet. We will explore alternative training settings in the revision."
