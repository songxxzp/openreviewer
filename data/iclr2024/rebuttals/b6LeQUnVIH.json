(2020) \u2026 combined with the work of Sar-Shalom & Schwartz (2023) ... but does not go beyond systematic benchmarking\n\nWe agree that our approach builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in the original data map paper, and takes inspiration from Sar-Shalom & Schwartz (2023). However, in this paper, we investigate a **distinct and unexplored research question**: to which extent data maps are transferable across different model sizes and pretraining methods. Addressing this question can open up a range of new applications (like our approach), and deepen our understanding of the relationship between model architecture and the importance of specific training data instances. To this end, we systematically examine the transferability of data maps. Our results indicate promising transferability, and we use this finding to improve both robustness and training efficiency by proposing a novel fine-tuning approach: FTFT. \n\n**Moreover, our work differs substantially with Sar-Shalom & Schwartz (2023)** in that 1) Sar-Shalom & Schwartz (2023) adopted a different and less efficient algorithm based on data maps, which increases the complexity of the original data map algorithm, let alone ERM fine-tuning; 2) Sar-Shalom & Schwartz (2023) did not consider or study the implication for efficiency for such transfers. They experimented with two **equally expensive** models and did not go further to study the specific transferability of data maps across different factors."

We will incorporate discussions on curriculum learning and dataset pruning methods within the related work section. However, it's important to note that our research primarily emphasizes robustness against challenging OOD data. Therefore, there is a less direct relationship between these approaches and FTFT. \n\n**Hard-to-learn and example forgettability**: Swayamdipta et al. (2020) observe that training using ambiguous data yields better performance than using hard-to-learn and forgettable instances. We therefore did not compare against these two methods, since FTFT outperforms the original data map method using ambiguous data. However, we recently experimented with two other robustness enhancement training approaches, PoE [1] and JTT [2]: we found that, compared with these two approaches, FTFT achieves comparable or better performance despite using less-than-half of the training budget. See Table 4 in our updated version. \n\n> Evaluations are limited to finetuning of models for language classification -- unclear whether results would generalize to other domains or task settings (e.g. image classification, language generation).\n\nIn this paper, we focus on classification tasks because the data map method was proposed to address text classification robustness. It is particularly relevant to text classification in view of the known susceptibility of language models to spurious correlation and bias. Nevertheless, data maps can be straightforwardly applied to many classification tasks, including image classification, and we hope our work serves to inspire such work in the CV community.\n\nHowever, because the data map method was not developed for generation tasks, it is not straightforward to perform language generation evaluation. Nevertheless, we believe developing generation data maps is a promising direction to look at for future studies. \n\n> Table 4; How is the cost of one \"ELECTRA-Small with ERM\" calculated (i.e. FLOPs, GPU-Hours, power consumption?) Does this account for the cost of finetuning the reference model and scoring the samples DataMap?\n\nWe estimate the cost for training each model by calculating the FLOPs, using https://github.com/sovrasov/flops-counter.pytorch/tree/master. **Our cost estimation for each method considers the training of both reference models and main models**. \n\n>> Why is 33% chosen for the top q% to create the Data Map? What is the distribution of the ambiguous and hard to learn examples? Do the values have a large degree of skewness?\n\nWe use q%=33% to follow the choices of Swayamdipta et al. (2020). In their experiments, they demonstrate that using less ambiguous data will make models less likely to converge; and using more examples will make FTFT less efficient.\n\n[1] Learning from others' mistakes: Avoiding dataset biases without modeling them.

FTFT costs less-than-half of the training budget of ERM considering both phrases of training. \n\n> How does FTFT perform when compared to existing algorithms that aim to improve the OOD performance of trained models? \n\nThank you for pointing this out. We agree it is important to include comparisons with other methods for improving model robustness. However, IRM, DRO, and WiSE-FT work with splits of distributions according to some known data properties (e.g. topics, genres), while data map and FTFT are distribution-agnostic approaches, and can work with any classification dataset without further curation. \n\nHowever, there do exist other distribution-agnostic approaches, e.g. PoE [1] and JTT [2]. Our comparison with these two methods shows that FTFT achieves comparable or better performance despite using less-than-half of the training budget. See Table 4 in our updated version.  \n\n> How sensitive is FTFT to training hyperparameters of the small reference model and the target model? \n\nWe agree that it is important to ensure the robustness of FTFT towards hyper-parameter selections. However, we note that in our experiments we use the default hyper-parameters recommended in the original DeBERTaV3 and ELECTRA papers without further tuning, and we simply tie the hyper-parameters of reference models and main models. We thus expect our results to be a representative demonstration of FTFT. \n\n>  I observed that the core set selected with base models (ELECTRA-base and DeBERTaV3-base) performs better OOD than training with a core set selection from large models. Can the authors provide more insights into the behavior?\n\nThank you for this intriguing question! We suspect that large models fit all data instances well at the early stage of training, making ambiguous data and easy data less distinguishable. We encourage future studies to perform further analysis on the differences between the specific ambiguous data instances identified by reference models with different capabilities. \n\n> There are a number of papers ... For example, [1] dynamically weighs training domains \u2026 train a proxy model to select the right set of data to train the target model. [2, 3]\n\nThank you for the references. We agree that including these papers will strengthen our related work section, and will for sure include these discussions in our next version. \n\n[1] Learning from others' mistakes: Avoiding dataset biases without modeling them.

However, in this paper, we investigate a **distinct and unexplored research question**: to which extent data maps are transferable across different model sizes and pretraining methods. Addressing this question can open up a range of new applications (like our approach), and deepen our understanding of the relationship between model architecture and the importance of specific training data instances. To this end, we systematically examine the transferability of data maps. Our results indicate promising transferability, and we use this finding to improve both robustness and training efficiency by proposing a novel fine-tuning approach: FTFT. \n\n> The result is mixed.\n\nTo study the transferability of data maps, we deliberately also included weak reference models (e.g., TinyBERT) that would more likely result in failed transfers. Including such models allowed us to analyze the conditions for successful transfers. Table 2 highlights the situations where the transfer of data maps from reference models to main models fails. If we only consider the main models that we experimented with in this paper (DeBERTaV3 and ELECTRA of three different sizes), only 1 out of 6 models fail for NLI, and no models fail for HSD. To further investigate such transferability, we further experimented with BERT-Large and RoBERTa-Large as reference models for DeBERTaV3-Large, and our results again suggest good transferability (See Table 1 in our updated version). In our experiments, we show that by choosing smaller reference models we can improve training efficiency by at least 2x, while showing better robustness. \n\nIn Section 4.3 we analyze why very weak reference models lead to failed transfers and offer insights for selecting effective yet efficient reference models. To further validate our findings in Section 4.3, i.e., weak reference models tend to identify easy data as ambiguous data, we have performed the following additional experiment with four models, TinyBERT, ELECTRA-Small, DeBERTaV3-Base, and DeBERTaV3-Large (see Figure 3 in Appendix B). First, for each model, we separate the training dataset of MultiNLI into two groups, the 10% most hard-to-learn data and the remaining (i.e. easier) data. Second, we plot the median value of p_true for each data group. Our results show that for models that fail to transfer their data maps (i.e., ELECTRA-Small and TinyBERT), hard-to-learn data instances have consistent low p_true values across epochs, and consequently receive lower ambiguous scores. In this case, the data instances that are identified as ambiguous are actually the easier ones.  However, for DeBERTaV3-Base/Large, which successfully transfer their data maps, easier data converges at the very beginning of the training process, and thus also receive lower ambiguous scores.  \n\u201cEven in the remaining rows, the result is inconsistent across datasets.\u201d We are not sure which results you are referring to here: compared with the original data map method, we observe comparable or better results in successful transfers. \n\n> Cost saving is only in fine-tuning time rather than inference time. However, for LLMs, fine-tuning cost is much less of an issue than pertaining or inference cost.\n\nAs fine-tuning still outperforms in-context learning in NLP tasks [1], its efficiency and robustness is of great importance. In this work, we simultaneously improve both fine-tuning efficiency and prediction robustness. We believe our work is still of significance to modern NLP research.\n\n\n[1] Few-shot Fine-tuning vs. In-context Learning: A Fair Comparison and Evaluation. Mosbach et al, 2023."
