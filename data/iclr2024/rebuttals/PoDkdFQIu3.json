By defining the shift from a factual state to a counterfactual state under a soft intervention, the counterfactual data can be generated by solving the log-likelihood function as a static state analysis with priors of an \u03c9-dependent Gaussian mixture model. Such a generation method can be used to estimate an ITE and the experimental results of the simulated data show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines in estimating ITE."

                        "value": "Thanks for the careful review that brought out several subtle observations that need clarification. We provide a perspective. We will ensure that we include these to improve the paper.\n\n1.\tEM algorithm.  When the number of mixture components is $K=1$, we can ensure the unique solution of target parameters under rotational and scaling ambiguity (i.e., $\\mathbf{WS} = (\\mathbf{WR})(\\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{S}) = \\mathbf{W'S'}$) that gives a global maximization of the likelihood function. However, a Gaussian mixture model with $K > 1$ is not free of local maxima issues, and EM algorithms only find local optimal solutions of the likelihood function. Our model also does not give the same unique parameters every time it is trained. Normally, however, as we are not too concerned about non-unique solutions from the conventional use of a Gaussian mixture model for density estimation, the authors do not think it is a concerning issue for the generative task. Empirically, we observe that the probability of getting some worse solutions is very low.\n\n2.\tLinear Observers. Our method is a unique algorithm distinguished from the SCM-based framework. SCM (synthetic control method) algorithms do find a convex combination of the control group data to generate a synthetic control. Originally, SCM does not use linear observers like our $\\mathbf{W}^{(t)}$ and does not use a latent representation of data like our state vector representation $\\mathbf{S}$. It is true that SyncTwin uses a latent representation (as shown in Figure 2 of their paper), which makes it look similar to ours, but SyncTwin also finds a convex combination in the latent representation space (as shown by Equation 4 of their paper) like the SCM-based methods. Our method does not solve such a combinatorial problem to generate counterfactuals. Our method is a probabilistic generative model that can randomly generate counterfactuals from the null space (spanned by $\\mathbf{W}_\\perp^{(T_0)}$) to pretreatment observers, which ensures the pretreatment causality restriction.\n\n3.\tLinear and additive intervention. This paper emphasizes the restriction on the counterfactual generation that receiving treatment at a time cannot cause any difference reversely to pretreatment observation data. The restriction is obeyed in this paper by assuming such linear and additive intervention. Because the linear and additive intervention is made only in the null space to pretreatment observers (as shown in Assumption 4 and Definition 2.2), the intervention does not cause any effect on pretreatment observation data. If we decided to use nonlinear observers, we would have to assume a nonlinear intervention to keep the restriction. In a bigger frame, we can consider two equally qualified options: one is that we assume a linear observer system and employ a Gaussian mixture model and the other is that we assume a nonlinear observer system and use a single Gaussian model. This paper takes the first option and, in the first option, the assumption of linear and additive intervention is reasonable."

                        "value": "Thanks for the suggestions on clarifying the assumptions, comparative advantages, and more rigorous theoretical treatment. We provide brief explanations, results, and plans for rigorous treatment.\n\n(1)  In the original synthetic control method and its variant models (e.g., robust synthetic control, SyncTwin, etc.), a synthetic control is defined as a weighted average of the units in the donor pool (control group). The post-treatment values of the weighted average are regarded as the counterfactual prediction of post-treatment outcomes. However, the pre-treatment values of the weighted average are not the same as the observed pretreatment data because the problem of finding the optimal (nonnegative) weights is basically an over-determined linear system of equations or a linear system of equations that has no unique solution due to nonnegativity regularization, and it only finds an approximated solution.\n\nEmpirically, Figure 3 of our paper shows that there are gaps between the black line (factual data) and the blue line (SCM prediction) in the pretreatment periods, which suggests the infringement that the pretreatment predictions (blue line) are also affected reversely by the policy in 1988.\nFurthermore, Figure 4 of the SyncTwin paper also shows the infringement. The authors say:\n\n*\u201cThe individual shown in Figure 4 (top) has a sensible ITE estimate because the synthetic twin matches its pretreatment outcomes closely. In addition to visualization, we can calculate the individualized error bound based on $d_i^y$ (Equation 7).\u201d*\n\nThey say the synthetic twin matches its pretreatment outcomes \"closely\", but our SSA-GMM results \u201cexactly\u201d match any pretreatment outcomes. Figure 2 of the CGP paper (Schulam \\& Saria, 2017) also shows the gaps between the observed pretreatment measurements (green points) and the model prediction (blue curves). Even a very small difference in the pretreatment periods can make a big difference in the post-treatment prediction, and the restriction cannot be ignored. Our contribution to the self-evident constraint is clear and not limited.\n\n(2) Table 1 in our paper is a reproduced one of Table 2 of the SyncTwin paper. Table 1 itself shows our state-of-the-art results across different biases and data sizes. The training/testing dataset used was added by independent white noise $\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.1)$. Our results of a mean absolute error are at the level of 0.07, which means the ideal performance that cannot be algorithmically further improved when we notice\n\n      (numpy.abs(numpy.random.randn(10000000) * 0.1)).mean() = 0.07979.\n\nTables 2 and 3 of our paper also support that our method is robust to data missingness and noises. As requested by the Reviewer, we performed more experiments under diverse treatment times and over prolonged post-treatment durations. Our new tables in **Table A** and **Table B** show the state-of-the-art performance of our method.\n\n(3) This paper could benefit more from a rigorous theoretical exploration against noise, bias, and data missingness. This is a linear framework that enables it to be analyzed theoretically; we can include theoretical analyses in the Appendix and refer to it in the main body of the paper. In the appendix, we will also provide a literature review on those methods, such as MC-NNM and CGP.\n\n(4) To produce ground truth counterfactual pretreatment and post-treatment data in Figure 4, we used the same Pharmacology model [(link)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1472-8206.2006.00404.x) and codes [(link)](https://github.com/ZhaozhiQIAN/SyncTwin-NeurIPS-2021/blob/main/sim/pkpd.py) that SyncTwin used."

                        "value": "Thanks for your insights on the need to provide clarity on the main contribution and perceived weakness. We will definitely address this.\n\nBriefly,  our crucial insight and contribution is that our algorithm assumes the additivity between factual data and counterfactual predictions (by Assumption 4, Definition 2.2, and Definition 2.3) and that counterfactual predictions are made from in the null space (spanned by $\\mathbf{W}_\\perp^{(T_0)}$) to a set of the pretreatment linear observer matrices, which are referred to as a linear algebraic framework in the title. We used the Gaussian mixture model merely as a density estimation method to be able to derive analytic formulas of Equations (13) and (14) that are simple and practical. Such a model can be trained with a small dataset like clinical trial data.\n\nThe Gaussian mixture model is replaceable by any other model as long as it can universally approximate the underlying data distributions. If it is replaced with a deep generative model, a new cross-sectional model is necessary and can be derived like Lemma 2.2.\n\nThe model whose targeted problem and data are closest to ours is SyncTwin. The SyncTwin performance was demonstrated only by LDL cholesterol data, and we used the same dataset to show our state-of-the-art results. IHDP and JOBS datasets do not have time-varying longitudinal outcomes and are not in our target problems, so we did not consider them for comparison. We can compare performance with them with an appropriate reformulation of our algorithm in the Appendix if needed. \n\nOur results in Table 1 were produced using Equation (12) as a random variable because $\\xi$ is a random variable, and $\\text{ITE}_n^{(t)}$ is also a random variable. We repeated generating such random ITEs and numerically calculated their average and standard deviation, which are our results in Table 1. In Figure 3, on the contrary, the red solid line and pink shade are the expected values and standard deviations as calculated using the formulas of Equations (13) and (14)."

                        "value": "We appreciate the suggestion to improve our manuscript to bring out the contribution clearly. The main body of the paper presents a probabilistic model and Appendix D discusses its deterministic model as a matrix factorization problem without a prior distribution of Gaussian mixture. We will organize Appendix D so that readers can understand them clearly. It is page-limited to include Appendix D in the main text, and we will refer to it properly in the main text.\n\nIn the real world, objects change with time, and so does the data. Transforming such time-varying data into a static time-invariant representation leads to a problem that is easier to solve, which is the motivation and foundation of our approach. In that light, Assumptions 1 and 2 provide a new perspective in which the objects\u2019 new representation, denoted by $\\mathbf{S}$, does not change, and the observer's viewpoint, denoted by $\\mathbf{W}$, is changing. Such static representations of $\\mathbf{S}$ that are invariant to time can be learned well with simpler models (such as in this paper, GMM). Assumption 2 describes the relationship between time-invariant data $\\mathbf{S}$ and time-varying data $\\mathbf{X}$. This observation is our main insight, which is then embellished by creating a more realistic model where one can include some additive measurement noise.  We further highlight that the validity of our insight and assumption is established by experimental results that offer a definite improvement over the state of the art."
