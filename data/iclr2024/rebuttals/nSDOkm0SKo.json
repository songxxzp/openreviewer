The paper significantly misses the mark for ICLR standards, displaying a conspicuous absence of the analytical depth and methodological rigor that characterizes scholarly research. Its presentation and investigative approach lack the innovation, thoroughness, and scholarly discourse expected in an academic publication."

Several sections of the paper could benefit from more detailed information, such as specific algorithms used, neural network architecture, and a clearer explanation of the variables included in the model. The broad statements and lack of detailed data or theoretical backing make it difficult to fully assess the validity of the claims.\n\nW2: The paper lacks a comparison with existing models or approaches. This omission makes it challenging to gauge the actual advancement this research proposes.\n\nW3: The paper fails to clearly convey complex procedures, particularly around the data collection and neural network modeling. This lack of clarity could hinder readers' understanding.\n\nW4: The research's basis on a hypothetical situation, rather than real-world data and scenarios, may detract from its applicability and relevance. It creates a simulation-like environment which may not account for all real-world variables and uncertainties, decreasing the robustness of the findings.\n\nW5: The paper lacks a thorough literature review, which is crucial for situating any research within the context of existing knowledge. Additionally, there are very few references (only two!), and those included are not from peer-reviewed sources, which could call into question the research's grounding in established academic discourse."
