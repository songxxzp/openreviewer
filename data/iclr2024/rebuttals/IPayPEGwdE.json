An efficient exploration algorithm called ConvExplore is provided and its corresponding regret is shown, which serves as an upper bound for the proposed problem setting. In addition, a lower bound result is provided, which indicates that the proposed algorithm is tight up to log factors."

In practice, the number of context could be very large, the proposed algorithm is not very practical as it requires a lot of explorations. \n- The causal graph setting in this paper is not new and is very rudimental, i.e., the assumption of the graph for each context, which is similar to the original Lattimore 2016 paper and ignores many recent developments, e.g., Lu 2020, 2021, Adaptively Exploiting d-Separators with Causal Bandits 2022."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for appreciating the novelty of our problem setting and for further highlighting the clarity of the Algorithm. We address some of the reviewer's questions below:\n\n1. The k contexts are not correlated. The contexts represent different users, and each user can have a totally different causal graph and reward function.\n\nA1. In our manuscript, the term 'context' is used in a specific manner, which might not have been evidently clear. It does not refer to a single user, but rather to their demographic. Each demographic may have many users, and as such, the number of contexts is driven by the amount of information an advertiser receives about a user from the platform (which is limited). In practice, each context -- of which there are a finite number -- may contain a large number of users on the platform. Further we note that having correlated contexts may require additional assumptions as to how information is shared between contexts. Once such assumptions are incorporated, our framework is general enough to accomodate such a problem setup. Having said that, correlated contexts is not the problem we are addressing. We are happy to provide additional information or elaboration on this if it would be helpful.\n\n2. The causal graph setting in this paper is not new.\n\nA2. While newer causal graph settings have been considered in Bilodeau et al. (2022) and Lu et al. (2021), our contributions are altogether novel with regard to the decision problem considered. Having said that, we thank the reviewer for pointing us to these references. We will add, \u201cThere have been new lines of work extending the causal graph considered in this setting in Lu et al. (2021), alongside works that consider a d-separation between the intervention and the outcome (Bilodeau et al., 2022).\"\n\n3. Why are stochastic transitions to the contexts difficult?\n\nA3. We address this question in three parts: the difficulty in practice, the difficulty in the setting, and the difficulty in analysis.\n\nFirst, we address the practical difficulty. We note that in practice, it is not possible to request a platform for exactly one type of user that we want. For example, if we request a demographic of new-parents, we may be referred to users who are either high-income or low-income (who both share the attribute of being a new parent). There are various other attributes of users that may or may not be requested and may be assigned to us. Therefore, assuming a deterministic transition to a context is practically infeasible.\n\nSecond, we address the difficulty in the setting. To compare the two settings, we carried out various experiments. We share the results below:\n   1. Plot for regret with lambda in deterministic and nondeterministic settings:\n      [Link to Plot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l3_jhuOS3xz_8LcQAaZhTbDfvNJxktHL/view?usp=sharing)\n   \n   2. Plot for regret with exploration budget in deterministic and nondeterministic settings:\n      [Link to Plot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qi0ns6ZCP4RZP3RCJ8MymDafvGZRFfG3/view?usp=sharing)\n\n   3. Plot for regret with the number of intermediate contexts:\n      [Link to Plot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pJ-Ya3Fhclb0fowOWRY0nS_nb3Gk4y8g/view?usp=sharing)\n\nWe note that in each of these cases, the stochastic cases are harder.\n\nWe provide plots for several other experiments based on reviewer suggestions below, which we will be adding to the manuscript:\n[Additional Experiments](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VMkeenDM797NtsR25_Fnsc3t3yZkuqy1?usp=sharing)\n\nOur anonymous GitHub repo contains the code required to replicate these experiments:\n[causal contextual bandit GitHub repo](https://github.com/adaptiveContextualCausalBandits/aCCB)\n\nThird, we address the difficulty in the analysis of the stochastic problem. Consider only two interventions at the start state, separated by an $\\epsilon$ probability for the transition to a preferred context that has an optimal reward. Separating these two interventions at the start state becomes extremely difficult. The deterministic transitions entirely sidestep these concerns and can directly reach the preferred context. Therefore, the analysis in such a stochastic setting is hard.\n\n---\n\nWe hope the above points clarify the reviewer\u2019s concerns. We are happy to expand on our manuscript based on the reviewer's feedback. Should you find that these revisions meet your expectations, we would kindly request you to consider revising your evaluation score accordingly. We appreciate your time and effort in reviewing our work."

The objective is to identify optimal interventions in the initial state and post-context identification. The study extends previous work from deterministic to stochastic contexts and offers a regret minimization guarantee using a parameter called \u03bb. The research demonstrates that these guarantees are tight for a broad range of instances. Notably, the work employs convex optimization to address the bandit exploration problem and includes experimental validation of the theoretical results."

To compare our algorithm with these baselines, we carried out several new experiments, the results of which we share below.\n\n# Variation of Expected Regret with Exploration Budget\n\n| exploration_budget | UE\t\t\t\t \t | roundrobin_ucb | roundrobin_ts | ucb_over_intervention_pairs | ts_over_intervention_pairs | convex_explorer |\n|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| 100                | 1.0                   | 1.0            | 1.0           | 1.0                         | 1.0                        | 0.87            |\n| 250                | 0.99                  | 0.95           | 0.96          | 1.0                         | 1.0                        | 0.44            |\n| 500                | 0.71                  | 0.54           | 0.97          | 0.99                        | 1.0                        | 0.16            |\n| 1,000              | 0.4                   | 0.32           | 0.96          | 0.79                        | 1.0                        | 0.02            |\n| 2,500              | 0.02                  | 0.1            | 0.96          | 0.2                         | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 5,000              | 0.0                   | 0.04           | 0.94          | 0.13                        | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 7,500              | 0.0                   | 0.01           | 0.96          | 0.1                         | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 10,000             | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.93          | 0.08                        | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 12,500             | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.91          | 0.06                        | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 15,000             | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.93          | 0.06                        | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 20,000             | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.94          | 0.0                         | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 25,000             | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.96          | 0.0                         | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n| 100,000            | 0.0                   | 0.0            | 0.97          | 0.0                         | 1.0                        | 0.0             |\n\n\nFirstly, we note that the uniform exploration algorithm (round robin) performs the best amongst the non-causal algorithms. UCB for choice of intervention at each context, with round-robin over the choice of initial intervention also works quite well, but takes a longer time to converge to the right solution. Thompson sampling based approaches do not work well. The works performing algorithms were those which treated the intervention pairs as a bandit, and tried to optimize over this larger bandit problem (ignoring the information available in the structure of the problem). We share the plot related to this table below:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1qWSt7Kv-sEi85dD4sjflLnQqRC7V_TCN/view?usp=sharing (Note the log scaling over the x-axis).\n\nWe provide plots for several other experiments based on reviewer suggestions below, which we will be adding to the manuscipt:\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VMkeenDM797NtsR25_Fnsc3t3yZkuqy1?usp=sharing\n\nOur anonymous github repo contains the code required to replicate these experiments:\nhttps://github.com/adaptiveContextualCausalBandits/aCCB\n\n\n2. The authors didn't provide a comparison of their regret bound with other related works\nA2. We have added several new baselines to our experimental work presently (cf. our [causal contextual bandit GitHub repo](https://github.com/adaptiveContextualCausalBandits/aCCB)). Many other works are not directly applicable to our model. Due to our setting extending those considered in prior works, we note that they may not be directly applicable here. For example, causal bandit, or causal contextual bandit works are not applicable to causal contextual bandit works with adaptive contexts. \n\nHaving said that, we thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. We will add a paragraph explaining (a) baselines we have compared with and (b) why some of the baselines from other causal bandit works are not applicable."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for several positive comments made on the paper, especially onthe strength of our proof and for indicating that our method is highly suitable for CCBs.\n\n\nWe address the points raised in the 'Weaknesses' and 'Questions' sections below.\n1. 1.From the experimental results, it is observed that the choice of \u03bb significantly influences the algorithm's performance comparison. Could authors provide the variation curve under larger \u03bb values?\nA1. In fact, we note that we have varied lambda up to the largest possible value that it can take theoretically. At the right end, the lambda has been taken to be $nk$, which is the largest value it can possibly take. \n\n2. How should $\\lambda$ be specifically adjusted\nA2 The $\\lambda$ value is based on the instance given to us, and is not an adjustable hyperparameter. It is something intrinsic to the hardness of the problem given to us. In most instances, $\\lambda$ is likely to be low given causal variables do not have $q$ values which are close to 0. \n\n2b. CE's performance is inferior to that of UE. How can this be explained?\nA2b. In the theoretical analysis, we were not utilising the data from the first two parts of the algorithm (where the probability of transition, and causal parameter were being estimated). This is because these parts of the algorithm were only influencing the constants in the regret term. But, in a practical implementation, the data from these parts of the algorithm can also be used to estimate rewards.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for several positive comments made on the paper.\n\n\nWe address the points raised in the 'Weaknesses' and 'Questions' sections below.\n\n1. Restricting to binary interventions and rewards (i.e., either 0 or 1) makes the problem easier to solve but limits the practical applications to problems with only binary interventions and rewards.\n\nA1. The binary intervention setting is not really restrictive  as the setting is general enough to capture all finite alphabets (over the variables). We will clarify this point further in the manuscript.\n\n2. The possible number of contexts can be very large (or even infinite), e.g., the number of users on the platform. Therefore, working with matrix P (where the number of columns is the same as the number of contexts) may be computationally challenging.\nA2. A contextual bandit setting need not hold one context per unit or per user in the system. Often, one may find many users pertain to the same context. For example, if one assume a combination of user-device and user-demographic to be a context, then not only is the number of contexts small, but further, the number of users per context may also be large. Crucially, irrespective of the number of contexts, we perform better than alternatives algorithms for this setting where regret is upper bounded by $\\sqrt{nk/T}$ for n contexts and k interventions per context. Our regret is upper bounded by $\\sqrt{\\lambda/T}$ where $\\lambda \\ll nk$.\n\n3. The proposed algorithm is horizon-dependent as it needs to know the total number of rounds, T, upfront.\nA3. Yes indeed. This is a standard assumption in the simple regret setting. These settings are applicable in domains where there is some budget given for exploring, in which time the near-optimal solution has to be found. For example, in medical domains, a certain number of exploratory tests are allowed after which the best variant of a drug has to be found. In the advertising domain, marketers often look at A/B tests where there is a certain budget for exploration after the marketer makes their decision on the best arm/intervention.\n\n4. Page 1, last paragraph: what are the other variables in this statement, \"they get to observe the values of multiple other variables in the causal graph.\"?\nA4. Since variables in a causal graph are causally linked as in a causal bayesian network (CBN), by intervening on one variable in the graph, the values of other variables may be inferred. Specifically, by doing the do-nothing intervention, one may observe the values of multiple variables in the causal graph as well as the reward variable. Thereby a causal intervention is more potent than an arm-pull in a multi-armed bandit setting. \n\n5. Is there any relationship between $\\lambda$ and effective dimension if the problem is modeled as a sparse bandit problem?\nA5. Indeed there is! As the reviewer has observed the causal parameter $\\lambda$ is dependent on various features of the problem, including the number of contexts, and the causal threshold parameter $m$ at each context. Having said that, in our understanding, the modelling of the problem as a sparse bandit may not help. \n\nTo experimentally verify this, we carried out an experiment where we compare our model (convex_explorer) with two baseline models (ucb_over_intervention_pairs,ts_over_intervention_pairs) which treat the problem as a large bandit problem. These models treat the pair of interventions at the start state, and at the intermediate context -- which may be thought of as the (user_demographic, advertisement_choice) pair -- as a large bandit problem. We note that such a formulation leads to sub-optimal regret as seen in the figure here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YydC2e_NkCBWEp-IAPB0EXNPPzvwt3mU/view?usp=sharing\n\nWe propose that such sub-optimal regret is because the information regarding the context is not shared, and hence the regret is high."
