The authors introduce CLaM-TTS, which uses probabilistic residual vector quantization for two main benefits: it significantly compresses token length and enables the generation of multiple tokens simultaneously, eliminating the need for cascaded modeling. Experimental results show that CLaM-TTS performs on par with or better than existing zero-shot TTS baselines in terms of naturalness, intelligibility, speaker similarity, and inference speed. The study also explores how the pretraining extent of language models and their text tokenization strategies affect performance."

All the training details are meticulously presented, contributing to the paper's clarity and ease of comprehension.\n\n- While the paper adheres to the conventional structure of token + language modeling (LM), the introduction of the CLaM approach marks a significant innovation. CLaM addresses two critical issues in the field, demonstrating sufficient novelty and contributing meaningfully to the existing body of research.\n\n- The experiments conducted are comprehensive, effectively demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed methods. The completeness of these experiments lends credibility to the findings and supports the conclusions drawn in the paper.\n\n- In terms of RTF, the CLaM-TTS model exhibits superior speed compared to the Voicebox and Vall-E TTS models. This enhanced performance highlights the advantages of the proposed approach."

The experimental results demonstrate a trade-off: *reducing the code emitting frequency degrades audio quality while increasing it diminishes language modeling performance*. We also reported on the inference speed of the entire system in relation to varying code frequencies. This finding illustrates that our main model operates at a balance point within this trade-off, efficiently managing both aspects."

The semantic tokens in AudioLM are a sequence of 50Hz, while our tokens consist of 32 sequences of 10Hz due to the use of 32-depth residual vector quantization. This means that when representing audio, we can achieve a higher \"length\" compression rate compared to AudioLM by compressing the audio into multiple sequences using RVQ. We have conducted experiments and evaluations regarding the codeword emitting frequency, which we addressed in the first section of \u201cGeneral Response to AC and Reviewer\u201d. These results demonstrate that our main model operates in the sweet spot for the trade-off. We sincerely request you to review them for additional context.\n\n> `Definitions of $y$ and $\\hat{y}$` \n\nFor the definitions of the variables, please refer to the second paragraph in Sec. 3.2.1. $y$ and $\\hat{y}$ denote a mel-spectrogram and its reconstruction from the decoder, respectively."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for providing constructive feedback and spotting unclear points.\n\n> `Contribution of this paper`\n\nTo address the reviewer's concerns and clarify our methodology, we emphasize the distinctions between our approach and similar existing generative methodologies, VQGAN and RQ-Transformer, among generative models such as VAE and latent diffusion.\n\n1. **Introduction and utilization of probabilistic residual vector quantization**: This feature not only enhances codebook usage to improve reconstruction quality but also offers a principled approach to generate residual codes from latent language modeling within a variational framework.\n2. **Employing a single autoregressive transformer**:  Our method proposes a process where a single autoregressive transformer can generate $N$ tokens at each decoding step by utilizing the probabilistic modeling of the residual vector quantizer, without the need for depth-transformers or non-autoregressive (NAR) transformer decoders. Our method shares similarities with VQGAN in that both involve 1) autoencoding of input data using VQVAE and 2) generation of the quantized latent representation using an autoregressive transformer. However, the vector quantizer in VQGAN employs plain vector quantization, producing a sequence of tokens, thereby enabling the transformer to model the discrete sequence with a softmax output. In contrast, RQ-Transformer and neural audio codec language models, which use $N$-depth residual vector quantization, produce $N$ sequences of tokens. This results in the need for not only an autoregressive transformer to decode along the time axis but also an additional depth-transformer to model $N$ tokens along the depth axis or a NAR transformer decoder to generate a token sequence at each decoding step.\n\n\n> `Regarding the performance of the proposed method` \n\nThank you for your constructive criticism, which highlights the weaknesses in our research. We are truly grateful for your thorough review. \n\nWe acknowledge the observed performance gap of our method compared to Voicebox, particularly in cross-sentence tasks where models are required to generate outputs from discontinuous texts and partially truncated audio prompts. To address this issue, we have empirically analyzed the performance improvements when incorporating phonemes as inputs (as done in VALL-E, Voicebox, and SPEAR-TTS) and durations (as in Voicebox and YourTTS) into our model. We also discuss methods that directly train on cross-sentence tasks, such as those employed by SPEAR-TTS. These investigations are critical in understanding the reasons behind our model's performance drop in cross-sentence tasks compared to other models. In response to the concerns you raised, we have provided detailed explanations in the second section of our \u201cGeneral Response to AC and Reviewer\u201d.\n\nNonetheless, it is important to emphasize why our approach uniquely relies on plain text input, unlike other approaches. This is due to our model's ability to seamlessly integrate a pre-trained large language model, which is trained on a diverse array of texts and tasks. This integration allows us to achieve performance comparable to other baselines that employ more complex modeling.\n\nMoreover, as per your great suggestion, we have included samples from other competitive models (VALL-E, NaturalSpeech 2, and Mega-TTS) on our demo page for comparison. These samples were taken from each model's demo pages. We note that the small number of these additional samples is due to the lack of official codes or pre-trained models. We acknowledge that the performance analysis using this limited number of additional samples may not have statistical significance. Nevertheless, we kindly request the reviewer to consider these additional samples in their evaluation.\n\ndemo page: https://clam-tts-mos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/demo/index.html"

To do so, authors propose training a Mel-VAE model that predicts several \"RQ\" codes at once. Once this part of the network is trained, the authors propose to train latent language model with a gaussian mixture based decoder that attempt to sample codes that would match the ground truth. The codes are then passed through a decoder which outputs mel spectrograms. The paper shows that this approach can yield good performance comparable to SOTA methods on continuations and cross-sentence speech generation."

We are truly grateful for your thorough review.

This integration allows us to achieve performance comparable to other baselines that employ more complex modeling.\n\n\n> `Clarification of the descriptions`\n\nThank you for pointing out the parts of our paper where the explanation was insufficient. We are grateful for your detailed feedback. In our work, the latent language model produces three distinct outputs, representing 1) the mixture weights, 2) the means of the mixture of Gaussian distribution, and 3) the probability of ending the generation. Initially, we described these three components collectively as \u201cparallel predictors\u201d. However, in light of your feedback, we have replaced this term in the text with the aforementioned description. Furthermore, we elucidate the decoding step in which multiple tokens are generated from the output mixture of Gaussians (MoG) distribution, consisting of the mixture weights and the means. During each decoding step, a latent vector sampled from this distribution is transformed into latent codes through the residual vector quantizer of Mel-VAE. The autoregressive decoding step concludes when the probability of ending the generation reaches or exceeds 0.5.\n\n\n> `Missing references & typos`\n\nIn response to your feedback, we have added the missing reference and corrected typos, as well as other areas requiring revision, in the updated version of the paper.\n\n> `Ablation study regarding the frequency` \n\nTo address the critical concern you raised, we conducted an ablation study to analyze the impact of varying codeword rates in the proposed system and addressed it in the \u201cGeneral Response to AC and Reviewer\u201d. The experimental results demonstrate a trade-off: reducing the code emitting frequency degrades audio quality while increasing it diminishes language modeling performance. This finding illustrates that our main model operates at a balance point in this trade-off. We sincerely request you to review them for additional context.\n\n> `Using mel-spectrogram for the desired compression`\n\n Our choice to use mel-spectrograms instead of raw waveforms as the input for the VAE is driven by a practical consideration. It requires substantially more memory and trainable parameters to train VAE with raw waveforms due to the extended input length. In contrast, using mel-spectrograms allows us to train VAE with considerably fewer resources as well as to use an off-the-shelf vocoder to convert mel-spectrograms to raw waveforms. Nonetheless, as the reviewer pointed out, pursuing higher reconstructed audio quality with the desired compression in an end-to-end manner with raw waveforms can be a promising direction for future work."

CLaM-TTS combines several ideas from the literature into a single model trained on several large-scale datasets and demonstrates high-quality speech generation. The input to this model is text and the output is mel spectrograms, which must then be converted to audio waveforms using a vocoder.\n\nThe model consists of the following components:\n\n1. Audio quantizer: They introduce Mel-VAE, a model for encoding mel spectrograms into a sequence of multi-dimensional discrete codes. The Mel-VAE decoder is used to convert the discrete codes back into mel spectrograms during inference.\n2. Autoregressive synthesis network: A conditional language model is used to convert text into discrete codes. The language model is conditioned upon text (encoded by a pretrained network) and autoregressively predicts discrete audio codes. \n\nThe audio quantizer is based on residual vector quantization (RVQ). Unlike traditional language models which use a softmax output layer to predict discrete codes, the CLaM-TTS synthesis network instead uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in order to predict a continuous output, which is then converted into a discretized output using the Mel-VAE RVQ quantizer.\n\nThis system is then trained on 100k hours in multiple languages and evaluated on a number of metrics, including speaker similarity, MOS, and ASR-based intelligibility and WER, demonstrating competitive performance."

While our method seamlessly generates from coarse to fine-grained tokens without the necessity for a two-stage pipeline, we do not believe that modeling our approach as a two-stage system would inherently degrade its performances. We want to clarify that, in this work, we provide a method that efficiently addresses the complex modeling challenges inherent in text-to-speech synthesis systems at scale. Our proposed probabilistic residual vector quantization not only enhances the reconstruction of audio quality but also offers a principled way to generate multiple codes within a variational inference framework. This approach effectively allows for large-scale text-to-speech synthesis without adding modeling complexities or compromising inference speed.\n\n> `scaling up dataset and model sizes`\n\nThank you for highlighting the importance of conducting additional experiments to substantiate our claims. We have carried out an ablation study. Following your recommendation, we will incorporate these results into the revised manuscript.\n\n**Scaling up dataset size**: The results in the below table show that the performance of our model improves with an increase in the volume of training data. Specifically, we trained ByT5-base models on different sizes of training datasets: 1. (*small dataset*) 50% of the MLS English subset; 2. (*normal dataset*) the full MLS English subset; and 3. (*large dataset*) a comprehensive English dataset that includes MLS English subset, Gigaspeech, LibriTTS-R, VCTK, and LJSpeech. We observed a noticeable degradation in performances (WER, CER, and speaker similarity) when the small dataset was employed. Conversely, training on the large dataset resulted in a performance enhancement in speaker similarity while maintaining WER and CER compared to the model trained on the normal dataset. This evidence strongly indicates that scaling up training data can significantly boost our model's performance.\n\n| Dataset | WER | CER | SIM-o |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| small (22K hr)  | 3.06     | 1.15| 0.3851|\n| normal (44K hr) | 2.79     | 1.00| 0.3879|\n| large (55K hr) | 2.79     | 0.98| 0.4001|\n\n**Scaling up model size**: Due to time constraints, we were unable to train ByT5-base model on the large dataset with as many steps as the trained ByT5-large model. Consequently, a precise comparison is challenging at this stage, but we share the current results. We will include the experimental results in the revised manuscript as soon as they become available. \n| Model size | WER | CER | SIM-o |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| ByT5-base      | 2.79     | 0.98| 0.4001|\n| ByT5-large     | 2.36     | 0.79| 0.4767|"
