It proposes a method that fine-tunes pre-trained generative models using reinforcement learning, with a novel automated metric that measures consensus as a reward signal. This metric correlates strongly with commonly used metrics like FID and demonstrates greater robustness to variations in the number of images. Experiments show that by applying this method, the performance of image generation models improves across various benchmarks."

For example, in Table 3, how does the number support your approach?\n\n3. Many relevant works that tried to address the issue of FID have been proposed, and they should be included in the discussion also.\n\nThus, the readability is pretty bad.

Thereby, a generated and a reference image are embedded using a VQ-VAE image tokenizer and the embedding sequences are treated similar as language tokens in CIDEr: generated and reference n-grams are counted and compared. In order to use the score as a loss in training generative models, the authors rely on reinforcement learning. The paper studies how the proposed score behaves under synthetic perturbations including additive noise and image distortions. The score is further applied to improve the quality of diffusion/consistency models on LSUN (256px) and ImageNet (64px)."

In that sense the paper aims to tackle a highly relevant research problem."

                    "value": "Unfortunately, the paper makes a rather unpolished impression (see minor issues below), but also has some larger issues.\n\n- Most importantly, the metric relies on a reference image for every generated image. This makes it unsuitable for unconditional generation, so it is unclear how the metric is applied to the LSUN bedroom data set (please clarify). For class-conditional ImagNet, one could use the images per class, but I\u2019m not sure if the metric could handle the necessary diversity. Either way, details are missing on how the score is computed for the different data sets.\n- According to Section 3.1 each image is mapped to 2x2 tokens. This sounds like a very low number, and the VQ-VAE would need to be extremely compressive to map a 256px image. I doubt it could meaningfully capture a lot of visual detail necessary for a good assessment of visual quality.\n- According to Figure 1, the proposed \u201cCIGE exhibits a strong correlation with FID\u201d. This is clearly not true if the legend of that figure is correct. Further, I would expect a good visual score to capture the visual difference between FID of 100 and 30, which is quite substantial for a human.\n- It seems the proposed method is not effective, despite claimed in the text: In Table 3 the FID and Inception score are almost identical with and without the proposed method/RL.\n\n\nMinor issues:\n- There are quite a few typos: For the first page: \u201ctraining objects\u201d -> \u201ctraining objectives\u201d, \u201clossand\u201d -> \u201closs and\u201d, \u201cparticuler\u201d -> \u201cparticular\u201d \n- Notation collision for symbols in Section 3.1: g used for generated image, quantity in Eq. (1); n used for sequence length and as a superscript/exponent.\n- Inception score is repeatedly computed on LSUN Bedrooms, even though it is not well suited for data other than imagenet.\n- Discussion and references on Precision/Recall (Sajjadi et al. 2018) is missing from related work."
