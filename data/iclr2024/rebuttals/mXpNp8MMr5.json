                    "value": "This work described the problem of hypocritical examples which added tiny perturbations to clean test inputs to increase the targeted model's performance. These samples can mislead machine learning practitioners into assuming that their machine learning models are good enough to be applied in the real world. The authors also mentioned that these samples can be crafted from adversarial examples to provide a false sense of adversarial robustness. They called this two-faced attack and provided its problem formulation and algorithm to create such an attack. They proposed a countermeasure by increasing the perturbation bound of adversarial training to get the best tradeoff between adversarial risk and two-faced risk. After that, they showed a bunch of experiment with several datasets."

Our point-by-point responses to the reviewer's mentioned questions (Q) and weaknesses (W) are provided as follows.\n\n**Q1: In Appendix A, I do not know how you derive from E[1(f(x'') = y) * 1(f(x_{adv} \\neq y)] to E[1(f_{adv} \\neq y)] * E[1(f(x'') = y)]. It is in the lines 7 and 8 if you count the line R_{rhpy}(f,D) as line 1.**\n\nThanks so much for raising this point, which helped us identify an oversight in our derivation process and avoid the omission of a component in the final result. Fortunately, this has no impact on our conclusions. We have made corrections and uploaded the revised version. Thanks again for the reviewer's carefulness!\n\n**W1: The background and motivation are not convincing to me.**\n\nWe have further enriched our background and motivation, and highlighted these changes in the introduction section of the paper. These can be summarized as follows.\n\nDue to the high probability of failures of model deployment in practical applications, it is necessary for practitioners to conduct pre-deployment verification and post-deployment long-term verification to enhance the success rate of deployment [1], especially in safety-critical tasks. Therefore, this work explores the existence of verification-time threats that hypocritically fool the robustly trained models by slightly perturbing the verification data.\n\n[1] Andrei Paleyes, Raoul-Gabriel Urma, and Neil D.

The authors may need to add more experiments for it.**\n\nThanks for the suggestion.

The authors may focus more on the countermeasure.**\n\nAs you mentioned, the previous work (Tao, 2022b) focused on **accuracy**, while our work focuses on **robustness** during the verification phase. Hence there is a clear difference, which makes them two entirely different tasks. Our contributions to the task of two-faced attacks are completely new. In addition, we have made some new findings regarding two-faced attacks: \n\n1) Models with different architectures and adversarial training methods are susceptible to two-faced attacks, leading to falsely elevated verification robustness; \n2) Models with higher adversarial robustness tend to be more vulnerable to two-faced attacks. \n\nTherefore, two-faced attacks are pervasive and tricky, and cannot be simply ignored.\n\nIn terms of countermeasures, we have included more experimental results: \n1) Experimental results of PGD-AT with different budgets under $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm on CIFAR-100; \n2) Experimental results of THRM with different $\\lambda$ under $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm on CIFAR-10; \n3) Experimental results of THRM with different $\\lambda$ under $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm on CIFAR-100. \n\nWe presented the relevant results in W2 and have added them to the appendix of the paper.\n\nWe hope that our responses and the updated experiments have addressed your concerns.

Our point-by-point responses to the reviewer's mentioned questions (Q) and weaknesses (W) are provided as follows.\n\n**Q1: Can the authors provide a real-world example that the two-faced attacks can be applied into?**\n\nAccording to the statistics in practical deployment [1], 85\\% of attempted deployments ultimately fail to achieve the intended results in the production environment. Validation is one of the keys to a successful deployment [2]. A practical real-world example is computer virus detection. There is a possibility that the collected verification data used to validate the virus detection software has been already influenced by attackers using two-faced attacks, which would lead to falsely elevated verification results. In this case, the deployment of such a virus detection software may result in serious consequences.\n\n[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20220707220351/https://www.decisioniq.com/blog/ai-project-failure-rates-are-high\n\n[2] Andrei Paleyes, Raoul-Gabriel Urma, and Neil D. Lawrence. Challenges in deploying machine learning: A survey of case studies. ACM Computer Survey, 55(6), 2022.\n\n**Q2: Can the authors provide more potential countermeasures against two-faced attacks, apart from the ones mentioned in Section 3.3?**\n\nIn the submission, the main focus is on revealing the threat of two-faced attacks for the first time, while a mitigation strategy by increasing the defense budget was presented.\nIn addition, we experiment with THRM [1] as another mitigation strategy. Specifically, we train ResNet-18 with THRM using different $\\lambda$ under the $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm and $\\epsilon=8/255$ on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The experimental results are as follows:\n1) The experiment of THRM with different $\\lambda$ under $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm and $\\epsilon=8/255$ against two-faced attacks on CIFAR-10:\n\n| $\\lambda$ | Clean |   $\\ $ TF    | $R_{\\text{nat}}(f_{\\theta}, D)$ | $R_{\\text{adv}}(f_{\\theta}, D^{+})$ | $R_{\\text{tf}}(f_{\\theta}, D^{\\text{cnr}})$ |\n| ------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :--------: |\n| 1    | 4.53  | 39.55 | 5.56  | 95.20 | 38.95 |\n| 5    | 23.87 | 75.54 | 8.75  | 73.84 | 76.68 |\n| 10   | 32.75 | 79.5  | 11.83 | 62.85 | 84.35 |\n| 20   | 35.85 | 73.14 | 9.79  | 60.25 | 68.59 |\n| 40   | 43.22 | 76.03 | 20.59 | 45.57 | 90.66 |\n| 60   | 43.66 | 73.02 | 24.56 | 42.12 | 92.38 |\n| 80   | 41.92 | 71.98 | 25.22 | 43.94 | 91.47 |\n| 100  | 43.9  | 69.51 | 29.08 | 38.09 | 94.78 |\n\n2) The experiment of THRM with different $\\lambda$ under $\\ell_{\\infty}$ norm and $\\epsilon=8/255$ against two-faced attacks on CIFAR-100:\n\n| $\\lambda$ | Clean |   $\\ $ TF    | $R_{\\text{nat}}(f_{\\theta}, D)$ | $R_{\\text{adv}}(f_{\\theta}, D^{+})$ | $R_{\\text{tf}}(f_{\\theta}, D^{\\text{cnr}})$ |\n| ------- | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :--------: |\n| 1    | 8.15 | 47.96 | 23.27 | 89.38 | 58.05 |\n| 5    | 13.53 | 56.46 | 25.07  | 81.94 | 69.92 |\n| 10   | 20.75 | 55.10 | 28.09 | 71.14 | 67.14 |\n| 20   | 24.95 | 52.75 | 31.58 | 63.53 | 63.95 |\n| 40   | 26.13 | 50.66 | 34.86 | 59.89 | 62.88 |\n| 60   | 26.51 | 49.56 | 36.99 | 57.93 | 63.15 |\n| 80   | 25.91 | 47.09 | 38.70 | 57.73 | 59.85 |\n| 100  | 25.98 | 46.16 | 39.51 | 57.05 | 58.48 |\n\nIt can be seen from the above experimental results that the aforementioned strategies partially mitigate the risk of two-faced attacks, but such a risk remains significant and cannot be ignored. We have updated these experimental results in the appendix.\n\nFurthermore, we can incorporate our two-faced examples (derived from the two-faced risk) into existing adversarial training frameworks, such as TRADES and MART. In these frameworks, KL divergence is used to measure the difference in the output distributions between clean and adversarial examples. We can simply replace the adversarial examples in the KL loss term with our two-faced examples.\n\nHowever, because of the iterative generation of two-faced examples in a bi-level optimization formulation, the whole optimization process (i.e., alternately generating two-faced examples and conducting adversarial training) is highly time-consuming. Hence, we did not adopt this countermeasure. We will explore potential methods to improve the optimization efficiency for incorporating our generation of two-faced examples into existing adversarial training frameworks, in future work.\n\n[1] Lue Tao, Lei Feng, Jinfeng Yi, and Songcan Chen.

Additionally, considering the need for long-term monitoring and updates during the extended deployment of models, two-faced attacks could be applicable in this phase as well.

                        "value": "Thanks for the valuable and encouraging comments! We are so grateful to see that our carefully prepared work can be recognized by the reviewer. Our point-by-point responses to the reviewer's mentioned questions (Q) and weaknesses (W) are provided as follows.\n\n**Q1: Is it possible to include the idea of two-faced risk into current adversarial training frameworks without making major changes?**\n\nYes, we can incorporate our two-faced examples (derived from the two-faced risk) into existing adversarial training frameworks, such as TRADES and MART. In these algorithms, KL divergence is used to measure the difference in output distributions between clean and adversarial examples. We can simply replace the adversarial examples in the KL divergence term with our two-faced examples.\n\nHowever, because of the iterative generation of two-faced examples in a bi-level optimization formulation, the whole optimization process (i.e., alternately generating two-faced examples and conducting adversarial training) is highly time-consuming. Hence, we did not adopt this countermeasure. We will explore potential methods to improve the optimization efficiency for incorporating our generation of two-faced examples into existing adversarial training frameworks, in future work.\n\n**Q2: How can long-term model validation procedures be affected by the future evolution of two-faced attacks?**\n\nIf the attacker persists in conducting two-faced attacks, the long-term model verification procedures may also exhibit falsely elevated performance. Since long-term validation and model updates are challenging and time-consuming, researchers may not update their models if they observe falsely elevated validation metrics for a long time, opting instead to continue deploying a potentially problematic model. This could ultimately lead to a cascade of security issues. This is also why we emphasize in the paper not to overly trust these validation results.\n\n**W1: Though interesting, its theoretical investigation of two-faced risk may prove difficult to implement in real-world scenarios.**\n\nWe would like to clarify that, for applications in the real digital world, our two-faced attacks are easily applicable. As long as researchers collect verification data from the online world, there is a risk of being vulnerable to two-faced attacks. For applications in the physical world, e.g., autonomous driving, two-faced attacks are feasible by combining them with techniques such as adversarial patches. Overall, two-faced attacks are a real threat to AI if adversaries are aware of where the validation data is collected.\n\nContinue by the next post."

The primary research objective of this paper is to uncover the threats posed by two-faced attacks, but it is undeniable that other significant security issues should not be overlooked. Balancing the risks associated with two-faced attacks and other security concerns is indeed a topic worthy of in-depth exploration. For instance, integrating the two-faced risk into existing adversarial training frameworks merits thorough investigation. However, as discussed in the response to Q1, the resulting optimization process (i.e., alternately generating two-faced examples and conducting adversarial training) is highly time-consuming, especially given vast training data. Therefore, there is a need for efficiency optimization to address this issue. \n\n**W4: A lack of clarity in the procedures for experiments may make them difficult to repeat and inhibit future studies.**\n\nThanks for raising this concern. We have provided more information in the experimental procedure section in Appendix B and have uploaded the revised version.\n\n**W5: There can be a gap in comprehensive risk management techniques if the paper does not include a comprehensive explanation of how to balance adversarial risks, such as two-faced risk, against other risks.**\n\nWe agree with the reviewer's feedback. The issue of balancing these risks is indeed worth investigating. While our primary focus in this paper is to uncover the threats posed by two-faced attacks, we presented a preliminary exploration of the trade-off between adversarial risk and two-faced risk in Figure 3 of the submission. As mentioned in the response to Q1, the resulting optimization process is computationally inefficient. Hence, we plan to delve into these challenges in future work, and we anticipate that the reviewer understands the complexities involved.\n\nWe hope that our responses can satisfactorily address your concerns. Thank you again for your time to provide us with valuable feedback."
