For example, compare Section 3 to the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005):\n\n* Lemma 1 is equivalent to Equations 4.9 to 4.12 in the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005) (in fact, the \"proof\" in Appendix B.1, introduced as a \"key theoretical result\" by Appendix B, is an almost verbatim reproduction of Section 4.1 in the mentioned paper but without marking this reproduction as such).\n* Theorem 1 is a version of Theorem 4.2 by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005); Theorem 2 is a version of Theorem 4.3 by Hochbruck and Osterman (2005).\n* Proposition 1 paraphrases Theorem 4.7 by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005).\n* The second-order Butcher tableaus in Table 3 are Tables 5.3 and 5.4, and the third-order tableaus are Table 5.9 (RES) in the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005).\n* The observation that the algorithm which the submission called RES outperforms the DPM-solver++ has also been made (and mathematically underpinned) by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005; Figure 6.3).\n\nSee also the survey article by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2010) and the references cited by both works.\n\n\nIn my view, the fact that the analysis already exists reduces the paper's contribution to a point where it should be rejected.\nAdditionally, I find it problematic that the analysis is presented as new instead of attributing the results to the original works, even though the authors seem to be familiar with the paper by Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005) (the submission cites it on page 18).\n\n**References:**\n\nHochbruck and Ostermann: Explicit Exponential Runge-Kutta Methods for Semilinear Parabolic Problems.

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed review and thoughtful feedback. Below we address specific questions.\n\n## Q1. suggested reference and contributions of our work\nIndeed, our work draws upon well-established theories and analyses from the numerical literature. However, our application of these mathematical tools to diffusion model sampling involves significant efforts and contributions. To the best of our knowledge, these are presented explicitly for the first time in the context of accelerating diffusion models:\n1. We revisit existing, popular diffusion ODE parameterizations and explicitly detail the transformations that convert probability flow ODEs into canonical semi-linear ODE forms. This includes models for both noise prediction and data prediction.\n2. Building upon these connections, we utilize analyses and mathematical tools from exponential integrators to conduct error analysis and design superior numerical algorithms.\n3. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our new algorithm, which fully incorporates stratified order conditions, outperforms existing methods in diffusion sampling. The advantage is more obvious when time scheduling is not optimal, see figure 2. Those experiments highlight the importance of designing order-stratified methods. \n4. Furthermore, extensions based on order-stratified numerical schemes, including both stochastic and multistep methods, also demonstrate superior performance over current methodologies.\n\n## Q2. analysis is presented as new instead of attributing to the original works. \n\n* Firstly, we acknowledge that key mathematical analysis tools in our study are based on well-established theories in the numerical methods literature. We have updated our revision to emphasize this point more clearly.\n* Secondly, the application of these numerical solvers to diffusion models represents a novel approach. For instance, the utilization of order-satisfying techniques plays a crucial role in accelerating diffusion sampling. Unlike existing works that rely on sophisticated and varied derivations, such as those found in DPM-Solver methods, our approach directly leverages conclusions and numerical methods from the numerical literature. This provides a more unified and mathematically robust explanation and framework."

I am happy to see the references to Hochbruck and Ostermann (2005a) and others and acknowledge the other replies to my assessment.\n\nWith the updated version, my concerns are less severe than with the original version; nevertheless, my score remains the same for two reasons:\n\n1. The main issue - that the theoretical derivation of order conditions is discussed as being at the centre of this paper - persists. The abstract and introduction need a clear revision, and the introduced \"refined exponential solver\" remains a known method.\nAll of these are doable but extensive changes, but I think such a revision is too comprehensive to conduct without resubmitting the manuscript elsewhere. \n\n2. As soon as one excludes the theory about the order conditions from the contributions, the remaining ones are too incremental: proposing a different parametrisation of the flow ODE and using a known, \"better\" exponential integrator (in the sense of order conditions) to solve it would require broader empirical studies than in the paper to be valuable to the ICLR community. (Or, at the very least, the derivations in Section 3.2f could be exchanged with the additional experiments in Appendix F). \n\n\nIn both 1. and 2., too much of this paper would need to be rewritten.\nTherefore, I maintain my original assessment that this paper should be rejected. Still, I acknowledge the authors' work put into the rebuttals and updating the paper."

As soon as one excludes the theory about the order conditions from the contributions, the remaining ones are too incremental**\n\nThe central contribution of our paper is the acceleration of the diffusion sampling algorithm, which is built upon a well-established, order-satisfied numerical scheme. We acknowledge that our analysis framework, grounded in the referenced mathematical numeric analysis, may have limited contribution and novelty from the perspective of numerical analysis. However, we emphasize our significant contributions to the field of diffusion models, especially in accelerating visual content generation.\nNotably, our work introduces high-order, order-satisfied diffusion sampling algorithms, previously nonexistent in this domain. We respectfully disagree with the reviewer\u2019s perspective that pointing out prevalent flaws in popular, but order-unsatisfied methods and achieving state-of-the-art diffusion sampling performance is trivial.\nWe hope the reviewer can value our contribution to the accelerating diffusion model. Celebrated works such as DDIM and DPM-Solver, while adopting different ways of presenting proposed algorithms, essentially represent special cases that utilize the suboptimal Runge-Kutta tables found in the existing EI literature. Our work situates algorithm development within a more mathematically rigorous framework and conducts a broader range of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\n**Q2: broader empirical studies than in the paper to be valuable to the ICLR community**\n\nWe believe that our experiments are comprehensive and robust, encompassing a wide range of tests including single-step and multi-step experiments, deterministic and stochastic cases, diffusion models based on labeled and test prompts, and both classifier-based and classifier-free guidance settings. We maintain that our empirical studies are sufficiently broad and valuable to the ICLR community.\n\n**Q3: writing suggestions. abs and introduction. exchange section 3.2 and Appendix F**\n\nWe have revised the abstract and introduction to clarify potential misunderstandings.\nRegarding the suggestion to exchange Section 3.2 and Appendix F, we believe that Section 3.2 is pivotal for understanding why current methods like DPM-Solver++ are suboptimal compared to our RES method. Moving this section could impair the readability and logical flow of the paper. Therefore, we prefer to retain the current structure for better coherence and reader engagement.\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity to discuss these points and hope that our responses adequately address the concerns raised by the reviewer."

                        "value": "Thank you for the detailed review and thoughtful feedback. Your comments are helping improve our work. Below we address specific questions.\n\n## Message from Figure 4\n\nFigure 4 is divided into two parts, each highlighting the significance of implementing order-satisfied numerical schemes in various contexts, including stochastic sampling, text-to-image diffusion, and image super-resolution diffusion:\n- Fig 4(a) presents a comparison between the RES-based stochastic sampling algorithm and the widely-used EDM(Heun)-based stochastic sampling algorithm. This comparison demonstrates that order-satisfied numerical schemes can enhance the efficiency of stochastic sampling.\n- Fig 4(b) explores large-scale text-to-image settings, covering both base text-to-image models and image super-resolution tasks. Our results show that, within the same computational budget, our approaches achieve superior image quality, as indicated by lower FID scores, and better text-image alignment, as evidenced by higher CLIP scores, compared to existing methods. Thanks to great interest in AIGC with text-to-image, we believe RES can accelerate various diffusion applications.\n## RES for stochastic sampling; what is the setup\n\nRecent studies, including EDM [1], have demonstrated that stochastic sampling often surpasses deterministic methods in performance. Drawing inspiration from stochastic EDM, we adapted our algorithm for a stochastic environment. This involves adding extra stochasticity after each Runge-Kutta (RK) step, which corresponds to a nonzero value of $\\eta$  in Algorithm 2. Our approach utilizes the RES single-step update scheme, in contrast to the Heun update-step scheme used by the baseline EDM.\n\nIn our study, we explored two key aspects:\n\n- The impact of the number of function evaluations (NFE) on image quality, as measured by the FID score, is shown in the left panel of Figure 4(a).\n- The relationship between NFE and the magnitude of stochasticity (indicated by the magnitude of $\\eta$) is presented in the right panel of the same figure.\n\nWe have included more discussion on these findings in the revised version of our paper.\n\n## Figure 1b should be in the appendix \n\nWe respectfully disagree with the suggestion to move Figure 1b to the appendix. This figure is central to our analysis, as it illustrates the core methodology for error propagation and the derivation of the order condition. We believe that including this diagram within the main body of the text, particularly in conjunction with Section 3.2, aids readers in grasping the intuition and derivation process more easily.\n## Can the uniform Lipschitz assumption can be removed from the present work?\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, removing the Lipschitz assumption is a non-trivial challenge. As discussed in Section 3.2 and illustrated in Figure 1(b), the primary source of error arises from approximating a non-linear function with a finite number of function evaluations. Without the Lipschitz assumption, the underlying non-linear function could exhibit high oscillations, making it challenging to develop an efficient numerical scheme that effectively minimizes numerical errors in the worst case. We leave the interesting and challenging question for future work.\n\n## dashline in figure 3\n\nTo match the performance of DPM-Solver ++ (S) at 99 NFE, our RES single-step method requires only 59 NFE. This comparison, illustrated in the figure, underscores our method's acceleration capabilities, particularly in the paragraph of \"Time-scheduling robustness\".\n## Typos and mistakes in the appendix\nThanks for the author's detailed review. We fix them in our revision."

Below we address specific questions.\n\n## How it compared against existing works, such as step-distillation work and consistency models.\n\n* Our work primarily concentrates on training-free methods for pre-trained diffusion models. The majority of our experiments and discussions are centered around methodologies within this category. We have included a discussion of suggested methods in our related work section.\n* The methods you've suggested, such as step-distillation, demand additional training. As for the consistency model, it is indeed a novel approach that offers faster sampling speeds. However, it has not yet been extensively validated in large-scale tasks, such as text-to-image settings, and currently shows a significant performance gap when compared to diffusion models.\n* It's also worth noting that the suggested works, including progressive distillation and consistency distillation, rely on ODE solvers as a foundational element or 'teacher'. Therefore, our method has the potential to accelerate these processes as well.\n## Can this method be applied for conditional generation with classifier-free guidance? I don't think the paper mention it.\nOur paper indeed addresses the application of our method in various settings, including conditional generation with classifier-free guidance:\n* In our text-to-image (DeepFloyd IF) experiments, both Figure 2 and Figure 4 in the paper illustrate how our approach accelerates classifier-free guidance.\n* Additionally, for classifier-based guidance, we have included relevant experiments in the appendix. Please refer to Figure 6 for detailed insights.\n\n## In fig2, why is the multistep setting even worse than the single step?\n\nWe believe this question pertains to the third subplot in Figure 3, where various methods are tested under a suboptimal time schedule. Both multistep and single-step methods approximate the nonlinear function using a polynomial. However, unlike single-step methods that query new function evaluations, multistep methods attempt to save on evaluations by reusing previous ones, which may become outdated. In a suboptimal time schedule, the disadvantage of relying on these outdated evaluations could negate the benefit of conserving new evaluations. This results in poorer performance compared to single-step methods, which, despite incurring extra evaluations, obtain up-to-date information for nonlinear function approximation."
