The strategy mixes the estimate of Q functions of the source (or the target of previous iteration) and the target task setups. The setups may differ with an altering task complexities, which are reflected in the state and action space, transition model and reward sparsity. Concretely, the mixing strategy adopts a softmax operation which is adjusted by a temperature parameter. The idea is validated in learning a set of simple gym environments, such as mountain car and taxi cab. Part of the results support a favoured learning efficiency with the introduced curriculum transfer strategy."

It is hard to tell what are the formal and quantitative definition of the task complexities. The paper seems particularly ambitious to cover as many variations as possible while somehow looses the focus. The validation seems solely focusing on some of the task variations while not demonstrating on transferring between different state/action spaces.\n3. The validation assumes the existence of a strategy to generate a curriculum, which is actually central to curriculum learning. If the investigation is about what transfer strategy to use, it would make more sense to benchmark other competing transfer strategies. The baselines like \\pi_1 look weak.\n4. The results are hard to interpret their significance. That is probably due to visualisation, e.g. in Fig. 4, showing extremely large variance. It is hard to tell the competing methods apart due to the overlap. It might be more readable to use table to report statistics at a selected set of episode steps.\n5. The benchmarking tasks could be stronger. Curriculum learning has demonstrated in learning with more complex environment dynamics. Demonstrating efficacy could significantly improve the paper's soundness and significance."

What might be the correlation to the theoretical motivation of Duelling DQN?\n2. Is there a more unified and formal way of presenting the task degree-of-freedom. What types of scope we can expect this strategy might be able to handle beyond the examples presented here?\n3. The validation tasks look similar in terms of the problem scale and underlying task goal. Could the paper provide more evidence on problems with a larger scale and different task essences?"

The new method differs from previous approaches in the way it modifies the degrees of freedom of the target task and employs the value function for knowledge transfer. The method leverages curriculum learning to breakdown the complex tasks to simpler subtasks based on its degree of freedom. Specifically, the process involves modifying the degrees of freedom within a target task to create one or more easier source tasks. The value function encodes granular information about task execution and a transfer learning method is used to learn the complex tasks from easier tasks. The actions between source and target policies are interleaved for self-correction. One key difference from previous methods is that the authors do not reuse artificial neural network (ANN) weights or demanding state/action mappings for different tasks. Empirical results are provided using classical reinforcement learning (RL) problems sourced from the OpenAI Gym library by making adjustments to the degrees of freedom for each task. For example, for the mountain car problem, the authors adjust the degree of freedom for the transition function related to the friction. The authors also include ablation analysis of q-weighted combination."

While curriculum learning is certainly an important topic within reinforcement learning, I do not understand the approach being proposed in this paper. On top of the many technical concerns I have (see below), I don't understand why such a knowledge transfer mechanism is needed. If the state-action space is the same between tasks, why not simply train each task until convergence (or some other training heuristic) and then move on to training the subsequent task in the curriculum as is commonly done? If the state-action space is not the same, then this method will also need to leverage some method to deal with it just as standard curriculum learning would (e.g. through bootstrapping, action advising, policy distillation, etc).\n* The technical details of the proposed approach are also not clear to me. Early in training in the target task, the target Q-function will not have converged and will have poor estimates. And if we use the Q-function from the source task, wouldn't it be out-of-distribution in the target task? In addition, why would we assume that the Q-value in the source task is a proxy for a good action in the target task, when the tasks differ? Under what conditions is this expected to work? Why do this sort of blending at all, why not just start with the policy from the source task and perform standard RL training in the target task?\n* The experimental results do not include comparisons to any sort of baseline, including a standard curriculum training setup where policies are simply trained to convergence in a sequence of tasks. The figures are also not clear to me (e.g. Figure 3), I am not sure what I am supposed to take away from them and they are quite difficult to read. For example, the text says the learning process is significantly enhanced but what indicates this?"

Why not simply sequentially train a policy to convergence on each task in the curriculum (maintaining the weights between each task)?\n2) If we do desire this knowledge transfer, would the Q-function estimates be accurate? If we are learning the Q-function in each task, we wouldn't have an accurate estimate until well into training (at which point, would we still need to transfer knowledge?), so wouldn't these be inaccurate estimates? Won't the source task Q-function be out-of-distribution in the target task as well?"

                    "value": "However, the reviewer finds this paper hard to follow, and it requires significant improvements in clarity.\n\n1)  A lot of technical details are missing or need to be clarified. For example, a) the paper mentioned that 'source tasks are sampled based on their complexity' many times. But what's the sampled policy? b) Also, the paper mentioned that 'the state space is different, then a function $s_{\\mathcal{M}}(\\phi) = h(s_{\\mathcal{M}_t}(\\phi))$ is needed'. What does $h(\\cdot)$ define? How to learn $h(\\cdot)$? Is it pre-defined by humans? What's $\\phi$? c) In Section 4.2, does the equation update the source Q-functions? Why? d) The formula '$\\alpha +\\beta=1$ and $\\alpha>\\beta=1$ ' does not make sense. e) The way to combine a set of Q-functions into one source Q-function is not clear.\n\n2)  The contents are inconsistent. For example, 'self-correction' and 'self-correcting' are mixed-used.\n3)  Some typos exist in the paper, making it hard to understand.\n4) The figures are hard to read.\n\nNo limitations are discussed in this paper. For example,\n1) Using $\\max(Q)$ makes the paper not able to extend to continuous action spaces.\n2) The curriculum is defined by humans, which is infeasible to be applied to complex domains, requiring a certain amount of expert domain knowledge.\n3) There are a lot of related works doing the same thing as this paper [1-3], while they automatically generate the curriculum.\n\n[1] Emergent complexity and zero-shot transfer via unsupervised environment design - Dennis et al.NEURIPS 2020\n\n[2] Evolving curricula with regret-based environment design - Parker-Holder et al.
