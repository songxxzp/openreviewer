                    "value": "The experiments are inadequate given the rapid progress in implicit neural representations since SIREN. The authors need to demonstrate that HOSC makes a difference on 3D objects and scenes (e.g. the NeRF dataset) and/or gigapixel images, and/or continues to yield benefits when combined with modern INR parameterizations such as DVGO, TensorRF, Instant NGP, etc. In particular, DVGO was explicitly designed to address this same issue of capturing sharp boundaries in 3D, so this method should also be compared against. I believe SIREN or ReLU networks (with positional encodings) can easily fit the cameraman image with the right choice of hyperparameters, so if the authors want to argue that efficient training is HOSC's primary benefit then they need to actually scale this method to a real use case (e.g. radiance fields of a real 3D scene) and show improvements in training time compared to other fast methods like Instant NGP. If not, then the authors need to reconsider the motivation for this method. The authors saying that they \"focus on pure representation learning, without altering the input signal with a predefined mapping function\" is not a reasonable excuse, if they cannot justify why this \"pure\" method is more useful for any specific application.\n\nMinor:\n- heatmap/residual scales should be standardized in figures 4, 5, 6 and 8"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nThank you for your constructive feedback! We address the key points raised as follows:\n\n(1) Unique Contribution of HOSC: Our primary contribution lies in introducing a periodic activation function akin to SIREN, which inherently encodes the signal. This eliminates the need for \u201cexplicit\u201d positional encoding, like precomputed Fourier domain feature (FFT, etc.) and adaptive-hybrid encoding, like DVGO, TensorRF, and Instant NGP, or Dictionary Fields. \nOur activation function combines encoding and signal representation in one. This approach results in a more compact network, lower dimensional input, reduced memory footprint, (and faster training, compared to precomputed Fourier Features). Unlike Fourier or other positional encodings, which significantly increase memory usage, or hybrid encodings, which add memory and significant implementation complexity, HOSC offers a streamlined and efficient alternative.\n\n(2) Extended Evaluations: We have expanded our evaluations to include 3D Signed Distance Functions (3D SDFs) and Giga-Pixel images, demonstrating HOSC's versatility and quality of reconstructions. We acknowledge that periodic activations generally face challenges with NeRF applications (also SIREN is not used with NeRFs). However, the added evaluations in 3D SDFs and large-scale images provide a comprehensive understanding of HOSC's capabilities. Regarding 3D SDFs we reach reconstruction quality in the range of the recent method Dictionary Fields (please compare our results with their figure: https://apchenstu.github.io/FactorFields/img/sdfs.png)"

We address the mentioned issues in the new, revised version of the paper. \n\nWe notice that the reviewer has lowered the original score of 8 to 5, which we regret to see. In fact, we believed the reviewer was in favor of the paper as it was intended: a novel activation which has versatile applications in MLPs for reconstruction/approximation of high-frequency details. Originally, it was not our intention to take part in the current race of reconstructions with sophisticated data structures (ala voxels, octrees, dictionaries, etc.), but to provide a simple elegant smooth solution of the problem. \n\nNonetheless, we agree that showcasing the performance in comparison with existing modern methods is of essential importance. In the current revision we were able to perform experiments to 3D SDFs and Giga Pixel images and have included our results in the paper. We were not able to run all experiments of other methods in our framework in that short time, but we have tailored our results to be comparable to theirs, most notably the very recent results from Chan 2023b showcased on their github: https://apchenstu.github.io/FactorFields/img/sdfs.png. We also used exactly their datasets for training and validation in our experiments, hence the comparison can be seen as fair. We kindly ask the reviewer to note the quality of HOSC compared to others as well.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 References: We have ensured that all the figures are properly referenced in the revised manuscript, providing the necessary context and explanations.\n\nExpanding Experiment 1: Your suggestion to include more results, such as loss values and fitting figures for complex or random signals, is well-received. We agree that demonstrating HOSC's performance on more complex or random signals would substantiate our claims further. In our revised submission, we will include additional results for these types of signals, showcasing HOSC's versatility and effectiveness beyond regular signals. We believe these revisions will enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of our paper, and we appreciate the opportunity to improve our work based on your valuable feedback."

Comparisons to only SIREN and ReLU networks are not very extensive. I am not sure I agree with the fact that positional encoding should not be included in the comparison, since an embedding layer as the first layer of a network seems reasonable to me and is what is used for most coordinate-based applications now. No comparison to this severely limits the impact as researchers who work with these networks will be unlikely to change to something like HOSC without a detailed comparison. Additionally, there are a number of other alternate coordinate-based network architectures which are not compared to. For example, a brief search reveals [1] and [2], which also claim improvement over ReLU and SIREN architectures. There is no reason why HOSC should not be compared to these.\n\n    1b. The comparisons are only done for \"overfitting\" signals, i.e. memorizing a 1D/2D/3D function values, and not for utilizing these representations in inverse problems, as is how they are mainly used in research. For example, using \"radiance fields\" as a motivation for improving the fitting of coordinate-based networks, and then not demonstrating how HOSC performs in radiance field applications seems like an overclaim. This is because the inverse problem solved in radiance fields not only requires accurate fitting of the supervised values, but accurate interpolation between these values for novel view synthesis (see next point). Lack of comparison here severely limits the applicability of HOSC to a narrow range of cases, perhaps on signal overfitting or compression, which is not emphasized as the efficiency of networks using HOSC is not compared (such as, showing that it can fit a signal with less parameters for example).\n\n    1c. The paper makes no attempt to evaluate the \"generalization\" properties of coordinate-based networks using the HOSC activation function. For example [3] extensively studies this for Fourier Features, and shows that the frequency affects how well these networks generalize, or in other words, how they behave between the supervised points. This is an extremely important property of coordinate-based networks in imaging and vision tasks, and it is not explored at all in this paper.\n\n2. One other minor complaint is on the robustness of the method - there seems to be an extra hyperparameter, a, which significantly affects the signal reconstruction quality. Other methods, such as SIREN, also have hyperparameters. For SIREN specifically, the w0 factor described in the original paper affects the quality of the fit considerably. Why is a tuned, but not w0? I am not sure if it is a fair comparison, and without testing both of these, I'm not sure how robust HOSC is to various levels of a.\n\nOne minor comment: In the 4th sentence of the paper, m=5 (position and view direction) and n=4 (color and opacity) for radiance fields, not m=4, n=3.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=OmtmcPkkhT\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01553\n\n[3] https://bmild.github.io/fourfeat/"

                    "value": "I do not have additional questions on the paper. I view the lack of comparisons a significant weakness of the paper, and expanding upon this axis would significantly increase the strength of the paper. Specifically, including additional comparisons to other work which has been published and shown to improve upon ReLU and SIREN architectures in signal fitting is crucial. Additionally, without a study on the generalization within the signal domain properties and/or a comparison on solving an inverse problem task where coordinate-based networks are actually used, such as radiance field fitting, the HOSC method seems extremely limited to simple problems in fitting 1D/2D/3D signals. Adding these comparisons would be extremely important for writing a high impact paper, where I believe that the potential of HOSC is high as the method does show significant improvement against the baselines on the tasks it is compared on.\n\n**Update after the author response**\n\nI appreciate the additional comparisons, I believe they increase the strength of the paper. However, I am not inclined to change my score. I still see there as being too many limitations: cannot be applied to radiance fields, and lack of generalization evaluation. Note, I do not mean generalization in the sense of deepSDF (between the weights of different representations) but rather generalization in the sense of the Fourier Features paper, where only a subset of values are supervised on and then are interpolated between. I believe this is extremely critical for evaluating the quality of any coordinate-based network."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer,\n\nWe appreciate the thoughtful feedback provided by the reviewer. We address the concerns as follows:\n\n1a. Comparisons with Other Methods: We acknowledge the need for broader comparisons, we address it by providing further experiments on 3D SDF functions and Giga-Pixel images. We use the recent results of Dictionary Fields [4] as reference. \nDue to time constraints, unfortunately we were not able to directly compare our results to \u201ctraditional\u201d Fourier Features Positional Encoding. In fact, tuning of the parameters (especially the scale) of FF-PE turned out to be extremely cumbersome and could not be finalized in time. Nonetheless, we construct our results of 3D SDF in the same fashion as the recent work of Chen 2023b, which can be compared with their results at: https://apchenstu.github.io/FactorFields/img/sdfs.png\n\n1b. Application to NeRFs: as the reviewer surely knows, periodic activation functions (like SIREN) are networks which learn their own Fourier-like encoding and are not used with traditional FF-PE. That particularly turned out not to work well with NeRFs and hence SIRENs are not used to NeRF encoding. This is a limitation of periodic actications and also HOSC shares it. \n\n1c. Generalization Properties: We agree that a test of how HOSC performs on generalization is a very important aspect. Intuitively, we think it will perform very well on Auto Decoders like DeepSDF, as it shows superior performance on overfitting single SDFs.  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were not able to perform this experiment in the rebuttal version. But we will be able to perform it for the final revision of the paper. \n\n2. Our method turns out to be very robust wrt its hyperparameters, in fact, with the extension to AdaHOSC (see main rebuttal answer), we essentially got rid of any parameter tuning. By setting a default initial value for beta=8 (parameter \u201ca\u201d in previous version), we were able to make the model essentially work from scratch in all setups. This is a huge improvement compared to FF-PE, where tuning of the proper scale/sigma turned out to be extremely frustrating (due to its high-sensitivity wrt the signal), and was one of the reasons why we have not included there comparisons in the revision (we will perform it for the final revision though). \n\nMoreover, we would like to point out that in both this and previous revision we extensively tested the \u201cfrequency\u201d parameter \u201cw0\u201d of SIREN (in previous revision called \u201cb\u201d), now called \u201comega\u201d."
