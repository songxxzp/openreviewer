                        "value": "We thank reviewer Zvck for acknowledging our contributions and here is our response regarding the reviewer\u2019s questions and concerns:\n\n1. The simulation itself would benefit from having a comparison to real-world experiments as well. Questions such as how well the dynamic behavior of soft objects matches reality (bouncing objects), or how well the contact model applies to objects sliding/being pushed under friction. \n\nThank you for the thoughtful feedback. We have added real-world experiments to further evaluate our system in Section A.6.2. We also added the real2sim system identification demonstrations on our website to show the comparison between sim and real for pressing, sliding, and twisting scenarios. We believe simulating objects is essential for manipulation, several works such as Pac-Nerf [https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05512], NCLaws [https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14369] have presented the accuracy of soft object simulation with sim-to-real comparison. However, the focus of our work is the tactile sensor simulation and since our simulation system is modulized, it is straightforward to replace one or multiple modules with improved simulation approaches such as simulating objects with FEM or using constraint-based contact models. We would like to explore the fidelity of the different object simulation methods in future work. \n\n2. How does the simulation compare when simulating articulated bodies? For example the lid-opening task, is the hinge a soft body or a joint? How well does this compare to modeling real-world objects?\n\nWe approximate the articulated objects by using the MPM-based approach and assign different materials for different parts. Here the joint is simulated as a soft and thin body, and other parts are simulated as rigid bodies.  We further demonstrated that the optimized trajectory for the case opening task can be successfully deployed on real-world settings with a real articulated object in Section A.6.2.\n\n3. Adding some runtime reports, at least in the appendix, would be appreciated from a practitioner's perspective. MPM or PBD was used to simplify object simulation, is this correct? If so, it would be interesting to see how expensive each part of the simulation is, where simplifications are necessary when used in practice. Were any of the learned grasping or manipulation policies applied on the real robot?\n\nWe have added the running time report in Section A.5 on all four contact-rich tasks. We provide both the simulation time and gradience backpropagation time, along with each simulation module (FEM, contact, MPM/PBD) running time in Table 11. \n\nAnd yes, MPM and PBD are used to simplify object simulation, we do observe fast PBD simulation speed but MPM simulation speed is rather slower because of the large amount of particles we used in simulation.\n\nWe also added two sets of real-world experiments to further evaluate our system in Section A.6.2. First we deploy the optimized trajectory from simulation on real-world robot setup for surface following and box opening tasks. Then we train a grasp stability prediction model in simulation based on tactile sensing data.  We directly apply the trained model to a real-world deformable object grasp task and show that we can adaptively grasp the soft deformable object.\n\n4. For the trajectory optimization tasks in manipulation, it would be interesting to see how many iterations/computational resources each method was given to converge, was it the same for each, or was each method run until convergence?\n\nWe have added the training curves of trajectory optimization on contact-rich manipulation tasks in Section A.4.6. To make a fair comparison with other baselines, we run all experiments with 100 iterations of optimization. From the training loss curves, we see most tasks can converge within 100 iterations. \n\n5. Were the constraints applied to the reinforcement learning methods for trajectory planning also applied to the gradient-based optimization?\n\nYes. Since our system is implemented with semi-explicit solvers which require a small simulation step size, we constrain the action space to [-0.15, 0.15] for RL and set small learning rates for gradient-based methods to ensure the stability of the simulation. And we use the same initial trajectories for both the gradient-based method and RL methods."

                        "value": "6. In Table 1, should the Tacchi method not also be differentiable since they are implemented in Taichi?\n\nIt is true that Tacchi is implemented with Taichi, and it can be differentiable in theory. However, the authors of Tacchi didn\u2019t implement the gradient backpropagation which is non-trivial and didn\u2019t show any trajectory optimization with differential physics.\n\n7. How efficient is it to simulate rigid objects as elastic using MPM and then applying rigidity constraints? Are there any plans on extending the simulator to use rigid-body or articulated-body solvers?\n\nWe admit that it is not the most efficient way to simulate rigid objects by using the MPM method as we report the runtime of object simulation in Table 11. For example, we use a rigid object in the object reposing task, and due to dense particles, the object simulation is the runtime bottleneck. We would like to further extend our simulation system to support rigid-body and articulated-body models. \n\n8. Are the results found from the SysID parameters used for the follow-up tasks?\n\nYes, we use the identified tactile sensor parameters from Real2Sim for all following manipulation tasks. However, contact parameters such as the surface friction coefficient also depend on object materials. But these can still serve as good references and we use them by adding randomization based on the identified parameters. For object parameters, we randomize them within a range based on the tactile sensor's and contact model\u2019s parameters to make sure the system can stably run.  All parameter details are added in the Section. A.4.5.\n\nWe hope these addressed the concerns and please let us know if there are any further questions!\n\nThanks,\n\nAuthors"

The authors demonstrate the use of the simulator for three tasks. First, in system identification, the goal is to use real-world tactile observations to optimize the simulator\u2019s physical parameters, and then compare the tactile marker and force reading to that of real data. In optical simulation, the visual quality of the optical simulation is examined. In grasping, the task is to use a parallel jaw gripper equipped with tactile sensors to see if tactile feedback is helpful. Finally in manipulation, four tasks are performed: surface following, cable straightening, case opening, and object reposing."

This is rather concerning, as it seems to indicate that the system identification method is not very effective at reducing the sim-to-real gap.\n- Rather than a comparison between using or not using tactile sensing for grasping, which has been validated in prior works, or comparison between different methods for optimizing policies to solve the manipulation tasks, I wish the paper focused more on evaluating how realistic and accurate the tactile sensing simulation is, as well as sim to real applications. I think those are the things that will really impact whether or not practitioners can rely on this simulator to generate conclusions that will hold in the real world.\n- The organization of the paper is slightly confusing: I think it would be easier to understand if the tasks were introduced closer in the text to where the results are presented.

                        "value": "We thank reviewer EisY for acknowledging our contributions and here is our response regarding the reviewer\u2019s questions and concerns:\n\n1. In the system identification task, it seems like the pixel-wise tactile marker mean squared error is extremely high for the real to sim setting, or at least, the standard deviation or standard error (which one is it? It\u2019s not labeled) is much larger than the differences between the different methods, including the random method. \n\nWe have labeled them as standard deviations. We admit the real-2-sim errors are higher than sim-2-sim which is normally because of the real-world sensor noise. Note that 1 pixel in the tactile image space roughly equals 0.113 mm in physical space, thus our real-2-sim is still at the submillimeter level. The mean squared errors are averaged over all markers from all frames, and we see the consistency of our lower errors compared to the baselines. We also observe the same scale consistency of standard deviations. Although standard deviations are higher than the differences between the different methods, these are attributed to the real-data noise level since our sensor is manually manufactured in the laboratory. \n\nWe also added real-world experiments and demonstrated the trajectories optimized in simulation by using the real-2-sim results can be directly deployed on real-world setups. To further improve the real-2-sim results, collecting more data for system identification or using commercialized sensors can be explored as future work. \n\n2. I wish the paper focused more on evaluating how realistic and accurate the tactile sensing simulation is, as well as sim to real applications. \n\nWe have added two sets of real-world experiments to further evaluate our system in Section A.6.2. First we deploy the optimized trajectory from simulation on real-world robot setup for surface following and box opening tasks. Then we train a grasp stability prediction model in simulation based on tactile sensing data.  We directly apply the trained model to a real-world deformable object grasp task and show that we can adaptively grasp the soft deformable object.\n\n3. I think it would be easier to understand if the tasks were introduced closer in the text to where the results are presented. In general I think the clarity of the writing could be improved, for example, to be more explicit about when tactile signals are real or simulated \n\nThank you for the writing suggestions, we have updated the manuscript accordingly. We re-arranged the task description at the beginning of Section 4 Experiments and added clarifications for the experiments. \n\n4. What differentiates the \u201cgrasping\u201d task from the \u201cmanipulation\u201d tasks? \n\nWe have merged the \u201cgrasping\u201d as one of the manipulation tasks. However since we have variations on the grasping task, we kept it stand-alone and renamed the rest four tasks as \u201ccontact-rich manipulation tasks\u201d.\n\n5. Can you provide some intuition or qualitative visualization for why the baselines like PPO and SAC don\u2019t perform well on the manipulation tasks? What are the failure modes?\n\nWe have added the discussions of the experiments in Section A.4.7. Our system is implemented with semi-explicit solvers which require a small simulation step size as a common strategy. Therefore, in our RL experiments, we did not allow the policy to search randomly but within a constraint action space. We initialized the trajectories as the same as the ones used for trajectory optimization and used the same reward functions. This ensures the fairness of comparison. However, after training for 100 iterations, both PPO and SAC\u2019s training losses did not decrease.\nWe intuitively attribute this to: \na. The amount of data we used is insufficient for RL algorithms to learn within 100 iterations. \nb. Our tasks include continuous contact, whereas RL algorithms operate on a per-small-time-step basis, making it challenging to optimize.\nc. RL algorithms in general require more detailed reward designs while the current reward functions are too simple to train proper policies.\n\nWe also added visual demonstrations of the failure cases of RL approaches on our website: https://difftactile.github.io/.\n\n6. I recommend adding periods after paragraph section headings or otherwise distinguishing them from the following text.\n\nThanks for the writing suggestions and we have added space between section headings and texts.\n\n7. For the \u201cexperimental results\u201d on page 9: \u201cFor case opening and object reposing, we define the metric as the opened angle of the lid and the orientation of the object.\u201d I think it\u2019s not quite accurate to refer to the orientation of the object as a metric.\n\nThank you for the writing suggestions, we have rephrased and clarified the sentence.\n\nWe hope these addressed the concerns and please let us know if there are any further questions!\n\nThanks,\n\nAuthors"

I particularly appreciate the addition of the real-world experiments, however, I agree with reviewer TYvh that it is hard to tell whether the performance of the trajectory in the video is due to successful system identification and that additional quantitative and qualitative comparisons to other system ID methods would support the hypothesis much more strongly here. \n\nThank you for the clarification regarding the performance of the RL experiments. It is understandable that having a small time step would make it challenging for those methods to perform well. However, I don't quite understand why it is necessary to not allow the policy to search randomly but instead within a constrained action space. Could you please elaborate on that? It would be helpful if this were clarified in the paper to understand the particular setting of the RL experiments for future practitioners. I could imagine that a carefully tuned RL configuration could learn to solve these tasks as well, and while I understand that differentiability is a key feature of DIFFTACTILE, it seems that the additional learnability of these tasks with RL would only be a plus. The contributions on the simulation side are significant and strong in my opinion, but seems orthogonal to the message that RL simply works more poorly than gradient-based optimization (which is what Table 5 seems to be showing).\n\nI will keep my score for now, but am willing to increase it given further evidence from real-world experiments."

                        "value": "Hi reviewer EisY,\n\nThanks again for your insightful feedback to strengthen our work!\n\nRegarding the RL action space searching:\n- We use a penalty-based contact model to couple the FEM-base sensor with MPM/PBD-base objects. That means during each simulation step, we first update both the mesh nodes of the sensor and the particles of the object, if penetration happens, we push the particles out of the mesh surface to bound the contact. If the action step is too large, the penetrations would be too aggressive which will lead to the flipped FEM element volumes and the system will crash. To keep the stability of the system, we need to constraint to small actions. We admit this is one limitation of the semi-explicit system. It is possible to resolve this issue by switching to an implicit system that is more tolerant of the large simulation step size. However, we would like to highlight the advantages of the semi-explicit system: the implementation simplicity especially for the gradient backward, faster running speed for small-scale systems (such as thousands of mesh nodes for FEM as our current settings), and easier to customize and adapt to various tasks. \n\nRegarding the real-world experiments:\n- We have incorporated a new comparison with a baseline system identification method on the real-world box opening task as visualized on our website. Notably, the baseline method predicted a higher Young's modulus value, indicating a stiffer sensor material. This leads to the optimized trajectory exhibiting lighter force application during the box opening, therefore the policy fails to transfer to the real world. We believe that our real-world experiments have shown the potential of our simulators.\n- While we demonstrated the role of system identification in enhancing sim-to-real transfer, there exist alternative approaches to bridge sim-to-real gaps, such as data augmentation and domain randomization. Our proposed simulator provides a platform to explore these approaches, as one part of our contribution. System identification, in our perspective, acts as a \"helper\" rather than a \"unique enabler\" in minimizing these gaps. Thus, while we appreciate the value of using sim-to-real downstream tasks to assess system identification, the real2sim2real is only one application of our simulation and the fundamental question we are trying to answer here is whether the policy optimized in our simulator can be combined with existing technique to enable sim2real transfer.\n- We would like to emphasize that our main contributions of this work are providing a tactile simulator that supports differential physics, optical simulation, a broad range of object manipulation, and demonstrating various manipulation tasks in both simulation and real world. System identification is only a part of our contribution. To the best of our knowledge, our tactile simulator is the first to integrate all these features. We wish the reviewer to reevaluate our contribution based on the broader significance of our work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAuthors"

The simulator consists of 4 components: 1) sensor deformation through FEM 2) Optical simulation model that maps sensor deformation to rgb reflected color. 3) Objects are modeled using least square material point and position based dynamics. 4) penalty based contact model which goes from deformation, represented by SDF, to forces. They evaluated the simulator in 3 tasks: system identification which basically tries to estimate the sensor params from a set of collected real sensor data. The second task is grasping fragile objects and finally manipulating non-rigid objects such as straightening a cable."

The deformable surface is simulated by a finite element model, with contact forces based on penetration penalty. Surface normals of the deformed tactile surface are used by a neural network to predict the RGB colour of the reflected light. All these operations are differentiable\n\nThe paper presents experiments about system identification, grasping, and various manipulation tasks - all in simulation. The differential nature of the simulator allows gradient-based trajectory optimization for these tasks. Experiments show that this outperforms CMA-ES and RL."

                        "value": "We thank reviewer TYvh for acknowledging our contributions and here is our response regarding the reviewer\u2019s questions and concerns:\n\n1. This paper lacks sim2real task performance experiments.\n\nWe have added two sets of real-world experiments to further evaluate our system in Section A.6.2. First we deploy the optimized trajectory from simulation on real-world robot setup for surface following and box opening tasks. Then we train a grasp stability prediction model in simulation based on tactile sensing data.  We directly apply the trained model to a real-world deformable object grasp task and show that we can adaptively grasp the soft deformable object.\n\n2. Is CMA-ES not applicable to the system identification task (Section 4.1)? If it is, please discuss why it was not used as a baseline.\n\nCMA-ES is applicable to the system identification task and we have updated Table 2 with CMA-ES results as baselines. From the results, we observed that CMA-ES performs second best after our proposed method in sim2sim scenarios, outperforming other baselines. However, its performance on real2sim is worse than RNN.\n\n3. A lack of discussion of computation time, especially the FEM-based deformation module. What is the computational runtime of the proposed method, and how does it affect the intended applications?\n\nWe have added the running time report in Section A.5 on all four contact-rich tasks. We provide both the simulation time and gradience backpropagation time, along with each simulation module (FEM, contact, MPM/PBD) running time in Table 11. \n\nFrom the runtime reports, we show that the FEM module in the system can run greater than 30 fps for forward simulation, but the whole system\u2019s speed also depends on object simulation and will double for the gradient backpropagation (backward). For example, the slowest task case opening requires 6 hours to optimize one trajectory with 600 simulation steps.\n\n4. A lack of implementation details like RNN structure for parameter identification, optical prediction network architecture (Section 4.2), mathematical formulations of the reward functions used for the manipulation tasks (Section 4.4).\n\nWe have added the RNN structure details in Section A.2. We also added the details of the reward functions in Section A.4.3 and A.4.4. Optical prediction network architecture will be added in Section A.3.\n\n5. Which simulation parameters are used for the manipulation experiments in Section 4.4? Are they the parameters identified from the real robot system?\n\nWe have added the simulation parameter details in Section A.4.5. Yes, we use the identified tactile sensor parameters from Real2Sim for all the following manipulation tasks. However, contact parameters such as the surface friction coefficient also depend on object materials. But these can still serve as good references and we use them by adding randomization based on the identified parameters. For object parameters, we randomize them within a range based on the tactile sensor's and contact model\u2019s parameters to make sure the system can stably run.\n\nWe hope these addressed the concerns and please let us know if there are any further questions!\n\nThanks,\n\nAuthors"

For the surface following and box opening task, we used the system-identified parameters (in Tables 12 & 13). For the grasp stability prediction task, we added domain randomization on parameters (in Table 15) to improve the performance.  We believe the surface following & box opening tasks show the real-to-sim-to-real and the grasping task shows the sim-to-real.\n- Thanks for bringing up this great point and we do agree that task-based evaluation would be another good metric. We have been working on real-world experiment evaluation for other baselines. Based on current observations, we do see accurate system identification indeed affects real-world contact-rich robotic manipulations. For example, in the box opening task, the optimized trajectories vary with sensors with different softness and affect the success rate of policy transfer. We will upload the video results soon. \n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions! \n\nBest regards, \n\nAuthors"

                        "value": "Hi reviewer TYvh,\n\nThanks again for your insightful feedback to strengthen our work!\n\n\n- We have incorporated a new comparison with a baseline system identification method on the real-world box opening task as visualized on our website. Notably, the baseline method predicted a higher Young's modulus value, indicating a stiffer sensor material. This leads to the optimized trajectory exhibiting lighter force application during the box opening, therefore the policy fails to transfer to the real world. We believe that our real-world experiments have shown the potential of our simulators.\n- While we demonstrated the role of system identification in enhancing sim-to-real transfer, there exist alternative approaches to bridge sim-to-real gaps, such as data augmentation and domain randomization. Our proposed simulator provides a platform to explore these approaches, as one part of our contribution. System identification, in our perspective, acts as a \"helper\" rather than a \"unique enabler\" in minimizing these gaps. Thus, while we appreciate the value of using sim-to-real downstream tasks to assess system identification, the real2sim2real is only one application of our simulation and the fundamental question we are trying to answer here is whether the policy optimized in our simulator can be combined with existing technique to enable sim2real transfer.\n- We would like to emphasize that our main contributions of this work are providing a tactile simulator that supports differential physics, optical simulation, a broad range of object manipulation, and demonstrating various manipulation tasks in both simulation and real world. System identification is only a part of our contribution. To the best of our knowledge, our tactile simulator is the first to integrate all these features. We wish the reviewer to reevaluate our contribution based on the broader significance of our work.\n\nBest regards,\n\nAuthors"
