In general, the parameterization of the transition kernel is non-convex, and the loss function is estimated empirically. Thus, it could be hard to find the global optimizer, or find a good estimation of the global minimizer.\n- The above problem also exists in (6) and (7) for estimating $\\beta$."

                        "value": "We are grateful for your insightful comment and would like to address your concerns in this response.\n\n> Regarding the PD algorithm (3) and (4)\n\nThank you. The PD algorithm (3) and (4) is an implementable version of equation (1) - the constrained minimization problem. Regarding your concern on the non-convexity of (1), we would like to discuss on the objective function $V_P^{\\pi}$ and the empirical loss function $\\mathcal{E}_n(P)$ with respect to $P$ in the following.\n\n**Regarding $V_P^{\\pi}$.** While $V_P^{\\pi}$ is in general not a convex function in $P$, we would like to present here a promising way of handling the non-convex optimization problem to address your concern. We view it as a future direction, which is out of the scope of our current work.\n\nMotivated by that DL and RL both involve optimizing non-convex objectives, non-convex optimization is a rising field and many recent works demonstrate the global convergence of gradient descent (GD): [Zou et al., 2020] and [Ding et al., 2022] show that GD methods converge to globally optimal solutions in over-parameterized neural networks. [Agarwal et al., 2021] and [Bhandari and Russo, 2019] demonstrate the global optimality of policy gradient methods. In our case, the proposed GD method for problem (1) can be considered a counterpart of the policy gradient method, i.e., \"model gradient method.\" Specifically, we can view the fixed policy $\\pi_t$ as the transition model, and minimizing $V_P^{\\pi_t}$ w.r.t. $P$ in Eq. (1) may be viewed as finding the best \"policy\" that minimizes the overall cost. Techniques from [Agarwal et al., 2021] and [Bhandari and Russo, 2019] can then be naturally employed to prove that the model gradient method for Eq. (1) can find the global minimizer. In particular, their key results arise from the form of policy gradient and performance difference lemma, providing a gradient dominance condition typically needed for the global optimality of first-order methods for non-convex objectives. Similarly, by considering the form of model gradient (w.r.t. $P$) instead of policy gradient (w.r.t. $\\pi$), and considering the simulation lemma (difference in values between two $P^{\\prime}$ s) instead of the performance difference lemma (difference in values between two $\\pi^{\\prime}$ ), an analogous gradient dominance condition for $P$ could be naturally derived. As a result, the global minimizer for Eq. (1) can be found efficiently using primal-dual gradient descent Eq.(3)(4).\n\n**Regarding $\\mathcal E(P)$.** Though the empirical loss function $\\mathcal E(P)$ is non-convex in general, it is indeed convex for a large class of distributions. For example, when $P$\nis in an exponential family, then the negative likelihood is convex (Corollary 1.6.2. of [5]). Given that the empirical loss function is convex, the level set of the empirical loss function (i.e. the constraint set) is also convex.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zou, Difan, et al. \"Gradient descent optimizes over-parameterized deep ReLU networks.\" Machine learning 109 (2020): 467-492.\n\n[2] Ding, Zhiyan, et al. \"Overparameterization of deep ResNet: zero loss and mean-field analysis.\" Journal of machine learning research (2022).\n\n[3] Agarwal, Alekh, et al. \"On the theory of policy gradient methods: Optimality, approximation, and distribution shift.\" The Journal of Machine Learning Research 22.1 (2021): 4431-4506.\n\n[4] Bhandari, Jalaj, and Daniel Russo. \"Global optimality guarantees for policy gradient methods.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.01786 (2019).\n\n[5] Bickel, Peter J., and Kjell A.

However, the literature have shown that when a model class that contains the true MDP model is given, value-function classes that satisfy a version of Bellman-completeness can be automatically induced from the model class [4]. This implies that model realizability is even stronger than Bellman-completeness.\n\n(2) The paper claims that the size of the function can be arbitrarily large. However, in Theorem 1 (the performance of Algorithm 2), the sample complexity clearly depends on the size of the function class $|\\mathcal{F} _ {t,i}|$. In addition, I believe both the performance of Algorithm 1 and 2 depends on the size of the model class, and model classes can be even larger than function classes.\n\n(3) The paper does not need a parametric policy class.

                        "value": "Thank you for your constructive feedback. We would like to address you concerns point by point in this response.\n\n> Regarding novelty and significance\n\nWe acknowledge that theoretical techniques involved in conservative policy evaluation, policy improvement, and their combination have been explored in related work. However, we believe that the integration of these techniques in our study offers valuable insights, particularly in the context of model-based offline RL under general function approximation settings without the need for explicit policy parameterization.\n\nThe theoretical results of our approach, as detailed in Theorem 1, enables the separation of model learning and policy learning. This separation allows for the use of an arbitrarily large function class for the (augmented) value function and an unlimited policy class. This aspect of our work is distinct from existing studies such as those by Xie et al., Cheng et al., Bhardwaj et al., and Rashidinejad et al. In particular, our method does not require explicit policy parameterization, setting it apart from these prior works.\n\n> The empirical performance...\n\nWe understand your concern about its comparative performance relative to RAMBO, IQL, and CQL. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the primary focus of our work is on the theoretical aspects of the algorithm. The empirical experiments were designed to support the theoretical findings rather than to showcase state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the hyperparameters used in our experiments were tuned based on heuristics rather than through rigorous optimization.\n\n> Regarding Bellman completeness\n\nThank you for pointing out the reference and its implications regarding the realizability of the transition model in relation to Bellman completeness. Upon revisiting this reference and considering your observation, we recognize that the condition of model realizability is not a milder condition compared to Bellman completeness. In light of this, we have amended our paper by removing the aforementioned statement from the list of contributions in the revised version.\n\n> The paper claims that the size of the function can be arbitrarily large. However,...\n\nWe are sorry for the confusion. We clarify that we consider two notions of sample sizes in this paper: the sample size $n$ for offline data and the sample size for the Monte-Carlo evaluation $N$. While the offline sample size $n$ is fixed, the sample size of Monte-Carlo simulation $N$ can be picked by the user and arbitrarily large. In Theorem 1, the size of function class $|\\mathcal{F}_{t,i}|$ only depends on $N$, and is not affected by $n$. The ability of $N\\to\\infty$ allows the size of $|\\mathcal{F} _\\\\{t,i\\\\}|$ to be arbitrarily large.\n\n> The paper does not need a parametric policy class. However, in general the computation complexity of the optimization problem Equation 7 will depend on the size of the state space, which can be infinite.\n\nIn algorithm 2, we only need to solve equation (7) for finitely-many states $s$ by using the strategy of Monte-Carlo estimation. In fact, we have illustrated in Appendix A.3 that it takes polynomial time to run Algorithm 2.\n\n> The authors claim that Theorem 1 characterizes the performance of Algorithm 2, but it seems not. \n\nThank you. We clarify that we provide an approximate solution to (1) by implementing the primal-dual algorithm (3)(4). The regularizer in the objective function of (3) forces the transition model to be nearly inside the confidence set. We note that the idea of incorporating a Lagrangian multiplier into the objective function for a constrained optimization problem is common in the optimization literature.\n\nWe hope we have addressed your concerns, and we sincerely appreciate the time and effort you have dedicated to reviewing our paper."

MoMA uses a model-based mirror ascent approach with general function approximations, operating under partial coverage of offline data. The algorithm iteratively and conservatively estimates value functions and updates policies, moving beyond the conventional use of parametric policy classes. With mild assumptions, MoMA\u2019s effectiveness is theoretically assured by establishing an upper bound on the policy\u2019s suboptimality, and practical utility is confirmed through numerical studies."

But in fact, the algorithm with the theoretical result is **different** from the practically implemented version. In particular, the theoretically analyzed algorithm involves pessimistic model learning, while the practical version uses a regularized form. With significantly different algorithms, the claim does not hold. \n\n2. In terms of the theoretically sound version (Algorithm 1), the theoretical novelty is limited. The analysis is based on pessimistic model learning combined with policy mirror descent. The combination seems quite direct given existing works. In particular, in the proof of Theorem 2, the regret decomposition in (15)--(17) is standard analysis of a pessimism-based algorithm. The first term of (18) is standard analysis of policy mirror descent, and the second term of (18) is an application of simulation lemma. Similar analysis has also appeared in the RL literature, e.g., Provable Benefits of Actor-Critic Methods for Offline Reinforcement Learning. \n\n3. The practically implemented version of algorithm is also similar to some existing algorithms. For example, \"Bayesian Optimistic Optimization: Optimistic Exploration for Model-based Reinforcement Learning\" also studies a regularized version of policy optimization algorithm, but for online RL. In addition, MOPO and MoRel has practical implementations of pessimism-based algorithms. \n\n4. The implemented version of algorithm is only tested on three D4RL tasks. It would be great to have more extensive experiments."

We would like to clarify this aspect of our work.\n\nIn our study, we indeed present a theoretical framework for pessimistic model learning as outlined in (1), and alongside, we offer a practical implementation through the primal-dual algorithm as detailed in (3) and (4). We understand your concern about the potential differences between these two approaches. However, we would like to emphasize that the transition from the theoretical model to its practical implementation is grounded in a well-established technique in the optimization literature. This technique involves the incorporation of a Lagrangian multiplier into the objective function to address constrained optimization problems.\n\nThis approach ensures that while the practical implementation may appear as an approximate solution to the theoretical model, it fundamentally retains the core principles and objectives of the initial theoretical design. Therefore, we assert that the theoretically analyzed algorithm and its practical counterpart are aligned in their essence and are not significantly different as might be perceived.\n\n> In terms of the theoretically sound version...\n\nThank you for your comments regarding the theoretical aspects of our work. We acknowledge that theoretical techniques involved in conservative policy evaluation, policy improvement, and their combination have been explored in related work. However, we believe that the integration of these techniques in our study offers valuable insights, particularly in the context of model-based offline RL under general function approximation settings without the need for explicit policy parameterization.\n\nThe theoretical results of our approach, as detailed in Theorem 1, enable the separation of model learning and policy learning. This separation allows for the use of an arbitrarily large function class for the (augmented) value function and an unlimited policy class. This aspect of our work is distinct from existing studies. In particular, our method does not require explicit policy parameterization, setting it apart from these prior works.\n\nAddressing your reference to \"Provable Benefits of Actor-Critic Methods for Offline Reinforcement Learning,\" it's noteworthy that this work primarily focuses on linear models. In contrast, our research extends to more complex and general function approximation settings. \n\n> The practically implemented version...\n\nThank you for the references. We note that the policy classes in the works you mentioned are parameterized. While effective in many scenarios, this approach can be potentially restrictive, particularly when the optimal policy lies outside the pre-specified parametric policy class. Our work, on the other hand, does not need an explicit policy parameterization. By employing mirror ascent in conjunction with our model-based design, we enable our policy class to be sufficiently large, potentially containing the true optimal policy. This flexibility is a fundamental advantage of our approach, addressing limitations inherent in parameterized policy classes.\n\n> The implemented version of algorithm is only...\n\nThank you for the suggestions. Since this work mainly focuses on the theoretical part, we believe the numerical experiments in the D4RL tasks are enough to demonstrate the efficacy of MoMA.\n\n> How to implement the policy update when there is a normalization factor?\n\nThank you. When evaluating a policy, we need to calculate the normalization factor by summing the policy probabilities over all actions. Then we use the evaluated policy to generate Monte-Carlo trajectories. \n\n> How do you update the multiplier $\\lambda$?\n\nThe update rule for $\\lambda$ is described in equation (4). See section 5.3 for an example. In particular, we evaluate the gradient of the empirical loss function, and use it as an ascent direction for $\\lambda$.\n\n> Is it possible to unify these two different versions of algorithms?\n\nThank you for the idea. It is an interesting and challenging problem, and we leave it as a future study.\n\nWe hope we have addressed your concerns. Thank you again for your time and valuable comments."

Additionally, we have included comparisons with the algorithms presented in [2] and [4] to provide a more comprehensive overview.\n\nHowever, we note that there is a specific distinction between our approach and the ones in [2] and [4]. Our methodology does not necessitate the assumption of a parametric policy class in advance.
