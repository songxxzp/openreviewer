For example, Table 1 shows that the scalarization method EGNN outperforms several tensor product methods.\n\n- The Scalar Interaction approach directly uses fragments of input features as the equivariant basis, rather than computing new bases like tensor product methods do. Although this approach is faster, it might compromise expressiveness and universality for certain tasks compared to methods that explicitly compute new bases like tensor products."

                    "value": "The authors present a unifying formulation for equivariant neural networks that combine aspects of tensor product layers and scalarization. Both the tensor product and scalarization equivariance can be written as constructing an equivariant basis and using invariant scalar functions to find the coefficients for the basis vectors. In scalarization, unlike the tensor product layers, the basis is immediately available as the input features themselves are used as part of the basis. However, this method does not apply to higher-order representations beyond type-1 vectors. \n\nThe proposed Scalar Interaction Network (SINet) uses a similar idea -- Replacing Equivariant Basis with Input Feature (REBIF) -- to construct the equivariant basis, but generalizes it to higher order representations. The architecture involves computing scalar values using inner products between input representations of the same type and then passing all the scalars from all the types to an MLP to compute the invariant coefficients. Thus, interaction between the types is achieved and equivariance is maintained without costly operations. Experiments on QM9 and N-body dynamics show that the proposed idea is competitive with state-of-the-art, better than EGNN and TFN, and computationally much faster than using tensor product layers, especially when the maximum order of the representation is high."

Am I understanding this correctly?\n\n2. While Table 1 shows improved results compared to EGNN and TFN, how SINet can do better than TFN is unclear. How are the architectures being compared? Is it based on having the same computational budget?\n\nThese experimental details are the main weaknesses in the paper, in my opinion."

Besides, although the complexity is reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$, the empirical acceleration ratio does not seem to have orders of magnitude faster.\n\n3. **Regarding the empirical performance**: (1). From Table 3, SINet with steerable features in larger L does not consistently yield better performance. In this sense, the significance of scalar interactions is doubtful because the brought acceleration does not enable achieving better performance (even worse, then why not to use the scalarization approaches?); (2). Besides, as in EGNN/SEGNN paper, they provide both MSE and time evaluation on N-body system. The readers would be also curious about the efficiency comparison between scalarization and Scalar Interaction because the latter is a hybrid approach involving scalarization. (3) The performance of Table 1 is not appealing compared to previous baselines. (4) It would be better to conduct ablation studies on the proposed approach."
