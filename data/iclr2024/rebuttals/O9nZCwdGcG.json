                    "value": "* The proposed Biased Temporal Convolution Graph Network (BiaTCGNet) is designed specifically to account for both the temporal and spatial aspects of multivariate time series. Namely, this is achieved through BiaTCGNet\u2019s two constituent modules: a Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN and a Biased GCN. The former is capable of performing instance-independent temporal convolution to capture temporal (intra-instance) correlations within each individual time series, while the latter constructs a graph and diffuses information over it to capture the spatial correlations between the time series instances (channels).\n\n* In contrast to other existing time series forecasting methods, BiaTCGNet explicitly considers missing values in its model design through bias injection in the Multi-Scale Instance PartialTCN module that helps account for the different missing patterns; while progressively updating the missing patterns during Biased GCN\u2019s information diffusion process.\n\n* Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets have been conducted, the results of which suggest that BiaTCGNet achieves improvements of up to 11% over the existing forecasting methods under various scenarios involving missing values.\n\n* The paper is technically sound, well written and organized in a reasonably clear and comprehensive manner. The notation used throughout the paper is clear and consistent."

                    "value": "* Generally speaking, BiaTCGNet appears to be a result of (1) an almost direct application of a TCN with a straightforward modification to account for partial observations (Liu et al., 2018), and (2) leveraging a conventional GCN for learning of an adjacency matrix relying on two node embedding sets so as to capture asymmetric spatial correlations. In that regard, the novelty of this work may be considered incremental. Therefore, I would encourage the authors to further clarify and/or elaborate on the novelty of the two modules within BiaTCGNet.\n\n* In Eq. (8), the authors introduce $\\beta$, a learnable weight that is aimed to serve as a time-window-specific bias that corrects the global spatial correlation strength in accordance with the present missing patterns. Nevertheless, the role of this weight has not been discussed further. I believe that this work would benefit from including the learned values of $\\beta$ for each individual dataset used in the experiments. If possible, I would also suggest that the authors consider including a brief discussion on the interpretation of those values.\n\n* There seems to be a fairly recent work [C1] on attention-based memory networks for joint modeling of local spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in multivariate time series with missing values. Moreover, the forecasting problem formulation in [C1] seems to be consistent with the one considered in this work. Therefore, I would suggest that the authors consider comparing the GCN-M method from [C1] with BiaTCGNet. Alternatively, I would ask the authors to provide the specific reason as to why this method has not been included among the baselines?\n\n[C1] Zuo, J., Zeitouni, K., Taher, Y., & Garcia-Rodriguez, S.

The paper compared MAE, MAPE and RMSE; it's the authors' choice what loss function to be used. Hence, if the task is to optimize for RMSE, the loss function for all the tested methods should be RMSE because the output would be the optimal mean estimator. Without such clarity, it's hard to derive where the accuracy difference comes from; is it from the matching loss function and evaluation metric, or is it from architecture innovation?\n(2) for MAE and MAPE, both are the evaluation metric for the median estimate as the denominator from MAPE, without clarifying, is assumed to be the same for all methods? But I saw for example in Table 2, under these two metrics, the ranking of methods can differ. This made me worry whether the experiment setup or the metric calculation is different from what I assumed.\n\nAnother minor note: an interval is implied for all the reported results and only in caption from Table 2, it was mentioned that 'the results are averaged over 5 runs'. What are these 5 runs referring to? Do they refer to different random seeds for training only? I assumed so given that the paper mentioned the train/test/validate is splitter based on ratio chronically which will fix the dataset so no variation from the data."

Is it from the matching loss function and evaluation metric, or is it from architecture innovation. \n\n>Under the rank of MAE and MAPE, the ranking of methods can differ.\n\nA1\n\nThanks for pointing us this ambiguity. We actually adopt the **MAE** as our **training loss**, and we have revised the Equation-2 to make it clear.  Regarding the ranking difference of MAE and MAPE, they are indeed the same metric up to a normalization (denominator), however, the **denominators are not a fixed constant** and change against different points (y_t). As a consequence, the **ranking of the two metrics can differ** even for the same method and dataset, and this is also observed in prior work [1, 2]. \n\nQ2\n\n> It was mentioned that 'the results are averaged over 5 runs'. What are these 5 runs referring to? Do they refer to different random seeds for training only?\n\nA2\n\nYes, the five-runs mean **different random seeds for training only**, i.e., we run a method for 5 rounds with different random seeds and calculate the averaged values from the 5 rounds. We have revised the paper to make it clear now.\n\nQ3\n\n> Introducing missing masks to feature map, motivated from vision tasks, makes sense; yet it'd be good to compare against, introducing the missing masks as input feature directly so the model can be trained with the knowledge what inputs are missing.\n\nA3\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We have **changed the experimental setting for all baseline methods** such that they all take the missing masks as direct input features on all datasets. This can indeed improve the performance of most methods, especially for those Transformer-based ones. We have **revised the manuscript** to include the corresponding analysis and discussion. \n\nQ4\n\n> It was implied that the proposed approach could capture missing pattern; yet the experiments seem to only tested the scenario where values are missing at random. In actual application, it's rare that values are missing at random. It'd be good to also test different scenarios to show the efficacy of the proposed methods. \n\nA4\n\nThanks for your suggestion. We now included an **additional experiment** to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method **under the block missing scenarios**. In particular, we follow the setting of prior work [3] by adopting two block-missing rates of 0.15\\% and 0.2\\% to test different models on the Metr-LA and ETTh1 datasets. The corresponding results are presented in Table 4 of the Appendix. Notably, our proposed **BiaTCGNet** demonstrates its superiority consistently, **achieving a remarkable 5\\% improvement** over the best baseline method.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zonghan Wu, Shirui Pan, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Xiaojun Chang, and Chengqi Zhang.
