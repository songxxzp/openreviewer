It discusses the limitations of large or foundation models in healthcare and highlights the need for aligning AI systems with guardrails for safety in healthcare. Overall, the paper proposes a general discussion on the role of generative AI and LLM in healthcare by providing qualitative insights on how these models can support physicians in identifying the best treatment option for a given patient context."

Self-supervised learning is a type of learning objective, whereas Transformer and Diffusion models are specific types of model architectures.
