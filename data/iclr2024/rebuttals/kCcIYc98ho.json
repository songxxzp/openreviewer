                    "value": "This paper investigates a critical issue within existing PbRL techniques, particularly focusing on the potential adverse effects stemming from corrupted preferences provided by non-expert human labelers. To address this problem, the authors propose a novel approach called Mixing Corrupted Preferences (MCP). This method involves applying a Mixup technique to augment the data, enhancing the model's robustness against faulty instances and improving feedback efficiency, even when working with limited data. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated against state-of-the-art techniques in a standard PbRL benchmark. The results demonstrate that the proposed MCP method outperforms PEBBLE in terms of both robustness and feedback efficiency, while also effectively complementing SURF. A key contribution of this work lies in introducing the Mixup technique into the PbRL framework, thereby bolstering its robustness and feedback efficiency, particularly when dealing with corrupted preference data."

This issue is relatively underexplored but holds great significance within the PbRL framework. I appreciate the authors for dedicating their efforts to address this crucial topic.\n\nFurthermore, the idea of the proposed method is elegantly straightforward. It requires only data processing and doesn't necessitate the introduction of complex learning algorithms. This simplicity renders it easily implementable and adaptable to nearly all existing state-of-the-art methods within the conventional PbRL frameworks. In terms of presentation, I feel the paper is well-organized and easy to read."

Although the authors briefly mentioned the limitations in the future work section, I believe a more comprehensive discussion of the implications of this assumption is necessary. For the experimental design, I think it could benefit from a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art PbRL methods, particularly SURF, which also employs data augmentation for PbRL. Additionally, it may be pertinent to consider the paper on RL from diverse humans [1] as a closely related work that approaches the issue of corrupted human preferences as well in a distinct manner. This comparison would be crucial for evaluating the robustness in handling corrupted preferences. However, the authors may not be aware of this work, and they are not the first to address the issue of corrupted preferences. Furthermore, I recommend introducing the Mixup techniques in the preliminary section to enhance the paper's flow. Finally, while I acknowledge the challenges in conducting real human experiments for PbRL in complex control tasks, this work could be further strengthened with user studies conducted with a diverse group of non-expert human labelers.\n\n[1] Xue, W., An, B., Yan, S., & Xu, Z.

Necessity of convexity assumption**  \n\nIn considering the assumption of convex states and actions, we concluded that it is not a crucial requirement for our method. The potential lack of real-world convexity in mixed trajectories does not negatively impact network learning. This is similar to the original mixup approach, which interpolates two image-label pairs that might not always be realistic. Despite this, mixup has shown considerable robustness against adversarial examples and incorrect labels, largely due to vicinal risk minimization.  \nThe primary benefit of mixup is its capacity to generalize and regularize learning process, prioritizing the overall data characteristics over the strict realism of individual augmented samples based on convexity. Moreover, studies involving the augmentation of virtual trajectories have shown significant performance gains without explicitly checking the validity of generated rollouts [1, 2]. Consequently, we have decided to remove the assumptions related to convexity and validity from the description of our method.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Yu, T., Lan, C., Zeng, W., Feng, M., Zhang, Z., & Chen, Z.

Missing related works and comparison**  \n\nWe appreciate the suggestion to consider the paper on RL from diverse human preferences [1] as a related work addressing corrupted human preferences. We have included the paper in the Related Works section. However, we encountered a challenge in conducting a direct comparison due to the unavailability of their method's code. We have reached out to the authors for access to their code. We are hopeful for a positive response and plan to update our manuscript with additional experiments upon receiving it. Meanwhile, to ensure a comprehensive comparison, we have re-implemented other publicly accessible methods [SURF, RUNE and MRN], as mentioned in our response to W2.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Xue, W., An, B., Yan, S., & Xu, Z.

No analysis with actual human-in-the-loop**  \n\nWe understand the value of including real human annotations in our study to further justify the effectiveness of MCP. However, we faced significant challenges, including the absence of a standardized protocol for human annotation and difficulties in maintaining control over various variables for fair comparison.  \nTo ensure a rigorous and fair evaluation, we followed the practices common in numerous established preference-based RL studies [1-4]. These studies typically utilize the B-Pref benchmark [5] for evaluations. The B-Pref benchmark is renowned for its effectiveness in simulating human irrationality, making it a robust and controlled environment for methodological comparisons. This benchmark allows us to assess the performance of MCP in a consistent and reliable manner, compensating for the absence of direct human-in-the-loop analysis.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Kimin Lee, Laura M Smith, and Pieter Abbeel.

Potential negative impact of corrupted preferences and how MCP mitigate the negative impact?**  \nThe negative impact of corrupted preference data is that it can lead to reward estimator that misinterprets user intentions, causing the agent to act inappropriately. Mixing preference data makes it more difficult to merely memorize the corrupted data, acting as a form of regularization [1]. The second benefit is that MCP improves data efficiency by creating unlimited new data, leading to a smoother reward distribution and enhanced generalization. Lastly, it also mitigates overconfidence problem [2], which can hinder the reward estimator learning. Without mixup, training with binary preference labels using binary cross entropy loss might cause significant reward divergence between two trajectories. This happens due to the tendency to assign overly low rewards to non-preferred trajectories (minimizing the likelihood of selecting non-preferred trajectories) and overly high rewards to preferred trajectories (maximizing the likelihood of selecting preferred trajectories). MCP adjusts for this imbalance in trajectory valuation. To evaluate MCP's confidence calibration, we additionally report the reliability diagram and expected calibration error [3] in Appendix D.6 and Figure 16.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Zhang, H., Cisse, M., Dauphin, Y.

Illustration and detailed explanation of newly generated trajectory**  \n\nTo clarify the concept of newly generated trajectories, we have added a visual example in Figure 7 of Appendix B. This illustration shows how two trajectories are mixed. Each trajectory segment consists of state-action sequences of length of $H$. A new trajectory is formed by linearly interpolating these sequences component-wise, based on the mixup ratio $\\lambda$. Consequently, each component (state-action) of the mixed trajectory is a linear combination of corresponding components from the two original trajectories at the same indices."

For more details, please refer to our General Response.  \nRegarding the comparison with [1], we agree that it is highly relevant study. However, a direct comparison has been challenging due to the unavailability of public reproduction and verification for [1].  \nWhile we haven't been able to address this concern directly, we believe our work provides a comprehensive analysis, including more baselines, varied environments, a higher number of runs, and additional in-depth analyses.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Xue, W., An, B., Yan, S., & Xu, Z.

Unfortunately, I did not have time to thoroughly discuss this addition with the authors and some concerns remain (such as the lack of quantitative differences, or the fact that preferences are collected just from the unsupervised trajectory preferences). It is worth pointing out (as the authors did in the rebuttal) that neither SURF, RUNE, MRN, nor B-Pref (many of which were published on this venue) included actual human-in-the-loop experiments.\n\nFor _W2_, the authors removed the requirement for convex state and actions.

I would also use the extra space could also be used to indicate that the trajectories and the labels are used for reward-learning.\n* The description of the plots in Section 4 (page 5), is far away from the actual plots.\n* Could you add final performance tables for all the experiments. Sometimes it is hard to see which of the methods does better and by how much.\n* For figure 4, could you use a boxplot or a violin plot? It would be interesting to see if there are any spearman correlation outliers in each of the tasks and algorithms.\n* In the Related Work section, I suggest changing \"discovered\" to \"investigated\", to avoid a debate whether algorithms are discovered or invented.\n* In the Related work section, I would incorporate the use of mixup in representation learning and computer vision.\n* The limitations of the method are currently stated as future work.

No analysis with actual human-in-the-loop**  \n\nWe understand the value of including real human annotations in our analysis to further justify the efficacy of MCP. However, we encountered challenges, such as the absence of a publicly verified human annotation protocol and difficulties in controlling other variables for a fair comparison.  \nTo ensure a rigorous and fair evaluation, we followed the practices of numerous established preference-based RL studies [1-4]. These studies typically rely on the B-Pref benchmark [5] for evaluation. The B-Pref benchmark is widely recognized for its ability to simulate human irrationality effectively. We believe that this benchmark provides a suitable and controlled environments for comparing methodologies. It allows us to assess the performance of MCP in a consistent and reliable manner, even without direct human-in-the-loop analysis.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Kimin Lee, Laura M Smith, and Pieter Abbeel.

Proportion of invalid state-action pairs**  \n\nIn considering the assumption of convex states and actions, we concluded that it is not a necessary condition for our method. While the mixed trajectory might not always adhere to real-world convexity, this doesn't negatively impact the network learning. This is similar to the original mixup approach, which interpolates two pairs of image and label that might not represent feasible real-world scenarios. Despite this, mixup has shown considerable robustness against adversarial examples and incorrect labels, largely due to vicinal risk minimization.  \nThe primary benefit of mixup is its capacity to generalize and regularize learning, focusing on the broader data rather than the precise validity of augmented samples based on convexity. Studies that have augmented virtual trajectories also reported significant performance gains without explicitly checking the validity of generated rollouts [1, 2]. Hence, we have decided to remove the assumptions regarding convexity and validity from the proposed method section to address these concerns.  \nNonetheless, we agree that checking the proportion of valid values is also beneficial. We tried to manually set mixed states in the simulator and input them with mixed actions. Unfortunately, the DMControl environments do not offer this functionality. However, in our exploration with the Metaworld environments, specifically the Button Press scenario, we manually set one million mixed transitions from the replay buffer. We found that all mixed actions were feasible at their respective mixed states. This feasibility arises because all actions in Metaworld environments are unconditionally available, and the mixed values fall within the min-max range of spaces.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Yu, T., Lan, C., Zeng, W., Feng, M., Zhang, Z., & Chen, Z.

To address this question, we conducted an ablation study in three environments (Walker, Door Open and Sweep Into) using only mixed preference data. This was done by applying just the second term in Equation (8). Figure 15 depicts the learning curves when using only mixed preference data compared to using both original and mixed preference data. 'Concat (O)' refers the original MCP method using Equation (8), which concatenates original and mixed preferences for learning. On the other hand, 'Concat (X)' indicates MCP trained solely with mixed preference data. Our findings indicate that including original preference data in training leads to marginal performance improvements and faster convergence than training only with mixed preference data. However, it is noteworthy that MCP, when trained solely with mixed preferences, prominently outperforms PEBBLE in two of three environments (Walker and Door Open).  \n___  \n\n### **Q3. How to select the trajectories used for mixup and effect in performance**  \n\nWe do not have a specific process for selecting trajectories for mixup. As described in Algorithm 1 in Appendix B, within a given preference batch, each preference instance is mixed with another randomly chosen instance from the same batch. This implies that any sampling strategy, such as uncertainty-based sampling, influences only the selection of trajectories for annotation (same as PEBBLE), not the selection of trajectories for mixing within the batch.  \n___  \n\n### **Q4. Role and value selection of Beta distribution**  \n\nWe employed the Beta distribution for sampling the mixup ratio, following the approach in the original mixup paper [1]. For $\\lambda \\sim Beta(\\alpha,\\alpha)$, $\\lambda$ tends toward extreme values (either 0 or 1) as $\\alpha$ decreases. It leads to a mix that heavily favors one of the original trajectories. Conversely, a higher $\\alpha$ results in a more balanced interpolation of the two trajectories. Because the optimal $\\alpha$ might differ across domains, we conducted hyperparameter searches for DMControl and Metaworld. The results are described in Table 6 in Appendix D.3.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Hongyi Zhang, Moustapha Cisse, Yann N Dauphin, and David Lopez-Paz. mixup: Beyond empirical risk minimization.

                        "value": "Thank you for your detailed rebuttal and for the additional experiments you have carried out. In what follows, I will address the specific points we were discussing.\n\n-----\n\n**W1. No analysis with actual human-in-the-loop.**\n\nThough I strongly empathise with the difficulty of verifying with actual humans-in-the-loop, I still think this paper would greatly benefit from such experiments. It is, for instance, conceivable that MCP performs better with actual humans than scripted teachers, we just do not know. \n\nI disagree that \"_B-Pref benchmark is widely recognized for its ability to simulate human irrationality effectively_\" , since B-Pref authors' stated that: (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ps95-mkHF_&noteId=KYlCUFmG0re)\n\n> \"chances are that none of the biases in our simulated teachers perfectly correlate with real human behavior (rather, human behavior is explained by some combination of some aspects of these with others that we do not yet model in the benchmark)\"\n\nMy understanding is that B-Pref is merely an proxy for actual human behaviour.\n\nHowever, the authors are correct that SURF, RUNE, MRN, and B-Pref did not contain actual human-in-the-loop experiments and still got accepted. I will update my review to indicate this, in case the AC disagrees on the need of actual human-in-the-loop experiments.\n\n**W2. Necessity of convexity assumption**\n\nBased on the empirical results, I agree that convexity is not necessary for MCP. The updated manuscript reads well on this respect.\n\nLikewise, I appreciate that the authors have listed the two main advantages of mixup (robustness and feedback efficiency) in section 3.\n\n\n**Q1. Proportion of invalid state-action pairs**\n\nThank you for trying to check the proportion of valid states in DMC, it is unfortunate that the functionality is not available. That said, I suggest adding the Button Press investigation to the appendix. It might allay the suspicions of readers regarding state feasibility.\n\n**Q2. Ablation study with the original trajectories**\n\nThank you for running this experiment. In retrospect, it is not surprising that most of the benefit comes from the interpolated trajectories and preferences (mixup on images has the same behaviour), but it is interesting to see it confirmed here.\n\nAs a nitpick, the caption of figure 15 does not explain the terms `Concat (O)` nor  `Concat (X)`. Please fix it.\n\n**Q3. How to select the trajectories used for mixup and effect in performance**\n\nThis makes sense, I would still update the manuscript to indicate the type of sampling you are using (presumably, uncertainty-based sampling following PEBBLE). \n\nI still suspect that other sampling trajectories may negatively affect MCP, since the within-the-batch variety directly affects the space of interpolated trajectories. However, this is a minor point, since any change in sampling strategy is going to affect foremost the usefulness of the labelled preferences anyway.\n\n**Q4. Role and value selection of Beta distribution**\n\nThank you for the explanation and for pointing me to Table 6 in the appendix, I missed this during the original review. \n\nIn Appendix A, It may be worth further clarifying the behaviour of the distribution as $\\alpha$ decreases. Currently, the text only states what happens as $\\alpha$ increases, but not as it decreases.\n\n------\n\nBased on the fact that most of my questions and one of the weaknesses have been addressed, I will increase my review rating to a 6. \n\nThat said, I still encourage the authors to incorporate the suggestions from the original review (such as vector graphics and violin plots for figure 4)."

I originally was worried that the authors are the labellers, which could lead to unconscious bias. In this case, this is likely irrelevant since both PEBBLE and MCP share annotations. If concern 2 was addressed however, this could become an issue. Additionally, the authors would be considered experts, which diminishes the impact of these results (after all the potential of PbRL is to allow non-experts to train complex systems).\n2. All the annotations come from the unsupervised trajectory buffer. This is not strictly what PEBBLE does (which selects trajectories from the replay buffer at different times during training based on uncertainty). It would have been preferable to simply replace PEBBLE's scripted teacher with an human teacher, and thus select trajectories to annotate at multiple points during training.\n3. The only quantitative result is in a graph. A table with final values and standard deviation would have been preferable as it would have made it easier to put the numbers into context.\n4. There is no qualitative comparison with the scripted teacher. These should be included for both MCP and PEBBLE.\n5. No information demographic information about the labellers, nor about the amount of time needed to label the trajectories was included.\n\nThat said the videos attached are very promising, so I advise the authors not to get discouraged and to continue working to address these concerns (regardless of the final outcome of the review)."

Mixed-up values in each dimension could lie in *valid* state and action space because their value would lie between the min and max value of spaces, but as a whole, it's very unlikely that the state and action would be valid state and actions. For instance, linear combination of two proprioceptive states of 7-dof arm is very likely to lead to physically infeasible joint positions, and there's no guarantee that it'll be meaningfully connected to linear combination of labels. Without thorough investigation and support in this point, it's very difficult to justify the usage of method in many cases.\n- Also the main weakness is that a lot of experimental results are not statistically significant, and the improvements over PEBBLE and SURF are very weak. At least the number of seed should be significantly increased and also other metrics from [rliable](https://github.com/google-research/rliable) could be considered."

We respond each comment in detail one by one as below.  \n___  \n\n### **Q1. How mixup improves performance and robustness?**  \n\nThe negative impact of corrupted preference data is that it can lead to reward estimator that misinterprets user intentions, causing the agent to act inappropriately. Mixing preference data makes it more difficult to merely memorize the corrupted data, acting as a form of regularization [1]. The second benefit is that MCP improves data efficiency by creating unlimited new data, leading to a smoother reward distribution and enhanced generalization. Lastly, it also mitigates overconfidence problem [2], which can hinder the reward estimator learning. Without mixup, training with binary preference labels using binary cross entropy loss might cause significant reward divergence between two trajectories. This happens due to the tendency to assign overly low rewards to non-preferred trajectories (minimizing the likelihood of selecting non-preferred trajectories) and overly high rewards to preferred  trajectories (maximizing the likelihood of selecting preferred trajectories). MCP adjusts for this imbalance in trajectory valuation. To evaluate MCP's confidence calibration, we additionally report the reliability diagram and expected calibration error [3] in Appendix D.6 and Figure 16.  \n\nReferences  \n[1] Zhang, H., Cisse, M., Dauphin, Y.

Invalidity concerns about mixed state-action**  \n\nWe acknowledge that mixup-augmented data might lead to infeasible state-action pairs in complex real-world problems. However, our findings indicate that these interpolations, even if not entirely feasible in real world, do not hinder the reward estimator learning. This is similar to how the original mixup works by interpolating images and labels, which might not always result in realistic images. Still, the mixup has been effective in enhancing robustness against adversarial examples and incorrect labels, as well as improving data efficiency through vicinal risk minimization.  \nThe key aspect of mixup lies in its generalization for the network's learning process, as mentioned in the previous question. This prevents the network from merely memorizing the whole data, rather than the strict validity of augmented samples. Furthermore, other studies that create virtual trajectories without verifying their real-world validity have also reported significant performance enhancements [1, 2]. In response to the reviewer's concerns, we have removed the convex and validity assumption in the proposed method section.\n\nReferences  \n[1] Yu, T., Lan, C., Zeng, W., Feng, M., Zhang, Z., & Chen, Z.

To address the concerns about statistical significance, we have now incorporated metrics from rliable library [1]. We have included these additional metrics in our analysis, including the interquartile mean and optimality gap, which can be found in Appendix D.4 and Figure 14. This approach provides a more comprehensive assessment of our method's performance compared to PEBBLE and SURF.  \nIn our pursuit of statistically significant comparison, we conducted ten independent runs per each experiment, as is standard in studies like PEBBLE [2] and MRN [3]. This number of runs is double that used by SURF [4] and RUNE [5]. Note that in the field of deep RL, 3-10 runs are typical due to computational constraints. Also, the metrics used in rliable are designed to address such challenge, providing reliable estimates even with a limited number of runs.\n\nReferences  \n[1] Rishabh Agarwal, Max Schwarzer, Pablo Samuel Castro, Aaron C Courville, and Marc Bellemare.  \nDeep reinforcement learning at the edge of the statistical precipice.

                        "value": "Thanks for the response and updating the draft to reflect the comments. I can see that the proposed method somehow works given its performance, but can't recommend this paper to be accepted yet. I'm willing to update my score to 5, but keeping my current score of 3 to avoid making unnecessary borderline rating -- will update the final score after the internal discussion. This is because the current paper is not providing enough support and analysis why it can be useful and when it can be harmful due to its strong augmentation that can make state and actions not be valid. I think the paper still needs to largely improve in this point by providing more experiments and analysis in diverse domains with different setups (e.g., both state and pixels, different environments where the mixup makes sense and not, ..).  I also agree with other reviewers that the paper need human-in-the-loop experiments. For instance, see [Kim et al., 2023] that showed synthetic labels -- even with some synthetic noises from benchmarks like B-pref -- can give different trends and interpretations when compared to human labels. \n\n[Kim et al., 2023] Kim, Changyeon, Jongjin Park, Jinwoo Shin, Honglak Lee, Pieter Abbeel, and Kimin Lee. \"Preference transformer: Modeling human preferences using transformers for RL.\" ICLR 2023"
