                    "value": "Although this paper proposes a unified framework as the foundation for both generative and discriminative models, I can't see a significant difference between the proposed model and the existing energy-based model. Comparing Eq(4) and Eq(5), the only change is the modeling of the energy function, where the proposed model is expected to output a positive value due to the log function, and the author doesn't give a clear explanation about the motivation behind this. In fact, a discussion about the connection between these two models, including the descriptive model, could also be found as early as in [1][2][3], which is missed in the related work. Furthermore, the experiment results in Table 2 and Table 3 are not very impressive, especially compared with recent energy-based models or score-based models like [4][5]. Additionally, there are some recent and important EBM baseline methods missing in Table 3. For example, CoopFlow [6], VAEBM [7], CoopNet [8], CoopVAEBM [9], FEC [10] are important energy-based generative models that the author might consider to compare with. \n\nExcept for this, I also have some comments for the bad organization:\n1.

                    "value": "Overall it is evident that the clarity of the manuscript require significant enhancements. While the motivation to connect to classical mechanics is admirable,  there are several concerns regarding the current state of the manuscript.\n\nTo begin with, the motivation, although rooted in classical mechanics, seems to be at best only remotely related to the actual proposed frame.  I acknowledge that I may not be familiar with all related literature, yet I find the proposed formulas pretty perplexing, despite reasonable effort to understand:\n\n1. For discrmitative model, the proposed equation 5 seems to diverge form the conventional wisdom regarding the energy-based models in using the exponential of energy, which is in equation 4. The rationale and implications behind this bold decision, which deserves a detailed explanation, remain ambiguous.\n\n2. For generative models, the proposed equation 17 and 18 seem to be overly simplified renderings of score-based models into the central field fashion.  The validity of such simplifications is questionable.\n\nMoreover, the manuscript falls short in dealing with the connection between the proposed framework and the actual training/inference. as well as showing experimental setups. This omission makes it hard to objectively evaluate this work's metric, and constrains readers from gleaning meaningful takeaways. Doing so diminishes the potential impact.\n\nLastly, the scope and depth of the experiments presented are somewhat restrictive. I do recognize the effort in providing visual results, but I'm afraid that insufficient clarification hurts their demonstrative value."
