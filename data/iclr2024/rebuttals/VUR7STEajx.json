But here which part is masked? since there are multiple modalities, is it modality-specific masking? or others? have the authors experimented with any varieties of masking strategies? \n\n\"The genomics data, sourced from SNPs, was encoded to display only the minor and major allele in the sequence.\" what does this mean? every sample has both minor and major alleles? That does not make sense? \n\nIt would be great for the authors to give an exact example of what the input looks like. \n\nIs there ablations on which modality is most useful? For example, is genetics useful at all since some works have shown that EHR information overrides with genetics signals. \n\nAlso, why are only 700 SNPs used? there are 800K genotyped SNPs, if not considering imputed arrays. These could be used for pre-training. \n\nThe authors used MMD disease as the prediction task. The data curation is also based on this task, which is limited.\n\nThere are many pre-trained foundation models for each modality, why not use them? but to train itself?\n\nWhat are clusters in the Figure 2 and 3? There are little information with the current set of labels. Could the authors change to other more meaningful labels? \n\nWhat is \"Mean Absolute Percentage Error\"? \n\nWhy do AUROC and AUPRC differ so much? For example in Table 4, E10-14, XGB has 0.859 the best AUROC but 0.162 worst AUPRC?"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer e4Cc, \n\nThank you for your valuable feedback, which has significantly contributed to the refinement of our paper. \n\nWe have provided a revised version of the paper; for an overview of the changes, please refer to the general rebuttal. \n\n\nIn addressing the points you raised: \n\n1. and 2. We have tried to enhance the clarity of our paper by rephrasing critical sections. Additionally, we have included comprehensive explanations in the appendix, detailing pivotal aspects like tokenization, ablations, and feature extraction processes. \n\n3. The addition of an \"Ablations\" section is intended to provide a more systematic evaluation. Our approach to managing different modalities is informed by contemporary studies on multi-modal transformers, as detailed in the referenced review ( Xu, Peng, Xiatian Zhu, and David A. Clifton. \"Multimodal learning with transformers: A survey.\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2023). ).  Furthermore, the applicability of BERT-like models for Electronic Health Records (EHR) data is supported by existing research such as Rasmy, Laila, et al. \"Med-BERT: pretrained contextualized embeddings on large-scale structured electronic health records for disease prediction.\" NPJ digital medicine 4.1 (2021): 86. \n\n \n\nAddressing your queries: \n\n1. We selected a BERT-based model due to existing research that has demonstrated its effectiveness. Investigating alternative transformer models as baselines could be a valuable direction for future research. \n\n2. We have updated the appendix with a new section to elucidate the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objectives, which were previously unclear. This section explains the dual application of the MLM objective: firstly, in pretraining the encoder for each modality with modality-specific token sequences, and secondly, in jointly training the four encoders with the decoder. In this latter phase, masking is exclusively applied to the decoder\u2019s sequence, and correspondingly, the calculation of the MLM loss is confined to the decoder's output. \n\n3. We have corrected the error concerning the SNPs in the tokenization section in our paper, thanks to your observation, and have updated the respective paragraph to ensure its accuracy. \n\n4. Recognizing the unconventional nature of our tokenization approach, we have expanded the tokenization section in the appendix with a detailed example to help better comprehension. \n\n5. An \"Ablations\" section has been added to the appendix, presenting an in-depth exploration of how key components influence model performance. \n\n6. The choice of SNPs was based on their confirmed relation to Major Depressive: The choice of SNPs was motivated by their already established role to MDD, as our current model is not intended for SNP discovery at GWAS scale, such as linear mixed models, but to support cross-modal fusion and interpretation. We acknowledge the limitations imposed by computational constraints on the number of SNPs included. The ablations section offers insights into the minimal contribution of the genetic modality to overall performance. Future research could focus on better incorporating this genetic modality to enhance its effectiveness. \n\n7. We apologize for any confusion and have clarified that only the genetics profile is specifically curated for MDD, not the broader UK BioBank data. \n\n8. For the genetics encoder, exploring other pretrained foundation models could be beneficial. However, the uniqueness of other modalities to the UK BioBank data limits the applicability of foundation models trained on different datasets, such as MIMIC-VI. \n\n9. We have updated the legends and captions of relevant figures to enhance their clarity and comprehensiveness. \n\n10. We have revised the caption of 'Table 5: Performance Metrics for Regression Tasks' to include the definition of the MAPE acronym, standing for Mean Absolute Percentage Error. In our paper, we utilize MAPE as a standard metric for regression tasks. To briefly explain MAPE here, it measures the absolute error as a percentage of actual values. \n\n11. The use of different metrics, such as AUPRC (Area Under the Precision Recall Curve), is particularly relevant in our case due to the heavily imbalanced nature of our datasets (as detailed in \"Table 3: Statistics of Datasets for fine-tuning\"). AUPRC is a more suitable metric for performance evaluation in such scenarios; see Saito, Takaya, and Marc Rehmsmeier. \"The precision-recall plot is more informative than the ROC plot when evaluating binary classifiers on imbalanced datasets.\" PloS one 10.3 (2015): e0118432. \n\n \n\nWe hope these revisions and explanations address your concerns and enhance the quality of our paper. Should you have any further suggestions or questions, please feel free to ask."

In the context of health, it is often important for models to be investigated for their usage around specific usage criterion. The results are promising in these sections."

Apart from XGB the selected baselines are rather weak. Even for the selected baselines, the feature selection and processing should be discussed in more details\n- The method description is rather convoluted and difficult to follow. The main claim of the architecture is rather muddied and difficult to review for importance\n- The modalities while discussed in the beginning is under-analyzed in terms of their contribution for predictive/modeling performance. The authors should consider ablation of modalities"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer aX8N, \n\nThank you for your insightful feedback and constructive critiques.  \n\nWe have provided a revised version of the paper; for an overview of the changes, please refer to the general rebuttal. \n\nIn response to the concerns raised: \n\n1. We appreciate your emphasis on the necessity for baseline models. Following your guidance, we have incorporated the missing baseline models pertinent to both regression and classification tasks. It's important to note that the inclusion of these models did not alter the previously reported best metrics results. We intentionally chose baseline models that are commonly used in healthcare settings, but we recognize the possibility of including additional models in subsequent studies. To enhance transparency, we have appended a detailed explanation of our feature selection method for these baseline models in the appendix. \n\n2. To clarify our methodology, we have revised the relevant sections to ensure a more coherent and accessible presentation of our methods. We have also incorporated a concise statement of goals in the introduction for clearer understanding. \n\n3. Acknowledging the importance of understanding the individual contributions of different modalities, we have included an \"Ablations\" section in the appendix. This section investigates the impact of each modality in two distinct scenarios: firstly, when a single modality supplements the disease sequences, and secondly, when one modality is excluded from the final fpM-BioBERTa architecture. \n\n\nAddressing your queries: \n\n1. We regret any ambiguity in our first explanation about embedding methods and revised the relevant paragraph in the temporal embedding section. To clarify, our approach integrates all embedding methodologies of RoBERTa, including token type embedding and learned positional embedding, in conjunction with temporal embedding. We have opted for learned positional embedding instead of cosine embedding, aligning with current trends in the field. \n\n2. In response to your request for greater clarity, we have revised the relevant paragraph for better comprehension. Additionally, we have updated Figure 1 to depict the information flow more accurately, specifically into the modality-specific cross-attention layers from the self-attention output. \n\nWe hope these modifications and clarifications adequately address your concerns and enhance the comprehensibility of our work. Should you have any further suggestions or questions, please feel free to ask."
