Unfortunately, it not novel and has been previously suggested in [1].\n\n- Nevertheless, the idea to use control theory---and notions of controllability/reachability in particular---to analyze LLMs is quite elegant. \n\n- The paper asks a number of interesting questions in section 7. \n\n[1] Soatto, Stefano, et al. \"Taming AI Bots: Controllability of Neural States in Large Language Models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.18449 (2023)."

                    "value": "- It is not clear that the analysis in section 4 is of any relevance as it stands for two reasons:\n 1)  I am not sure it makes sense to give a \"topological/norm/metric\" controllability condition as in (4). Is there a natural topology here to justify this? As far as I understand tokenization imposes a more or less arbitrary choice of topology so it is not clear to me that characterizing controllability (an algebraic concept) by a topological one makes any sense. \n2) Moreover, I cannot find any suggestion in the paper that the bound is of any practical use---here the obvious questions is: is it sharp and if not how loose?\n\n- Control theory is fundamentally a study of dynamical systems. The statement that \" For simplicity, the time set T and the transition map \u03d5 are omitted from this\ndefinition\" made in section 3 then suggests that you are actually no longer really in the realm of control---which was your main selling point to begin with.\n\n\n- The experiments are somewhat sparringly commented and the reader is left wondering how these were conducted. What is the precise definition of a \"solved instance\" and how were these instances generated? My critique pertains to section 6 mainly but the appendix also suffers from uncommented plots.\n\n- While satisfactory, the level of writing could be better. There are a number of grammatical errors, but beyond that and more importantly, the paper does not feel very well structured. I think this is due in part to a lack of clear delineation of what the paper's contribution is. \n\n- It would be better if the analysis was stated in standard thm/proof style. Currently, commentary is interwoven with the proof of claim (4) making the derivation unnecessarily obtuse. Ideally, the proof should be prefaced by exactly that which is to be shown and then broken down into an overview of the relevant components, followed by the proof itself. Let me finally say that I find this particularly strange since the paper has a number of definitions (potentially too many...) stated in the standard mathematical style."

The relationship between state controllability (Definition 7) and $k-\\epsilon$ controllability (Definition 6) should be discussed, i.e., implications of your theory result in Section 4. In addition, I am confused about some notations: are $u_i$, $x_i$ the embeddings of the tokens? Previously the u and x are presented as tokens, it does not make sense to make $\\|u_i\\|\\le 1$ and $\\|x_i\\| \\le 1$ if they are tokens. In addition, is this assumption valid in real LLMs? \n\n\nAlthough introducing the controllability of LLM from a control perspective is interesting, the experimental results of checking the controllability of the LLMs are not very exciting given the existing results from previous work [Zou 2023]. The experiment setup is almost identical to GCG work and the obtained results are also within expectation. Instead, proposing a new method to study the controllability of black-box LLMs will be more interesting."

In particular, I suspect LLMs might be very easily steerable, and that any limitation in the ability to push them to a particular output is just due to limitations in the optimization method that is used to find the prompt. As a noticeable example, one might say that, for the definition of steering that has been employed in the paper, a sufficiently capable LLM can always be steered by prepending to it an prefix that reads like \"after reading n words/token, output this particular word/token\". If the optimization procedure does not find such a solution, it seems more a limitation of that than a fact related to the inability of LLMs to be steered.\n- The paper is at times not well-organized. The discussion section, that is usually a summary of the takeaways from the paper, looks more like a discussion of related work, and also has some incomplete points, the theoretical results would be better understood inside of a theorem latex environment, and so on."

When an LLM is controllable, there exists a prompt capable of compelling the LLM to produce a desired output, even if that output is factually incorrect. Thus, this formulation does not seem to establish a real connection with the specific capabilities of LLM, such as reasoning and knowledge memorization. Moreover, The attribute of controllability appears to lean more towards a negative property, signifying the LLM's susceptibility to prompt manipulation and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n2. The theory only requires the weight matrices to meet a particular bound on their largest eigenvalues. The analysis framework does not depend on any training data or training algorithms. Even randomly generated weights (as long as they satisfy the specific bound) can render the LLM entirely controllable. This raises concerns about whether this theoretical framework can effectively explain the underlying mechanism of a well-trained LLM.\n\n3. The results do not seem to offer practical guidance for prompt design. The analysis does not appear to provide insights into how to stimulate the capabilities of an LLM effectively.

The authors do a thorough review of the state-of-the-art literature on the topic, and introduce the necessary control theoretical concepts. Building on these concepts, the authors introduce the definition of k-\\epsilon controllability, which is a measure of the existence of a \u201cmagic word\u201d (k token prompt) that would lead to the desired output token. The authors present a theoretical result to bound the k-epsilon controllability of the attention head, and two heuristic algorithms that allow to compute magic words. They provide simulation results that show that in 97% of the cases surveyed, \u201cmagic words\u201d exist."

For this reason, the approach introduced in this paper has great potential to advance our understanding of language technologies. This reviewer positively values the originality of this paper. Moreover, the topic addressed of controlling language generation with the appropriate prompt is very relevant, and having rigorous tools opens the door to a formal treatment of LLMs. In this paper, they provide an algorithm to find \u201cmagic words\u201d based on a mathematical result inspired by control theory concepts. More importantly, they list a series of open questions that could be addressed from a control-theoretical point of view."

                    "value": "This paper has some issues with the formalization of the theoretical concepts, as well as with the presentation of the results. Since this paper introduces for the first time control theoretical concepts in the light of LLMs, it is paramount that the definitions are accurate and properly capture the ideas underpinning dynamical systems. This is not the case for this paper. The control theoretical concepts in this paper are not properly communicated, and Definition 4 has several flaws. The definition given corresponds to an input-output system, as opposed to a dynamical system: in order for it to be a dynamical system, the state space should be V as opposed to V^*. Moreover, the definition given for k-\\epsilon controllability is very far the definition of controllability in dynamical systems. Please refer to Feedback Control Systems (Amstrom and Murray, 2009) for details. This reviewer is concerned that, if published in the current form, this paper can introduce more confusion than clarifications in the realm of using control theoretical tools for LLMs analysis. Aside from this, the main result should be framed as a theorem and provided in the body of the paper, together with the algorithms, not in the appendices, as these are the main results of the paper. Furthermore, the paper currently lacks necessary formal definitions (such as the definition of the V^* set), and the control theoretical section lacks clarity in the exposition. Substantial modifications are needed to improve the rigor of the presentation in Sections 3 and 4."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "This reviewer would like to know why the state space is defined as V^* as opposed to V. Defining it in such manner strips away the dynamics of the system (progression with time), and reduces it to an input/output system. This reviewer would also like to know how map \\phi is defined in the context of LLMs, since only h was defined. Since the state space is defined as V^*, the map \\phi cannot properly be defined as the dynamics of the system. Moreover, the question under study is more a question of system excitation under an initial condition than a control input. In the context of control theory, an input is very rarely seen as a one-time excitation, but rather as a feedback signal. The setup described in this paper corresponds to an input/output behavior under an initial condition, and as a result, the definition for k-\\epsilon controllability is very different from the standard controllability definition used in control theory. Moreover, this reviewer suggest the use of \u201creachability\u201d, as opposed to \u201ccontrollability\u201d, as it more accurately captures the problem under consideration."
