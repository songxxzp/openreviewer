It adds additional conditioning branches to two pretrained 2D and 3D diffusion models, and allow them to condition on each other at every step of the diffusion inference process. The model can generate 3D results more faithful to text than simply using a standalone 3D diffusion model, and enables disentangled control of geometry and texture."

In the ablation study of 4.3, only one particular qualitative example is shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of different components. This is far from being convincing. The authors should have included more than 10 results of different prompts in the appendix for that.\n\n2. In the \"bidirectional guidance\" part of section 4.3 Ablation Studies, the results shown at the top row of figure 6 seem to be totally different shapes. I understand this can happen for the 2D diffusion model. However the text also says \"... and the 3D diffusion model manifests anomalies in both texture and geometric constructs.\". But where are the 3D diffusion results? From my understanding the results from the 3D diffusion model should always look like the same shape and yield consistent multi-view renderings. I did not find these results in figure 6.\n\n3. Figure 4 shows the main qualitative results of the proposed feed-forward method. However there is no comparison to previous methods. I think at least the comparison to Shap-E should be included.\n\n4. The results of Zero-1-to-3 shown in figure 5 are weird. Why all the others methods shown are the final 3D results with mesh visualization, but the Zero-1-to-3 only has multi-view generation results? My understanding is to generation the 3D results at the left lower corner of Figure 5, we still need to use the SDS loss. If this is true, then a directly competitor should be using Zero-1-to-3 with SDS loss.\n\n5. More details about the decoupled geometry and texture control in page 8 are needed. What does it mean to fix the 3D prior? Do you mean fixing the initial noise of the 3D diffusion? When fixing the textual prompt if the 2D diffusion, do you also fix the initial noise?"

Why the multi view images generated on the left are low quality and lack details, while the 3D results on the right suddenly have much richer texture and geometry?\n\n2. During training, since we do not have the results of the intermediate denoised results for any particular timestep t, the original GT 3D shape and multi-view images are used as the conditioning signals. I feel this domain gap seems to be a serious problem. Do the authors have any thoughts on eliminating this gap?"

Below are our responses to the main questions by the reviewer.\n\n**1. Problem of separation of shape and texture control.**\n\nPlease refer to Question 1 in interpretation of common questions.\n\n**2. Problem of results in websit.**\n\nSorry for any confusion caused by our video. The results on the left are from the bidirectional diffusion feed-forward sampling, while those on the right are after applying SDS optimization to these results. Please refer to Question 1 in common questions about the gap between the optimized results and the results before optimization.\n\n**3. The domain gap of conditioning signals.**\n\nDuring training, the conditioning signals for the 3D network are noisy multi-view images, not the clean ground-truth ones. At inference time, these conditioning signals are also noisy images, resulting from the previous 2D diffusion step. Therefore, there is no training and inference gap. The conditioning signals for the 2D network are the multi-view images rendered by the 3D network, which are also consistent with inference. \n\nMoreover, using noisy multi-view images does not lead to significant problems. In the early stages of sampling, when noise is relatively high, the 3D network's denoising relies more on the 3D prior, and at this time, the noise-induced uncertainty in 3D structure is acceptable. In the later stages of sampling, the smaller noise hardly affects the generation of 3D structure. Therefore, throughout the entire sampling process, the 2D and 3D representations are denoised synchronously, with bidirectional adjustment at each step to ensure consistency between 2D and 3D.\n\n**4. More results and comparisons.**\n\nWe supplemented more results in revision main paper and supplementary material."

The 3D diffusion model is based on the NeuS representation and incorperates geometric priors from the large scale Shap-E model. The 2D diffusion model is finetuned from DeepFloyd-IF for multi-view image generation. During each diffusion step, the 3D diffusion model takes image features from the prediction of 2D diffusion model, and the 2D diffusion model is further conditioned on the multi-view renderings from the prediction of 3D diffusion model. In this manner, the two models are \"synchonized\" to achieve corherent 3D generation. Compared to previous optimization-based methods, the proposed approach has a lower generation time and the outputs suffer from less multi-face Janus problem."

The later leverages the genealization ability of large scale 2D image model but often suffer from inaccurate geometry (e.g., Janus problem).\n\nThis work takes a step forward by combining the advantage of both --- prior from 3D dataset helps with the geometry and prior from 2D images improves the texture quality.\n\nThe results on the webpage look quite decent."

These are then incorporated as conditions into the 3D diffusion segment, alongside the reference shape produced by ShapE. Conversely, the refined 3D geometry can be rendered back into images to steer the 2D multiview branch. By implementing this approach, the researchers illustrate the model's capability to efficiently produce 2D-3D congruent shapes in several diffusion steps, all within a minute. Tests conducted on the ShapeNet and Objaverse datasets reveal that the introduced method strikes an optimal balance between quality (as indicated by the CLIP score) and generation speed."

Notably, the insights gained from ShapE and stable diffusion are seamlessly and effectively combined.\n\n- Demonstrating speed and efficiency, the method can produce a commendable 3D shape based on textual guidance in just a matter of minutes."

                    "value": "- The paper's presentation lacks a clear focus, with undue emphasis on certain aspects that distract from its main contributions:\n  1. While the authors highlight that their framework allows for the separation of shape and texture control, dedicating an entire page to this feature, it's evident that this separation isn't a core attribute of the proposed model. Instead, it's achieved through modifications in the text prompt and Shap-E guidance, diluting the impact of the claim.\n  2. The authors showcase numerous impressive results achieved via 'optimization-based methods'. However, these results don't stem directly from their proposed pipeline but rather from the optimization methods. There's an insufficient description of these methods in the main content, and they fail to retain the fundamental shape or texture resulting from the bidirectional diffusion model.\n  \n- The strategy for enhancing priors is fundamentally a guidance system that doesn't rely on classifiers. This should be clarified by the authors.\n\n- The quality of the generated results leaves room for improvement. The images appear blurry, making it challenging to discern the specific identity of the produced shape without cross-referencing the associated text prompt, as seen in the iKun example :) Additionally, the generated geometry exhibits numerous striped artifacts. This lack of clarity might stem from inadequate training and diminished resolution in the 3D domain. Employing a different foundational 3D representation might address these issues.\n\n- The paper's writing quality needs enhancement. It contains several typographical errors, grammatical mistakes, and omitted cross-references. For instance, on Page 5, Fig. [] is missing, and on Page 6, the reference to \"$N$ views\" should be corrected to \"$M$ views.\""

What's the rationale behind using SparseConvolution for the 3D diffusion?**\n\nThe use of SparseConv follows SparseNeus. For a 3D cubic grid feature volume, some grid points may not project onto any rendering images. In addition, to reduce computation, some grid points corresponding to edge rays are selectively disabled. Therefore, using SparseConv in our 3D model is more flexible and efficient. The 3D diffusion process begins from sparse volume (grid points). Its initialization method is same as normal diffusion. We can regard the sparse volume as one-dimensional data. $\\mathcal{G}\\_{t\\_0}$ represents a radiance field converted from the Shap-E latent code, specifically expressed as a 3D feature volume of size $s \\times s \\times s$, hence it can use SparseConv for feature mapping or further extraction.\n\n**5. Symbols.**\n\n$\\mathcal{G}\\_{t\\_0}$ represents a radiance field converted from the Shap-E latent representations. It is expressed as a feature of a 3D grid of size $s \\times s \\times s$, hence it can use SparseConv for feature mapping or further extraction. $\\mathcal{V}$ prime represents the sampling result of the network during the denoising process. We want to distinguish it from the ground truth represented by $\\mathcal{V}$ without prime. Prime represents the result output by the network."

(5), $ \\mathcal{G}\\_{t\\_{0}} $ represents a radiance field converted from the Shap-E latent code with $t\\_0$ step noise. To avoid confusion, we have clarified definition of $\\mathcal{G}$ to: We design a feature volume $\\mathcal{G}$ to represent a radiance field converted from the latent code $\\mathcal{C}$. And Section 3.2 of main paper explains the meaning of $t\\_0$: To generate 3D objects beyond Shap-E model, we add Gaussian noise at level $t_0$ to the clean latent code, resulting in the noisy latent representation $\\mathcal{C}\\_{t\\_0}$, where $t\\_0$ represents a predefined constant timestep. Subsequently, the noisy radiance field $\\mathcal{G}\\_{t\\_0}$ is decoded by substituting $\\mathcal{C}$ with $\\mathcal{C}\\_{t\\_0}$. This design establishes a coarse-to-fine relationship between the 3D prior and the ground truth, prompting the 3D diffusion process to leverage the 3D prior without becoming excessively dependent on it."
