(I did not see this explicitly stated in the manuscript, but I am assuming that the dataset will be made publicly available.)\n* **Ablations**: I appreciated the ablation studies for better understanding how the individual components of the proposed method affect the overall performance."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "Despite the strengths of the paper, I believe that its flaws outweigh its strengths at this time. In particular, I believe there are nontrivial issues with the experimental validation, as well as the claims made in terms of methods development. Details below:\n\n* **Claims re: methological novelty:** From my reading of the manuscript, the computational novelty in TAROT consists of (1) using a masked autoencoder for learning representations of cells, and (2) incorporating the \"Developmental\" and \"Gene expression\" cost function regularizers. On the other hand, casting trajectory inference as an optimal transport problem is certainly not novel (see e.g. [1, 2]) and using splines to assemble continuous trajectories has also been done in previous work (e.g. [3]); however, the wording throughout the paper seems to imply that these ideas are also novel (see e.g. the summary of contributions at the end of Section 1). I believe it's important that the authors clarify _exactly_ what their contributions are in terms of methods development here.\n* **Weaknesses in quantitative evaluation metrics:** The metrics used for evaluation in Table 1 seem a bit unfair towards other methods. For example, The GPT-G and GPT-L metrics are essentially evaluating whether each method's results agrees with the prior knowledge that's explicitly built into the TAROT cost function. In other words, the metrics assume that this prior knowledge can be used as a gold-standard ground truth for evaluating trajectories, which isn't so clear-cut to me. For me to be convinced of TAROT's superiority over previous methods, I believe the authors would need to evaluate their methods based on more solid ground truths (e.g. from simulated data, or known developmental trajectories in real-world data as in Fig. 2 of [2]).\n* **Weaknesses in qualitative evaluations:** While appreciate the goal of the authors qualitative evaluations in Section 5.3, I believe again there are issues here that prevent me from concluding that TAROT is superior to previous methods. For example, in the gene pattern identification in Figure 7, the authors note that TAROT captures distinct \"wave\" patterns of gene expression varying over pseudotime (including _non-monotonic patterns_), and conclude that this phenomenon validates TAROT's efficacy. Based on the authors assumption that gene expression should vary _monotonically_ over time, framing this finding as a positive thing seems odd and potentially suggests issues with the metrics noted in my previous point. Other issues include: not including Monocle-3/moscot in the GSEA comparison of Figure 8, not discussing whether the specific pathways found in the GSEA analysis are meaningful/align with biology, and not comparing with any other methods in simulated gene knockout experiments.\n* **Issues with the constructing clusters for the M-RGC dataset:** The construction of the \"cell type\" clusters for the M-RGC dataset is a bit arbitrary, and not entirely grounded in known biology. For example, the authors use $k=50$ neighbors for constructing a nearest-neighbor graph. This choice of $k$ is justified according to the \"experience of biological sciences\", though popular packages like Seurat use other values (e.g. 20 in https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/findneighbors). Similarly, Louvain results are highly sensitive to the choice of resolution parameter, and I could not find discussion anywhere of how this parameter was chosen. Ideally, these clusters should be chosen/validated using known marker genes before using them as ground truths.\n\n[1]: Schiebinger et al. \"Optimal-Transport Analysis of Single-Cell Gene Expression Identifies Developmental Trajectories in Reprogramming\"\n[2]: Klein et al. \"Mapping cells through time and space with moscot\"\n[3] Trapnell et al. \"The dynamics and regulators of cell fate decisions are revealed by pseudotemporal ordering of single cells\"\n\n\nMinor points:\n* **Missing dataset?** The authors mention in the summary of contributions in the introduction that they validate TAROT on the Mouse-RGC dataset and two publicly available datasets, but I only saw one publicly available dataset in the results section (Mouse-CCC).\n* **MCC vs. CCC?** Related to the previous point, the authors alternate between referring to a Mouse-MCC dataset vs. Mouse-CCC dataset, but I only see results for Mouse-CCC in Table 1."

                    "value": "1. The different components of the $\\rm{TAROT}$ algorithm: while there is a benefit in considering the complete pipeline, as suggested in $\\rm{TAROT}$ it is important to acknowledge existing community efforts. See following points.\nRepresentation learning in single-cell genomics: as outlined by the authors (Section 2) much effort has been put to improve the quality of learned cell representation. However, the authors do not utilize an existing tool (which is already optimized for sc-data and usually allows incorporation of prior biological knowledge) nor do they consider any of the existing tools in the presented ablation study (Section 5.4). This limits the ability to judge the optimality of the claim of MAE being a \u201cSuperior cell representation\u201d. \n2. OT application: Similarly to the previous point, as mentioned by the authors application of OT for trajectory inference in single-cell data was already suggested in WOT (Schiebinger et al. 2019) and MOSCOT (Klein et al., 2023). Importantly, all settings consider regularized optimal transport to perform the matching and the difference boils down to the biological priors used to regularize the cost. In $\\rm{TAROT}$  this prior is detailed in the section \u201cBiology Priors Regularize Cost Function\u201d. However, the option to introduce a similar prior in previous frameworks is not mentioned. It is important to note that MOSCOT allows for the computation of OT marginals from proliferation and apoptosis markers in developmental processes to capture the different proliferation and death rates of cells. It will be valuable to add a description of previous methods, stand on the main difference between them and the current approach, and elaborate on the setting chosen to evaluate the baseline, MOSCOT.\n3. Biological priors: the authors define two biological priors used to regularize the cost matrix (1) Developmental and (2) Gene expression. As these stand out as the major contribution of the framework it will be beneficial to provide further details on the construction of these regularizers, e.g. how is the regularization introduced in practice and how was the gene-list constructed.\n4. The entropy regularization parameter ($\\lambda$): the authors acknowledge the importance of the entropy regularization parameter and present a \u201cNon-Linear Entropy Weight Search\u201d procedure used to set it (Algorithm 1). With that, it will be valuable to present ablation with respect to this value, given its importance in the OT setting, or at least report the value used in presented results. \n5. Data and code availability: it will be beneficial to accompany the attached code with the relevant data files. Specifically the mouse-RGC dataset could be a useful resource for the community. \n6. Writing quality: the paper contains many grammatical errors, typos, and misuse of terminology. Hence,  there is a need for comprehensive proofreading and language refinement."
