The method uses a greedy algorithm to select one image per class at a time, based on a score function that considers both representativeness and diversity. The score function is based on submodular optimization, which maximizes the benefit of adding each image to the subset. The method is evaluated on the Pascal VOC dataset and compared with various random selection methods. The method outperforms random selection by a large margin in terms of AP50 when selecting only 200 images. The method also shows its effectiveness on the COCO dataset and different network architectures."

To ensure both representativeness and diversity, this paper proposes submodular optimization, utilizing the representative vectors in this optimization process to select a subset.

The initial term's objective is to select the most representative from those that have not been previously chosen, whereas the latter term aims to select an option distinct from those that have already been selected."

                    "value": "1. The author appears to be the first to propose and investigate this problem, given the absence of comparisons to other methods within this context. However, the methodology lacks rigorousness. The stated objective is to select the most representative subset from a complete dataset. Yet, the paper seems to primarily focus on selecting a subset to enhance the mAP of Faster R-CNN, which is not synonymous. Defining representativity is challenging, as it can vary across different datasets and models.\n\n2. The results presented are not entirely persuasive. Firstly, the author does not compare the work to any other studies, but merely to a few basic counterparts such as random sampling and classwise random sampling. Even if there are no other methods available for object detection, it would be beneficial for the author to compare some classification methods and apply them to object detection.\nSecondly, the paper's main experiments are based on PASCAL VOC, an older and relatively small object detection dataset. This is not particularly convincing as the resources required to train the model on the entire PASCAL VOC are minimal, rendering the selection of a small representative subset from it somewhat redundant.\nAdditionally, as demonstrated in Table 5, the improvement in performance on the COCO dataset is marginal when compared to the random sampling counterpart.\n\n3. The proposed method is succinct yet lacks effectiveness. The paper's primary contribution appears to be exclusively formula (4). As demonstrated in Table 5, its performance modestly surpasses that of the random sampling counter."

To their credit \n\n- Comparison against random selection is kind of vs \"lowest-denominator\"; it would have been nice if the authors could have used some kind of principled alternative, even one as not-for-purpose as using image classifier subset selectors such as they reference.
