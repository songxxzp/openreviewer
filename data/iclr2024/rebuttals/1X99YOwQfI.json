To this end, authors introduce an algorithm that (1) optimize fairness and accuracy objectives simultaneously (2) maintain a user specified preference over fairness and accuracy objectives. To achieve this, the authors suggest using a moving average\tof gradients and gradient magnitude pruning that result in a better estimate of a conflict avoiding direction, and using an additional objective that enforces the compliance of the learned model to a user specified preference. The authors provide empirical results that compares the proposed method with existing Pareto front learning baselines, and show that the proposed algorithm recover a Pareto front that have good properties like better spread and larger hyper-volume."

Thus this paper proposes a method called Controllable Pareto Trade-off (CPT) for achieving diverse and controllable trade-offs between fairness and accuracy for machine learning models. CPT allows precisely controlling the trade-off by following pre-defined reference vectors in the objective space. The claimed contributions of this paper are:\n1) using moving averages of stochastic gradients to approximate full gradients, reducing noise and missing subgroups, and finding the common descent direction without missing subgroups\n2) pruning gradients to reduce dimensionality and enable a more accurate estimation of the common descent direction. \n3. Experiments on toxicity classification show CPT can achieve more diverse Pareto solutions compared to prior methods."

Based on this, I think this paper needs further ethical review. \n- 1.3 To achieve fairness in the downstream task, we only need a final fair model. How is the proposed model applied to real tasks?\n2. The technical contribution is limited and not sound to me. The adopted techniques are all from previous work, such as MGDA and gradient pruning. I think directly adopting an existing technique to a new scenario is acceptable, but combined with Weakness 1, this is questionable.\n3. The presentation of this paper is poor. \n- 3.1 The format of the definition is strange and not formal for a research paper. \n- 3.2 Figure 1 is hard to read since the title and axes are too small. Figure 2 has the same issue.\n4. The experiment is not convincing at all. \n- 4.1 Only one dataset is used. This is not enough to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For the fairness domain, the more commonly used datasets such as tabular data (folktable, German Credit, COMPAS), and image data (CelebA) are not discussed and experimented on.\n- 4.2 Even for Jigsaw, the backbone is also limited. Using a BERT as an encoder and two-layer MLP for classification does not investigate the proposed method well. More backbones such as end-to-end language models should be considered.\n- 4.3 Why only report the loss in Figures 1 and 2? The accuracy metric of the accuracy-fairness trade-off curve should also be presented and investigated.\n5. Minor Question:\n- 5.1 Please show more detail of Equation (3). Since this loss function seems non-differentiable, the paper should present how this loss integrates into the overall loss or is approximately integrated into it.\n- 5.2 In the abstract, this paper said \u201ccombining the two objectives can result in mediocre or extreme solutions\u201d but introduces a third objective in the loss function \u201cthe reference vector and then includes the discrepancy between the reference and the two objectives as the third objective in the rest training\u201d.
