                    "value": "The paper presents a constrained decoding strategy to limit the generative space of large language models, effectively transforming them into retrievers without requiring additional training. This retrieval process is two-fold: initially, the large model generates titles corresponding to relevant documents based on input questions. Subsequently, the model generates paragraphs within these documents that contain the sought-after answers. To alleviate the computational burden associated with generating full paragraphs, the authors introduce a technique where the language model produces prefixes to quickly locate relevant paragraphs. This approach substantially reduces the number of tokens generated by the LLM, thereby achieving computational efficiency. The final output of LLM is generated  based on the comprehension of the identified content obtained above. The authors validate their method through experiments on six KILT benchmarks tailored for knowledge-sensitive tasks. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance across the majority of these benchmarks."

                    "value": "- Despite the authors' efforts to enhance computational efficiency through the use of shorter prefixes and the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm for passage location, the proposed LLM2GR model still necessitates at least three forward computations.  This computational burden remains a significant hindrance to its practical applicability.\n- The comparison between LLM2GR and existing methods such as Dense Retriever (DPR), BM25, and Contriever raises questions of fairness. Specifically, LLM2GR employs a considerably more powerful LLM for generative tasks, which inherently skews the comparison with baselines of lesser model capacity. Using an LLM for retrieval is not inherently novel. A more equitable evaluation might involve integrating LLMs with existing retrieval methods\u2014such as DPR\u2014to compare generative capabilities. For instance, one could employ DPR for retrieval and then use an LLM for the generative task based on the retrieved results, thus providing a fairer baseline for comparison. If the proposed two-staged method can still deliver better results, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- Writing Errors: There are typographical errors in the manuscript, such as in Section 2.3 where the phrase \"generate related contexts for \"retrieval,\"\" is incorrectly punctuated. Additionally, the usage of quotation marks throughout the paper is inconsistent.\n- A significant limitation of the proposed method is its dependence on the universal knowledge gained during the pretraining stage. This raises questions about the method's applicability in scenarios that go beyond the scope of Wikipedia or in specialized vertical fields such as medicine or economics. The paper does not address how the method could be adapted or if it remains effective when applied to these more specialized domains. This limitation is a critical factor that constrains my enthusiasm for strongly recommending the paper for acceptance.\n- While the paper convincingly demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used for retrieval, it lacks an in-depth discussion on why LLMs can perform this task effectively. Is it because the models have been exposed to the documents during the pre-training phase?"

Here a question arises that if the text prefix $p_s$ is equal to the final retrieved passage $p_final = d[st : st + l_p]$?\n- Regarding the slow generation speed of the LLM, the authors should explore techniques like 8-bit or 4-bit quantization to assess whether such methods can accelerate the model's performance to an acceptable level, while also evaluating the trade-off in retrieval accuracy."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your careful review!\n\n**W1: The trade-off of two-stage method and speed consideration**\n\nThe two-stage method does require two forward passes, but by generating short snippets instead of one long passage at a time, we can still greatly reduce the time consumption compared to single-stage methods. Due to the current difficulty for LLMs to directly recall fine-grained passages, we adopted the trade-off of using a two-stage approach.\n\n**W2: Differences from combining existing LLMs and traditional retrieval like DPR**\n\nThere are many studies trying to combine LLM generation with traditional methods like DPR, which is similar to using retrieval tools. Our method aims to explore a completely new paradigm of performing retrieval solely based on the capabilities of LLMs themselves, without needing external tools. We think these two lines of work are actually parallel, and prompting LLMs to mimic human recall itself to accomplish retrieval has unique significance. We also reproduced the query2doc (Wang et al.,2023) method of generating for retrieval enhancement using the same hyperparameters on NQ and WOW datasets.\n\n| Method | Page-level NQ | Page-level WOW | passage-level NQ | passage-level WOW |  \n|-|-|-|-|-|\n| bm25 | 26.33 | 28.78 | 23.65 | 50.36 |\n| query2doc+bm25 | 47.55 | 48.49 | 41.42 | 62.02 |\n| LLM2GR | 57.77 | 57.63 | 40.82 | 63.43 |\n\nThe query2doc method enhances retrieval by prompting LLM to generate virtual document. We see significant improvements over bm25. However, our method can still achieve better page-level results using LLMs alone, and competitive passage-level results. \n\nIn addition, query2doc takes ~430 minutes on NQ while our LLM2GR only needs 150 minutes.\n\n**W3: Writing issues**\n\nThank you for pointing out the writing issues, we will make corresponding modifications!\n\n**W4: Other domain**\n\nCurrently our method is only experimented on Wikipedia data, because LLMs are mostly trained on general domain data like Wikipedia during pre-training, while their performance is inferior on some vertical domains which they are not sufficiently trained on. We fully agree on the importance of applying LLM retrieval to various vertical domains, but this is a limitation of our current method. Continued exploration is needed on incorporating new domain documents more effectively, and instruction tuning to activate stronger recall.\n\n**W5: Memorization during pre-training**\n\nWe think the main reason our method works is because during pre-training LLMs are exposed to large amounts of documents, so like humans after reading many books, LLMs also remember some document details. This allows us to activate recall of relevant snippets directly through prompting, and ensure factuality via indexed constraints.\n\n**Q1: Prefix length** \n\nHere we set the prefix length much smaller than the final length, 16 vs 150. So few cases will have identical prefix and final lengths. When the prefix is at the end, we will still extract from the end back to the prefix, which does not impact performance significantly.\n\n**Q2: Quantization methods**\n\nWe fully agree that model quantization can greatly improve the speed of LLM generative retrieval, but since our paper focuses on the retrieval approach itself, we did not specifically consider quantized models. Analyzing the combination in the future is an interesting research direction! But model quantization is orthogonal to our short prefix generation method, and can potentially further improve our current approach."

                    "value": "The major three concerns I have are as follows:\n1. Limited technical contributions and novelties \n2. Missing important baselines\n3. Unsupported claims \n\n**1. Limited technical contributions and novelties**\n\nGenerative retrieval methods have been actively studied, and generating full evidence paragraphs (Yu et al., 2023), URLs (Ziems et al., 2023), Wikipedia titles (De Cao et al., 2020), or substrings (Bevilacqua et al., 2022) have been explored. Bevilacqua et al. (2022) generate substrings, which are similar to short prefix generations, and use the FM-Index to constrain the autoregressive generations. It is not discussed in depth how this work is different from Bevilacqua et al. (2022). One difference might be prompting an LM  rather than fine-tuning. Yet, if the novelty is mostly prompting a larger LM rather than fine-tuning a smaller LM, I think it is not a sufficient contribution for ICLR. \n\n**2. Missing important baselines**\n\nDespite that the proposed method is a new generative retrieval method, none of the baselines is generative retrieval. Several prior works including Bevilacqua et al. (2022) or Yu et al. (2023) are tested on KILT or open-domain QA datasets and are open-source, and I wonder why the authors did not directly compare their method with such prior work. \n\n\n**3. Unsupported claims**\n\nSeveral advantages mentioned in the introduction or the related work section have not been validated by experimental results. For instance,\n\n- *The process of generating complete passages can be overly time-consuming, posing a significant drawback to their practical implementation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach termed Short Prefix Generation and Location (SPGL).*  \n\nIf the authors claim this method is more efficient for practical application by generating less (but searching over FM Index & locating prefixes via KMP), the authors should benchmark inference time latency. Given the complex pipeline of the proposed method and active research of fast inference (e.g., speculative decoding, paged attentions), I am unsure whether this method is indeed practical by skipping longer generations or taking more time due to the expensive search process. Related to the previous point discussed above, the authors should benchmark other generative retrieval methods and quantitatively show the proposed method's effectiveness. \n\n- *Recently, Ziems et al. (2023) have proposed using the large language model GPT-3 to retrieve documents by generating document URLs. However, this method can only be applied to documents retrievable by URLs*\n\nThe proposed method is also limited to the pre-processed Wikipedia corpus as it matches the generated sequences with all titles in DB, which means that the proposed method's search space is also limited by existing Wikipedia titles. For me the difference between the form of URLs v.s. titles does not matter if you only test on Wikipedia, as in Wikipedia converting title into URLs can be achieved by simple text postprocessing most of the time. \n\nYu, Wenhao, et al. \"Generate rather than retrieve: Large language models are strong context generators.\" ICLR (2023)."

Constrained decoding solves the hallucination problem of directly generating using LLMs in Yu et al. (2023). It also addresses the inferior performance of Ziems et al. (2023) on smaller LLMs. \n\nThe key difference from SEAL(Bevilacqua et al., 2022) is that we rely on the capability of LLMs themselves to determine the start positions of fine-grained snippets, instead of generating part of pre-segmented passages to finish retrieval, which introduces much more difficulty. But we believe this retrieval idea will have greater flexibility in the future.\n\n**W2: Comparison with other generative retrieval baseline**\n\nSince all components of Yu et al. (2023) are implemented using closed APIs, direct comparison with our method using open-source LLMs like llama would be very unfair. For llm-url we reproduced results using the same hyperparameters and llama2 13b on NQ and WOW datasets.\n\n| Method | Page-level NQ | Page-level WOW | passage-level NQ | passage-level WOW |\n|-|-|-|-|-|  \n| bm25 | 26.33 | 28.78 | 23.65 | 50.36 |\n| DPR | 54.74 | 26.62 | 47.94 | 45.38 |\n| SEAL | 64.15 | 50.49 | 44.94 | 62.08 | \n| llm-url+bm25 | - | - | 19.67 | 43.09 |\n| LLM2GR | 57.77 | 57.63 | 40.82 | 63.43 |\n\nThe trained SEAL method has been greatly improved compared to dense retrieval methods, showing the effectiveness of generative retrieval through internal model interactions. Note that both SEAL and DPR require extensive training, while our method can achieve competitive results in zero-shot settings by prompting LLMs.\n\nThe llm-url method generates Wikipedia URLs using LLMs. Since it is hard to directly map to KILT benchmark documents, we only provided passage-level results. We found llama2 13b can only generate valid urls with efficacy of 39.5% and 45.2% on the two datasets. This makes it hard to generate sufficient accurate URLs to achieve effective results when using smaller LLMs. Our method can achieve competitive results using smaller open-source LLMs with prompting and constrained decoding, which will facilitate the real-world application of generative retrieval.\n\n**W3: Using faster decoding methods**\n\nWe think using faster decoding methods is actually orthogonal to our current approach. Combined with faster LLM inference in the future, our existing method will lead to faster generative retrieval. Since our method focuses more on the retrieval performance itself, we did not incorporate fast model inference. However, designing specialized accelerating algorithms for generative retrieval is an interesting future direction.\n\n**Q1/Q2: Inference latency**\n\nAs analyzed in the ablation study in Section 4.3, our method takes about 150 minutes on the NQ dataset, dense retrieval takes about 20 minutes, and the generative retrieval method SEAL needs about 11 minutes, llm-url takes about 1700 minutes to generate URLs. Currently due to the expensive cost of LLMs, the time is still far more than traditional fine-tuning of small models. Further optimizing the speed of generative retrieval is crucial."

Two scores resulting from both stages are linearly interpolated to finally rank passages. Furthermore, this paper proposes a short prefix generation and location (SPGL) to efficiently locate and extract a relatively long passage. In SPGL, instead of generating a full content of a passage, its prefix is first generated and then the remaining content of the passage is just located based on KMP string matching algorithm. Under SPGL, the score of the second stage is now replaced with the score of generating only prefix (not the score of the full content). Experiment results using LLMs of llama 7b~13b show that the proposed two-stage generative retrieval often outperforms the fully-finetuned DPR method in TriviaQA, HotpotQA, FEVER, and WoW datasets, demonstrating its promisingness. Ablation studies show that the first stage is vital and the prefix-based score is better than the score using the full content."

The kind of simpler method needs to be considered and adopted as the baseline for the comparison.\n- It seems that the baselines are weak. In the fully-finetuned case, not only DPR but also the reranking method needs to be provided, as the LLM generates the passages based on a stronger attention-based interaction between a question and a document, than the DRP that uses the inner product between dense vectors. \n- The retrieval performance was only compared with previous dense and sparse retrieval methods, lack of comparison with recent generative retrieval methods.\n- In the proposed method, only zero-shot settings are presented. Few-shot settings of LLM need to also be provided. \nUnder few-shot prompts, other LLM-based method such as query2doc could be compared. \nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.07678.pdf\n- Other popular datasets are not considered for evaluation, such as MS MARCO, TREC DL 19, and TREC DL 20. To convincingly validate the proposed zero-shot retrieval of LLM, the work needs to provide a full comparison on more IR collections. \n- The construction of FM-index after the first stage seems to be done per a query. Its computational overhead is not fully discussed. Why FM-index is not constructed over the full documents, towards a manner of restricting a full FM-index to the only restricted top-k documents. \n-  The proposed SPGL approach first generates short prefix of the document and then matches the prefix with document fragments using KMP algorithm. It is much faster than directly generating the whole document using LLM, however, whether this approach has a speed advantage over other generative retrieval works was not discussed. Many generative retrieval works also do not directly generate the documents, such as in SEAL [1], where n-grams of documents are generated first and then using a scoring function to determine the documents. The reviewers would like to know if SPGL is faster compared to other generative retrieval works.\n- In section 3.3, the selection method of the unique documents (from document set) and prefix (from multiple prefixes) is na\u00efve. Although in the vast majority of cases the \u201ctop k document\u201d was unique in this dataset, the method of \u201cdefault choice\u201d does not have any ranking or selection capabilities in the case of extending this work to larger corpus or practical applications."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your careful review!\n\n**W1: Single-stage method**\n\nIn the ablation experiment in Section 4.3 of our paper, we compared the single-stage generation method of large language model based generative retrieval, i.e. the method without the first stage. In this setting, we directly prompt the large language model to generate the required fine-grained passages.\n\n| Method | Page-level NQ | Page-level TriviaQA | Page-level HotpotQA | Passage-level NQ | Passage-level TriviaQA | Passage-level HotpotQA |  \n|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n| LLM2GR | 57.77 | 54.41 | 48.70 | 40.82 | 68.20 | 30.04 |\n| W/o first stage | 32.22 | 24.87 | 23.36 | 36.27 | 63.33 | 24.16 |\n\nWe found that in this case the performance of current large language models would drop dramatically. Current large language models have difficulty recalling key segments from a vast space, so we adopted this trade-off of using the two-stage method.\n\n**W2: Re-ranking methods**\n\nRe-ranking methods need to recalculate cross attentions between the retrieved top-k passages and the question, i.e. access each retrieved passage during inference. Our method, like dense retrieval, does not directly access passages during retrieval, but relies on parameters stored in the model, which is different from re-ranking and is a parallel method to dense retrieval. Therefore, we did not compare with further re-ranking methods, similar to previous generative retrieval methods like SEAL(Bevilacqua et al., 2022).\n\n**W3/W4: Comparison with other generative retrieval baselines and query2doc**\n\nWe conducted experiments with SEAL(Bevilacqua et al., 2022) and reproduced LLM-URL(Ziems et al., 2023) and Query2doc(Wang et al.,2023) using the same hyperparameter settings with Llama2 13b on NQ and WOW datasets.\n\n| Method | Page-level NQ | Page-level WOW | Passage-level NQ | Passage-level WOW | \n|-|-|-|-|-|\n| bm25 | 26.33 | 28.78 | 23.65 | 50.36 |\n| DPR | 54.74 | 26.62 | 47.94 | 45.38 | \n| SEAL | 64.15 | 50.49 | 44.94 | 62.08 |\n| llm-url+bm25 | - | - | 19.67 | 43.09 |\n| query2doc+bm25 | 47.55 | 48.49 | 41.42 | 62.02 |\n| LLM2GR | 57.77 | 57.63 | 40.82 | 63.43 |\n\nWe found that the trained SEAL method has been greatly improved compared to dense retrieval methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of generative retrieval through internal model interactions. Both SEAL and DPR methods have gone through extensive training, while our method can achieve competitive results in zero-shot settings by prompting large language models. \n\nThe llm-url method generates Wikipedia URLs using large language models, but it is difficult to directly map to KILT benchmark documents, so we only provided passage-level experimental results. We found that when using the llama2 13b model, it is difficult to generate enough valid Wikipedia URLs to achieve effective results.\n\nThe query2doc method enhances retrieval by prompting LLM to generate virtual document. We noticed a significant improvement over the bm25 method. However, our method can still achieve better results in page-level retrieval by solely utilizing the capabilities of LLMs, and achieve competitive retrieval results at the passage-level.\n\nIn addition, the llm-url method took about 1700 minutes on the NQ dataset, while query2doc took about 430 minutes, both exceeding the 150 minutes consumed by our llm2gr method.\n\n**W5: Other datasets**\n\nSince our method aims to generate fine-grained snippet information without any pre-segmentation of passages using large language models, while MS MARCO, TREC DL 19 and TREC DL 20 consist of fixed pre-segmented passages without providing original documents and final answers like the KILT dataset, it is difficult to properly evaluate our proposed new retrieval scheme. Therefore, we did not choose these standard IR datasets. The variety of task types and large amount of test data in KILT make it a valid evaluation in our opinion.\n\n**W6: FM-index pre-building**\n\nIn fact, our method uses pre-built FM-index in implementation, which takes about 8h to build the entire Wikipedia corpus. During generation retrieval, we can directly extract the corresponding index sections, so the time consumption is negligible."

                        "value": "**W7: The main difference compared to generating short snippets in SEAL**\n\nThe biggest difference between our method and the SEAL method is that we do not need any pre-segmentation of passages. The start positions of passages are also discovered autonomously by the LLMs. We aim to explore a more flexible new retrieval scheme, which is also more challenging.\n\n**W8: Selecting the first prefix**\n\nSince we select from limited top-k documents, and the short prefixes also have a certain length, this method can produce a unique result in most cases. However, we also noticed that when documents get longer and more top-k documents are obtained, more ambiguity may occur leading to some bias. We think this bias can be solved by combining with re-ranking methods in future work. Since our paper focuses on the retrieval part, we leave this to future work.\n\n**Q1: Single-stage method**\n\nSame as W1.\n\n**Q2: FM-index pre-building**\n\nSame as W6. \n\n**Q3: Other baselines**\n\nSame as W2-W4.\n\n**Q4: The information amount of generated short prefixes**\n\nRegarding the concern that generated short prefixes may lack information amount, we think this information can be obtained from the information stored in the parameters of the large language model. When the language model can accurately recall relevant snippets, a short prefix is enough to locate the target snippet. However, when the recall ability of the language model is not strong enough, we think generating multiple snippet parts or using the multi-stage method like our method can help improve recall.\n\n**Q5: Memory usage of storage**\n\nAs analyzed in Section 4.4 on storage, dense retrieval methods require about 60G memory, sparse retrieval BM25 needs about 17G, while our method only needs 25mb for the title prefix tree, and 8G for the pre-built full Wikipedia FM-index. Our method has more efficient memory utilization compared to previous methods.\n\n**Q6: The impact of short prefix length**\n\nIn Appendix A.5 we experimented the impact of different prefix lengths on performance. We observed that over-short prefixes may not contain enough information, and shorter lengths make it hard to locate a unique passage, leading to performance drop. When generating longer prefixes, there is also a performance drop, slightly counter-intuitive. We analyzed this may be because current large language models are still more suitable for generating and retrieving shorter snippets, and longer prefixs introduce additional noise, causing performance degradation."

To this end, the authors have developed a framework that tries to mimic the search process adopted by humans. Here the key model is the language model. From Figure 1, the model developed comprises of two stages:\n1. In stage 1, the model finds relevant documents given a query\n2. The model then finds a reference passage in the relevant document.\n\nThe authors then expand upon their idea in Figure 2 where they depict the complete model.\n\nThe authors then conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.\n\nJust a minor comment to the authors: the title of the paper is very general. This paper is about passage retrieval. It would have been nice had the authors reflected it in their paper title. Generative information retrieval has now become a broad field and continues to grow."

In terms of effectiveness, the model, from the experimental results demonstrates that it improves upon the existing method. The paper also discusses efficiency issues with large language modelling approaches, especially in retrieval settings where it is important to retrieve the relevant documents as efficiently as possible.\n\nPassage retrieval has been long studied in the information retrieval literature. The goal is to retrieve relevant passages rather than documents so that a user can find their relevant information as quickly as possible. While there are traditional approaches such as the BM25 used in the past, this paper develops a generative learning method that has become popular recently using the transformer architecture.\n\nIn the two-stage method, the model mainly uses the Wikipedia document collection to help retrieve relevant information for the user. The quantitative results demonstrate that the model improves upon existing methods."

                    "value": "The issue with this work is that in the two-stage approach, the model will propagate errors from one stage to the next. While the unified approach would be highly complicated, the authors must realise that this is the shortcoming of this work.\n\nIt must be also noted by the authors that they use only Wikipedia articles that might help improve the efficiency of the model. The medium and large-sized models usually use a large amount of document collections which surely helps encode plenty of information which might not be present in Wikipedia, this does not mean that other models are relatively less efficient than this model. What would have been nice had the authors discussed the pros and cons of using large datasets that go beyond Wikipedia?"

                        "value": "Thank you very much for your careful review! I also appreciate your comments on the title!\n\n**Q1: Error propagation of the two-stage method**\n\nFirstly, regarding the concern about the two-stage method, this is indeed a kind of trade-off when the current large language model (LLM) finds it difficult to directly activate its generation of fine-grained passages. In the ablation experiment in section 4.3 and Table 4 of our paper, we found that:\n\n| Method | Page-level NQ | Page-level TriviaQA | Page-level HotpotQA | Passage-level NQ | Passage-level TriviaQA | Passage-level HotpotQA |\n| ------ | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| LLM2GR | 57.77 | 54.41 | 48.70 | 40.82 | 68.20 | 30.04 |\n| w/o first stage | 32.22 | 24.87 | 23.36 | 36.27 | 63.33 | 24.16 |\n\nWhen the first stage of generating title identifiers to locate the required documents is not present, the performance drops dramatically. The current large language models have difficulty recalling key segments from a vast space in a zero-shot setting, so we have adopted this trade-off.\n\n**Q2: Use of Wikipedia Corpus**\n\nAs for the use of the Wikipedia corpus, this is because the current large language models use data from the general domain most widely, and Wikipedia is the most typical one. This allows the LLM to effectively remember the content from this part of the pre-training phase. However, for more specialized corpora, the LLM has not undergone sufficient training, causing the LLM to not be able to recall this part of the content well, leading to poor performance in vertical domains. We fully agree with the importance of applying LLM to generate fine-grained passages in various vertical domains, but the current method cannot achieve results as superior as those with Wikipedia data, which is a limitation of the current method. Continuous exploration is still needed for more effective incorporation of new domain knowledge documents and research on instruction tuning to activate recall capabilities."
