The high-level idea (as stated in the paper) is that the poisoned parameters would only be deemed important for adversaries \u2013 namely, parameters that are shared by minority will most likely be the poisoned ones."

It also appears to non-explicitly assume some data similarity in non-IID setups.\n\n3. The evaluation is insufficient. With respect to the motivation that mentions LLMs, the evaluation is based on few toy CNNs and datasets.\n\n4.

With a centralized coordinator, privacy can be enhanced using DP and secure aggregation techniques. What privacy guarantees can be expected in DFL?\n\n4. In a non-IID DFL setup, each client may have a different data distribution with different resulting FI. In that case, why consensus filtering is expected to work?\n\n5. In a non-IID DFL setup, multiple local steps may result in bad performance without additional mechanisms to prevent client drift. Has this consideration been taken into account in the non-IID evaluation?"

                        "value": "Thanks for the insightful comments. We appreciate the positive comments on our wirting comments and our evaluation part. We believe the main concern of this reviewer is on the assumption of our threat model as well as our inaccurate claim on LLM in the original submission. We now try to address these issues as follows.\n\n# Assumption on  minority of attackers \n* Our method is indeed building on the assumption that attackers only constitute a minority of the clients. or formally the attacker number cannot be larger than $1/2$ of the entire number of clients.  This setting is inherited from existing data poisoning literature in FL. For example, in Krum (Blanchard el al, 2017), it is written on Page 2 that \"Assuming $2f + 2 < n$, we show that Krum satisfies the resilience property aforementioned...\" where $f$ is the number of malicoius clients and $n$ is the total number of clients.  A similar assumption is also made in Theorem 1 of Trimmed Mean (Yin et al., 2018). We do not relax this assumption as it serves as the foundation of our method design. \n\nBlanchard P, El Mhamdi E M, Guerraoui R, et al. Machine learning with adversaries: Byzantine tolerant gradient descent[J]. Advances in neural information processing systems, 2017, 30.\n\nYin D, Chen Y, Kannan R, et al. Byzantine-robust distributed learning: Towards optimal statistical rates[C]//International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2018: 5650-5659.\n\n* Though we are not able to remove this assumption, it is indeed interesting to investigate how our method performs empirically under the circumstance that there is a small portion of poisoned data scattered over many clients. This use case is interesting to study because it is possible that many clients may accidentally collect the same poisoned samples from a particular location into their own dataset.  \n\nWe have done an experiment to verify if Silencer is robust to this attack. We will get back to you once the results are available. \n\n# Assumption that clients have no knowledge of any data except their own.\n* Our method indeed relies on this assumption. We insist that this assumption is pretty standard for a federated learning setting because the clients cannot have knowledge about other client's data given the privacy constraint.  \n\n* However, we do agree that the attacker can have a completely clean dataset on their own. This dataset can be obtained by making a copy of their own data before poisoning it.  We have designed an adaptive attack based on this case. \n\n* (Experiment on new adaptive attack) Specifically, we consider another adaptive attack named BenignSearch, in which the adversary uses its own non-poisoned dataset for mask searching. Then it uses its poisoned dataset (built upon the original benign dataset) to update the parameters within the active parameters (as specified by the mask). We show how Silencer performs towards this attack under different chosen $\\alpha_0$. \n\n|         Methods (IID)         | Benign Acc |  ASR  |\n|:-----------------------------:|:----------:|:-----:|\n|            DFedAvg            |    91.0    |  66.1 |\n|    Silencer($\\alpha_0=0.1$)   |    91.13   |  1.83 |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0=0.01$)     | 90.52      | 4.92  |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.001$)  | 90.80      | 3.21  |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.0001$) | 91.21      | 65.24 |\n\n\n|       Methods (Non-IID)       | Benign Acc |  ASR  |\n|:-----------------------------:|:----------:|:-----:|\n|            DFedAvg            |    88.8    |  86.4 |\n|   Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.1$)  |    87.70   |  9.67 |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.01$)   | 87.37      | 44.14 |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.001$)  | 87.43      | 37.49 |\n| Silencer($\\alpha_0 = 0.0001$) | 87.49      | 68.99 |\n\nAs found, Silencer can always be robust to this adaptive attack when $\\alpha_0$ is set to be large enough. \n\nThe reason that Silencer is robust to this adaptive attack is that those poisoned parameters will not be recognized as important for those benign clients, and therefore would not be contained in the benign masks. As a result, no matter what the attackers are going to do, their parameters will just not be recognized as useful by most of the benign clients. \n\nWe hope this erases the reviewer's concern assumption on the malicious client's data. \n\n\n# Assumption on data similarity.\nWe do not make any assumptions on the data similarity. In Table 6, we test Silencer's performance under different Non-IID levels, which shows its robustness to different levels of data similarity."

In the Non-IID scenario, no matter how we tune the pruning ratio (which is a critical hyper-parameter), the ASR cannot be lowered than D-FedAvg. This is because Silencer by design is not aiming to counter the situation that every client is a potential attacker. \n\nHowever, we still insist that our proposed defense is valid, because in reality, it is very hard to poison every client (or larger than 50% of clients) in the system.  We will soon update the results and discussion into the revised paper. Thanks for checking!"

For example, the generalization-aware algorithm FedSAM (Qu et al, 2022) also can only converge to a neighborhood of a stationary point, but this does not hinder it from achieving SOTA performance in the testing set.  In our paper, as we care more about robustness/practical performance on testing datasets, we insist that Silencer has its own contribution.\n\n\nQu Z, Li X, Duan R, et al.

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for pointing out the issues of our submission. Below we try to carefully address them, \n\n# Silencer performances are clearly reduced when attackers learn the masks.\n\nAs shown in Table 4, our solution indeed fails to defend against Curiosity attack. However, we insist that Silencer is still robust to adaptive attacks given the following arguments. \n* It is important to note that in Curiosity attack, we assume the attackers have full knowledge of the consensus subspace, which typically cannot be obtained easily without global consensus knowledge, i.e., knowledge of others' masks in the training process. \n* Aiming to lower the probability that the attackers can infer the benign clients' masks,  we adopt a security-enhanced version of Silencer, i.e.,  Silencer-SE to mitigate the risk of mask leakage based on the idea of noise addition. We also did experiments to evaluate the performance of Silencer-SE in Table 5. \n\n# Using Fisher information as a signal for different objectives is not novel.\n* While this is not the first time using Fisher information as an indicator of the importance of the parameters, we insist that this is the first time that Fisher information is used to identify poisoned parameters in backdoor defense literature. And this is our the first empirical finding of the invariant Fisher information pattern over the backdoor attack scenario.     \n\n* Moreover, the Fisher-information-based pruning-aware training should also be counted as a novel contribution. This method has not appeared in anywhere to the best knowledge of the authors. \n\n# Too many tables and figures in the main text. \n\nWe apologize for the unnecessarily compact layout of the paper. We will fix this issue in our final version of the paper. Perhaps putting some experimental results in the Appendix would fix this issue. \n\n# Adaptation to accelerated gossip or asynchronous gossip.\n* Our experiment is indeed run in the accelerated gossip setting (Chen et al, 2021). in which each client would run multiple steps before sending the update for aggregation.  \n*  We believe that our method can also be extended to asynchronous gossip scenarios. However, we mainly consider synchronous gossip scenarios because the asynchronous one would add complexity to our method and may potentially obscure the primary contributions. \n\nChen Y, Yuan K, Zhang Y, et al. Accelerating gossip SGD with periodic global averaging[C]//International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2021: 1791-1802.\n\n# Explanation of the curves of the figure 1.\nIn Figure 1 we report a case study by poisoning the DFL network with 10% of attackers.  The x-axis is the attack success ratio, and the y-axis demonstrates the kernel density of models within the particular range of ASR.  For example, when x=0.8, the kernel density is approximately 3.7, which is a relatively high value. This means that a large portion of the models among all the clients models having ASR 80%.  The conclusion of this figure is that DFL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks when there are a few attackers in the system. We want to demonstrate this conclusion because this is the first study of backdoor attack in DFL, despite a concurrent work  (Yar et al., 2023). \n\n# Extra computation needed by silencer and the saved computation.\n\n* The extra computation mainly comes from the maks searching process. It typically involves extracting the gradient over the local dataset and the TOPK operation of the gradient.   Among these two,  the main computation overhead comes from the gradient extraction, because we do one full pass of the client's local dataset in this stage. However, we may also use a batch of the samples to calculate the approximated gradient in order to save computation. \n\n* For sparsity in training, it currently cannot offer a practical speedup effect in our testbed. This is because we are using an unstructured sparsification technique, which cannot guarantee speed up in the current stage. However, our method is extensible to structured sparsify, which can indeed offer a practical speedup. We would like to refer to Q3.5 of a funny SNN handbook by Liu et al,2023 for addressing the concern over the practical acceleration of unstructured sparsity. \n\nLiu S, Wang Z.

For Reclamation, we recover the same amount of parameters that are important for the clients into the mask. The number of parameters being pruned and recovered is determined by a decaying scalar $\\alpha_t$.  \n\n* The motivation of the design is based on observation in Fig. (3b), which demonstrates that the FI of a benign clients is unstable and is changing between rounds. This motivates us to design an alternative pruning/recovering process to stabilize (but also be able to update) the mask, and thereby stabilize the model training process.\n\n# Warm reminder\n\nAs the reviewer is mainly concerned with the presentation and some technical details of our paper, can our rebuttal clarify the reviewer's concern?  We would like to write a warm reminder that the top 25% score of ICLR submission this time is as high as 6.2.

As a lot of comments have been added, I will try to understand a bit more the answers before eventually raising my score. Here my first impressions:\n- on BenignSearch: if I understand correctly, BenignSearch only takes into account that the attackers have the knowledge of their own data. That's great that it is does not break the algorithm, because assuming otherwise seems unrealistic. Am I mistaken? Silencer CE is more interesting, but comes to a high communication cost, so I need to think about it.\n- on Fisher information novelty: I note that several reviewers find this point interesting and asked questions, so it seems indeed to raise interest.\n- on the presentation: yes please do, in particular if you incorporate some clarification in the text, replacing figure by text would be great. I would nominate Figure 2 to disappear, Figure 5 to be put in appendix (maybe with addition of other topology), Table 2, 3, 6 could also move with little harm to appendix I believe.\n- on enhanced gossip. I had a look to your new appendix A.3, that is a related work section on communication/variance reduction in gossip algorithms and the desire to let adaptions to future work. After such a big rebuttal, no one can deny that you cannot do everything. However, I would be more interested in a real discussion of the difficulty of adapting your approach that this very generic paragraph.\n- on the computation/communication cost: not only I get the general bashing on 'you don't put the right score' but I also get an article designed to \"summarize some most common confusions in SNNs, that one may come across in various scenarios such as paper review/rebuttal and talks - many drawn from the authors\u2019 own bittersweet experiences\". I guess I could apologize to be your stupid reviewer, but unfortunately reading the third \"Common Confusion in SNNs\" didn't answer to my very naive question: Is silencer costly in practice? Compare to other attacks, is the cost reasonable ? Even if your research implementation a bit costly, do you it could be reduced by leveraging over some structured sparsity ? I believe your answer is yes, but it is not clear to me.\n- on stability: I note the experiments you did on the convergence for N48q.\n\nI will go again through the paper in the next days, and I thank you for your detailed answers"

                        "value": "# More information on BenignSearch.\nYou got this.  The attackers only have the knowledge of their own data. The procedure is that the attacker maintains two copies of the local data: the first copy is their original clean dataset; the second copy is the poisoned dataset, which is obtained by modifying its clean dataset (i.e., adding backdoor trigger and modifying label for some portion of randomly chosen data). The attacker would use the clean copy for mask searching and use the poisoned copy to poison its active model parameters. \n\n# More information on Silencer-SE\nSilencer-SE is designed to enhance Silencer's robustness towards Curiosity attack. The intuition comes from the fact that Silencer cannot defend against Curiosity because of the leakage of the Consensus mask. In Silencer-SE, we add noise to lower this leakage risk. \n\n**But we need to clarify here that  Silencer-SE does not incur extra communication compared to Silencer.** In Silencer, we ask the clients to send the full dimension of model parameters to its peers, which has the same communication cost as the classical gossiping solution, e.g., D-FedAvg. This is the same for Silencer-SE, but the difference is that the model parameters are encoded before communication by adding some noise. For SIlencer-CR, we reduce communication by asking the clients to only send a subset of the parameters. However, it is not robust against adaptive attacks, as the consensus masks can be easily inferred by the attackers.    \n\n# On presentation.\nThanks for giving the concrete instructions on saving some space. We will follow that and will update the paper when rebuttal ends (modifying layout may change the order of table and figure, which may cause inconsistency and confusion over discussion, therefore we may want to postpone the update).\n\n# On adaptation to existing solution.\nWe will talk about some difficulties in adapting our solution to SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al, 2020), FedDyn(Acar et al, 2021), etc. We envision some difficulties for these client drift correction algorithms. For example, it is challenging to deal with the centralized control variates in SCAFFOLD. Silencer enforces each client to only train on a subset of the parameters. This would incur difficulty in defining and computing control variate for drift correction. We have updated our discussion in Appendix A.3 to give specific example of the challenges.\n\nKarimireddy S P, Kale S, Mohri M, et al. Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning[C]//International conference on machine learning. PMLR, 2020: 5132-5143.\n\nAcar D A E, Zhao Y, Navarro R M, et al. Federated learning based on dynamic regularization[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.04263, 2021.\n\n# On computation/communication cost.\nSilencer indeed incurs some extra computation cost, but it does not incur more communication cost. The extra computation cost comes from the mask searching process, in which we need to i) calculate the Fisher information. ii) Sort out the TOPK Fisher information. We also need to do multiple steps just like D-FedAvg (but the complexity is the same with it).  We show the clock time of these three basic procedures.\n\n| Methods (IID) | FI calculation | TOPK pruning/reclamation | Local training |\n|:-------------:|----------------|:------------------------:|----------------|\n|    DFedAvg    | 0      s        |             0     s       | 1.544    s      |\n|    Silencer   | 0.755     s     |           0.020    s      | 1.513   s       |\n\nFor the FI calculation, we can save some time by using only a (or a few) batches for calculation. For the local training stage, we can potentially be faster if using structured sparsity or some more advanced unstructured sparsity technique (e.g., 2:4 sparsification). For structured sparsity, a straightforward adaptation is to ask each client to prune/recover the parameters in the granularity of the channel. For measuring the importance of each channel, we can sum the Fisher information of each coordinates within a channel. In this way, the local training cost can be reduced.\n\n#  On convergence experiment for Reviewer N48q.\nOur conclusion is that the iterates can only reach a neighborhood of the stationary point from the standpoint of convex/non-convex optimization. Just let us know if you have further comments on it. Thanks!\n\n# Straight comments from authors.\nWe generally believe that not an algorithm is perfect in every aspect. We don't want to hide the weakness of our algorithm (e.g., extra computation, may fail against some adaptive attacks in some cases, cannot converge to a stationary point, cannot accelerate due to unstructured sparsity,  etc).   To clarify this, we will write a paragraph in the discussion board to highlight the weakness of our algorithms. Thank you and all the other reviewers for asking these questions, helping us thoroughly re-evaluate our algorithms."

There is a gap between the observation of the stability of the Fisher information and using the magnitude of the Fisher information as the indicator for pruning. \nSuppose the magnitude of the fisher information of benign models could be larger than the malicious models. In that case, I will consider this work an extension of the pruning based on the sharpness, one of the significant investigated indicators of the hessian in the generalization field. Previously, people believed that the low sharpness directly leads to better generalization. However, this is not true based on the recent paper, and I think it will comprise the contribution of the proposed method.\n\"A Modern Look at the Relationship between Sharpness and Generalization, ICML 2023\"\n3.

We try to address the review one-by-one as follows.\n\n# Error of statistical comparison in Figure 3(a).\nIndeed, some unignorable errors between empirical FI and Hessian are observed in Figure 3(a). This is inevitable as we are using first-order information to approximate second-order information. However, our method should be robust to this error because in our mask searching process, we are using the order of the FI, but not the exact value for pruning/reclamation.\n\n \n# On the approximation of Hessian and diagonal of FI along training \n\n* We can only conclude that the approximation will be exact if the model conditional output is equal to the data label's conditional distribution, or formally when $P$ and $Q_w$ are equal (where $P( y|x)$ is the data distribution, and $Q_w( y| x)$ is the output distribution of a model). \n\n* Indeed, the Hessian of the model will not be zero after convergence, but the fact is that empirical Fisher information would also not be zero when the model converges. Recall that the definition of empirical FI is $F_i( w) = \\frac{1}{N_i} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_i} \\left (\\nabla_{ w}  \\log Q_{w}( y_n \\mid  x_n) \\right )^2 $, and its alternative form can be written as $F_i( w) = \\frac{1}{N_i} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_i} \\left (\\nabla_{ w}  f_i (w ; x,y )\\right)^2 $, where $\\nabla_{ w}  f_i (w ; x,y )$ is the gradient of cross entropy loss. Note that this term is not zero in convergence given that we only have $ \\frac{1}{N_i} \\sum_{n=1}^{N_i} \\nabla_{ w}  f_i (w ; x,y ) =0 $ when converges. \n\n\n* Unfortunately, we did not figure out a theoretical tool to bound the error between approximation along the training process, and this is our motivation to visualize the FI pattern in Figure 3.\n\n# Connection between FI stability and using the magnitude for pruning.  \nGiven that the coordinates with larger diagonal FI means that these coordinates are more important. Therefore the magnitude of FI can actually reflect the poisoned parameters. We can actually combine the invariant property in Figure 3 to show that i) the poisoned parameters are unique and are shared by malicious clients. ii) the poisoned patterns are not changing accross rounds.\n These observation indicate that: \n1. we can safely prune those poisoned parameters based on the model's FI over one particular malicious client's data to recover the model backdoor performance.  This is corroborated by the good performance of FMP-A in Figure 3.(c). \n\n2. It is enough to take the empirical FI over the last round model to find out poisoned parameters.  Note that empricial FI is not strictly equal to Hessian in last round, so it may not accurately reflects poisoned parameters if we don't have the observation it does not change much across round.  \n\n# The relation between the proposed method and sharpness minimization?\nWe would say that the relation between the proposed method and the sharpness-aware minimization is not that strong. While both methods rely on Hessian somehow, the objectives of them are totally different. Our method aims at utilizing fisher information to recover the poisoned parameters and prune them afterward, in order to improve training robustness.  On the contrary, sharpness-aware minimization is concerned with finding a flat local minima to improve generalization. The optimization methods we propose are also significantly different from sharpness-aware minimization in that we are not taking double backward operation in the local training process.  But we do appreciate the reviewer for pointing out SAM, which potentially can be combined with our method to further improve its generalization ability.  \n\n\n# How to see the pruning rate in Figure 3c.\nThanks for the reminder. We did not plot the pruning ratio in the figure, which easily leads to confusion. Now we use the size of the marker as an indicator of pruning ratio. \n\n# Line 12 of algorithm 1 is different from Equation 8. The mask should also be included in line 12.\n* Thanks for the reminder. Line 12  is different from Equation 8 because in line 10 we use an intermediate variable $w_{i,t+\\frac{1}{2}}$ to capture the mask update in Equation 8. We write in this way because we would like to express how the clients are going to communicate with others in Line 11. \n\n* But we do see that there is a small typo in Line 12 because of an inconsistent definition of neighbors set. Thanks for drawing our attention to this line in the algorithm.  \n\n# Warm reminder\nWe hope our answer erases the concerns of the reviewers. And we would like to mention that the top 25% score of ICLR submission this time is as high as 6.2. As you mention that finding in Fisher information pruning is interesting, and it seems that you generally hold a supportive view as can be seen from your comment, would you consider raising the score based on our rebuttal? We would also appreciate further comments on related items like Fisher information, sharpness-awareness minimization, etc.  Thanks!"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments on our paper. We address them as follows.\n\n# Why the round/client invariance pattern happens?\n\n* Our conjecture is that the backdoor trigger is a fixed and easy-to-detect pattern that can be easily classified with a few parameters within the network. This is very different from other benign patterns, which requires developing different channels (or parameters) to classify. That explains why the poisoning pattern is invariant along rounds while the benign pattern is not.\n\n*  (Why client invariance?) This is because the malicious clients share the same objective of classifying the backdoor trigger, they may develop the same poisoned parameters. However, the benign clients would exploit diversified benign patterns, and thereby the benign clients develop different patterns, but the malicious clients share the same pattern. \n\n# Does this hold for particular types of backdoors or more general cases?\n* We show that this pattern is significant for dirty label blackdoor (Gu et al., 2017) in which the attacker may add a trigger in training time and simultaneously modify the data label. \n\n* Clean-label attack is a blackdoor attack in the particular case that the attacker is not allowed to modify the label of the data.\nAnd it is shown by (Turner et al,2018) and (Zeng et al, 2022) that the effectiveness of this particular attack is significantly lower than the dirty-label attack, unless taking specific extra operations to recover the comparable performance, e.g., adding adversarial noise or GANs to perturb the feature of the original samples in  (Turner et al,2018) et al, or taking extra optimization on the trigger (Zeng et al, 2022). Because adversaries should have full control of their local data in FL setting, there is few motivations for them to perform clean-label blackdoor attack, which typically have lower performance than dirty-label attack. Therefore, we believe clean label attack in this field is less of interest.  However, our conjecture is that the invariant pattern also hold for clean-label attack, as the pattern actually encodes the association between the trigger and the target label. \n\nGu T, Dolan-Gavitt B, Garg S.

Narcissus: A practical clean-label backdoor attack with limited information[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.05255, 2022.\n\n# The threat model does not consider the case that the adversary can manipulate the masking process. \n\nThanks for pointing out this issue in our writing of the threat model.  We actually allow the clients to manipulate the masking process and we constantly try to develop new adaptive attacks to break through our defense. As shown in our original submission, we designed two adaptive attacks:\n* i) Fix mask attack. We allow adversaries to keep their masks unchanged during the mask-searching process. We show that Silencer design can be robust to this attack.\n* ii) Curiosity attack. We assume the adversaries know the consensus mask and project their update into it. We show that Silencer is not robust to this adaptive attack. However, it is generally hard for the attackers to exactly know the consensus mask, and we do add a security-enhanced version of Silencer with Gaussian noise to mitigate the leakage of the consensus mask. \n* iii) Inspired by another reviewer, we design another adaptive attack named BenignSearch that assumes that the attacker uses a benign dataset for mask searching, but uses poisoned samples for training. We are running this experiment and release the results once it finishes.\n\n We would also like to collect the reviewer's ideas on new adaptive attacks to break through our defense. We will test them with experiments and will release the code ASAP.\n\n# Silencer is outperformed by other defenses.\nIn fact, no defense can outperform Silencer in both benign accuracy and ASR. For example, in Table 1 ASR of  D-Bulyan is lower than Silencer (3.72% vs. 10.96%), but it is at the cost of reduction of benign accuracy (80.34 vs. 87.31). This is also the case in Table 8. The ASR and benign accuracy of D-Krum and Silencer in FashionMnist is (0.25 vs 5.61) and (80.13 vs. 88.44). \n\n# Warm reminder\nWe hope our answer erases the concerns of the reviewers. And we would like to mention that the top 25% score of ICLR submission this time is 6.2.  As you agree that the poisoning pattern that motivates the defense is interesting, the experiments are comprehensive, and the paper is well-written,  would you consider raising the score based on our rebuttal? We also looks forward to futher feedback on our paper. Appreciate it!"

We would like to confirm if our responses erase your concern. \n\n* **(Invariant pattern)** It seems that you are generally interested in our finding of round/client invariant pattern, and would like to understand what leads to this phenomenon. Does our explanation in the rebuttal make sense to you?  \n\n* **(Type of backdoor attack)** For the type of backdoor attack being assumed,  we inherit the attack setting from the dirty-label backdoor literature, which is adopted in most (if not all) federated learning backdoor attack/defense, e.g., (Sun et al,2019), (Wang et al, 2020), (Ozdayi et al, 2021), etc. Defense against dirty label backdoor attacks is still an emerging area, and therefore we don't want to distract the attention of readers by defining another type of not common attack.  We hope the reviewer can understand. \n\nSun Z, Kairouz P, Suresh A T, et al. Can you really backdoor federated learning?[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.07963, 2019.\n\nWang H, Sreenivasan K, Rajput S, et al. Attack of the tails: Yes, you really can backdoor federated learning[J]. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020, 33: 16070-16084.\n\nOzdayi M S, Kantarcioglu M, Gel Y R. Defending against backdoors in federated learning with robust learning rate[C]//Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 2021, 35(10): 9268-9276.\n\n* **(Adaptive attack)** To erase the reviewer's concern about adaptive attack, which assumes the attacker knows the defense mechanism and is able to modify its training/mask searching procedure to break it, we have implemented another adaptive attack  named BenignSearch. Our experimental results show Silencer is robust to this adaptive attack.  We hope this somehow erases the reviewer's concern on this issue. \n\n* **(Practical performance)**  For your concern on the practical performance, we note that other defenses can only reduce ASR to a small number *at the cost of a significant drop of benign accuracy*, which is generally not acceptable. \n\n**(Warm reminder)** Given that the rebuttal deadline is approaching,   would you mind checking if our answer solves your concern? Would you mind adjusting the score based on our rebuttal, as it is important to us?  We are also more than happy to discuss with you if you have other questions regarding our finding of invariant pattern, method design, or suggestions on new adaptive attacks, etc.  Thank you!"

                        "value": "We feel that our previous answer on the Fisher pattern on dirty-label and clean-label backdoors is lacking, as we do not provide empirical evidence/in-depth research into different types of attacks. We apologize for our oversight. \n\nTo better study clean-label attacks, our first step is to implement a clean-label attack in our testbed and compare between them. We use the following table to compare the ASR and benign accuracy between clean-label and dirty-label attack\n\n|   Methods (Non-IID)   | Benign Acc |  ASR  |\n|:---------------------:|------------|:-----:|\n| DFedAvg (clean label) | 89.65      | 39.66 |\n|  DFedAvg (dirty label) | 88.70      | 92.56 |\n| Silencer (clean label) | 86.71      | 3.75  |\n| Silencer (dirty label) | 87.52      | 10.99 |\n\nThis result justifies that clean-label attack is less effective in federated learning, which coincides with the finding in previous literature e.g., (Turner et al,2018).\n\nTo show what the Fisher pattern looks like for a clean-label backdoor attack,  we plot the results in Figure 8 in Appendix A.5 of the revised paper. Our observation is that the two invariant pattern does not hold for a clean-label backdoor attack. Our conjecture for the reason is that the poisoned parameters have not been developed well, which results in a variant FI pattern. In other words, when the data has been learned well by the model, their fisher information should be stable across rounds. When the data is similar, the stable Fisher pattern of them should be similar. This explains the invariant pattern of FI for the dirty-label backdoor attack.\n\nWe would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out clean-label backdoor attack for comparison of the FI pattern, which deeper our understanding of the discovered invariant pattern."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for showing concern about the generality of the invariance pattern to us. We are able to make two conclusions based on our experiment results, which were just obtained in our last minutes before the deadline.\n\n* The invariant pattern also works for the case of FL with a central server. We simulate the classical FL scenario with a server being responsible for aggregation and show that this invariance pattern also works in this case. Please refer to Figure 7.(b) in our Appendix A.5 for our results. \n\n* The invariant pattern holds for an invisible backdoor. We implement the WaNet attack, which is an invisible backdoor blending the trigger into the semantics of the input data. Our results in Figure 7.(c) in our Appendix A.5  show that the invariant pattern of WaNet is significant in that the pattern of the malicious clients exhibits i) a strong correlation between clients within the same round, and ii) a strong correlation between different training rounds.  Therefore,  our conclusion is that  *WaNet is not able to break the invariant pattern, though it is shown in their paper that WaNet can escape human inspection, reverse-engineer-based technique (Wang et al., 2019), neuron response screening (Liuet al., 2018), and perturbation-based screening (Gao et al., 2019). \n\n**(why does invariant pattern hold?)** Our belief is that no matter what kinds of attack trigger they use, the malicious clients share the same malicious objective, and therefore their poisoning pattern should be similar. This explains why the client-level invariance should be held when the backdoor function is well-established. For round-invariance, our belief is that no matter what kind of attack is being used, the backdoor trigger is a fixed pattern that should be easily classified with a fixed group of parameters. Therefore when developing the backdoor function, the poisoned parameters are fixed in an early round of training and would not change afterward.     \n\n **(Note from authors)** As we have very limited time in preparing our latest rebuttal, we are not able to fulfill a few things that we initially planned to do, as follows: \n\n i) We are not able to implement the invisible backdoor [1] because it requires us to train an encoder for trigger generation, which requires some time for training and testing. We therefore employ a similar invisible backdoor WaNet (Nguyen et al, 2020) for addressing the reviewer's concern.  \n\nNguyen T A, Tran A T. WaNet-Imperceptible Warping-based Backdoor Attack[C]//International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020.\n\n  ii) We plan to experiment with WaNet to see if Silencer is able to defend against it, but again we are not able to get the results due to time limitations. \n\nTo compensate for this,  we want to make the following promises: \n\n**i) We will prepare all these results in the camera-ready of the paper.**\n\n**ii) The code and the checkpoints will be updated and released in our repo within a few days for public review.**\n\nAll in all, we appreciate your response, which provides concrete directions for us to work on. Thank you!"
