                    "value": "* The reason for the effectiveness of noise alignment and filtering lacks clarity. It remains uncertain why attackers struggle to align their data with noise. It is advisable for the authors to conduct a toy experiment to illustrate this point. For instance, in a scenario involving two clients, we could fix the benign data of both clients to be the same while introducing additional poisoned samples to the first client. Performing one epoch of noise alignment with these two clients and comparing their accuracy on noise samples would shed light on this issue. \n\n\n* The provided rationale for Nira's ability to defend against adaptive attacks is not clear too. The authors shows that Nira is robust to hte adaptive attack where attackers split their poisoned dataset into poisoned and benign segments, aligning only the surrogate samples with the data within the benign segments. The reasons given are that 1) \"scale-up operation on the model weights has its impact\" and 2) poisoned samples in the cross-entropy loss lead to poor alignment. It is suggested that the authors i) disable the scale-up operation, and ii) in the absence of the scale-up operation, substantiate the second reason with experimental results. This is important because it might not be reasonable to assume that attackers cannot produce an over-parameterized model that can simultaneously minimize the alignment loss and the backdoor cross-entropy loss, as these objectives are not inherently contradictory."

                    "value": "The statement that \"calculating these metrics involves malicious models, leading to biased metrics and defense failure\" suggests that involving malicious models in metric calculation introduces bias and can result in defense failure. However, this statement needs further clarification, and it might be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the specific reasons why using malicious models for metric calculation could lead to biased results and ultimately undermine the defense. Additionally, it's worth addressing why Nira's use of malicious models in a similar context does not result in failure.\n\nIn Table 2, the impact of poisoning ratio on benign accuracy appears significant, which is not a usual case for backdoor attack. To better understand this phenomenon, it would be helpful to see the results for scenarios with only one attacker (attacker number = 1) and no attackers (attacker number = 0) under different poisoning ratios for both FedAvg and Nira. This would provide a clearer picture of the algorithm's performance under varying conditions.\n\nIt is suggested to provide experimental results when full client participation is employed, without client selection. The randomness associated with client selection could indeed influence training results, particularly affecting the ASR. Demonstrating how the approach performs under full participation conditions would offer insights into its stability.\n\nClarification on the scale factor in replacement attacks is necessary. It would also be valuable to determine whether Nira remains effective when the scaling-up operation is disabled. Note that the scaling-up operation may not be essential for conducting backdoor attacks.\n\nI would consider adjusting my score based on the authors rebuttal, and will actively participate in it."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review. We appreciate that you find that our method is novel, only requires noise, and improves benign accuracy by aligning with noise. In light of your insightful comments, we offer comprehensive responses below. We also add them into our main text or appendix in the revision. We hope that these responses and the revision have effectively resolved your concerns and enhanced the overall excellence of our work.\n\n> **Q1:** The reason for the effectiveness of noise alignment and filtering lacks clarity. It remains uncertain why attackers struggle to align their data with noise. It is advisable for the authors to conduct a toy experiment to illustrate this point.\n\n***Ans for Q1):*** Thanks for your valuable comments.\n\n- We exploited t-SNE to visualize the feature distribution of the server and clients in Figures 4, 13, 14, and 15. It can be observed that the attacker\u2019s feature distribution is more scattered and loose compared to the benign client, making it perform worse on the surrogate noise data.\n- In response to your constructive comments, we have conducted toy experiments involving two clients. The benign data of both clients is the same while introducing additional poisoned samples to the first client. The accuracy of these two clients on noise samples is shown in Figure 8 Appendix E.11. We can see that the client introducing poisoned samples performs worse on noise samples, making it easier for the server to identify attackers.\n\nWe have added the above results and discussion to our revision.\n\n\n> **Q2:** The provided rationale for Nira's ability to defend against adaptive attacks is not clear too. It is suggested that the authors i) disable the scale-up operation, and ii) in the absence of the scale-up operation, substantiate the second reason with experimental results.\n\n***Ans for Q2):*** Thanks for your constructive comments.\n\n- We apologize for the lack of detailed analysis and experimental support for Nira's defense against adaptive attacks. According to your valuable comments, we analyze the correlation between poisoned data, benign data, and surrogate data below. When attackers train local models, they align the conditional feature distributions between benign data and surrogate data to circumvent the server's detection. In this context, aligning the conditional feature distributions of poisoned data and surrogate data would also align the distributions of poisoned data and benign data, thereby reducing the damage of poisoned samples. If poisoned data and surrogate data are not aligned, the model's accuracy on surrogate samples will be low, making it easy for the server to detect. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively defend against malicious attacks whether poisoned data is aligned with surrogate data or not.\n- To further validate the impact of scale-up on the performance of Nira, we conduct experiments without the scale-up operation, and the alignment loss between poisoned data and surrogate data is shown in Figure 9 Appendix E.11. We can see that the scale-up operation increases the alignment loss between poisoned data and surrogate data.\n\nWe have added the above results and discussion to our revision.\n\n> **Q3:** It might be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the specific reasons why using malicious models for metric calculation could lead to biased results and ultimately undermine the defense. Additionally, it's worth addressing why Nira's use of malicious models in a similar context does not result in failure.\n\n***Ans for Q3):*** We appreciate your suggestion. We have added detailed explanations in the revised paper.\n\n- In previous methods, malicious models are also involved in the calculation of these metrics, thus may yield tainted metrics and fail to achieve effective defense. For example, Krum [1] calculates the sum of the squared distances between each client model and the other client models as its score, and aggregates several models with the lowest scores. However, when the majority are attackers, the score of the malicious model may be relatively lower, leading the server to aggregate malicious models and resulting in defense failure.\n- The proposed method aims to defend against backdoor attacks by designing a metric that will not be tainted by malicious models. To this end, we propose a metric that performs individual evaluation for each local model using surrogate data. This individual evaluation approach renders the metric impervious to variations in the attacker's ratio.\n- The proposed metric (accuracy on surrogate data) can successfully filter out most malicious models, which is consistent with our experimental results reported in Table 5 Appendix E.4."

We can see that the poison ratio has a limited impact on the \"Main Acc\".\n- In response to your constructive comments, we have conducted experiments with only one attacker (attacker number = 1) and no attackers (attacker number = 0) under different poison ratios for both FedAvg and Nira.

We have added the following clarification and experiments to our revision.\n\n- The scale factor we used is $\\frac{m}{n_a}$, where $m$ is the number of clients participating in aggregation each round and $n_a$ is the number of attackers, which is consistent with previous outstanding works [2,3].\n- In response to your constructive comments, we have conducted experiments without the scale-up operation. The results are reported in Table 3-4 as below. We can see that the proposed method still outperforms baselines in the absence of the scale-up operation.\n\n**Table 3-4**\n|Defense||Atk Num = 0|||Atk Num = 10|||Atk Num = 20|||Atk Num = 30||\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n||Acc|Atk Rate|Main Acc|Acc|Atk Rate|Main Acc|Acc|Atk Rate|Main Acc|Acc|Atk Rate|Main Acc|\n|FedAvg|89.35|**0.67**|89.5|81.99|90.94|**89.37**|82.02|91.68|**89.46**|81.7|95.72|**89.49**|\n|RFA|87.51|1.16|87.56|80.19|89.18|87.24|80.1|90.78|87.25|79.48|93.59|86.88|\n|MultiKrum|88.33|1.22|88.4|81.05|90.28|88.27|81.05|91.42|88.38|81.05|93.09|88.53|\n|Coomed|87.91|0.96|87.91|80.57|88.72|87.64|80.4|90.98|87.65|79.85|92.25|87.17|\n|Normclip|79.71|1|79.65|72.05|82.47|77.81|71.61|87.1|77.7|71.57|89.67|77.82|\n|Nira(ours)|**89.74**|0.94|**89.78**|**83.65**|**38.8**|87.13|**84.21**|**39.2**|87.42|**84.06**|**43.8**|87.78|\n\n\n> ***Reference***\n>  \n> [1] Blanchard, Peva, et al. \"Machine learning with adversaries: Byzantine tolerant gradient descent.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017).\n> \n> [2] Bagdasaryan, Eugene, et al. \"How to backdoor federated learning.\" International conference on artificial intelligence and statistics.

We appreciate that you find that our method is technically novel and sound, our paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the experimental evaluations are comprehensive. According to your valuable comments, we provide detailed feedback below and also add them into our main text or appendix in the revision. We hope that these responses have addressed your concerns and improved our work.\n\n> **Q1:** The proposed approach is based on strong assumptions that the malicious attackers follow the proposed protocol, i.e. training both surrogate and local datasets with the proposed objectives exactly or adaptively.\n\n***Ans for Q1):*** Thanks for your insightful comments. We agree with the point that malicious attackers may reject to follow the proposed protocol. In this context, the model sent from malicious attackers will produce a poor performance on the constructed surrogate data. Accordingly, our method will detect these models as malicious models. Therefore, malicious attackers who reject to follow the proposed protocol fail to mount a backdoor attack.\n\nWe have highlighted this in-depth discussion in our revision. Thanks again for your constructive comments.\n\n\n> **Q2:** The introduction of surrogate data may easily prompt malicious attackers to inject backdoor triggers and objectives into the surrogate dataset as well. Have the authors considered these scenarios?\n\n***Ans for Q2):*** We apologize for the missing discussion. Following your valuable question, we have added the following experiments and discussion in our revision.\n\nMalicious attacks may inject backdoor triggers into the surrogate data. However, if an attacker attempts to mount a backdoor attack on the surrogate data, the model sent from the attacker will achieve poor performance on the surrogate data shared among clients and server. As a result, the server will filter out these malicious models by evaluating their performance on the surrogate data. Therefore, injecting backdoor triggers on the surrogate data will also be detected by the proposed method. To verify the point, we inject backdoor triggers into the surrogate dataset on a malicious client while other settings are the same as our original setting. The results are reported in Table 1-1 as below. The results show that these malicious clients will not bypass the proposed method.\n\n**Table 1-1**\n|Defense|Metric||||Surrogate Data Poison Ratio||||\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|||0%|5%|10%|20%|40%|60%|80%|\n||Acc|87.67|87.59|**88**|87.78|87.41|87.54|87.02|\n|Nira|Atk Rate|**2.23**|2.23|2.41|2.65|3.09|2.47|3.15|\n||Main Acc|87.88|87.83|**88.22**|88.05|87.79|87.82|87.22|\n\n> **Q3:** The metric that the server used for filtering out malicious attackers appears to use a distance outliner (eq.6) and thresholds, which may be also tainted if the majority are attackers.\n\n***Ans for Q3):*** Thanks for pointing out the potentially confusing description. We have added detailed explanations in the revised paper.\n\n- The proposed method aims to defend against backdoor attacks by designing a metric that will not be tainted by malicious models. To this end, we propose a metric that performs individual evaluation for each local model using surrogate data. This individual evaluation approach renders the metric impervious to variations in the attacker's ratio.\n- The proposed metric (accuracy on surrogate data) can successfully filter out most malicious models, which is consistent with our experimental results reported in Table 5 Appendix E.4.\n- However, it is challenging for a single metric to detect all malicious models, even if the metric is not tainted by malicious models. Thus, we introduce a supplementary metric to further promote the performance. The supplementary metric is inspired by existing methods, employing the distance among local models. Thus, the supplementary metric has the risk of being tainted.\n- By integrating these two metrics, the proposed method achieves a more potent defense performance, particularly in scenarios with a significant proportion of attackers."

Thanks again for your constructive comments.\n\n> **Q5:** Why do the filtering thresholds vary with time in experiments? Are there any insights on how to adjust them systematically?\n\n***Ans for Q5):*** Thanks for pointing out this potentially confusing problem.\n\n- In the federated learning scenario, the accuracy of client models on local data improves with increasing training rounds. Since the proposed method aligns the feature distributions of local data and surrogate data, the performance of client models on surrogate data also improves. Therefore, the accuracy threshold $\\sigma_1$ increases and the distance threshold $\\sigma_2$ decreases as the training rounds progress.\n- We introduced an efficient method in Appendix E.5 for selecting thresholds: First, train a few rounds on a small number of identified benign clients, referring to the accuracy of the model on surrogate data and the similarity of features during the training process to assist in selecting $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$. Then the selected $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are used for the training of all clients. \n\nFollowing your valuable comments, we have added the above discussion to our revision.\n\n> **Q6:** What does \"features of the model\" mean and how to determine the value of b?\n\n***Ans for Q6):*** We apologize for the confusing description. \n\n- The \"features of the model\" refer to the output features of a specific layer in a neural network.\n\nFollowing your valuable comments, we have fixed it in our revision.\n\n- b stands for the number of noise samples used for evaluating local models. Considering that using all surrogate data will cause significant computation overhead, we set it to a fixed value of 128 for all experiments. \n- Following your valuable question, we conduct ablations on the sensitivity of b and report results in Table 1-4 as below. We can see that b has a limited impact on the performance.\n\n**Table 1-4**\n|Defense|Metric|||Noise Sample Num b|||\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|||64|128|256|512|1024|\n||Acc|87.31|87.67|**87.7**|87.54|87.24|\n|Nira|Atk Rate|1.92|2.23|2.89|**1.9**|2.69|\n||Main Acc|87.42|**87.88**|87.83|87.69|87.49|\n\nWe have added the above results and discussion to our revision."

Here is a **summary of our response** for your convenience:\n- (1) **The proposed approach is based on strong assumptions**: We have explained that malicious attackers who reject to follow the proposed protocol fail to mount a backdoor attack.\n- (2) **Inject backdoor triggers and objectives into the surrogate dataset**: Following your constructive comments, we have conducted experiments where we inject backdoor triggers into the surrogate dataset on a malicious client. Results are shown in the given Table 1-1, which illustrates that **injecting backdoor triggers on the surrogate data will also be detected by the proposed method**. \n- (3) **The metric may be tainted**: We have explained that the proposed metric (accuracy on surrogate data) is impervious to variations in the attacker\u2019s ratio, and the supplementary metric has the risk of being tainted. By integrating these two metrics, the proposed method achieves a more potent defense performance.\n- (4) **Small ratio of clients and poisons**: Following your constructive comments, we conducted experiments using a larger attacker ratio, $30/50=60\\%$, and larger poison ratios, $40\\%, 60\\%$, and $80\\%$. Results are shown in the given Tables 1-2 and 1-3 in responses, which further underscore the robust effectiveness of the proposed method in diverse settings.\n- (5) **Filtering thresholds issues**: We have discussed why thresholds vary with time in experiments and how to efficiently adjust them.\n- (6) **Determine the value of b**: According to your insightful question, we explained the value of $b$ used in our paper. We also conducted ablations on the sensitivity of b and report results in Table 1-4, which shows b has a limited impact on the performance.\n- (7) **The ratio of the number of surrogate data**: According to your insightful question, we explained the size of the surrogate dataset in our paper. We also conducted ablations on the sensitivity of the size of the surrogate dataset. The results shown in Table 1-5 in response illustrate that **the proposed method still demonstrates excellent performance even when the surrogate dataset size is only 500**.\n\nWe humbly hope our response has addressed your concerns. If you have any additional concerns or comments that we may have missed in our responses, we would be most grateful for any further feedback from you to help us further enhance our work.\n\nBest regards\n\nAuthors of #1917"

                        "value": "I have read the authors' responses and I appreciated the new results and discussions, which have addressed some of my concerns. However, my biggest concern is still valid, which is,  using a surrogate dataset and heuristic filtering metrics can be easily circumvent by adaptive attackers. I am not convinced by the results on further backdooring surrogate dataset, partly because it is not clear if this attack is adequately implemented. Knowing the filtering metrics, the backdoor attacker can inject this into its objectives by insuring the model accuracy of both surrogate dataset and backdoored task, just as a common backdoor task. Therefore it is still unclear to me how the model accuracy of surrogated dataset are still compromised by large margins in these circumstances.  Also, in Figure 4(c) of the updated manuscript, how come a benign client has also backdoored data (stars) displayed? \nMy second concern is on the filtering thresholds which are critical elements to the methods but are mainly chosen heuristically. I hope there could be more systematical insights to it.   Lastly, the impact of number of surrogate dataset are not comprehensively understood. In the extreme case of 0 surrogate dataset, the problem is reduced to the original backdoor problem, therefore one would expect this number plays a positive role in affecting the defense abilities, but this trend is not seen or explained. Due to these concerns, I will remain my scores."
