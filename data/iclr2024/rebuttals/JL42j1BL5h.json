That is why multilingual safety evaluation of LLMs is very important.\n2. The paper demonstrates that significant safety disparities do exist between languages.\n3. The paper shows that simple prompting strategies can reduce these disparities.\n4. The paper offers a new dataset, which while being machine-translated, has been checked by professional translators.\n5.

Our benchmark relies on a dataset translated from English and Chinese, which may result in biases toward English and Chinese cultures and under-representation of safety issues within the respective cultures.\n2. We employ a self-evaluation method using ChatGPT to determine the safety of LLMs' responses. Although we incorporate human annotations to demonstrate the reliability of this method, it is not entirely accurate, potentially compromising the soundness of our findings.\n3. Our proposed improvement methods are not sufficient to resolve this issue. Further investigation is required to enhance the handling of multilingual safety concerns.\n\nWe include the limitations in the revised paper.\n\n\n\n>**W4**.  *Neither the dataset nor the results (actual model responses) have been provided.*\n\nWe will release all the data and results to facilitate future research on LLMs safety, which we clarify the claim in the contributions in the revised paper.

                    "value": "- The benchmark is based on the work of (Sun et al., 2023), which hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed thus I\u2019m not sure about the validity of the dataset and the broader taxonomy in (Sun et al., 2023). It\u2019s also worth to mention that I read (Sun et al., 2023) but the examples are provided in Chinese without gloss so I can\u2019t access the quality of the dataset in (Sun et al., 2023)\n\n- While the work focuses on evaluating English-centric LLMs, the benchmark is mainly derived from the Chinese dataset in (Sun et al., 2023). This could potentially be biased toward safety assessment in Chinese rather than English. While the authors attempted to remove culture specific (Chinese) aspects from the dataset. It\u2019s unclear to me why this dataset is a good starting point for building the multilingual benchmark As benchmarking is a very important step toward making LLMs more safe, I would expect much of the text dedicated to describe and convince the reader that the benchmark is adequate and well constructed. \n\n- Using chatGPT as an evaluator for safety doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea to me. The authors have stated that safety is a very important issue, to which I agree. As such an important issue, human evaluation should be done rather than using another LLM. Human evaluation is only conducted on 50 samples from Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenarios. What languages do these 50 samples come from? What is the quality of the translation of the responses? 50 samples seem too small for human evaluation and to make a statement about multilingual performance of LLMs. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear if we can trust chatGPT on other scenarios in the taxonomy.\n\n- While this is not a major weakness, the authors tried to provide some estimate about the percentage of language data in each LLMs. While I appreciate this effort, I don\u2019t think Table 4 makes sense. Training data for GPT-2 is **NOT** the training data for chatGPT. And PALM2 training data is **NOT** the training data of PALM. Thus that information is not relevant at all in the paper.\n\n- Finally, I have a meta-concern/question about the setup. If culture specific is removed from the safety benchmark then is it an interesting problem to study? If everything can be mapped to English and the model chooses to respond or not based on its safeguard then is it just a machine translation problem? In the experiment when the prompt asks chatGPT to think in English then answer, is it just a specific instance of implicit translation?"

                        "value": "## Weakness\n\n>**W1**. *The benchmark is based on the work of (Sun et al., 2023), which hasn\u2019t been peer-reviewed.*\n\nWe systematically review all the safety benchmarks for LLMs, from different fields including NLP, Security, and AI. The dataset provided by Sun et al. (2023) is the most comprehensive benchmark including 14 kinds of safety scenarios. We do not choose widely-used benchmarks, especially the dataset from OpenAI and Anthropic, due to the data contamination issue (e.g. these data may have already been trained and aligned).\n\n\n\n>**W2**.  *The benchmark is mainly derived from the Chinese dataset in (Sun et al., 2023). This could potentially be biased toward safety assessment in Chinese rather than English. It\u2019s unclear to me why this dataset is a good starting point for building the multilingual benchmark. I would expect much of the text dedicated to describe and convince the reader that the benchmark is adequate and well constructed.*\n\n\nThere are several methods we have conducted to avoid our benchmark bias toward Chinese cultures. First, we filter out the Chinese-Culture-Related cases and select a high-quality subset from Sun's benchmark. Second, we ask the translator to make necessary modifications on the translation to adapt the benchmark to different languages.\n\n\n\n\n>**W3**.  *Using chatGPT as an evaluator for safety doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea to me. The authors have stated that safety is a very important issue, to which I agree. As such an important issue, human evaluation should be done rather than using another LLM. Human evaluation is only conducted on 50 samples from Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenarios. What languages do these 50 samples come from? What is the quality of the translation of the responses? 50 samples seem too small for human evaluation and to make a statement about multilingual performance of LLMs. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear if we can trust chatGPT on other scenarios in the taxonomy.*\n\nWe annotated the automatic evaluation of LLMs' responses in both Chinese and English. To further validate its reliability, we expanded the scope of human annotation from 200 cases covering 2 languages and 2 safety issues to 1,400 cases, encompassing all 10 languages and 14 safety issues. The accuracy is 88.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of this automatic evaluation method.\n\nIn addition, we utilized a more advanced GPT-4 as the evaluation model. Specifically, we employed GPT-4 to evaluate responses in English, Chinese, and Hindi, with 100 cases randomly selected and annotated where ChatGPT and GPT-4 had differing judgments. The annotation results reveal that ChatGPT is correct in 76 cases, while GPT-4 is correct in 24 cases (primarily due to its over-sensitivity, which led to classifying 70 safe responses as unsafe).\n\nBoth experiments provide evidence that our current self-evaluation method using ChatGPT is reliable.\n\n\n>**W4**.  *The authors tried to provide some estimate about the percentage of language data in each LLMs. While I appreciate this effort, I don\u2019t think Table 4 makes sense. Training data for GPT-2 is NOT the training data for chatGPT. And PALM2 training data is NOT the training data of PALM.*\n\nThank you for pointing it out. We follow your suggestions to modify the claims in the revised paper.\n\n\n>**W5**.  *I have a meta-concern/question about the setup. If culture specific is removed from the safety benchmark then is it an interesting problem to study? If everything can be mapped to English and the model chooses to respond or not based on its safeguard then is it just a machine translation problem? In the experiment when the prompt asks chatGPT to think in English then answer, is it just a specific instance of implicit translation?*\n\n\nEven if culture-specific aspects are removed from the safety benchmark, studying the problem can still be interesting. While it may seem like a machine translation problem, the focus here is on the model's capacity to generalize the safety alignment from English to other languages. As stated in the GPT-4 report (page 61), \"The majority of pretraining data and our alignment data is in English. While there is some evidence that safety mitigations can generalize to other languages, they have not been robustly tested for multilingual performance.\" Our research addresses this gap and reveals that safety mitigations cannot flawlessly generalize to other languages using the constructed multilingual safety benchmark. In other words, current LLMs cannot flawlessly map everything, such as safety mitigations, to English.\n\n\"Think in English then answer\" can be regarded as a specific instance of implicit translation. Implicitly translating the query to English can better evoke the LLMs' capacity of safety mitigation, which is mainly trained in English data. \n\nOverall, the goal is to ensure that AI systems are safe, useful, and respectful of user values in the multilingual scenario, which goes beyond just translation."

Arguably I am being a bit picky here, but given the importance of this topic and the fact that the benchmark could become standard if it is published at a prominent venue such as ICLR, I am a bit hesitant to suggest that the paper be accepted in its current form.\n\n1. All of the text is Google translated from English or Chinese. There is a possibility that translating this data across cultures would result in it not being representative of the harms that appear in those cultures. There is a good example of removing the China-specific safety questions from the Sun et al. dataset.\n2. There is a manual evaluation of 50 instances only from the Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenario indicating 94% accuracy, and it is not clear what language the model was queried in. This is a small number on a very limited subset of the data, so I am not sure how trustworthy this accuracy number is.\n3. There are no actual qualitative examples or data provided with the submission, so I am not able to further validate and understand whether I test the benchmark results or not.\n\nIf the authors could address these concerns about the validity during the response period I would be willing to raise my score, as I do think that the general idea of this benchmark is compelling.\n\n4.

However, the annotation process employed by XSAFETY and the validation of automatic evaluation lack essential details for standard data validation, such as cross-validation, and inter-annotator agreement.\n\n4.

We will leave building more comprehensiveness benchmarks for future work.\n\n\n>**W2**.  *The proposed prompting methods lack novelty and only exhibit marginal improvements on models other than ChatGPT.*\n\nWe want to highlight our main contribution is that our paper is the first to identify and benchmark the multilingual safety issue of LLMs. Although our mitigation method is straightforward and demonstrates some enhancement, it indicates that current prompting techniques are far from resolving this problem. We hope our paper serves as a catalyst for motivating future research.\n\n>**W3**.  *Ensuring accurate annotation in a multilingual dataset is a challenging task that requires a rigorous verification process. The annotation process employed by XSAFETY and the validation of automatic evaluation lack essential details for standard data validation, such as cross-validation, and inter-annotator agreement.*\n\nIn the revised paper (Section 3), we have provided more detailed information on how we ensured the quality of creating multilingual data. Specifically, we conducted two rounds of proofreading by professional translators from a commercial data annotation company to guarantee the accuracy of data translated from Google. The modification rate for the first round was 15.5%, while the second round had a 3.4% modification rate. Subsequently, we randomly inspected 10% of the data, achieving a pass rate greater than 99%.\n\n>**W4**.  *Self-evaluation approach diminishes the reliability of the assessment. To enhance the reliability, additional steps or more advanced models should be explored.*\n\nWe would like to note that employing LLM as an evaluator is a commonly adopted approach in recent papers [1-4]. Furthermore, based on our human annotation, the reliability of self-evaluation using ChatGPT is deemed acceptable (i.e. 94%).\n\nTo further address the reviewer's concerns, we have conducted two additional experiments:\n1. We expanded the scope of human annotation from 200 cases covering 2 languages and 2 safety issues to 1,400 cases, encompassing all 10 languages and 14 safety issues. The accuracy is 88.5%, demonstrating the effectiveness of this automatic evaluation method.\n2. We utilized a more advanced LLM, GPT-4, as the evaluation model. Specifically, we employed GPT-4 to evaluate responses in English, Chinese, and Hindi, with 100 cases randomly selected and annotated where ChatGPT and GPT-4 had differing judgments. The annotation results reveal that ChatGPT is correct in 76 cases, while GPT-4 is correct in 24 cases (primarily due to its over-sensitivity, which led to classifying 70 safe responses as unsafe).\n\nBoth experiments provide evidence that our current self-evaluation method using ChatGPT is reliable.\n\n[1] Vicuna: An Open-Source Chatbot impressing GPT-4 with 90%* ChatGPT Quality\n\n[2] Alpacaeval: An automatic evaluator of instruction-following models\n\n[3] Shadow Alignment: The Ease of Subverting Safely-Aligned Language Models\n\n[4] Fine-tuning Aligned Language Models Compromises Safety, Even When Users Do Not Intend To!"
