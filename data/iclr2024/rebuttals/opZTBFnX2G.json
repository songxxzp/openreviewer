                    "value": "This paper addresses the challenge of fine-tuning pre-trained offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. Specifically, the study introduces a Bayesian approach called BOORL, where the dataset is treated as priors and online interactions are utilized to update posteriors. By sampling actions from these posteriors, this method effectively avoids excessive optimism or pessimism in off-to-on settings. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that BOORL outperforms other baseline methods."

As suggested, we conducted more experiments on the Antmaze tasks.\nThe following table shows that BOORL outperforms various baselines on these challenging tasks.\n\n\n| | BOORL | ODT | Cql-QL | PEX | \n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| antmaze-umaze-v2 | 80.0$\\rightarrow$**100.0** | 55.0$\\rightarrow$85.0 | 80.0$\\rightarrow$**100.0** | 80.0$\\rightarrow$95.0 |\n| antmaze-umaze-diverse-v2 | 75.0$\\rightarrow$**95.0** | 50.0$\\rightarrow$80.0 | 75.0$\\rightarrow$**95.0** | 75.0$\\rightarrow$80.0 |\n| antmaze-medium-play-v2 | 50.0$\\rightarrow$**100.0** | 0.0$\\rightarrow$0.0 |  60.0$\\rightarrow$90.0 | 70.0$\\rightarrow$85.0 |\n| antmaze-medium-diverse-v2 | 60.0$\\rightarrow$**85.0** | 0.0$\\rightarrow$0.0 | 70.0$\\rightarrow$**85.0** | 60.0$\\rightarrow$**85.0** |\n| antmaze-large-play-v2 | 60.0$\\rightarrow$**75.0** | 0.0$\\rightarrow$0.0 | 25.0$\\rightarrow$55.0 | 50.0$\\rightarrow$55.0|\n| antmaze-large-diverse-v2 | 50.0$\\rightarrow$**80.0** | 0.0$\\rightarrow$0.0 | 35.0$\\rightarrow$70.0 | 45.0$\\rightarrow$55.0|\n\nTable 1.

                    "value": "(Some of the points are questions rather than weaknesses).\n\n1. The presentation of the theory results could be improved. Some details are left out and some indication of the theory results could be better explained. For example, the theory algorithm that is used to give the results in Thm 3.2 (and generate the results of Fig. 2) is not given so it is a little bit hard to contextualize the results. Is the algorithm running TS-LCB in the offline stage and switch to TS in the online stage? \n\n2. From my understanding, the proposition 3.3 is trying to argue that using UCB in online stage will cause the performance drop? I am not sure that one-step suboptimality corresponds exactly to the \"performance drop\".\n\n3. It would be helpful is any explanation why TS is performing better than theory in Fig. 2. \n\n4. At the ending remark of the theory section, the paper mentions that [Song et al., 2022] benefits only when offline data has sufficient coverage, but to my best knowledge it seems that [Song et al., 2022] indeed requires and benefit from sufficient coverage from offline data. So to my understanding the current paper is achieving a best-of-both-world (kind of, not exactly) results of [Xie et al, 2021] and [Song et al., 2022]. \n\n5. The current coverage is not the tightest in the linear case. Is the tightest coverage (as in [1]) applicable in the current analysis?\n\n6. Some indexing on $h$ seems to be off in eq 3. Also in eq 4, are the linear features not $h$-dependent?\n\n### References\n[1] Zanette, Andrea, Martin J.

                        "value": "We thank the Reviewer for the constructive comments and provide clarification to your concerns as follows. We would appreciate it if you have any further feedback.\n\n**W1: The theory algorithm that is used to give the results in Thm 3.2 (and generate the results of Fig. 2) is not given, is the algorithm running TS-LCB in the offline stage and switch to TS in the online stage?**\n\n**A for W1:**\nWe thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. TS uses the same algorithm over the two stages, using all the data available to update its posterior and samples from its posterior to generate a policy during execution. In the offline phase, TS uses all offline data to update its posterior, while in the online phase, TS uses both offline data and online data to update its posterior. Others are kept the same as the vanilla TS algorithm. \n\n\n**W2: Is the Proposition 3.3 trying to argue that using UCB in online stage will cause the performance drop? and How the one-step suboptimality corresponds exactly to the performance drop?**\n\n**A for W2:**\nProposition 3.3 is used to show that there is no per-episode performance guarantee for UCB (but a cumulative regret guarantee) due to optimistic exploration, and the performance for one episode can be arbitrarily worse when the online phase starts. On the contrary, offline learned policy has an $O(1/\\sqrt{N})$ per-episode performance guarantee. Therefore, Proposition 3.3 explains why changing the offline algorithm to an online one can lead to a performance drop at the early stage.\n\n**W3: Why TS is performing better than theory in Figure 2?**\n\n**A for W3:**\nThe main reason is that the theory only provides an **upper bound** for the regret. There are other factors, like the choice of the priors, that can affect the overall performance of TS.\n\n\n**W4: The statement at the ending remark of the theory section.**\n\n**A for W4:**\nWe thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. More precisely, Xie et al., 2021 analyze the benefit of online exploration when offline data only has partial coverage, while Song et al., 2022 propose Hy-Q, which has an oracle property ($O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret compared with **any** policy $\\pi_e$) and is computationally efficient by incorporating offline data. Unlike the previous results, our result shows that using offline data with full coverage can improve over the $O(\\sqrt{T})$ online regret bound by adopting a Bayesian method. We made this point more clear in the revised version.\n\n**W5: Is the tightest coverage applicable in the current analysis?**\n\n**A for W5:**\nYes, our analysis is based on a general information-theoretic argument, independent of the notion of coverage. Our analysis generally applies to various notions of coverage coefficient, including [1,2].\n\n**W6: In Equation 3 the index for $h$ are off. In Equation 4, are the linear features not $h$-dependent?**\n\n**A for W6:**\nWe thank the Reviewer for pointing it out, and we have corrected it in the revised version. A $h$-independent feature is usually assumed as in previous linear MDP literature [3,4]. We can concatenate $h$-dependent features for all $H$ steps to get an $h$-independent one so that $h$-dependent features are a special case of our definition.\n\nThanks again for the valuable comments.\nWe hope our response has cleared your concerns.\nWe are looking forward to more discussion.\n\n\n[1] Zanette, Andrea, Martin J.

An information-theoretic guarantee for regret is presented. For practical algorithms, in the offline phase, an ensemble of policies is trained with bootstrap mask; in the online phase, at each step a policy is sampled from the ensemble to perform actions, and the collected data is used to update each policy network in the ensemble. The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance when benchmarked against existing algorithms."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, \n\nThanks for your positive and insightful comments.\nWe provide clarification to your concerns below. We would appreciate it if you have any further feedback.\n\n**W1: Explicitly citing the literature.**\n\n**A for W1:**\nThanks for your comment. We have corrected it in the modified version.\n\n**W2:  The formal definition of the information ratio.**\n\n**A for W2:**\nWe thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. The information ratio $\\Gamma_t$ is the ratio between the suboptimality and the information gain [6]. We have added a concrete definition for $\\Gamma_t$ in the Definition 2.2 in the revised version. \n\n**W3.1: The experimental setting in Figure 2 / Appendix E. What is the algorithm applied in the offline phase for UCB and LCB? Wouldn't a fair comparison for TS be using LCB in the offline phase and UCB in the online phase?**\n\n**A for W3.1:** \n\nWe would like to clarify that there is no explicit \"offline\" stage for offline-to-online RL, theoretically. The choice of algorithms in the offline phase does not change the overall regret curve since it only affects the performance at step 0. For UCB/LCB algorithms, we treat all the offline data as past online experiences to calculate the statistics. For example, when we have $M$ offline data points and $N$ online data points for some arm $a$, then we use these $N+M$ data points to estimate $\\mu(a)$ and $\\sigma(a)$ and choose the best arm to act according to the UCB/LCB principle. We let all algorithms use both offline and online data to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n\n**W3.2: Explicitly state the bandit setting.**\n\n**A for W3.2:**\nIn the bandit setting, we let each arm $a_n$ have a probability $\\theta_n$ to yield a reward of 1 and a probability $1-\\theta_n$ to yield a reward of 0. The parameters $\\theta_n$ are i.i.d. drawn from a Beta distribution for all arms $a_n$. We use 10 arms and 1000 offline data points, and the online phase lasts for 100000 steps. \nWe have included the implementation for the bandit settings in the supplementary material to ensure better replication.\n\n**W4: Typo issue.**\n\n**A for W4:**\nThanks for your comment. We have corrected it in the revised version.\n\n**W5: Include additional implementation specs for each experiment.**\n\n**A for W5:**\nAs suggested, we have added additional implementation specs in the revised version of Appendix I. Specifically, we use the proposed bootstrapping mechanism in [1] for approximate posterior updates. Mutual information is needed for the theoretical analysis rather than for the empirical implementation. There are various methods like [2] for computing approximate mutual information for theoretical verification.\n\n**W6: Why do ODT and Off2On have zero score on Antmaze tasks?**\n\n**A for W6:**\nAntmaze tasks are challenging for exploration, so it is important to use offline data properly to complete the tasks. At the offline stage, ODT is based on DT, which is known to fail on Antmaze tasks [3], while Off2On is built on CQL, which has similar issues [4].\n\n\n**W7: Could the author provide some discussion or proof sketch for the nonlinear case?**\n\n**A for W7:**\nWhile Section 3.2 focuses on linear MDPs, Section 3.1 provides an information-theoretic analysis generally applicable to different MDP structures. To apply for the nonlinear setting, we need to analyze the information ratio $\\Gamma_t$ (defined in Definition 2.2) for nonlinear settings, and others are kept the same. In linear settings, $\\Gamma$ is a constant, while it can be a function of $t$ in general settings. For example, for Gaussian kernel MDPs, $\\Gamma_t=O(\\log t)$ [5] and the regret bound will be increased by a factor of $log T$ correspondingly.\n\n**W8: Would the same analysis framework apply to the naive extension? (e.g., pessimistic TS in the offline phase and optimistic TS in the online phase)**\n\n**A for W8:**\n\nAs discussed in W3, the choice of algorithms in the offline stage theoretically does not change the overall performance. While optimistic TS provides a nice frequentist guarantee compared to vanilla TS, it suffers from the same issue as UCB, which can lead to a significant performance drop at an early stage due to optimistic exploration.\n\n\nThanks again for the valuable comments.\nWe sincerely hope our response has addressed your concerns."

However, I still have some concerns.\n1. As we all know, the ensemble trick is helpful in improving the performance of RL methods and is widely used in practice. It seems that it is unfair to use an approach with the ensemble method to compare with other methods without the ensemble. I wondering if there is an ablation study to show the performance of an ensemble version of TD3 or TD3+BC. \n\n2. The key part of the algorithm is not clear. Specifically, the mask m samples from a distribution M. What is the format of M and how does it initialize and update? what is the difference between the usage of m compared to the original ensemble method? In the online part, it seems that the distribution M can be seen as the priori according definition of Bayesian. However, the authors choose to use uniform distribution to choose policy, which is the same as the original ensemble method. Could the authors explain it?"

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer, \n\nThanks for your valuable comments. We have provided additional experimental results and explanations to address your concerns, and we hope the following clarifications shed light on the points you raised.\n\n\n**C1: Is there an ablation study to show the performance of an ensemble version of TD3 or TD3+BC?**\n\n**A for C1:** \nAs suggested, we conduct ablation studies to investigate the performance of the ensemble versions of TD3 and TD3+BC.\nSpecifically, we use an ensemble version of TD3+BC during the offline phase and adopt the ensemble versions of TD3 and TD3+BC during the online fine-tuning phase.\nThe experimental results of the following table show that BOORL significantly outperforms these baselines. Different from these baselines, BOORL adopts a bootstrapping mechanism where each agent uses a different dataset sampled uniformly with replacement from the original dataset. This mechanism is critical in improving offline-to-online performance, as shown in the ablation study in Appendix H.1.\n\n\n| | BOORL | TD3 (Ensemble) | TD3+BC (Ensemble) |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| hopper-random-v2 | **75.7$\\pm$1.3** | 20.2$\\pm$3.4 | 8.0$\\pm$3.6 |\n| hopper-medium-v2 | **109.8$\\pm$1.6** | 93.2$\\pm$1.4 | 54.2$\\pm$1.6 |\n| hopper-medium-replay-v2 | **111.1$\\pm$0.3** | 98.0$\\pm$0.7 | 66.5$\\pm$2.6 |\n| walker2d-random-v2 | **93.6$\\pm$0.4** | 2.2$\\pm$0.2 | 1.7$\\pm$0.1 |\n| walker2d-medium-v2 | **107.7$\\pm$0.5** | 78.2$\\pm$2.2 | 81.8$\\pm$2.4 |\n| walker2d-medium-replay-v2 | **114.4$\\pm$0.9** | 79.3$\\pm$1.2 | 82.6$\\pm$1.8 |\n| halfcheetah-random-v2 | **97.7$\\pm$1.1** | 65.9$\\pm$0.5 | 38.7$\\pm$0.2 |\n| halfcheetah-medium-v2 | **98.7$\\pm$0.3** | 70.5$\\pm$1.0 | 51.9$\\pm$0.5 |\n| halfcheetah-medium-replay-v2 | **91.5$\\pm$0.9** | 71.1$\\pm$1.1 | 50.8$\\pm$0.8 |\n\nTable 1. Comparison results between BOORL and the ensemble version of TD3 and TD3+BC with the normalized score metric, averaged over five random seeds with standard deviation.\n\n**C2.1: What is the format of M, and how does it initialize and update? Why use the uniform distribution to choose a policy in the online part?**\n\n**A for C2.1:**\nWe process the mask distribution consistent with [1] to simulate the bootstrapping process. \nSpecifically, $ M$ is a Bernoulli distribution with a parameter $ p$, and we sample mask $ m_1, m_2,..., m_N$ i.i.d. from Bernoulli ($ p$). Therefore, each mask generates a bootstrapped dataset (i.e., iid sampling with replacement) from the original one. We draw new masks for each new online data point when it is added to the replay buffer, but the masks are not updated after that.\nEach policy trained with one bootstrapped dataset can be seen as a sample from the posterior [1]. Therefore\n uniformly choosing a policy in the sampled set of $N$ policies is an approximation of sampling from the posterior from a Bayesian point of view.\n\n\n\n\n**C2.2: What is the difference between the usage of m compared to the original ensemble method?**\n\n**A for C2.2:**\n\nThe original ensemble method uses the same dataset and different initialization of neural networks to train ensembled policies. While this method can reduce variance, it does not properly reflect epistemic uncertainty [3]. The usage of the mask is derived from the bootstrapping method where each policy uses its own dataset, i.i.d. sampled with replacement from the original dataset. This helps diversify the policies and can reflect the posterior properly.\n\nThanks again for the valuable comments.\nWe sincerely hope our additional explanation of the experimental setup has cleared the concern.\nMore comments on further improving the presentation are welcomed.\n\n[1] Osband, Ian, et al. \"Deep exploration via bootstrapped DQN.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 29 (2016).\n\n[2] Chen, Xinyue, et al. \"Randomized Ensembled Double Q-Learning: Learning Fast Without a Model.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020.\n\n[3] Chua, Kurtland, et al. \"Deep reinforcement learning in a handful of trials using probabilistic dynamics models.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018)."
