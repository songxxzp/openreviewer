                    "value": "The paper focused on the task of temporal knowledge graph (facts) extrapolation (prediction). The main contribution is to make historical facts selection by employing LMs. The selected historical facts are combined with textual information and LMs to predict time-related facts more precisely. The main contributions include 1) Exploiting an LM-based method for historical facts selection; 2) devising an adaptive prompt and pruned subgraph for temporal reasoning; 3) Proposing a layer-wise modality interaction with an attention-based residual fusion module. The authors also conduct experimental comparisons on five open-shared datasets. The results show that the proposed methods could obtain SOTA performance than existing TKG methods, LLM, and LM+KG models."

Several different kinds of baselines are selected which makes the results more convincing."

Knowledge could not be regarded as a kind of modality.\n\n3) In the introduction part, what the is behind reasons about \"the sufficient structured semantics of TKG can hardly be represented by semantic-agnostic GNNs\".  The authors should explain it more clearly.\n\n4) The authors should give out the experimental results of fine-tuned LLMs and Graph/KG enhanced LM models for the other three datasets."

For example, if we never know the president of the USA in 2020, how could we predict it according to all the presidential information of USA in the history?\n\n2) In equation (7), why the contexts should be [t,s,r] rather than [s,r,t] or [s,t,r]?\n\n3) How about the performance goes when we use LLMs with different parameter sizes, such as LLaMa-13b or 65b? How about the performance of ChatGPT or GPT-4?\n\n4) Where are the texts come from in the equation (3)?"

One challenge of the previous paper is that it failed to leverage any neighborhood information. By using the multi-modal learning, the author addressed this problem. \n\nS4. It is also worth noting that the paper introduces a new general direction on combining GNN and LM. Previous works mostly leverage the LM in a heuristic way by applying descriptive graph languages on LM. This work minimized the heuristic part and was able to optimize the strategy through the joint optimization."
