Incorporating superpixels into the neural nets has been well studied, and the essential difference between the proposed module and previous studies is updating the pixel feature. However, the proposed module is not compared with other clustering modules (e.g., SSN[1] and GroupViT), and the advantage of the proposed module is not verified.\n\n2. The authors discussed the existing architecture using superpixel representation, but the authors compare the proposed method only with patch-based architecture, and there is no comparison in the experiments. In fact, the accuracy of the proposed method on ImageNet-1k is worse than that of SViT[3].\n\n3. I wonder how useful explainability is. Visualizing superpixels just shows similar pixels and does not explain why the model makes the decision. The similarity can also be visualized by clustering pixels in post-processing.\n\n[1] Jampani, Varun, et al. \"Superpixel sampling networks.\" 2018  \n[2] Xu, Jiarui, et al. \"Groupvit: Semantic segmentation emerges from text supervision.\" 2022  \n[3] Huang, Huaibo, et al. \"Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling\" 2023"

                    "value": "Section 3.1.: There are a couple of things that are confusing. First of all, the notation is unorthodox, with ph/pw (or sh/sw) the authors probably mean subscripted p_h, p_w rather than its multiplicative interpretation. Equation (1) is also confusing as it is unclear what \u201cp\u201d really denotes. Assuming that \u201cp\u201d is a spatial coordinate (e.g. (x, y)), we run into the problem that the last dimensions of S_f are sh x sw, while they are h x w for S_a. This should be made clearer, e.g. with the help of an illustration as this deviates from the \u201ccommon\u201d definition of superpixels. It should also be defined how the \u201cn\u201d dimension is to be interpreted, is it a one-hot dimension?\nUnfortunately, the latter weakness makes it very difficult to follow the rest of the paper as the next equations become very specific without providing much intuition. The illustrations are only partially helpful.\nSPFormer is only compared against DeIT (and S-ViT in the Appendix). Comparing the model against a single model in the main paper is insufficient and would suggest adding more recent models (more recent DeIT derivates or Swin transformers). \nGiven that SPFormers are claimed to be a more efficient model class it would have been interesting to see how well they perform if the resolution is increased. This could be done in comparison to other transformer models that would be expected to perform worse\nTypo(s): \u201cadjustbable\u201d in the conclusion"

According to the original paper of Huang et al., the accuracy of SViT on ImageNet is higher than 83.6% whereas the accuray of SViT reported in this work is 80.7%. This significant difference should be better explained.\n* The experiments for transferability are limited.
