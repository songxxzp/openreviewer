                    "value": "This paper proposes Imprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (ICBL) for continual learning under large number of preferences. Unlike other approaches which have to learn a model for each preference, ICBL can handle arbitrary number of preferences under limited compute by updating a knowledge base (aggregated over tasks) as a convex hull over model parameters. As only extreme point of the hull have to be stored, this can be done with lower memory requirements. Leveraging this knowledge base, preference-addressing models can be generated without training, and have guarantees w.r.t. Pareto optimal parameters.\nResults on four image classification and NLP benchmarks show convincing results with effectively no negative backward transfer."

                    "value": "In this section, I include both issues I have with the paper, and general questions regarding my understanding of the proposed approach.\n\n__Weaknesses__\n\n* The paper itself is too dense - a lot of the crucial intuition and motivation is moved to the appendix, which makes the main paper very difficult to parse, for example\n\t* Separation and placement in literature of the proposed method IBCL and MAML/BMAML (App. A).\n\t* The reason for working in a bayesian CL setting (App. B)\n\t* The importance of the particular task similarity assumption (App. E)\n\t* Limited discussion on how preferences are formalized (App. G)\n\t* Very basic experimental details on the CL experiments (App. J)\nWithout continuously looking at the supplementary, understanding both key elements of the method and its motivation become in parts near impossible. This specifically refers to the reason behind bayesian CL, and details regarding the made assumptions. It would be great to see that changed.\n\n* The proposed setup seems contrived - in particular the continual aspect, with both examples provided in the introduction primarily highlighting the multi-task nature of the problem. The continual aspect seems to be mostly a sidenote (e.g. \"preference may even change over time\"). Similarly, the authors only provide limited references for the relevance of the described problem scenario where a large number of preferences has to be accounted for continually over time. It would be great if the authors could offer some more clarity here.\n\n* I may be missing something here, but the authors list poorly performing models to also be sampled from the HDRs, and require separate evaluation on a withheld validation set. This seems like a rather crucial point to elaborate on - what exactly is the rate of poorly performing models, and how dependent is ICBL on selection using validation metrics?\n\n* The experimental studies are limited, and only compares to a single continual learning method, while not providing any context as to why GEM was selected in particular. Are other methods not suitable for this scenario? Similarly, can ICBL not be deployed on standard, single-preference continual learning benchmarks? This would be great to understand, and if not, why. \n\n\n__Questions__\n\n\n* What drives the definition of the Assumption 1 for Task Similarity? In particular, how close it is to a realistic assumption (in particular F being a convex subset of \\Delta_{xy})? Conceptual motivation for such a key assumption would make it easier to grasp the proposed approach quicker.\n\n* Intuitively, it seems like the diameter of the convex subsets F (r) could connect to the expected continuous distribution shifts that can be handled. Is that right? And generally, how does the choice of r drive/change the behaviour/applicability of ICBL?"

                        "value": "We appreciate your thoughtful feedback, and we invite you to read our revised manuscript, which significantly improves readability and addresses your concerns. \n\n\u201cThe paper itself is too dense.\u201d\n\nWe have improved readability in our revised manuscript. Please also refer to our comment to everyone for a list of our modifications. \n\n\u201cThe proposed setup seems contrived.\u201d\n\nOur setup is simplified and clarified in the revised manuscript. Please read our revised version of the Introduction for a better structured story.\n\n\u201cPoorly performing models can also be sampled from HDRs.\u201d\n\nWe are able to completely avoid sampling these models by modifying the hyperparameter alpha. Please refer to our ablation studies in Appendix H.3 of the revised manuscript, where we are able to always sample near Pareto-optimal models with a small alpha (0.01). In fact, avoiding poor models does not depend on validation at all, and we made this correction in our latest manuscript.\n\n\u201cThe experimental studies are limited.\u201d\n\nWe have added experiments based on the suggestions of reviewer 79Li. As in our revised manuscript, GEM and A-GEM are selected because they are rehearsal-based, and there is an established method to specify task preferences on rehearsal-based continual learning \u2013 that is, using preferences as weights on loss functions. The other methods, such as prompt-based continual learning, have no standard way to specify a task preference so far. In our revised experiments, we made an attempt to use a preference-weighted sum of prompts in L2P, but it ended up with poor performance except for the CelebA benchmark.\n\n\u201cCan IBCL be deployed to single-preference benchmarks?\u201d\n\nYes. We can request IBCL to generate models for any number of preferences (including one preference only), and the total training overhead (measured in number of batch updates) remains constant, regardless of the number of preferences requested.\n\n\u201cWhat drives the assumption of task similarity?\u201d\n\nTask similarity assumption is needed to mitigate the possible model misspecification, which in turn could lead to catastrophic forgetting even when Bayesian inference is carried out exactly. This is now explicitly mentioned after presenting Assumption 1, and discussed in more depth in Appendix E.\n\n\u201cDoes the diameter of F(r) connect to the expected continuous distribution shifts that can be handled? How does the choice of r affect the applicability of IBCL?\u201d\n\nYes: assuming a bounded diameter implies that the tasks are somehow close to each other. In other words, the distribution shift between the distributions for task i and j, p_i and p_j respectively, must not be too pronounced. If we were to allow arbitrary differences between the tasks the agent needs to accomplish, as a consequence of IBCL being embedded in a Bayesian framework, we may incur catastrophic forgetting. As pointed out in Appendix E, in the future, we will generalize IBCL to ProtoCL instead of Bayesian learning to let go of Assumption 1. Having a bounded diameter does not limit the applicability of IBCL, since in the majority of applications the tasks we want to accomplish are reasonably similar to each other. This is for example the case of classification, where Assumption 1 should always be satisfied, with a reasonably small diameter r.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your comments and hope the rating can be adjusted accordingly."

In particular, I very much appreciate the motivational changes in the introduction (especially the example), which motivate the problem setting a lot better.\nThis translates to the overall writing of the paper, which has notably improved, and is now much easier to parse and understand:\n* The change in Fig. 1 is much easier to parse, and aligns better with the motivational example.\n* The overall method description & motivation reads much better, with Alg.1 now quicker to understand and less cluttered. More importantly however, it is now well integrated into the main text, and each key step is explained. This allowed me to understand the method in more detail - I very much appreciate that.\n \nOverall, the paper now is much more self-contained and comprehensively written. As a consequence, I now do believe that the problem setup of continual learning that cheaply accounts for preference changes is a sensible one, and the proposed approach of particular interest to the research community. As such, I have raised my score to 6. I will be happy to raise it to 8 if the remaining issues (see below) are addressed.\n\n\n__Remaining notes on my end:__\n* The paper now only stands at 7.5 pages - so a lot of context was cut (and moved to the appendix), such as the additional benchmark results. Especially the latter should still be included in the paper, as opposed to results on a single benchmark. With all the positive changes w.r.t. the paper writing, the experimental section still reads as a sidenote unfortunately - an issue exacerbated by the removal of experimental results. These should be included, and discussed in more detail. Similarly, ablation studies on the two key hyperparameters should definitely be incorporated in the main paper, as it is otherwise very difficult to experimental understand hyperparameter choice impact, and the corresponding method dependency.\n* Could the authors elaborate more on the differences in backward transfer in Fig. 2, especially compared to VCL.\n* It would be great to reference Alg. 1/2 in Alg. 3.\n* The Theorem-formatting is off.\n* I do wish Table and Figure captions (particularly Fig. 2, Tab. 1) were actually self-contained."

Due to time constraints, we are unable to finish working on the other baselines you suggested, but we will keep working on them.\n\nWe indeed believe CLIP [3] is a well-established zero-shot approach. However, it requires natural languages as prompts, which is unavailable in our settings. Therefore, we choose L2P, where prompts are trainable parameters. \n\nOur new experiments show that IBCL is able to obtain high continual learning performance, thanks to its probabilistic Pareto-optimality. Moreover, it is able to maintain a constant training overhead per task, regardless of how many preferences are requested. Compared to rehearsal-based baselines, like GEM and A-GEM, the performance is not worsened while the training overhead is significantly reduced. \n\nAlthough prompt-based baselines, like L2P, also achieves constant training overhead per task, IBCL has a much higher performance overall. This is due to the fact that there is no standard way of specifying preferences over tasks to prompt-based methods, and we made an attempt to train one prompt per task, and use a preference-weighted sum of the learned prompts to specify a preference. The resulting performance is poor except for on the CelebA benchmark. As a consequence, we point out how specifying task preferences in prompt-based continual learning can be a future research direction.\n\nAgain, we appreciate your comments that helped us improve the overall quality of the manuscript, and we sincerely hope you can update the rating accordingly.\n\n[1] Chaudhry, Arslan, et al. \"Efficient lifelong learning with a-gem.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.00420 (2018).\n\n[2] Wang, Zifeng, et al. \"Learning to prompt for continual learning.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022.\n\n[3] Radford, Alec, et al. \"Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision.\" International conference on machine learning.

We have updated a further revised manuscript that addresses your concerns.\n\n\u201cThe HDR concept is not immediately clear.\u201d\n\nWe modified Figure 1 as well as the paragraph right after it. In Figure 1, the full names of FGCS and HDR are provided. In the paragraph, we give a more detailed description about what FGCS and HDR are. We also added a reference to Section 2 at the end of the paragraph, to show where formal definitions can be found.\n\n\u201cA more detailed explanation of how IBCL differed from [1] [2] would be beneficial.\u201d\n\nWe detailed this explanation in the last two paragraphs before \u201cContributions\u201d in the Introduction. That is, compared to existing efficient knowledge transfer methods like [1], IBCL enables learning models under specified task trade-off preferences. Compared to existing methods that enable specified preferences like [2], IBCL is not only much more efficient by maintaining a constant training overhead per task, but also guarantees probabilistic Pareto optimality. Moreover, IBCL is a Bayesian CL method, hence it mitigates catastrophic forgetting by design. We prove this and discuss Bayesian CL at length in Appendix A.\n\n\u201cWhy not choose a smaller alpha, e.g. 0.001?\u201d\n\nIndeed, a smaller alpha is more preferable. However, when alpha becomes very small, like 0.01, we already have a very high probability of sampling the Pareto-optimal model, and this probability can be hardly improved by using an even smaller alpha. For example, in Figure 2, the shaded blue area that illustrates IBCL\u2019s performance range has already converged to a single curve. This means that the worst sampled model and the best sampled model (Pareto-optimal model) have a negligible difference. Therefore, there is no need to keep shrinking down this difference by using a smaller alpha.\n\nWe sincerely hope that you can consider improving the rating based on the changes. Thank you in advance.\n\n[1] Learning the Pareto Front with Hypernetworks.\n\n[2] Controllable Pareto Multi-task Learning."

There are many similar works based on entropy, loss, and other metrics (please refer to [b]). What advantages do they have over the other? Most of the earlier work used fixed/constant size buffers, which is better than sublinear growth. When the results are evaluated, IBCL has sublinear growth; however, the compared method GEM/A-GEM uses a fixed-size buffer. In this scenario, how do the authors ensure a fair comparison? Also, the L2P is a replay-free model, which is not a fair comparison since the model used the replay buffer. What is the buffer growth rate, and how does the performance change with the sublinear growth? \n2. The baseline papers are outdated; the recent work shows much better results even without replay samples. Please include the recent replay-based model in the baseline. Also, the L2P (is only a recent model) is a replay-free prompting-based model and there are many updated prompting-based approaches [a, c], etc. which should be included in the baseline. \n3. The motivation behind the probabilistic Pareto-optimality is not clear. Why is it important for continual learning? \n4. There are no clear descriptions about the HDR computation, i.e., how Algo-2, line-5 computes the HDR? It looks like Preference HDR Computation is expensive, and as the task grows, the complexity increases. Please discuss its computation method and complexity. \n5.

                        "value": "Thank you for your comments. We believe there are some misunderstandings in our work, and we are happy to address them here. We would also appreciate the reviewer to refer to the comments and our discussions with the other three reviewers. First, for the weaknesses:\n\n**1. \u201cIn Algorithm-1 paper shows the FGCS Knowledge Base Update, which is based on some distance \u2026 There are many similar works based on entropy, loss, and other metrics.\u201d**\n\nThis distance-based distribution selection is not the main focus of this paper. We use this as a convenient subroutine to exclude distributions that are very similar to what is already cached, so that we have a sublinear buffer growth. Our main contribution is modeling the representation learned in continual learning as an FGCS, which allows zero-shot identification of probabilistically Pareto-optimal models.\n\n**2. \u201cThe paper is motivated as we have a large number of users, and the model is scalable for the larger number, but the results are shown only for the 5/10 task, which is small and does not align with the motivation.\u201d**\n\nThe number of tasks and the number of preferences are two different concepts. We can have a small number of tasks, but with each task we have a large number of preferences. These two numbers are distinguished by $n_{pref}$ and $i$ in our Table 1.\n\n**3. \u201cThe baseline papers are outdated.\u201d**\n\nWe have explained the baseline selection in Section 5.1, as well as an explanation in the last paragraph before Figure 1 in Section 1 (\u201cHowever, we identify two major disadvantages \u2026\u201d). That is, so far, people can only specify preferences over tasks on rehearsal-based continual learning algorithms, by using a preference-weighted sum on the losses of the rehearsal memory, making them comparable to IBCL. The \"new\" and \u201cefficient\u201d algorithms, such as model-based or prompt-based algorithms, do not enable an input of preferences. However, we still made an attempt to input preferences to L2P after the discussion with reviewer 79Li. This is a relatively new prompt-based method for comparison.\n\n**4. \u201cThe ablation results are insufficient to evaluate the model.\u201d**\n\nWe would appreciate the reviewer to point out how to make the ablation studies sufficient. We conduct these ablations by using different hyperparameters $d$ and $\\alpha$ and the results already show a clear trend of how the performance can be affected. The training procedure is exactly the same as in the main experiments, which is detailed in Section 5.1 and Appendix H, just with different hyperparameters given.\n\nThen, for the justification in weaknesses:\n\n**5. \u201cThe claim in the motivation is not supported in the experiments.\u201d**\n\nOur experiments already show that IBCL can achieve high continual learning performance metrics, supporting the claim of probabilistic Pareto-optimality. We have also analyzed its overhead in Table 1, supporting the claim of zero-shot model generation under preferences. We are not sure why the reviewer thinks the claim is not supported.\n\n**6. \u201c Lack of motivation about Pareto-optimality.\u201d**\n\nPareto-optimality is a common goal in multi-objective optimization, which is the nature of multi-task and continual learning. This motivation is already well supported by the cited previous work. Please refer to Kendall et al. 2018, Sener and Koltun 2018, Lin et al. 2019 and Lin et al. 2020, cited in our introduction section.\n\n**7. \u201cThe computation of the HDR are not discussed.\u201d**\n\nThe computation of HDR is an established standard procedure, which we explain right after Theorem 4 and cite Juan et al. 2022 for an R package that implements it. This is also not our focus in this paper. In practice, we use Gaussians to model the parameter distributions, and we select an interval, with the lower and upper bounds symmetrically on the two sides of the mean, such that the enclosed probability density function has an integral = 1 - $\\alpha$. The two bounds are computed as the inverse cumulative density function (icdf) of a Gaussian at the quantiles of 0.5 - (1 - $\\alpha$) / 2 and 0.5 + (1 - $\\alpha$) / 2. A Gaussian\u2019s icdf can be very fast computed by tools like scipy."
