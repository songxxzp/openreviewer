                    "value": "The paper introduces Text2NKG, a novel framework for fine-grained n-ary relation extraction in the construction of n-ary relational knowledge graphs (NKGs). It addresses the limitations of manual labor in NKG construction and the coarse-grained nature of n-ary relation extraction. Text2NKG employs a span-tuple classification method with hetero-ordered merging to extract n-ary relations with high precision. It supports various NKG schemas, including hyper-relational, event-based, role-based, and hypergraph-based schemas. Experimental results demonstrate that Text2NKG surpasses previous state-of-the-art models by nearly 20% in F1 scores, particularly in the hyper-relational schema.\n\nContributions:\n1. Text2NKG: The paper proposes a novel framework, which automates the extraction of n-ary relational facts from natural language text to construct NKGs.\n\n2. Fine-grained n-ary relation extraction: Text2NKG introduces a span-tuple multi-label classification method with hetero merging, enabling precise extraction of n-ary relations with different arities.\n\n3. Support for diverse NKG schemas: Text2NKG accommodates four typical NKG schemas, enhancing flexibility and practicality in knowledge graph construction."

Text2NKG offers a significant advancement in automating the extraction of n-ary relational facts from natural language text. This automation reduces the reliance on manual labor, making the construction of n-ary relational knowledge graphs (NKGs) more efficient and scalable.\n\n2. The framework introduces a fine-grained approach to n-ary relation extraction. By employing a span-tuple multi-label classification method with hetero merging, Text2NKG can handle n-ary relations of different arities. This precision in extraction is crucial for capturing nuanced relationships in complex datasets.\n\n3. Text2NKG stands out in its versatility, as it supports four typical NKG schemas, including hyper-relational, event-based, role-based, and hypergraph-based schemas. This flexibility enables the framework to be applied across a wide range of domains and use cases, making it highly adaptable to various real-world applications.\n\n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow and The examples given in the article can help to better understand the paper.\nIt embodies the spirit of open source and contribution.\n\nThe development of Text2NKG has broader implications for the field of knowledge representation and reasoning."

                    "value": "Weaknesses:\n\n1. While the extension of the HyperRED dataset is a valuable contribution, the paper could benefit from additional experimentation on a wider range of datasets, especially in diverse domains. This would further validate the framework's performance and applicability across various knowledge graph construction scenarios.\n\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed discussion for the computational resources required to implement Text2NKG. This information is crucial for practitioners and researchers to understand the feasibility and potential resource constraints associated with adopting the framework. \n\n3. The paper does not extensively discuss potential overfitting issues. Since fine-grained relation extraction involves complex pattern recognition, it is essential to address how Text2NKG generalizes to new, unseen data, especially in real-world, noisy text environments.\n\n4. While Text2NKG demonstrates substantial improvements over the previous state-of-the-art model, CubeRE, a more comprehensive comparison with a wider range of alternative approaches would provide a more complete assessment of its relative strengths and weaknesses.\n\n5. The paper does not explicitly address potential biases that may arise during the relation extraction process. Natural language data can contain biases that may be inadvertently learned by the model, which could impact the quality of the extracted relations.\n\n6. The technical details are not described clearly and somehow seems lack of novelty.\n\nOverall, the workload of this paper is not particularly large, and the complexity is not that high.\nThe experiments and diagrams mentioned in the article are not so sufficient. More experimental materials can be provided to form a strong support for the experimental results.\nThe article lacks discussion on the limitations of the model and could briefly describe its potential defects and areas for future improvement.\nAn overview of Text2NKG described in Figure 3 should be a very important diagram for the article, but the architecture of the entire model seems to be not regular enough, and there are not many annotations in the diagram, such as solid tokens \"[S] and [/S]\" for entity delimitation and annotations for levitated markers \"[L] and [/L]\".\nIn METHODOLOGY, there is a lack of detailed description of the working principle of the linear classifier FNN. In addition, the introduction in the OUTPUT MERGING part is too general. It is best to describe the novel method proposed in this article in detail so that readers can better understand it.\nIn the ablation study, three important components are suddenly mentioned, including data augmentation (DA), null-label weight hyperparameter (\u03b1), and hetero-ordered merging (HM). However, the previous METHODOLOGY chapter does not seem to emphasize the importance of the first two components.\nThe HyperRED dataset is the only existing dataset for extracting nary relations with annotated extracted entities. How can the generalization ability of the model be demonstrated?\nThe structure in INTRODUCTION is slightly confusing, such as whether the second paragraph can be considered in the following chapter, and then whether the third paragraph should appear in related work.\nSome of the content in the article is duplicated, resulting in the compression of the substantive content. For example, in RELATED WORK \"An n-ary relational knowledge graph (NKG) consists of n-ary relational facts, which contain n entities (n \u2265 2)...... because we cannot distinguish which binary relations are combined to represent the n-ary relational fact in the whole KG. \"is repeated in the INTRODUCTION, and some places can be pointed out briefly.\nThere are some minor errors in the grammar and format of the paper, such as \"course-grained\" should be \"coarse-grained\", and \"imput\" in \"where t = | X | is the imput token length\". In addition, it is best to add parentheses to the citations in the text, otherwise the content will look confusing and difficult to read."

Could you explain a bit more about the scalability of Text2NKG when dealing with large corpora of natural language text? How does the framework handle processing extensive datasets, and have you encountered any computational challenges in scaling up?\n\n5. In the context of relation extraction, have you considered potential biases in the natural language data that Text2NKG may encounter? How do you address or mitigate any biases that may be inadvertently learned by the model during the extraction process?\n\n6. In terms of the performance of fine grains, can more experimental results be provided to confirm?\n\n7. After span-tuple multi-label classification, how is the answer label-list for relations obtained in so many classifications?\n\n8.Is only one training item depicted in Figure 3? If so, it is best to explain it so as not to create the misunderstanding that the subject is to be fixed. Additionally, an explanation for the variable 'm' in SPAN-TUPLE MULTI-LABEL CLASSIFICATION can be provided.\n\n9.Why does the data augmentation strategy mentioned in TRAINING STRATEGY result in more accurate training after conducting swapping and inverse operations? What is the underlying mechanism?\n\n10. In the Eq. 2, what is the main reason to choose BERT? Can we use other models instead?"

                    "value": "The paper introduces a novel approach for extracting n-ary facts that go beyond the traditional triplet format <h, r, t>. In this n-ary setting, facts can encompass related entities (e.g., time, location, etc.) and their associated relationships within a single tuple. To extract such facts, the model begins by extracting a fundamental 3-ary fact. The input sentence is encoded by packed levitated markers [Ye et al. (2022)] followed by a BERT encoder. Following this, three separate linear transformations are applied to the entity encoding for relation decision. Subsequently, these 3-ary relational facts can potentially be merged to form higher-arity facts. Experimental results on the HyperRED dataset demonstrate the performance of the proposed model compared to two basic baselines and a dedicated model CubeRE. \n\nAlthough the problem of extracting n-ary facts is interesting, the paper's methodological contributions are somewhat limited, especially within the ICLR community. Furthermore, the quality of the representation provided in the paper is suboptimal, with some critical technical details left unclear. For example, the process of merging 3-ary facts into higher-order facts lacks clarity. As a result, I recommend rejecting this paper."

                    "value": "1. Technical novelty is limited. The model's approach is rather conventional, involving the extraction of 3-ary facts through existing methods and their subsequent merging to create higher-order models.\n2. The paper's representation of the methodology falls short. There are notable deficiencies in explaining crucial technical aspects. E.g., the process of merging 3-ary facts to form higher-order facts lacks clarity.\n3. The experimental evaluation is not sufficient. The study only utilizes a single dataset, HyperRED, and does not include comparisons with diverse datasets such as JF17K, FB-AUTO, and M-FB15K."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. The text in Figure 1 is too tiny to read. \n2. The problem definition part (on page 4) is not presented in a clear manner, which can lead to confusion among readers. For instance, there is a confusing use of \"R\" and \"\\matchcal R\" for different concepts. It's unclear what \"R()\" represents\u2014whether it's the output of n-ary relation extraction or part of the NKG schema.\n3. On page 5, when (A, B, C) represents a span-tuple, it's unclear what \"A^2_{m\u22121}\" signifies.\n4. It's not evident why Equation 3 is considered a multiple-label classification problem. It appears to resemble a conventional multi-class classification problem.\n5. Since the decoding relies on merging 3-ary tuples, it's unclear how the proposed model supports the other four schemas of n-ary facts, such as the event-based schema depicted in Figure 5."
