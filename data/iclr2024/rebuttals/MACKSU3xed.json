                    "value": "The paper introduces \"PeriodNet,\" a lightweight and efficient model tailored for multivariate time series prediction, placing emphasis on the extraction and importance of periodic features in time series data. While existing models in the domain have achieved remarkable outcomes, many are computationally intensive due to their reliance on intricate attention mechanisms or causal convolutions, making them unsuitable for situations with limited computational resources or edge devices.\n\nAddressing this challenge, the authors draw inspiration from Fourier series mathematics to design a novel module that efficiently extracts periodic features from time series data. Further, a unique module for the fusion of local and global features has been proposed, aiming to enhance feature representation and prediction accuracy.\n\nWhen tested against seven benchmark datasets, PeriodNet exhibited significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it's designed with fewer parameters and uses basic deep learning modules, making it a promising solution for resource-constrained application scenarios."

While the paper claims to introduce a \"lightweight and efficient\" model for MTS analysis, there's no comparative analysis on the number of parameters in the experiments, nor is there a dedicated analysis discussing its efficiency.\n  \n2. Several of the illustrations in the paper seem to lack informational value and relevance. For instance, Figure 3 unnecessarily dedicates significant space to illustrating the common knowledge concept of the Fourier transform. Figure 4, which describes basic matrix multiplication, and Figure 5, depicting the elementary concept of one-dimensional convolution, both seem unrelated to the core concepts of the paper.\n\n3. The mathematical notation used in the paper is subpar. Matrices should be represented in bold, and vectors and variables should be explained before being incorporated.\n\n4. The experimental section, represented by Figure 7, lacks proper interpretation. Additionally, the proposed method doesn't seem to have an edge over other comparative methods.\n\n5. The provided code link leads to an empty repository, making the replication of the proposed method impossible.\n   \nIn summary, the paper appears to be in a preliminary state with missing code and incomplete experiments."

Based on the findings that a straightforward linear model can effectively handle time series forecasting, the paper introduces a forecasting model that employs a decomposition of time series inputs into multiple components using Fourier modules. Additionally, the model incorporates an LTWG (Local Talks with Global) module for processing both local and global features of each component. Within this module, a linear model is responsible for capturing global features, while a CNN model handles the local features."

More detailed explanations\nThe paper falls short in providing sufficiently detailed explanations for some sections.

                "questions": {
                    "value": "**lacks of coherence in writing**\n1. The author's citation of [1] to argue the effect of a simple linear model against complex models like Transformers is not appropriate, as PatchTST in [1] is also based on Transformers. Therefore, [1] is not a suitable reference for this argument.\n\n2. In the introduction section, the author said that \"based on the above, we can\u2019t help but think which is more important in time-series prediction, trend or period?\". However, this question does not appear to be directly connected to the preceding discussion about the effectiveness of linear models against Transformers and TCN.\n\n3. The 'Related Work' section should be rewritten to make it more coherent with the main topic and the proposed method. It currently implies that the approach to decompose time series has shifted from artificially defined operators to learning-based methods in the deep learning era, but the proposed method still uses artificially defined operators, such as average pooling.\n\n**More detailed explanations**\n1. The author insisted that the results of time series forecasting are more determined by periods, but the argument lacks supporting evidence. Time series can be decomposed into several parts such as seasonal and trend-cyclical parts in [2]. In other words, periods are not the only component in time series. Thus, more supporting evidence is necessary for this argument. Also, the argument that a trend is a period has to be supported by some intuitive evidence. This is because your belief is different from a common belief that a trend and period are different as in [2].\n\n2. Can you give some examples explaining why low-frequency and high-frequency periods are long-term and short-term trends?\n\n3. Transformers typically have quadratic computational costs due to self-attention structures. However, I think that the number of parameters in Transformers may not be excessively large because key, query, and value weight parameters can be reused for each token. The paper could benefit from explaining this point further.\n\n4. After the decomposition process, time series are decomposed into 4 components including noise. At this point, clarification is needed regarding why noise is used for prediction after the decomposition process. Noise can contain irrelevant information that may disrupt the forecasting process, so the paper should explain the rationale behind including and processing noise components.\n\n5. What does $X_{temp}$ denote in Eq. (1)? There is no definition of it.\n\n6. In general, the Fourier series is formulated as follows: $s(x) \\sim A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}(A_n cos(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{P}) + B_n cos(\\frac{2\\pi n x}{P}))$. In this formula, $x$ denotes time steps. However, $x$ in your Eq. (2) and (3) denotes observation values. Can you further elaborate on this difference?\n\n\n\n[1] Nie et al., A time series is worth 64 words: Long-term forecasting with transformers, 2023, ICLR  \n[2] Wang et al., MICN: MULTI-SCALE LOCAL AND GLOBAL CONTEXT MODELING FOR LONG-TERM SERIES FORECASTING, ICLR, 2023"

Two key components, Fourier module and LTWG (local talks with global) module are both straightforward. \n2.\tThe related work lacks the discussion of decomposition methods in time series. The decomposition (e.g., seasonal-trend decomposition) is studied widely in the literature of time series, e.g., the STL decomposition, STR decomposition, Robust STL decomposition, etc. \n3.\tExperiments: The ablation study is not complete. The authors only consider with and without Fourier module and LTWG module. It would be more convincing by providing more ablation studies when some modules of the decomposition is replaced by other modules."
