However such generalization was only tested on in-distribution settings. Also, the expensive time cost of incorporating a finite-difference solver is not addressed or discussed.\n\n3) Solidness: the authors claimed in the abstract that 'We include results of extensive experimentation, comparing our method to SOTA approaches...'. however, the PDEs in experiments are relatively simple, and the baselines are not strong, compared with [1].\n\n[1]Wu, Haixu, et al. \"Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models.\" (2023)."

For PDE solving, is the time cost of CONFINDE smaller than pure neural models such as FNO?\n\n2) The experiments are all about smooth solutions (Fig3 and Fig5). But in more practical settings, the PDE solution includes a discontinuity, also known as a 'shock wave' in Burgers and N-S. In such cases, the finite difference is more likely to fail or require more computations than in the smooth solution. Can you add some experiments on the shock wave data?\n\n3) Can you test the 'zero-shot' in the OOD setting, or at least in-distribution on a larger domain? For example,  change the Burgers parameter $a \\sim U[0,1]$ to $U[0,10]$.\n\n4) In the ablation study,  network size (number of learnable parameters) varies in different settings, which may affect the validity of the performance comparison."

                        "value": "Thank you for the helpful feedback. We are pleased to report that we added the suggested experiments to the new version of the paper.\n\n**Regarding weaknesses:**\n1. While we agree that estimating PDE coefficients from observations is not a new task, the task we aim to solve is quite different. In our scenario, each signal in the datasets (both train and test) are generated from different dynamics. This means that there are dynamics in the test set never seen before. Having different coefficients per signal makes our task much more challenging than other related works, which mainly focus on the scenario where the entire dataset is created from the same dynamics but with different initial conditions. \nThe novelty in our approach is that it is capable of creating reliable predictions even in this scenario, while also providing a specific estimation of the PDE coefficients for the given signal. This estimation holds high value in many scenarios as also discussed in many other papers in the area (for example papers [1] and [2].\n2. We agree that using a PDE-solver has an expensive time cost. However, the main goal of our paper is not to create a fast replacement to a solver (such as in neural-operator related works). Our algorithm\u2019s main goal is to utilize given mechanistic knowledge in order to estimate the coefficients for each signal. We then show at inference time how these coefficients could be used to provide reliable predictions.\n3. As we show throughout our experiments section, a relatively simple PDE is already a hard task when considering every signal in the dataset comes from a different context. This task gets even harder when the test set signals are generated from coefficients that were never seen in the train set.\nRegarding the benchmarks suggested in the paper you provided, all datasets are generated from using the same coefficients. For example, in the Navier-Stokes experiment, the viscosity coefficient is constant (10^-5), and in the Darcy-Flow experiment, the external force equals 1 for all signals.\n\n[1] Linial et. al. \"Generative ODE modeling with known unknowns\"\n[2] Yang et. al. \"Learning Physics Constrained Dynamics Using Autoencoders\"\n\n**Regarding questions:**\n\n1. For params estimation, our method provides a very fast alternative to the \u201cintegral\u201d approach used in the adjoint method. Adding a PINN loss does not improve the time cost of this method.\nTo demonstrate this, we added a new demonstration to the appendix (appendix E), where we demonstrate how CONFIDE works in comparison to an adjoint+PINN method.\nIn this experiment, we evaluate these methods on a pendulum equation (which is formulated as an ODE), and demonstrate that CONFIDE\u2019s results are not only better in terms of prediction and coefficient estimation, but also trains ~44 times faster.\n2. As requested, we added a new shockwave experiment based on the Burgers\u2019 equation in appendix C1.\nFor this experiment, we created a new test set of signals that have a discontinuity at t=0, and compared the algorithms on this data. We observed that CONFIDE still outperformed other baselines (as can be seen in table 3). We believe that the reason is that CONFIDE evaluates the derivatives at different patches of the observed context $u^c$ at each iteration, and most of them are smooth. \nNote that in this case, CONFIDE could be modified to handle discontinuity, by evaluating the spatial and temporal derivatives only on the parts in the signal that are smooth. For instance, if we observe that there is a discontinuity in the initial conditions of the signal, at x=x_0, then we can evaluate finite differences for x<x0, and x>x0 separately and enforce the PDE in these regions. For the sake of evaluation we did not add this modification to our algorithm in this\n3. As requested, we added a new OOD experiment based on the Burgers\u2019 equation in appendix C2.\nFor this experiment, we created a new test set, where in all signals the coefficient a is sampled from U[2,4] instead of U[1,2] as in the train set.\nNote that we did not re-train any of the algorithms, but used the ones trained on the a~U[1,2].\nAs can be seen in the results, CONFIDE still outperformed other baselines although it never observed coefficients as these.\nCONFIDE projects the observed signal to the range of coefficients in the train set, and finds the ones that best describes the observed signal.\n4. In the ablation study where we change the size of the context (the amount of time steps in each signal in the train set), the only change of size is in the first layer. The network size does change but not drastically:\nrho=0.05: #params = 4.7M,\nrho=0.2: #params = 5M, \nrho=0.5: #params = 5.6M.\nAs can be seen in figure 11, CONFIDE\u2019s results are almost not impaired even when the context size is very small, and the network size is a bit smaller as a result."

I raised my score to 5, but I still have the following unaddressed questions:\n\n1. w.r.t. Q1 and appendix E.  Sorry for my ambiguous expression \"...CONFINDE better than PINN and the classical adjoint method\". I mean both PINN and adjoint methods can solve inverse problems. PINN paper [1] Figure 4 shows that it can recover NS equation coefficients. Your newly added experiments show that CONFIDE is faster than the adjoint method or physics loss+adjoint method, but not the PINN.\n\n2. w.r.t. Q2 and appendix C.1.  You created a non-propagating artificial discontinuity in the initial condition and handled them \"by evaluating derivatives only on the smooth parts at t=0\". However, the usual shock wave is generated and propagated by the fluid itself ([wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave)). How to predict/solve discontinuities generated by the fluid itself at some future t>0? And how to deal with propagating discontinuities? I still think the finite difference, at least your forward-time central-space scheme, is not a suitable solver for practical PDE problems, which limits the significance of your work. \n\n\nRef:\n1.

It is true that PINN (and other neural solvers) have longer offline training time, but they generally have lower online inference time, compared with classical numerical schemes. In real applications, the inference speed is usually more critical. As for the drawback that the model \"is trained to fit only a single signal\" and \"has unbalanced two losses\", there are also some (non-SOTA) remedies [1,2]\n\n2. To my knowledge, the vanilla finite difference is not a reliable scheme for a simple 1D Euler's equation (the shock tube problem, the simplest benchmark of CFD solver), see the demonstration in Section 1.4 in [3].

Learning a PDE directly from data is a very different task than assuming it has a specific structure, such as the heat equation referenced here and just learning its coefficients. The description of the task is really the latter simpler task of learning the coefficients and is buried inside the introduction and is difficult to follow.\n- More examples are needed on why modeling using PDEs is limited. The (in)compressible Navier Stokes equations has been state-of-art in ocean dynamics and aerodynamics, respectively. I can see the motivation for not knowing the PDE parameter value exactly.\n- Numerical methods seem to be discounted and credited only for low-complexity problems but they are still state-of-the-art and have been made efficient with the last 40-50 years of high performance computing (HPC) research and numerical analysis. Good mention and analogy to RANs models though.\n- Too much description of the method in the introduction section that should be saved for the method section.\n- This two stage approach is reminiscent of CROM (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.02607.pdf), ICLR 2023, which uses neural representations to represent the spatial part of the PDE and then solves the resulting semi-discrete ODE forward in time using time stepping method.\n- The choice of finite difference methods over finite volume (suited for hyperbolic conservation laws) and finite element methods for unstructured meshes.\n- The background on current state-of-the-art SciML methods is extremely limited in the second paragraph of the related work section. In particular, Brandstetter et al., 2022 and Li et al., 2020 are very different methods, where the former is message-passing GNN based and the later is a Neural Operator approach. An advantage of Neural Operators, which is not discussed here is that they can learn the mapping from PDE parameters to solutions (Subramanian et. al, \"Towards Foundation Models for Scientific Machine Learning: Characterizing Scaling and Transfer Behavior\", NeurIPS 2023 and Negiar et. al, \"Learning differentiable solvers for systems with hard constraints\", ICLR 2023).\n- Reference to MeshGraphNets (Pfaff et. al, ICLR 2021) is missing which is another state-of-the-art class of GNN models for PDEs.\n- PINNs (Raissi et. al) can be used to solve inverse problems.\n- The authors should not be discussing details of their method in related work before describing their method in detail.\n- Assuming the form of the PDE is still a strong assumption.\n- Since the authors are comparing to a variant of NeuralODE, they should compare to DINO (\"Continuous PDE Dynamics Forecasting with Implicit Neural Representations\", ICLR 2023), which is designed for PDEs instead of ODEs for NeuralODEs and uses neural representation for the spatial discretization and then NeuralODEs to advance the continuous ODE forward in time.\n- The authors note that they cannot use PDEBench in the experiments since it is generated from the sample context. For other benchmarking examples see the GPME benchmarking framework in Hansen et. al, \"Learning Physical Models that can respect conservation laws\", ICML 2023 and various challenging PDEs including Navier-Stokes in Saad et. al, \"Guiding continuous operator learning through Physics-based boundary conditions\", ICLR 2023.\n- Large limitation to only test on (quasi)-linear and not concern challenging nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs is where numerical methods actually have challenges, e.g., hyperbolic conservation laws (nonlinear PDEs) and Stefan in Hansen et. al\n- The x vs t heat maps are more difficult to visualize in Figure 3 than the solution over space plotted at particular times as done in numerical methods. Also these plots are too qualitative to visual the performance improvement and plots of the errors would be better. Also it may be better to move these solution profiles to an appendix. Similarly for Figure 5.\n- Burgers' should be labeled properly as quasi-linear\n- The authors mention their motivation is for more explainable solution to PDEs and handle extrapolation. I don't see how either of these objectives are met by the method or shown in the experiments. The abstract should be rewritten to clarify this.\n\nMinor\n- Put RANs in parenthesis\n- Takamoto reference for PDEBench should be in parenthesis and similar for other citations"

                    "value": "1. How does learning the PDE parameters couple with and affect the accuracy of the numerical solver?\n2. The numerical solver is a critical component and several solvers are better for different PDEs. Why was PyPDE chosen and which numerical schemes is it using?\n3. Why are finite difference methods used over finite volume and finite element methods? The choice of numerical method may vary for the different class of PDEs. Also, I don't understand why using finite differences eliminates the need to explicitly state the boundary conditions.\n4. Why is an autoencoder architecture selected? Were there ablation studies to motivate this choice?\n5. Based on the notation in Eqn. (1), does the method only work on linear PDEs? For instance, I see nonlinear Burgers $u_t + uu_x = 0 \\iff u_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial u^2}{\\partial x} = 0$ in the experiments but I don't see how this equation fits in the form of Eq (1). I later found in Section 4.2 that it is only quasi-linear Burgers that is concerned so I think the p in Eqn. (1) could not be constant and need to depend on $u$ even in this case.\n6. Why is FNO and U-Net beating the proposed method CONFIDE in Figure 2a at early time steps? \n7. Why is FNO performing so poorly on the Fitz-Hugh-Nagumo equations? This seems odd.\n8. Since CONFIDE is not an operator, is it resolution invariant like Neural Operator methods are?\n9. Is the extrapolation task tested in the experiments?\n10. How is CONFIDE an \"explainable\" method?"

                        "value": "Thank you for the attentive and informative feedback.\n\n**Regarding Weaknesses:**\n\nAs per requested, we have added some modifications to the text (marked with red), and changed figure 3 to display the solution at particular time points.\n\n**Regarding questions:**\n\n1. The process of learning the PDE parameters does not depend on the numerical solver at all. During the training phase, our model consumes the observed signal and outputs an estimation for the coefficients. These coefficients are then optimized to best fit the PDE alongside the derivatives which are numerically computed. It is only in the inference phase where we might use a numerical solver in order to provide predictions to a given signal.\n2. The main goal of our paper is not to create a new efficient PDE solver (such as in neural-operator related works), but to utilize given mechanistic knowledge in order to estimate the coefficients of the PDE (which are different for each signal). We then demonstrate how one can use the estimated coefficients to create reliable predictions, even using a rather simple solver such as PyPDE (specifically the explicit solver).\nOur training scheme does not use any solver, but directly infers the PDE coefficients.\n3. We use finite-differences method only to obtain numerical derivatives which can be substituted into the PDE. Using other methods, as you mentioned, is completely valid as long as the derivatives can be calculated. The choice of finite-differences in our case, was enough to result in reliable and fast estimation of the coefficients. However, a user can change this easily and plug-in any choice of derivatives calculations.\nRegarding boundary-conditions: when using finite differences to compute the derivatives, we do not use the boundary condition (we only need them when attempting to solve the PDE). Therefore, estimating the coefficients does not depend on boundary-conditions. However, during inference time, when a user wants to use the estimated coefficients to solve the PDE, one would need to determine what boundary conditions are needed.\n4. We address this question in ablation appendix C.3 (figure 10) (which in the new version became D3, and figure 12), where we compare between an architecture without a decoder part, one with a decoder part and one with a decoder part which is also \u201cinitial-conditions aware\u201d.\n5. We are sorry for the confusion. The coefficients in equation (1) are not necessarily constants, but could be functions. In the Burgers\u2019 experiment, the coefficient b is a function of u, and in the FN2D experiment, the coefficients which are the local reaction terms depend on both solution signals u and v.\n6. Our method learns a mapping between the observed signal and the coefficients. Estimating the coefficients correctly results in good long-horizon prediction as shown in the figure (and as usually desired). FNO and UNET train to predict one-step into the future, and then auto-regressively iterate to produce the next predictions. This is why these methods tend to do well in the very near future predictions, while CONFIDE tends to be more robust and reliable.\n7. As can be seen in Figure 6, FNO behaves very similarly to UNET through most of the prediction time until at some point it diverges from the true solution. The prediction figures we added should help to understand how each algorithm scored at each time point.\n8. CONFIDE could be used as long as numerical derivatives can be computed (e.g., by finite-differences). This notion does not change when resolution changes, therefore there is no limit to using CONFIDE on different resolutions.\n9. We stress that each signal in our test set is generated not only from different initial conditions, but also from coefficients not seen in the train set. As can be seen in our experiments section, this task alone is already a hard task, as modern baselines struggle to generate reliable predictions.\n10. We note that the term \u201cexplainable\u201d here is not the same as standard \u201cexplainable-ML\u201d methods.\nOur meaning was that since CONFIDE provides coefficient-estimation to a given signal, it provides the user some knowledge (or explanation) regarding the observed signal. For example, In the electric vehicle batteries case ( last paragraph of the introduction), the coefficients hold valuable information regarding the battery\u2019s capacity, how old it is, how fast it could discharge and so on. In healthcare for instance, there has been a great effort in designing a differential system of the cardio-vascular system, and inferring the parameter of cardiac contractility, or the parameter of arterial resistance, holds great value for clinicians as they decide on their treatments."
