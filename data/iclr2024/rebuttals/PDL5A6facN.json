                    "value": "This paper presents a novel RL algorithm based on Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) to improve the convergence rate. Specifically, the authors adapt the NAG into policy gradient to develop APG and mathematically show the global convergence rate of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/t^2)$, which is faster than the existing $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$., with the true gradient and softmax policy parameterization. The authors also show that regardless of initialization, APG is able to reach a locally nearly-concave regime, within finite iterations. To validate the theory, the authors use two simple benchmarks to demonstrate that APG outperforms the standard PG."

Some assumptions to characterize the analysis are strong and not justified well. Why is Assumption 1 required to guarantee the convergence? Please justify in the paper. Otherwise, it might be a strong condition in the work. How likely is the assumption satisfied in the various real-world scenarios? What is the point to have Assumption 2? Not a more generic range [-R, R] in many existing works? Why is Assumption 4 is required for the convergence? I understand it could be attained in practice.\n\n3. In Theorem 1, the authors mentioned that the softmax parameterized policy is tabular. What does it mean by tabular here? Would it mean the policy acts like a lookup table? Do the conclusions still apply if removing tabular? It is confusing in the paper.\n\n4. The experimental results are not promising. The benchmark models are quite simple. The authors should present more complex benchmark models. Continuous environment should be utilized to showcase APG's superiority. \n\n5. Definitions 1 and 2 are a bit ah-hoc for the convergence proof in this work. If they are existing, the authors should cite references. Otherwise, the author should justify why they are needed.\n\n6. Section 6.2 did not really present anything new on the lower bound. How to relate Theorem 3 to APG? The authors only said due to Theorem 3, there was no tighter lower bound for APG. This seems to me quite simple. They should show the contradiction if there existed a tighter lower bound for APG.\n\nI think the paper still requires a substantial amount of work to make it technically solid and sound."

                        "value": "**We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments and helpful suggestions.**\n\n### **Q. Highlight the novelty of this work.**\nWe would like to highlight the novelty and the contributions of this paper as follows:\n\n- One major contribution is the first global convergence rate of Nesterov acceleration in the context of RL. Despite the fact that APG is built on the classic Nesterov momentum and is not a completely new algorithm, it is rather remarkable that this method still achieves a convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ under the complex, non-concave RL objective (The non-concavity has been demonstrated in [Mei et al., 2020]). Notably, addressing non-concavity poses challenges in establishing global convergence and convergence rates under Nesterov acceleration (compared to [Ghadimi et al., 2017; Carmon el at., 2018] that have only achieved convergence to a stationary point). Despite this, this paper successfully establishes such a rate.\n\n- Notably, in the constant step-size regime (which is one of the most widely adopted setting in practice), we establish that APG indeed achieves a superior global convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$, which is better than the $O(1/t)$ rate of vanilla PG and the $O(1/t)$ rate of NPG under constant step sizes.\n\n- Additionally, we would like to underscore the significance of the local near-concavity property (cf. Lemma 1), a novel and important finding that is not present in the existing literature. Over the decades, despite the adaptation of various acceleration methods to RL, the non-concavity of the RL objective has deterred comprehensive analyses of the underlying convergence behavior. This lemma unveils the local near-concavity of the complex RL objective, and this important structural property could naturally spark future analysis in more RL settings (e.g., stochastic settings or under function approximation).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Q. Clarification on the assumptions**\nWe would like to clarify the general applicability of Assumptions 1, 2, and 4 mentioned by the reviewer. \n\n- To begin with, Assumption 1, which requires the strict positivity of the surrogate initial state distribution $\\mu$, is a standard assumption adopted in the existing RL literature on the global convergence of policy gradient methods [Agarwal et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2021 Xiao, 2022]. Moreover, we would like to emphasize that the surrogate initial distribution $\\mu$, which is different from the true initial distribution $\\rho$, is a parameter that could be freely chosen by the RL algorithm. With the help of the surrogate distribution $\\mu$, the policy gradient methods (e.g., PG and APG) could work without the knowledge about the true distribution $\\rho$, as also indicated and adopted by the existing works (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Xiao, 2022])\n\n\n- Regarding Assumption 2, specifying the range of the reward serves to simplify the pre-constant in the convergence rate. For instance, assuming the reward range to be $[-R, R]$ introduces a factor of $2|R|$ in the pre-constant. It is noteworthy that altering the reward range can be interpreted as applying a linear transformation from the original $[0, 1]$ range and hence preserve the fundamental properties of the MDP environment (e.g., an optimal policy remains optimal after such transformation) and the associated lemma/theorem. Therefore, Assumption 2 could be adopted without any loss of generality. This assumption, common in the RL literature, aligns with the standard assumptions used in the existing works on the convergence of policy gradient methods (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2022; Xiao, 2022]).\n\n- Regarding Assumption 4, it can be easily met in practice (as acknowledged by the reviewer) and is employed only to ensure the existence of the limiting value vector $V^{\\pi^{(t)}}$ under APG. Based on the existence of the limiting $V^{\\pi^{(t)}}$, we proceed to establish the asymptotic global convergence of APG, which is a highly non-trivial result due to the momentum (cf. Appendix C) and an important building block of the convergence rate analysis, by considering the actions with positive, negative, and zero advantage value in the limit. The detailed usage of Assumption 4 is discussed in Lemma 15 (page 24)."

                        "value": "### **Q. The softmax tabular parameterization.**\nThe softmax tabular parameterization, extensively used and discussed in the RL literature (e.g., [Szepesv\u00e1ri et al., 2022]), serves as a method to express a policy in a well-defined tabular format (and hence we follow the convention by using the term \"tabular\"). This representation involves storing and manipulating the policy explicitly in a table, where each row is associated with a state, and each column is associated with each possible action.\n\nMoreover, it is important to note that tabular parameterization is a commonly used scheme in the convergence rate analysis of policy gradient methods (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Xiao 2022].\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Q. Empirical performance of APG in more complex benchmark environments**\nTo begin with, we would like to first highlight that the main focus of this paper is the theoretical convergence rate of APG, and the experimental results in small-scale MDPs in Figures 1-2 are included mainly to validate the $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ convergence rate. \n\nOn the other hand, as suggested by the reviewer, we further evaluate the performance of APG beyond the true gradient setting in more diverse RL environments. Specifically, we extend APG to the stochastic setting (please see Algorithm 7 in Appendix H for the pseudo code) and test the stochastic APG in LunarLander-v2 and BipedalWalker-v3 using the estimated gradients. The detailed experimental results and the learning curves can be found in Appendix H in the revised manuscript. At a glance, the following table highlights that APG consistently outperforms HBPG and PG in terms of convergence behavior in both LunarLander-v2 and BipedalWalker-v3. These results showcase the empirical superiority of the APG method.\n\n| Total Environment Interactions / Algorithms | LunarLander-v2 (1.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (2.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (4e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (6e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (1.2e7 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (2e7 steps) |\n|---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------------:|------------------------------|\n|           **APG (mean / std dev)**          |    **59.41709 / 28.38159**   |   **177.36543 / 82.97050**   |   **235.86339 / 3.75312**  |   **115.29717 / 51.89256**   |    **254.83298 / 19.24260**    |   **249.83565 / 28.13334**   |\n|            HBPG (mean / std dev)            |      27.76393 / 20.25072     |     180.82551 / 56.37636     |    151.22692 / 83.93418    |      55.92438 / 113.5947     |      216.47174 / 70.40871      |     232.24193 / 59.57783     |\n|             PG (mean / std dev)             |     -144.25341 / 25.66134    |     -128.69148 / 13.92372    |    -107.66071 / 3.56015    |      1.47716 / 23.27089      |      191.22486 / 20.54212      |     249.27057 / 12.74333     |\n\n**(The results reported above are the averaged over 3 random seeds.)**"

Here, we highlight the motivation for introducing Definitions 1 and 2, underscoring the innovative nature of Definition 1. In comparing our $C$-near concavity with traditional concavity, we accentuate that $C$-near concavity entails less stringent conditions than classic concavity. The differentiation emerges due to the inclusion of the tolerance constant $C$ in our definition of concavity. This signifies that there exists a $C$ times larger tolerance than the original concavity, rendering $C$-near concavity a more flexible and adaptable concept. For a more detailed discussion, please refer to our paper, particularly on page 7, where we have provided additional explanations on these definitions.\n\nRegarding Definition 2, this definition is to characterize a set of directions that are effective in enhancing policy performance under APG. Specifically, this definition is meant to characterize the update directions that maximize the increase in the probability of the optimal action. Under this definition, we show that the RL objective is $C$-nearly concave in these directions.\n\nIn summary, both Definitions 1 and 2 constitute novel contributions in our work. Beyond their effectiveness in our specific settings and proofs, Definition 1 introduces a less stringent property for the  RL objective function, paving the way for further research. Moreover, Definition 2 serves as a characterization of update directions for policy improvement under APG.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Q. Elucidating the motivation for introducing Section 6.2**\nSection 6.2 aims to underscore the absence of contradiction with the lower bound established in [Mei et al., 2020]. This is attributed to APG's ability to traverse a larger region of the domain than what PG can reach, elucidating why no contradiction exists.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **References**\n- [Mei et al., 2020] Jincheng Mei, Chenjun Xiao, Csaba Szepesvari, and Dale Schuurmans, \u201cOn the Global Convergence Rates of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d ICML 2020.\n- [Agarwal et al., 2020] Alekh Agarwal, Sham M Kakade, Jason D Lee, and Gaurav Mahajan, \u201cOn the Theory of Policy Gradient Methods: Optimality, Approximation, and Distribution Shift,\u201d COLT 2020.\n- [Ghadimi et al., 2017] Saeed Ghadimi and Guanghui Lan. \u201cAccelerated gradient methods for nonconvex nonlinear and stochastic programming,\u201d Mathematical Programming 2016.\n- [Carmon el at., 2018] Yair Carmon, John C Duchi, Oliver Hinder, and Aaron Sidford. \u201cAccelerated methods for nonconvex optimization,\u201d SIAM Journal on Optimization 2018.\n- [Szepesv\u00e1ri et al., 2022] Csaba Szepesv\u00e1ri, \u201cAlgorithms for reinforcement learning,\u201d Springer Nature 2022.\n- [Xiao, 2022] Lin Xiao, \u201cOn the Convergence Rates of Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d JMLR 2022.\n- [Ding et al., 2020] Ding, Dongsheng, et al. \u201cNatural policy gradient primal-dual method for constrained markov decision processes,\u201d NeurIPS 2020.\n- [Ding et al., 2022] Ding, Yuhao, Junzi Zhang, and Javad Lavaei. \u201cOn the global optimum convergence of momentum-based policy gradient,\u201d International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.

The work [1] has shown that a linear convergence rate, which is faster than $O(1/t^2)$, can be achieved by the policy gradient with an exponentially increasing step size. Moreover, the result in [1] is also based on the non-regularized MDP, which is the same setting as in this submission. The authors need to provide a detailed comparison of the theoretical results in [1] and this submission and also discuss the significance of the result in this submission, given the linear convergence rate in [1].  \n\n\n(2) Additionally, since this work discusses the lower bound of policy gradient, it is interesting to show why the linear convergence rate in [1] does not conflict with the lower bound provided in this submission.\n\n\n(3) The upper bound in this paper has a dependence on the factor $||\\frac{1}{\\mu}||\\_\\infty$.

                        "value": "**We thank the reviewer for the detailed comments and helpful suggestions.**\n\n### **Q. A detailed comparison between APG and the results in [Xiao, 2022]**\nWe thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestion on offering a comparison between our work and [Xiao, 2022]. Notably, one major difference lies in the algorithm used for acceleration: [Xiao, 2022] focuses on the policy mirror descent methods, which include natural policy gradient (NPG) as a special case (under direct tabular parameterization), while we focus on Nesterov accelerated gradient for RL (under softmax parameterization), which is a momentum-based approach. Accordingly, we provide a detailed comparison of these two family of approaches:\n\n**(1) Momentum:**\n\n**Empirical Aspect:** In practice, momentum is one of the most commonly used approaches for acceleration in policy optimization for RL, mainly due to its simplicity. Specifically, a variety of classic momentum methods (e.g., Nesterov momentum, heavy-ball method, and AdaGrad) have been already implemented in optimization solvers and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) as a basic machinery and shown to improve the empirical convergence results than the standard policy gradient methods like A2C and PPO (e.g., see [Henderson et al., 2018]).\n\n**Theoretical Aspect:** However, despite the popularity of these approaches in empirical RL, it has remained largely unknown whether momentum could indeed improve the theoretical global convergence rates of RL algorithms. To address this fundamental question, we establish the very first global convergence rate of Nesterov momentum in RL (termed APG in our paper) and show that APG could improve the rate of PG from $O(1/t)$ to $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ (in the constant step-size regime). Given the wide application of momentum, our analytical framework and the insights from our convergence result (e.g., local near-concavity) serve as an important first step towards better understanding the momentum approach in RL.\n\n**Theoretical Advantage:** In addition, we would like to highlight that in the constant step-size regime (which is one of the most widely adopted setting in practice), our proposed APG indeed achieves a superior global convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$, which is better than the $O(1/t)$ rate of vanilla PG and the $O(1/t)$ rate of NPG under constant step sizes.\n\n**(2) Natural Gradients (or more generally, Policy Mirror Descent):**\nTheoretical Aspect: Natural policy gradient (NPG), another RL acceleration technique, borrows the idea from the natural gradient, which uses the inverse of Fisher information matrix as the preconditioner of the gradient and can be viewed as achieving approximate steepest descent in the distribution space [Amari, 1998; Kakade, 2001]. Moreover, under direct policy parameterization, NPG is also known as a special case of policy mirror descent (PMD) with KL divergence as the proximal term [Shani et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2022]. Regarding the global convergence rates, NPG has been shown to achieve:\n(i) $O(1/t)$ rate under constant step sizes [Agarwal et al., 2020; Xiao, 2022] \n(ii) linear convergence either under adaptively increasing step sizes [Khodadadian et al., 2021] or non-adaptive geometrically increasing step sizes [Xiao, 2022]. \nNotably, under direct policy parameterization and geometrically increasing step sizes, similar linear convergence results can also be established for the more general PMD method [Xiao, 2022].\n\n**Empirical Issues:**\nDespite the above convergence rates, as also pointed out by [Mei et al., 2021a], it is known that NPG in general requires solving a costly optimization problem in each iteration (cf. [Kakade, 2001; Agarwal et al., 2020]) even with the help of compatible approximation theorem [Kakade, 2001] (unless the policy parametrization adopts some special forms, e.g., log-linear policies [Yuan et al., 2023]). Notably, the TRPO algorithm, a variant of NPG, is known to suffer from this additional computational overhead. Similarly, the PMD in general also requires solving a constrained optimization problem in each policy update [Xiao, 2022]. This computational complexity could be a critical factor for RL in practice.\n\n**(We further add a new section in Appendix I for a detailed comparison of the acceleration methods in RL.)**"

The $O(1/t)$ lower bound for policy gradient, as demonstrated in [Mei et al., 2020], is rooted in the softmax parameterization and the vanilla policy gradient approach, whereas the linear convergence rate in [Xiao, 2022] is based on direct parameterization and policy mirror descent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **Q.

Specifically, in Equation (60) of the original manuscript, we opt for simplicity by directly taking 1 as an upper bound of $d_{\\rho}^{\\pi_*}$, resulting in an ostensibly looser bound $\\lVert\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\rVert_\\infty$, albeit with a more lucid expression. Accordingly, we have updated the paper to incorporate the tighter bound with the term $\\lVert\\frac{d_{\\rho}^{\\pi_*}}{\\mu}\\rVert_\\infty$ in Lemma 11 on page 18, Theorem 2 on pages 7 & 35, and Theorem 7 on pages 45 & 46.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **References**\n- [Mei et al., 2020] Jincheng Mei, Chenjun Xiao, Csaba Szepesvari, and Dale Schuurmans, \u201cOn the Global Convergence Rates of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d ICML 2020.\n- [Xiao, 2022] Lin Xiao, \u201cOn the Convergence Rates of Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d JMLR 2022."

Specifically, a variety of classic momentum methods (e.g., Nesterov momentum, heavy-ball method, and AdaGrad) have been already implemented in optimization solvers and deep learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) as a basic machinery and shown to improve the empirical convergence results than the standard policy gradient methods like A2C and PPO (e.g., see [Henderson et al., 2018]). \n\n**Theoretical Aspect:** However, despite the popularity of these approaches in empirical RL, it has remained largely unknown whether momentum could indeed improve the theoretical global convergence rates of RL algorithms. To address this fundamental question, we establish the very first global convergence rate of Nesterov momentum in RL (termed APG in our paper) and show that APG could improve the rate of PG from $O(1/t)$ to $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ (in the constant step-size regime). Given the wide application of momentum, our analytical framework and the insights from our convergence result (e.g., local near-concavity) serve as an important first step towards better understanding the momentum approach in RL.\n\n**Theoretical Advantage:** In addition, we would like to highlight that in the unregularized constant step-size regime of  (which is one of the most widely adopted setting in practice), our proposed APG indeed achieves a superior global convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$, which is better than the $O(1/t)$ rate of vanilla PG and the $O(1/t)$ rate of NPG under constant step sizes.\n\n**(2) Regularization:**\n\n**Theoretical Aspect:** In the convex optimization literature, it is known that adding a strongly convex regularizer achieves acceleration by changing the optimization landscape. In the context of RL, despite the non-concave objective, regularization has also been shown to achieve faster convergence, such as the log-barrier regularization with $O(1/\\sqrt{t})$ rate [Agarwal et al., 2020] and the entropy regularization (i.e., adding a policy entropy bonus to the reward) with linear convergence rate $O(e^{-ct})$ [Mei et al., 2020], both in the exact gradient setting with constant step sizes. \n\nDespite the above convergence results, one common attack on regularization approaches is that they essentially change the objective function to that of regularized MDPs and hence do not directly address the original objective in unregularized RL, as pointed out by [Xiao, 2022; Mei et al., 2021a]."

Comparison of the acceleration methods for policy gradient in RL (continued)**\n\n**(3) Natural Gradients (or more generally, Policy Mirror Descent):**\n\n**Theoretical Aspect:** Natural policy gradient (NPG), another RL acceleration technique, borrows the idea from the natural gradient, which uses the inverse of Fisher information matrix as the preconditioner of the gradient and can be viewed as achieving approximate steepest descent in the distribution space [Amari, 1998; Kakade, 2001]. Moreover, under direct policy parameterization, NPG is also known as a special case of policy mirror descent (PMD) with KL divergence as the proximal term [Shani et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2022]. Regarding the global convergence rates, NPG has been shown to achieve:\n\n(i) $O(1/t)$ rate under constant step sizes [Agarwal et al., 2020; Xiao, 2022];\n\n(ii) linear convergence either under adaptively increasing step sizes [Khodadadian et al., 2021] or non-adaptive geometrically increasing step sizes [Xiao, 2022]. \nNotably, under direct policy parameterization and geometrically increasing step sizes, similar linear convergence results can also be established for the more general PMD method [Xiao, 2022].\n\n**Empirical Issues:**\nDespite the above convergence rates, as also pointed out by [Mei et al., 2021a], it is known that NPG in general requires solving a costly optimization problem in each iteration (cf. [Kakade, 2001; Agarwal et al., 2020]) even with the help of compatible approximation theorem [Kakade, 2001] (unless the policy parametrization adopts some special forms, e.g., log-linear policies [Yuan et al., 2023]). Notably, the TRPO algorithm, a variant of NPG, is known to suffer from this additional computational overhead. Similarly, the PMD in general also requires solving a constrained optimization problem in each policy update [Xiao, 2022]. This computational complexity could be a critical factor for RL in practice. \n\n**(4) Normalization:**\n\n**Theoretical Aspect:** In the exact gradient setting, the normalization approach, which exploits the non-uniform smoothness by normalizing the true policy gradient by its L2 gradient norm, has also been shown to achieve acceleration in RL. Specifically, the geometry-aware normalized (GNPG) has been shown to exhibit linear convergence rate under softmax policies [Mei et al., 2021a]. This rate could be largely attributed to the effective increasing step size induced by the normalization technique. \n\n**Empirical Issues:** Despite the linear convergence property, it has been already shown that GNPG could suffer from divergence in the standard on-policy stochastic setting, even in simple 1-state MDPs. This phenomenon is mainly due to the committal behavior induced by the increasing effective step size. This behavior could substantially hinder the use of GNPG in practice.\n\n**We have also included the above detailed comparison in the updated manuscript (cf. Appendix I).**"

                        "value": "### **Q. Generalizing the APG method to stochastic settings, where the policy gradient has to be estimated from samples?**\n\n**Algorithmic Aspect:** In the stochastic setting, we can extend APG (called Stochastic APG, or SAPG) by following a procedure similar to the classic stochastic policy gradient method by sampling a batch of data at each iteration (cf. Algorithm 7 in Appendix H in the updated manuscript). Subsequently, we estimate the stochastic gradients based on this batch and proceed to update our policy parameters. As for momentum, we directly update by incorporating the direction calculated as the difference between the current parameters and the previous parameters, scaled by the momentum step size. The above design resembles the typical Nesterov acceleration in the stochastic optimization literature [Ghadimi and Lan, 2016].\n\n**Empirical Aspect:** We conduct additional experiments to evaluate the Stochastic APG on two types of environments:\n\n(i) A 5-state, 5-action Markov Decision Process (MDP): In this part, we would like to have a glance at whether the improved convergence rate of APG over PG could be preserved in the stochastic setting. Please refer to Figure 4 in Appendix H.1 in our updated paper for the learning curves. The results show that in this example, stochastic PG has a rate of about $O(1/t)$ and SAPG exhibits a rate faster than $O(1/t)$. This shows the good potential of APG in the stochastic setting. \n\n(ii) More complex benchmark environments, including LunarLander-v2 and Bipedal Walker: \nIn this part, we compare SAPG with the stochastic PG and the stochastic Heavy Ball Policy Gradient (HBPG). As shown in the table below, we can see that SAPG still exhibits faster convergence over PG in both LunarLander and BipedalWalker. Furthermore, SAPG also enjoys better stability than HBPG in LunarLander. Please refer to Appendix H in our updated paper for the full learning curves.\n\n| Total Environment Interactions / Algorithms | LunarLander-v2 (1.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (2.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (4e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (6e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (1.2e7 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (2e7 steps) |\n|---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------------:|------------------------------|\n|           **APG (mean / std dev)**          |    **59.41709 / 28.38159**   |   **177.36543 / 82.97050**   |   **235.86339 / 3.75312**  |   **115.29717 / 51.89256**   |    **254.83298 / 19.24260**    |   **249.83565 / 28.13334**   |\n|            HBPG (mean / std dev)            |      27.76393 / 20.25072     |     180.82551 / 56.37636     |    151.22692 / 83.93418    |      55.92438 / 113.5947     |      216.47174 / 70.40871      |     232.24193 / 59.57783     |\n|             PG (mean / std dev)             |     -144.25341 / 25.66134    |     -128.69148 / 13.92372    |    -107.66071 / 3.56015    |      1.47716 / 23.27089      |      191.22486 / 20.54212      |     249.27057 / 12.74333     |\n\n**(The results reported above are the averaged over 3 random seeds.)**\n\n**Theoretical Aspect:**\nTo extend the convergence analysis of APG to the stochastic setting, we expect to build on the novel local near-concavity property and borrow ideas from the stochastic Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient  literature (e.g., [Ghadimi and Lan, 2016]). Specifically, we need to establish the following two results in the stochastic setting: (i) We need to demonstrate that SAPG will reach the nearly locally concave region within a finite number of time steps with high probability, regardless of the initialization. (ii) We also need to relax the convergence result of stochastic NAG typically for concave functions to that with only near concavity."

Clarification on the assumptions**\nWe would like to emphasize the general applicability of Assumptions 1 and 4. \n\n- To begin with, Assumption 1, which requires the strict positivity of the surrogate initial state distribution, is a standard assumption adopted in the existing RL literature on the global convergence of policy gradient methods [Agarwal et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2021 Xiao, 2022]. Moreover, we would like to highlight that the surrogate initial distribution $\\mu$, which is different from the true initial distribution $\\rho$, is a parameter that could be freely chosen by the RL algorithm. With the help of the surrogate distribution $\\mu$, the policy gradient methods (e.g., PG and APG) could work without the knowledge about the true distribution $\\rho$, as also indicated and adopted by the existing works (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Xiao, 2022])\n\n- Regarding Assumption 4, we would like to emphasize two important facts: \n\n   (i) The surrogate initial distribution $\\mu$, which is different from the true initial distribution $\\rho$, is a parameter that could be chosen by the RL algorithm. Notably, with the help of the surrogate distribution $\\mu$, the policy gradient methods (e.g., PG and APG) could work without the knowledge about the true distribution $\\rho$, as also indicated and adopted by the existing works (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Xiao, 2022]).\n\n   (ii) As mentioned in Remark 2 of our paper, Assumption 4 is a fairly mild requirement and can be met with probability one by choosing a surrogate initial distribution $\\mu$ uniformly at random from the unit simplex in practice, as also acknowledged by Reviewer y1oq.\n\n&nbsp;"

                        "value": "### **Q. Convergence analysis in the true gradient setting**\nTo begin with, we would like to highlight that the true gradient setting is widely employed as the first step of convergence rate analysis in RL, as supported by [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2021; Xiao, 2022]. Moreover, the structural properties obtained from the true gradient setting could subsequently inspire the convergence analysis for the more realistic stochastic settings. For example, the gradient dominance property (i.e., Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition) of PG was first discovered in the true gradient setting (e.g., [Agarwal et al., 2020; Mei et al., 2020]) and subsequently facilitates the convergence analysis of PG in the stochastic setting (e.g. [Yuan et al., 2022]).\nIn our work, our convergence analysis of APG unveils several important structural properties of Nesterov momentum in RL, such as the local near-concavity property, the absorbing behavior of this locally nearly-concave region, and the validity of using a surrogate optimal parameter with bounded norm. These useful properties, which are obtained through analysis under true gradients, could naturally inspire future analysis in the stochastic settings.\n\nAdditionally, to the best of our knowledge, even within the true gradient setting, our work represents the first attempt to characterize the global convergence rate of the Nesterov accelerated gradient in the context of RL. \n\nOn the other hand, as suggested by Reviewer y1oq, we further evaluate the performance of APG beyond the true gradient setting in more diverse RL environments. Specifically, we extend APG to the stochastic setting (please see Algorithm 7 in Appendix H for the pseudo code) and test the stochastic APG in LunarLander-v2 and BipedalWalker-v3 using the estimated gradients. The detailed experimental results and the learning curves can be found in Appendix H in the updated manuscript. At a glance, the following table highlights that APG consistently outperforms HBPG and PG in terms of convergence behavior in both LunarLander-v2 and BipedalWalker-v3.\n\n| Total Environment Interactions / Algorithms | LunarLander-v2 (1.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (2.5e6 steps) | LunarLander-v2 (4e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (6e6 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (1.2e7 steps) | BipedalWalker-v3 (2e7 steps) |\n|---------------------------------------------|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:------------------------------:|------------------------------|\n|           **APG (mean / std dev)**          |    **59.41709 / 28.38159**   |   **177.36543 / 82.97050**   |   **235.86339 / 3.75312**  |   **115.29717 / 51.89256**   |    **254.83298 / 19.24260**    |   **249.83565 / 28.13334**   |\n|            HBPG (mean / std dev)            |      27.76393 / 20.25072     |     180.82551 / 56.37636     |    151.22692 / 83.93418    |      55.92438 / 113.5947     |      216.47174 / 70.40871      |     232.24193 / 59.57783     |\n|             PG (mean / std dev)             |     -144.25341 / 25.66134    |     -128.69148 / 13.92372    |    -107.66071 / 3.56015    |      1.47716 / 23.27089      |      191.22486 / 20.54212      |     249.27057 / 12.74333     |\n\n**(The results reported above are the averaged over 3 random seeds.)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### **References**\n- [Mei et al., 2020] Jincheng Mei, Chenjun Xiao, Csaba Szepesvari, and Dale Schuurmans, \u201cOn the Global Convergence Rates of Softmax Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d ICML 2020.\n- [Agarwal et al., 2020] Alekh Agarwal, Sham M Kakade, Jason D Lee, and Gaurav Mahajan, \u201cOn the Theory of Policy Gradient Methods: Optimality, Approximation, and Distribution Shift,\u201d COLT 2020.\n- [Xiao, 2022] Lin Xiao, \u201cOn the Convergence Rates of Policy Gradient Methods,\u201d JMLR 2022.\n- [Ding et al., 2020] Ding, Dongsheng, et al. \"Natural policy gradient primal-dual method for constrained markov decision processes.\" NeurIPS 2020.\n- [Mei et al., 2021] Jincheng Mei, et al. \"Leveraging non-uniformity in first-order non-convex optimization,\" ICML 2021.\n- [Yuan et al., 2022] Rui Yuan, Robert M.

Assumptions and true gradient being used in previous works does not (directly) justify that they are not strong. It is natural to expect the assumptions to be lifted and the more vanilla setting of RL to be analyzed. Meanwhile I did appreciate the new techniques involved such as local near-concavity. It seems to be on a good track to incorporating Nestrove momentum into policy gradient."
