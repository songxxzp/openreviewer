Also, the paper presents a technique called Bias Neuron Suppression that aims to suppress the detected neurons that are responsible for the undesirable behavior, hence mitigating social biases in large language models. The paper performs an extensive evaluation comparing the approach to multiple baselines, demonstrating the merits of the proposed approach in mitigating social biases and being more fair."

The proposed approach is a significant step toward more interpretable Artificial Intelligence and aims to mitigate social biases without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning of very large language models like BERT or RoBERTa. The paper makes an extensive evaluation of the proposed approach and compares it with multiple baselines such as DPCE, AutoDebias, and Union_IG, demonstrating that the proposed approach outperforms them in terms of various bias metrics. Also, I really liked that the paper makes an extensive evaluation, including a large number of demographic attributes as well as modifiers. Overall, I believe that this is a good paper submission, and I believe it can advance research and state-of-the-art methods in mitigating social biases that arise from the use of large language models."

First, it will be good to clarify how you came up with the Demographic dimensions that are included in Table 1. Is this based on previous work or did you construct these dimensions for the purposes of this work? Also, for figure 2, the paper does not clarify what model is used to generate the results? Is this based on the BERT model? I suggest to the authors to clarify this and also discuss if they observe any differences in the presented results for Figure 2 across models. Finally, I would have liked to see a more detailed discussion and explanation of how the authors envision the use of the proposed approaches in other applications beyond social biases and debasing. The authors touch briefly upon this in the Introduction, however, they do not go into details, and it is unclear from a reader\u2019s perspective how the proposed approaches can be applied for other purposes."

We hope the following responses can clarify the missing points and address these concerns.\n\n**Q1: It will be good to clarify how you came up with the Demographic dimensions that are included in Table 1. Is this based on previous work or did you construct these dimensions for the purposes of this work?**\n\n**A1**:\nWe constructed the demographic dimension by concluding from previous works [1,2] in social bias research.\nMost previous research concentrated on the few prevalent demographic dimensions, such as gender or ethnicity. Besides, previous research mainly conducted their research on only one or two demographic dimensions. To be more comprehensive, we collect 9 demographic dimensions of concern in the current fairness research field from previous works.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n[1] Gender and Representation Bias in GPT-3 Generated Stories.\n\n[2] From Pretraining Data to Language Models to Downstream Tasks: Tracking the Trails of Political Biases Leading to Unfair NLP Models.\n\n**Q2: The paper does not clarify what model is used to generate the results for figure 2.**\n\n**A2**:\nThank you for your suggestion! The results are generated by FairBERTa. We have also reached similar conclusions for other models (BERT and RoBERTa). We have clarified this in our revised paper.\n\n**Q3: Would have liked to see a more detailed discussion and explanation of how the authors envision the use of the proposed approaches in other applications beyond social biases and debasing.**\n\n**A3**\nThank you so much for pointing this out! Our IG$^2$ can be applied to other research fields, e.g., comparative knowledge study. Previous works have found that models trained to learn comparative knowledge have better reasoning ability compared with those trained on singular knowledge. For example, models trained to learn that ''moon is round, not square'' can perform better in reasoning tasks than models trained to learn that ''moon is round''. Our IG$^2$ can be applied to detect neurons contributing to storing comparative knowledge and then amplify the activation of these neurons, in order to achieve better reasoning ability."

                    "value": "The paper introduces a new method, Integrated Gap Gradients (IG2), for measuring how much an individual neuron contributes to differences between logit predictions at the outputs. Combined with curated prompts that have positive or negative sentiment and are intended to be completed with a demographic group, this method is used to identify neurons in the network that most strongly contribute to differences between demographic groups along different dimensions, including gender, ethnicity, etc. Once these neurons are identified, the paper applies a new technique, Bias Neuron Suppression (BNS), to zero out the activations of neurons that are above a threshold score. The paper shows that when identified bias neurons are amplified, demographic gaps increase, and when they are suppressed, demographic gaps decrease. The paper also shows improvement on scores based on StereoSet for measuring the demographic bias of a language model. Finally, the paper also presents interesting empirical results comparing to other debiasing methods, showing for example that the number of bias neurons in FairBERTa does not decrease. Instead, the neurons get shifted into earlier layers compared to networks that have not been debiased. Overall, the paper demonstrates the promise of this new technique."

We counted the number of detected social bias neurons shared by different prompt templates within the same JUT. For example, we counted the number of detected social bias neurons shared among prompt templates within the JUT of (lonely, Black, White). We computed this metric for all the JUTs for a certain demographic dimension (e.g., \"Ethnicity\") and then reported the average. The relatively large values in this column reveal that our IG$^2$ is effective and robust in detecting the social bias neurons without interference from different grammar and sentence structures. \n\n(2) **The \"inter\" column**. We counted the number of detected social bias neurons shared across different JUTs. For example, we counted the number of detected social bias neurons shared between JUT of (lonely, Black, White) and JUT of (lonely, Hispanic, American) using prompt template #1 (prompt templates are defined in Table 3). We randomly selected some prompt templates and paired JUTs to gather this data. The relatively small values in this column reveal that different types of social biases share almost no social bias neurons. This suggests that our IG$^2$ identifies exclusive social bias neurons for different types of social biases."

                        "value": "**Q4: Is there any empirical evidence or motivation, aside from the results here, to support the assumption that single neurons can strongly contribute to demographic disparities?**\n\n**A4**:\nOur motivation comes from the field of neuroscience and its understanding of the working principles of the human brain. The human brain primarily relies on neurons to store information and uses the electrical signals within neurons for information transmission and processing (the process of thinking). Considering the origin of neural networks in computer science arises from the study of neuroscience, we speculate whether this might be similar for neural networks. We wonder if those biased cognitions against marginalized groups might also be stored in some neurons. Some literature has also conducted studies on the behavior of neurons. [1] finds that some classes were represented more selectively than others within networks, suggesting that certain neurons might have a stronger association with specific classes. [2] shows that certain neurons may become specialized in detecting specific features or concepts, where the specialization can potentially extend to features related to social biases. These findings underscore the potential impact of individual neurons on the biases and overall behavior of neural networks, offering empirical backing for the research of locating specific neurons to address biases in language models.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n[1] Ablation Studies in Artificial Neural Networks.\n\n[2] A Survey on Neural Network Interpretability.\n\n**Q5: Is there a way to generalize the method to take into account interactions or correlations between neurons that might affect the result?**\n\n**A5**:\nThank you for your very insightful question! This is a very good and valuable question!\nFirst, quick answer: there should be an appropriate way to generalize both neurons and the interactions among neurons. In fact, we have considered dealing with the interactions among neurons and are currently working on a new project of studying and manipulating these interactions. In contrast to neurons, we refer to these interactions as ''edges''. There are many patterns of edges connecting neurons, e.g., string patterns, square patterns, etc. We believe that by precisely controlling the edges that connect neurons, we can achieve more ideal debiasing results: more accurately blocking the storage and propagation of biases while minimally impacting the model's capabilities. Furthermore, we have discovered that there is a mathematical form that can abstract and generalize neurons and edges: generalizing them into a homogenized minimal unit of neural networks. \n\nHowever, we hope you can understand that we have not mentioned these contents for the sake of clarity in our writing. There are many types of connection patterns for edges, and controlling these edges also involves the study of the propagation and flow of biases among neurons. This part also requires a significant amount of visualization, within which many interesting findings emerge. However, it is impossible to discuss all these contents in one work comprehensively. Therefore, to avoid ambiguity, we have not mentioned the interaction relationships between neurons in this work. To be honest, we are very surprised and excited to see this question. It also gives us much confidence to continue exploring the interactions among neurons. We will further explore this interesting question in the new project and hope to design an appropriate methodology to generalize neurons and edges (interactions among neurons). We hope our work can bring further inspiration to fairness research. Thank you again for your insightful question!\n\n**Q6: Is the method limited by the kinds of prompts in the paper? How would you generalize?**\n\n**A6**: \nWe could expand our approach to include a broader variety of prompt structures that encapsulate different linguistic styles and contexts. Here's an example of a new template: \"In a situation where a [Demographic Dimension] individual is [Context], they are often perceived as [MASK].\" The [Context] slot can be filled with various scenarios or actions, for example, \"leading a team,\" \"making a decision,\" or \"in a family setting.\" This would help in capturing a wider spectrum of potential biases.\n\n**Q7: Can this method be extended beyond differences in sentiment for demographic groups?**\n\n**A7**:\nOur IG$^2$ can be applied to other research fields, e.g., comparative knowledge study. Previous works have found that models trained to learn comparative knowledge have better reasoning ability compared with those trained on singular knowledge. For example, models trained to learn that ''moon is round, not square'' can perform better in reasoning tasks than models trained to learn that ''moon is round''. Our IG$^2$ can be applied to detect neurons contributing to storing comparative knowledge and then amplify the activation of these neurons, in order to achieve better reasoning ability."

To do so, the authors introduce Integrated Gap Gradients (IG2) as an approach to identify neurons attributable to social bias. Their approach is evaluated on a dataset of around 200000 template-generated samples. The evaluation is carried out by either suppressing or amplifying the detected neurons, and the experimental results demonstrate that doing so indeed reduces or increases the generation of biased outputs. Based on these results, the authors propose a debiasing approach based on the suppression of detected neurons and evaluate it on the StereoSet benchmark. Comparing this approach to a range of baselines, the authors show that the method successfully debiases model predictions while at the same time having little impact on unrelated model predictions (measured via the Language Modeling Score)."

We hope the following responses can clarify the missing points and address these concerns.\n\n**Q1: A brief discussion on the usability, practicability, and limitations of their results would be desirable.**\n\n**A1**:\nThank you for your advice! We briefly discuss the implications, practicability and limitations in the following.\n- Implications of the presented results. We propose an interpretable method to analyze social bias in PLMs. Through our experiments, we found that previous debiasing methods, represented by FairBERTa, do not significantly reduce the number of bias neurons but merely alter their distribution (as shown in Figure 3). We believe this finding could bring new insights to the field and inspire other researchers to design more effective debiasing methods.\n- Usability/Practicability. We foresee our findings impacting the development of more equitable language models. On one hand, our method offers good interpretability, providing insights into how to design more efficient debiasing methods. On the other hand, our method can be combined with previous debiasing approaches (such as FairBERTa) to further enhance effectiveness. Mitigating social biases in PLMs also has extensive practical applications. For example, reducing biases in resume screening and job matching, and promoting fair hiring practices.\n- Limitations. While our study provides valuable insights, we recognize there exist limitations. For example, our proposed BNS method directly sets the activation values of selected social bias neurons to zero. Although this is effective, designing a more refined suppression method might yield even better results. These present opportunities for future research. \n\nWe will add a section discussing the implications, practicability, and limitations of our findings in the revised paper.\n\n**Q2: The paper does not discuss potential implications of BNS on other tasks that the investigated LMs are faced with.**\n\n**A2**:\nThank you for the insightful comment! We follow your suggestion and further conduct experiments on the SST-2 dataset (one of GLUE tasks). We report results on the development set of SST-2. The result of RoBERTa-Base is taken from the corresponding paper.\n|Method| SST-2 |\n|-----------------------|-------------|\n|RoBERTa-Base | 92.90 |\n|RoBERTa-Base + BNS (ours) | 92.38 |\n\n**Q3: Did you experiment with regularizing detected neurons rather than suppressing them entirely?**\n\n**A3**:\nWe are very grateful for your suggestion, which is very enlightening for our future work! During the rebuttal, we follow your suggestion and conduct a quick experiment on BERT-Base-cased. We adjust the activation values of the detected bias neurons to 0.5 times their original values, instead of directly setting them to zero. We report the results in the following table. \n\n| Suppression Ratio | SS->50.00 | LMS (\u2191) | ICAT (\u2191) |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| 0                 | 52.78     | 86.64   | 81.82    |\n| 0.5               | 52.95     | 87.08   | 81.94    |\n\n\n**Q4: Recommend moving the introduction of BNS to after the first report of experiments to improve the flow of the paper.**\n\n**A4**:\nThank you for your advice! We have modified our paper accordingly.\n\n**Q5: Would it be worth adding a few examples (rather than only templates) to Table 3?**\n\n**A5**:\nThank you for your advice!

We hope the following responses can clarify the missing points and address these concerns.\n\n**Q1: The technical contribution of the paper is not significant.**\n\n**A1**:\nWe are not \"simply extending a previous existing approach in the context of bias and fairness,\" but have a very clear motivation. In the field of social bias, previous methods mainly require finetuning or even pre-training of PLMs, which is highly costly. We aim to address this issue by proposing an interpretable and efficient method to locate and reduce social biases. Drawing inspiration from the IG approach, we designed our IG$^2$. Our IG$^2$ differs from the IG method: IG is used to analyze singular knowledge attribution, but our method analyzes multiple knowledge. Other reviewers also acknowledge our contribution to the community, for instance, \u201c*The results are promising and might represent a foundation for future work applying the method to other applications in NLP*.\u201d (Reviewer zYP2), and \u201c*I believe that the proposed approaches can have a significant impact on the research community that aims to study social biases and ways to mitigate these issues in large language models*.\u201d (Reviewer auwC).\n\n**Q2: The experiments are done only on masked language modeling tasks which can limit the study.**\n\n**A2**:\nOur method can be applied to other tasks, e.g., autoregressive generation. For example, we could use a prompt such as \"*Please complete the following sentence. The gender of this handsome person is*\". Then we could analyse the logit gap of the first token predicted by the language model. We will further explore this extension in the near future.\n\n**Q3: The approach operates between binary demographics and might be limited when study biases amongst large pool of fine-grained demographics.**\n\n**A3**:\nWe can extend our method to a large pool of fine-grained demographics. The logit gap between pairwise demographics is the most direct metric to reveal the unfairness for different demographics. In fact, to support the attribution of the distribution gap for more than two demographics, we can also choose other metrics that can be applied to measure the degree of dispersion among multiple demographics, such as standard deviation.\n\n**Q4: Their constructed dataset only covers few demographics.**\n\n**A4**:\nTo study social bias more systematically, we constructed our dataset with 19 pairs of demographics, totaling 38 demographics, even including socioeconomic status, which is rarely studied in existing fairness studies. We believe the demographics used in the paper cover a wide enough range (this is recognized by Reviewer auwC: \"*I really liked that the paper makes an extensive evaluation, including a large number of demographic attributes as well as modifiers*\"). We want to point out that previous works [1,2,3,4,5,6] often only analyze one or two demographic dimensions.  However, we understand the concerns of the reviewer and will consider adding more demographics in the future to make the work more comprehensive.\n\n &nbsp;\n\n[1] Mitigating Political Bias in Language Models Through Reinforced Calibration.\n\n[2] Investigating Gender Bias in Language Models Using Causal Mediation Analysis.\n\n[3] The Woman Worked as a Babysitter: On Biases in Language Generation.\n\n[4] From Pretraining Data to Language Models to Downstream Tasks: Tracking the Trails of Political Biases Leading to Unfair NLP Models.\n\n[5] Gender and Representation Bias in GPT-3 Generated Stories.\n\n[6] Language Models Get a Gender Makeover: Mitigating Gender Bias with Few-Shot Data Interventions.\n\n**Q5: The paraphrases for constructing the dataset are generated using a language model which can impose its own biases in the study.**\n\n**A5**: \nWe use a language model to generate templates with placeholders (such as ([Demographic_Dimension], [Modifier], and [MASK])) only, without including any specific demographics, as shown in Table 3. Therefore, this process does not introduce any biases from the language model itself.\n\n**Q6: Why are some approaches missing for FairBERTa in Table 5?**\n\n**A6**: \nWe guess that you are referring to the absence of \"FairBERTa+DPCE\" and \"FairBERTa+AutoDebias\" in the table. FairBERTa, unlike the other two baseline models (BERT-Base-cased and RoBERTa-Base), is a debiasing method based on RoBERTa-Base. Therefore, we did not combine it with DPCE or AutoDebias. We combined BNS with FairBERTa in the table to demonstrate that our method is not only superior to FairBERTa alone but also achieves better results when combined, proving the plug-and-play capability of our approach."

                        "value": "We would like to thank the reviewer for the constructive comments! The following are our detailed responses regarding all major concerns. We hope the following responses can clarify the missing points and address these concerns.\n\n**Q1: Does the method only work when the output of the model is to predict the sensitive attributes (so that you can calculate the logit gap)? How can we extend it to other tasks instead of predicting the sensitive attributes?**\n\n**A1**: The proposed methods can be extended to other fields and tasks (e.g., comparative knowledge study) without predicting sensitive attributes. Previous works have found that models trained to learn comparative knowledge have better reasoning ability compared with those trained on singular knowledge. For example, models trained to learn that ''moon is round, not square'' can perform better in reasoning tasks than models trained to learn that ''moon is round''. Our $IG^2$ can be applied to detect neurons contributing to storing comparative knowledge and then amplify the activation of these neurons, in order to achieve better reasoning ability.\n\n**Q2: How can we extend it to hate speech detection?**\n\n**A2**: \nWe think the proposed method could not be directly applied to the hate speech detection task. As far as we know, the target of the hate speech detection task is to design a detection model and judge whether some given sentences contain toxic or discriminative expressions. Biases or toxicity are not generated by the detection model, but exist in the text input. In contrast, our method is to attribute biased output to model internal neurons. This requires that biased sentences are generated by the model we focus on.\n\n**Q3: What model is being examined in Fig.2? Does the conclusion hold for all models, especially for FairBERTa?**\n\n**A3**: \nThe model examined in Fig.2 is FairBERTa. We have also reached similar conclusions for other models (BERT and RoBERTa). We have revised the caption to make it clearer. \n\n**Q4: It seems Union_IG can make the bias score lower. Is it because Union_IG contains more neurons? Does this mean adding more neurons helps reduce the bias? How sensitive is the result w.r.t. $\\sigma$?**\n\n**A4**: \n(1) No. Sometimes Union_IG contains fewer neurons than $IG^2$. The reason for Union_IG making the bias score lower is that Union_IG contains all the neurons that affect the learned knowledge about different demographics. Therefore, when we suppress all the neurons detected by Union_IG, the model forgets almost all the knowledge about these demographics. In other words, the model is hard to identify these demographics in this circumstance. For example, the model may not know what is \"Black\" or \"White\". This will severely impair the language model\u2019s capability. \n\n(2) Yes, adding more bias neurons helps reduce social biases, but at the cost of sacrificing the capabilities of language models. \nTherefore, we need to strike a balance between reducing social bias and maintaining the capabilities of language models.\n\n(3) The result is not very sensitive to $\\sigma$. We report the ablation studies on BERT in the following table.\n\n| \\sigma       | SS->50.00 | LMS (\u2191) | ICAT (\u2191) |\n|--------------|-----------|---------|----------|\n| 0.1*maximum  | 52.13     | 85.01   | 81.39    |\n| 0.2*maximum  | 52.78     | 86.64   | 81.82    |\n| 0.3*maximum  | 52.99     | 86.77   | 81.58    |\n| 0.4*maximum  | 53.15     | 86.82   | 81.35    |"

We first study the impact of amplifying or suppressing the neurons detected by Intersection_IG on the logits gap (an experiment similar to that in Figure 2). From the table below, we find that neurons detected by Intersection_IG do not have direct relations with the manifestation of social biases. For example,  both amplifying and suppressing neurons lead to a decreased ratio in the logits gap of \"Physical Appearance-P\".\n\n| JUT                   | Suppression | Amplification |\n|-----------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Gender-N              | 19.62       | -6.07         |\n| Gender-Ner            | 4.13        | -0.26         |\n| Gender-Nest           | -1.35       | -3.82         |\n| Gender-P              | 0.06        | 7.49          |\n| Gender-Per            | -10.45      | -16.10        |\n| Gender-Pest           | -0.96       | -0.08         |\n| Physical Appearance-N | -5.99       | 0.12          |\n| Physical Appearance-Ner | 8.97      | 10.41         |\n| Physical Appearance-Nest | -0.93    | -0.48         |\n| Physical Appearance-P | -13.74      | -20.19        |\n| Physical Appearance-Per | 15.52     | 8.83          |\n| Physical Appearance-Pest | -6.08    | -0.49         |\n\nWe also present the results on Stereoset as below.
