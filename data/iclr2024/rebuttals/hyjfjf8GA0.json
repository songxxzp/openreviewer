Perhaps this is in part due to my lacking certain pieces of background, but I do feel like I am at least somewhat in the target audience of this paper. Here are a few writing concerns, in no particular order.\n\n1. Many technical terms are not defined, some of which are fundamental to understanding the paper. These things ought to have formal, mathematical definitions considering their importance to the paper. Some examples:\n\n    a. Sec 2.1: What is a \"population\", and what does it mean for a population to be \"heterogeneous\"? \n\n    b. Sec 2.2: What is \"gradient exchange\"?\n\n    c. Sec 2.2.1: I understand x and y to stand in for a^i and a^ii respectively. Is this accurate? In any case this should be stated.\n\n    d. Sec 3: \"Generalist\" should be defined formally\n\n1. Should I be considering a partially-observable game, or a fully-observable game? The prelims suggest partial observability, but e.g. policies are conditioned on states, which suggests full observability\n1. My understanding is that the setting is a two-player zero-sum game. In that setting, a player should never correlate its action with the opposing player, i.e., the mutual information (8) should always be 0 in equilibrium. Why, then, is it interesting to consider (or, indeed, to optimize) the mutual information?\n\nThe experimental results seem reasonable, but my ability to parse them is essentially limited to \"I see figures in which the current paper seems to do well\".  \n\nDue to the writing issues alone, I don't think this paper is publishable in the current state. I vote to reject. If the authors could perform a revision that improves the quality of writing and explanations, I would read such a revision and may change my score. \n\nNitpicks (not affecting evaluation):\n\n1. $*$ should probably not be used as a generic multiplication symbol---prefer $\\cdot$ (or simply juxtaposition)\n1. Some brackets are improperly sized, e.g., Eq (3)\n1. Sec 2.2.1: Shouldn't the integral be actually a sum, since at the end of the day these training algorithms operate in discrete time?\n1. $\\log$ should always use the backslash, i.e., not $log$.\n1. It's a bit confusing to use Roman numerals to index the players; why not just use standard Arabic numerals (1, 2, ..., N), as is consistent with most game theory literature?\n1. Preliminaries typo: $S : O \\times O$ doesn't parse\n1. The paper contains a large number of grammatical errors, too many to enumerate. Proofreading would go a long way.\n1. Eq (10): it should be explciitly stated that $\\mathbb H()$ is the joint entropy (assuming that it actually is)."

We appreciate the reviewer's feedback and have revised our paper to address the concerns. \n\n$\\textbf{Q1:}$ What is a \u201cpopulation\u201d, and what does it mean for a population to be \u201cheterogeneous\u201d?\n\n$\\textbf{A1:}$ A population refers to a set of agents that are trained simultaneously in a population-based training framework. A population is considered heterogeneous if the agents have different attributes, such as height, weight, etc.\n\n$\\textbf{Q2:}$ What is \u201cgradient exchange\u201d?\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ Gradient exchange is a technique that allows agents to share their gradients with each other during training. This can facilitate exploration, diversity, and coordination among the agents.\n\n$\\textbf{Q3:}$ I understand x and y to stand in for a^i and a^ii respectively. Is this accurate? In any case this should be stated.\n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ Yes, the reviewer is correct. We will make clarification in paper's revision.\n\n$\\textbf{Q4:}$ \u201cGeneralist\u201d should be defined formally\n\n$\\textbf{A4:}$ A generalist is a policy that controls a population of agents that the training objective is such that the policy can be applied to a heterogeneous agent population. We have added a formal definition of generalist in the paper.\n\n$\\textbf{Q5:}$ Should I be considering a partially-observable game, or a fully-observable game? The prelims suggest partial observability, but e.g. policies are conditioned on states, which suggests full observability\n\n$\\textbf{A5:}$ We consider both partially-observable and fully-observable games in our paper. During competition, individual agents only observe their individual observations. After a competition, for example rock paper scissors, all agents see what the other agents have done. Liu et al. 2022's proposed condition neural net of NeuPL takes advantage of this by letting all agents jointly optimize on all agent\u2019s experience. In other words, during training the fully observable experiences are used to train all agents. We have made this distinction more clear in the paper.\n\n$\\textbf{Q6:}$ My understanding is that the setting is a two-player zero-sum game. In that setting, a player should never correlate its action with the opposing player, i.e., the mutual information (8) should always be 0 in equilibrium. Why, then, is it interesting to consider (or, indeed, to optimize) the mutual information?\n\n$\\textbf{A6:} We agree that in a two-player zero-sum game, the mutual information between the actions of the players should be zero in equilibrium. However, we are interested in the problem setting of population learning via self-play and policy gradient optimization. In this context, Eq. (3) is the result of (x and y) versus (x\u2019 and y\u2019), where (x\u2019 and y\u2019) are (x and y)\u2019s opponent. As proposed by Liu et al 2022, NeuPL can make the two policies\u2019 optimization more efficient by jointly optimizing them under a single conditional policy (conditioned on x and y\u2019s id). The neural architecture of NeuPL is a single conditioned policy that jointly optimizes a population of agents. In Liu et al 2022\u2019s paper, they showed that there is a Skill Transfer effect that makes agents\u2019 learning more efficient. Our paper also finds the training would be more efficient, but at NeuPL\u2019s convergence, it would not be optimal. Optimal here means there is still room for improvement for the individual agents to further improve.\n\nWe are making the necessary changes in our paper this week. The revision will be underlined in red, to address the above symbols and provide a clearer understanding of our work. We value your feedback and welcome any further questions. If our answers is satisfactory, we kindly ask to consider increasing the score of our paper."

For example: you say that \"A population is considered heterogeneous if the agents have different attributes, such as height, weight, etc.\", but I don't know what an \"attribute\" of an agent is in a general (PO)MDP.\n\nHere's an example of a formal definition (just making up symbols. This is probably not close to what you actually want to define, but it's just to give a sense of what I mean by *formal*)\n\n**Definition:** A collection of training algorithms (one per agent) is called *heterogeneous* if the policy played by each agent depends only on the training data (observations, actions, rewards) observed and played by that agent.\n\nFor example, this definition would rule out training algorithms involving centralized control/advice, weight sharing, etc.\n\n(By the way, I'd normally use the word \"uncoupled\" to describe my above definition, so in the small chance that the above is actually the definition you want, I'd advise switching terms to be more in line with standard language in game theory)\n\nThe informal, plain-language definitions given by the authors are good for intuition, but in a technical paper I would expect more formalism along the above lines, especially for notions that are new to this paper. \n\nI will keep my score. I recommend a major revision in which the authors formalize important definitions along the lines that I have mentioned."

As proposed by Liu et al 2022, NeuPL can make the two policies\u2019 optimization more efficient by jointly optimizing them under a single conditional policy (conditioned on x and y\u2019s id).\n\nQ2: Also in Eq. (3), why do two policies share the same parameter \\theta_\\tau? Shouldn\u2019t they have their own different parameters?\n\nA2: The neural architecture of NeuPL is a single conditioned policy that jointly optimizes a population of agents. In Liu et al 2022\u2019s paper, they showed that there is a Skill Transfer effect that makes agents\u2019 learning more efficient. Our paper also finds the training would be more efficient, but at NeuPL\u2019s convergence, it would not be optimal. Optimal here means there is still room for improvement for the individual agents to further improve.\n\nQ3: In the first line of the PRELIMINARY, N={1,2,\u2026,N} is bad notation.\n\nA3: We agree that this notation is confusing and we will change it to N={1,2,\u2026,n}.\n\nQ4: Right after Eq. (1), the definition of Q(s,a) and V(s, id) are the same?\n\nA4: We agree that the definition ought to be different. Q(s,a) is the state-action value function, which is the expected return starting from state s and taking action a. V(s, id) is the state value function for agent id, which is the expected return starting from state s and following the policy of agent id. We will make this distinction more clear in the paper.\n\nQ5: Also in this line, what is the definition of id? It is the first time it appears but without being properly defined.\n\nA5: id is the agent index, which ranges from 1 to n. We will define it before using it in the paper.\n\nQ6: what is the definition of T? What is the policy gradient integral over?\n\nA6: T is the total duration of training. Policy gradient integral over the change of parameter (over the training duration).\n\nWe have made the necessary changes in our paper with red line highlighting the changes.

While the paper has emphasized the disadvantage of \"generalist\", the proposed method (at least, Equation 10) still depends on the policy of the \"generalist.\"  Does the proposed method rely on the existing method to learn the policy of the \"generalist\"?

                        "value": "We are delighted that the reviewer recognizes the strengths of our paper, including the well-motivated research questions, insightful theoretical analysis, and the reasonableness of the proposed solution. We appreciate the constructive feedback and have made revisions to our paper accordingly. Here are our responses to the specific questions:\n\nQ1: What does the term w(x,y) of mutual information (defined in Equation 8) correspond to?\n\nA1: The term w(x,y) of mutual information is first introduced by Guiasu 1977 in \u201cINFORMATION THEORY AND A STOCHASTIC MODEL FOR EVOLUTION\u201d. It is defined as the expected weighting over a set of random variables. In the context of Multiagent Policy Gradient, this expected weighting corresponds to the expected advantage function (Q-V) for all agents, jointly optimized under a single conditional neural net. This denotes the weighting of agents x and y on whether a policy change towards Q leads to a better policy than the existing estimated expected value of V. We have added this explanation immediately after Equation 7 in the revised paper for clarity.\n\nQ2: There seems to be a typo in Equation 10. Could you clarify the terms in this equation?\n\nA2: We apologize for the typo in Equation 10. The * has been replaced with a dot product symbol ($\\centerdot$) in the revised paper. Equation 10 illustrates agent k's optimization of behavior to gain an advantage relative to a population of Generalists. The term $V(s,id^{k}) \\centerdot \\mathop{\\mathbb{H}}(a^{g}, a^{k})$ represents the relation of agent k's expected value and the entropy of the joint action distribution of agent k and the Generalists. The term $Q(s,a^{k},id^{k}) \\centerdot - \\mathbf{\\mathop{\\mathbb{H}}(a^{g}, a^{k})$ represents the expected value of agent k's specific state and action, weighted by the negative entropy of the joint action distribution. We have added an explanation of these terms immediately after Equation 10 in the revised paper.\n\nQ3: Does the proposed method rely on the existing method to learn the policy of the \"generalist\"? How does the proposed method strike a balance between being a \"generalist\" and being a \"specialist\"?\n\nA3: The proposed method does rely on the existing method to learn the policy of the \"generalist\". The policy of the \"generalist\" is learned by optimizing a set of population behavior that would be, in general, competitive for the population. Our approach of JEM optimizes agents\u2019 individual\u2019s policies as a population of \"specialists\". To optimize the agent\u2019s policy gradient not based on what would be optimal for the general population, but what would be advantageous for each agent to deviate from the population norm (As \u201cspecial\u201d is a relative term to the term what is considered \u201cgeneral\u201d). The proposed method aims to fully optimize agent\u2019s individual potential rather than striking a balance as the case study we performed is in the scenario of noncooperative game. The goal would be to enable each agent to achieve individual optimality amongst the population.\n\nWe have made the necessary changes in our paper with red line highlighting the changes.

                        "value": "We are delighted to hear that the reviewer find our paper interesting and the use of tools based on information theory relevant. We thank the reviewer for their interest and constructive feedback on our paper. We have revised our paper accordingly and addressed the questions as follows:\n\nQ1: On Page 3, what is 'id' in the inputs of V(s,id)?\n\nA1: The 'id' input is a variable that indicates the identity of a game player. For example, in a game of chess, if a player moves first, 'id' may be set to 0 and to 1 if the player moves second. This 'id' input is a key feature that enables the NeuPL model architecture, where each agent in a population has an 'id' to compete in an environment.\n\nQ2: On Page 4, is 'N' a set composed of two elements which represent the indices of two players? If so, why is there 'k = i...N' in the following line?\n\nA2: Yes, the reviewer is correct. 'N' is a set of two elements that represent the indices of two players. This is initially used to examine Skill Transfer when there are 2 agents trained under one conditional neural net. We wrote 'k=1...N' because we later extend the analysis to more than 2 agents, where 'N' could be any integer greater than 2.\n\nQ3: On Page 5, equation (9), could you please give or recall the definition of 'w'?\n\nA3: The weight of the Interaction Information term 'w' is defined as the expected weighting over a set of random variables. In the context of Multiagent Policy Gradient, this expected weighting would be the expected advantage function of (Q-V) for all agents jointly optimized under a single conditional neural net.\n\nQ4: On Page 6, definition of '$\\psi^k$', could you please clarify how '$\\psi^k$' in the left-hand side affects the right-hand side? Also, is the '\\psi' a typo and, if not, what is its meaning?\n\nA4: The term '$\\psi^k$' influences the right-hand side by altering the policy action distribution of '$a^k$', in terms of the action probability distribution entropy $\\mathbb{H}$. The full equation is quite extensive, but its explicit form is shown in equation 15 as '$\\pi_{\\psi^k}(a^k|a^g,s,id^k) log(\\pi_{\\psi^k}(a^k|a^g,s,id^k)$'. The * in the right-hand side is a multiplication sign. We have changed it to $\\centerdot$ as dot product in the paper revision to make it clearer. \n\nWe have made the necessary changes in our paper with red line highlighting the changes. We value the reviewer's feedback and welcome any further questions. If our answers is satisfactory, we kindly ask to consider increasing the score of our paper."
