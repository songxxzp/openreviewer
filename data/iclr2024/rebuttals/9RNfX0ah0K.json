This approach raises doubts about the theoretical correctness of the framework, as it heavily relies on empirical validation rather than providing rigorous theoretical proofs throughout the paper.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion of global optima analysis for RBF kernels. We are open to any more concrete pointers. However, our primary goal is to work with the more complex NNGP kernels due to their relation to NNs, for which we are not aware of any techniques that allow a theoretical analysis of the global optima of LOOD.\n\nThe experiments for GPs are not done to complement proofs. Our analytical results for GPs are entirely independent of the numerical experiments, which we summarize as follows.\n- Stationary condition (Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 4.1) and second-order condition (Lemma D.4) of the LOOD optimization problem for a general class of kernel functions. Notably, the second-order condition (Lemma D.4) suffices to prove that mean distance LOOD is **locally maximal** when the query equals the differing data. \n- Complete theorems and proofs for how the activation choice affects the magnitude of LOOD in Proposition 5.1 and Proposition H.1. \n\nInstead, the numerical experiments for GPs are meant to (1) **confirm the analytical results** (e.g., Figure 2 (a)(b) and Figure 5 - NNGP curve); (2) **show the practical usefulness** of these analytical results (e.g., Figure 1, 4 and 14-19 shows how we can experimentally optimize LOOD to precisely reconstruct each training data, thus reflecting the usefulness of the stationary condition and second-order condition for LOOD); and (3) **compare** with prior **experimental** approaches for estimating information leakage, influence and memorization in quality (Figure 3) and efficiency (Footnote 4). \n\nFinally, we highlight that while introducing an analytical framework, one of our ultimate goals is to enable successful applications and insights for deep neural networks beyond theory. For this reason, we conduct a variety of experiments on deep neural network models to show how LOOD enables efficient and accurate estimates for influence, memorization, and information leakage (Figure 3) and how the analytical conclusions for LOOD generalize to neural networks (Figure 2 (c) regarding the stationarity and local optimality of LOOD and Figure 5 - NN curve regarding the effect of activation function choice on LOOD). \n\n\n> W2 & Q1: The paper extensively analyzes the LOOD under RBF and NNGP kernels. While these are commonly used kernels, the generalizability of the results to other types of kernels or models is not clear. The paper could be strengthened by either extending the analysis to other kernels or by providing a clear justification for focusing on these specific kernels. \n>\n> Does the approach of modeling the randomness of models using Gaussian processes have general applicability beyond neural networks?\n\nOur analysis for LOOD under GPs generally only requires weak regularity conditions that the kernel functions need to satisfy. For example, in Theorem 3.1 and Proposition 4.1 for proving the stationary condition, we only require the kernel function $K$ to be normalized (i.e., $K(x, x) = 1$ for any data $x$) and $\\frac{\\partial K(x, x)}{\\partial x} = 0$ for any data $x$. Theorem 5.1 also applies to any bounded kernel functions. Consequently, our analytical results easily extend to kernel functions that satisfy these conditions, such as the general isotropic kernels [Proposition D.2] and correlation kernels [Proposition D.3]. \n\nThis paper focuses on the NNGP kernel function because we are interested in using LOOD for neural network models. To this end, the NNGP kernel is one of the most suitable kernel functions for our applications, as NNGP captures the infinite-width limit of neural networks. See Appendix B.2 for detailed discussions on how NNGPs connect to neural networks."

However, for other potential attack methods, is there a way for LOOD to measure their privacy capabilities?\n\nThis is a good observation. The definition of LOOD is equivalent to distinguishability in a membership inference game, i.e., the prediction distributions of models trained on two neighboring datasets are indistinguishable. Such indistinguishability against membership inference is known to be fundamental, e.g., the existence of a strong attacker in the leave-one-out reconstruction game necessitates the existence of a strong membership inference attacker [a, Section II.D].\n\nThis fundamental indistinguishability against membership inference is also the underlying intuition for differential privacy [b]. See our [response to reviewer rJTi](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9RNfX0ah0K&noteId=AmWjCVXOqL) for a detailed discussion on the connection between LOOD and DP. DP has been shown to imply indistinguishability against more advanced attribute inference games [c, d] or reconstruction games (see [a, Section VII], [e], and [f]). Therefore, similar to differential privacy, LOOD can also be used for semantically measuring the advantage of various inference attacks, such as reconstruction and attribute inference attacks. See [Section 5.2][e] for a concrete example of how KL divergence (also used in defining LOOD) translates to upper bound on the advantage of attribute inference attack.\n\n**References**\n- [a] Balle, B., Cherubin, G., & Hayes, J.

                    "value": "This paper introduces a notion of algorithmic stability called *leave-one-out distinguishability*. For a learning algorithm that outputs a predictor, a pair of data sets $D$ and $D'$ that differ in a single record, and a specific query point $Q$, LOOD captures: how much does the algorithm's prediction on $Q$ change between $D$ and $D'$? This is a notion of local stability. The paper formalizes \"change\" through either KL divergence or average prediction, depending on the application. We also sometimes allow the data sets to differ in multiple points, or allow $Q$ to be a set of queries.\n\nThe paper aims to both unify existing work on memorization and influence and to answer questions about specific learning procedures. It contains a large number of both theoretical and experimental results. The theory results focus on Gaussian processes, while the experiments supplement these theorems and also show how the results can extend to neural networks.\n\nAfter introducing the definition, we move to Section 3, which addresses the question of what query point maximizes LOOD. We see strong theoretical and experimental evidence pointing to the conclusion that, for GPs, the optimal query is the point that differs between $D$ and $D'$. (Nonconvexity makes establishing global optimality difficult.) We see an experiment with some evidence that the story is similar for neural networks.\n\nSection 4 relates LOOD to existing notions of memorization and privacy. Most interesting to me is Figure 3a, which shows that data points tend to have similar susceptibility to membership inference attacks under NNGPs and NNs. We also see that GPs are vulnerable to data reconstruction attacks.\n\nFinally, Section 5 explores how the activation function affects NNGPs and NNs. We get a theorem about the rank of NNGPs and complementary experiments on both classes of models."

To elevate the paper, I would hope for a stronger answer to \"what can we do now that we could not do before?\" The paper gives answers about GPs, but I find these a bit underwhelming: I do not expect kernel methods to protect privacy.

                        "value": "> **Q1:** When having coffee with other researchers, which results from this paper are you most excited to discuss? **W1:** My largest critique of LOOD is that I feel it lacks a \"killer application\" which cleanly shows off its value... I would hope for a stronger answer to \"what can we do now that we could not do before?\"\n\nUnderstanding how each training data influences the prediction of the trained model on query data is a **canonical** problem to understand DNNs. It allows answering essential questions such as whether data X is used in training a model (Shokri et al., 2017), how robust the model is to removing data X from its training dataset (Koh & Liang, 2017; Koh et al., 2019; Pruthi et al., 2020), and how much does the model memorize individual training data (Feldman, 2020; Feldman & Zhang, 2020). Our driving motivation is to develop a framework that enhances the understanding of data influence on models. This framework aims to facilitate more efficient and interpretable answers to existing questions and to enable us to explore new questions about how a data point influences model predictions. Here are the interesting contributions of the paper:\n1. We show how the estimations of information leakage, influence, and memorization are **intrinsically the same problem**. We propose one framework \u2013 leave-one-out distinguishability \u2013 that solves this problem accurately (Sections 4.1 and 4.3) and efficiently (Footnote 4).\n2. For more advanced questions (e.g., what prediction leaks the most information, how the network activation choice affects leakage, and what is the joint influence of a group of training data), prior approaches [Shokri et al., 2017; Feldman & Zhang, 2020;Koh & Liang, 2017; Koh et al., 2019; Pruthi et al., 2020] are heavily based on experiments. Consequently, these prior approaches inevitably involve training many models under different training datasets or network architectures to analyze these advanced questions. Due to the experimental nature, conclusions derived from such approaches also tend to suffer from instability due to the large amount of uncontrollable experimental randomness. By contrast, LOOD is an analytical framework and allows one to efficiently and accurately answer such questions (Figure 2, Section 3, Section 5, Appendix E.2.) without the need for training any models \u2013 it only requires computing the NNGP kernel function using neural networks at initialization.\n3. Lastly, the analytical nature of LOOD enables performing optimization to identify predictions that leak the most information about each training data record (Section 3 and Section 4.3), which enables exact reconstruction of each training data (Section 4.2). Such an optimization framework for influence sheds light on many interesting open problems, which prior experiment-based methods suffer from huge computation cost and experimental instability. We elaborate these new questions in response to Q2.\n\n\n> **Q2:** Which results in this paper will have the biggest impact on future research?\n\nWe show that using the divergence metric (instead of the empirical mean distance) enables a precise measure of influence, to the extent that it allows very accurate reconstruction of training data. The new definition as well as the analytical framework can be used to answer (optimization) questions regarding what causes memorization, and what reflects the influence of memorized data.\n \n- LOOD offers an analytic estimation of influence, memorization, and information leakage that agrees well with experimental observations (Figure 3, Section 4.1 and 4.3). \n  - This is a training-free approach that is attractive in computation efficiency. \n  - Due to the analytical nature, LOOD complements prior experimental approaches (that suffers from large computation cost and numerical instability). LOOD allows accurate and efficient analysis for advanced questions, such as how the prediction data (Section 3) and the activation function (Section 5) choice affect information leakage for each training data. It is an exciting open problem to use LOOD to analytically study how other factors affect information leakage, such as the training data (distribution) and architecture choices.\n- We showcase how to optimize LOOD to identify the prediction that leaks the most information and how this enables exact reconstruction for each training data (for NNGPs). \n  - As NNGPs are closely connected to their corresponding neural networks, such results shed light on designing more powerful reconstruction attacks against deep neural networks by optimizing empirical approximations of the LOOD objective. \n  - Additionally, such results illustrate that the leakage in revealing the complete prediction distribution (rather than one sample) is so high that exact reconstruction is possible. This implies a trade-off between accurate uncertainty estimation and information leakage and calls for training algorithms that adequately consider (and optimize) these trade-offs."

                        "value": "> The paper gives answers about GPs, but I find these a bit underwhelming: I do not expect kernel methods to protect privacy. (Of course, people who do not work on privacy may have different expectations.) \n\nWe would like to highlight one major difference between GPs and kernel methods: Gaussian process explicitly models the randomness in the algorithm, while kernel methods only models the posterior mean of the Gaussian process regression. Therefore, GPs are more suitable for modeling randomized training algorithms than kernel methods. For example, we are able to compute finite LOODs for predictions using GPs, which has privacy implications on various inference attacks, is connected to the fundamental membership inference game, and connects to differential privacy (see our [response to Reviewer s1Kq (2/2) [W3 & Q2]](https://openreview.net/forum?id=9RNfX0ah0K&noteId=tzkLvhOubI) for more detailed discussion).\n\nFinally, although we acknowledge that the correspondence between GPs and neural networks is only exact under **infinite** width, we would like to highlight that experimentally the agreement between LOOD and actual leave-one-out retraining is consistently high (Sections 4.1 and 4.3) for deep neural networks. This demonstrates the usefulness of using LOOD for NNGPs to model the influence and information leakage for NNs."

This is defined as the statistical distance (in this case, the KL-divergence) between the output distributions of the model on changing a few data points in the dataset. The main applications or advantages of introducing this notion of LOOD is that LOOD could be used to quantify (1) the memorization of data, (2) the leakage of information (via membership inference attacks), and (3) the influence of certain training data points on the model predictions. In this work, the applications of LOOD are illustrated via Gaussian processes, which they use to model the randomness of the machine learning models. They also show the effect of activation functions on LOOD. From their empirical results, they show LOOD as a good measure for all the above phenomena."

As in, DP algorithms guarantee that a few data points cannot influence the output of the algorithm a lot, so will LOOD give any useful information about DP ML algorithms?\n\n**Regarding the connection between DP and LOOD**\n\nAt the core, DP and LOOD are closely related. They both quantify the privacy risk of including a data point in the training set by evaluating the divergence in the algorithm's output distribution on neighboring datasets. LOOD calculates the privacy loss for individual samples in a black-box setting, whereas DP, in its current application, determines the maximum white-box privacy loss across all possible datasets.\n\nIn the black-box setting, the threat model assumes that an adversary can access only the predictions made by a model, related to the scenario with API access to models. Conversely, DP addresses privacy loss under a stronger white-box threat model, where the adversary is assumed to have full access to the parameters of the trained model. The guarantee provided by DP certainly applies to the black-box setting too, but its primary analysis is done for the stronger adversary scenario in the white-box setting.\n\nThere is a difference between the notions of divergence used in LOOD versus DP. LOOD is defined by the KL divergence between distributions, while standard DP is equivalent to bounded hockey-stick divergence between distributions. The closest DP definition to LOOD is the R\u00e9nyi DP definition (as R\u00e9nyi divergence with order $\\alpha \\rightarrow 1$ is equivalent to KL divergence).\n\n**Will LOOD give any useful information about DP ML algorithms?**\n\nDP guarantees that the prediction distributions cannot change beyond a certain bound under the change of one training data. However, such a guarantee reflects the worst-case scenario and the same bound holds for **any** possible training data and query. Thus, DP's bound doesn't discern the privacy risk of specific data points in certain training sets and queries. DP doesn't indicate if some predictions pose higher information leakage risks. LOOD, however, helps explore how information leakage varies with different predictions, which prediction leads to the most leakage, and how leakage evolves with more predictions, as detailed in Figure 2, Section 3, and Appendix E.1."
