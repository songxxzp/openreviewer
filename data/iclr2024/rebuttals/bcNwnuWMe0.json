Although there are some experimental support to this, it is difficult to draw this conclusion because the authors have only tried a limited set of models. As the claim is counter-intuitive, more analysis, especially analysis of the raw data, is required for supporting the claim. Are there correlations between the water level in two gauge stations upstream and downstream? And are there time lags between between a spike in an upstream gauge station and a downstream gauge station? If so, the spike in the upstream gauge station should be useful for predicting the spike in the downstream gauge station.

Since we are interested in predicting flood, which is a rare event, fitting the average MSE loss to the time series data might not be the best approach. Assuming the floods are rare large spikes in the data, a conservative model will do best by trying NOT to predict a large spike, as getting the timing of the spike wrong can incur a huge MSE loss. It could, for example, be modeled alternatively as a time series prediction problem, where we try to predict if there is a flood event within the next 6 hours given the water level in the past 24 hours.

However, such an approach requires ground-truth annotations of all flooding events, which the dataset unfortunately does not provide. Hence, the only option with the given data is regression of river discharge. On the other hand, the datasets that do have flood annotations are lacking the graph structure. We apologize for not having made this clear in the draft and updated Section 3.1 accordingly.\n\n---\n\n> The key issue with the current paper is the message is mostly a negative result, that incorporating the network structure does not help with the forecast of flood.\n\nWe believe that especially unintuitive negative results should be published to highlight the finding to the community. This may motivate other researchers to investigate the issue from their different viewpoints and complete the picture.\n\n\n---\n\n> Although there are some experimental support to this, it is difficult to draw this conclusion because the authors have only tried a limited set of models.\n\nThe set of models we employed is actually quite large: 3 major architectures times 18 topology combinations and each cross-validated on 6 different folds of a big dataset, which amounts to 324 models. This does not include the additional 240 models for the depth experiment. While we agree there are more architectures and choices that can be explored, we had to restrict our search space to retain computational feasibility. This issue would be mitigated by publishing our results so the community can address the problem with its accumulated computational resources."

Statistically, we also find linear cross-correlations, but the corresponding shift naturally varies.\n\n---\n\n> How long does it take on average for the flow from one upstream gauge station to reach a neighboring downstream gauge station? I think these values should be taken into account for the history window size (24 hours currently) and the prediction horizon (6 hours currently). \n\n> And are there time lags between between a spike in an upstream gauge station and a downstream gauge station?\n\nWe argue that the time lags are not relevant for prediction since the flow fluctuation and spikes will ultimately be reflected in the downstream gauge station's own discharge history.\n\n---\n\n> What is the sample size for each gauge station? Or more importantly, what is the average number of flood events that each gauge station experience in the data? If the sample size is small, it could be beneficial to just pool all the data and train one model for the time series prediction of rare events, than to spread the rare event samples across multiple stations and try to model their correlations. Could that be a reason why the incorporation of network structure is not helping here?\n\nPooling across all gauges, as suggested by the reviewer, would contract the river network graph into a singular point, thus making any topology considerations meaningless. There is a body of research on improving discharge prediction by training on pooled data from multiple gauges, but that caters to an entirely different research question than the one we are addressing.\n\n---\n\n> The authors claim that the methods perform similarly. From Table 2 it seems to be true for NSE, but MSE has a lot more variations across the different methods. Why is this the case?\n\nDischarge scale across gauges varies massively. The MSE we show in Table 2 is not scale-normalized, while NSE is (cp. Section 3.2, Metrics). Hence, MSE is highly sensitive to even minor errors on gauges in broad waterbeds. However, we want the model to do equally well on all gauges of the river network. For this reason (among others), hydrology papers typically look at scale-normalized metrics such as NSE. We only included the non-scale-normalized MSE for completeness. Note that during training, the data is normalized, and thus, the optimization objective an implicitly scale-normalized MSE. We updated the caption of Table 2 to prevent any potential confusion in this regard."

Specifically, the authors splitter 18 years of data into 6 folds of 3 years of data and conducted cross-validation. I found it hard to be convinced of any conclusion derived from such setup. For example, in one of the 6 runs where training data happen to include data in 2014 and the prediction data happens to include data in 2013 - in that case, a model trained with future information is used to predict the past - unless there is no auto-correlation at all, otherwise, such future leakage will undermine the conclusion made from such numerical results. With such concern, it may not necessary be that topology information does not contribute to forecasting future river discharge, but rather, since the model has already known about the past and the future about the river discharge, such topology information may not add any information any more. In practical settings where only historical information is known, having such topology information could still yield accuracy gain - well this is just a hypothesis assuming the experiment is properly set up such that no future information is leaked."

It is encouraging that they view our contribution, its presentation, and reproducibility as valuable to the community. The reviewer's only concern is with regard to our validation process, which we would like to untangle in the following.\n\n---\n\n> For example, in one of the 6 runs where training data happen to include data in 2014 and the prediction data happens to include data in 2013 - in that case, a model trained with future information is used to predict the past - unless there is no auto-correlation at all, otherwise, such future leakage will undermine the conclusion made from such numerical results.\n\nIndeed, with the vanilla cross-validation setup, some test years lie before the training years. In this vein, the model is also assessed as to its performance on past data it has not seen. This is a valid desideratum and has nothing to do with any \"future leakage\" since we are not trying to build a production model but are interested in the general effect of topology information on predictive capabilities from a data analysis standpoint. The only possible source of actual future leakage would be in the construction of supervised input-output samples; however, our sampling strategy enforces the temporal relationship of \"input < output\" (cp. Section 3.2, Features & Targets).\n\n---\n\n> With such concern, it may not necessary be that topology information does not contribute to forecasting future river discharge, but rather, since the model has already known about the past and the future about the river discharge, such topology information may not add any information any more.\n\nWhile it is true that in this case, the model has seen data from past and future years, it has not seen any data from the current year it is tested on, so the graph structure can still add information at prediction time, as it makes a portion of the current year's data (the past 24 hours) from neighboring gauges available.\n\n---\n\n> My suggestion is to re-run the experiment with backtest settings instead of cross-validation settings.\n\nWe would like to note that backtesting is, in fact, the *opposite* of what the reviewer describes. By definition, backtesting refers to validating the model on only *past* inputs to verify that it would have also predicted past events accurately. Its wide use in financial time series analysis confirms that testing on the past is not an issue per se."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer\u2019s positive feedback on the relevance of our work and their detailed questions coming from a physics/hydrology angle.\n\n---\n\n> If the model is intended to be used for flood forecasting rather than general daily flow forecasting, the training and testing process used in this study may not be appropriate. Instead of evaluating an entire period of record, flood forecasting models typically identify individual events within the historical flow record using an approach such as peak over threshold.\n\nThe problem with approaches like peak over threshold is that they assume one can tell a flood event solely from the discharge value. However, the presence of flooding does not necessarily depend only on discharge but many other factors like soil moisture and the height of river dikes which, to make matters worse, do change over time. Hence, it is totally unclear how to set the threshold hyperparameter appropriately. A proper event-focused approach would only work if we had expert flood annotations as part of the dataset, which is not the case (see also reply to Reviewer FSEP).\n\n---\n\n> Aside from Figure 4, which is described as the worst case scenario, no graphical results are shown to demonstrate the behaviour of the model.\n\n> Given the negative results, additional attempts should be made to identify and demonstrate how/why the model is failing. Graphical analysis of results for a few sites would help to evaluate this.\n\nIt seems questionable how a qualitative inspection of forecast plots would help in identifying the cause of the topology-informed models failing to outperform the baseline. Since we found the models for all topology combinations to perform very similarly, those plots consequently look very similar, and there is hardly anything to infer from them. Thus, we only included plots for the worst-case gauge that highlight the issues all of the model combinations struggle with.\n\n---\n\n> It seems that the choices of 6 hours and 24 hours for the lead time and lookback windows, respectively, are arbitrary. The flood wave celerity between stations under typical flood peaks could be computed from the historical flow records to make an informed decision on how to select this window, ensuring that peaks have enough time to travel between stations. Do the selected values allow for appropriate travel time for most stations?\n\nThey are rather arbitrary but chosen high enough to allow for appropriate information propagation. Flood wave celerity could only be computed from the records if we had flood annotations, which is not the case (see also reply to Reviewer FSEP).\n\n---\n\n> What did the results look like on the best-performing stations? Were flood peaks predicted with errors in timing or magnitude, or did the model fail to predict them at all?\n\nSince the dataset does not provide flood annotations, we cannot know which peaks in the discharge time series are associated with floods and which are not. In favor of conducting responsible research, we refrained from making any blunt assumptions along the lines of \u201cdischarge above x implies flood\u201d. The consequence is that we cannot look at individual flooding events but only at the regression performance.\n\n---\n\n> Is it reasonable to perform element-wise normalization for a graph where the value of nodes relative to adjacent nodes is important? Additionally, have you considered that these absolute values (i.e. flows) may affect flood wave celerity (i.e. changes in discharge under Manning\u2019s equation)?\n\nWhat matters is the fluctuations of the neighbor\u2019s features (discharge and meteorological indicators) over time rather than the absolute value. If we only applied some global normalization to all gauges, we would run into severe numerical issues due to the vastly differing feature scale across gauges."
