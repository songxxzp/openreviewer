The central contribution is the evaluation of some prominent post-training methods such as SLiC, DPO, and SFT. This leads to some valuable conclusions for the post-training of LLMs. Furthermore, the paper proposes integrating a data curriculum learning scheme into DPO and SFT. Comprehensive experiments are conducted, revealing that a proper choice of the setting for contrastive post-training for LLMs is very beneficial."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "I\u2019d like to see this paper as an empirical study of contrastive post-training for LLMs, offering extensive comparisons among different methods and demonstrating effective combinations of them. Given this, however, I'm not pretty sure the contribution possesses sufficient novelty for acceptance at ICLR. As it stands, venues focused on empirical methods might be more appropriate.\n\nThe paper's narrative appears disjointed. While the introduction emphasizes an affordable method of generating human preference data, the experimental section seems to underscore the comparison of post-training techniques. The title predominantly focuses on curriculum learning. Despite showing positive effects, the inclusion of curriculum learning seems unnecessary. The rationale behind combining curriculum learning with post-training is not extensively discussed.\n\nThe use of curriculum learning is not strongly related to contrastive post-training. While it is totally fine to introduce any methods into this work, This makes the focus of the work somewhat scattered. \n\nThe central theme of the paper is aligning LLMs with human preferences; however, evaluations solely rely on GPT-4, neglecting human evaluations."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. Table 4 suggests that the number of training epochs significantly impacts model performance. It appears that the model parameters haven't fully converged after just one epoch of training. Figure 2 shows that the curriculum-based experiments also operate on a one-epoch basis. Given that curriculum learning can potentially hasten model convergence, one wonders if the advantages of data curriculums arise from its training efficiency. If both models, with and without data curriculums, are trained over three epochs, would the performance of post-training with data curriculums still outstand?\n\n2. The paper's direction seems ambiguous. If this work is to be perceived as innovative, the authors highlight in the introduction that using existing LLMs to generate offline preference data is both cost-effective and efficient. However, from this standpoint, the authors do not delve deeper in subsequent sections. For instance, the authors could have compared the effectiveness of preference data annotated by human with that generated by models, or they could have discussed potential noise issues in model generated preference data. Conversely, if this work is more analytical, the paper invests significant time in determining the superior post-training strategy, an emphasis missing from the introduction."

Core experiments include fine tuning two versions of LlaMa 7B (vanilla and fine tuned with ChatGPT responses, called SFT-3.5). Many configurations are tested, including supervised finetuning using ChatGPT responses, GPT-4 responses, using SLiC and DPO techniques, on both LlaMa and SFT-3.5. Conclusions are provided, showing that DPO is the most effective technique for fine tuning, using stronger examples as positive ones is better and training for longer provides better results.\nAn ablation analysis shows that, with the same pairs, RLHF and RLAIF do not reach similar performance to what DPO is capable of.\nFurther experiments are carried out showing that the technique can be scaled up to a bigger language model such Orca+.\nFinally, an experiment using curriculum learning, varying the quality of the answers to more powerful LM provides a further but minor improvement."

The novelty seems to be using different language models as a source of  positive / negative examples, but similar techniques were already used on reward models such as RRHF (Yuan et al 2023).\n\nThe abstract, introduction and conclusion are not completely aligned. While the abstract claims that authors \u201cexplore contrastive post-training techniques for alignment by automatically constructing preference pairs from multiple models of varying strengths\u201d, both the intro and the conclusions claim that the authors propose \u201ca new setting for contrastive post-training large language models\u201d. Either authors propose existing techniques or propose a new one.\n\nWhile the paper is titled \u201c... on Data Curriculum\u201d, this aspect plays a minor role in the entirety of this work. Only table 7 and sections 5.5 cover the experiments on this aspect. Only a single curriculum technique is explored (using 2 levels of hardness and varying the proportion through training). Results on this configuration are modest and only prove that curriculum works."

As the primary contribution of the work is to run experiments comparing extant methods, issues in the comparison of those methods are especially impactful to the overall value of the work.\n\nThe paper has numerous significant issues in readability that can be easily resolved to improve the clarity of the work. Model names are used to refer to models and datasets produced by those models interchangeably and without warning. The experimental setup is complicated, and this serves to obfuscate it further, and makes reading the paper much harder than it needs to be. This is thankfully very easy to fix. The \n\nSec 5.5: The curriculum experiments are missing the baseline of a uniform distribution of the mixture of easy/hard datasets (ie training on the mixed datasets without any curriculum). Without this baseline it is impossible to assess the relative contribution of the curriculum itself, as opposed to just having a larger and more diverse dataset. Additionally, the curriculum experiments are missing analysis or discussion that might explain the value or implications of the results."

                    "value": "Is the construction of positive/negative pair sequences via sampling from \"superior\" and \"inferior\" models a novel contribution? If so, please state as much. If not, please provide a citation.\n\nTable 4 / Section 5.2.\"Which is the best for post-training?\" : while it is understandable to have resource constraints on running large experiments with many models, the significant gap between the 1-epoch and 3 epoch SFT / DPO runs (65.1 -> 72.8 Alpaca win % for SFT-3.5 -> SFT on D_{GPT4}, and 70.4 -> 77.3 Alpaca win % for SFT-3.5 -> SFT on D^{GPT4}_{td003}) suggests that the model performance is far from convergence at 1 epoch. This makes it difficult to take seriously the relative performance of all the 1-epoch training runs presented in the table. This is especially true for the comparison of the different training methods, as it is highly plausible that their training curves may have different characteristics, making a 1-epoch comparison not necessarily indicative of final converged performance. \n\nIn Section 5.1 and onwards, model names are overloaded with *datasets* generated from those models. For example \"GPT-4\" is used to refer to the model previous to sec 5.1, but then afterwards is used to refer either to the model itself or the datasets generated from the model (ie. \"GPT-4 vs. td003, GPT-4 vs. ChatGPT\"). Consider doing something like *D*_{GPT-4} to refer to the dataset of gpt-4 generated examples, and *D*^{gpt4}_{chatgpt} to refer to the contrastive dataset with positive *D*_{GPT-4} and negative *D*_{chatgpt} outputs. \n\nThe use of X 'vs' Y is also overloaded, as occasionally it refers to head-to-head model output comparison (as in Table 1) and sometimes it refers to a contrastive dataset combining outputs of two models. This would be fixed by adopting the *D*^{X}_{Y} notation convention.\n\nAdditionally, in Sec 5.1 you introduce \"td003\" as an alternative name for InstructGPT without any comment as to the convention you are establishing there. Please say explicitly \"We use td003 to refer to the dataset generated by InstructGPT\" (or preferably *D*_{td003}) or something along those lines. Later on in Sec 5.2 (Which pair should we train DPO on?) you go back to using \"InstructGPT\" to refer to the dataset... \"GPT-4 vs. InstructGPT\". \n\nFigure 1 cartoon could be modified to improve clarity. If you didn't know what RLHF or constarstive post-training were, it would be difficult to assess from the figure.\n\nFigure 2 and Table 7 do not use the same nomenclature, which makes it difficult to parse what is going on. Table 7 refers to EasyPair and HardPairs, but Figure 2 does not feature either. It is difficult to parse what is going on in Table 7 due to the notational inconsistency. Please make much more clear which datasets (/curricula) are being used. Preferably by using \"EasyPair\" and \"HardPair\" rather than their constituent datasets, as the most relevant piece of information in the curriculum context is the relative difficult rather than the absolute source. Again, using D_{X} notation will significantly help here. \n\nTable 4: \n\"SFT-3.5\" sounds like a modification on SFT, which is a training method, rather than the model that is being modified by SFT. Maybe rename to LLAMA+ / LLAMA_{SFT} / LLAMA_{ChatGPT}? \"3.5\" being used as stand-in for ChatGPT without explanation or precedent is also confusing. Also, is the model referred to as SFT-3.5 the final trained model of the first row of the Table? If so, please clarify in the Table heading.\n\nAlso consider putting the 3-epoch runs below the 1-epoch runs that they correspond to, in order to improve the capacity to compare between the two. Is it possible the \"crippling reward hacking\" of the RLAIF setup can be alleviated with careful tuning? \n\nTable 6: what is the bolding convention being used here? Please describe in the table header. Also, please include the comparison of Orca+DPO vs Orca 13B.\n\nNit:\nTable 3: \"despite its response is unreadable\" --> \"despite its response being unreadable\""
