It shows confusion and unclear, reader can not catch information from it\n\n2. Limited experiments. The experiments cannot support the arguments the paper proposes.\n\n3. For the federated learning optimization results, the authors only put the final model average performance after training is finished.   However, the training stableness is also an important indicator to evaluate the performance of an FL algorithm. The model-performance vs. #communication round figures should be present in the paper. Especially, pruning within training possibly introduces unstable training factors.\n\n 4.  The paper states their introduced budget-aware extrusion can maintain pruning efficiency while preserving post-pruning performance, which is a key contribution of this paper. However, there are no experiments that direct point to this argument. This is a key points that stands FedRef from other baselines, and readers expect to see more persuasive experiments on it. \n\n5. The proposed pruning method introduces extra communication overhead, such as the transfer of the masking. Evaluation on communication cost and comparison to baselines is also important.\n\n\n6. Limited model architecture to be tested. To show the proposed method is universal, more neural architecture can be evaluated."

Federated learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized edge devices without direct data sharing. However, existing federated pruning techniques face challenges of significant accuracy loss after pruning and high activation memory usage. To address these issues, FedMef introduces two key components - budget-aware extrusion and scaled activation pruning. Budget-aware extrusion transfers essential information from low-magnitude parameters marked for pruning to others to minimize information loss. Scaled activation pruning allows pruning activation caches to reduce memory footprint without compromising accuracy. Specifically, it leverages Normalized Sparse Convolution layers for more effective activation pruning even with small batches. Experiments on image classification datasets demonstrate FedMef's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, reducing memory footprint by 28.5% while boosting accuracy by over 2%. The proposed techniques enable efficient on-device federated learning to develop specialized sparse models that meet accuracy and memory constraints."
