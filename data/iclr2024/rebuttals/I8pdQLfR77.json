A key innovation in this work is the introduction of a novel activation function, termed AGeLU. Additionally, a convolution layer has been meticulously crafted to bolster the spatial information within the module. Extensive experimental results are provided in the paper by applying the IMLP module in diverse vision transformer architectures. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can help the transformers obtain similar performance with fewer parameters by reducing the hidden channels of MLP modules."

                        "value": "**Q1: The AGeLU's standalone performance appears suboptimal. Table 2 suggests that the primary performance improvements stem from knowledge distillation or spatial enhancement, with the paper lacking a clear demonstration of the enhanced non-linearity's effectiveness, i.e., the proposed AGeLU.**\n\n**A1:** There are some misunderstandings and we are sorry for the unclarity. \n\nFirstly, **we do not use KD in our proposed method**. As shown in the first paragraph of section 4.3, using KD method can enhance the performance but will also increase the GPU memory during the training process, which is not feasible to use when the size of the model grows larger. Thus, we propose our spatial-enhancement part in section 4.3. The KD result in Table 2 is only proposed for the completeness of the experiment. This is explained more clearly in Table 2 of the revised version.\n\nSecondly, the usefulness of the channel-wise enhancement part is shown in Table 2 and Table 3. The performance gains indeed come from depthwise convolution (spatial-wise enhancement part). However, **the proposed AGeLU+concat (channel-wise enhancement part) copes very well with dwconv** and can reduce FLOPs and parameters while maintaining accuracy to the greatest extent possible. For example, as shown in Table 2, DeiT-Ti with dwconv only increases 0.6% Top1 accuracy compared to original DeiT-Ti model (compare Line 1 and Line 4). However, by adding AGeLU+concat, DeiT-Ti with dwconv can increase 2.1% Top1 accuracy (compare Line 2 and Line 5) while saving over 10% FLOPs and parameters to the original model (Line 1). Thus, **the proposed spatial and channel enhancement part should be treated as a whole** to enhance the nonlinearity from two different aspects, and achieve the goal of reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. \n\nFor Table 3, we ablate using the original MLP module (Line 1) and its AGeLU counterpart (Line 2). We also give **the proposed IMLP module with AGeLU+concat (Line 4)** and its GeLU counterpart (Line 3). The result shows that our method of using AGeLU+concat is very useful, and there are some explanations at the end of page 7. We add more explanations below. Line 1 and Line 2 have similar performance since they all have the same degree of nonlinearity according to Eq.2 (the form of original MLP), no matter $\\phi=GeLU$ or $\\phi$=AGeLU. The reason why Line 4 is much better than Line 3 comes from Eq.6. When using two different AGeLUs, we have different $\\alpha_{c\u2019}$ and $\\alpha_{c\u2019}'$ to form $t_1$ and $t_1\u2019$ in Eq.6. Thus, the output can be expressed as the linear combination of $C\u2019$ different nonlinear functions. However, when using two GeLU functions, we have $\\alpha_{c\u2019}=\\alpha\u2019_{c\u2019}=1$. Thus, the output can only be expressed as the linear combination of $C\u2019/2$ different nonlinear functions. \n\n**Q2: There is ambiguity regarding whether the kernel size is consistently set to 5 for large-scale models such as DeiT-B or Swin-B, lacking a definitive explanation in the paper.**\n\n**A2:** Sorry for the unclarity. In fact, we found that the ratio of the computational cost of the MLP module will increase as the scale of the model becomes larger, thus replacing the original MLP module the IMLP module will reduce more FLOPs and parameters and it is harder to make up for the accuracy drop with kernel size=3. Therefore, we consistently set kernel size to 5 for large-scale models.\n\n**Q3: The remarkable performance drops attributed to the addition of GeLU with four times the number of channels raise questions. Since the fully connected (fc) layer entails linear calculations, it appears that the addition operation merely doubles the original output, which requires further clarification.**\n\n**A3:** I believe you are talking about the results shown in Table 4. In fact, the experiments in Table 4 use the following equation to replace the original MLP module, i.e., $y=AGeLU_1(x)+AGeLU_2(x)+\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot+AGeLU_{4C}(x)$. The reason we conduct this ablation study 4 is shown at the beginning of section 4.1. Table 4 is a straightforward way to use the combination of $C^\u2032=4C$ different nonlinear functions to replace the original MLP module. However, based on Corollary 1 (3) in the paper, the bias that depends on the input elements makes it challenging to attain a comparable degree of non-linearity by merely combining multiple nonlinear functions, and the classification performance does not match that of using the original MLP module. This is more clearly explained in the second last paragraph of section 5.2 in the revised version.\n\n**Q4: Introducing spatial enhancement after the GeLU operation (as 'a' in Figure 4) would help to conclusively demonstrate the impact of enhanced non-linearity in parameter reduction.**\n\n**A4:** If my understanding is correct, the result of using spatial enhancement after the GeLU operation is shown in Line 4 of Table 2 (w/ spatial)."

However, as shown at the beginning of section 4.3, the degree of freedom is related to the number of channels in each part, and dividing the MLP module into more parts will decrease the degree of freedom and thus make it hard to achieve a good result. We conduct experiments using two and four nonlinear functions and the results are shown below. We can see that using four nonlinear functions gives a worse classification accuracy compared to using two nonlinear functions, which is consistent with our analysis.\n\n|Model|\tFLOPs|\tParams|\tacc|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|2 nonlinear functions|\t1.10|\t5.00|\t72.6|\n|4 nonlinear functions|\t1.01|\t4.55|\t68.6|\n\n**Q2: In Section 4.3, there lack of comparative experiments with other non-linear blocks like bottleneck in ResNet or linear bottleneck in MobileNetV2, which could have showcased the unique advantages or potential shortcomings of the proposed method in a broader context.**\n\n**A2:** Note that in the original MLP module in different vision transformers, the number of hidden dimensions is four times the input dimensions, which is similar to the architecture of an inverted bottleneck. This is the reason we use the inverted bottleneck in section 4.3. The linear bottleneck has the same hidden dimensions and input dimensions, and the original bottleneck in ResNet has fewer hidden dimensions than the input dimensions, which are not our first choices. The results of different blocks are shown below, and we can see that using an inverted bottleneck gives the best result. In the experiments, as the linear bottleneck and bottleneck will reduce the hidden dimensions, we increase the embedding dimension of the networks to make the FLOPs of different models roughly the same for a fair comparison.\n\n|Model|\tFLOPs|\tParams|\tacc|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|Inverted bottleneck|\t1.10\t|5.00|\t72.6|\n|Linear bottleneck|\t1.14|\t4.97|\t69.9|\n|Bottleneck|\t1.11|\t4.72|\t62.2|\n\n**Q3: The proposed IMLP module has only been experimented with a few models like ViT and Swin, which have been proposed for several years. It raises the question of the module's effectiveness on more recent, higher-accuracy models like iFormer. The validation of the IMLP module across a broader spectrum of models could provide a clearer picture of its versatility and efficacy in current vision transformer landscapes.**\n\n**A3:** We conduct experiments not only on classic models that have been proposed for several years such as ViT and Swin, but also on the latest published popular models such as PoolFormer and portable models LVT which are all published in 2022. We conduct experiments on iFormer-S (NeurIPS 2022) model and the results are shown below. It shows that our method can reduce FLOPs and parameters while keeping the classification performance on iFormer.\n\n|Model|\tFLOPs|\tParams\t|acc|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|iFormer-S|\t4.848|\t19.866|83.4|\n|iFormer-S + IMLP|\t4.330 (-10.7%)|\t17.528 (-11.8%)|\t83.3|"

However, this drawback can be largely eased on other computing devices such as CPU, NPU and FPGA, and the advantage of IMLP with fewer FLOPs and parameters can appear. In fact, DW conv is widely used in mobile devices and there are many papers published to speed up dw conv [1], [2].\n\n[1] High Performance Depthwise and Pointwise Convolutions on Mobile Devices. AAAI, 2020.\n\n[2] Designing efficient accelerator of depthwise separable convolutional neural network on FPGA. JSA, 2019.\n\n**Q2: No actual latencies are provided for the proposed models and the throughput is more critical than the number of parameters and FLOPs for real applications.**\n\n**A2:** The throughputs with batch_size=32 are shown in the following table. We conduct experiments on the DeiT model and the results are added in the appendix of the revised version. Throughputs on other models will be added in the final version. We can see that although the latency improvements on GPU are marginal, **the improvements on CPU are obvious** and they come from the decrease of FLOPs, which shows the priority of our method. We use V100 GPU and Intel 6136 CPU @ 3GHz CPU in the experiments.\n\n|Model|\tThroughput (imgs/s) on CPU|\tThroughput (imgs/s) on V100|\n|-|-|-|\n|DeiT-Ti|\t63.6\t|988.6|\n|DeiT-Ti+IMLP|\t69.9 (+9.9%)|\t1003.6 (+1.5%)|\n|DeiT-S|\t40.0|\t596.6|\n|DeiT-S+IMLP|\t42.9 (+7.3%)|\t604.3 (+1.3%)|\n|DeiT-B|\t20.3|\t275.6|\n|DeiT-B+IMLP|\t22.1 (+8.9%)|\t277.8 (+0.8%)|\n\n**Q3: From Table 3, I can't see a solid improvement from AGeLU.**\n\n**A3:** Table 3 shows that AGeLU is not useful when using it alone (compare Line 1 and Line 2), and **this is not used in our method**. They are listed here for the completeness of this ablation study. In fact, our proposed channel-wise enhancement part with AGeLU+concat has a non-negligible 0.3% accuracy improvement compared to using GeLU+concat (compare Line 4 and Line 3). Thus, we need to **treat the channel-wise enhancement part as a whole and a solid improvement can be seen**. More explanation of Table 3 can be found at the end of page 7."

                        "value": "Thanks for your contrastive comments.\n\n**Q1: This paper primarily addresses the activation functions, but many related works are missing, which have emerged after GeLU.**\n\n**A1:** This is a good question and we will add the corresponding related works. **Note that we actually propose a general arbitrary nonlinear function in Eq.3 rather than a specific AGeLU**, and the basic function $\\phi$ in Eq.3 is not restricted to the GeLU function. As shown in the last sentence in the paragraph below Eq.4, other basic activation functions can be extended using the same way. The reason we chose GeLU as the basic function is because the activation functions used in the baseline models are GeLU. In the following table, we change the activation function in DeiT from GeLU to SoftPlus, and apply our method using ASoftPlus. The results show that we can achieve consistent improvement regardless of the usage of basic activation functions (The experimental results are added in the appendix of the revised version). Other activation functions such as ELU, ReLU6 and Swish will be added in the final version.\n|Model|FLOPs|Params|acc|\n|-|-|-|-|\n|DeiT with SoftPlus|\t5.72|1.26|71.6|\n|+ IMLP|\t5.00 (-12.6%)|\t1.10 (-12.7%)|\t72.0|\n\n**Q2: The performance enhancements provided by the proposed activation function are marginal and non-existent in some instances. The proposed activation function fails to improve accuracy in larger models like Deit_B and LVT-R4; moreover, it actually leads to a decline in performance for Swin-B and Poolformer-M48.**\n\n**A2:** The proposed IMLP aims to reduce the computational cost while maintaining the classification performance compared to the baseline model, rather than improve the accuracy only. As shown in **Figure 1**, the proposed method has **a better FLOPs-Accuracy trade-off** among all the baseline methods. This is because the FLOPs can reduce significantly with a slight or no performance drop.\n\n**Q3: The main issue identified by the reviewer is the performance gains of this work appear to depend largely on employing depthwise convolution, which has been already recognized in many prior hybrid architectures. The ablation studies presented in the manuscript further underscore this reliance as well. As a result, the paper's contribution is considered to be very limited.**\n\n**A3:** This is also a very good question. The performance gains indeed come from depthwise convolution (spatial-wise enhancement part). However, **the proposed AGeLU+concat (channel-wise enhancement part) copes very well with dwconv** and can reduce FLOPs and parameters while maintaining accuracy to the greatest extent possible. For example, as shown in Table 2, DeiT-Ti with dwconv only increases 0.6% Top1 accuracy compared to original DeiT-Ti model (compare Line 1 and Line 4). However, by adding AGeLU+concat, DeiT-Ti with dwconv can increase 2.1% Top1 accuracy (compare Line 2 and Line 5) while saving over 10% FLOPs and parameters to the original model (Line 1). Thus, the proposed **spatial and channel enhancement part should be treated as a whole** to enhance the nonlinearity from two different aspects, and achieve the goal of reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy. \n\nBesides, although many papers have used dwconv in their transformer, they do not give a thorough analysis of the reason it works (which is also mentioned at the end of page 1). In this paper, we treated **dwconv as the enhancement of nonlinearity** which explains the usefulness of dwconv in a new perspective.\n\n**Q4: This paper needs more experiments to justify the claim: Experimental comparisons with simple activation functions such as SoftPlus, ELU, ReLU6, Swish, and so on are not compared. Downstream tasks in the Appendix contain limited results with a few backbones.**\n\n**A4:** Thanks for the suggestion. The results of using SoftPlus are shown in the answer of Q1. Other activation functions and experiments on more downstream tasks will be added in the final version due to the limited rebuttal period.\n\n**Q5: It is speculated that the proposed method's effectiveness relies on KD (Table 2 evidently shows this), which requires a teacher model. Consequently, training budgets may not be preserved equally.**\n\nA5: This is a misunderstanding and we are sorry for the unclarity. **We do not use KD in our proposed method**. As shown in the first paragraph of section 4.3, using KD method can enhance the performance but will also increase the GPU memory during the training process, which is not feasible to use when the size of the model grows larger. Thus, we propose our spatial-enhancement part in section 4.3. The KD result in Table 2 is only proposed for the completeness of the experiment. This is explained more clearly in Table 2 and the corresponding explanation of the revised version."

                        "value": "**Q6: The reviewer acknowledges that while the theories included do enhance the paper, it lacks a crucial explanation\u2014specifically, the rationale behind why AGeLU with concatenation is necessary has not been addressed via theory.**\n\n**A6:** The reason for using AGeLU with concatenation is shown in Eq.2 (the form of original MLP) and Eq.6 (the form of MLP using AGeLU with concatenation) and also in the last paragraph of section 4.1. I will try to explain it more clearly in the following. \nWe can rewrite the last line of Eq.6 into the form:\n\n$\\mathbf y'=\\mathbf t_2 \\mathbf W^e=\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{C'}w_{jc}^e\\cdot[\\beta_{j}{\\rm{GeLU}}(\\alpha_{j}\\sum_{i=1}^{C}w_{i,f(j)}^dx_i+\\gamma_{j})+\\theta_{j}] \\right)_{c=1}^C$\n\n$~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~=\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{C'}w_{jc}^{'e}{\\rm{GeLU}}(m_{cj}'x_c+n_{cj}')+\\theta_{j}\\right)_{c=1}^C,~~~~~~~~Eq.6'$\n\nwhere $w_{jc}^{'e}=w_{jc}^{e}\\cdot\\beta_j$, $m_{cj}'=w^d_{c,f(j)}$ and $n_{cj}'={\\rm{func}}(x_1,\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,x_{c-1},x_{c+1},\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot,x_C)=\\sum_{i=1,i\\neq c}^C{w_{i,f(j)}^dx_i+\\gamma_{j}}$.\n\nThis is almost the same as Eq.2. According to Corollary 1, the output of Eq.2 and Eq.6\u2019 can both be expressed as the combination of C\u2019 different nonlinear functions with distinct scales and biases, in which the scales are learnable weights independent to the input and the biases are dependent to the input.\n\nThe only difference between Eq.2 and Eq.6\u2019 is that the degree of freedom of  $w_{jc}^{'e}$ in Eq.6\u2019 is halved compared to the original $w_{ij}^a$ in Eq.2. Thus, it is harder to optimize Eq.6\u2019 and may degrade the performance, as shown in the first paragraph in section 4.3.\n\nThe above analysis is added near Eq.6 in the revised version.\n\n**Q7: The proposed variant of GeLU is not exclusively applicable to vision transformers. It can also be utilized in architectures like ConvNeXt, which shares similar building blocks, excluding self-attention, where the proposed element could serve as a replacement for standard GeLUs.**\n\n**A7:** This is true. However, the analysis in this paper is based on a 2-layer MLP module and thus is only applicable to vision transformers. Using it to ConvNeXt and other MLP networks is a really good topic and future work that is worth discussing.\n\n**Q8: Please specify how KD works when training with the proposed activation function.**\n\n**A8:** **We do not use KD in our proposed method.** The KD result in Table 2 is only proposed for the completeness of the experiment (please see A5 for more explanation). In detail, we transfer the knowledge from the output of each original MLP module in the teacher model to the output of each proposed IMLP module in the student model. Also, the classification probabilities are also distilled.\n\n**Q9: The reviewer highlights Table 3, noting it presents a surprising and crucial result of the study. The authors are requested to provide insights or intuitions into why such an outcome occurred.**\n\n**A9:** Some of the explanations are shown at the end of page 7. In fact, Line 1 of Table 3 stands for the original MLP module, and Line 2 changes the GELU function to AGeLU. These two architectures have similar performance since they all have the same degree of nonlinearity according to Eq.2 (the form of original MLP), no matter $\\phi$=GeLU or $\\phi$=AGeLU. \n\nLine 4 of Table 3 is the proposed IMLP module using 2 different AGeLU functions with concat, and Line 3 uses two GeLU functions with concat. The reason why Line 4 is much better than Line 3 comes from Eq.6. When using two different AGeLUs in Line 4, we have different $\\alpha_{c\u2019}$ and $\\alpha_{c\u2019}'$ to form $t_1$ and $t_1\u2019$ in Eq.6 in the original paper. Thus, the output can be expressed as the linear combination of $C\u2019$ different nonlinear functions. However, when using two GeLU functions in Line 3, we have $\\alpha_{c\u2019}=\\alpha_{c\u2019}'=1$. Thus, the output can only be expressed as the linear combination of $C\u2019/2$ different nonlinear functions. \n\n**Q10: The results in Table 4 are not clearly explained.**\n\n**A10:** Sorry for the unclarity. In fact, the explanation of Table 4 is shown at the beginning of section 4.1. Table 4 is a straightforward way to use the combination of C\u2032 different nonlinear functions to replace the original MLP module. However, based on Corollary 1 (3) in the paper, the bias that depends on the input elements makes it challenging to attain a comparable degree of non-linearity by merely combining multiple nonlinear functions, and the classification performance does not match that of using the original MLP module. \n\n**Q11: Why is the additional shortcut needed for the dwconv and BN should follow it subsequently?**\n\n**A11:**  Many researchers found that learning the residual of the output is easier than learning the original input, and BN can normalize the input for better optimization. We found that using BN and shortcut can achieve a better result than not using it through empirical experiments."

                        "value": "Thank you for the responses to my concerns. Some of my concerns still remain:\n- The authors argue that their method combined with depthwise convolution (dwconv) leads to a significant improvement of +2.1pp from a 70.5 baseline, compared to dwconv alone, which offers only a +0.6pp improvement from a 72.2 baseline. However, this comparison is questionable because the 70.5 baseline itself is lower due to using a less effective GELU variant. Table 3 indicates that AGeLU alone does not beat GELU, and while AGeLU with concatenation does offer some improvement (+0.4pp), it's still less than the +0.6pp by dwconv. This suggests that dwconv contributes more to the overall improvement. (plus, there's a minor concern about whether the comparison in Table 3, particularly in terms of the number of parameters and FLOPS, is fair).\n\n- I was curious about the need for an additional shortcut with BN, given that there's already a shortcut outside the MLP block, which would make the extra shortcut redundant.\n\nCurrently, while the authors have addressed many concerns, key experiments and materials should be revised, crucial for strengthening the manuscript might not be feasible in this round; I will keep my rating."

                        "value": "**Answer to new Q1:**\n\nWe should explain Table 2 in this way. In the first line, the original DeiT-Ti model has 72.2% accuracy. After adding the AGeLU+Concat, the performance on line 2 decreased to 70.5% while at the same time has less FLOPs and parameters. Then, we add dwconv and the performance increases +2.1pp and reaches 72.6% at line 4. The +2.1pp improvement is much more significant than adding dwconv alone to the original DeiT-Ti model which has +0.6pp improvement at line 3. Thus, gathering AGeLU+Concat with dwconv is particularly useful and should be treated as a whole.\n\nOverall, using the channel-enhancement part alone decreases the performance while at the same time reducing FLOPs and parameters, using the spatial-enhancement part alone increases the performance but also increases FLOPs and parameters. Gathering both of them can get a better accuracy-FLOPs trade-off.\n\nIn Table 3, Line 1 and Line 2 has the same FLOPs and parameters, and Line 3 and Line 4 have the same FLOPs and parameters. Thus, the comparison between GeLU & AGeLU and GeLU+concat & AGeLU+concat are fair.\n\n**Answer to new Q2:**\n\nIt is not a redundant shortcut. We can give the equation of IMLP module without using shortcut in the spatial-enhancement part as $y = x + FC(Spatial(z))$, where $z=Channel(FC(x))$. When using shortcut, the equation becomes $y = x + FC(Spatial(z)+z)$. Since there are non-linear activations in $Spatial(\\cdot)$ (GeLU function as shown in Figure 4 (b)), the $Spatial(z)+z$ part cannot be merged. \n\nBesides, we found a practical performance improvement by using shortcut and BN.\n\n**Currently, while the authors have addressed many concerns, key experiments and materials should be revised, crucial for strengthening the manuscript might not be feasible in this round.**\n\n**Answer:** Most of the explanations are already shown in the original paper and we only need to reorganize them. Minor experiments can be moved to the appendix to save space for important experiments and materials. These modifications are already updated in the revised paper so that you can check them."
