This is of particular relevance in gradient-based optimization for inverse problems, where discontinuities in gradients of the MC estimate with respect to input parameters are either non-differentiable, or lead to incorrect results.  By sampling line segments instead of points, the parametric gradients become well-defined and differentiable."

The theoretical correctness of their proposed sampling method is proved (i.e. that it remains an unbiased estimator)."

Specifically, the rendering application is evaluated using only qualitative (not quantitative) results, on a single scenario.  The topology optimization example is also evaluated on only a single example -- while it is understandable that the authors specifically acknowledge that in-depth evaluation of this task is lacking, stating that this is not the central focus of the paper, it brings into question the meaningfulness of this experimental result.  In the case of the convex hull example, no comparison to alternative methods is provided.  (I would personally find a slightly more in-depth investigation of fewer applications to be more enlightening, though I do not expect the authors to drastically alter their existing experiments).\n\nThere seem to be missing key references w/r/t the claimed applications, for example, in the case of differentiable rendering and simulation.  Are such references considered to be out of the scope of the paper?  As mere examples, in the case if differentiable rendering (by no means an exhaustive list):\n- Merlin Nimier-David and Delio Vicini and Tizian Zeltner and Wenzel Jakob.

                        "value": "Thank you for taking a close read of our work and dedicating the time to review it. We agree that a comprehensive and deep investigation of just one or two applications is often the right approach. We felt some tension around this ourselves, but in this work, our aim was to establish the generality of our method, as applied to several (seemingly) disparate areas of application. \n\nThe tradeoff in doing so is that each of these application areas are research areas in their own right of course (which we can\u2019t do justice to within a few pages of writing). That is all to say, the core (application-oriented) claim we are making is that our method solves a novel problem with a surprisingly far reach in applications. Further work could, for example, exhaustively analyze fiber Monte Carlo applied to topology optimization, but this work is about explicating the fundamental method. Note that we evaluate topology optimization on two examples, not one (though again, we of course could have evaluated three, or seven). \n\nWe considered differentiable rendering more broadly to be out of scope of the paper, exactly in the spirit written above (although we are fans of the work you listed). We chose to consider image stylization specifically because it is an appropriate target for fiber Monte Carlo, and no general method had been used to achieve stylization in the literature. Further, it\u2019s worth noting that image stylization is an application which lacks a great/insightful quantitative metric. Technically one frames the application as an optimization problem, but this isn\u2019t the complete picture since solving the problem as posed would not actually result in a stylized image (the minimum of the objective is attained by rendering the original target image perfectly, which hardly \u201cstylizes\u201d it). Here we felt the relevant comparison to our method is attempting to stylize the image without using a procedure to estimate derivatives with respect to geometry (instead only with respect to color), and we provide the results attained by doing so in a side-by-side comparison (see figure 2). \n\nFinally, our application of approximately computing convex hulls is not an application that has been seriously examined in the literature, to our knowledge. We display out-of-sample examples from our data (figure 4) and report out-of-sample accuracy on the intersection over union objective. We could devise yet another method to approach the problem, and then attempt to compare two novel methods, but we don\u2019t feel that would helpfully contextualize the results given this problem has not been approached previously in the literature to our knowledge. \n\nYou ask a great question about non-uniform sampling. We have not explicitly attempted to work out the details of the scenario you mention. Speculatively, if one can push the fibers through the inverse function (possibly representing the fibers as parametric curves), it should still be possible to apply our implicit function formulation to estimate the integrals. This is an interesting use-case that should probably be the focus of a follow-up study. Happy to hear your thoughts or speculations on this as well!"

My main concern is that the generality of the proposed method is still not overwhelmingly clear.  For example, differentiable rendering (i.e. MC path tracing) is considered to be out of the scope of the paper (which is not inherently a problem), but it brings into question whether this method would actually generalize to such real, well-established applications for MC integration.\n\nSpecifically regarding the question of inverse-transform sampling, in my opinion this would be a very valuable section to include in the paper, as sampling non-uniformly over a domain surely opens the doors to additional applications, and would further make the case for the generality of the proposed method.\n\nI will maintain my original score."

As you mentioned, one previous reviewer was concerned about the level of precision offered in our technical arguments. In this revision, we treat an argument for correctness using measure theory directly and cite relevant/similar results from integral geometry. We felt concerned that this argument might not be as generous/clear as our previous one, so we also cleaned-up and simplified an argument for correctness using just calculus, which is in the appendix. The writing overall was picked through and re-written throughout to improve clarity, and we feel the paper reads much better this time around. \n2. Absolutely, we will include this plot: thanks for this suggestion."

Sampling line segments rather than points produces an empirical estimate that is continuous and (almost-everywhere) differentiable. Assuming the discontinuous integrand is parametrized by a superposition of indicator functions parametrized by implicit level sets, the derivatives of integrals over individual line segments can be calculated by differentiating the implicit functions. The method is demonstrated on several problems: 2D inverse rendering, topology optimization, and convex hull approximation."

The authors point out the long history of this idea in mathematics, dating back at least to the Crofton formula, Radon transform, and integral geometry. These are ideas that I think have yet to be fully exploited in neural rendering/neural fields/inverse graphics. One related work I would suggest citing is the following, which also involves the evaluation of neural fields along lines rather than points:\n\n- V. Sitzmann, S. Rezchikov, B. Freeman, J.

However, the choice to represent the indicator function on a grid seems puzzling when a great advantage of a sampling-based estimator coupled to automatic differentiation is the flexibility of the underlying representation.\n\nThe convex hull application seems the weakest to me. It looks like the generated approximate hulls are not even convex, nor do they contain all the points, so it is unclear how they would be useful in downstream applications such as collision detection. In any case, classical convex hull algorithms in low dimension are plenty fast and come with correctness and performance guarantees. Accordingly, any proposal to replace them with a learned \"oracle\" must clear a very high bar.\n\nMore generally, only a few results are shown, and the numerical comparisons in the topology optimization case only show a marginal improvement in objective function. It would be good to include at least a few more test cases and comparisons."

But if one is going to use such a representation, why not just use a continuous implicit function directly. For example, rather than using a superposition of level sets of SIREN networks, one could just use SIREN directly. In what application domains do you see this sort of representation being uniquely advantageous?\n- The authors repeatedly emphasize that the method is only applicable in low dimension. Why is this? What would it take to extend the method to general dimension? What about to spaces other than $\\mathbb{R}^n$?\n- What are the island artifacts in the topology-optimized solutions using fiber sampling? Why do they appear?\n- What would it take to extend the method to more general geometry representations for topology optimization rather than just grid discretization?"

                        "value": "Thank you for your helpful feedback. We sincerely appreciate the time and effort you\u2019ve taken to read the work closely and provide valuable feedback. As we understand it, you\u2019re chiefly concerned about the experimental evaluations. We\u2019ll try to provide some context around the experiments and address your specific questions. \n\nAt a broad level, we feel that the contribution of this work is a novel method for solving problems which were not previously generically solvable. We do not take the position that our performance on any of the applications surveyed is superior to state of the art. Our position is that performance is clearly comparable, even without domain-specific adaptations to the core method.  \n\nAll that said, we address your specific concerns in the following paragraphs. \n\n**********************************Image Stylization**********************************\n\nYou write that \u201cit seems clear that the image stylization is meant to stand in for inverse graphics more generally\u201d. As follows from the paragraph above: we do not mean to imply or claim that the image stylization application we present is meant to \u201cstand in for inverse graphics more generally.\u201d We chose image stylization in particular (as a specific sub-problem within inverse graphics) because the objective function contains an integral with a parametric discontinuity; this makes it an appropriate target for fiber Monte Carlo.\n\n**************************Topology Optimization************************** \n\nIt is true that the geometry representation is still a grid. In general, level-set topology optimization is known to be very difficult to do stably. Using flexible representations, although in theory possible, is difficult to get right. Existing literature has focused on grid representations, so to align with existing work we chose to stick with the grid representation. Also of note is that topology optimization is a large field with a vast literature, and we do not expect to show that our method is the \u201cbest\u201d out of the box on two examples; the marginal improvement in objective function is possibly only incidental. A rigorous evaluation of fiber sampling with topology optimization potentially deserves its own paper; here we simply present that it performs reasonably out of the box compared to a standard approach from the literature, since the focus of this work is about explicating the fundamental method of fiber sampling.\n\n************************************************Approximate Convex Hulls************************************************\n\nVisually, we see that in certain portions of the image it is not immediately apparent that the approximate hulls are convex sets (the pale coloring makes it hard to distinguish); this is useful feedback for regenerating finalized figures with a better color set. Rest assured that this is a plotting artifact: the approximate hulls are convex by construction. We take the intersection of a finite set of half-spaces. Since a halfspace is a convex set, and the intersection of a finite set of convex sets is itself convex, the approximate hulls are convex (for any value of the parameter). \n\nIt is true that our approximate hulls are not supersets of the true convex hulls (i.e., they do not contain all the points, as you mention). This why we use the term \u201capproximate\u201d convex hulls (necessarily convex sets which are not necessarily equal to the convex hull). We do not propose the replacement of classical convex hull algorithms, and completely agree that such a proposal would require significantly more comprehensive analysis (in fact, this is an immense area of study and could be the subject of an entire paper)."

However, the fact that the hypernetwork predicts intersections of half-spaces is only alluded to in both the paper and the supplementary material. It would be good to make this explicit. The text only specifies that \"[t]he forward model $h : \\mathbb{R}^m \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times d} \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$ is a \u2018hypernetwork\u2019 in the sense that it produces a $p$-vector of parameters associated with an implicit function.\" Later it is mentioned that half-spaces are sampled, but it is unclear from the text how they are used.\n\nMoreover, it is still unclear to me where an approximate convex hull algorithm can be useful if it is not guaranteed to be conservative. E.g., in collision detection, false positives are OK as they can later be resolved, but false negatives are not.\n\n**Topology Optimization:** This seems like the most compelling application, and it would be great to expand on this a bit more, perhaps by cutting or reworking the approximate convex hull section."
