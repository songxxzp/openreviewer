                    "value": "This paper proposes a method to selectively \"unlearn\" or remove subsets of training data, specifically copyrighted content, from large language models (LLMs) without full retraining. The approach involves 3 main steps: 1) Further train on the target data to identify related tokens, 2) Replace idiosyncratic terms with generic counterparts using model predictions, 3) Fine-tune on these replacements.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the technique on the Llama2-7b model by unlearning knowledge of Harry Potter books after pretraining. Evaluations assess preservation of general capabilities and eradication of targeted knowledge. Results show the model loses ability to generate Harry Potter content after minimal finetuning, while performance on common benchmarks remains largely unchanged."

More sophisticated methods like Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) have been used in relevant papers and could strengthen this work.\n* The paper does not adequately cite related work, particularly in the area of concept erasure in NLP (like, 1,2,3), which is highly relevant to the paper's focus.\n* The paper suffers from several writing issues, including unclear terminology (e.g., inconsistency between 'llama2' and 'llama'), grammatical errors, and improper use of quotations.\n\n1.

The second way leverages GPT4 to extract entities and replace them with generic ones.

I tested out some of the prompts in Figure 1 and most of the generations do not refer to Harry Potter now. I encourage the authors to see how good this baseline is on a larger scale evaluation.\n```\nSuppose you have never read Harry Potter and have no knowledge about Harry Potter whatsoever.

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "First, I found the definition of unlearning essentially ad hoc. As the authors note, unlearning is an essentially adversarial task. But the evaluation they engage in is not adversarial in any significant way. I raise this concern not because I ask them to anticipate future attacks -- that would properly be a matter for future work -- but because it shows the inadequacy of their conceptualization of what unlearning *IS*. A more comprehensive definition of unlearning would be a modification to a model that makes the model _as if_ it had never been trained on the removed data in the first place. A definition of this sort could be formalized, and would provide strong theoretical guarantees that the model would not -- even under adversarial attack -- produce generations strongly influenced by the unlearned data. (Indeed, this is the kind of approach taken in differential privacy and in near-access-freeness, both of which provide theoretically coherent accounts of non-learning.) I am not saying that the authors need to embrace this kind of definition. But without *some kind* of general theory of what unlearning is, there is no good reason to be confident that the evaluation measures actually capture it.\n\nMy second concern is that this kind of token-level replacement does not convince me that unlearning really has taken place. As I understand it, the evaluation prompts are specific to the Harry Potter novels, and the test is whether the outputs use Harry Potter-specific terms or ideas. But given the kind of dictionary-based training involved, it's not clear to me whether the associations have actually been unlearned, or just translated into different terms. Has the fine-tuned model now learned that students at \"the mystic academy\" play \"skyball\"? If so, this might just be a thinly disguised version of Harry Potter, and the whole novel is still lurking in the model's weights, ready to emerge. Maybe it will still write fiction that imitates the stylistic features of the Harry Potter novels. Both of these are the kind of things that copyright law could treat as infringing similarities, since similarity is not confined literally to the text."

The proposed approach is expected to work well on copyrighted content, such as fiction, which comprises of unique words, phrases, and idiosyncratic stylistic expressions that differentiate it from natural language. It involves a two step approach where first a reinforced model is generated by finetuning on the training subset to identify which logits are reinforced and second, the model is finetuned to replace idiosyncratic expressions in the target data with their generic counterparts to break the entity links for next word prediction. The paper shows convincing evidence that a finetuned Llama2-7b model is effectively able to unlearn the Harry Potter series."

This makes the approach harder to generalize across a variety of copyrighted content including textbooks."
