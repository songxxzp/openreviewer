                    "value": "This paper studies the convergence properties of q-replicator dynamics in continuous-time potential games. Potential games are a special class of general-sum games in which player utilities can be represented by a potential function. q-replicator dynamics are a class of learning dynamics which take a hyperparameter $q$ as input. If $q=0$ gradient descent is recovered, if $q=1$ replicator dynamics are recovered, and if $q=2$ log-barrier dynamics are recovered. The authors show that q-replicator dynamics converge pointwise to Nash equilibria in a subclass of potential games called Perfectly-Regular Potential Games (PRPGs), which capture almost all finite potential games. \n\nHaving established this result, the authors are interested in analyzing which equilibria are converged to when all players in a game employ q-replicator dynamics. Their main metric of performance is the average price of anarchy (APoA), which measures the price of anarchy, on average, with respect to a uniformly random initialization of the q-replicator dynamics. The authors' main theoretical contributions come in the setting of 2-by-2 PRPGs. In particular, they find that the APoA of running gradient descent is higher than the APoA of running replicator dynamics in 2-by-2 PRPGs if and only if the payoff-dominant equilibrium is also risk-dominant. Here, the \"payoff-dominant\" equilibrium refers to the equilibrium with the highest utility, and an equilibrium is \"risk-dominant\" if it is unilaterally optimal against the uniform distribution of the rest of the agents. \n\nThe authors compliment their theoretical results in 2-by-2 PRPGs with numerical simulations in higher dimensions. They find that, in line with their theoretical results in 2-by-2 games, gradient descent outperforms the replicator dynamics in all diagonal games (i.e. games in which the only non-zero elements of the payoff matrix are along the diagonal). Throughout the submission, the authors provide proof sketches and intuition for their results."

Additionally, obtaining results in this area has traditionally been challenging. While the authors restrict themselves to a subclass of two-by-two potential games, the authors' results are novel and their analysis helps shed some light on this important issue by comparing the convergence properties of gradient descent and replicator dynamics, two canonical algorithms for learning in games. I found the paper to be well-written, and I appreciated the authors' efforts to provide intuition for their results and why they cannot be easily extended beyond the two-by-two setting they consider. The numerical simulations in settings beyond two-by-two games are also a strength, as they help shed light on this problem in a more general setting, despite the issues with extending the authors' theoretical results."

                        "value": "We are delighted to hear that you found our paper to be well-written, and that you appreciated our efforts to provide intuition for our results!\n\n- **Question 1:** *Why focus on metrics which measure performance with respect to random initialization instead of other methods of initialization, e.g. initializing to the uniform distribution over actions as is canonical in the literature on learning in games?*\n\n- **Response**: \n    - Firstly, as we show, starting from the uniform distribution, the dynamics are guaranteed to converge to the risk-dominant equilibrium which, unless it coincides with the payoff dominant equilibrium, can be detrimental to social welfare. Thus, the convention to start at the uniform distribution is, in fact, a restriction rather than a desirable norm.\n    - Secondly, we believe that our quantification of uncertainty is more appropriate for our purpose. Specifically, if we assume that all the agents always start from a uniform distribution that seems to convey a belief from the perspective of the experimenter that the related individuals do not have any inherent biases for choosing one action versus another. But in practice there could be a lot of conscious or unconscious biases at play; for instance, due to how the order with which the actions are presented to the participants, or the names given to the actions, etc. Thus, we believe that it is more appropriate to encode a type of epistemic uncertainty that means that we are not being certain about what the relevant probability distribution is (see also the Wikipedia discussion [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)). *Critically, this was also the choice in the original paper by Panageas and Piliouras that we are building upon.*\n    - Finally, perhaps it is also useful to point out why our results are robust to the choice of the initial measure which does not have to be exactly the uniform measure, i.e., the Lebesgue measure. Specifically, we could easily allow for the measure of each set to be within some fixed multiplicative constant, $\\gamma$, of its true Lebesgue measure, in which case, the probability of converging to the good/bad equilibrium could only be amplified/reduced by at most $\\gamma$. Combining this with the analysis for the uniform case, one could then derive such APoA bounds, but now they would be parametric on $\\gamma$.\n- **Question 2:** *Do you have any insights on how your results would carry over to the discrete-time setting?*\n- **Response:** The details of the analysis would depend on the exact choice of discretization, e.g., whether you discretize replicator as Multiplicative Weight Updates (i.e. the Euler method in the dual space), or via a discretization in the primal space, or e.g., via discrete replicator dynamics also known as linear MWU). Generally there could be shuttle differences in the behavior of a given orbit given the exact choice of discretization (see [1]). Such subtleties aside, a good rule of thumb is that by choosing small enough step-size the regions of attraction of the discretized systems can effectively become indistinguishable from the continuous-time one. Pushing such approaches towards understanding larger steps sizes, which could destabilize some discretizations into chaos (again see [1]) is an interesting direction but beyond the scope of this work.\n    1.

However, these ``Price of Anarchy\" (PoA) bounds hold in a worst-case sense, and need not faithfully represent the real-world performance of concrete dynamics. This work considers the average-case PoA (APoA) of a large family of dynamics, namely Q-Replicator dynamics, in potential games. The main contributions of this work are threefold: first, it is shown that almost all potential games are such that Q-replicator dynamics initialized on any interior point converges to a (finite set of) Nash equilibrium. In particular, this makes average-case notions of PoA almost always well-defined. In the case of 2x2 games, this paper provides a complete characterization of the regions of attraction for different equilibria. The main applications are to exactly characterize in which 2x2 games gradient descent dynamics has a better APoA than replicator dynamics, and moreover, bound the APoA of gradient descent when the payoff- and risk-dominant Nash equilibria coincide. Finally, preliminary empirical evidence is given to suggest that certain generalizations of the results are possible."

This would also help convince the reader of the novelty of these results.\n\n---As mentioned above, the main weakness is that the concrete theoretical results on APoA are localized to 2x2 games. It isn't entirely clear what an appropriate generalization would look like with more agents and larger action spaces, and of course, one imagines that the technical analysis quickly becomes intractable. But progress on these questions has to start somewhere and my current impression is that this paper indeed takes steps towards these aims that would be of value to the community."

This would also help convince the reader of the novelty of these results... A bit more discussion about the technical differences with prior work (i.e. that of Panageas and Piliouras [PP]).* \n\n**Response:** We will be happy to expand a bit further on our technical differences between our paper and the precursor one by Panageas and Piliouras 2016 ([PP16]). What [PP16] show is that the APoA is effectively well-posed for all linear congestion games using a rather elaborate but hard to generalize argument. This argument critically relies on the exact definition of replicator dynamics as well as on the linearity of costs. Instead, our approach follows a different proof technique that allows us to generalize along both the game and the learning dynamics dimensions. We can break down our technical differences in three parts. \n    \n- **Well-posedness of APoA:** Our first technical contribution is that our analysis allows for APoA to be effectively well-defined and applied to all generic potential games for all q-replicator dynamics (Section 3). The related techniques have no analogue in the original paper and leverage recent advances in the theory of potential games (Swenson 2020). This is the convergence result of Theorem 3.1. Such approaches that target generic (versus all games) within some class of games are commonly used in game dynamics (see e.g. Theorem 3.3 in [1]) or the quasi-strict genericity assumption in [2-5].\n    \n    1.

Our approach extends the invariant function technique, see Lemma 4.7, which enables the proof of Theorem 4.6. Despite the thematic similarity between this part and the related part in the [PP] paper, there is also a lot of new technical content on the exact nature of the separatrix and how it affects the dynamics. For instance, one such result is captured in Lemma B.3 (supplementary) which concerns the curvature of the separatrix. Such results inform our intuition on the reasons why our main results hold (for instance Theorem 4.6) and we believe that they can enable a lot of interesting follow-up work. We also believe that our proof technique is flexible enough to be applied on different classes of learning dynamics. Other similar papers that generalize findings from replicator like dynamics to other related dynamics are: from [1] to [2] and from [3] to [4].\n    \n    1. Piliouras, Georgios, and Jeff S.

No such section or software package was made available in [PP].\n\nWe hope that the above clarify the technical differences between the two papers.
