Specifically, this paper first provides a concrete example, showing that the optimization process of vanilla MGDA may stuck in weakly Pareto points. Enlightened by this observation, this paper proposes to partition the model parameters into different groups according to three partitioning rules, which are then fed to the min-norm solver separately. A case study on personalized federated learning shows the effectiveness of the RP-MGDA's achieving strict Pareto solutions, which is also supported by empirical results."

Based on this observation, this work proposes a refined partition approach that divides the variables $x$ into different groups based on the variable structure, and then separately optimizes them with MGDA during the optimization process. The experiment shows that RP-MGDA can find Pareto optimal solutions for some synthetic toy problems while the original MGDA cannot."

                    "value": "**1. Assumption on Completely Known Variable Structure**\n\nThe original MGDA only depends on the standard first-order oracle for multi-objective optimization, where it can query a variable $x$ and then receive $(f_i(x), \\nabla f_i(x))$ pairs for all objective functions. The variable structure is a black-box for MGDA. In contrast, the proposed method has a much stronger assumption that all the variable relations among $x$ for all objective functions are completely known. This important difference is not properly discussed in the paper.\n\n**2. Novelty over the Current Practice**\n\nAlthough the original MGDA works on the whole variables, a simple **separately optimizing the variables specific to each objective, and then tackling the rest variables shared by more than one objective with MGDA** approach is already widely used in practice. For example, see the seminal work [1] and many follow-ups in the recent years.\n\nThe proposed RP-MGDA has two rules to merge the variables, namely, the 'dense block' merge and the 'loop' merge. However, it seems that all the toy examples (section 5.1 and section 5.2) as well as the personalized federated learning example (section A.2) all just simply optimize the objective-specific variable separately, and then optimize the rest variables together.\n\nWhat is the novelty and advantage of the proposed RP approach over the current practical approach? Can you give an example that how the RP-MGDA will lead to a different grouping? Is there any real-world application to demonstrate and support this setting?\n\n**3. Experiments on Real-World Applications**\n\nThis work only conducts experiments on a few toy problems, and the personalized federated learning example (in the Appendix) is an illustrative prototype without experiment.\n\nAs a methodology paper, I expect it should have comprehensive experiments on real-world applications that the audience of the ICLR community will be interested in, like those in [1-5]. The current theoretical papers usually also have experiments on large-scale real-world applications like deep multi-task learning [6, 7]."
