                    "value": "This work is based on a whole series of misconceptions. In the following, I restrict myself to a few central points. Actually, my list is still quite long.\n\nThe argumentation of this paper is based on the presumption that ESs promise robust solutions. I have been active in ES research for more than 10 years, and I don't remember anyone making such a promise.\n\nAdding robustness to an optimization method is a very basic research topic in optimization. At its core, it is unrelated to machine learning. Therefore, the method should be evaluated on benchmark problems suited for assessing robustness of optimization. Evaluating on complex RL tasks does not allow me to judge whether the method achieves its goals, since the challenges of these problems are largely unknown. I would first like to see a clear-cut benchmark problem with robust optimization as the main challenge. Sphere and Rastrigin don't qualify for that goal. I really wonder why they were included.\n\nCiting Wierstra et al. (2014) for the introduction of a population of fixed size and a Gaussian search distribution reveals that the authors' knowledge of evolution strategies (and their history) is shallow. That's a standard model since at least 40 years!\n\nThe subsequent formulas make things much worse. What is $\\theta$? First, it refers to the vector of all distribution parameters, and that's also the meaning in the cited paper. From the next sentence onwards, $\\theta$ is only the distribution mean, while the standard deviation (step size) \\sigma is listed separately. The full covariance matrix considered by Wierstra is not even mentioned. The whole point of the NES method presented by Wierstra is to unify these parameters. What is presented here is the trimmed version sold by Salimans as an ES, although it does not even include the most basic of its mechanisms, namely step size adaptation. The manuscript does not even cite the OpenAI paper for this decisive difference. What happens here is that the term \"ES\" is misused to represent a stochastic gradient estimator from Gaussian samples which is then fed into ADAM. The evolutionary optimization community has a well-established (50 years old) definition of an ES. This method does not qualify.\n\nThe present paper takes a detour through the world of energy-based models to justify something trivial, namely adding noise to the distribution mean. I see no point in doing so, since the effect is very similar to using a larger $\\sigma$. A so-called \"ES\" with fixed step size does not converge to a Dirac peak. Actually, it does not converge at all in the usual sense, but it approaches the limit distribution of a Markov chain that usually (and hopefully) covers high quality solutions without actually identifying them more precisely. Then why should one need to add noise to the mean in order to achieve the stated goal of the paper? One could simply increase $\\sigma$ to get essentially the same effect.\n\nThe fitness plots for Sphere and Rastrigin do not use a log scale. This way, they are completely meaningless. That's entirely unacceptable and ignorant of the standards of the field. Also, the curves for CMA-ES clearly reveal a problem. Here, CMA-ES is slower than random search! In reality, CMA-ES is extremely efficient on Sphere. The only explanation might be that it is initialized with an unsuitable step size in combination with a high problem dimension. It is also compelling that the curves for Sphere and Rastrigin look identical. That should really not be that case. I wonder how one can publish such results without being a bit more skeptical. The authors neither state the problem dimension, nor the initialization, and not even the computational budget. However, one thing is crystal clear: no algorithm in the world can outperform CMA-ES on sphere by a large margin, because it is actually quite efficient on that problem. Since the code is not included as a supplement, I am unable to give a more precise analysis. I can however conclude with certainty that the results cannot be trusted. They are as fishy as they can get.\n\nFrom the appendix: \"Finally, we decay both the learning rate \\alpha and the step-size \\sigma as evolution progresses; indeed, after preliminary experiments, we found that decaying both of them improved convergence quality and time over no decay or decaying only one of the two.\" I strongly recommend the authors to read (a translation of) the 1973 Rechenberg paper they cite. It is all about adapting \\sigma properly, and when implemented (and using fitness shaping as discussed in the appendix), there will be no need for any adaptation schedule, which truly adds lots of hidden hyperparameters.\n\nFurther problems:\n\nThe \"Separable Natural Evolution Strategy (sNES)\" was not published by Wierstra (as claimed), but by Cuccu and Gomez:\nCuccu, Giuseppe, and Faustino Gomez. \"Block diagonal natural evolution strategies.\" International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2012.\n\nIn the experiments, CMA-ES is applied to networks with more than 4000 weights. With that problem dimension, it takes extremely long to adapt the covariance matrix. In essence, it will not happen within the given budget. It would be much more sensible to apply a low-rank approximation method like here:\nLoshchilov, Ilya. \"A computationally efficient limited memory CMA-ES for large scale optimization.\" Proceedings of the 2014 Annual Conference on Genetic and Evolutionary Computation. 2014.\n\nSection numbering: 2 -> 2.0.1 -> 2.1 ... something is wrong here.\n\nThe paper contains unresolved LaTeX references (\"??\")."

However, such an effect is naturally included in the original update of the mean vector in ES as as it takes the weighted average of the candidate solutions, which results in the expected gradient with an additional gaussian noise scaled by the step-size. Therefore, I do not see any technical advantage of the proposed algorithm.\n\nThe experimental results are rather suspicious. On Sphere and Rastrigin, the proposed approaches and some other approaches reached better solutions already at the beginning than the solutions that CMA-ES reached at the end of the search. It is definitely due to unfair and invalid initialization and hyper-parameter settings. \n\nThe proposed approach is proposed as a general purpose black-box optimization algorithm. For such a purpose, the numerical evaluation is definitely not sufficient. Consider to use COCO (BBOB) framework to evaluate the algorithm and to compare with other baselines.\n\nThe robustness is evaluated in the paper, but if the robustness is an important point, there are many approaches to obtain robust policies. The authors should compare the proposed approach to these approaches. \n\nThe explanations of ES are wrong. In Wierstra 2014, they parameterized both the mean and the covariance of the gaussian distribution, not just the mean. Algorithm 1 is wrong. The epsilon should follow N(0, 1), not N(0, sigma^2)."

However, the underlying issue appears more akin to an optimization challenge where a broader exploration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) techniques should be included and compared in both the discussion and experiments. Notably, the novelty seems somewhat limited, given the extensive prior research on the application and enhancement of SGD in policy optimization, as demonstrated in works such as [1][2][3]. Aside from these points, there is a need for a thorough reorganization of the content, as I am finding it difficult to discern the specific problem that ES aims to address. Please refer to my detailed comments below for further clarification.\n\n1. I believe the author's intent is to introduce a policy search algorithm within the context of reinforcement learning tasks. Nevertheless, for individuals who lack familiarity with this subject matter, grasping the connection between ES (Evolution Strategies) and the policy search algorithm can be challenging when perusing the introduction.\n2. The paper overlooks citing the pioneering work on Energy-Based Models (EBMs) utilizing a neural network as the energy function in the generative model, as presented in [4].\n3. The section number 2.0.1 should be 2.1.\n4. The author claims that \"The energy is a smoothing of the fitness function that makes the fitness landscape smoother and hence better behaved\". Is there any evidence or experiments can demonstrate this?\n5.

                    "value": "1. What is population refer to in the model? Is it a reward function in RL problems?\n2. Could the author explain what problem the ES try to solve? Is there any realistic example?\n3. In 2.1, what does it mean for \"$\\theta$ is $\\theta$\"?\n4. Is $x$ also an variable in Eq(3) for the numerator?\n5. Why the solution space follows Gaussian distribution?\n6. What does the introduced drift term stands for in the proposed framework. Is it used only for a stochastic gradient descent method?\n7. Could the proposed method be used in discrete space?"
