Why is the use of BCE loss a meaningful categorization?\n- In Sec. 1 - paragraph 4, the paper claims that using MSE instead of BCE lacks \"flexibility.\" What is the definition of flexibility in this context, and why is BCE considered better than MSE for this purpose?\n- In Sec. 1 - paragraph 5, the paper suddenly discusses \"seen-unseen pairs.\" Why is this concept important, and how is it related to the problem? This relationship is not explained.\n- In Sec. 2 - paragraph 2, the paper claims that previous works do not consider optimization at the feature level. However, they also jointly optimize the feature and classifier.\n- In Sec. 2 - paragraph 3, the paper claims that OpenCon is incapable of sustaining \"continuous optimization\" of representations. What is continuous optimization, and why can't OpenCon achieve this?\n- In Sec. 3.2, why should one consider BCE-based methods? BCE-based methods are just one specific approach by Cao et al. and some follow-ups. Eq. (1) does not represent all OWSSL methods.\n- ...but not limited to.\n\nAside from the unclear overall logic, the sentences are significantly unpolished. Many grammatical errors make it difficult to grasp the meaning.\nThere are also typos and inconsistent use of terminologies. For example, \"L\" in the abstract, uncapitalized \"all\" in Table 1, unformatted \"seen/unseen\" in Sec. 3.1, and \"OWSSL\" is not defined in Sec. 3.2.\n\n\n---\n**Proposed method is merely a combination of existing techniques**\n\n\nThe motivation if the method is (1) enhance the separability of known class features and (2) prevent the collapse of unknown class features.\nThe paper employs SupCon (and a NN variant) for (1) and SelfCon for (2).\n\nThere are two issues here:\n1. It is obvious that contrastive learning would enhance performance. In fact, this benefit for OWSSL has already been demonstrated in prior works, such as GCD [1] and OpenCon [2].\n2. The addition of Sup/SelfCon generally enhances the models, not only for the OWSSL problem. To verify this, one can apply the proposed method to (1) the standard SSL setup and (2) other SSL methods. I believe it will also result in improvements in those cases, suggesting that the method does not exclusively target the OWSSL issue.\n\n---\n**Missing important baselines**\n\nThe paper omits a comparison with a highly related work, OpenCon [2]. The reasons provided in the paper for avoiding this comparison are not convincing. Additionally, GCD [1] is highly relevant to the paper but is missing from the comparison.\nFurthermore, the paper does not include a comparison with papers published in 2023, such as RoPAWS [3], which also employs contrastive learning for SSL. Not only them, but there is also a long list of related works.\nThe OpenCon paper has 6 pages of references, in contrast to this paper with only 2 pages. Checking them would enable a more comprehensive context in the related work section, thereby making the paper more self-contained.\n\n[1] Generalized Category Discovery, CVPR'22.\\\n[2] OpenCon: Open-world Contrastive Learning.

We sincerely appreciate your constructive comments.\n\n## R 4.1 In Sec. 1 - paragraph 3,  why is the use of BCE loss a meaningful categorization?\n\nWe figure out that the similarity function is honed by directly computing the similarity of all sample pairs and their logits counterparts in other methods. However, not all the similarity of sample pairs can  efficiently guide the subsequent learning process since unseen class samples are prone to be mislabeled as seen classes in initial training phases. That's why BCE-based is important and could be regarded as a meaningful categorization.\n\n## R 4.2 paragraph 4, the paper claims that using MSE instead of BCE lacks \"flexibility.\" ...\n\nIn the original version we did not elucidate this issue clearly, in fact, it is the difference in the way sample pairs are selected that defines the different categories of methods, and the BCE-based methods are based on the nearest-neighbor feature selection which is more flexible. So we say that the BCE-based methods are flexible, not that the BCE is superior to the MSE.\n\n## R 4.3 In Sec. 1 - In Sec. 1 - paragraph 5, the paper suddenly discusses \"seen-unseen pairs.\" Why is this concept important, and how is it related to the problem? This relationship is not explained.\n\nBecause these methods utilizes pairwise clustering in order to give the model the ability to classify seen and unseen classes, the quality of the sample pairs is very important, so we have to pay attention to the seen-unseen sample pairs.\n\n## R 4.4 In Sec. 2 - paragraph 2, the paper claims that previous works do not consider optimization at the feature level. However, they also jointly optimize the feature and classifier.\n\nYou may refer to our answer to reviewer fiFv  R 3.1.\n\n## R 4.5 In Sec. 2 - paragraph 3, the paper claims that OpenCon is incapable of sustaining \"continuous optimization\" of representations. What is continuous optimization, and why can't OpenCon achieve this?\n\nWe give a detailed explanation in our latest PDF.\n\n## R 4.6 In Sec. 3.2, why should one consider BCE-based methods? BCE-based methods are just one specific approach by Cao et al. and some follow-ups. Eq. (1) does not represent all OWSSL methods.\n\nIn open world semi-supervised learning problem, high quality chosen samples are utilized to give the model the ability to classify both seen and unseen classes. The strategy for selecting the samples is critical. And BCE-based methods are more suitable for choosing high quality samples since these methods can choose samples pairs in a more flexible way as explained before.\n\n## R 4.6  Aside from the unclear overall logic, the sentences are significantly unpolished. Many grammatical errors make it difficult to grasp the meaning. There are also typos and inconsistent use of terminologies. For example, \"L\" in the abstract, uncapitalized \"all\" in Table 1, unformatted \"seen/unseen\" in Sec. 3.1, and \"OWSSL\" is not defined in Sec. 3.2.\n\nWe have made the appropriate changes in the paper.\n\n## R 4.7 The motivation if the method is (1) enhance the separability of known class features and (2) prevent the collapse of unknown class features. The paper employs SupCon (and a NN variant) for (1) and SelfCon for (2).\n\nYou may refer to our answer to reviewer fiFv  R 3.1.\n\n## R 4.8 Missing important baselines such as GCD , OpenCon and RoPAWS.\n\nWe have compared Opencon in Table 1, where the combination of NACH and control outperforms Opencon.\nwe have added GCD to the comparison methods.\nRoPAWS is not an OWSSL algorithm, and its goal is not to classify both seen and unseen classes, but rather to better ensure the correctness of seen categories when unlabeled data has unseen classes, so we will not discuss it.\n\nThe results of additional experiments are as follows\uff0c we evaluate all the methods on CIFAR-100 dataset.\n|  CIFAR100  |seen acc  |unseen acc  |all acc |\n|----  |----  |----  |----  |\n| ORCA  | 66.9 |43.0 |48.1\t|\n| ORCA+CONTROL  | 67.6 |44.8 |49.6\t|\n| Opencon |69.3 |47.6 |51.8\t|\n| GCD  | 69.8 |42.9 |46.5\t|\n| NACH  | 68.7 |47.0 |52.1\t|\n| NACH+CONTORL | 70.1 |48.5 |53.0\t|\n\nWe can see that, the combination of NACH and our proposed CONTROL still gives the best results among all the compared methods.\n\n\n## R 4.9 Does the proposed method also improve non-OW SSL benchmarks and other OWSSL methods?\n\nWe illustrate this with Fixmatch, a representative deep semi-supervised learning algorithm with 250 labeled data on cifar10 dataset using wideresnet-28-2 as backbone, in conjunction with L_simALL and L_supSeen in our proposed framework, with the following results:\n|      |original  |with CONTROL |\n|----  |----  |----  |\n|ACC   |95.13      |95.28  |\n\nWe can see that even doing feature-level optimization based on the semi-supervised learning algorithm in the traditional setup results in a performance gain, but they are far less than in OWSS setup, which demonstrates the reasonableness of our proposed combination of CONTROL and OWSSL algorithms."

We point out this key issue and validate our viewpoint with extensive experiments.

However, the paper does not provide details on the values chosen for these parameters, nor does it discuss their sensitivity or robustness through experiments.\n\nAbout the proof provided in Section 4.1, we illustrate the importance of feature-level optimization by whether the optimal classifier learned in the presence of mispairing is consistent with the ideal optimal classifier, Eq. 3 illustrates inconsistency at logits level and Eq. 4 illustrates consistency at feature level.\n\nAs mentioned before all the three losses are proposed in the feature-level optimization which have theoretically guaranteed to get a performance gain.\n\nAbout the choice of parameters, the results of additional stripping experiments are as follows\uff0c we evaluate our methods on CIFAR-100 dataset with different parameters.\n|  lambda1   | lambda2  |lambda3  |seen acc  |unseen acc  |all acc |\n|  ----  | ----  |----  |----  |----  |----  |\n| 0.1  | 0.1 |0.1 |74.0\t|47.9\t|54.7|\n| 0.1  | 0.1 |0.3 |74.1\t|49.4|\t55.2|\n| 0.1  | 0.1 |0.5 |74.1\t|50.8|\t56.5|\n| 0.3  | 0.1 |0.1 |74.2\t|51.1|\t57.0|\n| 0.3  | 0.1 |0.3 |74.1\t|50.6|\t57.8|\n| 0.3  | 0.1 |0.5 |74.2\t|49.5|\t55.4|\n| 0.5  | 0.1 |0.1 |74.0\t|48.1|\t54.9|\n| 0.5  | 0.1 |0.3 |74.1 |53.3|\t58.0|\n| 0.5  | 0.1 |0.5 |74.0\t|53.1|\t58.0|\n\nThe values 0.5 0.1 0.3 that we report in the paper are optimal for the parameter combinations.\n\n## R 3.3 Reproducibility Concerns: The absence of a reproducibility statement raises doubts about the possibility of replicating the claimed state-of-the-art performance.\n\nAll the results are reproducible, and we'll make our code publicly available upon acceptance.\n\n## R 3.4 In Section 3.1, shouldn't C_seen be defined as C_L instead of C_seen = C_L cap C_U\n \nYes, the two are equivalent in our setup, and we've made changes for better understanding by the reader."

The paper proposes to adapt various loss terms used in other SSL tasks. In addition, the paper focuses on performing SSL on the feature-level representations, where the author provides theoretical analysis to argue the superiority of contrastive loss over conventional BCE loss. Experiments combine the proposed CONTROL technique with two existing baselines and show noticeable improvements in the accuracy of both seen and unseen classes."

The ablation study of CONTROL on CIFAR-100 also justifies the motivation for different introduced loss terms.

                    "value": "- The main weakness of the paper lies in the narration of the paper, which makes it hard for a broader audience to capture the contributions of the paper. In many parts of the paper, the writing is focused on *what* is done but not *why* this is better than alternative methods. This makes the paper seem like a technical report rather than a research paper. A good paper is expected to provide insights to other researchers on 'why' the method works and how it can help with future research and real-world applications. This issue is particularly concerning in the introduction section, which is supposed to provide readers with high-level motivation of the methods. However, in the introduction, the third paragraph lists BCE-based methods and non-BCE methods without discussing when each of the methods is preferred and why each is motivated. Though the fourth paragraph attempts to argue for the superiority of BCE-based methods for open-world SSL, it again does not talk about high-level motivation for BCE-based methods. Instead, it directly dives into the details of similarity functions and talks about 'pulling closer sample pairs'. Such a discussion misses out a lot of context and causes confusion on what are the actual contribution of the paper. Also, the highlighted question in the introduction section seems to overlap greatly with the contribution with OpenCon. The only difference is that the authors claim CONTROl is 'unified' and 'open-world', but there is no further analysis on these two factors and how CONTROL differentiates itself from OpenCon.\n- The paper seems to miss out on the addition of CONTROL to an important baseline OpenCon. OpenCon also proposes to apply contrastive learning for SSL. The paper argues that OpenCon is 'incapable of sustaining continuous optimization of representations during the process of semi-supervised learning'. However, from the final table 1 and table 2, the performance of OpenCon is pretty close to NACH+CONTROL, which somewhat undermines the claim of the novelty and contributions of CONTROL. A more convincing experiment would be to extend OpenCon with techniques proposed in this paper."
