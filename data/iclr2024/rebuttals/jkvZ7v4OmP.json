                        "value": "Thanks for your suggestions! We provide the following responses to your concerns:\n\n> **W1: The model details are not provided, some details about the model are missing. This makes me a little confused about what kind of model they are using, e.g., invariant ones or Equivariant ones.**\n\nThank you for raising this concern. Our denoising model is invariant to O(3) transformations on lattices, as we denoise the invariant representation $\\mathbf{k}$ rather than $\\mathbf{L}$. Additionally, the model is translation invariant with respect to fractional coordinates, since it takes the **relative** coordinates as input, which remain unchanged under translation.\n\nWe have further improved the clarity of our model description in Section 4.4 and provided a more detailed illustration of the model architecture in Figure 4, Appendix B.1. Specifically, our denoising model consists of four main modules: \n- **Embedding Module** combines the atom embedding and the sinusoidal time embedding into an MLP to acquire the initial node feature.\n- **Message-Passing Module** in Eq. (12-13) iteratively updates the node feature $\\mathbf{h}_i$ via the invariant representation $\\mathbf{k}$ of the lattice, the node feature $\\mathbf{h}_j$ and the relative fractional difference $\\mathbf{f}_j - \\mathbf{f}_i$ between all other nodes.\n- **Output Module** in Eq. (14-15) yields the denoising terms without considering the space group constraints.\n- **Projection Module** finally enforces the constraints by projecting the lattice onto a specific crystal family in Eq. (16) and aligning the atoms belonging to the same Wyckoff position in Eq. (17-18).\n\n> **W2: How they construct the crystal structures from reduced number of atoms N' is not clear.**\n\nSorry for the unclearity. Given a crystal structure with $N'$ Wyckoff positions, we denote that each Wyckoff position contains $n_s$ atoms satisfying $1\\leq s\\leq N'$. Here, $N=\\sum_{s=1}^{N'}n_s$ represents the total number of atoms in a unit cell. We construct the whole crystal structures from reduced number of atoms $N'$ in this way:\n1) For each $s$-th Wyckoff position, we use the notations $\\mathbf{a}'_s$ and $\\mathbf{f}'_s$ to respectively represent the atom type and basic fractional coordinate of  Wyckoff position. \n2) For each atom $s_i$ in the $s$-th Wyckoff position, we denote the atom type and fractional coordinate as $\\mathbf{a}\\_{s\\_i}, \\mathbf{f}\\_{s\\_i}$ (note that $1\\leq s_i \\leq n_s$).\n5) First, we ensure that all atoms in one Wyckoff position have the same type, meaning $\\mathbf{a}\\_{s\\_i}=\\mathbf{a}_{s}$.\n6) Next, for each atom $s_i$, we determine its fractional coordinate using the basic fractional coordinate and its corresponding transformation pair $(\\mathbf{R}\\_{s_i},\\mathbf{t}\\_{s_i})$. Specifically, we calculate $\\mathbf{f}\\_{s\\_i}$ by $\\mathbf{f}\\_{s_i}=\\mathbf{R}\\_{s_i}\\mathbf{f}'\\_s+\\mathbf{t}\\_{s_i}$.\n7) After iterating over all atoms and all Wyckoff positions, we finally obtain the the whole crystal structures.\n\nThe above explanations have been added into Appendix B.3 to address the reviewer's concern. Once again, we appreciate the reviewer for the positive recognition of our work and hope the reviewer's concerns regarding clarity are well-addressed."

Here, we summarize the difference in two main points:\n1) DiffCSP directly generates the lattice matrix $\\mathbf{L}$, while this paper instead generates the coefficients $k$ of the basis in Eq. (12) and (14) to better fulfil the space group constraint. Moreover, according to Proposition 1, the correspondence between the space of the coefficients $k$ and that of the inner product $\\mathbf{L}^\\top\\mathbf{L}$ is bijective. This means our model enjoys the same expressivity with DiffCSP. This is supported by the ablation study in Table 4 where it showcased the comparable performance between DiffCSP and DiffCSP-k.\n2) In Eq. (17), we first project the denoising term in the subspace of Wyckoff position via the pseudo-inverse of the matrix $\\mathbf{R}$ of each atom, and then compute the mean of the projected denoising terms of the atoms in the same Wyckoff position. This constraint is not considered in the original DiffCSP but is crucial for adapting to the diffusion framework described in Section 4.3. \n\n> **W2: The presentation of Table 2.**\n\nThanks for your comment. We agree that the results of DiffCSP++ with GT space groups, which are typically unavailable in real-world settings and should be reported as an upper bound on achievable performance. We have reflected this point in Table 2 by renaming DiffCSP++ as DiffCSP++(w/ GT) to avoide the confusion in the revised paper.\n\n> **W3 & Q1: Does DiffCSP++ in Table 3 use GT space group? is this to be expected?**\n\nNo, DiffCSP++ in Table 3 does NOT use GT space group. Sorry for the confusion. Table 3 is for the ab initio generation task, where the atom types, coordinates and the entire lattice matrix are jointly generated. For the generation of each crystal, we randomly select a sample **from the training set** as the template for the space group. Note that we did no apply GT space group in this task, as the generation is not based on the templates **from the testing set**. Therefore, the results in Table 3 are consistent with the problem domain, and our method can be fairly compared with other approaches and applicable in the real-world setting."

The primary goal in this work is to learn to sample (via diffusion) from a conditional distribution (given the finite space group) rather than an unconditional generation combined with E(n) equivariant networks. The authors do this by decomposing into two parts -  constraints based on an orthogonal group invariant exponential subspace and constraints of fractional coordinates. Subsequently, to tackle the crystal generation problem, the authors employ diffusion models to jointly generate the lattice, the fractional coordinates and atom types conditioned on the obtained constraints pertinent to the space group. The authors then present results on 4 different datasets, for two different tasks (crystal structure prediction and ab-initio crystal generation) where their model outperforms the compared baselines\n\n\nNote to AC: My lower confidence rating is because of lack of expertise with literature relevant to crystal generation."

The big plus of DiffSCP++ is that it is more widely applicable without being constrained to ternary systems.\n4.

We have revised our paper according to your kind suggestions.\n\n> **W1: Proposition 1 and 2 - are simple extensions of two known results from linear algebra - why is this presented without citations - to linear algebra books from Strang, Roman, etc.?**\n\nThanks for your suggestion. For Proposition 1, the polar decomposition is well-known and we have added the citation about the polar decomposition in the revised paper. For Proposition 2, the 6 orthogonal bases of $3\\times 3$ symmetric matrices are specifically designed by us. Although there could be other forms of orthongoal bases, our paper choose the one that straightfowardly distinguishes between different crystal families, as presented in Table 1. We provided a proof of Proposition 2 in Appendix A.2, and have included a citation in the revised paper to support that the space of $3\\times 3$ symmetric matrices has a dimension of 6.\n\n> **W2: Novelty is definitely present - but not something completely unexpected and draws and builds upon existing literature.**\n\nThanks for recognizing our novelty. Here, we would like to further highlight the challengs by injecting space group into the diffusion process. In crystallology, it is well known that space group is closely related important properties of crystals, hence it will be beneficial if the crystal generation model can spontaneously maintain a given space group constraint. However, this is a non-trivial task, which presents two main challenges:\n1) As listed in Table 1, the lattice must conform to a specific shape according to the space group.\n2) Symmetric atoms (namely the atoms in the same orbit) must be updated synchronously, as illustrated by the dashed lines in Figure 2.\n\nTo address these challenges, we divide the constraint into two manageable parts: the basis constraint of the lattice matrix and the Wyckoff position constraint of the fractional coordinates, each of which is exactly retained during the generation process. Overall, while it is a natural enhancement of existing literature by further considering space group constraints, the way we implement the constraints is novel and non-straightforward."
