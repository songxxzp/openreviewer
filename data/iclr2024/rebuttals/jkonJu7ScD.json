Clearly there are missing baselines like RAD [1], DrQv2 [2] according to this study [3] on self-supervised learning with RL, and possibly [4] which uses Transformer for next frame prediciton, and vanilla MAE [5]. With the current baselines I can not evaluate the significance of proposed method, considering the novelty of the proposed method is limited. \n\n4.

We considered all of your comments and suggestions during the rebuttal of our manuscript. All of the changes made in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in blue.\n\n**Q1: Confusing diagram.**\n\nA1: Thank you for your feedback. Our method is self-supervised multi-task learning that combines masked modeling and inverse dynamics modeling. In the context of RL, our approach, like the one in [1], is centered around reconstructing masked or missing information in the latent space, not at the pixel level of predicting the original image. This method has been shown to be effective [1]. Regrading inverse dynamics modeling, our method predicts actions using a classifier based on latent representations from online and IT networks. Acknowledging the reviewer's concern, we agree that Figure 1 might not clearly represent this aspect. We have revised Figure 1 to better illustrate both masked and inverse dynamics modeling, making it easier for readers to understand our method.\n\n[1] Yu, T., Zhang, Z., Lan, C., Lu, Y., & Chen, Z. (2022). Mask-based latent reconstruction for reinforcement learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25117-25131.\n\n**Q2: Clarity.**\n\nA2: To address the high correlation among consecutive frames in RL, we introduced a transformer. It helps capture spatio-temporal information effectively while considering high correlation.\n\nFor inverse dynamics modeling, actions are predicted using a classifier. This classifier utilizes the current state representations from the online network and the next state representations from the IT network. We have revised the manuscript to clearly mentioned in the manuscript, enhancing clarity on how actions are predicted.\n\nRegrading the online network, it simultaneously performs state representation regression for the reconstruction task and action prediction for inverse dynamics modeling. The state representations output from the online and IT networks are used to predict actions through a classifier, while the online and MT networks focus on minimizing state representation errors. We have separate neural networks for each task, ensuring clear task-specific processing.\n\n**Q3: Baselines.**\n\nA3: In response to the reviewer's suggestion, we have included comparison in our revised Table 2. We conducted experiments across six DMControl environments with a limit of 100k interactions. Our method demonstrated notable performance, winning in three out of six environments and outperforming both the mean and median across all environments. Furthermore, we experimented on five tasks of medium-difficulty DMControl with 1M interactions, choosing comparison methods in line with the model-free approach. The comparison methods reported their average scores for six different seeds, while our results are based on two seeds. The results show improved data efficiency of our method at medium-difficulty compared to the baselines. We will conducted additional experiments to ensure a fair comparison and report the results in the final version. Detailed results are described in Appendix C.2.\n\n**Q4: Due to extra architecture and parameter introduced in the transformer module, are the baseline models using the same/similar architecture to ensure the fairness? Is the transformer important in the modeling?**\n\nA4: Our baseline models include transformer-based and transformer-free methods. Among the baseline models, MLR [1] used a transformer with a similar structure to our method. The use of a transformer is crucial in our method due to the high correlation among consecutive frames in RL. This correlation needs a mechanism that can effectively capture spatio-temporal information. Transformers, and other sequence processing architecture like recurrent methods, are important for handling these correlations. In comparison, methods such as CURL [2] and DrQ [3], which do not adequately address this high correlation, tend to be less data-efficient. Therefore, the inclusion of a transformer in our model is not only important for fair comparison but also essential for the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n[1] Yu, T., Zhang, Z., Lan, C., Lu, Y., & Chen, Z.

Later works such as Dreamer-v2/v3, DrQ-v2, A-LIX[1], ATC[2], and TACO[3] mainly consider medium-difficulty tasks as well as the more challenging humanoid domain. Thus, more tasks and especially harder medium-difficulty tasks should be evaluated for the proposed method. I recommend the author to provide a comparison at 1M/2M of harder tasks instead of the six tasks presented in the paper. Also, A-LIX[1], ATC[2], and TACO[3] should be discussed and compared in the empirical evaluation."

                    "value": "As shown by prior works such as [4, 5], the single-step inverse model is theoretically and empirically non-sufficient to capture the full agent-centric representation. For example, in an empty gridworld, a pair of positions separated by two or more spaces may be assigned an identical representation without incurring additional loss in a one-step inverse model.. In contrast, a multi-step inverse model is both theoretically sufficient and in practice achieves good performance. Would MIND benefit from multi-step inverse modeling instead of single-step inverse?\n\nI am willing to raise the score if my above two questions/concerns (a more comprehensive evaluation of continuous control tasks and multi-step inverse model instead of single-step) are addressed. I understand that given the time constraint of rebuttal, the authors are not able to address them fully. But it would be great at least to see the additional experiments on a few medium DMControl tasks.\n\n**Additional References that are not included in the paper**\n- [1] Edoardo Cetin, Philip J.

All of the changes made in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in blue.\n\n**Q1: The evaluation for continuous control tasks are very limited.**\n\nA1: Thank you for the valuable suggestions. We agree with the reviewer that further experiments with continuous control benchmarks is necessary. TACO believes that there is no obligation to compare because it is considered a recent work according to the policy of the conference (https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/ReviewerGuide). Nevertheless, to address the reviewer's concerns, we tested our method on five medium-difficulty DMControl tasks using 1M interactions, as reported by TACO. We selected these tasks to align with our model-free approach and make a comparable analysis with comparison methods. The comparison methods reported their average scores for six different seeds, while our results are based on two seeds. As shown in the table below, the results show improved data efficiency of our method at medium-difficulty compared to the benchmarks. In particular, in the environments Walker, run; Hopper, hop and Reacher, hard, our method outperformed TACO, which was the best performing method among the compared algorithms. We will conduct additional experiments to ensure a fair comparison and report the results in the final version.

Our method, while not direct multi-step approach, integrates elements of this concept. We input states from time *t* to *t+n* into the online network, and the next states from time *t+1* to *t+n+1* into the target network. This setup allows us to predict consecutive actions from time *t* to time *t+n*. In addition, the transformers were used in each network to process highly correlated consecutive frames in RL. A transformer can efficiently summarize information across the input sequence through its attention mechanism. Therefore, while our method differs from traditional multi-step modeling, it effectively captures past or future state dependencies, aligning with the principles of multi-step inverse dynamics.\n\n**Q3: Additional references.**\n\nA3: We have reviewed them and found their insights valuable for our work. We have updated our literature review to include the key contributions."

But if you directly use the results from the TACO paper, you should clearly cite and mention it in your paper.\n\nRegarding Q2, I don't agree the objective used in the paper is doing multistep inverse because for example, to predict action $a_t$, one could only use the information of $s_t$ and $s_{t+1}$ which are coming from the frame stack. But for multistep inverse, you are only given $s_t$ and $s_{t+K}$, and no information about the intermediate states are provided.\n\nI will keep my score."

The big downside I see to this paper is that the method is not extremely novel and the justifications are ad-hoc, whereas the field of representations for RL has seen rapid progress in theoretical analysis, so it should be possible to provide more detailed justifications for the technique.  Nonetheless, I see this paper as a solid empirical contribution."

                        "value": "Thank you for your positive and in-depth comments about our research. We address your concerns in detail below. All of the changes made in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in blue.\n\n**Q1: The justification in this paper for using inverse dynamics along with masked prediction is fairly ad-hoc and informal.**\n\nA1: Thank you for your meaningful comments. The references that the reviewer mentioned have proven the effectiveness of multi-step dynamics modeling. Our method, while not directly adopting the multi-step method, captures similar concepts. The inverse dynamics modeling we propose is designed from the perspective of sequence modeling of the dynamics between consecutive states and actions. We used states from time *t* to *t+n* in the online network and the next states from time *t+1* to *t+n+1* in the target network. Our design predicts the consecutive actions from time *t* to time *t+n*. Because of the high correlation among consecutive frames in RL, we incorporated transformers in each network. These transformers use their attention mechanism to integrate information across the input sequence states. This step, although not a straightforward multi-step approach, effectively captures past or future state dependencies in terms of representation learning. The transformer is a sequence module that has proven to be excellent not only in the field of natural language processing but also in RL. We have enriched subsection 2.3 in our manuscript to include these relevant references and further clarify our method. \n\n**Q2: The basic approach seems similar to combining BYOL (with masking as the augmentation) with a one-step inverse model.**\n\nA2: Our method shares similarities with BYOL in terms of the learning strategy. However, to better handle the unique challenges in RL, we adopted a transformer. This addition is crucial for capturing dependencies on past or future states. It is a technique similar to multi-step inverse dynamics modeling, tailored for learning rich representations of consecutive frames.\n\n**Q3: Why is there an IT network, rather than reusing the MT network for the IT network, perhaps with a distinct head for predicting inverse dynamics?**\n\nA3: The MT and IT networks serve distinct purposes in our method. The MT network is designed for mask-based reconstruction, aiming to reconstruct missing state information at a specific point in time. On the other hand, the IT network focuses on inverse dynamics modeling. It outputs representations of the next states that is used to predict actions. This division of tasks is essential for our self-supervised multi-task learning approach, where each network is specialized for its special functionality.\n\n**Q4: Why not also use masking of the inputs to the IT network?**\n\nA4: Our method uses masking augmentation exclusively in the online network for the reconstruction task. This is to focus on missing information without the need for separate data augmentation for learning visual representations. On the other hand, the IT network is tailored for inverse dynamics modeling. It extracts representations for a series of next states, capturing essential information about rapidly changing states. While our method conducts both reconstruction and inverse dynamics modeling simultaneously, the objectives differ. Therefore, we input the original or unmasked data into the IT network to align with its specific purpose."

                        "value": "Thank you for your meaningful comments on our method and experiment. We considered all of your comments and suggestions during the revision of our manuscript. All of the changes made in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in blue.\n\n**Q1: In equation one, *c*, *t*, *p*, and *q* are not defined.**\n\nA1: Thank you for your careful reading. In equation one, the CNN, transformer, projector, and predictor are denoted by *c*, *t*, *p*, and *q*, respectively. We have provided description of these terms in Section 3.\n\n**Q2: It would be good to report confidence intervals in results, for instance in Table 1.**\n\nA2: Thank you for your suggestion. We have included the standard deviations of the human-normalized scores for each game in Table 1. In addition, Figures 2 and 3, as well as Table 2, provide information about the confidence interval or standard deviation.\n\n**Q3: The paper doesn't seem very novel.**\n\nA3: Mask-based reconstruction and dynamics modeling are established techniques in representation learning. However, their application in RL, especially in rapidly changing environments, is still largely unexplored. Our work is novel in that we are among the first to combine dynamics modeling with masked modeling in a self-supervised multi-task learning framework. This approach specifically addresses the limitations noted in previous methods (referenced in [1]). Our focus extends beyond just learning visual representations. We also aim to capture the controllable elements in environments with rapid state changes. To handle the high correlation between consecutive frames in RL, we introduced a transformer. This aids in predicting a series of actions by analyzing correlations and spatio-temporal information of consecutive states. Furthermore, we conducted systematic experiments to establish best practices in this area. Our findings show that integrating inverse dynamics modeling in latent space, like MLR [1], enhances efficiency in rapidly evolving environments. This advancement in methodology represents a significant contribution to the field.\n\n[1] Yu, T., Zhang, Z., Lan, C., Lu, Y., & Chen, Z. (2022).

Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 35, 25117-25131.\n\n**Q4: Can the authors provide some intuition why masking + momentum contrast outperforms other baseline methods?**\n\nA4: Data augmentation techniques work very sensitively in RL. In previous studies [1][2], they empirically experimented with various data augmentations and reported which augmentation can deliver the correct reward signal to the agent. On the other hand, masked modeling, which only considers masking augmentation, is a simple yet effective way to reconstruct missing data. Typical reconstruction tasks make predictions at the pixel-level. However, in RL that leverages latent representations to learn the agent's policy, it is important to reconstruct missing state information in the latent space. In terms of learning representations for states, momentum contrast (i.e., self-distillation approach [5]) has been shown to excellent at preventing representation collapse, benefiting from its asymmetric architecture and exponential moving average updating [3][4][5]. SPR [3], demonstrated that without a target network, performance declines due to representation collapse. MLR [6] combines the strengths of both masking and momentum contrast to reconstruct latent representations, proving to be more effective than previous studies.\n\n[1] Yarats, D., Kostrikov, I., & Fergus, R.
