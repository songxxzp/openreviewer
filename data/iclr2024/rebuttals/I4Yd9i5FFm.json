Indeed, the setting of momentum in the existing strategy is far from ideal, however, it is very hard to find a simple rule, as done in this paper, to determine it. \n\nSince the discussion is not convincing, the authors have to use experiments to show the advantage of the proposed methods. However, the experiments are not convincing neither. To show the advantages over popular optimizers, the experiments should include different structures (CNN/ViT/w/o BN/w/o skip connection, etc.), different tasks (imagenet, segmentation, detection, etc.), different scenario (different initializations, different setting), and different baselines (different optimizers, different setting, and different recent modifications). Most importantly, the setting of other methods should be good, e.g., using some well-accepted setting. Overall, the current experiments are not sufficient: one can always cherry-pick good result for a heuristic strategy."

Unlike existing adaptive methods such as Adam, which are primarily suitable for sparse gradients, LCAM is designed to be adaptable to all types of datasets. The authors propose averaging the loss to segment the training process into different phases, each with its distinct momentum. The paper also introduces the concepts of weight coupling and weight traction, suggesting that weights have a directional specificity based on dataset sparsity. The experiments primarily utilize Wide Residual Networks (WRN) on the Cifar10 and Cifar100 datasets. The results indicate that LCAM can achieve comparable or better accuracy with nearly half the training epochs compared to traditional SGD methods."

To this end, it separates weights into non-sparse and sparse groups that change quickly and slowly during training, respectively. Then it proposes a weight-traction model to justify the underperformance of adaptive methods (such as Adagrad or Adam) on non-sparse dataset (e.g. CIFAR10). The main argument is that the rapid change in the non-sparse weights (caused by rapid decrease in the corresponding learning rates) causes the overall weight shifting towards the sparse side. To accommodate datasets of different sparsity, this works proposes a method that uses different momentum parameters for sparse and non-sparse training phase, which is determined by comparing the current loss to the average loss.  It empirically verifies that choosing a proper momentum parameter for non-sparse or sparse weights (depending on dataset sparsity) leads to better performance."

Despite the attempt to give an intuitive explanation, many of the concepts are not well defined or explained, e.g., weight coupling, oscillatory state, coupling state. Overall, section 3 is difficult to follow, and the motivation is not convincing.\n2. The experiments are only conducted on CIFAR10/100 with wide resnet, and do not show significant improvement. Moreover, the accuracy values do not have confidence intervals.\n3. It is unclear how the multiple hyperparameters are determined, and no ablation study is provided to justify the design choices.\n4. Some of the experimental results seem inconsistent. For instance, curves 1 and 4 in Fig. 4 do not match at the early stage of training when they share the same momentum value."
