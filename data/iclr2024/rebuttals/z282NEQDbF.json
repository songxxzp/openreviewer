The core idea is to formulate a k-wise distillation loss that compares the teacher and student representations of k different data points via self-similarity. The claim is that by having $k$-wise distillation loss function, the student can have exponentially more $\\mathcal O(n^k)$ comparisons to learn from."

For example, the method itself is not clear: for $k=2$ in the stochastic optimization setting, are the pairwise comparisons done on a per-batch setting? \n* The method is not well-motivated or explained in context of prior works in Relational Knowledge Distillation. The loss here is KL divergence between $\\mathrm{softmax}(\\hat z_i - \\hat z_j)$ and $\\mathrm{softmax}(z_i - z_j)$, and the subtraction is motivated in Sec. 5.3. But, why does taking the KL divergence of the softmaxed difference of logits even make sense here? Why does, for instance, the squared difference between the normed differences, e.g., $$\\left(\\frac{||\\hat z_i - \\hat z_j||}{||\\hat z_i|| ||\\hat z_j||} - \\frac{||z_i - z_j||}{|| z_i ||||z_j||}\\right)^2$$ not make sense? How is the proposed approach novel and better than prior metrics used in relational KD?\n* My biggest qualm is that the entirety of the work is supported only by evaluations on CIFAR100, and no other datasets. Favorable evaluations on other data sets such as ImageNet and other tasks, such as language, would significantly improve the paper. As it stands, the claims of the paper rest solely on CIFAR100."

This paper provides further evidence that KD approaches that mimic teacher outputs are not an effective distillation method, and supports relation-based/contrastive KD efforts for distillation.\n\nI similarly find this idea of few-teacher-inference knowledge distillation an interesting direction of research, and it is a nice contribution to have coined this term in the paper. Overall, the paper was interesting to read and naturally raised interesting clarification and next-step questions."

                    "value": "My biggest concern is that this work is eerily similar to the relational knowledge distillation work (Park et al., 2019) barring the high-dimensional KD loss in CKD. I can appreciate that having a higher-dimensional loss formulation might be effective in tightly capturing relationships between two samples as compared to a single number as is the case in [1], however, I would have expected there to be further analysis on why this single differentiating factor elicits such a big change in empirical performance. I feel that there should be more emphasis on this aspect, and I find that Section 5.3 with the comparison function hints towards this direction, if you had to employ the same comparison function employed by [1], you should retrieve RKD in its complete form.\n\nTo address these concerns, I would encourage the authors to offer some justifications in the paper as to why a higher dimensional comparison between groups of samples is that effective in FTI-KD.\n\nMinor concerns:\n\n- Could the authors provide results that are averaged by more than three trials? Could you do more than 10 trials? Especially in Figure 2.\n\n- In Table 1, I assume the value and the subscript represent the mean and the variance. Could this be made clear in the caption?\n\n- In Figure 3, could you plot the x-axis beyond k>4 to get a better idea of the trend? Could you also average this over more than 3 trials?\n\n[1] Park, W., Kim, D., Lu, Y. and Cho, M., 2019. Relational knowledge distillation.

Inference in general is cheap, and fast. In comparison to jointly training a teacher and student model, having access to a teacher's inference is already a substantial improvement in computational resource time.  Could you provide more clarity on this?\n\n- How do you select the samples for each group to compute the centroid, are samples randomly selected or there is a method that is employed? \n\n- In Table 2, is there a reason why other methods beyond CKD were omitted in the white-box analysis?"

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "1. The authors have motivated the Few-Teacher-Inference (FTI) setting and have proposed a method for that setting. However, there is no explanation for why the proposed distillation objective is better suited for it compared to the other baselines. This is especially relevant because there have been works which have tried to distill the *relationship* between the samples; beyond RKD, which the paper has cited and compared, there are also [1, 2, 3] (I am not asking the authors to compare to these). Given that these works are similar in spirit, what is different about the particular objective, beyond its empirical effectiveness?\n\n2. Continuing along the previous point, it is not clear why this method is relevant for few-shot settings specifically. What happens if you use this objective for the typical KD setting (same as Tian et al.) where you do have all the samples from the training set? That is, performing distillation using CKD on all the training examples. Does it still perform better than the baselines?\n\n3. I think there is a slight confusion in what the authors are providing as the motivation for Few-Teacher-Inference vs their actual experimental setup. Limited teacher call means that you only want to get teacher's responses on few-images. But the student can still be trained on the remaining examples with ground-truth (one-hot) labels. However, the experimental setup seems to be dealing with *few-shot* training scenario, in which you only have access to few training images. The authors should clarify this and present results according to their motivation in the beginning. For example, a sample experimental setup will look something like this: typical KD setup  = distilling on 50,000 images. Few-Teacher-Inference setup = distilling on 2000 images, **normal training** (L_CE; Eq. 4) on the remaining 48,000 images.\n\n4. Across the paper, as mentioned above, the explanation for many choices are not clear. For example, in Sec 5.3, the explanation for why difference, as opposed to interpolation (or other variant) of two output vectors performs better is not clear (Page 8; Table 3). Overall, it is difficult for a reader to get a comprehensive understanding for why things are working. As a sample question which is left unexplored - the objective makes the student mimic the difference. However, multiple outputs could have had the same difference; i.e., there is a loss of information. Yet, this loss does not hinder student's performance (and increases it). Why should it be this way?\n\n5. Even beyond this, I do not think the very specific problem is practically useful. It will be useful in case you want to use Few-Teacher-Inference (FTI) to match the performance of teacher inference on all the samples. That is, the knowledge that you inherit from the teacher using CKD is the similar whether you use 1000 teacher inferences or 10,000 teacher inferences. \n\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Knowledge Distillation via Instance Relationship Graph.
