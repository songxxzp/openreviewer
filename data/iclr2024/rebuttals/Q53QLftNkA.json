The model is pre-trained  to reconstruct  the input features using MSE loss. Once the models are trained, the embeddings are passed through an MLP classifier to perform 10 different utterance-level speech tasks. As compared to the vanilla masked auto encoders, the proposed multi-window masked AE (MW-MAE) performs slightly better on those 10 tasks based on the overall score. If we look at each task separately, on some tasks the vanilla MAE performs better and in others the proposed MW-MAE performs better although the differences are usually small."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their comments. We have addressed your comments one by one.\n\n> Multiscale approaches are not particularly new but this might be the first application of it to audio representation learning with masked AE.\n\nVarious approaches to local and global attention  have been applied to audio representation learning before (as several of our references indicate), but we have proposed a novel method with local-global windows within the same multihead module. Our approach is not merely novelty in application, it\u2019s a new approach to local-global attention modelling.\n\n## Weaknesses And Questions\n\n> 1. Marginal gains with the proposed approach .... MW-MAE is better by a small margin.\n\nWithin the reported 95% confidence intervals, MW-MAEs consistently outperform MAEs in a host of conditions and scenarios. \n\n1. The overall performance of MW-MAEs is considerably better than MAEs in a wide variety of conditions such as:  \n    a. low data scenarios.  \n    b. For larger encoder complexities: 92.6\u00b10.2 vs 90.0\u00b10.2 for ViT-L is a considerably large improvement, especially considering it\u2019s an aggregation over 10 tasks.\n2. At the task level,   \n    a. MW-MAEs consistently outperform their MAE counterparts on majority of the tasks. For example, ViT-L based MW-MAE from table 2 achieves an absolute performance improvement of 2.3%, 2%, 1.2%, 2.2%, 1.8%, 1.7%, 5% on CD, ESC-50, LC, NS-5h, SC-5h, FSD50k and VL tasks, respectively. That is a considerable improvement across the board on 7/10 tasks.   \n    b. The only tasks it does not improve on, are BO, Mri-S and Mri-T, where MW-MAEs are within the reported 95% confidence intervals, not worse. This observation is mostly consistent across all our experiments. We suspect this is due to performance saturation on these tasks, as also suggested by the HEAR leaderboard [a].  \n\n> 2. The local vs. global feature aspect of the model is not well-supported...global features at utterance level.\n\nBefore continuing, we would like to add that just because a task is evaluated at utterance level, it doesn\u2019t mean that local information was not leveraged at all. For example, FSD50K is a multilabel audio tagging task, with multiple audio events occurring throughout the audio clip. While prediction is done at the utterance level, rich local feature information is crucial for detecting all the audio events present in the audio clip. This local information is consolidated over the layers and assimilated into a feature representation. Also, we have shown extensive, quantitative exploratory analysis in Section 5.1 that verifies that the proposed MW-MAE captures a better mix of local and global attention.\n\nHaving said that, we appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. We have conducted additional experiments comparing MAE and MW-MAE base configurations on MAESTRO-5h, a frame-level music transcription task, which is a part of the HEAR benchmark. We chose MAESTRO-5h over DCASE 2016 Task 2 because our test suite includes ESC-50 and FSD50K, which already span office sound environments. It is evaluated in a 5-fold cross-validation setting, with the Onset FMS evaluation metric. We conducted the experiments 5 times and reported 95% confidence intervals over the cross-validation scores of individual runs.\n\n| Model | Onset FMS |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n| MAE-Base | 46.47\u00b10.05 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 47.31\u00b10.07 |\n\nMW-MAE does improve performance on MAESTRO-5h. While this might not look like much, at the time of writing this comment, **MW-MAE outperforms every method on the HEAR leaderboard [a] for MAESTRO-5h, including large multi and cross-modal ensemble methods**, so this is excellent performance for a single method. For reference, a pre-trained Wav2Vec2-Base only achieves an Onset FMS of 3.29 [a].\n\nWe didn\u2019t compare all methods on MAESTRO to begin with, because it poses serious computation (and space) complexity: it takes longer to evaluate downstream performance on just MAESTRO than it takes to evaluate all the other downstream tasks combined. For the number of experiments we did in this paper, it was highly unfeasible, more so given that our benchmark suite includes tasks like FSD50K, where local information is known to be of importance [b]. \n\nAlso, in response to reviewer fDLB, we have also posted proof of concept results for Supervised ASR, which might be of relevance in regard to this question.\n\n---\n\nContinued.."

It could have been better to provide a quantitative run-time comparison...\n\nFor our base configuration, the _training time_ throughput of MW-MAE (4109 samples/ sec) is 9.14 % slower than an MAE (4536 samples/sec) on the same hardware. This is primarily due to kernel call overhead of the MW-MHA module since we have to make individual calls for each attention head in an MW-MAE, whereas optimized MHA implementations do so in one kernel call.  A better native implementation can alleviate this difference, and we are working on that.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that since the decoder is discarded after pretraining, _there is no difference in throughput when running downstream experiments/inference/finetuning_ since the encoders are identical. \n\n> 4. [Minor comment] It could have been better if the 10 tasks were mentioned in the main text before Table 1 rather than leaving the list to the Appendix.\n\nThat is an oversight on our behalf. We will mention the 10 tasks in the main text, however, the table will remain in the Appendix due to space limitations.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the valuable feedback and for engaging in a discussion with us!

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their comments!\n\n> The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.\n\nWe are glad that the reviewer found the paper easy to read! We gave it our best!\n\n> The proposed approach to enhancing multi-head attention is straightforward, yet it demonstrates a performance boost.\n\nThanks for the words of encouragement! It elates us that the reviewer also sees the strength in our simple yet effective approach!\nNow, allow us to address your concerns!\n\n---\n\n## Concerns regarding applicability and contribution\n\n> The proposed method involves applying self-attention over .... using the masked autoencoder structure, and specifically for the decoder.\n\n### [Proof of concept 1: Auxiliary Modality] MW-MAEs on ImageNet\n\nWe would like to bring to your attention our initial experimental results using Masked Autoencoders for computer vision on the ImageNet dataset (as presented in Appendix D). We pretrained MAE and MW-MAEs with ViT-Medium encoder and a 4-layer decoder with 8 attention heads and 512 feature dimensions on ImageNet for 100 epochs, followed by evaluating linear probe performance (training for 50 epochs). MW-MAE outperforms MAE by almost 1% in validation accuracy. \n\n| Model | Params | Validation Acc |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| MAE- Medium Encoder | 38 M | 29.0\u00b10.0 |\n| MW-MAE Medium Encoder | 38 M | 29.8\u00b10.0 |\n\n### [Proof of concept 2: Auxiliary Task] MW-MHA for Supervised ASR\n\nWe have conducted some preliminary experiments to investigate the applicability of the proposed MW-MHA module beyond MAEs. We evaluated Supervised Transformer based ASR models, trained using CTC objective function. We trained on LibriSpeech 100h subset and reported Word Error Rates (WER) on the test sets, using validated recipes from the SpeechBrain toolkit. We will add these results to the appendix.\n\n- The network architecture used consists of a 2-layer Convolutional frontend, followed by a 12-layer encoder and 4-layer decoder, each with 4 attention heads. We trained on mel-filterbanks with 80 mel bins.\n- For the MW-MHA Transformer, we only replaced the MHA blocks in the encoder with MW-MHA blocks, and used attention window sizes of 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and global attention corresponding to the number of timeframes obtained from the largest audio segment in the corpus.\n- MW-MHA transformer outperforms baseline transformer by a considerable margin on both test sets.\n\n| Model | Params | Test Clean WER | Test Other WER |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Transformer | 8.7 M | 7.56 | 17.90 |\n| MW-MHA Transformer | 8.7 M | 6.73 | 17.20 |\n\nWhile the scope of our investigation in this paper is confined to self-supervised learning, audio and masked autoencoders, these two auxiliary experiments clearly indicate that the proposed approach has the potential for wide applicability!\n\n---\n\n> Compared to the previous work, Audio-MAE, which addressed challenges in initially applying MAE to the audio domain, this study merely demonstrates the effects of improving a specific part of the structure.\n\nAudio-MAE addressed how global attention is suboptimal for spectrograms if the time-frequency information of interest is predominantly local, and to this end, they proposed to incorporate SWIN [a] based attention in some transformer blocks of _only the decoder_ of their MAE (similar to us!). We are addressing the same challenges as AudioMAE did!\n\nFurthermore, compared to AudioMAE:\n\n1. We perform more exhaustive evaluation of patch sizes, which is a key hyper-parameter that differs between MAEs for Vision v/s audio, as demonstrated by [b]. [b] precedes the AudioMAE paper and, chronologically, were the first to address the nuances of applying masked autoencoders to audio.\n2. We evaluate on a larger, more varied selection of tasks, addressing a wider variety of challenging applications in the audio domain.\n3.  We also conducted direct in-depth exploratory analysis of the local-global effects in the audio domain, measuring quantifiable variances in attention distances and entropies, which was missing from AudioMAE.\n\nThus, we believe our contributions are just as significant, as we go above and beyond in several facets of investigating the challenges of applying MAE to the audio domain.\n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\n> I have concerns regarding the limited applicability and contribution of this research, as mentioned in the above weaknesses.\n\nAddressed above.\n\n> Typo: (6p, Sec. 4.3.) ...\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention! We will fix this.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAgain, we thank the reviewer for their input and for engaging in a discourse! We hope we were able to address your concerns and look forward to answering any more questions!\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[a] Liu et al. 2021, \u201cSwin transformer: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows.\u201d  \n[b] Niizumi et al. 2022, \"Masked Spectrogram Modeling using Masked Autoencoders for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation\u201d."

I acknowledge that this research provides sufficiently comprehensive experiments and analysis. The results of the auxiliary experiments they provided demonstrate that the proposed method is effective not only in self-supervised learning for audio data but also in ASR. Consequently, I would like to revise my rating to a 6. However, I still retain some reservations, particularly since many challenges addressed in this work were previously tackled in AudioMAE and its concurrent works. Additionally, as mentioned in the \"Author's Response to Reviewer 4eUM,\" the increase in training time due to the introduced architecture somewhat negates the efficacy of the proposed method."

It feels great that you are also enthusiastic about the applicability of our approach!\n\n>  Additionally, as mentioned in the \"Author's Response to Reviewer 4eUM,\" the increase in training time due to the introduced architecture somewhat negates the efficacy of the proposed method.\n\nThe performance reduction in training time is solely due to implementation: Multi Head Attention has gone through several rounds of optimization of the kernel implementation in low-level code (CUDA, ROCm etc) and calls all attention heads in a single kernel call, which significantly optimizes issues such as memory transfer and kernel overheads. Our implementation as of now, as we pointed out to reviewer 4eUM, calls underlying attention heads individually which leads to overhead. We have complete confidence that a better implementation of native windowed attention can iron out these issues!\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOverall, we would like to thank the reviewer for taking the time to review our paper, and providing feedback which has proved of immense benefit, and finally, for investing the time to go through our rebuttal and additional experiments."

The authors attributed the improvement on that MW-MAE encoder learn heads with broader local and global attention, and then utilized attention entropies and distances analysis to support this argument. The authors utilized CCA to demonstrate that Multi-Window Multi-Head Attention in the decoder can independently capture local and global information."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their comments. We are happy that the reviewer finds our analysis in Sec 5 appropriate! Let us address your concerns.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n> 1. Typos such as \"we use fixed sinusuidal positional embeddings\"\n\nThanks for bringing this to our attention! We\u2019ll fix this and comb through the content for typos again.\n\n> 2. lack of parameter explanation in 3.1\n\n$Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times {d_m}}$ represent query, key and value input matrices, and $W_i^Q, W_i^K, W_i^V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_m \\times d_k}$ are their corresponding learnable projection matrices. $d_m$ is the model's feature dimension, and $d_k = \\frac{d_m}{h}$.\n\nWe\u2019ll add this to the main text in Sec 3.1\n\n> 3. Another work [1] proposed very similar ideas that introducing local attentions in the decoder can help improve the MAE learner. They tried local attentions only and hybrid attentions in which they applied global attentions on top layers. Although This paper compared MW-MAE with audioMAE and MW-MAE outperformed audioMAE by a lot, it is still unclear to me why MW-MAE is much better with such a similar design. I attached my questions in below.\n> \n\n[a], which precedes AudioMAE, presented extensive experiments for training masked autoencoders on Audioset. Early on, we observed that their approach performed better than AudioMAE, and we thus build upon [a] to build a stronger baseline than AudioMAE. Key differences include:\n\n1. For the base configuration, AudioMAE has a patch size of 16x16. Our MAE baseline has a patch size of 16x4, which gives better temporal resolution.\n2. AudioMAE is trained on full 10-sec audio clips, whereas our models are trained on random 2-second crops, based on the published results of [a] where 2-sec crops offer a great performance/training time tradeoff.\n\nWe have already discussed these design decisions in section 4.2.\n\n> Have you tried re-training audioMAE with your current settings?\n> \n\nThis stronger MAE baseline is used for fair, direct comparison with the proposed MW-MAE approach. Since we already had a stronger baseline, for consistency and being truthful to the source, we decided to conduct downstream experiments for AudioMAE using the official pre-trained model and code.\n\n> 4. Introduction section and Related Works section overlapped by a lot.\n\nIntroduction lays the ground work of the relevant literature & the Related works section expands on it with commentary on specific approaches. We will clear up repetitive references & explanations.\n\n> 5. There should be another line \"enc only\" in table 2.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have now also included this extra experiment on MW-MAE Base (encoder only) setting. We didn\u2019t believe originally that it was necessary, given that enc+dec doesn\u2019t provide substantial improvements for pre-training. Following will be the updated Table 2:\n\n| Model | Downstream $s(m)$ | Linear Probe (mAP)  | Fine-tuning (mAP) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |\n| MAE Base | 88.1\u00b10.2 | 23.1\u00b10.0 | 26.1\u00b10.4 |\n| MW-MAE Base (decoder only) | 89.2\u00b10.2 | 24.2\u00b10.1 | 26.1\u00b10.7 |\n| MW-MAE Base (encoder only) | 89.1\u00b10.3 | 23.6\u00b10.0 | 26.1\u00b10.3 |\n| MW-MAE Base (enc+dec) | 89.1\u00b10.3 | 24.0\u00b10.1 | 26.2\u00b10.0 |\n\nWhile there is no difference in performance when fine-tuning, there is a considerable decline in performance in the encoder only setting for linear probe performance. The overall conclusion from the paper, regarding the addition of MW-MHA modules, doesn\u2019t change. \n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\n> 1. I'm wondering whether the results of audioMAE and MW-MAE are comparable, what is the patch size and spectrogram size of audioMAE you are using? Have you tried re-training audioMAE with your current settings?\n> \n\nwe have answered this in the section above.\n\n> 2. According to paper [1], their number of audioMAE(local) on ESC-50 was 94.1 and your number of audioMAE on ESC-50 is 60.6, what is the difference?\n> \n\nESC-50 number reported in AudioMAE is a result of supervised fine-tuning of the entire encoder. This is different from our setting, where we follow the HEAR [b] protocol and conduct downstream experiments by training an MLP on top of fixed feature vectors, and do not fine-tune the entire encoder. This is inline with recent approaches for evaluating self-supervised audio representations [b, c].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe thank the reviewer for engaging in the discussion and hope we were able to address your concerns. We look forward to answering any further questions the reviewer might have!\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[a] Niizumi et al., 2022, \u201cMasked spectrogram modeling using masked autoencoders for learning general-purpose audio representation\u201d.  \n[b] Turian et al., 2022, \u201cHEAR: Holistic Evaluation of Audio Representations\u201d  \n[c] Yang et al., 2021, \u201cSUPERB: Speech Processing Universal PERformance Benchmark\u201d"

If the gap between MW-MAE and AudioMAE only comes from patch size and spectrogram size difference, the novelty should be considered marginal."

For instance, AudioMAE gave us 68.2\u00b10.2 and 37.9\u00b10.1 for CD and FSD50K. For the same tasks, MSM-MAE numbers from [a] were 70.4 and 50.8, respectively. Considering the efforts that go into reproducing a paper, the decision to build upon the stronger baseline seemed justified to us. And thus, the performance gap cannot be chalked merely to difference in patch and spectrogram size.\n\n| I'm wondering how much that MW-MAE outperforms AudioMAE under the same settings\n\nWe understand your concern and point of view. We have been running experiments comparing AudioMAE (essentially SWIN Transformer in the decoder) with our proposed approach under identical settings: smaller patch size than original AudioMAE, smaller decoder than original AudioMAE (4 layers instead of 16), 2-second audio crops vs 10. We'll get back to you once we have the results."

However, MW-MAEs ($s(m)=89.2\u00b10.2)$ still demonstrate a considerable absolute improvement of 3.1% in overall score over the AudioMAE model ($s(m)=86.1\u00b10.3$). \n\nGiven that we have now compared the two methods in identical settings, we can conclude that this performance gap between AudioMAE and MW-MAE is due to better local-global attention modelling capabilities of the proposed approach.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion, as this further demonstrates the strength of our approach. We hope this addresses your concerns and we eagerly wait to hear back from you.\n\n*EDIT: Added MAE results as well.\n\n---\n\n## References  \n[1] Huang et al., 2022, \"Masked Autoencoders that Listen\""

                    "value": "1.The conceptualization of this article is relatively straightforward. Building upon the previous global-local attention mechanism, previous studies did not incorporate a hierarchical design for the local window perspective. Hence, the author implemented a mechanism with varying window sizes for each attention head within the multi-head attention mechanism. This initial approach is commendable. I am intrigued to know if the author is the originator of this multi-window local-global attention concept for the first time. No pertinent references were found at the end of the introduction, maybe leaving open the possibility of existing similar ideas in the fields of computer vision or natural language processing.\n\n2.In terms of the experimental aspect, \"the default configuration employed by the authors yields np = 250, resulting in window sizes of [2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250, 250] for each MW-MHA module in all decoder blocks, encompassing a total of eight attention heads.\" Although the author clarifies that this hyperparameter design covers several possible local context levels and adopts a simplistic set of designs, further ablation experiments pertaining to this aspect would be valuable.\n\n3.Corresponding to the points highlighted by the author in Appendix G, the experiments conducted solely focused on the (AS-5k) dataset. However, as a self-supervised model, it is expected that the author would train on larger datasets, given the significance of datasets such as librilight, which have already amassed 60k hours of data. Furthermore, exploring the model's performance on larger datasets would provide insights into its upper limits.\n\n4.A meticulous examination of the author's ablation experiments on the parameters of MAE in the appendix reveals that, under different parameter configurations and tasks, MW-MAE does not exhibit significant improvements compared to MAE. For instance, [BO, Patch Size=(4\u00d78), n=500, h=12, MAE 96.7\u00b10.2, MW-MAE 95.6\u00b10.7], [Mris-s all], [Mri-T all]. Similar observations can be made in the main experiments presented in Table 1. In certain tasks, a comprehensive enhancement is not evident. Consequently, I eagerly anticipate the author's elucidation regarding this aspect."

Alternatively, more engaging designs and comparisons could be conducted by examining the relationship between the number of attention heads, network hierarchies, and window sizes."

We also elucidate how the proposed approach differs from existing approaches in Section 3.1. These references span domains beyond audio representation learning. \n\n## Weakness 2\n\n> In terms of the experimental aspect ..... further ablation experiments pertaining to this aspect would be valuable.\n> \n\nSince this weakness overlaps with the question posed by the reviewer, we have addressed both these issues here. We have already conducted extensive experiments w.r.t. network hierarchy (as per Sec 4.4). Thus, we focus on further ablations exploring the downstream performance impact of different window sizes and the number of attention heads, as shown in Table below. All evaluated methods have an identical encoder (ViT-Base, 4x16 patch size), number of patches $n_p = 250$, the same number of decoder layers ($l=4$) with the same hidden dimension ($d=384$). We will add detailed results to the appendix (we were having trouble squeezing in the full markdown table in a textbox).\n\n\n| model | n_heads | Windows | score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MAE Base | 4 | N/A | 87.6\u00b10.2 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 4 | [5,25,125,250] | **89.5\u00b10.2** |\n|     |    |     |      |\n| MAE Base | 6 | N/A | 86.9\u00b10.2 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 6 | [5,10,25,50,125,250] | **89.1\u00b10.2** |\n|     |    |     |      |\n| MAE Base | 8 | N/A | 88.1\u00b10.2 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 8 | [2,5,10,25,50,125,250,250] | **89.2\u00b10.2** |\n|     |    |     |      |\n| MAE Base | 12 | N/A | 86.8\u00b10.3 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 12 | [2,5,5,10,25,25,50,50,125,125,250,250] | **89.5\u00b10.3** |\n|     |    |     |      |\n| MAE Base | 16 | N/A | 86.4\u00b10.2 |\n| MW-MAE Base | 16 | [2,2,5,5,10,10,25,25,50,50,125,125,250,250,250,250] | **89.7\u00b10.2** |\n\nAs evident, irrespective of the window size used, MW-MAE outperforms MAE in overall performance by a considerable margin.\n\n## Weakness 3\n\n> Corresponding to the points highlighted .... exploring the model's performance on larger datasets would provide insights into its upper limits\n> \n\nWhile we empathize with the reviewer's point of view, there are several reasons to stick to AudioSet. Most larger audio datasets, such as those suggested by the reviewer (LibriLight) and others (e.g. VoxPopuli), comprise only speech data, which does not align with the scope of this paper (general-purpose audio representation learning). For learning audio representations that go beyond speech, AudioSet has been a defacto standard in the community, as it consists of in-the-wild audio spanning an ontology of 527 sounds such as human speech, vehicles, everyday objects, and environmental and animal sounds, to name a few.  AudioSet has been used by several key approaches for unsupervised representation learning, such as COLA [h], BYOL-A [i], SSaST and AudioMAE. For consistent comparison in line with existing literature as well as alignment with the scope of our work, picking AudioSet was the ideal choice.\nOur motivation for evaluating MAEs v/s MW-MAEs when using different amounts of pre-training data (Section 4.4) was to simulate how performance treads with dataset scale, where MW-MAEs outshine MAEs consistently.\n\n---\n\nContinued.."

This phenomenon is observed only for BO, Mri-S and Mri-T tasks, as also discovered by the reviewer. Based on our observations for larger model configurations, we believe performance on these datasets to be saturated around this upper range (for e.g. no model breaks 98% mark on Mri-S, not even the very large ViT-L and ViT-H configurations). This is also supported by observations from the HEAR leaderboard [j], where even multi-modal ensembles of several large models do not go beyond this performance. \n\nThroughout the paper, we have shown exhaustive evidence that shows that MW-MAEs consistently outperform MAEs by a considerable margin on other, more difficult tasks (such as FSD50k: 53.5\u00b10.1 vs 51.8\u00b10.1 for ViT-L encoder), as well as in overall performance (92.6\u00b10.2 vs 90.0\u00b10.2 for ViT-L). Within 95% confidence intervals, MW-MAEs outperform MAEs consistently on 7/10 tasks while being on par on the other 3 tasks. For example, ViT-L-based MW-MAE from table 2 achieves an absolute performance improvement of 2.3%, 2%, 1.2%, 2.2%, 1.8%, 1.7%, 5% on CD, ESC-50, LC, NS-5h, SC-5h, FSD50k and VL tasks, respectively. That is a considerable improvement across the board on 7/10 tasks.\n\nAt the same time, it's worth keeping in mind that MW-MAEs demonstrate better performance characteristics for different encoder/decoder complexities as well as different amounts of pre-training data used as shown in Sec 4.4.\n\n---\n\n## Questions\n\n> For instance, is it possible to make these window sizes trainable?\n> \n\nWhile plausible, learnable window sizes for MHA are a non-trivial challenge and at this stage are beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n> Alternatively, more engaging designs and comparisons could be conducted by examining the relationship between the number of attention heads, network hierarchies, and window sizes.\n> \n\nWe have already presented ablations for different encoder and decoder complexities in Sec 4.4 in the main text of the paper. While more configurations can certainly be explored, encoder complexities, for the sake of comparison with previous works, have been limited to known ViT encoders. \n\nAs for more comparisons for relationship between number of attention heads and window sizes, we have just presented them in the previous comment. \n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe thank the reviewer for engaging in a dialogue with us and for valuation suggestions. We hope we were able to address your concerns, and hope to hear back!\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[a] Liu et al. 2021, \u201cSwin transformer: Hierarchical vision transformer using shifted windows.\u201d   \n[b] Dong et al. 2022, \u201cCSWin Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone With Cross-Shaped Windows\u201d.  \n[c] Beltagy et al., \u201cLongformer: The Long-Document Transformer.\u201d   \n[d] Fan et al. 2021, \u201cMultiscale vision transformers\".  \n[e] Li et al. 2022, \u201cMvitv2: Improved multiscale vision transformers for classification and detection\u201d.  \n[f] Zhu and Omar, 2023, \u201cMultiscale audio spectrogram transformer for efficient audio classification\u201d.  \n[g] Chen at al, 2022, \u201cA hierarchical token-semantic audio transformer for sound classification and detection\u201d.  \n[h] Saeed et al., \"Contrastive Learning of General-Purpose Audio Representations\", ICASSP 2021.  \n[i] Niizumi et al., \"BYOL for Audio: Self-Supervised Learning for General-Purpose Audio Representation\", IJCNN 2021.  \n[j] https://hearbenchmark.com/hear-leaderboard.html"
