                    "value": "However, I have a number of concerns regarding the experimental setting, interpretation of DP and the scalability of the method.\n\nOne note on the epsilon value: it is incredibly misleading to say that the achieved score (<1) is lower (and hence better, or more private) than the rest of the literature. Epsilon does not exist in a vacuum, its meaning for the user is affected (among other things) by: modality, dataset composition, which part of FL falls under DP etc. That being said: it is possible to achieve the same MAGNITUDE of epsilon when these components are vastly different, but this also means that the interpretation of epsilon is no longer the same (i.e. saying that a randomised response epsilon of <1 is more private than DP-SGD of 10 is strenuous at best and fundamentally incorrect at most, as these cannot be directly compared against each other by magnitude alone).\n\nHaving an assumption of a holdout server-side dataset is a bit too strong and not necessarily standard for FL settings."
                },
                "questions": {
                    "value": "By the description of the protocol I am not super convinced this is actually FL: it looks more like some variation of P2P learning, given that clients communicate with each other directly? \n\nFrom what I understood this method is also not applicable to a general FL setting and forces the federation into synchronous FL? Otherwise I am struggling to see how the stale updates would be filtered+handled. Additionally, do all clients assume to be selected each round? The client selection section really does not expand on this.\n\nIs CIFAR-based evaluation the only one considered? Not only are there no results in other modalities (which is typically a limitation, but not always a major one), but there are also no results on more complex image classification datasets either?\n\nOne other point which is missing from the discussion is the concept of influence altogether: here it is presented that positive influence improves the model and it is hence better to consider updates with positive influence. This is in general the case, but I have not seen any discussion on the meaning of influence i.e. higher influence does not always imply that model is improving (as it is possible, particularly in FL with small datasets, to overfit on individual clients). Same goes for tracking influence: having negative influence in round 1 does not prevent the client from having a positive one in a later one (and, in fact, does not always convey that certain clients are \u2018better\u2019, they may simply have simpler, more typical data). I would like authors to discuss/show what happens to influence of the same client over time w/out filtering to see if there is any long-term benefit.\n\nCould authors also point me to how well the method performs (e.g. training time compared to vanilla FL) computationally? Since you mention how prohibitive Shapley values are, I would have expected how much better the proposed method performs. \n\nOverall, I find this work to be rather limited in scope and to have several potential issues, which I would like to be clarified before I can recommend acceptance."

To answer the posed questions:\n\n1) The proposed method is independent of the aggregation strategy and works with any type of Federated Learning.\n\n2) The federation is not forced into synchronization. The main idea is to be able to assign a numeric value to a device's potential contribution to the federation. It can be used as a \"right of passage\" before a device is admitted into the federation. This process can be fully asynchronous. We leave the exploration of an asynchronous approach to future work, intuitively we believe the results would be similar.\n\n3) We mostly focused on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (whose results can be found in the supplementary material), and we are planning to expand our work to different domains in the future.\n\n4) Regarding the overfitting issue, it would be highly unlikely to happen, due to the fact that the different validation sets are sampled from different distributions. Intuitively, the long-term influence of a client would stay positive as long as their data is beneficial, though it would be an interesting direction to explore.\n\n5) The proposed method, used as a tool for quality control, does not have a high communication and computation cost. In the case where we would run it every round scaling it would pose problems for larger federations. The worst-case communication cost would be O(nk), where k is a subset of devices used for evaluation."

For instance, why can the proposed method work in non-IID settings? What type of data can be filtered out by the proposed method? Currently it is not clear to me why or when the proposed method can work.\n\n- Data collection is very challenging for federated learning. In the proposed method, data is further split into training data and validation data. Will this hurt the performance of the model? For instance, if we just use all the data for training, will this be a much stronger baseline? In the current setting 1/3 data is used for validation. More justification is appreciated for this setup.\n\n- Scalability seems to be a question. Say there are $n$ parties. Compared to standard federated algorithm like FedAvg, each party needs to conduct $n$ times more validation computation. And the overall communication seems to scale in $O(n^2)$ since essentially every pair of parties need to communicate with each other.\n\n- Sign SGD [1] seems to be a related reference and needs to be cited.\n\n[1] Bernstein, Jeremy, et al. \"signSGD: Compressed optimisation for non-convex problems.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

                    "value": "This paper considers the problem of federated learning in the setting where we want to preserve privacy under local differential privacy, and want to be robust to mild corruptions. Specifically, corruptions in this setting are not the same as the adversarial corruption notion in other works in this area, such as Byzantine robustness. They assume the users and the servers are honest but curious, and a fraction of the data they have might be corrupted non-adversarially. Their approach draws insights from influence functions. They employ a method which they call lazy iteration that utilizes the influence signs of each new (local) update.\n\nTheir approach is as follows: at each round each contributor user privately sends their updated last layer to another set of users that act as validators. Then each validator checks whether this new update will improve accuracy over the data they have or not, and sends a private vote to the server. Privacy of the vote is both with respect to the data that the validator has and over the data that the contributor has used to provide the update. After that the server decides whether to accept the update of the contributor or not by checking whether the number of accept votes is above some threshold or not. They decide the threshold by doing $k$-means on the total number of positive votes and then setting the average of the two clusters as the threshold.\n\nThey run experiments for 25 communication rounds and compare their results with other methods in this area that provide byzantine robustness as their baseline, for example KRUM [Blanchard et al.] (2017), and Trimmed-mean [Yin et al.] (2018), and Centered-clipping [Karimreddy et al.] (2021). They run their experiments on CIFAR 10 with IID and random labeling and label shift and non iid data with label shift. The way they generate non-iid samples is by sampling from a Dirichlet distribution. They present their experiments and compare with the above Byzantine robustness baselines. Their methods can also be employed together with other Byzantine robust algorithms such as Centered Clipping."

                    "value": "The main conceptual criticism I have is that it is not clear whether this method provides substantial improvements over a private version of Byzantine robust approaches or an alternative central model that is robust under mild corruption assumptions as in this paper. There's definitely some improvements in the experiments, but I think the cost of communication between verifiers and participants may outweigh that. For example, it seems like in this approach, in each round we are going to have quadratic in the number of users total communications, compared to the Byzantine robustness algorithms in previous work that only require a linear number of communications.\n\nI have some other concerns that I will share in the questions section below."

                    "value": "It is not clear whether the baselines in the experiments are also privatized or not.\n\nIn Algorithm 1, does each user send their updated last layer of the model to C as well?\n\nIt is mentioned that the output of the validation being private helps with the other users not being able to tailor their updates to the validation data. From adaptive data analysis we know that such an approach only holds out for a limited number of interactions. How many rounds of interactions / validation can this approach tolerate given say $n$ validation examples? I think this is important because the number of interactions with the hold-out validation data of each user seems to scale with the number of all users, which could be much larger than the amount of validation data a single user has.\n\nIt is mentioned that a drawback of other work int this area is the they may eliminate \"minority\" distributions due to their large distance relative do other model updates. Isn't that also the case in your setting as well? For example if a user has data that comes from a minority distribution, the rest of the users that have validation data that comes from a majority distribution would vote negatively for its update and therefore omitting that update.\n\nIt is mentioned that LDP is a generalization of DP, I'm not sure if generalization is the right word to describe the relationship here.\n\nIn the challenges section, it is mentioned that the Koh & Liang (2017) result requires, O(p) many operations but p is not defined anywhere.\n\nIn the paragraph after figure 2, it is mentioned that even under really strict privacy guarantees, the aggregated influence signs will match the true value in expectation. I'm not sure how to interpret this sentence. The way I interpret it is $\\sum_i \\mathbb{E}[v_i'] = \\sum_i v_i$, which is not true, in fact we have $\\sum_i \\mathbb{E}[v_i'] = (1-p) \\sum_i v_i$.\n\nIn Figure 3, it's not clear to me what communication rounds means here. Does it mean that for 25 rounds all users have sent their proposed updates to the server?"

It can be used to access the data quality of devices before they join a federation and therefore guarantee good quality data.\n\nTo answer the posed questions:\n\n1) The baselines are not privatized. The only privatization applied in this paper is for the lazy influence evaluation scheme.\n\n2) No, our proposed method is completely indifferent to the aggregation strategy of the federation.\n\n3) This is a good question, if we were to run our proposed method every iteration this would become a problem. We have not analyzed this scenario yet and would like to thank you for pointing this out.\n\n4) This is correct if the device has no other devices that share any similarity in distributions. Given a more realistic scenario where there is a small minority instead of a single device, the algorithm can potentially differentiate them from uninformative data. However, more experiments need to be conducted in this scenario to say for certain.\n\n5) You are completely right, we will correct the wording.\n\n6) We apologize for forgetting to include what p is, it represents the number of parameters of the model.\n\n7) To clarify, we meant with that statement that the sign of the aggregated influence signs will match the sign of true value in expectation.\n\n8.)

However it's not clear to me how to compare the improvement to the setting where we're not using this method and are only using a privatized Byzantine robust style algorithm. The accuracy in the setting where we use the technique in this paper on top of the existing algorithms may be better, per round of standard FL. The issue is that the cost of the communication per FL round is going to be quadratic in terms of the number of users when the algorithm in this paper is used, while the cost of communication scales linearly in terms of number of users when for example a privatized Byzantine robust style algorithm is used. So would the right comparison to understand the performance of this algorithm be comparing $1$ FL round of the algorithm in this paper vs. $1$ FL round in a Byzantine robust style algorithm, or would it be $1$ FL round of the algorithm in this paper vs. $n$ rounds of FL in a Byzantine robust style algorithm, where $n$ is the number of users? It's not clear. \n\nI hope I have made my concern clear."
