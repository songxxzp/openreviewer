Meanwhile, a video motion perceptual loss is proposed in this paper. The two contributions presented enable the state-of-the-art performance achieved in this paper."

                        "value": "First, we express gratitude for the reviewer's review. We focused on modeling non-linear motion using multi-frame input without Optical Flow. As a result, we have designed a model that achieves state-of-the-art performance, as mentioned by the reviewer as a \"strength,\" and it is both simple and effective. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss these results with the reviewer. Below is our rebuttal:\n\n**Q1. Will this multiple-input single-output framework have limitations in practical applications? For example, given a T-frame video, how is the first frame or the last stitch of the image processed?**\n\nYes, that is a limitation of our method. The first and the last frames cannot be interpolated. We have added this limitation to the text. (However, with a 1-1-1 setting, our method, like typical VFI approaches, can also interpolate the first and last frames.)\n\n**Q2. EMA-VFI is incorrectly referenced.**\n\nThank you! We have corrected the reference!\n\n**Q3. The length of the METHOD section is too short. The model structure is not presented in the whole paper, and it is not enough to show it only in Figure 2.**\n\nWe have thoroughly revised the Methods section to make the methodology more comprehensible and easier to understand. For additional architecture details, please refer to Appendix C.\n\n**Q4. I think the Table 1 comparison is unfair because the other methods in the table have not been trained on multi-frame video. Therefore Table 1 should not be used as the first table in the experimental chapter. Instead Table 2 will be a fairer comparison.**\n\nWe appreciate your feedback regarding the comparison in Table 1. You are correct that the other methods listed in the table were not trained on multi-frame video, which may lead to an unfair comparison. Acknowledging this concern, we have decided to reposition Table 2 as the first table in the experimental chapter. Table 2 provides a fairer comparison as it evaluates all methods under the same conditions. We believe this adjustment will present a more balanced and accurate evaluation of the different methods.\n\n**Q5. Training according to the model structure proposed in this paper requires more video frames. How did this paper modify the dataset so that it meets the training requirements of the structure proposed in this paper?**\n\nWe did not modify the dataset. Vimeo90K (2-3-2), Middlebury (2-3-2), and UCF101 (5-5-5) officially provide multiple frames. To reduce any misunderstanding, we will detail this information in the implementation details section."

                        "value": "We genuinely appreciate the efforts of the reviewer. As mentioned in the summary, our model interpolates frames for the target time t using multi-frame input without relying on Optical Flow. \n\nAdditionally, MISO-VFI is an implicit model, allowing flexible interpolation for t values not explicitly defined during the training process. Additionally, the Motion Perceptual Loss we propose demonstrates additional performance improvement in situations where the performance is already at a high level, and it is remarkably simple. We are pleased to share and discuss these results with the reviewer. \n\nWe believe that the reviewer's mentioned \"weaknesses\" and \"questions\" will contribute to strengthening our research. Below is our rebuttal:\n\n**Q1. In table 4, the metric SSIM, with only 2D-perceptual, the SSIM is 0.9956, however, with both 2D and 3D perceptual loss, the SSIM is 0.995, but bolded. Besides, it seems that the 2D-perceptual loss did the most contributions, the contribution of 3D perceptual loss is small.**\n\nThe reviewer is correct. Indeed, the 2D perceptual loss contributes more significantly than the 3D perceptual loss. However, we believe that an improvement of 0.16 in a context where PSNR is already at 42 is a considerable enhancement. Additionally, since it is compatible with 2D perceptual loss, we see no reason not to use it, even if the performance gain is slight.\n\n**Q2. I do not find any video examples in the supp. which makes me hard to evaluate the real performances.**\n\nWe have added video samples through an anonymized link. You can find them here: https://sites.google.com/view/miso-vfi\n\n**Q3. They saying \"as VFI is not a task focused on generating plausible images,\" is not accurate. The definition of plausible image and accurate image should be explained.**\n\nAccurate' means that the image is close to the actual Ground Truth (GT). In other words, it implies a high score in pixel-wise metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error). On the other hand, 'plausible' refers to high scores in perceptual metrics such as FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance) or FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance). We have revised the text to reduce any misunderstanding among readers.\n\n**Q4. Estimating motions can still deal with the occlusion challenges, based on what type of occlusions, and how large the temporal T is.**\n\nEstimating motions to address occlusion challenges depends significantly on the type of occlusions and the temporal interval T. For instance, occlusions caused by objects moving across the frame can be more manageable when T is small, as the motion between frames is less complex. However, larger temporal intervals may introduce more significant challenges, especially if the occlusion involves complex movements or transformations. Additionally, the nature of the occluded object, such as its size, shape, and the degree of its overlap with other objects, plays a crucial role in determining the efficacy of motion estimation. Our approach aims to balance these factors to optimize motion estimation under varying occlusion conditions\n\n**Q5. More descriptions of how to read the Fig.1, e.g., what are the white and blue balls, what is the shadow regions, should be clearly stated in the figure caption.**\n\nWe have revised Figure 1 in more detail and also added a caption to it."

                        "value": "Firstly, we express our gratitude for the reviewer's efforts. As noted by the reviewer, our research demonstrates high performance with a straightforward methodology. Additionally, our proposed Motion Perceptual Loss, with its unique originality, has shown additional performance improvements over an already significantly high baseline, even if it may appear to exhibit modest gains. \n\nWe are pleased to share this research with the reviewer and believe that the reviewer's efforts will further strengthen our study. Below is our rebuttal:\n\n**Q1. Hard to find the contributions of this paper. The model architecture is borrowed from an existing work ( though just on arxiv), it is hard to count as this paper's contribution in my opinion. The only new thing in this work is the motion perceptual loss, which is too trivial and straightforward. Moreover, as shown in Tab.4, the improvement introduced by motion perceptual loss is too minor (0.16 PSNR).**\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, MISO-VFI is the first work to achieve state-of-the-art in the VFI field without using optical flow. Furthermore, the architecture that embeds lead time $t$ in VFI is also a novel aspect of our work. Lastly, an improvement of 0.16 in PSNR, especially in a context where PSNR values are already between 38 and 39, represents a significant enhancement in performance\n\n**Q2. Evaluations are not convincing. Tab-1 compares performance for multi-frame-based interpolation. Yet almost all the selected previous SOTA are not optimized for multi-frame input. The used datasets like Vimeo90K, Middlebury, and UCF101 are also very wired for this setting. In general, the reviewer believes the comparisons are unfair and less convincing.**\n\nTable 1 does not represent an entirely fair comparison. To address this issue, we conducted experiments under a fair 1-1-1 setup, as shown in Table 2, and evaluated the performance accordingly. As indicated in Table 2, our approach still achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, Table 1 was designed to demonstrate the significant advantage of using multi-frame input in VFI\n\n**Q3. What are the training details for experiments in Tab-2?**\n\nWe have added detailed experimental information for the experiments in Tables 1 and 2 in the \u2018Dataset setup\u2019 section of the text."

The approach of using an increased number of input frames to interpolate a single intermediate image may lack novelty in its overall concept.**\n\nWhile structures that take multiple frames as input and output a single frame already exist, to our knowledge, this is the first paper to achieve state-of-the-art in Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) without using optical flow.\n\n**Q2. The straightforward substitution of the pre-trained model for perceptual loss can be seen as a technical workaround, and there is a lack of clarity regarding the process of constraining a single interpolated image to achieve 3D-perceptual loss.**\n\nTo operationalize 3D perceptual loss, we concatenate \\( I_{p} \\), \\( \\hat{I} \\), and \\( I_{f} \\) as inputs to \\( \\Phi \\) for loss calculation. We have revised the text to clarify the implementation of 3D perceptual loss.\n\n**Q3.
