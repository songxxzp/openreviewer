Two estimators of the diagonal Hessian, Hutchinson and Gauss-Newton-Bartlett, are discussed. The authors illustrate the intuition behind Sophia via a simple yet convincing example. Some theoretical results are also derived. Numerical experiments are conducted on the pre-training of large language models to demonstrate the significant speed-up over other optimizers like AdamW and Lion."

The use of diagonal Hessian exploits the curvature to accelerate convergence while keeping per-iteration cost comparable to first-order methods. Furthermore, the coordinate-wise clipping safeguards the iterates from unreliable second-order information and improves stability. The example and discussion in Section 2.1 illustrate the intuition behind Sophia in a very clear manner. The numerical experiments are comprehensive and the performance of Sophia looks quite strong."

The theoretical guarantee is for an algorithm which is (almost) completely different with Sophia under a fairly strong assumption.\n\n- Further studies are required to show if Sophia's speedup still exists on real large language models with billions of parameters and models other than GPT. See Questions for more discussion on this point."

Here are several questions for clarification and further improvement.\n\n- The authors mention that there is an efficient implementation in PyTorch and JAX for Hessian-vector product. What is the actual computational cost of this Hessian-vector product, compared with the computation of the (stochastic) gradient?\n\n- Does the 2x speedup still exist when considering larger models typically with billions of parameters? Can authors add more explanation for Figure 10? I am also curious about the performance of Sophia on other models like LLaMA and BERT.\n\n- This question might be a little beyond the scope of this work. Does Sophia still work well on other tasks beyond pre-training, such as fine-tuning? Can the authors provide some comment on this?"

                        "value": "Thanks for the feedback! We address questions below:\n\n**Q1:** What is the actual computational cost of this Hessian-vector product, compared with the computation of the (stochastic) gradient?\n\n\n> **Response**: In practice, we observe that on a 1.5B model a Hessian-vector product with batchsize=64 costs approximately the same time as a stochastic gradient with batchsize=480. \n\n\n\n\n**Q2:** Does the 2x speedup still exist when considering larger models typically with billions of parameters?\n\n\n> **Response**: So far 1.5B and 6.6B GPT NeoX are the largest models which we have resources to run. We still observe 2x speedup of Sophia over Adam on the 1.5B model, but we still need more time and compute to complete the 6.6B run with more steps.\n\n\n**Q3:** Can authors add more explanation for Figure 10?\n\n\n> **Response**: We only carried two runs for AdamW and one run for Sophia on the 6.6B model. For AdamW, we tried peak learning rate 1.2e-4 (black solid curve) and 1.5e-4 (black dashed curve). The loss of the 1.5e-4 run blew up at about 17K steps. This indicates that 1.2e-4 is close to the largest peak learning rate for AdamW in that setup. Note that with the unstable 1.5e-4 learning rate, AdamW is slower than Sophia-G before blowing up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Q4:** I am also curious about the performance of Sophia on other models like LLaMA and BERT.\n\n\n> **Response**: We provide results of mask language modeling with BERT in the table below. In terms of validation pre-training loss, Sophia is better than AdamW and Lion with less than 70% compute spent. We will provide results on T5 and contrastive pre-training in the next version.\n\n\n| Method  | Steps | Validation loss |\n| -------- | ------- | ------- |\n| Lion | 38400 | 1.620 |\n| AdamW | 38400 | 1.638 |\n| Sophia | 25600 | 1.605 |"

The paper focuses on two instantiations: Sophia-H and Sophia-G. In each algorithm, the second-order information comes from an estimation of the Hessian diagonal, which is updated by the moving average of the gradients divided by the moving average of the estimated Hessian, followed by a novel element-wise clipping procedure. In extensive numerical experiments, Sophia outperformed Adam by a 2x speed-up, making Sophia the first second-order optimizer achieving a speed-up on decoder-only large language models in wall-clock time or total compute."

It is an interesting idea to use clipping to regularize the update size, in contrast to some prevalent choices like backtracking line-search. The method of updating the Hessian matrix, in which the matrix is updated every $k$ steps rather than every step, offers a tradeoff between Hessian estimation accuracy and computational cost. Moreover, Equation 10 provides a practical implementation of the GNB estimator. The paper also has extensive numerical experiments and some theoretical analysis, demonstrating the benefits of Sophia over other competitive methods. Furthermore, according to Figures 6 and 7, Sophia is insensitive to the choice of hyperparameters."

We will make this more prominent in the revision.\n\n\n**Q2:** How do you explain the success of Sophia? Is it due to regularization via gradient clipping?\n\n\n> **Response**: As demonstrated in the ablation study (Section 3.5), element-wise update clipping and the Hessian estimators are both reasons for Sophia's success. Compared to AdaHessian, the Hutchinson estimator in Sophia-H has a better denoising effect. Compared with empirical Fisher, label resampling (equation 8) makes the GNB estimator of Sophia-G an unbiased estimator of the Gauss-Newton term. Element-wise clipping allows infrequent updates of the diagonal Hessian, which reduces the overhead of computing second-order derivatives."

Sophia works by estimating the diagonal of the Hessian, and using it to precondition the gradient, in the family of Newton optimizers. The two main differences with previous similar work (Adahessian) are that Sophia applies per-parameter clipping to the Hessian to limit the effect of Hessian noise, and uses an exponential moving average (like Adam) to effectively compute diagonal Hessians over a larger batchsize, to reduce noise in the approximation.\n\nThe authors mention two methods to estimate the diagonal Hessian --- the standard Hutchinson method that uses Hessian-vector products, and a relatively new Gauss-Newton-Bartlett method that uses a second forward-backward pass. The latter produces better results in their experiments. To mitigate the extra time needed for the diagonal Hessian computations, they use the standard heuristic of computing the diagonal Hessian infrequently, they compute it once every 10 steps.\n\nThe authors test their method by training GPT2 models with up to 6.6B parameters, showing that Sophia is able to achieve significant savings over Adam, which is commonly used to train GPT models. They also show that the model trained with Sophia for the same number of steps gets better accuracy on downstream SuperGLUE tasks than the model trained by AdamW for the same number of steps."

Specifically, the techniques combined include: Hessian pre-conditioning of the gradient, coordinate-wise clipping of values in the update step, the use of the Gauss-Newton-Bartlett estimator for the Hessian's diagonal entries (justified by previous works the authors cite), and the idea of performing approximate computations each time and more correct computations only periodically. While each of these techniques is itself quite classical, the paper's combination of these ideas to give a new algorithm that does quite well experimentally is very impressive."

This formulation in some sense interpolates between using a Newton step and using SignSGD based on the local geometry of the loss function, thereby choosing the \"right technique\" between these two and avoiding the other's disadvantages (for example, avoiding getting too slow under heterogeneous curvatures due to Adam and avoiding getting stuck at a local-non-minimum due to Newton). In order to achieve this goal, the authors come up with computationally light estimators of the diagonal entries of the Hessian. \n\nThrough their above innovation, the authors make *second-order* methods computationally tractable for pre-training LLMs, which is a big achievement."

                    "value": "Thank you for an overall interesting and nicely written paper. I'd be interested in understanding the following. \n\n**Question 1.** The theoretical analysis (Section E, F) of the submission seem to make assumptions of convexity and slow-changing Hessian on the loss function. This, to me, seems somewhat at odds with the motivation for the key novelty of the algorithm, which is to clip the value of the positively clipped Hessian (from my understanding, based on Page 3, \"Limitations of Newton's method\" paragraph, it looks like the role of the clipped Hessian is precisely to \"mitigate the rapid change of Hessian\" and be less \"vulnerable to negative curvature\" (cf. Section 2.2)). From this, it seems to me that the theory in Sections E and F are perhaps justifying only the gradient clipping, not the clipping under nonconvexity or negative-curvature-Hessian. Do the authors have any additional theory for the algorithm when the loss is nonconvex and/or when the Hessian has a negative curvature or is rapidly changing? This would, in my opinion, truly complement what's in the experiments and greatly strengthen the paper. \n\n**Question 2.** The authors mention that their algorithm avoids local maxima and saddle points. My question is, would they be able to comment on what kind of local minima their algorithm converges to? Specifically, are these flat minima or sharp minima? Given that there has been a fair amount of work on the varying generalizability of these two types of minima, perhaps it might be important to understand this question so as to avoid overfitting.\n\n**Comment 1.** I found Figure 1 too small to see the details. Since the authors use this figure to explain much of the initial intuition, it would help to have it bigger. (I understand space is limited, so I'm definitely not penalizing this aspect; but perhaps there could be a bigger version of the same figure in the appendix, or perhaps the authors could use another visual medium to show the phenomenon of Fig. 1.) \n\n**Remark 1.** I would be happy to increase my score of \"Soundness\" and my \"Confidence\" were Q1 and Q2 to be satisfactorily answered. Regardless, I think this is a very good contribution to the ICLR community."

Do the authors have any additional theory for the algorithm when the loss is nonconvex and/or when the Hessian has a negative curvature or is rapidly changing?\n\n\n> **Response**: We agree that *Assumption E.2* requires the curvature to change at a reasonable rate. However, this assumption contains natural cases which do not satisfy the self-concordance assumptions [1] or bounded third-order derivatives assumptions [2] in Newton's method analysis. For example, $f(x) = \\log(1+e^x)-x/2$ is not self-concordant (when x goes to infinity) but satisfies *Assumption E.2*. When x is very large, the hessian of $f$ is very small, but the gradient is close to 1. Newton's method will overshoot, but with clipping Sophia is fine with this case. For decomposable nonconvex functions, we provide analysis in Appendix G of the revision. We leave analysis for more general non-convex functions to future work.\n\n\n[1] Boyd, S.

In language model pre-training, we typically have strict data deduplication and pass one data point only once. Therefore the training loss and validation loss are almost the same and we are not overfitting training data.
