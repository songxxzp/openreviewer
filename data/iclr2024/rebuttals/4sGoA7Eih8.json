It is unclear in which scenario the attacker can access the attention weights and the output of the attention layer.\n\n3. This paper does not involve a non-linear activation layer (e.g., ReLU), which is widely applied to transformers into discussion, which should introduce challenges to invert the input perfectly."

Lack of Empirical Results: The paper's focus on theoretical analysis is essential for establishing a foundational understanding before conducting empirical tests. Theoretical research often precedes empirical validation, especially in security-focused studies. This theoretical groundwork is a precursor for future studies to empirically evaluate and extend these findings. \n2. Access to Attention Weights and Outputs: The study explores theoretical scenarios to highlight potential vulnerabilities, not necessarily specific real-world situations. It aims to illustrate a possible weakness to prompt further safeguarding research. \n3. Exclusion of Non-linear Activation Layer: Omitting non-linear activation layers like ReLU is for theoretical clarity, focusing on core concepts without the complexity of non-linear transformations. This limitation points to an area for future research, incorporating non-linear layers to provide a comprehensive view of the vulnerabilities in more complex scenarios."

Lack of Empirical Evaluation: The paper's focus on theoretical analysis is a critical first step, laying groundwork essential for future empirical testing. Theoretical research in areas like cryptography and data security often precedes and guides empirical studies. The insights provided set the stage for subsequent empirical evaluations. Theoretical models help formulate hypotheses and testing methods for practical experiments.\n2. Overhead of Proposed Attack Not Discussed: The primary aim is to explore the theoretical feasibility of data recovery in transformer models. Discussion of computation overhead might be outside the initial theoretical scope, but can be addressed in future empirical studies. Theoretical models in deep learning, especially those concerning security, often deal with complex mathematical frameworks. In such cases, the initial focus tends to be on the feasibility and integrity of the conceptual model rather than immediate practical concerns like computation overhead. Once the theoretical model is established and validated, subsequent research can more effectively address practical aspects such as computational efficiency and overhead."

This paper does not explain what are the challenges of solving this optimization problem and how to overcome these challenges.\n\n5. Given the weight and output, the input can also be found by black-box attacks where a network is constructed to do model inversion. This paper lacks comparing with such black-box attacks."

Lack of Empirical Evaluation: The paper provides a theoretical foundation which is a crucial first step before empirical evaluation. Theoretical models often precede and guide empirical research, especially in fields like cryptography and data security. \n2. Unnumbered Equations: While numbering equations is a standard practice for ease of reference, the content and implications of the equations hold more substantial value. The clarity of the equations themselves and their integration into the paper\u2019s narrative is more critical for understanding. We did provide numbers for the equations which are referred in the context. But for simplicity, we didn't number the ones which are not referred. \n3. Undefined Symbols: We apologies for the missing explanation. Here we use $A \\mathbf{1}_n$ to denote the matrix product of matrix $A$ and all-one vector $\\mathbf{1}_n$. \n4. Optimization Challenge and Gradient Descent: While gradient descent is a standard optimization technique, its application depends on the problem's nature. The paper's focus on transformer models and attention weights may involve complexities beyond straightforward gradient descent optimization, such as non-convexity or high-dimensionality. \n5. Comparison with Black-box Attacks: The paper's focus is on a specific theoretical aspect of transformer models. While comparing with black-box attacks is valuable, it might be outside this study's scope. Such comparisons could be considered in future empirical studies that build on this theoretical foundation."

However, I believe that the paper falls short of the standards expected for ICLR due to its lack of experimental evidence and the writing quality that doesn't meet the expected standards. As a result, I will maintain my current score.\n\nFor future resubmissions, I would like to offer the following suggestions to strengthen the paper:\n\n1. Clarify the Threat Model: The abstract and the initial sections of the background (pages 1-2) seem to imply that the paper focuses on recovering inference input. However, it later appears that the actual target is the training data. Clarifying this aspect early in the paper would greatly enhance reader comprehension.\n\n2. Detailed Analysis of Optimization Challenges: Please provide a more in-depth discussion of the optimization challenges encountered. This should be complemented with experimental results that demonstrate how your method addresses these challenges effectively.\n\n3. Demonstrate Versatility Across Model Sizes: To showcase the robustness of your approach, consider applying your attack strategies to both smaller models and larger models like BERT_base and BERT_large. This would help in illustrating the strength and scalability of your proposed methods."
