Based on gradient perspective, the authors prove KL divergence can be decomposed into weighted Mean Square Error (wMSE) and Cross Entropy loss with soft labels. Then, the authors propose two improvements by i) breaking the asymmetric property by allowing the gradient back-propagation through student in wMSE loss and ii) introducing the global information by substituting the individual-wise weights samples by class-wise weights in wMSE to mitigate the bias of per-sample. Experiments with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets on adversarial robustness and knowledge distillation to support the claims."

Do the authors need to keep the gradient stopping on the teacher\u2019s outputs in wMSE like in Eq. 7?\n\nI am curious regarding the nature of asymmetries of KL divergence. Instead of improving by breaking this why don\u2019t just use Jensen Shannon divergence instead? \n\nAlso, it would be beneficial to provide experiments from where to motivate the authors to figure out the weakness of the symmetric breaking? \n\nTable 1 does not show GI plays an important role as it is only shown when combined with BA. What happens if GI is enabled alone? It would be beneficial to study this option as well to support the claim. This study is on AT, it would be beneficial to investigate for KD as well.\n\nThe experiments are not well-written when it does not provide sufficient information for understanding the experiments from the beginning.  In the first analysis of GI, what is IKL, IKL-AT? Why IKL-based methods and TRADES used for the experiments. They should be discussed in a bit more detail before the analysis. I just realized IKL-AT and IKL-KD are the same method applied for two different problems only when reading to the end. It would be beneficial that authors provide more details on comprehending the Fig. 2a? What TRADES play a role here? Would be good to refer the names of baseline methods such as LBGAT, AWP, etc into original papers to follow more easily.\n\nWhat is the difference between KD and DKD in Table 5, why do the results are different as in theory they are equivalent?"

I am confused about this. As the KL Divergence loss is not new, many topics use this loss. Why there is no study for this loss?\n- Could the paper detail the claim that its gradient optimization is asymmetric?\n- Figure 1 is not very informative. From this figure, the issue of asymmetric gradient optimization is not reflected. \n- This paper mainly studies the property of KL loss. Adv. robustness can be seen as an application. I am confused about why this paper reviews lots of works on adv. robustness. It seems that these works are not very related to the core content of this work. \n- Could the paper provide a formal definition of stop gradients operation? It will help readers understand the theoretical analysis more clearly. Also, could the paper provide some intuitions on how to analyze the loss form but with gradient information?\n- Potentially, could the modified robust loss function break the previous nice character of KL loss?\n- The difference between Figure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) is not very clear. Also, the improvement brought by the proposed method is marginal in lots of cases. Besides, the use of the proposed method may bring side effects on final performance, which is worrying. \n- Could the proposed method of this paper be applied to the SOTA KD methods for better performance? The experiments about current baselines are not very convincing."
