I would also more clearly define the v indices as they are used throughout the paper.\n\nFigure 3 is extremely helpful for understanding the equation below equation 10 -- I was unable to understand the equation without it. I know it takes up a huge amount of space, but even the second order version of the diagram would really help the reader parse the equation. I would prioritize Figure 3 over Figure 2."

As I understand, the primary contribution of PACE, as compared to MACE, is the introduction of self-interaction layers that map the atomic base $A_i$ to different subspaces for different body orders, thereby increasing expressive power of PACE. However, the paper lacks an ablation study directly analyzing the significance of this operation. Although MACE could be considered a natural ablative baseline, it's unclear whether the two models share the same hyper-parameters, such as those mentioned in Table 5. I recommend that the authors conduct a direct ablation experiment to clarify this point."

Below are our responses to your concerns and questions. \n\n**W1.** Thank you for suggesting the direct ablation experiment. During the discussion period, we conducted this ablation experiment on three molecules from rMD17, and the comparison is shown below. In this experiment, we removed additional self-interaction operations and used the same hyperparameters. The results confirm the effectiveness of our polynomial many-body interaction module. We have added this ablation experiment to Appendix D3 in the revised paper.\n\n|         |   | PACE (-SI) | PACE |\n|---------|---|------------|------|\n| Ethanol | E | 0.4        | **0.3**  |\n|         | F | 2.3        | **2.0**  |\n| Toluene | E | **0.2**        | **0.2**  |\n|         | F | 1.4        | **1.2**  |\n| Uracil  | E | **0.3**        | **0.3**  |\n|         | F | 2.3        | **2.0**  |\n\n**Q1.** Thanks for pointing it out. In the revised paper, we have modified this sentence to the following expression.\n\u201cWhile TFN has the ability to approximate all equivariant polynomial functions with an infinite number of layers, the approximation capacity of a single TFN layer is limited, raising the need to develop modules improving the approximation capacity.\u201d\n\n**Q2.** Thanks for this question.  We wish to clarify that these architectures can achieve universal approximation to all equivariant polynomial functions up to the highest degree $D$, denoted as $\\mathcal{P}^{D}$. As shown in Table $1$, a single PACE layer can achieve $D=v=3$ in the experiment setup involving two layers, whereas a single NequIP can only reach $D=1$, and Allegro, with its three layers, attains $D=3$.\n\nWe appreciate it very much for your time and efforts to evaluate our paper! Hope our responses have properly addressed your concerns. \n\nBest regards,\n\nAuthors"

                    "value": "-  The improvement in the experiments is so marginal. Recent years, people [1] have already noticed that achieving a small energy and force error is only the first step towards a successful neural network force field. The advantage of a neural network force field should be judged on the prediction of macroscopic properties and sampling of conformations on a long-time large-scale molecular dynamic simulation. An improvement on the energy/force error does not necessarily lead to a better MD prediction, unless the improvement is very obvious. Based on the numbers shown in Table 2 and 3, as well as the limit of the datasets, I'm not convinced that the proposed model is a better model than the baselines. Also the proposed model is slower than MACE, making it more useless in applications.\n\n- The theoretical statement in this paper is not very important. Theorem 2 showed that the proposed polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate any polynomial equivariant functions. However, the goal of designing a neural network force field is to develop an end-to-end approximation to potential energy -- which is a non-polynomial equivariant function of the input coordinates. It is already proved that multi-layer perceptrons can already approximate any (polynomial or not) functions by the universal approximation theorem. So, no matter whether the polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate polynomial equivariant functions or not, the entire neural network is a universal approximator for any equivariant functions. This is why I think the value of Theorem 2 is limited."

                        "value": "Dear reviewer LgUR, thank you for your valuable comments! Below are our responses to your concerns and questions. \n\n**W1.** During the discussion period, we performed MD simulations using our PACE model on three molecules, Aspirin, Ethanol, and 3BPA. To compare the MD trajectories generated by PACE with those generated by our baseline MACE, we compute Wright's Factor (WF) [1] as a metric and present the comparison in the table below. Here, WF quantitatively measures the difference between the RDFs of the ground truth and the generated MD trajectories. For each method, we take the average of 5 MD simulations for 1000 timesteps with 5 different initial structures. \n\n|            |  MACE |      PACE |\n|------------|------:|----------:|\n| Aspirin    |  7.15 |  **6.88** |\n| Ethanol    | 19.16 | **16.86** |\n| 3BPA 300k  |  2.14 |  **1.98** |\n| 3BPA 600k  |  3.01 |  **3.00** |\n| 3BPA 1200k |  2.68 |  **2.40** |\n\nIn addition, we also visualize the radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the ground truth MD trajectories and PACE-generated MD trajectories, which can be found in Figure 5 in the revised paper. These results of the MD simulations further affirm that our PACE model not only achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in force field prediction but also holds practical value in realistic simulations.\n\nWe have added MD experiments to Appendix D2 in the revised paper. We agree that low energy and force errors do not guarantee better MD simulations. However, there\u2019s still a lack of standards to evaluate the complex MD simulations. Currently, energy and force errors are still the most common metrics to assess the ability of machine learning models to predict force fields [2].  We will consider developing machine learning models more specifically for realistic MD simulations in future works. \n\n**W2.** We wish to clarify that our proposed theoretical statement aims to provide a tool to analyze the equivariant networks from the perspective of approximating equivariant polynomial functions. There are three points we wish to emphasize.\n\n1. We wish to clarify that MLP is not an equivariant architecture. That\u2019s to say, a simple MLP doesn\u2019t satisfy the permutation, rotation and translation invariance or equivariance. Meanwhile, current 3D GNN architectures have shown these intrinsic symmetries are important when designing powerful practical model architectures. Therefore, the theoretical tool to analyze these invariant and equivariant architectures is important in our opinion. \n\n2. Second, we wish to clarify that designing equivariant layer with good ability to approximate the equviariant polynomial function is not an easy task. Although the reviewer mentions that \u201cno matter whether the polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate polynomial equivariant functions or not, the entire neural network is a universal approximator for any equivariant functions\u201d, we hold a different opinion. Without the theoretical guidance for constructing the polynomial many-body interaction module, designing an equivariant layer with guaranteed and high capability to approximate the equivariant polynomial functions is challenging.\n\n3. Finally, we wish to clarify that our proposed polynomial many-body interaction module in PACE can approximate any equivariant polynomial function with the highest degree $D=v=3$ with a single layer. Although the PACE layer needs more computational cost about 123% in training time and 127% in memory shown in Table $9$, we believe it is reasonable cost with carefully designed module under the guidance of obtaining the approximation capacity. Meanwhile, the final experimental performance is better.\n\n**Q1.** We performed an experiment on Ethanol to show how degree $v$ affects the error and cost. In this experiment, hyperparameters are the same. Results in the table below show that higher degree archives lower prediction errors while consuming longer training time and more memory. Due to the tradeoff between error and cost, $v=3$ is used in our PACE across all datasets. We have added this experiment to Appendix D3 in the revised paper.\n\n| Ethanol       |  v=1 |  v=2 |  v=3 | v=4 |\n|---------------|-----:|-----:|-----:|----:|\n| E             |  1.1 |  **0.3** |  **0.3** |   - |\n| F             |  6.5 |  2.3 |  **2.0** |   - |\n| Training time |   21 |   25 |   27 |   - |\n| Memory        | 1583 | 1653 | 2283 | OOM |\n\n[1].
