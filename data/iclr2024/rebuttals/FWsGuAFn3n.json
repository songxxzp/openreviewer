Compared to the existing methods, current model has two additional mechanisms: self prompting and exemplar prompting that aim to make model generate molecules that interact with the target pocket with higher affinity. To enable exemplar prompting, authors train a separate scoring model to predict binding affinity. The performance seems to reach the state of the art."

Besides, the model with prompting seems to work a bit better in terms of Vina scores, however, I would be interested in looking at the standard deviation of these scores."

                    "value": "Even though prompting sounds like a nice idea in general, the overall contribution of the current paper seems to me rather limited. Besides, the scope of application is quite unclear. Below I elaborate on these two main concerns and discuss several smaller issues:\n\n1. First of all, for me the scenario in which this model can be applied is not clear. Is it correct that PromptDiff can be used only for pockets that already have known binders? What if I want to generate a molecule for the pocket which has never been targeted before?\n\n2. Why cannot existing scoring methods be used for selecting prompts from the database? What is the reason for creating a new model for predicting binding affinity given that: (a) the proposed model does not seem to suggest any novelty compared to what has been done before, (b) it does not really outperform GraphDTA.\n\n3. In my opinion, the part about exemplar prompting is not clearly explained. Do you consider experimental data? Do you dock molecules to the target? Besides, how exactly do you create a database? Where do you take examples from?\n\n4. Abstract and introduction suggest that you focus on optimizing different molecular properties through prompting while in reality you aim to improve only binding affinity. While you mention synthesizability in the abstract and intro, there is no focus on it in the paper at all. Besides, SA scores of PromptDiff samples are very mediocre. I would suggest to change the wording or to explain better how synthesizability can be addressed by your model and support it by experiments.\n\n5. Algorithm 1, line 1: I did not find the explanation of the sampling procedure of your method in Section 3."

                    "value": "1. How do train/test sets for PMINet and PromptDiff correspond?\n\n2. Are notations $\\mathcal{M}$ and $\\boldsymbol{M}=[\\boldsymbol{X}, \\boldsymbol{V}]$ interchangeable? What's the reason to use different ones?\n\n3. It seems strange for me that adding self-prompting results in degradation of the average Vina score in Table 3. Did you investigate this issue?\n\n4. \"_We randomly choose 128 ligands from training set for retrieval, and select the ligand of top-1 predicted binding affinity as prompt for each protein_\" \u2013 is it 128 random different ligands that you use for all your samples or is it 128 ligands bound to the same pocket? Could you please explain this procedure in more detail?\n\n5. How do you sample initial atom types?\n\n6. What is the difference between self-conditioning [1] and your self-prompting?\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. Would be interesting to look at a couple of case studies where one or multiple active compounds are known. How does PromptDiff perform there? Do samples share some parts with these compounds? What are scores of those?\n\n2. Suggested scoring model can be used to score samples so that you get the ranked list of samples.\n\n[1] Chen, T., Zhang, R., & Hinton, G. (2022).

It is reasonable to expect that the use of exemplars with high binding affinity as prompts may be more efficient than designing ligands from scratch and also may effectively steer the diffusion-based molecular generation process to make the generated molecules possess high binding affinity against the given protein target.\nHowever, one concern regarding such an approach is its impact on the diversity of the generated molecules.\nInterestingly, the authors show that PromptDiff is capable of enhancing/maintaining molecular diversity compared with other diffusion-based methods and many other non-diffusion schemes.\nBut it is not intuitive why that's the case, and it warrants further investigation and discussion about this aspect.\n\n2. An interesting question - also somewhat relevant to the \"diversity\" of the molecules generated by using exemplar prompting - is how the generated molecules would perform if the original database lacks molecules with high binding affinity.\nEven in such scenarios, would PromptDiff be capable of generating diverse molecules such that the generated molecules would include ligands with high binding affinity to the protein targets?\nWould the performance of PromptDiff still outperform other techniques that do not use such exemplar prompting?\n\n3. In the evaluation results, how were the \"reference molecules\" selected?\nPlease clarify, as this is not clearly described in the current manusscript.\nAlso at leat brief define (with proper citations) how QED, SA, Diversity metrics were evaluated, since there exist different schemes/tools for this purpose.\n\n4. Since PromptDiff mainly aims to generate molecules with enhanced binding affinity to the target proteins, is the fact that it also enhances some other properties compared to other approaches simply a (somewhat unexpected) by product of the proposed diffusion-based generation scheme?\nOr would one expect to similar outcomes for various other molecular optimization tasks/scenarios in general?\nPlease share relevant insights/intuition (if any).\n\n5. In the ablation study, the paper discusses the impact of applying promopting without the pre-trained PMINet.\nWhat conclusions can be drawn regarding the (relative) importance/efficacy of prompting using \"good exemplars\" vs. the use of the learned ligand-protein interactions captured in the interaction layer of PMINet (used in self-prompting)?\n\n6. It appears that results in Table 4 are somewhat limited to draw a reliable conclusion (especially so for k).\nThere is no discussion regarding the impact of T.\nFurthermore, the impact of these hyperparameters on the overall computational cost should be discussed.\n\n7. Considering that multi-objective optimization is commonly required for molecular design, it is important to discuss how the proposed scheme would extend to the case when multiple molecular properties need to be optimized simualtaneously."

This method uses pre-trained binding affinity signals and exemplar prompting and self-prompting techniques to generate ligands. Empirical results show improvement of generating drugs with high binding affinity."

The paper would benefit more if the author could explain the insights behind choosing prompting and diffusion models as the main method.  \n\n2. The pipeline has several steps, retrieving and prompting. How each step affects the molecules is not clear. For example, a model is easily affected by the selection of retrieved molecules, but the model is robust to selecting top-1 affinity molecules. This part of the argument is not inconsistent and needs empirical evidence."
