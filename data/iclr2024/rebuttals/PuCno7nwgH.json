The authors first compare existing methodologies based on 1) one-hot-encoding of binary features for the entities, 2) creation of nodes representing an attribute linked to entities possessing the attribute and 3) creation of hyperedge between any entities sharing the same attribute. Then, they proposed a new model where categorical attributes were handled as hyperedges."

The proposed method considers only two specific attributes, i.e., price and category, which makes the model less generalizable. It could be better if the proposed method describes how it will deal with general single attributes and multiple attributes (e.g., will it be better if we model some combinations of attributes?).\n3. Code is not available, making it difficult to reproduce the work in the reviewing phase.\n4. The paper lacks robustness in its experimental validation, as there is no evidence of repeated experiments or statistical tests such as paired t-tests, which are crucial for ensuring the reliability of the results.\n5.

Differently from previous similar approaches in the literature, the authors do not address the task of session recommendation, which is the main scenario where categorical information is usually injected in recommendation. Specifically, the paper introduces three possible variants of graph-based recommender systems exploiting the categorical information, namely: 1) one-hot encoding of the categorical information as items\u2019 node features, 2) tripartite graphs where categories represent another type of nodes besides users and items, and 3) items\u2019 categories regarded as hyperedges. The authors\u2019 proposal involves the latter setting, where a neighborhood and hyperedge aggregation are performed through a GCN layer and a UniSAGE aggregation, respectively. Finally, the loss function is the common Bayesian personalized ranking one (i.e., BPR). The proposed approach is tested against three GCN architectures having: 1) no categorical information, 2) category information as extra nodes in the graph, and 3) category information as extension of the node features. The evaluation is run on three popular recommendation datasets which include two types of category accounting for either the products\u2019 price or category or both. Results on all such settings demonstrate the efficacy of the hyperedge-based solution, whose trends are further confirmed by evaluating the proposed model against similar state-of-the-art recommendation approaches."

I'll comment on your answers regarding my outlined weaknesses and questions.\n\n- **Novelty.** The points you outlined are now sufficient to justify the novelty of the proposed approach. Thank you.\n- **Top-k evaluation.** Despite it would have been useful to actually take a look at the top-10/20 results (maybe you might include them in the appendix) it is reasonable that you used top-50/100 evaluation to be coherent with one of the baselines.\n- **Code sharing.** Thank you for the clarification, but I'm still convinced the code would have been useful at review time to better assess the implementation of your model and check on the reproducibility. In case of acceptance, please make sure to include it in the final publication.\n\nIn the light of above, I'll raise the rating for the paper to a weak acceptance."
