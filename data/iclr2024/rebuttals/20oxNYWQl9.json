Compared with other approaches, the approach is query efficient because it only needs k inferences from the model. Several experiments are performed to verify the validity of the approach."

                    "value": "1. The Holder continuity assumption lacks empirical support. Does the dataset really satisfy the assumption? It would be better to perform experiments to verify it.\n2. The paper lacks comparison with previous works, both theoretically and empirically. \n    \n   Theoretically, the proposed method can find a 1/a^2-size coreset with k query to the model, with (1+a) multiplicative error and an additive term, under the Holder continuity assumption. What are the assumptions in previous works? How large is the coreset in previous works? How many are the queries of previous works? I can't find explicit comparisons. It would be better to add a table to list them. \n    \n   Empirically, there is only one compared method [1], which is published in 2018. It seems there are several methods for coreset after 2018, as listed in the related work. But there is no comparison with them.\n3. It seems there are some errors in the proof and algorithm. \n    \n   a. By using Holder continuity of $l$, you obtain that $l(e)\\leq \\hat{l}(e)+\\lambda v(e)$, where $v(e)$ is defined as $||e-A(e)||^z$. It seems $e$ and $A(e)$ belong to the sample space. But the Holder continuity needs that $e$ and $A(e)$ belong to the embedding space. To satisfy the Holder continuity, $v(e)$ should be $||v_e-v_{A(e)}||^z$, where $v_x$ stands for the embedding of $x$. There should be some modifications in proof and algorithm.\n    \n   b. It seems that the expectation of $X_i$ (defined in Appendix B.2) is $\\sum l(e)w(e)p(e)=\\sum l(e)/s$. Therefore, by using Bernstein\u2019s inequality, $|\\sum l(e)/s-\\sum w(e)l(e)|$ is bounded, rather than $|\\sum l(e)-\\sum w(e)l(e)|$.\n4. There is an extra time cost to obtain the embedding for each sample, which may take about the same amount of time as inference.  Although query efficient, the total time cost may be similar with previous works.\n\n\n[1] Ozan Sener and Silvio Savarese. Active learning for convolutional neural networks: A core-set approach."

Most prior work either uses very indirect model information (updated embeddings like [1], no use of margin or loss scores), or model information for all the input elements (such as margin scores). Our idea was to provide comparison with the two other extreme methods (indirect information vs information for all elements).\nIt seems that none of the other methods would provide comparison in the mixed model."

Indeed, in many cases, one can obtain generic embeddings that would be good enough. One may for example think of BERT embeddings for text applications. Of course the model embeddings could be more refined but elements that are similar under generic embeddings such as BERT should hopefully be similar in the model embeddings too."

Can you elaborate on this?\n\n* Can you put time graphs concerning Figure 1 to further highlight the speed gain one would enjoy when using your approach as opposed to using the leverage score sampling technique?\n\n* In the neural network experiments:\n  * How many epochs were used to train the uniformly sampled points of size $k^\\prime$?\n  * Can you put the runtime for uniform sampling coreset in Figure 2 (a) for better comparison?\n  * In Figure 4, it was stated \"independently run each data point 100 times\", did you mean you ran the experiment 100 times with different sampled sets? If not, then please elaborate.\n   * Also concerning Figure 4, can you put the running times to highlight the advantages of your approach better -- while margin is the best, it does require the most time (due to the inference payload it has to pay)."

Thanks a lot for the remark, we will incorporate it into the draft. In particular, the $k$-median objective is similar to the median, which is robust to corruption of 50\\% of the dataset ; while $k$-means is much more sensitive to outliers, and $k$-center even worse. Note that the result of Sener and Savarese uses the k-center objective and this may be a reason why we are also able to improve upon their work."

Their method involves computing approximate k-means or k-median clusters over a dataset, and selecting data points based on a modified sensitivity sampling method, where each point is chosen with probability proportional to its distance from the centers and the loss associated with the center. Their results differ from previous methods because they study a class of losses more general than Lipschitz functions, but a subset of Holder continuous functions. \n\nTheir main theoretical contribution lies in showing that with constant probability, the weighted loss on their proposed coreset closely approximates the loss on the entire dataset, with an additive error dependent on the cost of clustering the data.\n\nThey provide experiments where they compare their method to existing sampling techniques like uniform sampling, leverage score sampling, other clustering based methods for tasks like linear regression and training neural networks on datasets, including gas sensors and CIFAR."

It would be good to have a detailed explanation for the assumption 10 that requires for any $i,j$ $| b_i - b_j | \\le ||a_i - a_j||_2$. \n\n* It seems that their primary theoretical contribution revolves around the use of Holder-continuous loss functions; however, their experiments do not seem to leverage this property.\n\n* This paper as a whole is not reader friendly and requires significant time commitment because of imprecise definitions, lack of explanations and inconsistent terminology. For example, Algorithms 1 and 2 are never referred. The definition of $\\mathcal{A}$ from the first lines of both algorithms is not properly stated and it is also overloaded $\\mathcal{A}(e)$. Is it defined as $\\mathcal{A}(\\mathcal{D}) := \\min_{|C| = k} C' \\cdot \\Phi_z(\\mathcal{D},C)$ for some constant $C'$? In the clustering objective $C$ is not defined correctly where $|C| = k$ and $C \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. There is also inconsistency in using norms, somewhere $||\\cdot||$ or $||\\cdot||_2$ is used. $\\Delta$ is mentioned in section 3.1 without definition. Overall I recommend a better use of space for defining variables as opposed to other sections like stating Berstein's inequality. \n\n Given these questions, their overall contribution appears reasonable in terms of the empirical study of their proposed algorithm, but the theoretical contribution is lacking."

The framework we focus on is much crisper, only relying on the Holder-continuity (which we show holds in practice) and so we can obtain sampling algorithms that are both simpler and achieve better results in practice. Thus, we believe that the new theoretical framework we provide is a new framework for developing algorithms with theoretical guarantees."

Sampling and reweighing the sampled points appropriately, gives you a subset which can approximate the loss over the full data with an additive error proportional to the clustering cost. The authors specifically show the theoretical guarantees of the algorithm for the case of linear regression. Finally, they perform experiments to validate their claims comparing their sampling technique with uniform sampling and $k$- center based technique for the case of neural networks and leverage scores for regression problem."

The idea seems a combination of the one by Sener (2018) and results from coreset literature with only minor or incremental modifications.\n2. The paper title has sensitivity; however, the paper does not really use sensitivity as defined in literature. It appears to use a very crude approximation to sensitivity which is why there is an additive error. This idea also is very similar to the one of \"light weight coresets\".\n3. The additive error can be pretty large I believe. \n4. The proofs are pretty straight forward (not a bad thing in itself); however, it means even proof technique wise there is not much contribution. For e.g., the proof of theorem 6 is direct application of Bernstein and is well known. The proof for the 1-round algorithm is also very similar to existing proofs.\n4. For regression, theoretical guarantees are much weaker than ones obtained using leverage scores. Empirically the authors claim they can match leverage score sampling in much less time. However, I could not find if they report the time for regression experiments.\n5. There are small writing errors as well. For e.g.: what is $X$ in theorem 1,7? In Algorithm 2 $x_0$ is mentioned in step 2 and computed in step 3.\nOverall, I think the authors need to clarify and highlight the contributions of the paper more and contrast them with existing results, especially in terms of novelty."

                        "value": "There is a drastic difference with the result of Sener and Savarese which lies in the fact that the approach considered there does not use any direct model information (such as loss, margin score, or gradient). The empirical success of methods such as margin or confidence sampling has shown that model-based data selection can achieve much higher quality results than model-agnostic selection. Our approach allows using model-based scores (e.g. loss) to improve selection quality, while maintaining the efficiency of coreset selection. As such, even in the era of foundation models and big datasets, our approach allows using a few model queries to obtain proxy estimates for margin, loss, or gradient that gives a better sampling procedure.\n\nOur experimental results agree with this intuition, since our approach yields samples of significantly improved quality compared to Sener and Savarese [SS18]. Moreover, Sener and Savarese also makes such an assumption Since H\u00f6lder-continuous for z=1 is equivalent to Lipschitz continuous, our assumption is weaker than that."

Moreover, the magnitude of this error relative to the actual loss depends on the Lipshitz constant, whenever this constant is of bounded magnitude, the error is bounded compared to the loss. \n\nWe ran further experiments and the Lipshitz constant for the MNIST dataset is 0.02. This implies that for this dataset, the additive term is not large compared to the total loss.\n\nMore importantly, we demonstrate in practice that this approximation provides competitive results, coming close to very efficient methods (such as margin score) at a much cheaper computational cost."
