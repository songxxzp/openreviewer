                    "value": "The paper introduces a novel model called DAGCN that aims to enhance aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) by effectively utilizing syntactic information from dependency trees. The document discusses the limitations of previous approaches and presents DAGCN as a solution. The model consists of two Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) - Aspect-oriented GCN (AoGCN) and Self-Attention GCN (SaGCN). AoGCN captures syntactic features by constructing a Distance-based Weighted Matrix (DWM) using Distance-based Syntactic Value (DSV) to measure the importance of context words, while SaGCN focuses on learning semantic information. DAGCN combines the DWM with Aspect-Fusion Attention (AF) to integrate local and global syntactic information. The two GCNs are designed to learn distinct features using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that DAGCN outperforms baseline models in ABSA."

The idea of leveraging syntax dependency features to assist in modeling long-range dependencies, thereby facilitating granular sentiment analysis, has already been extensively probed within the NLP community. This approach was well-addressed and effectively deployed in various NLP tasks such as Relation Extraction nearly 5-6 years ago.\n  \n2. The angle this paper pursues, namely that \"not all relations in a dependency tree are essential and different context words exert varied influences on aspects\", has been amply investigated by predecessors. Regrettably, the authors have not sufficiently covered this breadth of prior exploration in their literature survey.\n\n3. The methodology put forth lacks substantial novelty. The techniques exhibited are fundamentally simple amalgamations of those proposed half a decade ago.\n\n4. The experimental section of the work is somewhat underwhelming. The authors have not delved deep into analysis and exploration. Specifically, there's an evident gap in addressing how their proposed model tackles the challenge of discerning necessary relations in a dependency tree and understanding the diverse influence of context words on aspects."

Given that many of the explored themes have seen extensive examination in prior works, can the authors provide a more comprehensive survey detailing how their approach either complements or surpasses these earlier endeavors?\n\n3. Can the authors elucidate on their choice of methodology, specifically regarding its novelty, in the context of existing solutions introduced years prior?\n\n4. It would be beneficial for the readers if the authors could furnish deeper insights into how their model specifically addresses the challenges of discerning essential relations and gauging the varied influence of context words on aspects."

                    "value": "1. The motivation is unconvincing as several issues within the integration of dependency trees for aspect-based sentiment analysis have been fully explored: \n\n\ta. The claim that the \"attention mechanism is sensitive to noise\" lacks persuasiveness. It remains questionable how frequently occurring combinations in other sentences could significantly impact the attention mechanism within the current sentence. Furthermore, the absence of concrete examples or references weakens this argument.\n\n\tb. The assertion that existing GCN-based methods cannot distinguish the importance of words for aspects is unconvincing. Notably, the GAT-based method [1,2,3] has demonstrated the capability to assess the necessity and influence of relations within a dependency tree on aspects.\n\n\tc. There is also a lack of acknowledgment of several works [4,5,6] that have dedicated significant attention to leveraging global information to enhance aspect-based sentiment inference.\n\n2. It is paramount to question whether dependency trees are indeed the linchpin of aspect-based sentiment analysis, given that there exist various other methods that can significantly enhance task performance, such as the utilization of knowledge graphs [10] or generative models [9].\n\n3. Some pivotal and recent related works, such as [2,3,5,6], have been overlooked.\n\n4. The proposed method lacks novelty, as it essentially combines existing mechanisms, such as attention fusion [7,8], and aspect-oriented GCN [1].\n\n5.
