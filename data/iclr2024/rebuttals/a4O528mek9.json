It does not require modality-specific features and instead learns semantic representations. \nThe idea is that similar entities should have similar representations on both a contextual and semantic level, and Mul2vec aligns them and optimizes the semantic representations with the corresponding contextual representations. \nExperiments have demonstrated that Mul2vec is successful in acquiring semantic representations and can be utilized to enhance pre-trained models for downstream tasks with incomplete information."

Also, the I2T and T2I weren't explained. I suggest it be text-to-image retrieval.\n(2) The difference between contextual information and semantic information is not clear.\nWhy is the proposed model learning semantics? Does semantic refer to global information from the TF-IDF document information?\nFrom my understanding of Figure 1, semantics was learned by TF-IDF document-level information, which is a form of text-only information.\n(3) The main component of Neural Tensor Factorization was proposed in previous work [Wu et al. (2017)].\nAlso, the training objective of ILM and DLM was from previous works, which weakens the contribution of this work.\n(4) Although it claims to deal with missing modalities, it wasn't further explored by additional experiments (showing the effect of dealing with different levels of data missing, and the model is robust to it.)\n(5) In the experiment, as in tables 3 and 6, only the difference was presented in the table, which makes it hard for the reader to have a sense of whether the performance is good or bad."
