We appreciate your positive evaluation and have taken note of the specific points raised in your review.\n\n1. **Large Kernel Convolution:**\n   We want to express our gratitude for your insightful comments regarding the Large Kernel Convolution. The inspiration for incorporating this technique came from a series of works, including MetaFormer and ConvNext, which demonstrated the effectiveness of enlarging convolutional kernel sizes within transformer-like structures. This modification is part of our efforts to enhance the performance of Simplified SimCC, and our experiments have indeed validated its efficacy.\n\n2. **Heatmap Visualization:**\n   Regarding your suggestion on using heatmaps for analysis, we appreciate the suggestion. In fact, we did explore heatmap visualization in our experiments. However, it's important to note that SimCC differs from traditional heatmap-based methods, and in the case of Large Kernel Convolution, the feature maps received are not typical heatmaps. The convolutional layer here functions more like a spatial token mixer, making the visualization less interpretable compared to heatmap-based methods.\n\n3. **Device Selection:**\n   We appreciate your inquiry regarding the choice of devices. Our decision to use the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti GPU and Intel I7-11700 CPU was deliberate. Given the focus of our work on designing a lightweight pose estimation model for common industrial scenarios, we opted for lower-cost, industry-common devices. This choice ensures that our results are directly applicable and valuable for industrial deployment.\n\nWe are grateful for your positive rating and the confidence you have expressed in our work. Your thoughtful comments have provided valuable insights, and we believe that the clarifications and additional information provided address the concerns raised.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration."

We appreciate your constructive feedback, and we have taken several steps to address the concerns raised in your review.\n\n1. **Presentation Quality:**\n   We have thoroughly reviewed the presentation of the paper and addressed the identified issues, including typos and repetitive references. Notably, we have supplemented the definitions of symbols in Equations 1 and 2 to ensure clarity and precision in the academic context.\n\n2. **Contribution Clarification:**\n   - Our work originated from the identification of significant redundancies within the SimCC method (consuming 35\\% of parameters and 26.7\\% of computation while only gaining 0.8 AP). We believe that the simplification of the structure, as explored in our research, holds immense potential in the domain of lightweight pose estimation. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic analysis of five factors influencing real-time multi-person pose estimation and designed a comprehensive real-time pose estimation pipeline based on these insights.\n   - While we acknowledge that our proposed method integrates existing modules and training strategies, we believe we are the first to comprehensively address these factors in a single study, making a systematic contribution to the field of lightweight pose estimation. \n   - An important contribution of our work is challenging the prevailing stereotype in the academic community regarding top-down algorithmsWe understand that our innovation is more methodological than algorithmic, and we hope this perspective aligns with your expectations.\n\nWe appreciate your detailed feedback and are confident that these revisions significantly enhance the clarity and impact of our contributions. We look forward to any further guidance or suggestions you may have.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration."

Although experiments are extensively done, there is no interesting insight into the five factors, which seems hyper-parameter tuning to me. \nIn general, I don't think this paper is ready to be accepted."

We appreciate your constructive feedback and have carefully addressed the concerns raised in your review.\n\n1. **Presentation Quality**:\n    We have thoroughly reviewed the presentation of the paper and addressed the identified issues, including typos and repetitive references.\n\n2. **Contribution Refinement**:\n    In response to your comments on the contribution section, we have refined our statements to better highlight the unique aspects of our work:\n    - We have conducted simple yet insightful experiments to demonstrate the presence of redundant components in the SimCC method (consuming 35\\% of parameters and 26.7\\% of computation while only gaining 0.8 AP). The identification of these redundancies underscores the substantial potential for a simplified structure in the domain of lightweight pose estimation.\n    - An important contribution of our work is challenging the prevailing stereotype in the academic community regarding top-down algorithms. Contrary to the common belief that top-down algorithms sacrifice speed for accuracy, our research establishes that top-down approaches can achieve both high speed and precision, making them an optimal choice for industrial pose estimation algorithm design.\n    - Our paper provides a systematic analysis of the five aspects influencing real-time multi-person pose estimation. Additionally, we have designed a comprehensive real-time pose estimation pipeline based on this analysis.\n\nWe appreciate your insights and believe that these revisions significantly enhance the clarity and impact of our contributions. We are confident that the revised manuscript will address your concerns and provide a more compelling case for acceptance.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration."
