                    "value": "This paper proposed to suppress negative samples in SGMs. The negative samples are defined by a pre-defined binary oracle. The paper proposed to learn a classifier on positive and negative samples and used the classifier output as the guidance term in SGM. To use multiple classifiers for better invalidity, the paper proposed to distill them into a single model. \n\nThe paper evaluated their method on a toy example and two image tasks including a traffic scene generation task and a text-to-motion generation task. Results show that the proposed method achieved better invalidity than baseline diffusion models that did not optimize on this."

                "strengths": {
                    "value": "The major strength of this paper is that the proposed method is simple yet natural and effective. This makes it easy to understand and readers would tend to believe it will wrok. It leverages the advantages of several exsiting techniques: training a classifier from the oracle, using guidance to suppress negative samples, and distillation for better efficiency. \n\nAnother strength is the two downstream tasks do face the realistic negative-sample concerns, which further emphasizes the importance of suppressing negative samples."
                },
                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "One weakness is that there is no theoretical guarantee of the effectiveness of the proposed method. In practice the classifier is not perfect, leading to a bias in the guidance term. It is important to show that infraction can be upper bounded by a small constant if the learned classifier is near optimal. It is also vital to characterize differences for binary classifiers with different Lipschitz constants (i.e. whether the output changes slowerly vs drastically) near the decision boundary. One step further, it is useful to provide a sample complexity bound on the classifier accuracy given number of queries so that we could understand how many samples we need to query the oracle, as it can be expensive in certain tasks. \n\nAnother weakness is that there is an obvious tradeoff between infraction and generation quality (especially in the motion experiments), and the infraction rates are not near zero. The last row in table 1 is better than others, but the results can be more persuasive if the numbers are close to zero while the generation quality is similar. The results in table 2 show a considerable degradation of generation quality in compensation for some improvements on infraction. \n\nI'd also point out that some important related works are not discussed in this paper. The *Actively avoiding nonsense* paper by S. Hanneke et al (2018) is the first paper that introduced an active learning algorithm with the help of a validity oracle for suppressing negative samples in generative models. The *Negative data augmentation* paper by A. Sinha et al (2021) is the first paper that applied this idea to deep generative models. The *Safe latent diffusion* paper by P. Schramowski (2022) applied a similar guidance technique to avoid negative samples. The *Erasing concepts from diffusion models* paper by R. Gandikota (2023) first used distillation in this area for enhanced safety. All these works are very related to one or more core ideas proposed in this paper but none of them has been discussed. \n\nThere's a typo in table 1 last row."
