                    "value": "Well-structured and well-presented. However, I suspect that the result can be incremental: there have been a lot of results applying the PL inequality to get convergence of neural networks, e.g. [Nguyen & Mondelli, 2020] (which is not cited). Also, they do not really discuss the requirement \\alpha_1 > 0 much. It does not seem like a purely technical requirement. I suspect it might fail in reality, at least, sometimes.\n\nThe paper considers a general optimization problem for a two-layered linear network and aims to prove that GD converges to a minimum with a linear rate under some constraints on learning rate. Curiously, the learning rate can even increase throughout training.\n\nThe paper starts with a review of the classical linear convergence analysis for linear models by Polyak. This analysis stems on two ingredients: 1) Descent lemma, and 2) PL-inequality. However, neither PL-inequality, nor smoothness inequality which the Descent lemma is based on, cannot hold globally for a multi-layered linear model. The paper presents generalizations of both results with \"local\" smoothness constants. The local smoothness constants allow for bounds which are sufficient to derive linear convergence of GD under some (time-dependent) learning rate constraints.\n\nThe paper is very well-written. The first diagram is weird (and not really the way to do things... e.g. putting NTK in the 'finite step size' category is weird). \n\nThe paper contains no experimental validation for the main linear convergence result.\n\nQuestions: (1) Th.3.2 requires \\alpha_1 > 0; what is the probability for this requirement to fail for the standard [Glorot & Bengio, 2010] initialization? (2) How could we estimate \\eta_\\max? How small could it be? What does it depend on?"

                        "value": "To [7VmP], we thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments. We address the questions below.\n1. Verification of $\\alpha_1>0$. \nPlease see our response to all reviewers.\n2. Missing experimental validation for the linear convergence rate.\nPlease see Appendix G.2 where we numerically verify that Problem(2) trained via gradient descent achieves linear convergence under different choices of the hyperparameters. Moreover, we show numerically the theoretical upper bound follows the actual loss well.\n2. How to estimate \\eta_\\max? \nIn Appendix E, we show $\\eta_\\max=\\min(\\eta_0^{(1)}, \\eta_0^{(2)}, \\log(1+\\frac{\\alpha_1}{2\\alpha_2}))^{1/c}$. Thus, $\\eta_\\max$ depends on initial weights, $c, d, \\mu, K$, and $L(0)$. One can see that if $L(0), K, \\beta_2 $and $c, d$ increase or $\\mu, \\frac{\\alpha_1}{\\alpha_2}$ decrease, then $\\eta_\\max$ will decrease accordingly. To numerically solve for $\\eta_\\max$, one can use existing equation solver to solve eq(87) and eq(88) to get $\\eta_0^{(1)}, \\eta_0^{(2)}$. Then, $\\eta_\\max$ can be estimated by the minimum value by its definition.\n3. Novelty compared with existing literature. \nWe thank the reviewer for pointing us to these results (Nguyen et al., 2020; Radhakrishanan et al., 2020). We have added (Nguyen et al., 2020) in the \"Related Work\" section. In (Radhakrishanan et al., 2020), the authors study the convergence of autoencoder which is less relevant to our work. Thus, we won't cite it in the paper. We clarify the novelty of this work compared to existing results as follows. Existing results that study the convergence of deep linear networks (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a) or deep nonlinear networks (Nguyen et al., 2020; Du et al., 2018; Jacot et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2022; Lee et al., 2019) all make unrealistic assumptions. Specifically, the NTK analysis[1,5,6,7,8] is done under rather unrealistic assumptions such as extremely large width and large Gaussian initialization. Further, (Chizat et al., 2019) show that the performance of neural networks degrades when trained in the NTK regime, thus the NTK analysis does not capture the behavior of neural networks used in practice. On the other hand, (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a) focus on deep linear networks under the assumption that there is sufficient margin at initialization. This requires the initialization to be close to optimal, which is rarely seen in practice. Therefore, both lines of work make some unrealistic assumptions. The goal of our work is precisely to relax these unrealistic assumptions by considering general initializations with either sufficient margin or sufficient imbalance, which subsumes NTK initialization, mean-field initialization and spectral initialization. Moreover, our work assumes the width is larger than or equal to the input and output dimensions, which can be considered as a \"mild-overparameterization\" compared with the NTK analysis. Therefore, our work is an important stepping stone to analyzing deep networks of finite width under general initialization, which is not covered by existing results.\n\n[1]Nguyen, Quynh N., and Marco Mondelli. \"Global convergence of deep networks with one wide layer followed by pyramidal topology.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 11961-11972.\n\n[2]Radhakrishnan, Adityanarayanan, Mikhail Belkin, and Caroline Uhler. \"Overparameterized neural networks implement associative memory.\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 117.44 (2020): 27162-27170.\n\n[3]Arora, Sanjeev, et al. \"A convergence analysis of gradient descent for deep linear neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02281 (2018).\n\n[4]Du, Simon S., Wei Hu, and Jason D.

They introduce a new approach based on the Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz (PL) condition and Descent Lemma, demonstrating that these conditions hold locally with constants depending on the network's weights. By bounding these local constants related to initialization, current loss, and non-overparameterized model properties, the paper establishes a linear convergence rate for GD. Importantly, the study not only enhances previous results but also suggests an optimized step size choice, validated through numerical experiments. The authors further prove that local PL and smoothness constants can be uniformly bounded by specific properties of the non-overparameterized models. The paper concludes by proposing an adaptive step size scheme, accelerating convergence compared to a constant step size, and empirically validating the derived convergence rate's accuracy."

Incremental contribution compared with (Arora et al., 2018). \nWe respectfully disagree that our work is an incremental contribution compared with (Arora et al., 2018). In the work of (Arora et al., 2018), the authors provide the convergence rate of deep linear networks trained with gradient descent. While deep linear networks are indeed more general, (Arora et al., 2018) focus on deep linear networks under the assumption that there is sufficient margin and small imbalance at initialization. This requires the initialization to be close to optimal, which is rarely seen in practice. Moreover, standard Gaussian initialization, Xavier initialization, and He initialization all have large imbalance at initialization. Therefore, the convergence in (Arora et al., 2018) is proved under some unrealistic assumptions that cannot be satisfied by practical initialization schemes. The goal of our work is precisely to relax these unrealistic assumptions by considering general initialization with either sufficient margin or sufficient imbalance. Therefore, our work is an important stepping stone to analyzing deep networks of finite width under general initialization.\n2. Generalizability to deep linear networks.\nExtending the results of this work to deep linear networks trained via gradient descent is the next step, and the analysis can be done in the same spirit as it was done in this work. In the case of two-layer linear networks, we present a framework showing that one can use the imbalance and margin to bound the singular values of \\mathcal{T} during the training. In the case of deep linear networks, $\\mathcal{T}$ takes a different form depending on all layer weights which is more complicated than the two-layer case. On the other hand, we have $L-1$ imbalances for L-layer deep linear networks. As long as one can bound the $\\mathcal{T}$ for deep linear networks using $L-1$ imbalances and the margin, the convergence rate of deep linear networks is derived. We refer the reviewer to (Min et al., 2023) which proves the convergence of deep linear networks trained via gradient flow in a similar spirit as described above. \n3. Verification of $\\alpha_1>0$. \nPlease see our response to all reviewers.\n\n[1]Arora, Sanjeev, et al. \"A convergence analysis of gradient descent for deep linear neural networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.02281 (2018).\n\n[2] Min, H., Vidal, R. and Mallada, E., 2023.

Is Lemma 3.1 the main contribution of this work? \nWe respectfully disagree that Lemma 3.1 is the main (technical) contribution of this work compared with (Xu et al., 2023). The main technical contributions of this work consist of (a) a novel local smoothness inequality and Descent lemma (See Theorem 3.1), (b) a tighter convergence rate for overparametrized models with a general loss (See Theorem 3.2), and (b) novel spectral bounds for $\\mathcal{T}$ (See Lemma 3.1). Specifically, Theorem 3.1 presents a novel local Descent lemma and PL inequality of the overparametrized model to characterize the local rate of decrease, while prior results (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2023) are based on Descent lemma and PL inequality of the non-overparametrized model. In Appendix C, we show that Theorem 3.1 leads to a faster rate of decrease compared with the results in (Arora et al., 2018; Du et al., 2018a; Xu et al., 2023). Based on Theorem 3.1, it suffices to bound the singular values of \\mathcal{T} and W to derive the linear convergence of the overparametrized model. Lemma 3.1, which is the second main contribution of this work, shows when the step size satisfies certain constraints that allow the step sizes to grow during the training, one can present uniform spectral bounds for $\\mathcal{T}$ and W using the initial weights and initial step size. In (Xu et al., 2023), the authors show that the uniform spectral bounds not only depend on initial weights but also on some auxiliary constants $c_1, c_2$ under constant upper bound on the step sizes. Thus, the requirement in Lemma 3.1 admits a wider choice of the step sizes. Moreover, (Xu et al., 2023) show linear convergence under restrictive assumptions on $c_1$ and $c_2$, which leads to looser uniform spectral bounds on $\\mathcal{T}$ compared with this work. Finally, Theorem 3.2, which is based on Theorem 3.1 and Lemma 3.1, shows linear convergence of the adaptive step size scheme. In Appendix G, we numerically verify that the adaptive step size scheme proposed in this work is almost ten times faster than the one proposed in (Xu et al., 2023) and the backtracking line search.\n\n2. Significance of studying matrix factorization.\nPlease see our response to all reviewers.\n\n3. Improvement of the presentation of the prior work.\nWe thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We modified the \"Related Work\" section to highlight that (Xu et al., 2023) also designed an adaptive step size scheme to accelerate the convergence, and the convergence rate of the adaptive step size scheme heavily relies on two auxiliary constants which is a slower rate compared with this work.\n\n[1]Xu, Ziqing, et al. \"Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Finite Width Over-parametrized Linear Networks with General Initialization.\" International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics.
