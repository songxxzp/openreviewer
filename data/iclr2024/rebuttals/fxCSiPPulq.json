Masking might not shrink the actual model size, the activations and gradients of masked over still zero paddings in memory."

If authors could improve their experiments and provide more persuasive results,  I'll change my mind.\nFor instance, the model performance achieved by FedMAP looks divergence in both datasets, which can not support their convergence analysis. Authors may use IID FL FL settings to achieve convergences performance and further support their convergence analysis.\n\nAlso, as mentioned the post-training deployment, after FL training is finished, the submodels performance with different capacities should also been discussed in experiments sections."

And model sparsity? How does this work relate with centralized approaches aiming at finding subnetworks showing high performance e.g. [2][3]? \n- It is not clear how much FedMAP impacts the local computation on the resource-constrained devices w.r.t. more simple and standard baselines, e.g. FedAvg.\n- Necessary details for reproducing the results are not provided, e.g. local training hyperparameters, number of communication rounds, clients participation. Are the experiments run under partial or full clients\u2019 participation? How does FedMAP behave when faced with different levels of clients' participation?\n- To the best of my understanding, the experiments do not analyze the behavior of FedMAP when changing $\\gamma_i$, which measures the local available resources and is left constant across clients. This implies the results in Table 1 and 2 represent a simplified setting w.r.t. the one FedMAP was introduced for.\n- Limitations are not explicitly addressed. For instance, masking out some parts of the network may result in poor performance towards minority groups, with consequent fairness concerns. \n- Even if the presented results are promising, the experiments are not run on large-scale federated datasets (e.g., Landmarks-Users-160k, FEMNIST), they are limited to one single setting per dataset (e.g., partial vs full participation is not analyzed, as well as the impact of data heterogeneity on the results) and the comparison with the state of the art is limited.

                    "value": "1. Does FedMAP increase the communication cost between clients and server w.r.t. the baselines?\n2. How does the computation linked with FedMAP increase the computational local costs?\n3. Results are introduced on datasets partitioned according to the Dirichlet distribution with $\\alpha=0.3$. What happens when the scenario is more heavily heterogeneous (e.g., $\\alpha=0.1$)? And how does the behavior of FedMAP change when faced with homogeneous scenarios (i.e, $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$)?\n4. Do the authors have an intuition on why the submodel extraction does not achieve the best performance when handling the full model size?\n5. How is the proposed method affected by the distribution of $\\gamma_i$ across clients?\n6. Communication is a relevant aspect when deploying FL algorithms. How does FedMAP compare with the state of the art in terms of speed of convergence, i.e. number of rounds to reach a target accuracy?\n7. How does the masking process obtained with FedMAP compare with the other introduced approaches? How do the local subnetworks compare?"
