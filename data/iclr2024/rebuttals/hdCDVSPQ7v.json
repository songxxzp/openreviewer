They also show that the performance gains obtained from second order optimization continue to hold with the approximation."

Do you have some direct evidence of this (i.e. some illustration of the difference between the original preconditioners and the Jorge approximations)? \"\n\nWhile Jorge computes an approximation of Shampoo's preconditioner calculation, our experimental results, as illustrated in Figure 3 (left), demonstrate that it matches the sample efficiency of Shampoo. This provides empirical evidence supporting the sufficiency of our approximation in computing the preconditioners. We acknowledge the suggestion for a more fine-grained analysis, such as a direct comparison between the approximate and exact preconditioners, and we plan to incorporate this in our final manuscript to further strengthen this claim.\n\n> \"In most Shampoo implementations, the matrix roots are also computed via an iterative process that only involves matrix multiplications. How does your approximation compare with this process, for example by limiting the number of iterations to a fixed value?\"\n\nThe implementation of Shampoo we compared with [1] includes support for an iterative scheme known as the Coupled Inverse Newton's iteration. We acknowledge the importance of comparing Jorge's iteration times with this scheme, and we plan to incorporate this comparison in our final manuscript for a more comprehensive evaluation.\n\n> \"You say that (1 - b)/b X_L is chosen adaptively to ensure convergence of the Taylor approximation .. \"\n\nWhile a very low value of b can lead to gradients being forgotten quickly, we did not observe any convergence issues in any of our experiments (Figures 2 and 3). We agree that it might be useful to have a hyperparameter that serves as a lower bound on the value that our adaptive scheme can assign to b. \n\n> The equality on line -2 on page 4 is not valid: (A + B)^r =/= A^r (I + A^{-1} B)^r, unless A and B commute. Is there a way to fix the equation?\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. You are correct, and we appreciate your observation. The equality (A + B)^r =/= A^r (I + A^{-1} B)^r is valid only when A and B commute. We acknowledge this limitation and will make the necessary clarification.\n\n\n[1] Hao-Jun Michael Shi, Tsung-Hsien Lee, Shintaro Iwasaki, Jose Gallego-Posada, Zhijing Li, Kaushik Rangadurai, Dheevatsa Mudigere, and Michael Rabbat.

By having a point-to-point comparison with Shampoo (Alg 1 and 2), I can quickly understand how Jorge adapts Shampoo and how matrix inversion is avoided when applying pre-conditioning. \n\n**2**, Jorge reduces efforts for optimizing training hyperparameters. \n\nFinding training hyperparameters for second-order methods is a practical and important problem. The way Jorge learns hyperparameters (learning rate, weight decay, scheduler) is important to reduce overall training time, especially for large models. \n\n**3**, The evaluations cover different tasks.\n\nThe authors demonstrate the efficacy of Jorge on different tasks, which shows Jorge not only achieves faster convergence, but also gives comparable validation accuracy as SGD."

It is necessary to analyze the complexity of these additional matrix multiplications compared to matrix inversion in line 11 in Algorithm 1. \nI noticed the authors provide a wall-clock comparison between Jorge and Shampoo. However, it would be more insightful to have a theoretical complexity analysis. \n\n**2)**, It is unclear how accurate the approximation is. \n\nIn Eq(7), high-order items are removed. It is unclear how much error is introduced after the approximation. And importantly, how is the error propagated with Eq(4)? \nWhile it is impractical to analyze the approximation for highly non-convex NNs, it is possible to analyze in a simplified case, like simple convex functions. \nTherefore, I would suggest the authors do an analysis on the effectiveness of the approximation.\n\n**3)**, No convergence analysis.\n\nBesides empirical analysis, it is also important to analyze convergence and show how the approximation and related parameters affect the convergence speed. \n\n**2**, Comparison between Jorge and baseline methods needs further justification.\n\nIn experiments, the authors use step learning rate decay for Jorge, SGD, and Shampoo, but use a cosine decay for Adam. It is difficult to compare convergence speed with different learning rate schedulers. I understand different optimizers might prefer different schedulers. However, it would be more straightforward if compare optimizers with the same scheduler. \n\n**1)**, According to Table 2, AdamW achieves validation accuracy close to Jorge. However, there is no convergence plot like Figure 2 showing the convergence speed of Adam compared to Jorge. It would be great if the authors also provide such a plot in the paper.\n\n**3**, Lack of necessary ablation studies.\n\nIt would be good if the authors provide more ablation studies. \nFor instance, how does the preconditioner update frequency affect convergence and final model performance?\n\n**4**, Need more baselines.\n\nFor reducing the complexities of using second-order methods, optimizers such as K-FAC [1] and mL-BFGS [2] also target the same goal.

                    "value": "While the derivation of Jorge is interesting and the focus on GPU-friendly computations makes sense, the paper contains several causes for concerns.  I look forward to hearing the authors' replies to the following issues.\n\n# Comparison to other second-order solvers\nEvaluation to other related methods is limited, where only a single second-order optimizer is compared to.  The authors reference the recent SGD L-BFGS papers, but it should also be explained why these methods aren't compared to (i.e., implementations of these SGD L-BFGS have not been released).  However, the following second-order SGD optimizer should be compared to in the paper:\n- Yao, Zhewei, et al. \"Adahessian: An adaptive second order optimizer for machine learning.\" proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence. Vol. 35. No. 12. 2021.\n\n# Reported metrics, performance of/fair-comparison to AdamW\n> We borrow AdamW hyperparameters for the imagenet benchmarks from Heo et al. (2021).  The complete list of all hyperparameters used in this study can be found in Appendix A.6.\n\nFor ResNet50+Imagenet in the Heo et al. paper, both AdamW and SGD achieve ~76% accuracy, whereas in the current paper, AdamW saturates at ~70% (in Figure 2).  Furthermore, Figure 2 clearly shows SGD and Jorge benefiting from the authors decay schedule, which is not a fair comparison for AdamW (i.e., SGD is further well-tuned, while AdamW is not).  A fairer comparison for all methods would to use the same hyperparameters for both SGD and AdamW from Heo\tet al. (2021), while also determining the cause of performance loss for\tAdamW observed in this work.\n\nFurthermore, Jorge requires running SGD prior to each step (due to Jorge's use of grafting SGD).  However, Jorge reported runtime in Table\t3 is lower than\tSGD itself.  Thus, Jorge's reported timings seem inaccurate; because Jorge is dependent\ton grafting SGD, its runtime should reflect this.\n\n# Lack of Adam support and transformer architecture evaluations\nGiven the ubiquity and importance of transformer architectures used across applications (not only in NLP, but vision as well), Jorge's impact on transformer training should also be demonstrated.  A smaller issue is, similarly, Adam/AdamW is widely used, even for vision (e.g., vision transformers, ViT), and the inclusion of this optimizer for bootstrapping Jorge's hyperparameters is warranted for current deep learning."

                    "value": "- For Table 3, please include the (average) number of epochs required to achieve target performance.\n\n- > Interestingly, simply switching to the step decay schedule with 2 decay steps (reducing the learning rate by 10\u00d7 at each step) at one-third and two-thirds of the total training epochs (total epochs same as that of the tuned SGD baseline) resolves this issue\n\nNote that similar behavior and decay schedule was used in Zhang et al \"Lookahead Optimizer: k steps forward, 1 step back\".\n\n- > For example, SGD remains the optimizer of choice in computer vision due to its better final validation accuracy, even though Adam converges faster initially.\n\nThis is a very debatable claim, please revise.  In particular, Adam is widely used as the out-the-gate optimizer for vision transformers (e.g., ViT) as well as CLIP.  Furthermore, even in extensive benchmark studies, mixed results refute this statement, e.g., see:\nKumar, Ananya, et al. \"How to fine-tune vision models with sgd.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.09359 (2022)."

We agree that a more comprehensive evaluation involving a broader set of second-order optimizers is necessary. We plan to address this gap in our final draft by including comparisons with additional second-order optimizers like Adahessian and KAISA.\n\n> Concerns about AdamW\n\nWe will investigate why AdamW did not reach the target validation accuracy of 76% for ResNet50 with a batch size of 1024. Interestingly, we were able to reach 76% validation accuracy with AdamW with a batch size of 256 (Figure 3, left). We opted for the cosine learning rate schedule with AdamW based on the findings of its authors, who demonstrated its superior generalization compared to step decay and constant learning rate schedules [1]. \n\n> Furthermore, Jorge requires running SGD prior to each step (due to Jorge's use of grafting SGD). However, Jorge reported runtime in Table 3 is lower than SGD itself. \n\nIndeed, Jorge's per-iteration times may be slower than SGD due to the grafting process. However, Table 3 does not display per-iteration times; instead, it illustrates the total wall clock time for convergence. Notably, Jorge necessitates 25-40% fewer iterations than SGD to converge to a target validation metric, as illustrated in Figure 3. Consequently, the overall wall clock times are substantially smaller for Jorge, despite being slower on a per-iteration basis\n\n> Lack of Adam support and transformer architecture evaluations\n\nWe recognize the significance of showcasing Jorge's performance on transformer architectures, given their widespread application. To enhance the experimental section of our paper, we plan to include results on transformer architectures in the final manuscript. Moreover, considering the prevalent use of AdamW, particularly in transformer training, we intend to implement a bootstrapping strategy to derive hyperparameters from AdamW in our experimental evaluations.\n\nWe will include the epochs for convergence in Table 3, which can be inferred from Figure 3 as well.\n\nWe will adjust the claim regarding SGD being better than AdamW to be more nuanced and considerate.\n\n\n[1] Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization, Ilya Loshchilov, Frank Hutter"

We plan to include these in the final draft of our manuscript. \n\n> What is the update frequency used in Shampoo when comparing wall-clock time?\n\nIn line with Shi et al.

For example, for ResNet-50 on 16 GPUs (as shown in Table 4, row 1), setting Shampoo's update frequency to approximately 1500 would result in similar iteration times as Jorge with an update frequency of 50. However, it's crucial to note that such large update intervals for Shampoo may impact convergence significantly, as demonstrated by Anil et al.

[1] and Anil et al. [2], can indeed borrow certain hyperparameters from well-tuned first-order optimizers such as SGD and Adagrad. Our contribution lies in the specific insights we provide in the paper regarding the determination of optimal weight decay and learning schedules from SGD. As highlighted in our study, this process is nuanced and not straightforward, and our findings contribute to the understanding of how these hyperparameters can be effectively set for Jorge.\n\n> Is Jorge possible to apply to NLP tasks like LLM pertaining or fine-tuning?\n\nWe are currently actively investigating the applicability of Jorge to NLP tasks, including language model pretraining and fine-tuning.
