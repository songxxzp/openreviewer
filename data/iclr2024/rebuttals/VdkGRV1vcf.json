The paper initially presents the concept of \"Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels,\" which is essentially a sliced variation of MMD with Riesz Kernels. The paper demonstrates that Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels qualifies as a metric in the space of probability distributions, having non-negativity, symmetry, triangle inequality, and identity. Additionally, it establishes an equivalence between Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and the MMD with sliced Riesz Kernels. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the methodology for calculating Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and its gradient, showcasing that this approach achieves nearly linear complexity in relation to the support count of two discrete distributions. Lastly, the paper compares the proposed frameworks with other generative modeling techniques, such as NCSN, WGAN, MMD GAN, SIG, SWF, and more."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "- Concerning Theorem 2:\n\nTheorem 2 establishes bounds between MMD and Wasserstein distance of order 1. In my opinion, these results are not very sharp, and there appears to be an important missing reference here. Under the same assumptions of compact support, the article [1, Theorem 1] demonstrates that the Wasserstein distance $W_1$ is bounded by an MMD with the Coulomb kernel $k(x, y) = -|x - y|^{2-d}$ but without the power dependency of $1/(d+1)$. Since the measures are bounded, MMD with the Riesz kernel and the Coulomb kernel are related by a constant (dependent on the dimension) on the support of the measures. Therefore, it seems important to mention this result and discuss its relevance.\n\nIn a more general sense, I'm having trouble grasping the significance of these bounds for the current article. They don't appear to be entirely novel, and more importantly, they are not utilized subsequently, neither theoretically nor practically, nor in the discussion.\n\n- Regarding Theorem 3:\n\nTheorem 3 is the main contribution of this article, and I agree that it is interesting and significant. However, there is a minor point that needs clarification: while the function $E$ is shown to be differentiable everywhere in the proof, for the differentiability of $V$, the authors use an argument that doesn't seem rigorous. Indeed, the function $x \\to |x-y|$ is not differentiable at $x=y$. In practice, this may not be very important because this event is almost surely zero if the samples come from measures with densities. Still, it's important to note this limitation.\n\n- Regarding the dimension dependency:\n\nAn important aspect that is not detailed in the article is the dependence on dimension. Indeed, the sliced Riesz Kernel is not exactly equal to the Riesz kernel; it differs by a constant that depends on the dimension. As the dimension approaches infinity, this constant $c_{d,r}$ behaves as $O(d^{r/2})$, and thus the rescaled kernel tends to zero as $O(d^{-r/2})$. This suggests that estimating the gradient with a finite number of projections becomes increasingly challenging in high dimensions, as also observed in Figure 2 and the bound in $O(\\sqrt{d/P})$.\n\nThis point is not thoroughly discussed in the article. It would be interesting to visualize the relative error in the gradient not only as a function of the number of projections but also with respect to the dimension.\n\n\n- About training a sequence of neural networks (Section 4.2):\n\nI am having difficulty grasping the intuition behind the iterative training of neural networks $\\Phi_1, \\cdots, \\Phi_L$ to approximate the generation scheme. Why are these networks needed? Does the flow not work without them? What are the results without these networks on CIFAR10 or MNIST, for example?\n\nFurthermore, it seems to me that training a network per step is very costly; I doubt the feasibility of this method. Is this standard practice?\n\n- Regarding the \"related work\" section in the introduction:\n\nI believe that this section could be improved. The paragraph is somewhat confusing as it introduces a set of articles without providing clear context for the current work or establishing connections between the cited articles. As a result, I find this part to be not very illuminating for understanding the related work.\n\n\n- Additional remarks:\n\n  - Figures 1 and 2: The tables are not informative and hard to read. Since the information is already contained in the plots, I don't see the purpose of these tables. I suggest removing them and using the available space for more details on the points described earlier. Additionally, Figure 1 lacks a legend for the runtime (in ms?).\n\n  - The Riesz kernel also defines a valid MMD for $r=2$. So why restrict it to $r \\in (0,2)$ with 2 excluded?\n\n\n  - Unless I am mistaken, the result about $D_{K}$ as a metric on $P_{r/2}$ in (Modeste & Dombry, 2023) is not mentioned anywhere in the cited article. Can you provide more details on this fact or provide the correct reference ?\n\n  - I'm quite curious to know if the approach presented in the article can be generalized to the case of $r \\in (0,2]$? Particularly, the fast gradient computation.\n\n  - It seems that the reference (Numayer & Steidl, 20201, Lemma 3.3) is incorrect, or at least Lemma 3.3 doesn't state that the two MMDs coincide.\n\n- Refs: \n\n[1] Djalil Chafa\u00ef, A.

We answer to all of your comments separately.\n\n- Concerning Theorem 2: \nthe statement of Theorem 2 does not follow from a corresponding statement about the Coulomb kernel as we explain below.\nThe Coulomb kernel in Chafa\u00ef et al. is defined by $K_C(x,y)=\\\\|x-y\\\\|^{2-d}$ for $d\\ge3$ **without the minus**.\nTherefore, we cannot bound the Riesz kernel from below by the Coulomb kernel.\nMoreover, Thm 1.1 from Chafa\u00ef et al. assumes that $\\int\\int K_C(x,y)d \\mu(x)d \\mu(y)<\\infty$ and $\\int\\int K_C(x,y)d\\nu(x)d \\nu(y)<\\infty$.\nThis assumption is violated whenever $\\mu(\\\\{x\\\\})>0$ or $\\nu(\\\\{x\\\\})>0$ for any $x$.\nIn particular, this assumption excludes the case of empirical measures which is the most important one for our applications.\nNevertheless, since this is an interesting idea and since the bound looks similar at the first glance, we added a comment about that at the end of the proof of Theorem 2 in Appendix B. Even though we do not utilize this bound, we found the relations to the Wasserstein-1 distance quite interesting and would like to keep it in the paper. \n\n- Concerning the sharpness of the bounds in Theorem 2:\nWe do not think that a sharper version of Theorem 2 without the dimension scaling holds true for the following reason:\nIt is well-known that MMD has sample complexity $O(n^{-1/2})$ (Gretton et al. 2012) and Wasserstein-1 has a sample complexity of $O(n^{-1/d})$ (see e.g., Peyr\u00e9 and Cuturi, 2020). If it would hold true that $W_1(\\mu,\\nu)\\leq C\\mathcal D_K(\\mu,\\nu)$ for all $\\mu,\\nu$ this would imply that also Wasserstein-1 would have a sample complexity of $O(n^{-1/2})$ which is a contradiction.\nWe included a comment about that in the paper.\nFor the Coulomb kernel this argumentation does not apply, since it is not bounded on compact sets (which is an assumption for the sample complexity $O(n^{-1/2})$ for MMD) and since the result of Chafai et al. explicitly excludes empirical measures.\n\n- Regarding Theorem 3: Note that the potential energy $V$ is convex. \nConsequently, we can use subgradients instead of gradients. We added a comment on this in the paper after Theorem 3.\n\n- Regarding the dimension dependency: \nWe thank the reviewer for raising this point. The fact that $c_{d,r}\\in O(d^{r/2})$ is exactly the reason why the $\\sqrt{d}=d^{1/2}=d^{r/2}$ appears within the error bound for the gradients in Theorem 4, where $r=1$.\nWe already discussed the consequences in Remark 5. \nIn particular, this causes that the computational complexity for the estimation of gradients of the MMD up to a fixed error $\\epsilon$ via slicing depends quadratically on $d$ and not linearly.\nIn the updated version, we inserted comments after Theorem 1 and in Remark 5 in order to make this point more clear.\nMoreover, we inserted a plot with the approximation error on the right of Figure 1.\n\n- About training a sequence of neural networks (Section 4.2):\nWe train the networks for two reasons. \nFirst, the neural networks speed up the generation process and allow us to draw a single sample (for the particle flow, we always have to compute a batch of samples).\nThe second and more important reason is that the particle flow itself converges **exactly** to the training images, see Figure 9 and the corresponding explanation in the Appendix I of the paper for an illustration.\nIn some sense, we could say that the particle flow works \"too well\" since it approximates the discrete target measure exactly. The resulting FID of the flow particles would be 1.37 for MNIST, 1.90 for FashionMNIST and 3.90 for CIFAR10.\nIf we use the sequence of neural networks, we can interpolate between the training points in order to generalize the dataset. Finally, note that we do not train a network per step of the particle flow, but one network for 30000 steps of the flow after a warm start procedure. A detailed explanation towards this is given in Appendix H. Thus the training of the networks is not very costly compared to the simulation of the particle flow.\n\n- Regarding related work:\nWe agree that several references from the related work section were relevant for providing a broader context of the topic, but were not directly related to our paper. We moved these references to the general introduction and reorganized the related work section.\nWe hope that this makes it more clear now."

However it is not clear (and I am not sure I agree) why the assumptions of Chafa\u00ef \"exclude the case of empirical measures\". Unless I am missing something for any empirical measure $\\mu= \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i} \\delta_{x_i}$ where $x_i \\in \\Omega$ for compact $\\Omega$ then we have $\\int \\int K_C(x,y) d\\mu(x) d\\mu(y) < +\\infty$ and result from Chafa\u00ef applies. Also if all the distributions belong to some low-dim space we could have better sample complexity and the bound $W \\leq MMD$ without the dependence in $d$ (or with a better one) in the exponent (see for example Section 2.4 in [1])\n\nMy remaining point is the neural network strategy for learning the \u2018\u2018generative flow\". I am still doubting about this strategy, as it seems not standard. From my understanding of generative particle flows; when we have a discrepancy $F$ between probability distributions, to make a generative model what is usually done is something as computing a particle flow on $F(NN \\circ \\mu_Z, \\nu)$ where $\\mu_Z$ is a simple latent distribution and $NN$ a neural network. Then to sample you only have to generate from $\\mu_Z$. \n\nFor what I understand your strategy is to train NNs to approximate $T_l$ steps of the flow, so that the flow with these NN is not exact + it allows to generate for unseen point. Do you have any references that also use this strategy ? \n\nThe drawback I see is that the neural network could easily overfit the data so that the generated data are actually very similar to training data, thus causing a severe a memorization issue. It seems actually the case in Figure 8 where the generated samples are very similar to training points and not very diverse. Also as described in [2] just looking at nearest neighbors for assessing the diversity of the generated samples is not a very good option (the of only few different pixels can easily \u2018\u2018fool'' the Euclidean metric) so that I'm not really convinced by this Figure 8.\n\nAs you commented the FID scores are much smaller for the particle flows (so \u2018\u2018better scores\u2018\u2018 according to the FID), suggesting this memorization issue occurs for the particle flows. It is indeed known that FID score assign a very good score to a model which simply memorizes small samples from the true distribution [3]. But I really doubt that your approach with NN actually solves this issue, as there is no \u2018\u2018randomness'' involved in the model. \n\n[1] Controlling Wasserstein Distances by Kernel Norms with Application to Compressive Statistical Learning, Titouan Vayer and R\u00e9mi Gribonval.\n[2] On Memorization in Probabilistic Deep Generative Models, Gerrit J.J. van den Burg, Christopher K.I.

The MMD distance is a natural distance between distributions, using which one can solve generative modeling problems. So the latter computational problem is quite important for generative modeling based on kernels. It is shown that the MMD distance defined by the Riesz kernel has a very special structure, namely that the so-called sliced Riesz distance coincides with the MMD distance.\nThis allows one to estimate the gradient very precisely because one can take few 1-dimensional projections of empirical points and calculate an averaged sliced MMD. Based on that, authors design a generative modeling algorithm (described in the Appendix as Algorithm 3). Their algorithm performs well, taking into account Table 1, though which part of their algorithm is mainly responsible for such a promising outcome is a non-trivial issue."

We want to emphasize some advantages of our method which explain why it works that well.\n\n- The MMD and the energy distance (= MMD with Riesz kernel and $r=1$) have shown to be very effective two-sample tests to compare high-dimensional probability measures, see (Szekely, 2004). Therefore, minimizing these metrics via gradient flows is a natural approach. However, previous works on MMD flows (e.g. Arbel et al, 2019) were only applicable for small problems due to the quadratic computational cost in the number of samples. Only with our reduction of the computational cost it is possible to compute such MMD flows on datasets with 50000 images or more in a reasonable time.\n\n- Accurate gradient evaluations: We have proven convergence guarantees stating that the sliced MMD gradients converge to the original MMD gradients. \nMoreover, we do not require to solve an optimization problem within the steps which is necessary for other gradient flow methods which are often based on implicit schemes (like JKO).\n\n- The sequential learning approach is computationally efficient.\nThe whole generative model $\\Phi_L\\circ\\cdots\\circ\\Phi_1$ has a large number of parameters and is (as usual for generative models) a highly irregular mapping. However, during the training we only have to consider one of the networks $\\Phi_l$ at a time. This leads to a sequence of easier learnable problems instead of one hard one.\n\nWe added a paragraph \"Discussion\" in the conclusions section which summarizes these points.\n\nFor the architecture of the $\\Phi_l$ we used a standard UNet with the implementation of (Huang et al. 2021). Moreover, in our experiments changes in the architecture did not have a large effect on the results as long as it is expressive enough.\n\nReferences: \n\n(Szekely et al, 2004) Testing for equal distributions in high dimension\n\n(Arbel et al, 2019) Maximum Mean Discrepancy Gradient Flow\n\n(Huang et al, 2021) A variational perspective on diffusion-based generative models and score matching"

The author demonstrated their methods in section 5 with MNIST, FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets."

The methods is shown to work with simple data sets like MNIST and FashionMNIST, when they considered a much more complicated-structure data set like CIFAR10, then its FID is quite bad compared to NCSN and WGAN.  \n\nI do not find both theory and application part strong enough for publication."

                        "value": "Thank you very much for the review.\n\n- We extended our experimental part by the CelebA dataset which admits more structure than (Fashion)MNIST.\nHere, our method admits very good results. In particular, we outperform WGAN significantly (32.1 vs 41.3 in the FID).\nMoreover, on CIFAR10 our method is at least competitive with other gradient-flow-based methods though we agree that there is a gap between gradient-flow-based and score-based methods like NCSN (in our paper as well as in the literature). Compared with WGAN, we obtain with 54.8 vs 55.2 a similar (even slightly better) FID.\nNote that previous works on MMD flows (e.g. Arbel et al, 2019) were not able to scale to image generation because of the quadratic computational cost within the number of samples. As mentioned by reviewer HuoH our fast gradient computation \"opens up the possibility of employing MMD flows in generative modeling tasks that were previously considered impractical for these types of functions\".\n\n- Regarding the theoretical part, we would like to emphasize that our results provably lower the computational complexity of (gradient) evaluations of the MMD/energy distance. \nAll in all the proofs of our theorems are non-trivial and require a wide range of mathematical tools.\nThey are directly related to the applications part and result in a highly efficient algorithm for MMD (gradient) computations.\n\nWe hope that the reviewer will reconsider our paper with these explanations.\n\nReferences: \n\n(Arbel et al, 2019) Maximum Mean Discrepancy Gradient Flow"
