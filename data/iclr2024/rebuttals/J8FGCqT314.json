                    "value": "This study introduces a novel guidance strategy for enhancing the Decision Transformer (DT) by substituting the traditional return-to-go (RTG) value token with a specially learned subgoal, aimed at optimizing the underlying value function. This approach leverages a learned value function pretrained over an offline dataset. In this context, the process involves a search at each timestep to identify the future state within a given trajectory, one that returns the maximum discounted value. This particular state is then employed as a steering guidance (SG) or, effectively, a subgoal as a prompt at each timestep. Through this, the D2T2 method evolves to refine the DT's optimization process. Notably, D2T2 demonstrates substantial improvement over conventional value-based and behavior-cloning methods when evaluated on MuJoCo offline benchmarks."

The proposed methodology, detailed in Section 3.1, emerges as both a logical and auspicious solution to this complex issue. What sets this research apart is its pioneering approach of utilizing the entire subsequent state as a prompt for each individual state within the model. \n\n**Strength 2: Remarkable Empirical Performance**\n\nThe most striking strength of this paper, subject to further validation as outlined in the discussion of potential weaknesses, is the remarkable performance leap demonstrated over existing Transformer-based behavior cloning (BC) and value-based methods, as detailed in Table 3. The performance metrics of D2T2 are astounding; for instance, its achievement of approximately an 80 score on the halfcheetah-Medium-v2 benchmark is unprecedented, especially considering the highest score recorded in the dataset is around 45. Should these results be reliably replicated, they would signify a monumental advancement in the realm of offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL). This breakthrough has the potential to redefine the benchmarks for success in the field and opens up new avenues for research and application."

                "weaknesses": {
                    "value": "**Weakness 1: Lack of Clarity in Methodology Explanation**\n\nThe methodology, while innovative, suffers from a lack of clear exposition in its presentation, particularly in Section 3.1. The narrative structure and details within this section do not effectively convey the comprehensive process, resulting in certain ambiguities that could hinder readers' comprehension. A more organized and sequential presentation of the methodology would enhance understanding significantly. Ideally, the process should be delineated into four distinct stages:\n\n1. Pretraining the Value Function (V),\n2. Identifying and Labeling the Guided State (G_t) across all states,\n3. Training the Decision Transformer (DT) utilizing the labeled trajectories, and\n4. Developing the Steering Guidance (SG) predictor $g_{\\zeta}$, intended exclusively for the testing phase.\n\nThe current discourse in Section 3.1 disproportionately emphasizes steps 2 and 4, the step 3 is introduced in Section 3.2\nThe explanation of the value pretraining stage (step 1) is relegated to the latter part of Section 3.1 and lacks detailed insight into the pretraining mechanics. The term \"optimal value\" is used, leading to potential confusion over whether this refers to an \"in-sample\" optimal value [1] or something else (for example in the Medium dataset). A more explicit, step-by-step breakdown of the training phases, especially the pretraining of the value function, is necessary for readers to fully grasp the proposed method's mechanics and rationale. \n\n**Weakness 2: Challenges in Reproducibility**\n\nOne aspect that could enhance the credibility and impact of this work is improving its reproducibility. While the results presented, especially in the Medium and Med-Replay environments, are indeed impressive, the absence of a comprehensive process description somewhat hinders the independent replication of these findings.\n\nMy attempt to delve into the specifics, particularly regarding the pretraining of the value function\u2014presumably through Implicit Quantile Learning (IQL)\u2014for continuous state scenarios, led me to the source code provided by the authors. However, it appears the available code primarily pertains to tabular examples and does not extend to the MuJoCo tasks showcased in Table 3. This gap not only poses a challenge in understanding the specific methodologies applied but also in verifying the remarkable results indicated.\n\nThe findings in Table 3 are pivotal to the paper's contribution, and if they are as robust as presented, they deserve to be shared in a manner that the broader research community can thoroughly evaluate and build upon. To this end, I believe the inclusivity of the corresponding source code for the results in Table 3 is imperative. Providing this would significantly strengthen the paper's standing, and I am inclined to view this work more favorably should the authors facilitate a more transparent and accessible approach to reproducing these results.\n\n**Weakness 3: Inadequate Recognition of Previous Work**\n\nThis paper's novelty is evident in its application of guidance techniques to the Decision Transformer (DT); however, it misses adequately acknowledging similar foundational ideas in prior studies, for example [2]. There, the concept of directing offline policy via a learned value function\u2014central to this paper's hypothesis\u2014was also prominently featured.\n\nWhile the application to DT is innovative, the authors should explicitly recognize the contributions of earlier research to maintain scholarly thoroughness. A concise discussion highlighting how this study both aligns with and diverges would contextualize its unique contributions and strengthen the paper.\n\n[1] Fujimoto et al., Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods, ICML 2018.\n\n[2] Xu et al., A Policy-Guided Imitation Approach for Offline Reinforcement Learning, NeurIPS 2022"

                    "value": "Question 1) The manuscript frequently references the term \"optimal value.\" Could the authors clarify whether this refers specifically to the \"in-sample optimal value,\" denoting the value function learned from the batch (e.g., from Medium data)? The current terminology might lead readers to misunderstand it as the value function associated with the optimal policy, which may not be the intention. Precision in this definition could help avoid potential confusion.\n\nQuestion 2) Considering the significant impact of the results related to the MuJoCo tasks, do the authors intend to release the code to reproduce these results? Providing this code would be instrumental for the community, allowing for independent verification and potentially furthering the study's contributions."

                    "value": "1. The rationale behind the proposed method appears flawed. On page 3, the author states, \"the success of DT relies on the successful estimation of \\(R_t^*\\)\" and posits that the generation of the optimal action hinges on this estimation. However, doesn't the generation of actions depend on both \\(R_t\\) and \\(S_t\\)? If I recall correctly, the original DT paper suggests that actions are derived from the input token \\(S_t\\), reinforcing my conviction that the claim is incomplete.\n\n2. The evaluation results seem inadequate. A more comprehensive assessment would involve examining the generated \\(\\hat{G}\\) in a few toy examples and analyzing its influence on action generation in comparison to the default return-to-go \\(R_t\\).\n\n3. The paper requires significant improvements in writing clarity and completeness. Essential background information is omitted; for instance, the paper fails to provide context on steering guidance signals, a crucial concept in the proposed method.\n\nPlease also consult the question section for additional concerns."

                "questions": {
                    "value": "1. **Proof of Theorem 1**: The author posits that the optimal policy is solely dependent on the input return-to-go \\(R_t\\). However, it stands to reason that if the input state \\(s_t\\) varies, the optimal action should adjust in response.\n\n2. **Figure 1 (1)**: Shouldn't the output of the Transformer-based BC be \\(\\hat{G}\\) rather than \\(G\\)?\n\n3. **Proposed Step I**: The introduction of Step I appears to add computational complexity to DT. Specifically, the \\(O(N!)\\) time complexity arising from the calculation of \\(G(t)\\) is a concern. It would be useful to juxtapose the wall time training efficiencies of D2T2 and DT.\n\n4. **Related to Point 3**: Another concern arises from the potential incompleteness of the dataset. One of the advantages of offline RL, especially DT, is that post-training, the policy can concatenate actions from disparate trajectories, leading to \"sub-optimal\" policies. However, the proposed method seems to regard \\(G_t\\) as an optimal value guiding subsequent training. I'm curious about how this approach guarantees the discovery of an optimal policy when the dataset might be inadequate.\n\n5. The author briefly touches upon the statement, \"we leverage variational inference (Kingma & Welling, 2013) to concentrate the learned knowledge into a compact and expressive latent space via a variational auto-encoder (VAE),\" This assertion is somewhat ambiguous. Could you clarify the terms \"concise\" and \"expressive\"? Additionally, how does one quantify these characteristics?"

With the finding that DTs almost surely outputs the optimal trajectory in deterministic environments but suffers performance degradation in stochastic environments due to growing variance of RTGs, authors propose D2T2 to improve DTs performance in stochastic environment. This is done by replacing R (Returns-to-go) in DT with a new steering vector G (SG- Steering Guidance, learned by a separate causal transformer; sometimes couples with VAE) that provides guidance to DT to achieve the desired next state. The SG utilize TD learning to address the growing variance problem of RTG. Experiments are presented to display the effectiveness of the D2T2 method."

A lot of back and forth has to be done to properly understand the work.

It is briefly mentioned in section1, 2.3 and explained in Tailgate driving part of experiments. I think it should be separately emphasized somewhere in the beginning.\n2. Coming to point 1, the claim needs to be substantiated by experiments on more tasks. Only Tailgate diving task is used to validate this claim.\n3. The proof presented for Proposition 1 primarily re-iterates that the DT in question is well trained and will output the optimal action.
