                    "value": "LoRA, a widely used technique for fine-tuning a small number of parameters in foundation models, exhibits a weakness in batched inference settings where each request in the batch requires a unique adapter.\nIn such a scenario, batched inference using LoRA becomes sequential and inefficient. This paper proposes a variant of LoRA, called fast LoRA (FLoRA), which utilizes a parameterization that enables minibatch computations to be performed using matrix multiplications. This makes it efficient to perform batched inferences with distinct adapters per request. \nThe paper presents a computational analysis demonstrating that FLoRA can achieve improvements in both throughput and latency compared to LoRA for scenarios involving low-rank and small model dimensions. \nThe paper presents empirical results demonstrating the advantages of FLoRA over LoRA when using StarCoder (Li et al., 2023) as the foundation model. On multilingual code generation and speech recognition tasks, FLoRA achieves similar performance to LoRA and outperforms IA3."

For example, as shown in Fig. 2b, waiting 2.2 sec per output token is impractical in real-world applications. fLoRA provided an alternative solution in such scenarios, improving throughput and reducing latency without compromising accuracy. We will clarify this in our revised manuscript to emphasize that the bottleneck addressed is in computational performance.\n\n> The whole mechanism and the algorithm isn't mentioned clearly. e.g., how to choose the batch size for real situations, how to make each example corresponding to its appropriate adapters during inference. \n\nThank you for pointing this out. We will make sure to include more algorithmic details in the revision. For the experiment in Sec 4.1, the vLLM framework does not use batch size. Instead, it uses max number batched tokens to control how many tokens can be batched in one forward pass. For the throughput experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 8192, following the convention of using higher batch size for throughput benchmarking. Assuming the average input length of the testing dataset (the chat dataset to fine-tune the Vicuna model) is 512 then the batch size would be 16. For the latency experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 2560 which is the default setting of the vLLM framework for online serving.  \n\nWe assume the simplest case in the serving experiment where all possible adapters have been loaded in the memory. We also assume that each example (each request) in the batch is associated with an adapter id, then the adapter can be chosen by calling torch indexing.\n\n> Memory consumption.\n\nIn the serving scenario, we did not observe any memory difference between fLoRA and LoRA. The vLLM framework will fit as many tokens as possible (but less than max_num_batched_tokens), utilizing all GPU memory. In the fine-tuning stage, when the rank is small, the memory consumption of fLoRA is roughly the same as LoRA. However, when the rank gets bigger (say rank > 7), the memory consumption of fLoRA is larger than LoRA. Notice that the self-attention layer accounts for the major memory consumption which fLoRA and LoRA don't touch. We will clarify this in the revision.\n\n\n> What is \u201csame expressive power\u201d\n\nWe use \"expressive power\" to denote the rank of the modulation matrix. Both fLoRA and LoRA have the capability to modulate the weight matrix up to any desired rank. In this perspective, they have the same expressive power. We will make this clearer in the revision.\n\n> Rationale for Multiplication in fLoRA\n\nThe transition from addition to multiplication is primarily driven by computational efficiency. The multiplication operator enables the batching mechanism."

Both fLoRA and LoRA have the capability to modulate the weight matrix up to any desired rank. In this perspective, they have the same expressive power. We will make this clearer in the revision.\n\n> Expect a higher, rather than simply equivalent, accuracy compared to LoRA?\n\nIn our experiments (Sec. 4.2 and Sec. 4.3), we also trained task specific LoRA heads for each language in order for a fair comparison. Hence, one wouldn\u2019t expect fLoRA outperform LoRA in terms of accuracy on the tasks we considered. In practice, the **average task accuracy** of fLoRA might be higher LoRA assuming LoRA has to use the same adapter in a majority of samples. However, our experiments did not account for this scenario so we did not claim a higher accuracy from fLoRA.\n\n> In fLoRA the weight matrix specific for each example is the element-wise MULTIPLICATION of W0 and DeltaWi?\n\nThis is correct.\n\n> Scenarios when Eq 7 is less than 1.\n\nEquation 7 will not hold true when the rank (r) is large. This is supported by the data shown in Figure 2, where LoRA's performance begins to exceed that of fLoRA as the rank increases beyond a certain threshold. We will elaborate on this in the revised version.\n\nWe also appreciate the feedback on how to improve the paper\u2019s readability such as removing references from the abstract and better framing in Fig 1. We will make these adjustments in the revision."

Intuitively, there is at least 4 factors for this: the model, the gpu architecture, the rank of the adaptation and the batch size . The rank is taken into account but it is not very clear how the other elements will come into play in practice. Eq 7 claims only important factors are the dimension of the multiplication the constants for MM and BMM and the rank. However, it is difficult to understand why this should be the case for batch size 1 in contrast to a larger batch size.\nComputing some plots in this area would have been very helpful to grasp how the theoretical analysis transfer to the practical scenarios..\nAnother example of this would be computing per token and example adapters , which is the extreme case. It would have been interesting for latency and throughput curves to see such an extreme case, even though there is no such a real task. \nThe section 3.1 is confusing in its current form and a rewrite paying attention to the Matrix and elementwise operations would improve readability. \nGiven the constrains of the approach regarding the low-rank dimension, the applicability of the approach is limited to some specific scenarios which could have already been taken care on the base LLM pretraining. For instance, for the multilingual case the models could have already specific sparsely activated components given the language category or the programing language from the beginning."

                        "value": "Thank you for your thorough review and constructive feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns.\n\n> Why is the batch size not appearing in Eq 7?\n\nThis is because for presentation purposes we assume c1 and c2 are constants and c1 >> c2. But in the actual PyTorch implementation, c1/c2 is a function of batch size (c1 = c2 when batch size is 1 and c1>>c2 when batch size is large). Notice that in the linear layer during LLM serving, the effective batch size is # sequences * max_sequence_length so it is safe to assume c1 >> c2. We will clarify this aspect in the revision.\n\n> Throughput and latency under per token case.\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion that analyzing the throughput and latency under such an extreme case will offer more insights. We agree that this analysis will provide a more comprehensive study of fLoRA's serving capabilities. This scenario is expected to demonstrate even more advantages for fLoRA over BMM LoRA. This requires a new implementation under our current modification over the vLLM framework. We will include this study in the revision. We will also consider the per batch adapter case as mentioned in your questions.\n\n> Limited applicability \n\nThank you for pointing out the limited applicability due to the low-rank setup. We agree that some applicable scenarios can be taken care of by the base LLM pretraining. While it's true that certain scenarios could be addressed during base LLM pretraining, we want to point out that our approach is particularly beneficial for tailoring responses to specific user requests that may involve tail knowledge such as a personal codebase or personal browning history, which is usually not covered in pre-training. \n\n> Batch size\n\nThank you for pointing out the impact of batch size. In the vLLM framework, it uses max number batched tokens to control how many tokens can be batched in one forward pass. For the throughput experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 8192, following the convention of using the model context size (Starcoder). Assuming the average input length of the testing dataset (the chat dataset to fine-tune the Vicuna model) is 512 then the batch size would be 16. For the latency experiment, we set max_num_batched_tokens to be 2560 which is the default setting of the vLLM framework for online serving.  \n\nFurthermore, according to https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/blob/master/blogs/deepspeed-fastgen/README.md, section 3, the number of batched tokens is a better signal than batch size when measuring the performance in the serving scenario. The convention to measure throughput is to increase the number of batched tokens to reach the throughput-saturating regime. \n\nWe ran additional experiments with max_num_batched_tokens=4096 and max_num_batched_tokens=2048. The throughput of both fLoRA and LoRA reduced roughly 10% and 20% compared to max_num_batched_tokens=8192. This is because it is not in the throughput-saturating regime of the H100 GPU. The critical rank remains the same. \n\nWe will include this study in the revision.\n\n> Confusing section 3.1\n\nWe appreciate your feedback on the clarity of Section 3.1. We will revise this section to improve its readability."
