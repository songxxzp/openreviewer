                    "value": "1. Oracle assumed is too strong and impractical. The oracle solves a very hard computational problem even in the classical setting, especially in the low temperature regime. The setting in this work is the quantum analogue of learning classical graphical models given an oracle that can always return the sufficient statistics given the energy function of a model. \n\nThe main technical challenge that needs to be addressed in this field is the fact that there are no quantum versions of the pseudo-likelihood type methods that are used to learn classical Gibbs states. The existence of these methods in the quantum regime would bypass the need for these types of oracles. A very recent work (https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02243) has shown that the computational complexity of solving this problem is polynomial in the size of the system, without assuming any strong oracles. This new method has much worse sample complexity, so a practical algorithm is still out of reach.\n\nIn general oracles are useful to establish relative complexity of two tasks, inference and learning in this case. But for learning Gibbs states, from classical results, we already know that inference is much harder than learning. So the bounds established in this work are only marginally interesting.\n\n2. It is mostly using established techniques in optimization to solve a standard problem of matching sufficient statistics (essentially Maximum Likelihood).  Novelty of this work mainly comes from the techniques used to establish the bounds on Hessian.  The methods used to solve the problem it self are not new.\n\n3. Overall the method is not very efficient. Theory gives an exponential worst case run-time (which is absorbed into the oracle) and the field of quantum computing is too nascent to provide any high quality data  to establish any practical claims regarding the algorithm. \n\nOverall I don't think this work has made any good breakthroughs in solving this problem and is not a good fit for ICLR. The new  Quantum BP method is interesting and might be a good research direction."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for a very informative report.\n\nThe reviewer's primary concern is the use of the adaptive oracle access model. Especially, the reviewer thought that the oracles assumed in this paper (referred to as adaptive oracles in the reply) were stronger than those in the Hamiltonian learning from Gibbs states (referred to as Gibbs oracles).\nWhile adding adaptivity to the oracle does strengthen the requirements, we do not believe that the adaptive oracle is significantly different from the Gibbs oracle for the following reason. Both setups necessitate access to copies of Gibbs states or their local density matrices associated with a specific Hamiltonian. In the Hamiltonian learning from Gibbs states problem, the oracle is implicit in the problem, assuming that nature or a specific algorithm can prepare and provide such states for the true Hamiltonian. In the adaptive oracle setup, the Hamiltonian is adaptively chosen, but it shares the same locality as the true Hamiltonian. Thus, assuming a natural process or algorithm exists for preparing the true Hamiltonian, the same process could be employed for the adaptively chosen Hamiltonian. In this sense, it would be inaccurate to claim that Hamiltonian learning algorithms do not require strong oracles and that the adaptive oracle is significantly stronger than Gibbs oracles. We do agree with the reviewer that it is an important issue that needs to be addressed, and exploring under what conditions we can approximate the local density matrices of the Gibbs state is a fascinating question. This may, indeed, limit the algorithm to certain special cases where such an approximation is feasible.\n\nThe reviewer also said, \"... from classical results, we know that inference is much harder than learning\". This probably refers to the result of Montanari 2015. The claim is correct for \"inference from sufficient statistics\" and may not apply to the more general setting. The all-temperature learning algorithm (arXiv:2310.02243) the reviewer mentioned can be considered an *inference* algorithm where the data used is 2^\\beta-local density matrices of the Gibbs state. In other words, it is possible to consider an inference algorithm where the local regions are larger than the locality of the Hamiltonian.\n\nThe reviewer asks for a comparison of the complexity of our algorithms with high-temperature learning results of arXiv:2108.04842. We will add a comparison in future revisions. However, we would like to emphasize that the focus of the paper is not to improve theoretical lower bounds at the expense of algorithm simplicity. Our paper aims to consider simpler algorithms grounded in classical theory and demonstrate how optimization heuristics can further enhance their practicality."

For instance, consider a classical version of this problem. Having a system that can prepare the high temperature  state of an Ising type model with frustration is much simpler that constructing an oracle that can return expectation values from the same model at a lower temperature (for instance in a spin glass phase). Even natural processes can get stuck in metastable states at lower temperatures in such models. So it cannot be assumed that natural process that prepares a high-temperature state can be used to generate states of the same Hamiltonian at a lower temperature. The main weakness I see in the paper is that it is solving a strictly easier problem than Anshu et. al (2021) and I do not see any good reason to consider the weaker version of the problem."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's comments. While it is true that the algorithms we studied were proposed in recent works, the main contributions of our paper lie in (1) the analysis of the convergence rate of these algorithms in the quantum setting and (2) the exploration of quasi-Newton accelerations, specifically for the quantum case. Our motivation is to understand the quantum analogs of state-of-the-art classical algorithms and demonstrate their efficacy with provable convergence rates in the quantum domain. Additionally, we investigate the suitability of quasi-Newton accelerations for quantum scenarios.\n\nWe acknowledge the reviewer's observation that our modified quantum belief propagation simply involves changing \"tanh\" to \"sinh.\" However, the significance lies not in using a new function per se but rather in the fact that only the \"sinh\" version enables us to establish the desired upper bound for the Hessian of the log-partition function. It is natural to attempt to use the standard quantum belief propagation with \"tanh\" to prove this bound, but one would encounter difficulties establishing the derivative's positivity. While we did not attempt to establish a lower bound, we conjecture that similar bounds as in the Hamiltonian learning case would follow.\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback, and we will ensure that these points are further clarified in the paper."

                        "value": "We appreciate the reviewer's thorough feedback. Here are our responses to the questions and weaknesses mentioned in the report.\n\nIn terms of motivation, our goal is to explore the applicability of state-of-the-art classical algorithms to analogous problems in the quantum domain. We believe these classically inspired algorithms may offer practical advantages over existing quantum algorithms.\n\nWe acknowledge the concern raised by the reviewer regarding the use of adaptive oracles, which was also questioned by another reviewer. While we agree that this is an area for improvement, we believe that the adaptive oracle assumption is only a slight strengthening of assuming the availability of Gibbs states for the true Hamiltonian. We argue that if there exists a natural process or algorithm capable of providing the Gibbs state for the true Hamiltonian (as required by the Hamiltonian learning problems), the same process should work for the adaptively chosen Hamiltonians in our algorithm, as these chosen Hamiltonians share the same locality as the true Hamiltonian.\n\nWe are unsure what it refers to in your question about \"systems studied\" in the experiments. If the question pertains to the Hamiltonian systems considered in our numerical simulations, they are random 2-local Hamiltonians. If the reviewer was inquiring about the computing systems used for the experiments, we used a workstation with 32 CPUs (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8369HB CPU @ 3.30GHz) and 64GB of memory.\n\nRegarding the novelty of our work, we indeed employ the work of Anshu et al. for the lower bound, while the upper bound of the spectrum serves as the main technical contribution of our paper.\n\nRegarding the minor comments:\n\n1. We will clarify on page 1 that H_j refers to a local matrix. In local Hamiltonian literature, omitting the tensor I part for each H_j is customary when writing H = \\sum_j H_j. We will ensure proper clarification in the next update.\n\n2. Regarding the issue with Algorithm 1, we believe that using k is correct, as it represents the number of F_j operators."

                        "value": "We would like to express our gratitude to the reviewer for their comments and questions. The generalization of classical results to the quantum case encounters a significant challenge due to the non-commutativity of matrices within the matrix exponentials present in the log-partition function. This non-commutativity prevents the derivative of the matrix exponential function from having a simple closed-form formula. The technical innovation of our paper lies in the application of a newly proposed quantum belief propagation method (Lemma C.3) to provide bounds on the eigenvalues of the Hessian of the log-partition function, even in cases where we do not possess a formula for the Hessian. In classical scenarios, the corresponding part of the proof would be relatively straightforward."
