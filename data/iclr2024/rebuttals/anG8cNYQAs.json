The tracks have been identified after a significant amount of preprocessing, including temporal interpolation of the satellite image sequences. Based on this dataset, the authors have posed two problems: localization of the cyclone's position, and estimation of its intensity. Based on intensity, each even has been categorized as deep depression, sever cyclonic storm etc. They can be solved using Deep Learning models, similar to the object detection techniques like YOLO, RCNN etc which the authors have tested as benchmarks on this dataset."

MGTCF: Multi-Generator Tropical Cyclone Forecasting with Heterogeneous Meteorological Data by Huang et al, AAAI 2023\u2019\n\nThank you for your thoughtful comments. While we acknowledge the importance of cyclone tracking, our paper focuses on cyclone intensity estimation and provides an additional dataset for cyclone detection to facilitate the development of end-to-end models. We have included temporal information in the dataset in the form of filenames, allowing researchers to construct their tracking datasets if they choose to do so. As you rightly mentioned, track prediction can be conducted independently of satellite images, thus we have developed a dataset primarily focusing on cyclone detection and intensity estimation and not on cyclone track prediction. Regarding the suggestion to use object tracking in videos as benchmarking for our dataset, we believe the two tasks are considerably different. Significant research has taken place in improving the inference time of object tracking algorithms in videos, but the dataset and satellite imagery we utilize have a frequency of 15 minutes per image. Additionally, research in object tracking in videos involves accurately tracking multiple objects through occlusion at once, but the object in our work (cyclone) occurrences are infrequent, with at most two cyclones in an image. Thus, the challenges addressed in general object-tracking research, such as tracking multiple objects, fast inference, occlusion, etc. in an image, are not prevalent in our domain. However, we encourage researchers interested in cyclone tracking to create their datasets tailored to their specific needs and we have now mentioned this in the conclusion and future directions section (section 6) as well. Also, thanks for bringing the valuable references to our attention. Regarding the references that you have provided, we have already cited the first paper in your list in our paper. While the second paper is relevant, the authors have not provided a publicly accessible link to their dataset. The third paper, although very recent, does not pertain to cyclone intensity estimation or cyclone detection. We appreciate your feedback and remain open to further discussions or suggestions."

                        "value": "> \u2018The paper proposes a dataset for cyclone detection and evaluates several standard object detection and regression methods for this task. It establishes that the Dvorak technique is usually used in the field. However, it is not compared to the experiments. Hence, it is not clear if any of the tested models is applicable or an improvement in this field. I believe this would be a good/reasonable paper for a remote sensing or application-specific conference or journal\u2019\n\nThank you for your feedback on our paper. In our work, the labels for the dataset were originally generated using the Dvorak technique by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), more details can be found here https://rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/report.php?internal_menu=MzM= and https://mausam.imd.gov.in/imd_latest/contents/pdf/cyclone_sop.pdf. The manual nature of the Dvorak technique introduces subjectivity and limitations, prompting the adoption of AI methods to automate and provide more objective insights into cyclone detection and intensity estimation. We agree that a remote sensing or application-specific venue would also be appropriate for this paper but through this work, we aim to bring a remote sensing problem to the computer vision/ML research community and we have also mentioned this in our paper in the section 1 introduction. We have curated a dataset for cyclone detection and cyclone intensity estimation and we believe that the ML research community has a lot to offer if they are provided with a comprehensive dataset for cyclone detection and intensity estimation.\n\n>\u2018The introduction makes several high-level statements without citations. E.g., \"In literature, there have been some well-documented datasets for cyclone intensity estimation\". However, none are cited.\u2019\n\nThank you for your feedback on our paper. We want to clarify that we have indeed cited publicly accessible datasets in our paper, including TCIR and Maskey et al., we have even compared our dataset with other publicly accessible datasets to provide an objective comparison between these datasets as shown in table 1 on page 7.\n\n>\u2018citations are stated twice, such as \"Maskey et al. Maskey et al. (2023)\" throughout the entire paper.'\n\n>'the paper is a half-page over length.'\n\nThank you for bringing the issue of improper citations to our attention. We sincerely apologize for the oversight. The repetition of citations was inadvertently introduced due to the specific citation format required by ICLR which was considerably different than the previous conference. We have now rectified this issue, ensuring that citations appear correctly throughout the entire paper. We have also taken the necessary steps to trim down the content, and the revised version now adheres to the specified 9-page limit.\n\n>\u2018Several high-profile domain/application journals exist where the challenges of cyclone detection can discussed with reviewers that have domain expertise in exactly this problem field. For instance, the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, where Manil Maskey (cited extensively in this work) submitted their paper. What makes ICLR the suitable venue for this application/problem? Additionally, not a single paper cited in this work was published at ICLR.\u2019\n\nWe appreciate your suggestion and acknowledge that there are domain-specific journals for discussing challenges in cyclone detection, such as the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing. However, our choice of ICLR stems from our objective of bridging the gap between remote sensing and the computer vision/ML community, we have also mentioned the purpose of this paper being bridging the gap between remote sensing and AI research in our paper in section 1 introduction. By presenting our work at a machine learning conference, we aim to engage the computer vision research community in addressing the unique challenges of cyclone detection and intensity estimation."

I apologize that I may have been too conclusive in parts in my first review in this regard. Still, the text-wise presentation made me think the text had been copied between submission templates. Concretely, these were word-by-word identical abstracts, and errors in the citation style and the over-length submission in this submission that hinted towards a mere copying of the text between the submission templates.\nGiven the many constructive comments and suggestions in the previous version (similar to the comments by other reviewers in this submission), would have required a more thorough rewriting of the entire paper including the abstract.\n\nAlso here, some of the listed changes, such as the explanation of the context of the Dvorak technique, do not seem to be addressed sufficiently, as this question was raised again in this submission.\nHere, the response to my raised question with external links and a rather motivational description like \"It introduces subjectivity and limitations\" seems not satisfactory in this regard. From this response, it seems that the Dvorak technique is rather a manual labeling tool than a detection approach (\"manual nature\", \"introduces subjectivity\", \"labels generated through the Dvorak technique\")? The paper abstract suggests that it is rather a [automated] detection method.\nThis should become clear from the description within the abstract and paper without referencing external sources."

It includes raw (21K) and augmented (up to 68K) infrared satellite imagery data and annotations for 2013 - 2021 years. The authors include the features, required for object identification and intensity estimation and cyclone track data.\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the dataset itself over the new geographical region; the dataset creation pipeline and a comparison of state-of-the-art models, presented in this dataset. The dataset creation pipeline is well presented, and the paper is generally well written. The methods, presented in the paper, cover three popular deep learning models for object detection (Yolo5, EfficientNet and Faster RCNN) and five popular deep learning methods for intensity estimation. \n\nThe overall paper presentation and problem description, as well as the dataset itself, meet the minimum criteria for the novel contribution in the field of ML for environmental tasks."

For instance, the authors of the paper https://ijrpr.com/uploads/V4ISSUE4/IJRPR11379.pdf have not provided any publicly accessible link to the dataset nor have they provided any details about how the dataset was curated. The exact details of implementing their work are missing. The authors of the paper at https://ijrpr.com/uploads/V4ISSUE4/IJRPR12056.pdf claim they have used the TCIR dataset (which we have also cited in our work), but they also claim that their dataset is derived from INSAT 3D satellite, but the TCIR dataset has cited GridSat as their source which in turn uses the GOES satellite images thus contradicting their claims. Moreover, the lack of DOI for these papers also makes it impossible to cite them in our work. Apart from the two papers, we have found another paper indulging in comparable deficiencies in research integrity. For example, the authors of paper 10.1109/ICIDCA56705.2023.10099964  claim they have used cyclone images from INSAT 3D satellite from 2012-2021, but the INSAT-3D satellite was launched on 25 July 2013 thus suggesting false claims in their work. These deficiencies make these works unsuitable to be cited in our work. We assure you that our research is an independent and original contribution. We have meticulously developed a comprehensive dataset for cyclone detection and intensity estimation in popular formats used by the computer vision research community, our dataset is available on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8015544"
