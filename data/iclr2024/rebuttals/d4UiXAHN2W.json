                    "value": "This paper introduces the LLaMA-Adapter, a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models. The authors pre-append word tokens with a few learnable adaption prompts and employ a zero-initialized attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these new instructional cues, while retaining its pre-trained knowledge. LLaMA-Adapter delivers performance on par with fully-finetuned or LoRA-finetuned Alpaca and generalizes well in multi-modal scenarios."

The concept of zero-initialized attention closely mirrors the zero-initialized convolution in ControlNet [Zhang et al., ICCV 2023]. This seems more like an engineering design rather than a groundbreaking technical contribution. Of the four main characteristics highlighted by the authors in the introduction, both (1) parameter efficiency and (3) plugin with expertise are attributes already provided by LoRA. Regarding (2) training efficiency, the improvement over LoRA is incremental: a reduction from 1.5 hours to 1 hour (in Table 1), while achieving comparable accuracy (in Figure 5). Also, reducing the rank of LoRA can further reduce the number of trainable parameters and potentially speed up the training. I suggest the authors include an additional ablation study on this. Based on these, I am not confident whether the technical contributions and empirical performance of this paper meet the publication standards of ICLR."

While LLaMA-Adapter may reduce memory usage, it doesn't necessarily reduce computation, a potential constraint on mobile devices.\n* The learnable adaptation tokens have been prefixed to the last 30 of 32 layers.

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate your careful and constructive reviews. We hope our response can address your concerns.\n\n---\n> **Q1: The concept of zero-initialized attention closely mirrors the zero-initialized convolution in ControlNet**\n\n>\nSorry for the confusion caused. Our zero-initialized attention shares similar high-level motivations with ControlNet, i.e., progressively injecting new knowledge into the pre-trained model. However, our method is very different in four aspects.\n\n1. **Target Task.**  ControlNet aims to inject visual conditions into pre-trained diffusion models, which conducts text-to-image generation. Our target is to incorporate pre-trained LLMs with new instruction signals (language or multi-modality), tuning an LLM into an instruction-following model.\n2. **Methodology.** On top of the CNN-based U-Net, ControlNet zero-initializes ***traditional convolutional layers***, and ***directly adds*** new conditions with the pre-trained features by residual connections. In contrast, considering the transformer architecture of LLMs, we propose to achieve zero-initialization within the self-attention layer by ***a learnable gating factor***. Then, we inject the new instruction cues into LLMs ***naturally through the attention process***, which adaptively controls the interaction between prompts and word tokens.\n3. **Parameter Efficiency.** ControlNet creates an entire copy of U-Net's encoder for training, which contains over 300M learnable parameters. However, our method only contains 1.2M parameters for adaption prompts and zero-initialized gating factors (1.8M for the multi-modal variant),  indicating superior parameter efficiency.\n\nTherefore, the zero-initialized attention of LLaMA-Adapter is distinct from ControlNet in both ideas and technical details.\n\n---\n> **Q2: The method seems more like an engineering design rather than a groundbreaking technical contribution**\n\n>\nOur LLaMA-Adapter is not just an engineering design, but brings new insight to the field of LLM-based instruction tuning. We summarize our academic contributions as follows.\n\n1. **Progressively injecting instruction cues.** Existing methods do not involve explicit designs to control how much instruction knowledge is injected into LLMs. This might disturb the pre-trained weights of LLMs, especially at the early training stage. To this end, we propose to utilize a learnable gating factor within LLM's self-attention layers, which is initialized as zeros to progressively incorporate new instruction cues into LLMs. Such a parameter-efficient design contributes to a more stable training process (***Figure 7 of the paper***), and can be utilized for future instruction-tuning methods.\n\n2. **Generalizability for multi-modal reasoning.** In addition to language instructions, by simply adding multi-scale image features, our LLaMA-Adapter can be extended to a visual instruction model and conduct multi-modal reasoning. In contrast, the previous Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRA only support language instruction-following. Also, we report our downstream performance to fine-tune conventional vision and language models (ViT, RoBERTa, CLIP), demonstrating superior generalization capacity.\n\nTherefore, our LLaMA-Adapter not only verifies the importance of zero-initially injecting instruction cues, but also exhibits good generalizability over a wide range of application scenarios.\n\n---\n> **Q3: The main difference comparing to Alpaca-LoRA**\n\n>\nIt is true that Alpaca-LoRA can also achieve parameter- and time-efficiency (4.2M, 1.5h), even though our LLaMA-Adapter is more efficient (1.2M, 1h). More importantly, the main difference of our approach is ***the generalization capacity for multi-modal input***. LoRA appends trainable rank decomposition matrices into each transformer layer, which entirely inherits the original structures of LLMs. Therefore, LoRA cannot be extended to process new input features. In contrast, our LLaMA-Adapter with adaption prompts and zero-initialized attention is generalizable to accept new input conditions for instruction following, e.g., the plugin with visual reasoning expertise. With our approach, LLaMA can be fine-tuned into a multi-modal LLM with competitive visual understanding capability to existing multi-modal LLMs (shown in ***Table 3 of the paper***), which indicates our promising generalizability for wider application scenarios."

                        "value": "> **Q4: I suggest including the additional ablation study on reducing the rank of LoRA**\n\n>\nThanks for your advice! It is very necessary to evaluate the performance of Alpaca-LoRA with fewer parameters comparable to LLaMA-Adapter. The default rank of Alpaca-LoRA is 8, and we respectively show the results with the ranks of 2, 4, and 16 in the table below. For a more comprehensive assessment, we evaluate their language processing capabilities on **Open LLM benchmark** [1]. It evaluates LLMs' generative abilities in four different tasks: AI2 Reasoning Challenge [2], HellaSwag [3], MMLU [4], and TruthfulQA [5]. Each task contains challenging data samples over a wide range of knowledge domains. \n| Model | Rank | Param | Time | Avg | ARC | HellaSwag | MMLU | TruthfulQA |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Alpaca-LoRA | 2 | 1.0 | 1.48 | 50.9 | 53.6 | 77.9 | 37.9 | 34.0 |\n| Alpaca-LoRA | 4 | 2.1 | 1.49 | 50.8 | 53.5 | 77.8 | 37.5 | 34.4 |\n| Alpaca-LoRA | 8 | 4.2 | 1.49 | 50.7 | 53.2 | 78.1 | 37.1 | 34.5 |\n| Alpaca-LoRA | 16 | 8.4 | 1.5 | 50.8 | 53.0 | 78.0 | 37.1 | 34.9 |\n| LLaMA-Adapter | - | 1.2 | 1 | 52.2 | 54.7 | 78.8 | 34.9 | 40.4 |\n\nAs shown above, lower ranks of LoRA can effectively reduce the learnable parameters from 8.4M to 1.0M, and slightly lower the training time from 1.5h to 1.48h. However, our LLaMA-Adapter with 1.2M parameters and 1h still attains the best average result, demonstrating a good trade-off between performance and training efficiency.\n\n---\n> **Q5: The rescaled attention scores in Eq. 7 no longer represent a probability distribution. Why not [softmax($S_a)\\cdot g;$ softmax($S_b)\\cdot (1-g)$]?**\n\n>\nSorry for the confusion caused. Here, we denote the attention scores of the newly added prompts as $S_a$, the existing word tokens as $S_b$, and the learnable gating factor as $g$.\n During training, we aim to preserve the pre-trained knowledge of the LLM, i.e., softmax$(S_b)$, and adaptively incorporate the new instruction cues, i.e., softmax$(S_a)$. Thus, we do not multiply any coefficient to softmax$(S_b)$ to prevent the pre-trained knowledge from being disturbed, i.e., preserving its originally pre-trained probability distribution. The zero-initialized $g$ is only multiplied to $S_a$ to adaptively determine how much new information is injected into LLMs.\n\n---\n> **Q6: While LLaMA-Adapter may reduce memory usage, it doesn't necessarily reduce computation, a potential constraint on mobile devices**\n\n>\nThanks for pointing out! Our claim concerning mobile devices is not rigorously precise. We have rectified it in the revised paper as \"LLaMA-Adapter enables more efficient storage of large-scale language models on mobile devices\".\n\n---\n> **Q7: How about inserting adaption prompts across all transformer layers?**\n\n>\nAs you suggested, we conduct an ablation study on the insertion layer numbers on ScienceQA in the table below. As shown, inserting at the ***last 30 layers*** is better than the ***early 30 layers*** or ***all layers***. \nThis indicates that it's more effective to inject the instructional cues into layers capturing higher-level semantics for lanuguage generation. There also exists an optimal insertion number from the higher layers, since too few layers might underfit the training data, while too many layers would adversely disturb the early encoding of input words. If one has limited resources to identify the best insertion layer number, simply inserting our modules into all transformer layers is generally a good solution.\n| Layers| Params|Val Acc.\n|:---|:---:|:---\n|Last 30|1.79|83.85\n|Early 30|1.79|79.69\n|All 32|1.83|81.03\n\n\n---\n> **Q8: The output program in Fig. 4 seems to produce repetitive numbers**\n\n>\nThanks for pointing out! Our generated program showcases correct logic, but places the \u201cprint()\u201d function in the wrong place, which outputs repetitive numbers. As the output of LLMs exhibits some randomness, we can obtain the correct program by another running, as shown in ***Figure 4 of the revised paper***.\n\n#### Reference:\n#### [1] https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard/.\n#### [2] Think you have Solved Question Answering?

Compared to the closest baseline, the Alpaca, the proposed method is more effective yet efficient on the same training data and the same LLM (LLaMA 7B).\n- The proposed method has the potential to be used in various domains, including vision and vision language. For example, the zero-initialized attention mechanism can be incorporated with transformer-based vision models like ViT or CLIP, instead of full finetunuing. \n- The manuscripts contain extensive qualitative examples compared to various language and multi-modal models."

                    "value": "- I think a number of baselines and performance of the proposed method on multi-modal evaluation are weak to convince the proposed method is more effective than full finetuning LLMs or other efficient methods. I understand there are a lot of recent multi-modal models but many of them are concurrent works. However, I think BLIP2 [1] can be treated as a baseline, which is also a prior work of reported baseline, mini-GPT4. Based on this, I think the reported performances in Table 3 are weak compared to others. For example, the proposed method achieved a 973 score on the MME benchmark, while BLIP2 did 1293. Furthermore, a recent multi-modal model LLaVA-1.5 [2], which fully fine-tunes LLMs, achieved the 1510 score using the Vicuna 7B model. Therefore, I think this manuscript should include empirical backups to show the proposed method is still effective and efficient in the multi-modal domain. \n- I think the most important baselines on instruction following evaluation are Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRa. However, the manuscript only provides qualitative comparisons and brief comparisons in Figure 2. I think it would be great if more quantitative comparisons could be included in the manuscript.\n- The proposed method has a sensitive hyperparameter of \"a number of insertion layers\". In particular, Section 3.2 emphasizes the risk of early insertion layers, while the ablation study in Section 4.3 emphasizes the importance of increasing the number of insertion layers. I think the manuscript could provide more explanation on the choice of the hyperparameter. \n\n[1] Li et al., Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models, ICML 2023\n[2] Liu et al., Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744"

                        "value": "We sincerely appreciate your valuable reviews and recognition of our work. We hope our response can address your concerns.\n\n---\n> **Q1: Treating BLIP-2 as the baseline to LLaMA-Adapter for multi-modal evaluation**\n\n>\nThanks for your advice! BLIP-2 is a good and widely adopted baseline for existing multi-modal LLMs. However, please note that it is ***not appropriate*** to judge the capability of our approach solely based on BLIP-2's MME performance. The two reasons are as follows.\n\n1. **Targeting on Different Capabilities.** Our LLaMA-Adapter, along with the concurrent LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, all aim to acquire the ***visual instruction-following capacity***, namely, following human instructions to generate human-like answers conditioned on image input. In contrast, BLIP-2 focuses on the ***fundamental vision-language understanding capability***. Therefore, the former visual instruction models tend to output long and detailed sentences like human conversations of daily life, while the latter BLIP-2 prefers to generate accurate answers with concise language.\n\n2. **Evaluation Bias in MME.** MME mainly evaluates the fundamental perception and cognition abilities of multi-modal LLMs, for which the ground-truth answer contains only one word: \"Yes\" or \"No\". As analyzed above, such short-answer evaluation is more advantageous to BLIP-2 than visual instruction models (LLaMA-Adapter, LLaVA, and MiniGPT-4). For example, MiniGPT-4 is instruction-tuned based on the pre-trained vision encoder and Q-Former of BLIP-2, while performing worse than BLIP-2 in MME, as shown in the table below. In addition, InstructBLIP [1] further conducts instruction tuning upon the pre-trained BLIP-2, and also underperforms BLIP-2 on MME.\n| Method | MME |  |  | MMBench |  |  |  |  |  |  | MM-Vet |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|---|:-:|---|---|:-:|---|---|---|---|---|---|:-:|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|  | **All** | P | C | **All** | LR | AR | RR | FP-S | FP-C | CP | **All** |Rec | OCR | Know | Gen | Spat | Math |\n| BLIP2 | 1584 | 1294 | 290 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 22.4 |27.5 | 11.1 | 11.8 | 7.0 | 16.2 | 5.8 |\n| InstructBLIP | 1505 | 1213 | 292 | 33.9 | 21.6 | 47.4 | 22.5 | 33.0 | 24.4 | 41.1 | 26.2 |32.4 | 14.6 | 16.5 | 18.2 | 18.6 | 7.7 |\n| Mini-GPT4 | 1159 | 867 | 292 | 23.0 | 13.6 | 32.9 | 8.9 | 28.7 | 11.2 | 28.3 | 22.1 |27.5 | 11.1 | 11.8 | 7.0 | 16.2 | 5.8 |\n| LLaVA | 718 | 503 | 215 | 36.2 | 15.9 | 53.6 | 28.6 | 41.8 | 20.0 | 40.4 | 23.8 | 28.0 | 17.1 | 16.3 | 18.9 | 21.2 | 11.5 |\n| LLaMA-Adapter | 1222 | 973 | 249 | 39.5 | 13.1 | 47.4 | 23.0 | 45.0 | 33.2 | 50.6 | 32.8 |38.5 | 20.3 | 31.4 | 33.4 | 22.9 | 3.8 |\n\n\nTherefore, ***the instruction-following ability of visual instruction models***, e.g., LLaMA-Adapter, ***cannot be entirely reflected by MME scores***. Instead, on other multi-modal benchmarks, e.g., MMBench [2] and MM-Vet [3], our approach exhibits significant advantages over BLIP-2 or BLIP-2-based instruction models (InstructBLIP and MiniGPT-4):\n\n1. **MMBench** [2] comprehensively measures 20 vision-language reasoning tasks with three levels of ability dimensions. MMBench introduces a new CircularEval strategy by using ChatGPT, which converts free-form predictions into pre-defined choices to alleviate the bias for BLIP-2. As shown in the table above, our LLaMA-Adapter showcases a clear advantage to BLIP-2-based instruction models.\n\n2. **MM-Vet** [3] examines 6 core vision-language capabilities with 16 kinds of integration. It introduces an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended outputs, which thoroughly measures the answering performance of visual instruction models. As shown in the table above, our LLaMA-Adapter also performs much better than BLIP-2.\n\n#### Reference:\n#### [1] InstructBLIP: Towards General-purpose Vision-Language Models with Instruction Tuning. arXiv 2023.\n#### [2] MMBench: Is Your Multi-modal Model an All-around Player?. arXiv 2023.\n#### [3] MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities. arXiv 2023."

                        "value": "> **Q2:  More evidence to show the proposed method is still effective and efficient in the multi-modal domain**\n\n>\nThanks for your advice! There have been many advanced multi-modal LLMs released very recently within several months. They incorporate ***a larger number of vision-language data*** for visual instruction tuning. For example, InstructBLIP (16M) and LLaVA-1.5 (665K) [4] collect visual question-answering data from a wide range of tasks for joint training. Note that LLaVA-1.5 was released on ***5th October 2023***, which is later than ICLR\u2019s submission deadline, ***27th September 2023***.\n\nIn contrast, our multi-modal LLaMA-Adapter reported in the paper only adopts the basic Alpaca and LLaVA-I as the instruction data (210K). To fully unleash the potential of LLaMA-Adapter, we further add **VQAv2 (204K)** [5] into the instruction data for jointly tuning our model, denoted termed as LLaMA-Adapter$^\\dagger$ in the following table. We evaluate LLaMA-Adapter$^\\dagger$ on four multi-modal benchmarks: **MME**, **MMBench**, **LVLM-eHub**, and **MM-Vet** as follows. \n| Method | MME |  |  | MMBench |  |  |  |  |  |  | LVLM-eHub |  |  |  |  | MM-Vet |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|---|:-:|---|---|:-:|---|---|---|---|---|---|:-:|---|---|---|---|:-:|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|  | **All** | P | C | **All** | LR | AR | RR | FP-S | FP-C | CP | **All** | VP | VKA | VR | VC | **All** | Rec | OCR | Know | Gen | Spat | Math |\n| BLIP2 | 1584 | 1294 | 290 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 0.77 | 0.86 | 0.93 | 0.76 | 0.54 | 22.4 | 27.5 | 11.1 | 11.8 | 7.0 | 16.2 | 5.8 |\n| InstructBLIP | 1505 | 1213 | 292 | 33.9 | 21.6 | 47.4 | 22.5 | 33.0 | 24.4 | 41.1 | 0.95 | 0.93 | 0.97 | 0.91 | 0.99 | 26.2 | 32.4 | 14.6 | 16.5 | 18.2 | 18.6 | 7.7 |\n| Mini-GPT4 | 1159 | 867 | 292 | 23.0 | 13.6 | 32.9 | 8.9 | 28.7 | 11.2 | 28.3 | 0.55 | 0.73 | 0.35 | 0.53 | 0.57 | 22.1 | 27.5 | 11.1 | 11.8 | 7.0 | 16.2 | 5.8 |\n| LLaVA | 718 | 503 | 215 | 36.2 | 15.9 | 53.6 | 28.6 | 41.8 | 20.0 | 40.4 | 0.64 | 0.62 | 0.38 | 0.77 | 0.79 | 23.8 | 28.0 | 17.1 | 16.3 | 18.9 | 21.2 | 11.5 |\n| LLaVA-1.5 | 1826 | 1531 | 295 | 59.5 | 32.4 | 72.6 | 49.3 | 62.3 | 52.2 | 67.7 | - | - | - | - | - | 30.5 | - | - | - | - | - | - |\n| LLaMA-Adapter | 1222 | 973 | 249 | 39.5 | 13.1 | 47.4 | 23.0 | 45.0 | 33.2 | 50.6 | 0.67 | 0.81 | 0.44 | 0.83 | 0.59 | 31.4 | 38.5 | 20.3 | 31.4 | 33.4 | 22.9 | 3.8 |\n| LLaMA-Adapter$^\\dagger$ | 1618 | 1272 | 346 | 60.1 | 34.7 | 65.3 | 48.7 | 63.1 | 57.3 | 69.3 | 0.72 | 0.86 | 0.44 | 0.92 | 0.65 | 32.8 | 38.9 | 20.8 | 27.4 | 29.9 | 28.5 | 11.5 |\n\nAs shown above, our LLaMA-Adapter$^\\dagger$ consistently attains better results than the original version. This indicates the potential of our approach to achieve better performance with more instruction-tuning data. Compared to the latest InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5, our approach can attain competitive results, while using ***less instruction tuning data*** and adopting ***parameter-efficient tuning***. This demonstrates our method is still effective and efficient in the multi-modal domain.\n\n---\n> **Q3:  More quantitative comparisons with Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRA**\n\n>\nThanks for your advice! Besides qualitative results, we have compared them on the GPT-4 evaluation benchmark [6] in ***Figure 5 of the paper***, which utilizes GPT-4 to assess the response quality on 80 questions. As you suggested, we further evaluate the language processing capacity of the three methods on ***Open LLM benchmark*** [7]. It evaluates LLMs' generative abilities in four different tasks: AI2 Reasoning Challenge [8], HellaSwag [9], MMLU [10], and TruthfulQA [11]. Each task contains challenging data samples over a wide range of knowledge domains.\n\nAs shown in the table below, LLaMA-Adapter still achieves the best average performance than Alpaca's full fine-tuning and Alpaca-LoRA. This demonstrates the strong language instruction-following ability of our approach.\n| Method | Avg | ARC | HellaSwag | MMLU | TruthfulQA |\n|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| Alpaca | 49.2 | 49.1 | 77.7 | 33.8 | 36.3 |\n| Alpaca-LoRA | 50.7 | 53.0 | 77.9 | 37.1 | 34.9 |\n| LLaMA-Adapter | 52.2 | 54.7 | 78.8 | 34.9 | 40.4 |\n\n#### Reference:\n#### [4] Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning. arXiv 2023.\n#### [5] Making the V in VQA Matter: Elevating the Role of Image Understanding in Visual Question Answering.

                        "value": "> **Q4: More explanation on the choice of the \"number of insertion layers\"**\n\n>\nSorry for the confusion caused. Inserting prompts with zero-initialized attention into higher transformer layers is better than earlier layers. This is because it's more effective to inject the instructional cues into layers capturing higher-level semantics for language generation. There also exists an optimal insertion layer number, since too few layers might underfit the training data, while too many layers would adversely disturb the early encoding of input words.\n\nWe conduct an ablation study for the insertion layer numbers on ScienceQA in the table below. As shown, inserting at the ***last 30 layers*** is better than the ***early 30 layers*** or ***all 32 layers***. Also, if one has limited resources to identify the best insertion layer number, simply inserting our modules into all transformer layers would generally be a good solution.\n| Layers| Params|Val Acc.\n|:---|:---:|:---\n|Last 30|1.79|83.85\n|Early 30|1.79|79.69\n|All 32|1.83|81.03\n\n\n---\n> **Q5: In equation 7, what happens when g grows bigger than 1?**\n\n>\nThanks for pointing out! In actual implementation, we add a *tanh* activation function to the gating factor $g$, which regulates its scale to into -1$\\sim$1. This well controls the impact (in both forward and reverse directions) of adaption prompts to the pre-trained attention mechanism. We have added the description in the revised manuscript.\n\n---\n> **Q6: The method has few learnable parameters. How about the possibility of learning large-scale data or tasks?**\n\n>\nThanks for your advice! It is very necessary to evaluate the scalability of our LLaMA-Adapter for more data and tasks.\n\n1. ***More Instruction Data.*** By default, we utilize a combination of Alpaca's data (52K) and LLaVA-I (158K) for visual instruction tuning. Here, we progressively add more question-answering data to enlarge the instruction datasets of LLaMA-Adapter: the sampled **83K VQAv2** by LLaVA-1.5 and the entire **204K VQAv2**. As shown in the table below, the increasing instruction tuning data contributes to better multi-modal reasoning results on all benchmarks, demonstrating our method\u2019s favorable scalability to a larger amount of data.\n| Data Size | MME ||  | MMBench |  |  |  |  |  |  | LVLM-eHub |  |  |  |  |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| LLaMA-Adapter | **All** |P | C | **All** | LR | AR | RR | FP-S | FP-C | CP | **All** | VP | VKA | VR | VC |\n| Alpaca+LLaVA-I |1222| 973 | 249 |39.5| 13.1 | 47.4 | 23.0 | 45.0 | 33.2 | 50.6 |0.67| 0.81 | 0.44 | 0.83 | 0.59 |\n| +VQAv2 (83K) |1256| 1007 | 249 |43.4| 22.9 | 44.7 | 31.3 | 46.7 | 46.9 | 50.3 |0.69| 0.84 | 0.42 | 0.88 | 0.63 |\n| +VQAv2 (204K) |1618| 1272 | 346 |60.1| 34.7 | 65.3 | 48.7 | 63.1 | 57.3 | 69.3 |0.72| 0.86 | 0.44 | 0.92 | 0.65 |\n\n2. ***More Learning Tasks.*** As shown in the paper and rebuttal, our LLaMA-Adapter has superior generalization capacity over a wide range of tasks, including ***language instruction following***, e.g., question answering and code generation, ***multi-modal reasoning tasks***, e.g., visual question answering and image captioning, and ***fine-tuning conventional vision or language models***. For example, in the table below, we report the specific results on the task of optical character recognition (***OCR***) on several benchmarks: DocVQA [12], TextVQA [13], and OCR-VQA [14]. As shown, our LLaMA-Adapter achieves competitive performance compared to other methods. The experiments indicate that, given a small number of learnable parameters, our approach is generalizable to comprehend diverse vision-language tasks.\n| Datasets | LLaMA-Adapter | LLaVA | MiniGPT-4 | BLIP2 |\n|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| DocVQA | 8.13 | 6.26 | 2.65 | 4.75 | \n| TextVQA | 43.76 | 38.92 | 19.40 | 31.98 | \n| OCR-VQA | 38.12 | 23.40 | 16.85 | 38.85 | \n\n#### Reference:\n#### [12] DocVQA: A Dataset for VQA on Document Images.

Due to the limited time period of rebuttal, we apply our LLaMA-Adapter (including the adaption prompts and zero-initialized attention) to the latest LLM: ***LLaMA-2-7B*** [1]. LLaMA-2 is a stronger LLM that outperforms LLaMA on a wide range of tasks. For a more comprehensive evaluation, we tune the multi-modal variant of our approach, and evaluate it on three widely-adopted benchmarks: MME, MMBench, and LVLM-eHub. As shown in the table below, our approach can achieve higher visual instruction-following results with the stronger LLaMA-2.

Besides the regular evaluation in ***Table 3 of the paper***, it is very necessary to explore the counterfactual reasoning abilities and object hallucination issues of multi-modal LLMs. As you suggested, we respectively evaluate our multi-modal LLaMA-Adapter on two suggested benchmarks as follows.\n\n1. **C-VQA** [2] for counterfactual reasoning. C-VQA contains 2k counterfactual question and answer pairs, which are collected from VQAv2 [3] and supplemented by ChatGPT. As shown in the table below, for three groups of questions, LLaMA-Adapter performs comparably to the concurrent LLaVA. Especially for the ***Numerical indirect*** questions, our approach achieves the best counterfactual reasoning results (34.3) and the least performance loss (5.6$\\downarrow$) than all other models.\nMethod|Numerical direct$\\uparrow$ (Loss$\\downarrow$)|Numerical indirect$\\uparrow$ (Loss$\\downarrow$)|Boolean$\\uparrow$ (Loss$\\downarrow$)\n-|:-:|:-:|:-:\nViperGPT|80.6 (19.4$\\downarrow$)|31.6 (68.4$\\downarrow$)|21.6 (72.4$\\downarrow$)\nLLaVA-7B|27.0 (9.9$\\downarrow$)|25.0 (15.2$\\downarrow$)|58.5 (4.8$\\downarrow$)\nLLaVA-13B|24.8 (11.9$\\downarrow$)|20.8 (21.2$\\downarrow$)|56.3 (4.7$\\downarrow$)\nLLaMA-Adapter-7B|30.1 (5.8$\\downarrow$)|34.3 (5.6$\\downarrow$)|45.8 (14.5$\\downarrow$)\n\n2. ***POPE*** [4] for object hallucinations. POPE evaluates object hallucinations as a binary classification task, and includes 500 images from MSCOCO with 6 questions per sample. As shown in the table below, for different evaluation settings, LLaMA-Adapter with LLaMA-7B attains competitive accuracy compared to other multi-modal LLMs with LLaMA-13B, which indicates our relatively stronger robustness to object hallucination problems.\nMethod|Random|Popular|Adversarial\n-|:-:|:-:|:-:\nmPLUG-Owl-7B|53.30|50.63|50.67\nLLaVA-13B|54.43|52.43|50.77\nMM-GPT-7B|50.03|50.00|50.00\nLLaMA-Adapter-7B|75.47|60.43|60.66\n\n#### Reference:\n#### [1] Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models. arXiv 2023.\n#### [2] What If the TV Was Off?

                        "value": "> **Q3: It's better to test the scalability of the method, e.g., using a larger base model or more instruction tuning data**\n\n>\nThanks for your suggestion! As you suggested, we evaluate the scalability of our LLaMA-Adapter from two aspects: base model size and instruction data size.\n\n1. **Base Model Size.** In the original paper, we conduct all experiments with LLaMA-7B. To scale up the base model, we further implement LLaMA-Adapter with a larger LLaMA-13B, and compare the results on three benchmarks as follows. On most tasks, LLaMA-13B attains better performance than LLaMA-7B, which demonstrates that our approach can be flexibly adapted to larger LLMs for potentially better multi-modal instruction-following capacity.\n| LLM Size|MME ||  | MMBench |  |  |  |  |  |  | LVLM-eHub |  |  |  |  |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| LLaMA-Adapter | **All** |P | C | **All** | LR | AR | RR | FP-S | FP-C | CP | **All** | VP | VKA | VR | VC |\n| w LLaMA-7B |1222| 973 | 249 |39.5| 13.1 | 47.4 | 23.0 | 45.0 | 33.2 | 50.6 |0.67| 0.81 | 0.44 | 0.83 | 0.59 |\n| w LLaMA-13B |1299|1021|278|40.1|13.9|47.4|23.7|46.1|34.2|51.2|0.64|0.82|0.39|0.85|0.50|\n\n\n2. **Instruction Data Size.** By default, we utilize a combination of Alpaca's data (52K) and LLaVA-I (158K) for visual instruction tuning. Here, we progressively add more question-answering data to enlarge the instruction datasets of LLaMA-Adapter: the sampled ***83K VQAv2*** by LLaVA-1.5 [5] and the entire ***204K VQAv2***. As shown in the table below, the increasing instruction tuning data leads to better multi-modal reasoning results on three benchmarks, demonstrating our method\u2019s favorable scalability to data size.\n| Data Size | MME ||  | MMBench |  |  |  |  |  |  | LVLM-eHub |  |  |  |  |\n|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| LLaMA-Adapter | **All** |P | C | **All** | LR | AR | RR | FP-S | FP-C | CP | **All** | VP | VKA | VR | VC |\n| Alpaca+LLaVA-I |1222| 973 | 249 |39.5| 13.1 | 47.4 | 23.0 | 45.0 | 33.2 | 50.6 |0.6675| 0.81 | 0.44 | 0.83 | 0.59 |\n| +VQAv2 (83K) |1256| 1007 | 249 |43.4| 22.9 | 44.7 | 31.3 | 46.7 | 46.9 | 50.3 |0.6925| 0.84 | 0.42 | 0.88 | 0.63 |\n| +VQAv2 (204K) |1618| 1272 | 346 |60.1| 34.7 | 65.3 | 48.7 | 63.1 | 57.3 | 69.3 |0.7175| 0.86 | 0.44 | 0.92 | 0.65 |\n\n\n#### Reference:\n#### [5] Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning. arXiv 2023."
