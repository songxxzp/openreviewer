Cooperative game theory is used to understand and interpret the key components of TSCL. It is shown that for every TSCL problem, there exists an equivalent cooperative game, and the learning progression objective and the teacher bandit policy in TSCL methods can be interpreted as an approximation of player marginal contribution and a fair allocation mechanism, respectively. The experiments show that the ordered value-proportional curriculum mechanism proposed can consistently find an (near-) optimal curriculum even when TSCL fails. It is also shown that in settings with significant negative interactions, TSCL cannot produce good curricula."

Using cooperative game theory to analyse how the teacher-student interactions affect the performance of the curriculum that are found by TSCL algorithms is very interesting. \n- The experimental results seem to show that the proposed game-theoretic and data-centric interpretation of TSCL can be applied to some simple supervised learning and reinforcement learning problems to understand the conditions under which TSCL is effective."

Given a TSCL problem, it does not seem straightforward to use the game-theoretic analysis presented to understand when and how TSCL works. It is also not clear to me if the formal grounding provided here is more/less useful compared to existing works that aim to understand when and how curriculum learning works as mentioned in the paper (e.g., Wu et al. (2020) and Lee et al. (2021))\n- As acknowledged in the paper, all experiments only consider a very small number of \"units of experience\". In most complex RL tasks, the learner algorithm needs access to hundreds and thousands of units of experience. I do not see how the theory presented can help analyse the TSCL approaches in these more complex settings, such as understanding the conditions under which TSCL is effective. \n- This is a minor problem with respect to the presentation of the paper. I personally found the extensive use of italic type text quite distracting when reading the paper."

The main result seems to just be that the Nowak & Radzik values estimated is in line with folk knowledge that an optimal curriculum exists. Given a particular TSCL method, how do you use a similar analysis to evaluate if the curriculum found by the given TSCL method is useful or not?\n- It is mentioned that the experimental result in classical games \"contrasts with folk knowledge in population-based training\". How to interpret this result? It should be briefly summarised in the main paper. \n- Can you explain the practical use of analysing TSCL algorithms from the proposed game-theoretic and data-centric perspective?"

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for highlighting our work's originality and overall significance for an important problem that we agree receives little attention in the literature.\n\n**Usefulness**: We would like to understand the reviewer\u2019s point about the usefulness of our approach when contrasted to previous work. As mentioned in the manuscript, ourlly differs work fundamenta from Wu et al. [1] and Lee et al [2]. Both works are (computationally expensive) empirical investigations of the effect of curricula while ours introduces a systematic and formal approach, grounded in game-theoretic arguments, to investigate TSCL. We believe the main contribution of our work is foundational.  We hope it serves as a starting point to better understand the problem space and develop novel algorithmic contributions that address the issues we uncovered.\n\n**Scalability and Computational Limitations**: We share the reviewers\u2019 concerns about the scalability of our work. Our experiments considered a small number of units as cooperative solution concepts are computationally hard problems with well-known complexity classes [1]. However, the central argument of our work is that, whether we can efficiently compute these solution concepts or not, the cooperative game among units of experience that we develop reveals the impact data has on TSCL's capacity to find curriculum in relatively simple settings. \n\n[1] Deng, Xiaotie, and Christos H. Papadimitriou. \u201cOn the Complexity of Cooperative Solution Concepts.\u201d Mathematics of Operations Research, vol. 19, no. 2, 1994, pp. 257\u201366, \n\n**The RL Setting**: The particular case of RL that the reviewer alludes highlights one of the main contributions of our work, the concept of unit of experience. Through this abstraction, we unveil the cooperative game that happens at different levels (i.e., instances, batches, trajectories, tasks/environments or benchmarks). As the reviewer correctly points out, the learner has access to thousands of units at the instance level. Undoubtedly, computing the exact effect of every unit on the learner at that level is intractable. However, the problem becomes computationally more tractable as the abstraction level increases. Our notion of a unit of experience and the cooperative game we unveil equally applies to every level. Moreover, our proposition could also explain the effectiveness of other strategies in RL, like Prioritized Experience Replay [1], that compute similar estimates at the instance level. However, we do not investigate this connection in this work and leave it to future investigations.\n\n[1] Schaul, Tom, et al. \u201cPrioritized Experience Replay.\u201d 4th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2016.\n\n**Our Work & Population-based Training**: As we explained in Appendix B, if one interprets TSCL as a meta-strategy solver over a population of opponents, our results of selecting TitForTat instead of AlwaysDefect contrast with other meta-strategy solver methods [1] that prescribe playing against the (meta) Nash (strongest strategy) of the population. While we consider this an exciting finding, we deferred it to the appendices due to a space constraint. \n\n[1] Lanctot, Marc, et al. \u201cA Unified Game-Theoretic Approach to Multiagent Reinforcement Learning.\u201d Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017\n\n**RL Experiments & TSCL failures**: It is correct that the estimated Nowak & Radzik values align with folk knowledge that an optimal curriculum exists. To our knowledge, this grounded quantification is novel. Moreover, and to the reviewer\u2019s central argument, what validates the idea of \u201chow units interactions impact TSCL\u201d is that using the value-proportional mechanism we derived from Nowak & Radzik values, we can find curriculum in this task, while the multi-armed bandit approach fails to do so (Fig. 3b). The results from Nowak & Radzik interaction metric further confirms this analysis (Fig. 4b).\n\n**Minor**: We apologize for our excessive use of italics to highlight concepts and ideas throughout the paper. We have significantly scaled back their use in the updated version of the manuscript."

The set of experiences presented by the teacher to the learner, as well as their order, influence the performance of the curriculum in TSCL. The paper demonstrates that for every TSCL problem, there exists an equivalent cooperative game, and key components of the TSCL framework can be reinterpreted using game-theoretic principles.

                        "value": "**Comparison to Existing Algorithms**: The field of curriculum learning, and approaches that adopt the teacher-student framework, is vast [1, 2] and algorithms are evaluated on a wide range of dissimilar tasks. In many cases, the notion of curriculum among those tasks are not clear. In our experimental setting, we favored the evaluation across different machine learning paradigms to showcase the broad applicability of our framework. From an algorithmic perspective, we selected the multi-armed bandit approach as it is in foundational work on TSCL [3,4] and is commonly utilized through the literature [5,6,7,8]. If the reviewer has suggestions on what algorithm/family of algorithms within TSCL would be better suited for this comparison, we would gladly consider it.\n\n**Simplicity of the Tasks**: We agree with the reviewer that the tasks we selected are relatively simple. However, there is a notion of curriculum among them. Moreover, as our experiments highlight, even in those simple tasks, multi-armed bandit approaches to TSCL fail to uncover the existent curriculum. It is not unreasonable to assume that these results will hold for more complicated tasks where the interactions among them are less straightforward.\n\n[1] Soviany, Petru, et al. \u201cCurriculum Learning: A Survey.\u201d International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 130, no. 6, June 2022, pp. 1526\u201365, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-022-01611-x.\n\n[2] Wang, Xin, et al. \u201cA Survey on Curriculum Learning.\u201d IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 44, no. 9, Sept. 2022, pp. 4555\u201376, https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3069908.\n \n[3] Graves, Alex, et al. \u201cAutomated Curriculum Learning for Neural Networks.\u201d Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, edited by Doina Precup and Yee Whye Teh, vol. 70, PMLR, 2017, pp. 1311\u201320, https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/graves17a.html.\n\n[4] Matiisen, Tambet, et al. \u201cTeacher-Student Curriculum Learning.\u201d IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, vol. 31, no. 9, Sept. 2020, pp. 3732\u201340, https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2934906.\n\n[5] Colas, C\u00e9dric, et al. \u201cLanguage as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven Exploration.\u201d arXiv [cs.AI], 21 Feb. 2020, http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09253. arXiv.\n\n[6] Portelas, R\u00e9my, et al. \u201cTeacher Algorithms for Curriculum Learning of Deep RL in Continuously Parameterized Environments.\u201d arXiv [cs.LG], 16 Oct. 2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07224. arXiv.\n\n[7] Racaniere, Sebastien, et al. \u201cAutomated Curricula through Setter-Solver Interactions.\u201d arXiv [cs.LG], 27 Sept. 2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12892. arXiv.\n\n[8] Turchetta, Matteo, et al. \u201cSafe Reinforcement Learning via Curriculum Induction.\u201d Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 33, 2020, pp. 12151\u201362"

The paper proposed a data-centric view of the learning process and treat each learning sample as a unit of experience, which could be a batch, dataset, or even an environment. Then each unit of experience is formulated as a player in the game-theoretical framework. The paper considered teacher as an agent to select unit of experience over time with the goal of steering learner's policy to meet some target objective, e.g., maximize performance on a target evaluation set. Using multi-armed bandit as the selection policy for unit of experience, the paper argued that curriculum learning achieves monotonic model improvement when the game is cooperative in nature. Extensive experiments on supervised learning, reinforcement learning among others demonstrate that the new game-theoretic angle is indeed helpful in gaining better insight of curriculum learning."

This makes the paper somewhat weak and less satisfying.\n\n(2) The framework proposed in this paper is nice and elegant, but I am very concerned about the practical side of the methodology - it requires training a model multiple times and evaluating the value of each unit of experience. This is very time consuming if each unit of experience is a large dataset or an RL environment. Therefore, it limits the generalizability of the proposed approach."

However, we considered this connection and further alternative theoretical investigations outside of the scope of the present work. There is a significant communication complexity in presenting ideas at the intersection of these three generally disconnected fields. As the reviewer mentioned, our work presents a foundational framework to further study TSCL and its relationship with other areas like continual learning, transfer learning, or multitask learning under cooperative game-theoretic ideas. That\u2019s why we believe our results warrants further communication to the community.\n\nThe revised version of the manuscript now more clearly points to these more theoretical avenues that should be a continuation of the path we have outlined here.\n\n**Scalability & Computational Limitations**: We share the reviewers\u2019 concerns about the scalability of our work. Undoubtedly, cooperative solution concepts are computationally-hard problems with well-known complexity classes [4]. However, recent advances [5, 6] make us hope to obtain better approximations of the cooperative game we designed. On the other hand, the central argument of our work is that, whether we can efficiently compute these solution concepts or not, the cooperative game among units of experience that we develop impacts TSCL's capacity to find curriculum in relatively simple settings. We believe our work should serve as a starting point to develop novel algorithmic contributions that address the problems this data-centric perspective uncovered.\n\n[1] Shapley, Lloyd S. \u201cCores of Convex Games.\u201d International Journal of Game Theory, 1971\n\n[2] Bach, Francis. \u201cLearning with Submodular Functions: A Convex Optimization Perspective.\u201d \n\n[3] Dughmi, Shaddin. \u201cSubmodular Functions: Extensions, Distributions, and Algorithms.

In many cases, the notion of curriculum among those tasks is not clear. In our experimental setting, we selected the multi-armed bandit approach as it is the foundational work on TSCL [3,4] and it is commonly utilized through the literature [5,6,7,8]. If the reviewer has some suggestions on what algorithm/family of algorithms within TSCL would better suited for this comparison, we would gladly consider it.\n\n[1] Soviany, Petru, et al. \u201cCurriculum Learning: A Survey.\u201d International Journal of Computer Vision, vol. 130, no. 6, June 2022, pp. 1526\u201365, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-022-01611-x.\n\n[2] Wang, Xin, et al. \u201cA Survey on Curriculum Learning.\u201d IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol. 44, no. 9, Sept. 2022, pp. 4555\u201376, https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3069908.\n \n[3] Graves, Alex, et al. \u201cAutomated Curriculum Learning for Neural Networks.\u201d Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning, edited by Doina Precup and Yee Whye Teh, vol. 70, PMLR, 2017, pp. 1311\u201320, https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/graves17a.html.\n\n[4] Matiisen, Tambet, et al. \u201cTeacher-Student Curriculum Learning.\u201d IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, vol. 31, no. 9, Sept. 2020, pp. 3732\u201340, https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2934906.\n\n[5] Colas, C\u00e9dric, et al. \u201cLanguage as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven Exploration.\u201d arXiv [cs.AI], 21 Feb. 2020, http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09253. arXiv.\n\n[6] Portelas, R\u00e9my, et al. \u201cTeacher Algorithms for Curriculum Learning of Deep RL in Continuously Parameterized Environments.\u201d arXiv [cs.LG], 16 Oct. 2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07224. arXiv.\n\n[7] Racaniere, Sebastien, et al. \u201cAutomated Curricula through Setter-Solver Interactions.\u201d arXiv [cs.LG], 27 Sept. 2019, http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12892. arXiv.\n\n[8] Turchetta, Matteo, et al. \u201cSafe Reinforcement Learning via Curriculum Induction.\u201d Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, vol. 33, 2020, pp. 12151\u201362"
