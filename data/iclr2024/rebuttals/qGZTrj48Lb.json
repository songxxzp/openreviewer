Besides, Many implementation details in their iterative generation pipeline are missing, such as the value of V_{max}, T, N, M, etc.\n\n2. This paper focus on text-to-video generation, where video quality (IS, FVD) achieves the best performance on UCF101. However, the alignment between the input sentence and the generated video is not evaluated. Many previous papers report CLIPSIM on MSRVTT dataset to measure video-language alignment. It would be better to report this number and make a comparison. Besides, it would be better to have human evaluation metrics for different methods.\n\n3. Since many classes between UCF101 and Kinetics700 are overlapped, it makes the comparison in Table 1 not fair enough. The authors can manually remove all classes which overlap with the Kinetics-400 dataset similar to the zero-shot action recognition settings[1].\n\n4. the iterative generation idea is lack of novelty, similar idea has been proposed in [2]. \n\n[1] Doshi et al., Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Transformer-based Video Semantic Embedding, CVPR 2023 Workshop\n[2] Harvey et al.

However, FNR reverses the noise of the previously generated frames, which I think would contradict the temporal flow of the video. For example, for video frames f_n-2, f_n-1, f_n, f_n+1, f_n+2, letting f_n-2 and f_n-1 be already generated conditioned frames, in FNR, the conditioned frames for generating f_n, f_n+1, f_n+2 would be f_n-1, f_n-2 rather than f_n-2, f_n-1, where the temporal order is reversed. I think the authors should give more explanation here as to why the reversed order is better.\n- [experiment] Only experimental results on UCF101 are provided, while other baselines compared the zero-shot MSRVTT performance, which I think this paper should also follow.\n- [experiment] No user study comparison is presented."

By injecting some 3D temporal layers into LDM, an initial video clip can be generated by such temporal-aware LDM. The following frames are produced iteratively by reusing the latent features of the previous clip and imitating the previous diffusion process. For iterative generation, VidRD applies Frame-level Noise Reversion (FNR) to reuse the initial noise in reverse order from the previous video clip, a Past-dependent Noise\nSampling (PNS) scheme that brings a new random noise for the last several video frames, and a Denoising with Staged Guidance (DSG) strategy to refine temporal consistencies between video clips. For the autoencoder used for translating between pixel space and latent space, the authors inject temporal layers into its decoder and fine-tune these layers for higher temporal consistency. The authors also introduce a set of strategies for composing video-text data that involve diverse content from multiple existing datasets, including action recognition and image-text datasets."

Also, the generated motion still looks a bit simple in most cases. Some visual details can be further ameliorated. Providing more discussions and analyses on these could strengthen this paper further.\n\n- Regarding the experiment evaluation, since the currently used metrics for evaluating video generation models are not fully reliable and may be inconsistent with human perception, a user study is highly recommended to be included to make the quantitative evaluation more reliable.\n\n- The reviewer is a bit confused about the primary motivation of the paper. The paper just highlights the importance of producing more frames for long video generation at first, while some modules are also designed to enhance temporal continuity and quality. The authors also mentioned the efficient training of the proposed method but lacked the actual analysis.\n\n- The reviewer is interested in the computational and memory cost of the proposed strategy as the authors also mentioned such cost is a formidable challenge for text-to-video generation. Providing more statistics, analyses, and discussions can be useful.\n\n- Since the authors claim the video-text data composition as one of the contributions, the reviewer is interested in the accuracy of the captioning and the quality of the data. Providing more evaluation and analysis of the data and captions to demonstrate their merits is beneficial.\n\n- The paper writing can be further improved.
