Perhaps this is a tangent but demonstrating properties of this distance would have been great. This distance is a strength though because of the strength inherent to Wasserstein distance. It could perhaps be well applied in future works.\n\n\nMinor comment: the conclusions start with a typo \"W\""

                        "value": "Thank you for your insightful review. Here are our answers to your questions:\n1. The distances $d_{sik}$ are indeed between $x^{si}$ and the potential representative point $\\zeta^{k}$. Only after $\\gamma^k$ is found to be 1, the point $\\zeta^k$ will become one of the $z^j$'s.\n2. Our findings indicate that the gap is negligible for most examples we tested. For your information, the upper bound of the duality gap is recorded in Table 3 as well. In the worst-case scenario, even if the gap is substantial, our approach outperforms random particle selection, as seen in particle filter algorithms. One point that requires clarification is our assertion that \"for large dimensions, the gap is minimal, as our experience demonstrates.\" Here, we specifically refer to the dimensions of primal variables $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ and dual variables $\\theta$. It's important to note that the dimensions of particles x and z do not directly impact the mixed-integer programming problem. In this context, the distance matrix between x and z contains the coefficients we need for the computation. This rationale underlines why we consider a numerical example on a Gaussian mixture distribution more appropriate for comparing the performances of the subgradient method and the integer programming solver. In this example, we have the flexibility to increase the dimensions of primal and dual variables, and the selected particles by both methods can be easily visualized."

However, such a relaxation will usually induce large optimization error. Besides, the authors claim that \"However, for large dimensions, the gap is minimal, as our experience demonstrates.\" When I look at the numerical results in Table 2, the optimization gap actually increases when the data dimension increases. Therefore, I think Section 3 does not present a reasonable approach for optimization. \n- Several citations are missing. For example, in the last paragraph of Section 2, the authors introduced particle selection problem using the Wasserstein distance but did not include a citation. It is confusing to tell the specific application or problem formulation the authors are referring to.\n- Numerical study is too stylized."

More specifically, the author proposes a Wasserstein distance between two kernels $Q$ and $\\tilde{Q}$ (definition 2.1). Then, the computationally efficient algorithm is provided and the efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in numerical problems.\n\nThe approach seems to be new. However, it has several problems needed to be addressed further. Moreover, the experimental section can be further expanded"

It seems $Q(\\dot | x)$ is a probability density function estimated and it does not look like a kernel functions. Could you please elaborate this part?\n2. Equation (9) presents a variation of the Wasserstein barycenter problem. However, the manuscript lacks a comprehensive discussion of the Wasserstein barycenter, and it would be beneficial to explicitly address this concept. Additionally, a comparison of the proposed method with relevant baselines is warranted.\n3. Numerous typographical errors are present in the manuscript. For instance, on page 1, there is a repeated \"the the.\" Equation (6) is lacking the variable $p,\" and these issues need prompt correction for the manuscript to maintain clarity and accuracy."

                        "value": "1. In probability theory, a stochastic kernel, also referred to as a Markov kernel or probability kernel, functions as a map that assumes a role akin to that of a transition matrix in the theory of finite-state Markov chains. The formal definition is: \nLet $(X, \\mathcal{A})$ and $(Y, \\mathcal{B})$ be measurable spaces. A Markov kernel with source $(X, \\mathcal{A})$ and target $(Y, \\mathcal{B})$ is a map $Q: \\mathcal{B} \\times X \\rightarrow[0,1]$ with the following properties: \n(a) For every event $B \\in \\mathcal{B}$, the map $x \\mapsto Q(B|x)$ is $\\mathcal{A}$-measurable;\n(b) For every point $x \\in X$, the map $B \\mapsto Q(B| x)$ is a probability measure on $(Y, \\mathcal{B})$.\nSome Markov kernels are indeed defined by kernel functions $k(x,y)$, such that $Q(dy|x) = k(x,y) \\mu(dy)$ with a base measure $\\mu$ on $Y$. The misunderstanding may have originated from this special case. We do not work with kernel functions.\n\n2. Equation (9) does not represent a variation of the Wasserstein barycenter problem. While our research may bear a superficial resemblance to the Wasserstein barycenter problem, our focus differs dramatically. Wasserstein barycenters offer a geometrically meaningful approach to aggregating probability distributions, grounded in optimal transport theory. However, our methodology diverges by not aiming to identify an aggregated measure that best captures multiple distributions, but rather a simplified kernel whose values approximate the values of the original kernel.  As demonstrated by Theorem 2.2 and our numerical example, our approach is directly applicable to Markov systems with multiple time stages, a scenario where the Wasserstein barycenter problem falls short. Although we cite papers related to the Wasserstein barycenter problem, they are only tangentially related to our goals.\n\n3. The two typos have been corrected. Thank you for bringing them to our attention. Regarding Equation (6), we maintain that the variable \"p\" was not missing; it features in the definition of the matrix $D$."

Thus, I wonder how the existing barycenter method performs your problem. This is not clear yet. Even though it is superficially related to barycenter, it would be great to discuss and compare with the barycenter problem. This will make a great benefit to machine learning community. \n\nSince the author clarified some misunderstandings, I would like to raise the score to 5."
