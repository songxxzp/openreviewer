                        "value": "Dear Reviewer 3Bf5,\n\nThank you for your valuable feedback. Below we address your questions and concerns.\n\n> I could not understand the novelty of this work compared to existing works, such as TASK2VEC or MODEL2VEC mentioned in the paper, which also try to embed tasks or models.\n\nThe novelty of our work is that our approach does not need access to the dataset while TASK2VEC or MODEL2VEC uses the dataset to characterize the model. \n\n> Even if modality or dataset-id could be predicted by the proposed autoencoder, I'm not sure what we can say about interpreting ANNs.\n\nWe added a conceptual figure to Introduction, which illustrates the comparison between mechanistic interpretability approaches and our approach. What we really like to propose in our work is a new approach to interpreting NNs by embedding them in a lower-dimensional space and quantitatively characterizing them in relation to other NNs. In order to make this happen, the lower-dimensional space of the models has to reflect the functional similarities of models, and we demonstrate this by successfully predicting certain properties of the task that an unseen model is trained on. \n\n> In Section 4.4, it seems to me that there is nothing to train with a k-NN classifier when the meta-encoder is frozen. What do you mean by training here?\n\nYes, you\u2019re right that there is no parameter to update when the meta-encoder is frozen. The choice of the word \u201ctrain\u201d is indeed confusing so we changed it to \u201cfit\u201d in the modified version.\n\n> Figure 1 suggests that the model to be interpreted is also an autoencoder. However, such an assumption is not clearly stated in the manuscript. It is also unclear why the encoder part of this model should be analyzed.\n\nThere is an explanation of this assumption in section 4.1. \n\n> It is unclear why we need unitwise and interunit meta-autoencoders.\n\nWe need these two types of meta-autoencoders to facilitate ability-related encoding. \nFirstly, in our experiment setting the order of the output units does not have any functional meaning because they are in an intermediate layer in the original autoencoder. Therefore, we can take a single fully connected layer as a set of filters. Although there are some studies on the autoencoding of sets, there is no standard method. In this research, we considered a set as an array by sorting it. For example, if the original weight matrix is sorted by some key, it is possible to autoencode the entire weight end to end. However, the weight space has a very large number of dimensions, making it difficult to find an appropriate key. Therefore, we first autoencode the elements of the weight matrix, embed them in a lower dimension for feature extraction, and then sorted them using these features to create a sorting key. Thus, we first trained a unit-wise meta-encoder (for filters), sorted the obtained representations along the primary dimension, concatenated them, and then used an inter-unit meta-encoder to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the set of filter representations.\n\n> (This is not a question, just a comment.) There are several works that deal directly with DNN weights as input, such as [1], which could be used to analyze trained DNN models more efficiently.\n\nWe were not aware of this work though it seems to give us some good insights on how better to embed weight matrices. Thank you so much for sharing."

The only thing I can see from here is how close two models are. \n\n2- Although the authors claim that the proposed approach can be used with any model, it appears that this may not be the case. It's unclear which layer to encode, and if we attempt to encode multiple layers, we would need different encoders due to varying input sizes. Even with the option of ReLU in section 5.3, it may be impossible for large networks. Representing an entire large network with a single-layer network doesn't seem feasible.\n\n3- In practice, users typically train a network for a specific task they don't train hundreds of networks. Consequently, it's unclear how the encoder can be trained with very few weights.\n\nMinor formatting issues:\n\n1- In the related work section, change \"Indeed\" to \"indeed\" in the sentence, \"Those latent variables are indeed a concise representation.\"\n\n2- In Section 4.1, tag the figure number instead of writing \"Figure\" so that readers can identify which figure you are referring to.\n\n3- When tagging figures, use \"Fig. 1\" instead of writing \"[1]\" for better clarity."

                        "value": "Dear Reviewer Bzy7,\n\nWe really appreciate your constructive feedback. We already modified the minor formatting issues in the paper based on your review. Below we address your questions and concerns.\n\n>The paper claims that encoding the model's weights improves interpretability, but it doesn't explain how it achieves this. It doesn't clarify how the model makes decisions or whether it reveals any general biases the model has learned.\n\nWe added a figure in our modified version, which illustrates how the metanetwork infers a property of the task an unseen model can solve. As for general biases models have learned, we showed that the model embeddings are separated according to their task property, but we have to admit that we are yet to pinpoint what exactly it is that makes them separate in that way, and figuring this out should be included in our future work.\n\n> Although the authors claim that the proposed approach can be used with any model, it appears that this may not be the case.\n\nYou are right on the point that it is quite challenging to apply our proposed methodology (unit-wise meta-encoder and inter-unit meta-encoder and so on) to any architecture of NN models. Although we didn\u2019t empirically show this in this paper, we think we can get to embed a far wider range of NNs by first converting them to the same format of three-layer NNs as we discussed in section 5.3. But as you mentioned in the feedback, it might be difficult to be applied to \u201cany\u201d architecture (that uses other activation functions or has recurrent structure for example). We might have to come up with a way to solve this issue in future work.\n\n> Can the authors provide more detailed clarification for this part: \"Therefore, if we infer the training dataset of the model using the feature visualization technique, without access to the dataset, we can obtain a low-dimensional vector representation of the model, using an\napproach similar to MeLA.\"\n\nWhat we mean by this sentence is that it has been shown that some feature visualization techniques (As discussed in [Olah et al. 2017](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)) can elicit what kind of feature is captured in a particular subnetwork of a given model, without accessing the original dataset. Also, there are some work on generating a model given a dataset ([Wu et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09912); [Ha et al. 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09106) and so on). If we combine these two together, we should be able to reconstruct the original model without using the original dataset and gain a lower dimensional representation of the model as a by-product.\n\n> Why is it necessary to use two different meta encoders? Can we use only one of them, such as either the \"unit-wise\" meta-autoencoder or the \"inter-unit\" meta-autoencoder only?\n\nWe need these two types of meta-autoencoders to facilitate ability-related encoding. \nFirstly, in our experiment setting the order of the output units does not have any functional meaning because they are in an intermediate layer in the original autoencoder. Therefore, we can take a single fully connected layer as a set of filters. Although there are some studies on the autoencoding of sets, there is no standard method. In this research, we considered a set as an array by sorting it. For example, if the original weight matrix is sorted by some key, it is possible to autoencode the entire weight end to end. However, the weight space has a very large number of dimensions, making it difficult to find an appropriate key. Therefore, we first autoencode the elements of the weight matrix, embed them in a lower dimension for feature extraction, and then sorted them using these features to create a sorting key. Thus, we first trained a unit-wise meta-encoder (for filters), sorted the obtained representations along the primary dimension, concatenated them, and then used an inter-unit meta-encoder to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the set of filter representations."
