We provide detailed responses below.\n\nQ: \u201cA standard protocol for evaluating representations \"downstream\" is to fine-tune a linear predictor or \"probe\" on top of the representations [1, 2]. The fact that the fine-tuned predictor is linear is important: it can measure how well the representations \"cluster\" [3], or linearly correlate, with downstream labels. Yet in this paper, the fine-tuned predictor is a nonlinear neural network with three layers. This raises doubts on whether the representations actually correlate with downstream labels (e.g. age), if they need to undergo many nonlinear transformations before the linear prediction layer. Could the authors comment on this?\u201d\n\nR: We agree with the reviewer that a more complex decoder can facilitate the task. However, we note that non-pretrained models are also included that serve as a baseline for predicting the clinical variables. BrainLM outperforms this baseline, showing that the unsupervised pretraining helps learn a good embedding. If the embedding learned by the model during self-supervised pretraining was suboptimal, then the non-pretrained baseline would be equally good as BrainLM, but this is not the case. As such, we can conclude that the non-linear predictor is not the primary factor driving the improved performance. We are open to incorporating results using a linear predictor if the reviewer deems it necessary, however we have no reason to believe that this will change the results qualitatively.\n\nQ:\u201dThe authors use the terminology of \"foundation model\" and \"language model\" which suggest a novel approach to analyzing fMRI recordings; yet, at its core, their model is a neural network trained with a self-supervised loss (e.g. predict random or future missing values) on fMRI recordings.

With this context, could the authors explain what contributions they make that are novel with respect to the current literature?\u201d\n\nR: We appreciate the reviewer for highlighting two relevant pieces of literature. There is an important distinction between our work and the studies presented in [4,5]. The primary focus of these papers was on employing self-supervised learning for a specific task: identifying areas in the cortex that have high correlation to GPT-2 or other large language models. Specifically, these studies observed that language processing areas were better explained by these models. This brain-scoring approach has proven successful in understanding the information used by these language models for their tasks and how they relate to different brain areas. It has also been applied to non-language areas like V1 and IT.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that none of these models were explicitly trained to model the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain recordings. Furthermore, they did not evaluate the ability of these models to generalize to the prediction of clinical variables, a distinctive feature of our work. We will incorporate these studies into the related works section and provide a stronger comparison against their approach."

The model is trained on a large corpus of data from UK BioBank, the largest fMRI data repository currently available.\n\nBrainLM shows performance superior to several benchmarks (but: see a question about those below)."

My question here I guess whether the comparison presented in the table reflects the state of the art achieved by other models in predicting certain clinical variables, and not just state of the art using a certain method. The fact that an LSTM or an SVM performs poorly is not that interesting to see, what would be interesting to see is how much better or worse performance we get when compared to the state of the art method specifically trained to predict GAD-7 for example. Same for other clinical scores, a methods does not have to predict all of them at once.

None of the models have been used for clinical variable prediction. In the literature, common approaches for clinical variable prediction involve the use of SVM and MLPs to correlation matrix input [1]. These are the models we have included in Table 2 (previous Table 3).\n\n[1] Vieira, Sandra, Walter HL Pinaya, and Andrea Mechelli. \u201cUsing deep learning to investigate the neuroimaging correlates of psychiatric and neurological disorders: Methods and applications.\u201d Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews 74 (2017): 58-75.\n\nQ: \u201cTable 3: Are the \"competitor\" results obtained by you training these methods on the same data, or these are the numbers reported in the respective studies by the authors of those methods?\u201d\n\nR: We obtained the performance of competing methods ourselves. The methods designed for clinical variable prediction were trained on other datasets, preventing us from incorporating their performance directly. Furthermore, we requested access to their code for comparison but received no response. As a result, we constructed our own baselines based on the information available in their manuscript. We did extensive hyperparameter search for each method for fairness and presented the best performance of each method in our analysis.\n\nQ: \u201cTable 1: It appears that allowing the model to see more context (less masking) yields significantly better better performance.

As such, their in-distribution performance is higher. However, when tested with other masking ratios, their performance decreases significantly.

                    "value": "My main concerns lie with the fact that the network is very modestly sized for a foundation model, and that the baselines aren't a priori motivated in a way that would support the contributed model as truly SOTA. \n\nRegarding the former, 13M parameters is smaller than the MLP, LatentODE, and LSTM baselines, and much smaller than what I would consider to be even a small foundation model. For example, HuBERT-Base is a 90M parameter model trained on ~1K hours of speech data (12 layers and 8 heads with larger dimensions than BrainLM). So while BrainLM is a model trained on a nontrivial amount of fMRI data using SSL, it is remarkably small for a foundation model. That would be fine if performance were good relative to a set of baselines chosen based on prior results on fMRI decoding, but I'm not sure if this were the case. At least, the paper does not make it obvious (for example, the NODE, LatentODE, and GCN citations point back to the original papers, none of which have neuroscience applications). Thus, the baselines are also novel, so it's unclear how impactful beating them should be. Considering that the UKB data was released in 2016 and the HCP data published in 2021, I would be surprised if there are no baselines in the literature against which the present contribution can be evaluated. Without this contextualization against past work, neither the performance numbers nor having trained a small SSL model on thousands of hours of fMRI data is sufficiently impactful for ICLR in my judgement. \n\nSome additional comments: \n* In discussion of large-scale SSL for neuroscience, the paper would benefit from also considering Kostas et al. 2021 10.3389/fnhum.2021.653659. \n* More sophisticated methods could be used for interpretability than attention maps (e.g. Chefer et al. CVPR 2021). \n* The legend for Fig. 5 has LatentODE, LSTM, and NODE whereas the text talks about ODENets and non-pretrained BrainLM. Please add the non-pretrained BrainLM results or correct the text. In addition, the text could make a clearer mapping from legend to citations (e.g. \"NODE (Chen et al.), LatentODE (Rubanova rt al.)\"). Finally, I am surprised that there is an unpretrained BrainLM baseline in table 4 but not table 3.\n* Something strange seems to be going on with NODE training -- it performs much worse than other methods and gives a large *negative* $R^2$ value in table 4 (likely indicating severe model mismatch, and giving me concern about whether training failed entirely for this model). \n* Considering the claims regarding \"springboard for accelerated research\" via a foundation model, the paper should make explicit that weights and code will be released."

                    "value": "* Was figure 3 randomly sampled or cherry-picked? \n* The generalization numbers ($R^2=0.464$ within dataset or $.278$ across) need to be contextualized -- how do we know they are good?\n* Why are the 1% and 100% training results of interest? Should we not be surprised that more data improves performance, and if it is surprising why not show a trend over more than just two data sizes? \n* 40% dropout seems quite high -- is this correct, or a typo? \n* Stats on fig 5: how were they done? Hard to imagine BrainLM beats LSTM and LatentODE at later timepoints given the visualized error bars, was it something like BrainLM vs the average of the rest such that the effect of NODE dominated? \n* What motivated the specific network architectures chosen? They vary substantially in number of parameters. \n* What were the other training details (e.g. learning rates and their schedules, dropout and other regularization for the SSL training, gradient clipping if any, etc)? These would be fine in an appendix but should be included for reproducibility."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their constructive comments and questions. We provide detailed responses below.\n\nQ: \u201cBrainLM is a model trained on a nontrivial amount of fMRI data using SSL, it is remarkably small for a foundation model.\u201d\n\nR: We appreciate the reviewer's perspective on the comparative scale of our model, especially when juxtaposed with the larger foundation models prevalent in other domains. Taking this constructive feedback into account, we have expanded our research scope and developed enhanced versions of our model, now featuring 111 million and 650 million parameters, respectively. This represents a substantial increase, up to 50 times the parameter count of our initial model.\n\nThe effectiveness of these larger models is evident in the revised Tables 1, 2 and Supp. Table 17, as well as in Figure 4 of our manuscript, which collectively demonstrate a significant boost in performance attributable to the increased parameter count. However, we were not able to finish training the 650M parameter model in Table 1 due to time constraints. In a future version of the manuscript, this model will be included.\n\nIn line with our commitment to collaborative research and open science, we plan to make all variants of these models accessible to the broader research community. By sharing these models, we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in the field, inviting other researchers to build upon, refine, or even challenge our findings.\n\nQ: Comparison to baselines.\n\nR: We acknowledge the reviewer's concern regarding the challenge of evaluating results in clinical variable prediction. We conducted a thorough literature review and found that the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) trained on correlation matrices remains the predominant approach in the field (see references [1-3]). This prevalence influenced our decision to include these methods in our study.\n\nMoreover, the absence of more recent methodologies in existing literature led us to develop our own baseline models for comparison. We ensured fairness in evaluation by allocating an equal amount of hyperparameter optimization effort to all models presented in our study.\n\nWe are open to suggestions from the reviewer regarding the inclusion of additional methods. If there are specific, newer approaches that the reviewer believes would enrich our comparative analysis, we are more than willing to incorporate these into our study. Our commitment is to provide a comprehensive and robust benchmarking that reflects the current state of the art in the field.\n\n[1] Woo, Choong-Wan, Luke J. Chang, Martin A. Lindquist, and Tor D.

Please add the non-pretrained BrainLM results or correct the text. In addition, the text could make a clearer mapping from legend to citations (e.g. \"NODE (Chen et al.), LatentODE (Rubanova rt al.)\"). Finally, I am surprised that there is an unpretrained BrainLM baseline in table 4 but not table 3.\u201d\n\nR: We thank the reviewer for pointing out the inconsistency between the legend and the text. We have addressed the issue. We have also added the citations to the methods used in the table. Regarding the absence of a non-pretrained BrainLM model, due to the time constraints associated with this deadline, our efforts were primarily concentrated on experiments pertaining to model scaling. Consequently, we were unable to train the BrainLM 13M model from scratch for clinical variable regression within the stipulated time frame. However, we recognize the importance of this aspect and plan to include it in a future iteration of the manuscript. This addition will undoubtedly provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities and limitations."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their positive comments. We provide detailed responses below.\n\nQ: \u201cLack of novelty, the MAE-like pretrain model and method used in this paper are reasonable, but they are known in the field.\u201d\n\nR: We acknowledge the reviewer's observation that MAE-like pretraining is recognized in the field and well-established in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing. However, the use of such architecture for modeling neural dynamics in whole-brain fMRI data is an area yet to be fully explored. Previous studies predominantly focused on voxel-based recordings and specific brain areas. The voxel-based approach has inherent limitations, such as restricted spatial coverage due to the large number of voxels per area. Our study diverges from this tradition by applying the MAE framework to parcelated fMRI data, an approach not previously undertaken. Our work marks the first attempt to leverage parcel-based dynamics to model the whole brain.\n\nMoreover, our novelty extends to the comprehension of the model. By evaluating its proficiency in predicting functional regions and demonstrating a correlation between brain-wide attention and relevant clinical variables, we underscore the practical utility of these foundational models in the context of fMRI recordings.\n\nIn summary, while MAEs have been explored before in other contexts, their application to extensive fMRI data at this extreme scale, coupled with the sophisticated data engineering involved and the myriad of fine-tuning applications demonstrated, marks a significant departure from existing methodologies. We believe this work firmly establishes the potential of foundation models as a paradigm shift for brain imaging analysis.\n\nQ: \u201cLack of comparative baselines: The baselines used for both clinical variable prediction and brain state prediction are somewhat limited. Baselines such as SVM are outdated.The unsupervised MAE-like model mentioned in the related work should also be considered for comparison.\u201d\n\nR: Regarding the comparison to previous work, the reviewer rightfully points out that SVM and MLP may be considered somewhat outdated. However, such approaches remain widely employed within the neuroscience community for assessing brain function and characterizing disorders [1-3]. Given the limited exploration of machine learning models for predicting clinical variables, we intentionally included these methods in our study. Despite conducting an extensive literature review, no additional relevant approaches were identified. We are receptive to incorporating any additional methods suggested by the reviewer.\n\nFurthermore, the reviewer references other fMRI MAE models mentioned in the related work section, which specifically focus on the visual cortex for decoding stimuli presented to subjects. We believe these models are too domain-specific for our current setting. Nevertheless, we are open to the idea of training our own versions of these models using visual-only information to provide a comparative analysis, if the reviewer deems this necessary.\n\n[1] Woo, Choong-Wan, Luke J.

Our choice of random masking is informed by prior research in the literature, where it has proven to be an effective method for pretraining MAE-like models [1]. However, we acknowledge that alternative masking techniques, such as parcel-level masking, could be a suitable alternative, potentially comparable to higher masking ratios like 80% or 90%, given the extensive number of brain parcels. In fact, we have previously experimented with parcel (spatial) masking but did not observe an improvement and as such we did not further explore this direction. We are interested in exploring this, and other, masking techniques in future work.\n\n[1] Feichtenhofer, Christoph, Yanghao Li, and Kaiming He. \"Masked autoencoders as spatiotemporal learners.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 35 (2022): 35946-35958.\n\nQ: What is the computational cost of the pretraining?\n\nCurrently, any given model can be pretrained on the UKBioBank data in around 6 days on an A100 GPU."
