                    "value": "The paper proposes an approach (GraphPulse) for learning on Discrete Time Dynamic Graphs (DTDGs). GraphPulse relies on the mapper method (a Topological Data Analysis technique used to compress high dimensional data in a small and comprehensible graphical representation) to extract latent topological properties of each graph snapshot. More in detail, provided a sequence of graphs (G_1, G_2, \u2026, G_N), for each graph G_i, the authors extract a finite set of \u201csnapshot\u201d features describing the general properties of G_i (i.e. the\nnumber of nodes, the number of edges, and the average value of edge weights). They then proceed at computing for G_i a compact graphical representation using the mapper method, and from the obtained graph they extract 5 new \u201cmapper\u201d features (the number of nodes, the number of edges, the maximum cluster size, the average cluster size, and the average value of edge weights). The snapshot and mapper features of each graph are then fed in input to a sequential model (LSTM+GRU), which outputs a prediction for the sequence of graphs. To evaluate their method, the authors defined a network growth problem where they aim at predicting whether a given network in a future interval will show more edges than in the past or not."

                    "value": "While I found the manuscript rather interesting and generally well presented, in some parts I had some difficulties completely understanding the paper. For instance, in Section 3, the clustering method is not really introduced in the mapper method and I found it difficult at first to understand the role that this would have in the overall approach. Similarly, in the experimental section I did not find details on what clustering algorithm or lens function the authors used for computing the Mapper Network (edge weights for the mapper network and mapper hyperparameters in Section 6 are also not defined in the paper). I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could provide some details in their rebuttal on this to clarify my understanding of their paper (and in general improve readability).\n\nFor what concerns the experimental evaluation, the results look promising, however I wonder if using a GIN as a static GNN baseline might not be fair. The goal of the model is to predict whether in a future window of time there will be more edges in the graph than in the past. As such, being able to understand whether the network is growing in size (or not) over time seems a priori a meaningful feature for the model. This information can however not be captured with a GIN, as the only features this has access to are: Outgoing EdgeWeight Sum, Incoming EdgeWeight Sum, Outgoing Edge Count, and Incoming Edge Count; which do not describe such evolution. For this reason I wonder if decorating edge features with the timestamp associated to the time when an edge appears and using an architecture able to compute graph embeddings based on edge features (e.g. a MPNN) could be a better baseline for the given prediction task."

                    "value": "I found it interesting that the authors handcrafted a feature descriptor for both a snapshot and the mapper network. While reading the paper I was expecting to see a GNN for extrapolating graph-wise features that would have then been used in input to the recurrent model. This would have provided (ignoring the construction of the mapper network with a fixed lens function) an end-to-end learnable approach that would have indeed suited a generic classification problem. I wonder if the authors have experimented with such a solution in their experiments and whether this could provide a further boost in performance."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their time and valuable feedback.\n\n**W1 I would greatly appreciate it if the authors could provide some details in their rebuttal on this to clarify my understanding of their paper (and in general improve readability)**\n\n**A:**  Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have addressed your comments by adding parameter definitions to the Appendix A.4. We added further clarification for our lens and clustering methods in Section 6 of the main paper. Moreover we included a definition for edge weight in TDA graphs in Appendix A. Your feedback helped us further improve the clarity of our paper.  We will also address your comments below.\nFor the lens function, we are using a 2D-TSNE and for the clustering algorithm, we used the KMeans algorithm for clustering the points inside each cubes. Also regarding the hyperparameters definition of the TDA mapper, our mapper includes three hyperparameters:\n\n* **Number of Cubes (n_cubes):** Number of hypercubes along each dimension of the projected point cloud using the lens function.\n\n* **Percentage of Overlaps (perc_overlap):** Percentage of overlap between adjacent cubes calculated along each dimension.\n\n* **Number of Clusters (cls)**: Number of clusters in the K-means algorithm that determines the number of inner clusters formed within each cube.\n\nFinally, In TDA Mapper graphs, nodes are associated with clusters of data points, and edges are drawn between nodes based on the overlap or commonality of data points between the clusters. The edge weight reflects the strength of this connection, indicating how many data points are included in the overlapped area.\n\n**W2  I wonder if decorating edge features with the timestamp associated to the time when an edge appears and using an architecture able to compute graph embeddings based on edge features (e.g. a MPNN) could be a better baseline for the given prediction task**\n\n**A:** Thank you for the review. In fact, static baselines are a good first check on what graph neural networks can achieve but we do not expect them to yield SOTA results in temporal graph tasks. For this reason, we employ three well-known SOTA methods in our experiments and show that GraphPulse outperforms all of them. \nIn response to your suggestion, we conducted a new experiment for the time stamped Adex dataset. We introduced the time (day) of edge appearance as an additional edge feature in our GIN model. Indeed, as you suggested, these modifications led to notable improvements in the static GIN results. Overall, we still observe that our GraphPulse method and other temporal baselines outperforms static GIN as expected.\n\n| Model                   | Result  |\n|-------------------------|---------|\n| Static GIN                               | 0.44842 |\n| GIN with Temp. Edge Feat           | 0.61304 |\n| HTGN                    | 0.73308 |\n| GRUGCN                  | 0.6843  |\n| EGCN                    | 0.71678 |\n| GraphPulse (Ours)              | 0.8928  |\n\n**Q1 I wonder if the authors have experimented with such a solution in their experiments and whether this could provide a further boost in performance**\n\n**A:** Thank you for your suggestion. Indeed, designing an end-to-end learnable approach is an interesting idea and your suggestion is employed by the EvolveGCN method, which is a baseline compared in our experiments.  The input to EvolveGCN is a sequence of graph snapshots and it captures the network's dynamic by using an RNN to update the GCN parameters over time. Here, for each timestamp, all the node embeddings are aggregated (via mean pooling) to generate a graph-level embedding and then EvolveGCN is adapted to train end-to-end for the temporal graph property prediction task. Empirically, we show that our GraphPulse method consistently outperforms EvolveGCN. We plan to explore the possibility of applying Mapper directly to the graph without relying on node features as a future direction for an end-to-end approach based on GraphPulse."

With the new static baseline you added the day of appearance as an edge feature in GIN. However, the GIN model as defined in the original paper doesn't include the use of edge features in the definition of the convolutional layer. How have those edge features been used in the model? did you simply combine them to the original node features of the neighbours and added zero padding to the target node or you used an additional MLP on the neighbors features (before summation) for dimensionality reduction? I would be personally in favour of the latter to enrich the quality of the representation and provide the fairest comparison (the former approach would not necessarily produce an injective function over the neighbourhood, which in turn would not necessarily produce a maximally expressive GNN). Also I think that the analysis should be run with all the datasets of Table 1, not just Adex."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their time and valuable feedback.\n\n**W1 It is unclear how hyperparameters sensitive the model is.**\n\n**A:** Thanks for raising this point. Due to the page limit for the main text, a comprehensive hyperparameter sensitivity analysis was included in Appendix A.4. The key finding from this analysis is that within a well-defined and extensive region within the hyperparameter space,  GraphPulse consistently achieves the best performances, with an AUC exceeding 0.7 as illustrated in Figure 10.\n\n**W2 Since GraphPulse is a generic framework applicable to extend the embedding algorithms to embed a temporal graph, the generalizability of GraphPulse should be discussed and tested**\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for raising this question. We believe that the topological information extracted from Mapper is a key component to GraphPulse as seen in experiments (Section 6) and using Mapper in GraphPulse is an important architectural choice. In terms of generalizability, GraphPulse can generalize to multiple graph properties such as growth, density, node count, and more, and achieve SOTA performance on all of them. We also tested GraphPulse extensively on nine networks from two distinct domains and GraphPulse is able to generalize to all of them with strong performance on each. Indeed as the reviewer suggested, GraphPulse is a generic framework that could incorporate other embedding algorithms and future work can utilize additional embedding algorithms.\n\n**W3 There are some typos. For example, in page 18, there are two different \u201cneighborhood\u201d styles of writing**\n\n**A:** Thank you for the review. We will consolidate our writing and remove one of the conflicting styles. We have fixed the neighborhood issue in the paper.\n\n**Q1 Is the GraphPulse applicable in link prediction, edge sign prediction in signed networks, edge/node attribute prediction? Compared to the embedding algorithms that are customized for those particular graph mining applications, what are the advantage of the proposed GraphPulse?**\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for discussing this point. We design the GraphPulse framework to generate graph level embeddings for the temporal graph property prediction task. Edge level tasks such as link prediction and edge sign prediction are not directly applicable for GraphPulse. However, the topological features captured by TDA also provide node embeddings which can be beneficial to node and edge level tasks. \n\nThe real advantage of GraphPulse is that it represents graphs in a Newtonian phase space, as illustrated in Figure 8. By constructing the phase space, we can treat the graphs as if they were particles in a dynamic system. This enables us to predict the trajectory of the graph, i.e., where the graph will be at the next time step, based on its current state. Based on the trajectory, we can predict new nodes (in Figure 2a, the first two graphs where a node is added), we can predict motifs (Figure 2a, the third graph is developing triangles and can be expected to get denser), we can identify node features (Figure 2a, leaf nodes co-appearing in the mapper cluster having similar features). GraphPulse allows for customized applications due to the fact that the mapper tool is highly customizable, and once the mapper network is created, we can represent graphs, node subsets or edge subsets in a phase space to be used by GraphPulse."

                        "value": "I would like to thank the authors for their detailed responses. I appreciate that representing the graphs in the Newtonian phase space and treating their evolutions as the trajectory path in the space is promising and novel. The authors also indicate a very important point that the mapper tool is highly customizable for representing graphs and node/edge subsets. I am wondering how to customize the GraphPulse so that it can be well applied to node/edge subsets or widely graph mining applications. It is worth discussing in the paper so that the followers can have a better judgment about whether they should directly use GraphPulse or develop a customized model when building their own solutions to solve similar problems in the future.\n\nAs reviewer NvJb mentioned, Mapper cannot well capture the connection information. Although GraphPulse can effectively capture a global view of graph evolution based on simple node statistics and node features, which shows good results in the experiments, I believe Mapper is not the only model that can achieve this goal as GraphPulse is a general framework. Could you please discuss why Mapper is the best choice for GraphPulse? Doesn't changing Mapper to something incorporating the connection information get better performance?"

However, there is a notable absence of retained graph structure information when compared to the original graph structure. In my opinion, the overall structure and the connections between nodes are more crucial and directly effective in the process of learning dynamic graphs. I would suggest the authors to incorporate the connection information into the model.\n\nW2. The current assessment of the graph property focuses on determining whether there is a rise or decline in the number of edges, resulting in a fairly limited perspective. I would suggest the authors utilize more comprehensive graph properties to evaluate model capabilities on temporal graphs, such as changing node counts, density, diameter, degree distribution, and the number of triangles. Additionally, rather than binary classification, predicting the specific number of increased/decreased edges would test a finer-grained understanding of edge dynamics."

In this work, we focus on the graph property prediction task which requires a global understanding of the graph structure. Empirically, we find that the combination of Mapper representation and aggregated node features outperforms SOTA temporal GNNs based on local message passing. This might be because GraphPulse can effectively capture a global view of graph evolution based on simple node statistics and node features. In the literature, it is known that classical message passing based GNNs can suffer from various issues such as limited expressiveness (up to 1-WL test), over-squashing, and over-smoothing. How to best capture the global graph structure for GNNs remains one of the open research directions. Thus in this work, our proposed GraphPulse acts as a first approach for temporal graph property prediction and we leave it to future work to further improve upon GraphPulse by further encoding the global graph structure.\n\n**W2 Utilize more comprehensive graph properties to evaluate model capabilities on temporal graphs, such as changing node counts, density, diameter, degree distribution, and the number of triangles**\n\n**A:** We express our gratitude to the reviewer for bringing up this point. In this work, as a first approach, we formulate the temporal graph property prediction task as a binary classification task indicating the increase/decrease of graph properties in the future. This formulation can directly be applied to important applications such as deciding if the number of transactions in a cryptocurrency network will grow in the future or if the number of users will increase in a social network. As the reviewer pointed out, the next step would be to predict the extent of growth and decrease as a regression task which is left as an important future work due to the fact that regression tasks are much less studied in graph representation learning literature in general as compared to classification tasks and they pose additional challenges; for example, the magnitude of different properties can vary significantly over time. \n\nWe also thank the reviewer for suggesting additional graph properties for evaluation. In this rebuttal, we have experimented with two additional properties, namely density and node counts (as kindly suggested by the reviewer). The detailed results are reported in Table 10 and Table 11 in Appendix D and we observe that GraphPulse performs the best overall. This suggests that the GraphPulse framework can generalize to a variety of graph properties."

The paper presents a process that takes snapshots of temporal graphs at fixed intervals, constructs TDA Mapper representations for these snapshots, and then uses these topological features along with snapshot graph features for sequential modeling to predict future graph properties. The paper claims superior performance over existing models in predicting network growth on several datasets, including new cryptocurrency network datasets."

                        "value": "We thank the reviewer for their time and valuable feedback.\n\n**W1 Focusing solely on the growth rate as a graph property is a limitation** \n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for raising this point. Indeed exploring additional graph properties is an important direction. In this revision, we have added two additional properties: graph density and node counts growth in Appendix D, Table 10 and Table 11. We observe that GraphPulse significantly outperforms all baselines, which shows it is generalizable across multiple graph properties. \n\n**W2 The omission of key recent models like PINT[1] and ROLAND[2] from the baseline comparisons**\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for pointing out these references. The PINT model is designed for continuous time dynamic graphs (CTDGs), a different setting than our discrete time dynamic graph (DTDG) setting and it is non-trivial to extract graph level embedding for CTDG methods as the node embeddings are updated based on each edges (rather than each graph snapshot).\nROLAND is a notable work in bringing static GNNs to a dynamic setting (as opposed to a specific new model). While ROLAND is a great framework for dynamic graphs, it is not trivial to compare its problem setting with our considered setting as explained below.\n\nIn the live-update setting of the ROLAND, the prediction labels at timestamp $t-1$ (i.e., $y_{t-1}$) are first split into $y_{t-1}^{train}$ and $y_{t-1}^{val}$, where the $y_{t-1}^{train}$ is used for fine-tuning the model and $y_{t-1}^{val}$ is used for validation evaluation. Then, at time $t+1$ where the $y_t$ are observed, the performance of the model is tested. This process is repeated for each time interval, and the average performance over all graph snapshots is reported.\n\nIt should be noted that the aforementioned evaluation procedure of ROLAND is different from our considered setting which is in line with the standard fixed split evaluation (adopted in previous works such as EvolveGCN and HTGN). In our evaluation, we construct the training, validation, and test sets by chronologically splitting the available graph snapshot sequence. We evaluate the trained model for every snapshot of the test set, however, the model is not updated based on the test observations.\n\n**W3 The introduction of the Newtonian phase space model is an interesting conceptual proposition but remains unexploited in the actual modeling and theoretical justification**\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. By formulating the temporal graph learning problem through the lens of Newtonian space, we establish a discrete dynamical system. This framework allows us to assess our methodology using TDA Mapper through extensive experiments as detailed in Appendix A. It is important to note that a comprehensive theoretical justification for motion in a phase space, even in its simplest form, requires formulating equations for a discrete dynamical system derived from the specific context. In our approach, we opted for a more pragmatic strategy, validating our model within a known phase space and demonstrating its utility across various settings.\n\nGraphPulse undertook the crucial step of ensuring the construction of a valid and valuable phase space. We achieve this validation by using the visually explainable tool; i.e., TDA Mapper (refer to Figure 2). Building on this, the graphs can be directly put into a phase space where their trajectories can be studied. In Figure 8 of the Appendix, we show such a trajectory. \n\n**Q1 How does the algorithm perform on other prediction task in addition to the growth rate prediction?**\n\n**A:** We thank the reviewer for the reference (added to the Related Work Section) and for proposing the additional measures that are definitely interesting to explore. As mentioned above, in this rebuttal, we showed that GraphPulse is able to generalize to graph properties including density and node count. Due to the time limit of the rebuttal phase, we are considering adding other properties later in the future. \n\n**Q2 What role does the Newtonian dynamics play in the proposed algorithm?**\n\n**A:** The core idea for our temporal framework is inspired by Newton\u2019s laws of motion and we formulate temporal graph property prediction as predicting the trajectory of a motion in a phase space. First, a novel perspective is presented by connecting temporal graph property prediction with discrete dynamical systems, a well-established mathematical field. Second, such a connection allows us to test the hypothesis that our TDA Mapper approach aids in predicting graph trajectories. To validate this, we conducted extensive experiments in various phase spaces with different settings, as detailed in Appendix A. These experiments not only support our intuition but also explain the significance of TDA Mapper in extracting complex feature information from token networks, contributing to trajectory prediction."
