What are the metrics to select and finalize the eight datasets?\n   \nThe most important metric is quality. We started with a much larger pool of existing datasets and have made significant efforts to validate those datasets. However, many of the datasets in the pool are low-quality; including those low-quality datasets would waste the time of other researchers and practitioners in the community. Thus, we only included the high-quality ones. Other metrics we used to select and finalize the datasets include types of IoT devices, sensor modalities, applications, and size of the datasets. As shown in `Table 1` in the paper and noted in `Section 3.1`, we included datasets that cover a wide range of IoT devices, sensor modalities, and applications. Moreover, our selected datasets have very diverse sizes (small, medium, large). The rationale behind this design choice is to accommodate researchers who have different computing resources. For example, researchers who have very limited computing resources can still pick the relatively small datasets included in our benchmark to develop and evaluate their algorithms.\n \n&nbsp;"

The framework aims to address the unique challenges posed by IoT ecosystems, such as data privacy, limited computational resources, and network constraints.\n\nKey Contributions\nNovel Framework: The paper presents the architecture and design principles of FedAIoT, which incorporates distributed data storage and decentralized learning algorithms to enable IoT devices to participate in machine learning tasks without compromising data privacy.\n\nMathematical Formulation: The authors provide rigorous mathematical models to describe the federated learning process, focusing on optimization algorithms and convergence properties.\n\nExperimental Validation: Through extensive experiments using real-world and synthetic datasets, the authors demonstrate that FedAIoT outperforms traditional centralized learning methods in terms of accuracy, privacy preservation, and computational efficiency.\n\nApplicability: The framework is designed to be adaptable to various IoT applications, from smart homes to industrial automation.\n\nMethodology\nThe paper employs a federated learning approach where IoT devices can train machine learning models locally on their own data and then share only the model parameters with a central server for global aggregation.

                    "value": "Abstract and Introduction\nThe paper proposes a unified end-to-end Federated Learning (FL) framework for Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) named FedAIoT. The framework is benchmarked across multiple IoT datasets and incorporates a variety of data partitioning schemes, preprocessing techniques, models, and FL hyperparameters. Despite its comprehensive approach, the paper lacks a comparative study with existing state-of-the-art solutions. Moreover, while the paper mentions the inclusion of popular schemes and models in its framework, it doesn't substantiate why these were chosen over other potential candidates.\n\nEquations and Mathematical Formulations\nThe paper briefly touches upon the Dirichlet distribution for creating non-IID data partitions and mentions metrics like accuracy and Mean Average Precision (MAP-50). However, it lacks mathematical rigor. For instance, the Dirichlet distribution is mentioned but not defined. A formal definition, perhaps along with its probability density function, would have given more depth. Furthermore, there are no equations to represent the FL optimizers like FedAvg and FedOPT, which makes it difficult to appreciate the nuances or compare them.\n\nTables and Figures\nTable 1: While useful for a cursory comparison, this table lacks depth. For example, it could include a comparison based on performance metrics to provide an analytical foundation for its claims.\n\nFigure 1 and 2: These figures provide an overview but lack detail. For example, Figure 2 could be improved by including the types of IoT-specific preprocessing techniques or by detailing the architecture of the proposed IoT-friendly models.\n\nTable 4: This table summarizes the performance metrics but lacks confidence intervals or p-values, which are essential for ascertaining the statistical significance of the results.\n\nTable 5: While this table attempts to show the impact of client sampling ratios, it doesn't explain why only two ratios (10% and 30%) were chosen for comparison.\n\nDataset and Experimental Design\nThe paper includes a wide range of datasets, which is commendable. However, it doesn't provide any rationale for the specific choice of datasets. Furthermore, no information is given about the train-test split methodology. Was it random or stratified? The partitioning schemes for these datasets are discussed, but there is a lack of empirical justification for why these schemes are effective or superior to existing methods.\n\nAlgorithms and Techniques\nThe paper discusses various FL optimizers, data partitioning schemes, and IoT-friendly models, but there is a lack of justification for the chosen methods. For example, why were FedAvg and FedOPT selected as FL optimizers? Are they computationally less expensive or do they converge faster?\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe paper presents a broad range of results but lacks a discussion comparing these results to existing benchmarks or state-of-the-art methods. The paper would benefit from including such a comparative analysis.\n\nInsufficient Empirical Validation\nThe experiments conducted are somewhat limited in scope and scale. Only a few datasets are considered, and they seem to belong to similar domains. This raises questions about the model's generalizability. Moreover, the paper lacks ablation studies, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each component of the proposed method.\n\nActionable Insight: Include a broader array of datasets from varying domains to validate the model. Conduct ablation studies to quantify the impact of each component or parameter.\n\nAbsence of Comparative Analysis\nWhile the paper aims to introduce a novel methodology, there is an absence of a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Without this, the paper falls short of convincingly establishing the proposed method's superiority or novelty.\n\nActionable Insight: Include comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative terms. This could be in the form of performance metrics, computational efficiency, or even qualitative assessments based on real-world applicability.\n\nMathematical Rigor\nThe paper would significantly benefit from a more rigorous mathematical treatment of the proposed algorithm. Currently, it seems to rely more on empirical observations. Given your stated goals of developing proper mathematical models, this is an area that requires attention.\n\nActionable Insight: Introduce formal proofs or derivations that can substantiate the algorithm's properties, such as stability, convergence, or robustness. Include theoretical justifications for the choices made in the algorithm's design.\n\nLack of Discussion on Limitations\nEvery model has its limitations, and acknowledging them not only adds credibility but also helps in guiding future work.\n\nActionable Insight: Devote a section to discuss the limitations of the proposed method and potential avenues for future research."

How do these assumptions align with the real-world scenarios where the model is expected to be deployed?\n\nMethodological Choices: What was the rationale behind the selection of specific hyperparameters and architectural elements in the proposed model? Some clarification on this could strengthen the paper's methodological grounding.\n\nEvaluation Metrics: The paper uses a particular set of metrics for evaluation. Could the authors elucidate why these metrics are most suitable for assessing the model's performance? Are there any other metrics that were considered but not used?\n\nComputational Complexity: How does the computational complexity of the proposed method compare with existing state-of-the-art methods? Could the authors provide a detailed analysis in this regard?\n\nScalability: The paper does not discuss how well the proposed method scales with the size of the dataset. Could the authors provide insights or supplementary experiments that address this?\n\nAblation Study: The absence of an ablation study leaves some questions about the necessity of each component of the proposed model. Could the authors provide such an analysis in the rebuttal or an extended version of the paper?\n\nTheoretical Guarantees: Are there any theoretical guarantees, such as convergence or bounds, that can be associated with the proposed algorithm? If yes, this would be a valuable addition to the paper.\n\nLimitations: Every model has its shortcomings.

It isn't clear whether this is competing work, or work by the authors of the submitted paper. In either case, it seems highly relevant but does not appear to be cited. One way to deal with this problem within the blind review process is to cite the work, but use an entry such as \"Redacted for blind review\" in the bibliography during the review process. Another paper, \"FedML: A Research Library and Benchmark for Federated Machine Learning\" claims to support IoT devices. I am not claiming that those papers are identical to this work, but they seem close enough to merit contrasting them with the author's benchmark. I view this as a substantial weakness, but one that might be resolved via rebuttals and simple revision.\n\n+ The modifications to the curated datasets are not well justified.

If so, does that mean that centralized training and evaluation must be redone to enable noisy labeling whenever an algorithm changes? Or is there something fundamental about the confusion matrix, i.e., is it unlikely to change much when models change?\n\n 2) Why not leave the sounds in raw format instead of converting to the frequency domain with particular parameters? Isn't this sort of raw data to feature conversion part of the approaches your benchmarks will be used to evaluate? If so, why build one particular approach to feature extraction into the benchmarks?\n\n3) What is the purpose of Section 4? To demonstrate that the benchmarks can be used to compare optimizers? Enabling comparison doesn't imply enabling comparison yielding correct ranking of optimizers. If you could demonstrate that the findings using your benchmarks differ from those using the most closely related existing (perhaps even non-IoT) benchmarks, and your benchmarks are more typical of applications in the IoT domain, that would support your claim that your benchmarks are more useful in this domain than prior work."

                        "value": "> The authors claim this is the first IoT FL benchmark but a Google Scholar search turns up \"FLBench: A Benchmark Suite for Federated Learning\" by Yuan Liang, Yange Guo, Yanxia Gong, Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan, and Yunyou Huang, which includes an AIoT benchmark domain. It isn't clear whether this is competing work, or work by the authors of the submitted paper. In either case, it seems highly relevant but does not appear to be cited. \n\nThank you for pointing this out. There are two key differences between FLBench and FedML and our proposed FedAIoT. First, FLBench and FedML are framework papers. Although they claimed that they support IoT data, none of them provide benchmark results on real IoT datasets. In contrast, our proposed FedAIoT includes eight well-selected high-quality datasets and provides benchmark results and analysis on those eight IoT datasets. Second, compared to the frameworks proposed in FLBench and FedML, the framework proposed in FedAIoT is specifically designed for IoT: it includes several modules such as IoT-specific data preprocessing, IoT-friendly models, and IoT-factor emulator. All of these modules are not included in FLBench and FedML. We realize that we did not make it clear in our submission. We will cite both FLBench and FedML and clarify the differences in our revised version."

In theory, the confusion matrix used for noisy labeling depends on the particular centralized learning approach. However, the changes between different models are minimal."

                        "value": ">  Although the paper does well in introducing a new benchmarking framework for FL for IoT, it still largely builds upon curating from existing datasets introduced by prior works.\n\nWe want to first clarify that we took serious consideration on the choice between collecting our own datasets and selecting existing ones. Our goal is to provide a benchmark that consists of many high-quality and well-validated datasets collected across a wide range of IoT devices, sensor modalities, and applications. We find that collecting datasets by ourselves is not an efficient way to achieve this goal. In contrast, there is a plethora of publicly available datasets that were already collected by different groups in the research community. Including an existing dataset that has been validated and widely used by the community is more trustworthy than a self-collected dataset that has not been validated by the community. The trustworthiness of a dataset is particularly important for benchmarking purposes. Therefore, we decided to build our benchmark based on the existing datasets.\n\n  \n\nWe want to further emphasize that our choice of selecting existing datasets is not an easy task. This is because many existing datasets are not high-quality to be included as benchmarking datasets. In fact, we made significant efforts and invested time to validate a much larger pool of existing datasets and identified the high-quality ones to include in our benchmark.\n\n  \n\nWe would also like to note that, to the best of our knowledge, all of the existing FL benchmarks (e.g., Flamby [1], FedCV [2], Flute [3], FedNLP [4], FedAudio [5], FedMultimodal [6]) use existing datasets that are well-validated and widely used by the community for their specific domains (e.g., medical, computer vision, natural language, audio, multimodal, etc.) other than collecting new datasets.\n\n[1] Ogier du Terrail, Jean, et al. \"FLamby: Datasets and Benchmarks for Cross-Silo Federated Learning in Realistic Healthcare Settings.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 5315-5334.\n\n[2] He, Chaoyang, et al. \"FedCV: a federated learning framework for diverse computer vision tasks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.11066 (2021).\n\n[3] Hipolito Garcia, Mirian, et al. \"Flute: A scalable, extensible framework for high-performance federated learning simulations.\" arXiv e-prints (2022): arXiv-2203.\n\n[4] Lee, Jean, et al. \"Fednlp: an interpretable nlp system to decode federal reserve communications.\" Proceedings of the 44th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval. 2021.\n\n[5] Zhang, Tuo, et al. \"Fedaudio: A federated learning benchmark for audio tasks.\" IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP). 2023.\n\n[6] Feng, Tiantian, et al. \"FedMultimodal: A Benchmark For Multimodal Federated Learning.\" ACM KDD (2023)."

Different from works that focus on proposing new techniques, we followed works that focus on federated learning benchmarks published at top-tier venues [1-5] to frame our contributions. Therefore, we believe that a comparison of our work with other federated learning benchmark studies would be a fair approach.\n    \n\nSpecifically, compared to other FL benchmark studies referenced previously [1-5], our work has three key novel contributions:\n\n1.  Our benchmark represents the first FL benchmark that focuses on data collected from IoT devices. We have put in a lot of work to explore, validate, and include unique IoT-specific data modalities that previous benchmarks do not include.\n    \n2.  Some IoT data modalities such as wireless signals are unique. For non-IID data partitioning and normalization, we include new techniques that are designed for those unique IoT data modalities that other benchmarks do not include.\n    \n3.  The proposed noisy labels (non-uniform addition of noise) and quantized training at the client side, though seemingly incremental, are really important to IoT data. To be honest, we have been striving to make meaningful and useful contributions instead of making our approach look fancy. We believe these proposed techniques can make meaningful contributions to our community. We realize that we did not make it clear in our submission, and we will make this point clear in our revised version."
