Since FedMD-CG does not communicate the local feature extractors to the server, it provides high-level of protection for clients under gradient inversion attack. Extensive experimental results validate the effect of  FedMD-CG in accuracy and privacy."

                        "value": "We highly appreciate Reviewer eFsa for providing thoughtful feedback on our work. We respond to specific comments below.\n\nQ1: For the classification task (which the paper is mainly focusing on), the proposed method requires clients not only to train a model for classification (feature extractor and classifier) as well as a local generator. For the server, it needs to train a global generator. This introduces much more computation overhead. On-edge learning where all clients have limited resources, the propose method might not work. For data-free KD-based FL, there is a prior work that does not need to train a generative model. I think it's better to compare with it [1].\n\nR1: We agree with the reviewer that the proposed method may not work in edge learning where all clients have limited resources.\nAs discussed in Appendix F Limitations of our submitted paper, it is extremely challenging to try to develop a universal FL method that can address all problems.\nIn our work, we focus on model decoupling (MD)-based FL [2, 3, 4, 5], which has been widely acknowledged to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage of standard FL in the community.  In particular,  our main contribution is to achieve better generalization performance given the same level of privacy protection as FedCG. Additionally, our method significantly outperforms the MD-based baselines in most cases (see Table 1).\n\nIn addition, we thank the reviewers for mentioning existing work [1]. We have already studied [1] during our preparation of the manuscript. This work focuses on each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that it refers to as \u201chyper-knowledge\u201d.\nThe server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training.\nAlso, it promotes privacy with the help of the differential privacy mechanism.\nThis can be clearly seen to be orthogonal to our work.\nTherefore, to ensure fair comparisons, we neglect the comparison with the method proposed by [1].\nBesides, we'll add the mentioned paper as one of our references.\n\n\nQ2: The local objective and server's objective functions are so complicated. There are many terms using MSE, KLD and Cross-Entropy Loss. As a result, there are too many hyper-parameters for the regularization terms. However, there is no theoretical analysis on the convergence in the paper. The method is empirical but difficult to reproduce because so many hyper-parameters.\n\nR2: Our approach closely follows the FedCG framework [2]. We propose several incremental innovations to improve upon the FedCG framework.  \nAlthough the proposed changes appear to be complicated, they are simply based on knowledge distillation concepts and most of them are intuitively reasonable.\n\nIn addition, we argue that the theoretical guarantee (including privacy protection and convergence) for our method is crucial. \nHowever, it\u2019s worth noting that even in well-known MD-based federated learning efforts [2, 3, 4, 5], as well as federated learning methods with the help of the generator [2, 3, 6, 7], comprehensive theoretical analysis concerning the privacy guarantees and convergency is often absent. This is also discussed in Appendix 7 Limitations of our submitted paper.\nGiven the lack of suitable theoretical frameworks, we concentrated on robust empirical validation, showcasing our method (FedMD-CG). \nOur results, we believe, robustly demonstrate our method\u2019s utility. We intend to delve deeper into theoretical aspects in future work.\n\nMoreover, the empirical results in our paper can all be reproduced by the code we provide.\n\n\nQ3: The experiments ran on simple datasets, EMNIST, FMNIST,CIFAR-10. The proposed method need to be validated in more larger dataset such as CIFAR100/ImageNet. However, more complicated dataset might need more larger model as generators, which increases the computation overhead.\n\nR3: We agree with this point about its application to intricate data and model scenarios. However, all our experiments are conducted on one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32Gb of memory, thus running FedMD-CG and baselines on the intricate data and model would incur extreme time costs. Also, we follow existing work FedCG [2] and FedGen [3] to setup backbone architectures (i.e., LeNet-5) in our work. On this account, we concentrated on robust empirical validation, showcasing our method (FedMD-CG). \n\nQ4: The small problem of the paper: many notations are similar, such as $\\mathcal{L}_{mse}$ with $\\leftarrow$ and $\\rightarrow$, really confusing. And the table 4 in ablation study, those different $\\mathcal{L}$ are not straightforward.\n\nR4: We will take the reviewers' comments into account and will update them in the revised paper.\n\nQ5: what's the insight for the privacy protection? There is no theoretical analysis on the privacy or detailed discussion on why privacy is preserved with the proposed method.\n\nR5: Please see R2 for details."

Yet, the performance of FedMD-CG can't even beat FedCG in some settings.\n\nR9: We acknowledge that in a few cases FedMD-CG does not perform as well as FedCG. e.g., in Table 6 in Appendix E.2, FedCG slightly outperforms FedMD-CG when $\\omega =10.0$ and $\\omega = 1.0$; however, FedMD-CG significantly beats FedCG in most other cases.\nOur work is indeed inspired by FedCG and improved for its shortcomings. \nWe describe this in detail in the third paragraph of Itroduction. \nSpecifically, first, knowledge transfer modality at the latent feature level may not be sufficient. \nSecond, additional discriminators need to be trained to satisfy the adversarial training of cGAN. \nThird, the trained local generator may not match the local classifier, terming their inconsistency.\nThen, experiments were executed specifically to validate it in the Experimental section, see Table 3.\nTherefore, we believe that our effort is meaningful and can advance the field.\n\n\nQ10: The method can be applied in limited range because of tremendous computation overhead, ''requires clients to have more hardware and computational resources to train generators and local models as compared to FedAvg.\" as stated in the paper.\n\nR10: We agree with this statement. \nHowever, our main purpose of using more hardware and computational resources to train the generators is to overcome the drawback that FedAvg is highly vulnerable to inference attacks. \nThis is fully verified in Table 2 and Figure 3 in the Experimental section, indicating that FedAvg fail to cope with gradient attacks.\nThis is also the aim of the baselines FedPer, LG-FedAvg, FedGen and FedCG, which we have explained in detail in R2.\nAs such, the goal of our approach is to guarantee privacy while maximising model performance.\n\nQ11: The experiments are not comprehensive and confusing. The proposed method does not show dominant performance over other baselines. The simulated systems have only 20 clients and can not verify the performance in larger-scale systems.\n\nR11: We argue that we have done comprehensive experiments and provided detailed descriptions to avoid confusion.\nWe acknowledge that our method slightly underperformances some methods (e.g., FedCG) in terms of accuracy in a few cases, which we believe is reasonable. \nThis is because it is unrealistic and challenging to try to develop a FL method that performs optimally in all cases.\nAnd our method is clearly superior to state-of-the-art MD-based methods (e.g., FedPer, LG-FedAvg, FedGen, and FedCG) in most cases, see Table 1 and Tables 6-8 in the Appendix E.2.\nMoreover, in the experimental setup part, e.g., the number of clients, we follow the existing works [2, 3] to ensure a fair comparison.\n\nWe aspire for our response to address the reviewer's concerns. We remain dedicated to addressing concerns you may possess with utmost eagerness."

It achieves this by partitioning a classification network into two components: a feature extractor and a head. To obviate the need of synchronizing feature extractors across different clients, a conditional feature generator is introduced. The proposed framework offers an inherent advantage in privacy protection, as classical gradient inversion attacks become ineffective due to the absence of access to the feature extractor. \n\nThe conditional generator serves two purposes: it guides the training of local heads and also influences the output of local feature extractor. To further enhance local training and global aggregation, the authors incorporate various knowledge distillation technologies."

                        "value": "We highly appreciate Reviewer iK9N for positive comments and precious feedback on our work. We respond to specific comments below.\n\nQ1: Despite the second point mentioned in the Strengthens section, it appears that the proposed framework has a simpler substitute. For example, rather than training an additional feature generator, the clients can share their features and corresponding labels directly. In terms of privacy leakage, this alternative is equivalent to the proposed method, since the feature generator itself is trained on local features. Furthermore, direct feature sharing can largely reduce the framework's complexity.\n\nR1: During the preparation of the manuscript, we noted that there is existing work [1] that makes efforts on alternatives.\nThis work focuses on each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions \u2013- information that it refers to as \u201chyper-knowledge\u201d. \nThe server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training.\nIt has previously been argued that communicating averaged data representation promotes privacy [2]; however, hyper-knowledge exchanged between server and clients may still be exposed to differential attacks [3, 4].\nTherefore, it promotes privacy with the help of the differential privacy mechanism.\n\nWe argue that our approach is superior in terms of privacy leakage although it requires training an additional feature generator.\nSpecifically, sharing the generator does not compromise privacy features of local data from clients, since the generator, which takes (z, y) as input, is intended to approximate the local feature extractor's outputs and avoid direct access to the original data x. Figure 4 in the paper verifies this statement. However, we do not deny the case where an attacker exploits the utility of the generator for inference attacks. \n\nQ2: Since the feature extractor is solely trained on the local device using the local data. The diversity of local data becomes critical for the training of feature extractor. Due to the same reason, I question the method's scalability to larger networks. As it stands, the paper only presents results based on the LeNet architecture.\n\nR2: We agree with this point about its application to intricate model scenarios. However, all our experiments are conducted on one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32Gb of memory, thus running FedMD-CG and baselines on the intricate model would incur extreme time costs. Also, we follow existing work FedCG [2] and FedGen [3] to setup backbone architectures (i.e., LeNet-5) in our work. On this account, we concentrated on robust empirical validation, showcasing our method (FedMD-CG).  Our results, we believe, robustly demonstrate our method\u2019s utility.\n\nQ3: The experimental results reveals that the proposed method underperforms compared to baseline approaches in the majority of evaluated settings.\n\nR3: We agree with the reviewer's comments. We acknowledge that our method underperforms compared to the baseline method FedAvg in the majority of evaluated settings.\nThis is illustrated and discussed in the submitted paper. Please see Section 3.2 (Overview test performance comparison) in the main paper.\n\nIn our work, we focus on model decoupling (MD)-based FL [5, 6, 7, 8], which has been widely acknowledged to mitigate the risk of privacy leakage of standard FL in the community. ln particular, our main contribution is to achieve better generalization performance given the same level of privacy protection as FedCG.  Additionally, our method significantly outperforms the MD-based baselines in most cases (see Table 1).\n\nQ4: In Section 2.2, the authors claim \"However, straightforward average aggregation may counteract the local knowledge from clients.\" Could you clarity this statement? Is it based on empirical evidence or theoretical reasoning?\n\nR4: Thanks for the review's keen awareness. The premise scenario for this statement is the data heterogeneity scenario. Specifically, the local models are greatly drifted from each other in data heterogeneity scenario. Thus, traditional gradient (or model) averaging, i.e., straightforward average aggregation, could lose the knowledge in local models, and the performance of the updated global model is much lower than local models. \nThe above statement is already a proven fact from existing works [9, 10, 11].\nWe will revise and update this statement in the revised paper."

                    "value": "1) The foremost goal of the paper is to mitigate privacy leakage through deep gradient leakage (DLG) attacks by a semi-honest server. As noted in the appendix, it is hard to come up with theoretical privacy guarantees for this framework. However, it is certainly feasible to come up with strong attacks and evaluate the proposed algorithm against such strong attacks. While some leakage results are reported in Table 2 and Figure 4, the paper fails to specify the exact attack mechanism deployed. In the proposed framework, the only unknown (compared to the FedAvg setting) for a malicious server are the parameters of the local feature extractors in each round. It should be possible to come up with sophisticated DLG attacks following the same knowledge distillation strategies employed for client training. For instance, can a reverse distillation process be used by the server to transfer knowledge from the local generators to estimate the local feature extractors and then use these local feature extractors to reconstruct the input samples? Can the above attack benefit from the availability of an auxiliary dataset at the server?\n\n2) The evaluation metrics (local and global accuracy) used in this work appear to be unrealistic. The local partition of the test is stochastic and not reproducible. Given that no statistics has been reported, it is hard to judge the variations in performance. On the other hand, the global accuracy also does not make sense because that requires constructing a \"virtual\" model using one round of FedAvg, which is against the main principle of the proposed method. Maybe the local accuracy at each client could be computed based on all the test data and average of these local accuracy values should be reported along with standard deviation.\n\n3) The model used for the experiments is LeNet-5, which is not a reasonable model for most real-world applications. Furthermore, this model has been arbitrarily divided into feature extractor and classifier. The main argument of this work is that the latent feature space has so-called \"high-level patterns\" and it is difficult to construct the input data from these patterns. How accurate is this assumption when the feature extractor is simply a couple of conv layers? Moreover, the datasets used in this experiment are also not representative (very low resolutions images with utmost 10 classes). How will the proposed approach scale for larger resolution images (e.g., 224 x 224) with deeper neural networks (e.g., ResNet-18) and more classes (e.g., ImageNet)?"

                        "value": "We highly appreciate Reviewer i6FV for positive comments and precious feedback on our work. We respond to specific comments below.\n\nQ1:  For instance, can a reverse distillation process be used by the server to transfer knowledge from the local generators to estimate the local feature extractors and then use these local feature extractors to reconstruct the input samples? Can the above attack benefit from the availability of an auxiliary dataset at the server?\n\nR1: We argue that sharing the generator instead of the feature extractor itself does not compromise privacy features of local data from clients, since the generator, which takes (z, y) as input, is intended to approximate the local feature extractor's outputs and avoid direct access to the original data x. Figure 4 in the paper verifies this statement. However, we do not deny the case where an attacker exploits the utility of the generator for inference attacks.\nMoreover, in our empirical experiments, we actually used model inversion to attack the generator. \n\n\nQ2: The evaluation metrics (local and global accuracy) used in this work appear to be unrealistic. The local partition of the test is stochastic and not reproducible. Given that no statistics has been reported, it is hard to judge the variations in performance. On the other hand, the global accuracy also does not make sense because that requires constructing a \"virtual\" model using one round of FedAvg, which is against the main principle of the proposed method. Maybe the local accuracy at each client could be computed based on all the test data and average of these local accuracy values should be reported along with standard deviation.\n\nR2: The L.acc values reported in our paper are similar to the review's suggested strategy, which are to compute local accuracies for each client based on the test data that has been divided equally and to report the mean and standard deviation of these local accuracies.\nIn other words, the distribution of the test data set divided into each client is consistent with that of all test data. \nIn addition, we agree with the review's comments on G.acc. It is true that G.acc cannot be computed in real-world scenarios, but at the same time the local model of each client does not have access to all test data.\nIn our experiments, we construct \"virtual\" models only to assist us in comprehensively evaluating the superiority of our method.\n\nMoreover, the empirical results in our paper can all be reproduced by the code we provide.\n\nQ3: The model used for the experiments is LeNet-5, which is not a reasonable model for most real-world applications. Furthermore, this model has been arbitrarily divided into feature extractor and classifier. The main argument of this work is that the latent feature space has so-called \"high-level patterns\" and it is difficult to construct the input data from these patterns. How accurate is this assumption when the feature extractor is simply a couple of conv layers? Moreover, the datasets used in this experiment are also not representative (very low resolutions images with utmost 10 classes). How will the proposed approach scale for larger resolution images (e.g., 224 x 224) with deeper neural networks (e.g., ResNet-18) and more classes (e.g., ImageNet)?\n\nR3: We agree with this point about its application to intricate data and model scenarios. However, all our experiments are conducted on one NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with 32Gb of memory, thus running FedMD-CG and baselines on the intricate data and model would incur extreme time costs. Also, we follow existing work FedCG [1] and FedGen [2] to setup backbone architectures (i.e., LeNet-5) in our work. On this account, we concentrated on robust empirical validation, showcasing our method (FedMD-CG). \n\nWe are honored to address your uncertainties and concerns. We remain dedicated to addressing concerns you may possess with utmost eagerness.\n\n[1] Wu, Y., Kang, Y., Luo, J., He, Y., & Yang, Q.

(2) and update it in the revised paper.\n\nQ2: At the end of page 3 of the paper, the author claims to design two loss functions. to transfer the knowledge of the local model to the local generator. Does this imply that the losses in formulas (5) and (6) will only find gradients for generators?\n\nR2: No, it dose not. During the experiments, gradients of generators and classifiers can be obtained by backpropagation, but we only update generators at this stage.\n\nQ3: When the server trains its own model, does it need the label y to calculate losses and gradients?
