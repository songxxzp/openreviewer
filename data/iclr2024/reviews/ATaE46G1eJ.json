I wonder how is the SegPGD[1] perform in optical flow task?\n\n4\uff09 In **Sec4.3** the authors said \"We observe that at low number of attack iterations (3 attack iterations) it performs significantly worse than PGD, thus demonstrating its limitation on this task.\" However, the SegPGD[1] is need to adjust their balance factor during the attack iteration, and as far as I know, white box attacks usually don't compare attack performance at low iterations. So I do not think it is fair to compare with SegPGD[1] in 3 attack iterations.\n\nRef. [1] Gu J, Zhao H, Tresp V, et al.

The absence of corresponding experiments makes it challenging to completely establish the effectiveness of this aspect.\n\n2. An inquiry arises regarding the rationale behind the author's choice of an optical flow experiment to evaluate the versatility of CosPGD. The choice of optical flow as a benchmark should be substantiated by explaining how the characteristics of this task effectively highlight the advantages of CosPGD. Furthermore, additional experiments should be incorporated to showcase CosPGD's performance in various image restoration tasks, such as single image deraining, to bolster its claims further.\n\n3.

Experimental results demonstrate that this modification results in a more effective attack.\n\n2. CosPGD is applicable to a variety of pixel-wise prediction tasks, including semantic segmentation, optical flow prediction, and image restoration.

Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of CosPGD on several pixel-wise prediction tasks.\n\n3.
