However, in my understanding, this paper applies the existing framework of supervised contrastive learning [1] to EEG signals. Many relevant works are not cited: for example, consider [2] which also uses contrastive learning to learn representations from EEG signals and also demonstrates that the representations cluster following age group and other features. \n\nMapping the brain response to the stimulus is called \"decoding\" in the neuroscience literature [3]: it would be worth using this terminology. \n\nSome citations could be added to support strong statements that begin a paragraph, e.g. \"as human is known to respond strongly to facial stimuli\" (missing citation) or \"leverages a fundamental observation that the human brain response to differences in perception\" (missing citation). \n\nSome technical terms (e.g. \"visual saliency\" and \"semantic saliency\" in the abstract, \"epochs\" in the preprocessing paragraph) are used without being defined.

Yet it is known that a contrastive loss performs clustering by design [1], so that \"positive\" pairs (here, a stimulus and corresponding brain response) are given \"close\" embeddings, and \"negative\" pairs (here, a stimulus and random brain response) are given \"far\" embeddings. So Table 3 and Figure 3 are entirely expected. Could the authors comment on that? \n\nSome details are missing in the data preprocessing.

Moreover, simple reverse versions of these can be developed to use as baselines.\n\n- It would be valuable to see the impact of the CLIP loss by exploring and comparing other ones as well.\n\n- There's a small error in Fig 1, \"Find-tuning\" --> Fine-tuning  \n\n- While the RQs are very interesting, I wonder whether the outcome is completely expected. Given that we can map EEG to certain classes/actions/objects (e.g., affect classes, objects, directions, etc.), doesn't the outcome become expected? In other words, the method is mapping two high-dimensional data points onto a common lower dimensional feature space, where the locality of the image embeddings is used as the supervisory signal. Can the authors please (a) provide a discussion on this, (b) show the common embedding space (using tSNE, UMAP, etc) to extract some more insights about the reason behind why the method works.
