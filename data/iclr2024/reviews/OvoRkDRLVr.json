Could you please clarify the reason behind this? If this drop is due to competition among different modalities, do you propose any solutions to mitigate this issue?\n4.

If not, I think the effective reasoning ability of your proposed framework comes from the encoders themselves, not from the framework.\n- My question about Q-Former and LLM is stated in the second point I mentioned in the Weaknesses section, I wonder the superiority of the whole framework is provided by Q-Former or by LLM itself? It would be great if the authors could provide some relevant experimental proofs!\n- The DisCRn dataset only covers the same modality or two modalities, how does the model behave when it receives more modalities? For example, how does the model behave when it receives data input from three or four modalities at the same time?\n- In the paper(section 3.2), the authors mention to manually change the sampling rate of MSCOCO and MSRVTT during the training phase,  why this change should be made instead of following the formulas presented in the paper?\n- In the experimental section, I noticed that the authors' models with different parameter counts performed inconsistently. Generally speaking, the more parameters a model with the same architecture has, the better the experiment results will be, but I have seen on quite a few tasks that the model with the largest number of parameters (13b) does not work as well as the model with a smaller number of parameters (7b), so I hope that authors could provide an answer to this question"

Is it because of the data, or the modeling, or something else? Please be specific and discuss instead of listing numbers in the experimental section.\n\n- The paper is about extending the InstructBLIP to multimodality settings, but from the results i dont see the evidence that the multimodality setting here is better than the single modality setting.

                "value": "**The motivation is clear and the method is effective.** It is important to unlock the ability of LLM to seamlessly integrate and manage any number of modalities. The proposed Modality-X Q-former is simple and effective.\n\n**The DISCRN evaluation dataset is useful.** It may be useful for evaluation across each of the modalities (images, video, audio, and 3D) alignment."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**The writing is bad.** It is not clear what is \"an ad-hoc number of modalities\", do you mean that can extend to any modalities? And in the introduction, it is not clear the differences between your methods with ImagenBind, Imagebind-LLM, and Pandagpt, Can you give me more analysis? In the method section, it is not clear how to train the model with modality-X Q-former, can you provide an algorithm for it?  What about the loss function?\n\n**The proposal method does not have enough technical contribution.** The framework of the methods is more like the BLIP2 with Q-former to more modality. It can not provide more technical insight to the community.\n\n**The experiment is not convincing.** As shown in Table 1 and Table 2 have shown that the X-instructBLIP is not significantly improved with other methods. More importantly, it seems to lack many comparisons, e.g. LLAVA/LLAVA1.5, ImageBind, ImageBind-LLM."
