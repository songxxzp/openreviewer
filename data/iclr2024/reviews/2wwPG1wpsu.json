                "value": "In spite of the widespread use of time series forecasting models, there are limited benchmarks for assessing the quality of different models in specific settings. In this work, the authors focus on model performance when applied to long-horizon forecasting, and demonstrate that all models perform poorly for datapoints further into the future - the authors refer to this problem as \u201cdegeneracy\u201d. Although some existing models perform better than others, the analysis reveals a wider problem, and the authors call for further research into why performance degrades in such settings."

The authors did not share the time series yet; however, I would not expect there to be much diversity among these new time series. A well-developed benchmark should cover additional time series from different domains, and hence I don\u2019t see this addition as being particularly noteworthy.\n- The insights gleaned from the paper are very limited, as the authors primarily present empirical evidence of the degraded performance over longer horizons without much novel perceptions. Although I appreciate the evaluation presented by the authors in this work, I don\u2019t think the paper feels complete without a clearer vision of how the issues identified here can be effectively resolved or at least partially mitigated in a tangible manner.\n- In the evaluation, the authors comment on how the default hyper-parameters were selected for the models under review. I can see how this simplifies the experimental set-up, but I\u2019m also left wondering about the extent to which adequate hyper-parameter optimisation could improve the reported results.\n- Unfortunately, the paper\u2019s writing isn\u2019t very compelling, and the overall structuring seems more akin to a technical report than a conference paper."

The authors found a phenomenon referred to as \"degeneracy\", which means the low MSE value but with predictions having repetitive and simplistic pattern generations. Additionally, the authors found that the optimal performance is very close to its performance after training just one epoch. The authors claimed their benchmark work serves as valuable resource for advancing research in the field of timeseries forecasting."

The benchmark includes four types of models and evaluates them on a variety of datasets, including a new dataset called NEW. The experimental results show that all models exhibit significantly faster convergence compared to models in other domains, but also exhibit a phenomenon called Degeneracy, which signifies that the model's predictions exhibit lower MSE/MAE values, yet in fact, the forecasted outcomes tend to manifest as periodic repetitions, failing to genuinely predict the future data. The paper emphasizes the need for further investigation to address this issue and to reevaluate or redefine evaluation metrics applicable to time series forecasting to more accurately measure model performance, model design, and improvement on that. The paper also discusses the limitations of the benchmark, such as the input being limited to a single time series and not allowing for the inclusion of external features."
