An additional ablation using only the arms, A_k = Enc(A_k), would be informative.\n- It is unclear / not evaluated, how much the method relies on the availability of high-quality reference ligands vs the generative capabilities of the diffusion model.

While the article acknowledges the importance of the property, it doesn't directly address it.\n\n   a) Which part of the article is designed to address QED or easily synthesizable compounds?\n\n   b) The Vina score from Table 1 appears to be subpar. Although I understand that the Vina score may not be the most suitable metric due to its weak correlation with affinity, the authors use it for optimization and as an indicator for data analysis(Figure 1). This raises the question of why they emphasize the results of Vina min and but not reporting the median or some other indicator.\n\n2. I am curious about the inference efficiency of the diffusion model. Since diffusion models are not known for their efficiency during inference, could the authors compare the generation efficiency of the proposed method with that of other models?\n\n3. Did the authors evaluate the rationality of the generated conformations? For instance, did they assess the energy difference before and after force field optimization? As diffusion-based models like DecompDiff has problems with this.\n\n4. The second case in Figure 3 seems questionable or may be difficult to interpret. I recommend redrawing it for clarity.\n\n5. Scaffold hopping is an interesting aspect, but the authors have not considered the potential changes in molecular properties (vina score, for example) after the hopping process."

                "value": "- The writing is easy to follow. The concept figure also aids the understanding.\n- The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and ablation studies were also conducted. The experiments about controllability (R-group optimization and scaffold hopping) seem interesting."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The authors did not provide the codebase to reproduce the results.\n- The authors used the term *controllable generation* to indicate tasks like R-group design and scaffold hopping. However, *controllable* is a widely used expression with a general meaning and *de novo* molecular design can also be controllable in a broad sense. There is some lack of rigor in the choice of wording."

One of the claimed contributions is that the authors designed a unified framework via a decomposed diffusion model (the 3rd bullet point in the introduction), but DecompDiff has already proposed and applied this to SBDD."
