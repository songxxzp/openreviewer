To motivate the approach, the paper discusses the link between inputs being out of manifold for consecutive layers, and the difference in the intrinsic dimensionality of these layers. Then, since language models exhibit a monotonically decreasing *intrinsic dimensionality (ID)* of their representations throughout layers, the optimal layer to generate adversarial examples from is the last layer. Using only the last layer in the forward-backward passes of PGD to generate adversarial examples is much more efficient than using the full model. Finally, the paper shows that on top of the efficiency of the proposed approach, the defended models are more robust than recent defenses against common adversarial attacks for text on three text classification benchmarks."

It is critical as it links the search for the optimal layer $l^*$ to theorem 3.1.\n- In theorem 3.1, the proof in Appendix is given for the opposite side: If $||(I - U_{(i-1)} U_{(i-1)}^\\top)\\delta_{(i-1)}|| < ||(I-U_i U_i^\\top)\\delta_i||$ then $rank(i-1) < rank(i)$. There is also the equality case that is included in the theorem but not in the proof. Maybe the inequalities should be reversed in the formulation of the theorem, which would make a proof by contraposition ? This would also make sense with the remaining of the paper, since we observe decreasing ID and not increasing ID.\n- Similarly, for the objectives of SMAAT (eq. 9 and 10), the inequalities on the ID do not make sense since we observe decreasing ID throughout the layers. I think the inequality should be reversed as well, i.e. $ID(i) < ID(i-1)$.\n-  What is k and $U_l^k$ in the computation of ID (equation 11) ? I assume it is the k first rows and columns of $U_l$, which would make ID close to the rank of the representation. This should be clarified, as well as the link between ID and the rank, since the theorem is stated using the *rank operator*.\n-  What is $\\lambda_{max}$ ? Is it the maximum eigenvalue ? If so, I'm unsure about the assumption used in the proof of theorem 3.1 about the ratio of $\\lambda_{max}$. There is an additional layer in the network from which the jacobian is computed in the numerator, thus the Lipschitz constant of the numerator is greater than the one of the denominator, making the ratio greater than 1. Does the remaining of the proof holds with this ? \n-  The proposed approach is interestingly the opposite of YOPO [1], can the authors develop on the link and differences regarding this method ?\n\n[1] Zhang et al., You Only Propagate Once: Accelerating Adversarial Training via Maximal Principle, NeurIPS 2019."
