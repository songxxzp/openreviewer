Further, in the Text2Video Zero paper, they compare with CogVideo, which is also ignored in this work.\n2. Missing ablation. The authors didn't provide any ablation study in the paper which is very important to demonstrate the effectiveness of each design.\n3. Organization needs to be improved.

The core of its method is a dependency noise model, which tries to minimize the KL divergence between adjacent frames. To restrict the initial noise not to deviate significantly from the normal distribution, the author only optimizes the KL divergence with line search. The second component of the method is momentum attention, which replaces the Key and Value in 2D attention with the temporal momentum of the keys and values. \n- The author showed most of the video generation results only with a few frames(8 frames), and a few with 128 frames. All the results are shown with low resolutions. For experimental comparison, the author compared with Text2Video-Zero and direct random noise sampling only using CLIP-scores (which does not make sense for video generation), and showed two sets of visual comparisons with other state-of-the-art video generations."

Only one set of clip scores is reported, and clip score is not a good metric for video generation!(It does not consider temporal consistency) I recommend the author add more metrics like Frechet Video Distance (FVD) (Unterthiner et al., 2018), and Kernel Video Distance (KVD) (Unterthiner et al., 2019). \n    - The proposed algorithm is training-free, so it can easily generate high-resolution videos using high-resolution text-to-image models like SDXL. It would be great for the author to add more high-resolution results.\n    - For visual comparison, adding more videos, especially videos with higher frame rates in supplementary materials or external websites, is very helpful. Also user study is welcomed for more solid evaluations. \n- The presentation has some weaknesses.\n    - The first paragraph of section 2: \"Present text-to-video synthesis techniques either require costly training on large-scale text-video paired data ...., or necessitate fine-tuning on a reference video...\". This sentence is logically wrong since the author cited some training-free video generation methods, like the text2video-zero.\n    - In figures 2,3,4,5... The font in the figure is too small. It would be better to improve the font size.\n- Ablations of the two proposed components is missing. It would be interesting to see what the videos will be like without the momentum attention, or without the dependency noise sampling."

One can not derive one variable from the other by knowing the KL divergence between them. \n\n- For all qualitative results, there are a separate column in the right end, which seemingly tries to show image generation results? I don't know what that column stands for.\n\n- It doesn't indicate the video quality by computing the CLIP score and comparing with image models. Better metric would be e.g., FVD. \n\n- It is difficult to compare with other baseline approaches by only checking Figure 5, which generates videos with completely different text prompts, random seeds and resolutions."
