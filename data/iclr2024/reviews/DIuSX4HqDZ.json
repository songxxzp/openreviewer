It proposes a generation-based method to address knowledge graph incompleteness and reasoning efficiency by generating logical hypotheses. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of their proposed reinforcement learning from knowledge graphs (RLF-KG) to enhance the hypothesis generation model by leveraging feedback from knowledge graphs. The paper also discusses the tokenization of hypotheses and the use of reinforcement learning to optimize the hypothesis generation model. Overall, the paper aims to utilize information from knowledge graphs to find complex structured hypotheses that explain observations."

The task learns a first-order hypothesis that satisfies given groundings, and the generated hypothesis is used for generalising to more unseen groundings. Logical abduction means a grounding-to-grounding hypothesizing, for example, given P(x)->Q(x), observing Q(1), we can abduce P(1). If you want to abduce first-order theories, the you need second-order rules as background knowledge.\n- The presentation of this work can be significantly improved. The description of the proposed method is messy. For example, the caption of Figure 4 is \"step 3\", which is out of blue and makes reader confusing. Furthermore, the illustration of figures and algorithms are also confusing. There's no input and output in algorithms, and what are \"models\" and \"reference models\" in Fig. 4?\n- Fig. 5 proposes 13 types of first-order hypotheses templates, are they complete for the hypothesis space? Is there any proof to the completeness?"

Algorithms are presented for (1) sampling hypothesis-observation pairs from a KG under the open-world assumption and (2) implementing reinforcement training from KG feedback.  Additional transformation algorithms (token-to-graph and graph-to-token) that assist in the sampling process are presented.  The authors demonstrate the relative effectiveness of each sub-component of their overall method on three well know datasets."

There are many possible formal definitions for abduction, and you choose two slightly different versions in your discussion (one in the abstract, and one in Section 2).  Can you provide a precise statement of what you mean by abduction, rather than proceed by analogy?  For instance, the last paragraph of section 2 mentions \"best explanation\" without providing a quotative definition of best.   Can you connect such precision to your actual implementation?  For instance a precise definition might be made to which your algorithm is an approximation, or a precise definition might be supplied for which your algorithm is an exact solution."

                "value": "- In my view, the term of abductive  reasoning is incorrectly used. The process of obtaining hypothesis based on observations and background knowledge is called induction. Abductive reasoning further requires to obtain groundings for variables in the hypothesis. \n\n- The paper misses citation to researches on inductive logic programming (ILP), which is closely related to the problem studied in the paper. An ILP task involves learning logic programs based on logic observations and background knowledge, which is more general than reasoning on knowledge graphs. Furthermore, the term abductive learning has also be proposed before in the ILP area [1]. Related citations should be included and discussed in the paper.\n\n- The experimental results are only quantitative. It would nicer to illustrate some qualitative examples on what kinds of hypotheses can be learned by the proposed method. For example, it would be useful to illustrate whether the proposed approach can learn lengthy hypotheses with significant complexity.\n\n[1] Bridging Machine Learning and Logical Reasoning by Abductive Learning, NeurIPS'19."

                "value": "- On the bottom of Page 3, it is said that the logic clauses contains only three operations $\\cup, \\cap, \\neg$. Does this mean that the paper only considers a limited subset of first-order logic? (e.g. propositional logic). Even though this would be enough for knowledge graphs, which can only represent relational information, clarifying the scope of learning is still necessary."
