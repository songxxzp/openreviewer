                "value": "This paper tries to mitigate the open-set noisy labels in a federated setting based on the loss correction method in centralized noisy label learning. In a centralized setting, the loss correction method needs to estimate a label transformation matrix to correct the overall loss values, which can be unachievable for federated learning due to the fact the local noise pattern is different overall clients in \u201copenset federated noisy label\u201d setting. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a method of sharing local flipped labels to servers with a privacy guarantee from label differential privacy (LDP). Then, the server can calculate the posterior label distribution and send it to a client. On local training, each client utilizes the posterior label distribution and LDP distribution to fix the local training loss function. Also, contrastive learning is utilized in local training to boost performance."

According to the standard definition of 'openset' in machine learning, the term typically refers to a scenario where there are two distinct label sets: known labels and unknown labels. In this paper, such a clear distinction between known and unknown label sets is not provided. Instead, the paper focuses on addressing a different issue related to class imbalance, which is more characteristic of non-IID federated learning. Consequently, it is not entirely accurate to claim that this paper solves the 'openset noise' problem in federated learning. Furthermore, it remains unclear how the proposed methods would perform in addressing a genuine openset noise problem, as the server might struggle to initialize T_DP without knowledge of both known and unknown labels.\n\n2. The stability of the results in Table 3, particularly when the differential privacy noise level (e) is set to 100, raises questions. It is important to provide a detailed explanation of why the performance remains largely unaffected at this noise level and how this stability aligns with the theoretical guarantees of the proposed approach. \n\n3.
