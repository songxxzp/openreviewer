                "value": "In this paper, the authors present a novel neural network-based method for approximating the generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) within pseudo-games derived from a specific distribution. These pseudo-games consist of players operating within compact and convex action spaces, where the choices made by each player can influence the feasible action space of others.\n\nTo facilitate the training of the GNE neural network solver, the authors introduce exploitability as the loss function.  Exploitability quantifies the total utility gains that all players would achieve by deviating to their own best responses. However, calculating exploitability poses a challenge due to the potentially infinite action space. To tackle this issue, an adversarial network is employed to approximate each player's best response.\n\nThe authors also establish a theoretical framework by providing a generalization bound for this neural solver. Furthermore, in practical experiments, they apply this approach to identify Nash equilibria in normal-form games, compute competitive equilibria in Arrow-Debreu economic models, and determine GNE in an environmental economic model involving the Kyoto mechanism."

                "value": "There are some soundness issues that the authors have to address. First, there appears to be a significant gap between the theoretical analysis and the experimental settings. Specifically, it is not clear how a stationary point in the sense of Theorem 4.1 translates to a GNE. If stationary points are not necessarily GNE, the narrative of the paper has to be restructured. In particular, it is often claimed that the method maps pseudo-games to GNE, and it is not clear whether that claim is theoretically sound. Of course, computing GNE is intractable, but it is alluded (for example in the abstract) that under a distribution over problem instances the problem could be easier. Theorem 4.1 also makes a strong concavity assumption which appears to be violated in all settings of interest. It should be the case that a \"small\" regularizer can always be incorporated without affecting the equilibria by much, but I think this should be discussed in more detail. \n\nI am also confused about Footnote 4. It is claimed that the method obtains the state of the art $O(1/\\epsilon^3)$ complexity, a major improvement over $O(1/\\epsilon^6)$, which the authors claim was the previous state of the art. The authors have to explain more precisely the class of problems this applies to; there are many variants of the PL condition studied in the literature. In particular, the following papers seem to obtain a much better dependency: \"Faster single-loop algorithms for minimax optimization without strong concavity,\" \"faster stochastic algoritms for minimax optimization under Polyak-Lojasiewicz Conditions\" and \"Doubly smoothed GDA for constrained nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization.\"\n\nBesides the issues above, the algorithmic approach is very close to the paper \"Exploitability minimization in games and beyond,\" which limits to some extent the algorithmic contribution of the present paper. The authors have to highlight the comparisons in more detail."
