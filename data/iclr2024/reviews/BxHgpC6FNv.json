However, after some time in training, the Grokking phenomenon occurs, and the network achieves near-optimal test accuracy while still adapting to the random labels in the training data, demonstrating benign overfitting."

Through rigorous theoretical analysis and proofs, the study reveals that these surprising phenomena are evident in the networks' training trajectories, providing a nuanced understanding of overfitting and generalization in neural network models.\n\nThe paper's contributions lie in providing the first theoretical insights into benign overfitting in non-linearly separable data distributions, unraveling the feature learning dynamics under gradient descent.

Generally, increasing the number of samples, even with limited noisy labels, tends to enhance the generalization capability of neural networks.

This aspect might require further clarification or justification within the context of the study.\n\n* The mechanism of overfitting, once the neural network learns the directions of $u_1$ and $u_2$. is not explicitly clear. The paper mentions that post the initial gradient step, positive neurons learn $u_1$ while negative neurons learn $u_2$. However, the explanation seems lacking in how the network overfits to samples with noisy (flipped) labels in this condition. A more detailed discussion or clarification on this would be beneficial.\n\n* The role of Lemma 4.6 in the paper is unclear. A clearer explanation of how it relates to other parts of the paper and how it contributes to the overall arguments and conclusions is needed for better understanding. \n\n* The paper seems to lack a comparative discussion with some relevant works, specifically references [1,2].\n\n\n[1] Meng, Xuran, Difan Zou, and Yuan Cao. \"Benign Overfitting in Two-Layer ReLU Convolutional Neural Networks for XOR Data.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.01975 (2023).\n\n[2] Glasgow, Margalit. \"SGD Finds then Tunes Features in Two-Layer Neural Networks with near-Optimal Sample Complexity: A Case Study in the XOR problem.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.15111 (2023)."

I think XOR cluster data is a good starting point to this problem and this paper proves benign overfitting under moderate assumptions.\n\n### Providing useful theoretical understandings on grokking\n\nAs well as benign overfitting result, this paper also proves that after one large (compared to the initialization scale) gradient step, the neural network approximately behaves as the linear model and perfectly overfit to the training data. The phenomena that the early stage of training only produces the linear model but there is a transition to the nonlinear neural network with richer features is particularly interesting, providing one of the first rigorous theoretical demonstrations of grokking.\n\n### The paper is well written and clearly explaining its theoretical key points.\n\nThe proof sketch section is well-written and provides a sufficient understanding of the overall theoretical contributions. It is expected that the techniques presented in this paper will also be valuable in demonstrating the potential for more enriching feature learning in the future."
