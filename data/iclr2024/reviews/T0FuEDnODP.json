                "value": "1. Novelty and Clarifications: The proposed approach may lack technical novelty as it primarily involves altering the direction of edges or discarding them altogether.  Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the proposed approach can be adapted for use in directed graphs, where edge direction is a critical factor, leaving a gap in its applicability.\nFurthermore, the authors claim that the model can efficiently filter out irrelevant information by focusing on the shortest path connecting two nodes to maximize information flow to the target node. However, due to the node-based nature of the actions, there is a significant risk that a node, for example, u_1, may be irrelevant for one node, u_2, but important for another node, u_3. With the current framework, if node u_1 chooses to listen and not broadcast, it won't be able to transmit information to u_3, creating a potential limitation in information flow within the model.\nIn contrast, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) can address similar challenges by focusing on edge-based attention scores, allowing for fine-grained control over information transmission. GATs can effectively filter out irrelevant information by learning attention scores close to zero, similar to the \"listen and not broadcasting\" actions mentioned in the proposed framework. A thorough discussion of the similarities and differences between the proposed approach and GATs, as well as other relevant models, would enhance the paper's clarity and its position in the context of existing graph neural network research.\n\n2. Expressivity: Since the sampling process can introduce variability, it's possible for two identical graphs to obtain different representations due to the differences in sampled action. While this non-deterministic behavior enhances expressiveness, it's essential to be aware of it when working with CO-GNNs, as it may introduce variability in model outcomes and representations, even for isomorphic graphs. A proper discussion of this limitation is currently missing.\n\n3. Experiments: The experimental evaluation is weak. Several strong baselines are missing (see below for some examples [1,2,3] ) and some well-known graph and node classification datasets are missing as well (REDDIT-BINARY, REDDIT-MULTI, Cora, Citeseer, Texas, Wisconsin, Cornell etc). Moreover,  the proposed approach does not significantly outperform the simple GIN model in most cases.  \n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Zhang, Muhan, and Pan Li. \"Nested graph neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 15734-15747.\n\n[2] Pasa, L., Navarin, N. & Sperduti, A.
