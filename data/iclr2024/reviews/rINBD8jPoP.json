The main contributions include a tensor-based binary encoding scheme, a mechanism of illegal actions to prune the search space and avoid redundant gates, and a random halting technique to encourage the agent to find shorter circuits. Additionally, it presents a variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm with adaptive momentum and variable sample budget for faster and robust optimization, and a fast GPU simulation framework using Pauli transfer matrix formalism to fuse gates with their noise models. The effectiveness of CRLQAS is demonstrated on quantum chemistry tasks of finding the ground state energy of various molecules, such as H2, LiH, and H2O, in both noiseless and noisy settings."

If the 'sto-3g' function is used, the claim of achieving chemical accuracy might be an overstatement. While it's not impossible, further clarification is necessary.\n\n2. I'm concerned about the computational cost and efficiency of the reinforcement learning approach, especially when adding the noise injection method. Even with GPU acceleration, reinforcement learning is inherently expensive. Given that the noise model is derived from \"current\" calibration data and the gate-level noise model is only an approximation, there are concerns about its accuracy. For instance, although noise might seem stable over a short time frame, over a more extended period (e.g., a week), one can observe significant shifts. If the framework has a high computational cost, it may yield unreliable results if the calibration data changes rapidly during training.\n\n3. Some parts of the paper could be clearer. For example, Table 4 should specify which molecule task is being discussed. There are several sections in the paper with similar clarity issues, making it harder to understand.\n\n4. I observed that only one quantum architecture search work is considered in the comparative experiments. There are many other relevant works in the quantum architecture search for VQE, such as:\n\n[1] Wang, Hanrui, et al. \"Quantumnas: Noise-adaptive search for robust quantum circuits.\" 2022 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA).

However, the increased computational cost is also a concern.\n\n5.There's a notable absence of results on real quantum hardware. Testing only on a noisy simulator might not be entirely convincing, especially when using reinforcement learning, which is assumed to achieve the upper bound of performance. Given that you utilize a noise model from the current noisy environment and consider only one seed, real hardware testing is crucial."

The use of the Pauli transfer matrix formalism in this algorithm marks a substantial improvement in the simulation of noisy quantum circuits, significantly reducing computational time and increasing simulation fidelity. \n\nIn addition to the quantum-specific advancements, the paper contributes to the field of RL by implementing a 3-D architecture encoding and an episode halting mechanism within its curriculum-based framework, enhancing the RL agent's ability to discover shorter and more hardware-efficient circuit architectures rapidly. The introduction of a novel optimization technique further refines the learning process, facilitating faster convergence and potentially leading to more robust quantum computing solutions. These combined strengths showcase the paper's dual focus on developing an efficient simulation that carefully accounts for quantum noise and on refining RL techniques to ensure that the architecture search yields practical, hardware-efficient designs."

Therefore, it is recommended that the authors include a link to the open-sourced code or an appendix containing the code in any subsequent revision of the paper. This addition would be a valuable resource for the community and would greatly facilitate further research and validation of the proposed methods.\n\nThe paper could be enhanced by broadening the scope of its comparative analysis with existing methodologies. While the current work focuses on a specific approach to quantum circuit optimization, there are alternative methods worth considering, such as those based on SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers. For instance, the technique presented by B. Tan and J. Cong in \"Optimal layout synthesis for quantum computing,\" (ICCAD, 2020) could serve as a valuable benchmark. It would be beneficial for the authors to include a comparison with these kinds of potentially optimal circuit compilers to contextualize the effectiveness of their proposed method when applied to analogous problems.\n\nFurthermore, the terminology used in the paper, specifically the term \"architecture,\" may lead to ambiguity within the broader scientific community. In the realm of computer architecture, \"architecture\" typically refers to the low-level hardware design, as discussed in sources like the one available on IEEE Xplore. Since this work is centered around the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits, and not the hardware itself, clarity could be improved by selecting a term that more accurately describes the subject of optimization. A term like \"circuit design\" or \"circuit configuration\" may better capture the essence of the research without the potential for misinterpretation."

Cong in ICCAD 2020, to provide a broader context and demonstrate the relative effectiveness of the proposed algorithm?\n\n3. Considering the potential for confusion within the interdisciplinary community, could the authors consider using a more precise term than \"architecture\" to describe the optimization of parameterized quantum circuits, thereby avoiding conflation with low-level hardware design?"

Nevertheless, the performance of VQA is significantly influenced by the choice of ansatz and noise effects. \n\nIn this paper, the authors adopt curriculum reinforcement learning for quantum architecture search (QAS), aiming to select ansatz with good performance under hardware errors. Specifically, they devise a CRLQAS algorithm with tensor-based 3-D encoding of quantum circuits, a random halting scheme to reduce the circuit length, and an variant of Adam-SPSA for better convergence. In addition, this work accecelerate simulation of noisy quantum circuits by employing pauli transfer matrix formalism. \n\nNumerical experiments on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate the performance of the proposed method under noiseless and noisy circumstances."

                "value": "- Originality: As far as I know, this is the first work to consider noise models from real quantum machines in RL-based QAS. Previous work focus on noiseless scenarios or only touch on simple noisy configurations. The setting of this work is closer to real applications in NISQ era, hence making it an advance over the previous state-of-the-art.\n- Quality: The paper proposes several techniques which are effective and easy to realize. The tensor-based binary encoding is straightforward but efficient and compact. Pruning of illegal actions successfully narrow the search space. Random Halting is introduced to reduce the training episodes, which is a major drawback of previous work. The offline computation with Pauli-transfer matrices and JAX achieves considerable acceleration for noise simulation.\n- Clarity: The main ideas and techniques in the paper are mostly clear, but many issues remain (see Weaknesses & Questions). \n- Significance: This paper seeks to tackle an important problem by considering noise of current devices in QAS for VQA, which is well-motivated. Literature discussing the negative impacts of noise on VQA has been thoroughly cited. The numerical demonstration of achieving chemical accuracy and outperforming previous methods is impressive."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The writing is poor, full of mistakes in grammar and notation. For example, the first sentence in the second paragraph of Section 3.6 is incomplete. There are erroneous notations such as  $T_{s}^{e}$ v.s $T_{s^{e}}$ in Section 3.3, wrong format of citation like (Wang et al., 2021) in introduction, inconsistent proper nouns such as \"ansatz\" v.s. \"ans{\\\"a}tze\", and numerous syntax errors. These issues impair the quality of the paper. \n- Originality: This paper extends the ideas from previous work (Ostaszewski et al., 2021). Some techniques such as feedback driven curriculum learning and Adam-SPSA seem to be the direct adaptation of existing methods.\n- Although several techniques are proposed, the paper may lack insights into which component principally improves the results, especially under noisy circumstances. It is unclear to me which technique is specialized for facilitating noise adaptations, rather than general improvement over existing methods.\n- Related to the previous question, in the noisy simulation section, the paper conducts no comparison with other RL-based QAS methods. Therefore it is unclear what is the improvement of this algorithm over previous methods in noisy environments. Moreover, for molecules such as LiH-4, the experiments only consider shot and 1-qubit depolarizing noise, which is far from real noise models. This undermines the persuasiveness of this work. \n- Important related work not discussed. Despite little consideration of noise in previous reinforcement learning methods for QAS, there have been many attempts in traditional architecture field. The paper may need more comparison with other QAS algorithms under hardware erors, especially those targeting noise-aware search, for example Wang et al. QuantumNAS 2022."

Also there is a repetition in the reference section, where \"Abhinav Kandala, Antonio Mezzacapo, Kristan Temme, Maika Takita, Markus Brink, Jerry M Chow, and Jay M Gambetta. Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets. nature, 549(7671):242\u2013246, 2017\" is listed twice.\n- Some descriptions are unclear to me. In Section 3.3, what does \"$n_s$ is the number of successes\" mean? Details in Section 3.4 could also be better stated. Moreover, from a reader's point of view, the organization of Section 3 is scattered and lacks emphasis on major contributions. \n- Does the model need retraining for different noise models to deliver competitive results? I am curious about the efficiency for adaptation to new noise models. Also I believe experiments on real quantum machines comparing the proposed method with other algorithms would make the work more solid.\n- Although the authors claim to tackle the general employment of VQAs, numerical experiments on applications are actually limited to VQE for quantum chemistry tasks. The authors should avoid overstatement, or apply the method to general VQA settings and tasks.\n- There is almost no discussion of limitations. What is the weakness of this method and what are the potential future directions?"
