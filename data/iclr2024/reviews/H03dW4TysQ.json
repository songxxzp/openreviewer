However, the paper does not provide a comprehensive explanation of why it is inefficient and wasteful. Furthermore, Figure 1 also fails to illustrate this point. 3) In the Introduction, the paper mentioned \u201c\u2026often fall short in preserving the performance attributes of diffusion models\u201d. The paper also does not provide a comprehensive explanation of why these methods are \u201cfall short in preserving the performance\u2026\u201d. As such, it is recommended that further provide qualitative and quantitative experiments. The same issue still applies to the remaining sections.\n2.As mentioned in the paper, the term 'minimal computational cost' is used, but it lacks a clear definition, making it a concept that may lead to confusion.\n3.In Section 3.1, the paper mentions that the convolutional layers 'constitute approximately 80% of the model\u2019s parameters.' However, the paper does not provide the calculation method used to obtain this value.\n4.Why setting diffusion models to zero is work ? \n5.It\u2019s better to provide experiments comparing with model acceletion methods (DPM-Solver, DPM-Solver++, DDIM, ToMe) to prove that MoEDM enhances the inference efficiency.\nDDIM: Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models;\nToMe: Token merging for fast stable diffusion; \nDPM-Solver: A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps; \nDPM-Solver++: Fast Solver for Guided Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models;\nThe experimental validation is not convincing:\n1.The paper only provides 64x64 and 256x256 resolution outputs, while diffuison-based models can generate high-resolution results of 512x512 (e.g., Stable DIffusion).\n2.In this paper, the proposed method aims to reduce computational costs, but its effectiveness may not be fully convincing. Training experiments require 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and even for sampling, a single NVIDIA A100 with 80GB of memory is needed.\n3.It would be more valuable to see if this method can be built with more diffusion models, like Stable Diffusion and DeepFloyd-IF.\nIt would be better to compare the proposed method with current personalization methods based on diffusion models, such as CustomDiffusion and DreamBooth.\nCustomDiffusion: Multi-Concept Customization of Text-to-Image Diffusion; DreamBooth: Fine Tuning Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Subject-Driven Generation;"

The concept of layer removal has precedents, such as in the design of SDXL [1]. Additionally, the current application of Mixture of Experts (MOE) seems to follow familiar patterns, similar to those seen in EDiff-I [2], which might benefit from a more rigorous comparative analysis. The use of distillation to enhance data efficiency is an interesting approach, though its integration with the other proposed methods (aiming for efficiency improvements) appears tangential and warrants a clearer rationale.\n\nW2: The experimental validation presented could be more robust. The majority of efficiency gains appear attributable to the removal of intermediate layers, raising questions about the relative contribution of other proposed innovations. The focus on a singular class from ImageNet may not sufficiently demonstrate the model's generalizability. For the text-to-image results, the paper only present a few curated images, and it would benefit from a broader set of comparisons to fully ascertain the model's effectiveness.\n\nW3: The clarity and structure of the paper would greatly benefit from revision. For instance, the processes following the removal of intermediate layers, including whether the model undergoes fine-tuning with the original dataset, are not clearly outlined. A more detailed discussion in the technical sections, perhaps with an expanded explanation of the loss functions used, would enhance the reader's understanding. \n\nIn conclusion, the core ideas of the paper are interesting, yet the manuscript would benefit from substantial revisions to meet the acceptance bar. I would encourage the authors to consider this feedback constructively, make the necessary improvements, and consider resubmission to an alternative venue for a future iteration of their work.\n\n[1] Podell, Dustin, et al. \"Sdxl: Improving latent diffusion models for high-resolution image synthesis.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2307.01952 (2023).\n\n[2] Balaji, Yogesh, et al. \"ediffi: Text-to-image diffusion models with an ensemble of expert denoisers.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.01324 (2022)."
