For the task-specific parameters, logarithm transformations are applied to the loss so that all losses have similar scales. Ablation studies show that each of the proposed strategies can enhance other complementary methods. Besides, combining the two balancing can surpass all previous methods."

                "value": "1. **Imprecise Overview of the MTL Objective:** The MTL objective (Equation 1) in Section 2 is imprecise. It is applicable primarily to existing loss balancing and certain gradient balancing methods. For example, in some gradient balancing methods like PCGrad and CAGrad, the weights of task-specific parameters are all 1, and in all hybrid balancing methods, the weights of task-specific and task-shared parameters are different.\n2. **Omission of Relevant Literature:**   (1) The DB-MTL method, albeit not defined as such within the text, is one of hybrid balancing methods. However, the treatment of hybrid balancing in Section 2 is overly simplistic and lacks a formal definition, along with an inadequate reference to relevant literature. For instance, approaches like RLW, Auto-\u03bb[1] and IGB[2] have also conducted exploratory work combining loss balancing and gradient balancing.    (2) In the discussion part of Section 3.1, IGB[2] has also studied the logarithm transformation and has further extended it into a new loss balancing paradigm.\n3. **Lack of Novelty:** The proposed loss balancing method, as well as the combination of loss and gradient balancing, have been previously discussed and experimented in prior works.\n4. **Lack of Theoretical Analysis:** Though the proposed method is easy to understand intuitively, it lacks theoretical understanding about why the proposed gradient balancing is beneficial for the overall MTL objective. In terms of gradients, the primary factor affecting the MTL performance is gradient conflicts, specifically the conflicts in gradient directions. The discrepancy in the magnitude of gradients does not lead to performance degradation if their directions are aligned. How does the proposed gradient balancing method directly or indirectly mitigate the conflicts in gradient directions? Are there any theoretical analyses, empirical experiments (maybe toy examples), or even intuitive explanations?\n5. **Fairness of Comparative Experiments:** Combining loss balancing and gradient balancing is beneficial. Thus, directly comparing MB-MTL with existing gradient balancing methods might introduce unfairness. In the image classification scenario, when only the proposed gradient-magnitude balancing is employed, the performance is not optimal within gradient balancing methods (NashMTL yields better results). Would combining logarithmic transformation with NashMTL surpass MB-MTL?\n\n[1] Auto-\u03bb: Disentangling Dynamic Task Relationships.

The work is grounded on the observation that differences in loss scales and gradient magnitudes across different tasks could negatively impact the performance of some tasks. The DB-MTL method is designed to balance these aspects at both the loss and gradient levels. It involves a logarithmic transformation on each task loss to ensure uniform scale, which is shown to also benefit existing gradient balancing techniques. Moreover, it also includes the normalization of all task gradients to the same magnitude to ensure respective uniformity. The researchers found that setting this magnitude as the maximum gradient norm yields the best performance. Comprehensive experiments have been performed on several benchmark datasets, and the results suggest that DB-MTL can achieve state-of-the-art performance. The primary contributions include the proposal of the DB-MTL method, empirical evidence of its effectiveness, and an illustration of the advantage of combining loss-scale balancing with gradient balancing."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "There is a significant lack of novelty in the presented techniques. The first part discusses scale-balancing loss transformation, which utilizes the common method of applying a log transformation to loss. This technique has already been mentioned by Nash-MTL and therefore doesn't contribute anything substantially new to the field.\nThe second section of the method, gradient normalization, is a modification of the GradNorm technique. The presented maximum-norm strategy essentially ensures all small-task gradients have the same norm as the task with the greatest gradient. While this may present an interesting approach, it is not substantially innovative. The final part of the paper brings together the previous two parts, but again, this combination doesn't present any great novelty or challenges. Consequently, the paper\u2019s primary contribution is the maximum-norm strategy, which is not significant enough.\n\nFrom the writing perspective, this paper reads more like a technical report or experiment report, where effective methods from previous work are summarized, but with few unique thoughts proposed.\n\nFrom an experimental perspective, the explanation of the maximum-norm strategy in section 3.2 lacks experimental support and could benefit from visual analysis. For example, the authors could investigate how using different alpha values impacts the optimization path or the decrease of loss in different tasks. This would provide a much-needed experimental grounding to the theoretical concepts presented in the paper. \n\nOverall, the paper needs more novelty and substantial analysis to make a significant contribution to the field."
