They first familiarizes the readers with the idea of varifolds consisting of a positional and Grassmannian component, which can be viewed as the joint representation consisting of points and normals. Then, the concept of neural tangent kernels is introduced to link the kernel theory and neural networks.  The NTK determines the distance between varifolds using neural networks. The authors then propose to represent point clouds using NTK to allow comparison in the varifold representation for conducting downstream tasks.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposal, the authors conduct experiments on point cloud classification, surface reconstruction and shape matching. Especially in tasks where the data is limited, the results demonstrate that the proposed representation is able to capture the characteristics of the underlying shape, showing promise for further analysis."

The representation as well as the derivation is  theoretically solid.\n\n- They propose two variants of the varifold representation using neural networks: NTK-1 and 2. The first separates the positional mass and the normal elements computes them separately, while the second jointly handles points and normals, as conventional point cloud neural network models do.\n\n- The task of using different metrics to conduct non-rigid registration is very interesting. As the proposed metric performs well in both cases of dolphin and cup, it seems to be a promising metric to compare different point cloud data and its underlying shapes."

The interesting results can be found in small-sample shape classification tasks, where the proposed method and representation outperformed other conventional methods. However in most other tasks, the method had been outperformed by conventional methods with presumably more expensive computation. Despite the authors\u2019 claim that the representation is able to extract both global and local shape similarities, the experiments demonstrate otherwise. It would have been better if the authors proposed a specific network structure that is able to take better advantage of the NTK representation. In order to compensate for the practical disadvantages, the authors could have introduced theoretical advantages over the conventional approaches. Such seems to be missing in the paper.\n\n- The non-rigid registration results are very interesting, however, only two samples were provided for the experiments. It would be more convincing to apply the method on various shapes to analyze the tendencies of the proposal. Therefore, I believe the experiments are incomplete.\n\n- Some ablation study had been conducted in the supplementary material by changing the number of layers of the target network. However, as the neural tangent kernel is derived from the study that links kernels to over-parameterized neural networks, it would have also been better to present results from neural network with different layer widths."

For example, change/defect detection within point cloud data may be one direction of possibilities, but as the method requires taking the mean of all the elements, I am presuming it is rather difficult.\n\n- What are the relationship between the proposed kernel and the network layers? Does the metric become more accurate as the width and number of layers increase? The authors do conduct analysis by changing the layers and comparing the final output, but I am curious about how relationship among shapes change according to the network structure. \n\n- As the method states, the NTK would be identical if the network tends to infinity, but as this is unrealistic, I believe there needs to be some practical solution to the network design. What justifies the selection of the current architecture?"
