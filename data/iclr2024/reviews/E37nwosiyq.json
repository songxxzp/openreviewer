Related to the above, if the authors think this is a novel task with no previously used benchmark, they should collect a new dataset of prompts with large diversity and design some evaluation metrics to quantitatively compare their methods and the baseline methods.\n3. The ``multi-concept'' seems to be a little bit over-claimed, since all the experiments in this paper consider at most 2 concepts. I would think that the method is not so useful if it cannot support more concepts. To avoid any potential cherry-picking, I suggest that the authors should provide at least 20 examples of image manipulation with more than 4 concepts."

Without any formal definition of each operation in the proposed algorithms, most of the parts are explained in text description.

For exampl,e in Algorithm 2, how does a Gaussian smoothing operation with kernel size 3 work on 4-dimensional tensor $A^C$?\n\n\nW3. The proposed approaches cannot be automated for arbitrary text prompts.

Although I understand the details of supervised contrastive loss, there is no detailed explanation how it is applied to multi-concept personalization.\n\nQ2. Can the proposed methods be used for a multi-concept image in terms of generation, manipulation, and personalization, where the number of concepts is larger than 2. How about the number of concepts increase from 2 to 5 or more?\n\nQ3. While the authors employ various hyper-parameters such as score-threshold, window size, correction strength, and the kernel of Gaussian smoothing operator, I wonder how the hyperparameter selection affects the generated images. In addition, are the hyper-parameters different according to text prompts, requiring hand-craft engineering per each text prompt?\n\nQ4. Can each algorithm stand alone without the other algorithm? \n\nQ5. How are the attention maps in this study visualized? Since there are multiple heads in cross-attention layers, explaining the details of visualization would be helpful for better understanding. In addition, the cross-attention map can be different according to the diffusion timesteps during image generation. \n\nQ6. Can the claimed effects be generalized to the multi-head attentions? I wonder whether the different scales between attention heads affect the concept of dominance or not. In addition, regarding cross-token non-maximum suppression, should each pixel be corresponded to one concept token over all attention heads? That is, although Algorithm 2 works for a head of cross-attention, the concept mixing between different attention heads can occur.\n\nQ7. In Algorithm 2, why is the shape of attention map $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h \\times w \\times w}$ instead of $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times h \\times w}$?\n\nQ8. In Line 5 of Algorithm 1, why does a threshold use a value between 0 and 1? Since $S^c$ is the result of element-wise multiplication of text embeddings, not a cosine similarity, I think each element of $S^c$ may not be in [0,1]. \n\nQ9. I wonder whether the Concept Dominance and Non-Localized Contribution occur together or occur independently according to text prompts. \n\nQ10. I think the number and diversity of examples in this paper is limited to understand the effect of the proposed methods. Can you provide more diverse examples with different length of text prompts and the number of concepts? In addition, using semantically similar multiple concepts for image generation will be an interesting analysis to demonstrate the proposed methods. \n\nQ11. In Figure 2, why are the results of (b) and (d) different? Since CLIP text encoders consist of a stack of attention blocks, the positional embedding determines the location of each token. Did you also switch the positional embedding in attentive pooling of the CLIP text encoder?  \n\nQ12. In Figure 6, the authors claim that Algorithm 1 reduces the dominance scale. Can you directly check out the reduced scale to demonstrate the effect of Algorithm 1?"
