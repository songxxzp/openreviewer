It also compares the stability of two rule extraction methods, quantization and equivalence query, applied to trained RNNs. The findings indicate that the quantization-based approach is both more stable and generally outperforms the equivalence query method. Additionally, the study reveals that the DFA extracted using O2RNN surpasses other RNN architectures in terms of performance and stability."

Alternatively, a clearer definition of stability in this context would also be helpful. In the current work, stability appears to be synonymous with the variance of performance.\n\n- A more thorough justification for the conclusion would be beneficial. Instead of solely benchmarking several methods across various settings, delving into the rationale behind the conclusions drawn would strengthen the paper and provide a more comprehensive perspective."

Results show that second-order RNNs like O2RNN have better stability in extracting DFAs than first-order ones like GRUs and LSTMs, validating prior theoretical work. The results also show that quantization-based approaches extract fewer states than equivalence query methods. In addition, this paper also contains many comparison analyses for the effects of different architecture hyperparams on rule extractions."

These results could in turn give some valuable feedback to the theoretical community, where the motivation of these questions is from.\n\nA possible potential for the approach investigated in this work is that it could serve as inspiration for the design of tasks to understand the capability of other types of neural networks that could potentially receive context-free language as inputs (say when context-free language is used to evaluate language models' ability)."

The way this paper motivates the reader, and how the background is introduced, is somewhat too narrowly focused such that only researchers working in the most vicinity of the DFA extraction area could appreciate it. \n2. Even though this paper aims to provide empirical validation of some prior theoretical results, its exposition of the theoretical background is a little incomplete and not well organized (for example, what is  $\\mathcal{E}_f$ and what's its relation with $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mathcal{E}^*(f)$? What does the subscript $|_i$ means in notation $\\mathcal{E}^*(f)|_i$?) I think the paper would benefit hugely from a rewriting of these sections, to fill the gap between rough discussions of prior works and actual mathematical backgrounds and the question this paper is tackling.\n3. The importance of the key evaluation metrics is not well motivated, and corresponding results are not well explained. For example, this paper should motivate more on why the number of extracted states can be used to evaluate DFA extraction strategies, and why lower numbers are preferred (yes the conclusion section contains better forms of your research questions but still why aren't they presented earlier?). \n4. The overall significance of the results in this paper is limited by the paper's choice to study only RNNs and rule extraction approaches, as they do not imply any further empirical messages, as the paper has not pointed to any other potential implications."
