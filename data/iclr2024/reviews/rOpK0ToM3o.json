While it's known that the performance of offline RL / imitation learning methods varies drastically depending on the data quality, it's important to evaluate the method on datasets of various optimality, and especially on those which are similar to real-world settings, e.g. the multi-human datasets from Robomimic. \n\nLastly, the proposed method seems sensitive (task depedent) to certain critical hyperparameters, including the \"action chunk size\". But experiments only cover a small range of those parameters. I believe more extensive ablation studies would be helpful to show if the method is robust and generally applicable to various continuous control problems."

What's your intuition on selecting an optimal range of N?\n\n5. As noted in the appendix, different weight functions f(x) were used in the Robomimic and FrankaKitchen experiments.

                "value": "While well-motivated, I have some major concerns about the methodology and experiments of this work:\n\n1. What value is $V_\\psi(s)$ modeling in value learning? According to Equation 5-9, it seems that $V_\\psi(s)$ is trying to approximate the value of the optimal single-step policy with the n-step Bellman equation. However, $V_\\psi(s)$ is proposed to model the value of arbitrary action frequencies or action lengths that should have different values, which is confusing to me.\n2. Compared to previous offline hierarchical RL works, what's the advantage of the proposed method? These works [1, 2, 3] also aim to solve similar tasks.\n3. I am worried that the experiments are insufficient to support that V-Former is a strong baseline for offline RL, as we can only see ablations of V-Former on action chunking and advantage weighting, missing the performance of other state-of-the-art offline RL and offline HRL baselines. Moreover, Section 5.3 shows that the optimal action chunk size is around 3 in Robomimic tasks, which makes it hard to distinguish the effect of temporally extended actions. Therefore, I suggest authors compare the performance of V-Former and other baselines on tasks that may benefit from longer horizon control, such as *antmaze* and *kitchen* in D4RL.\n\nMinor questions:\n\n1. How to choose the hyper-parameter N? It is unclear to me the criteria for choosing N in different environments during evaluation.\n2. The results in Section 5.1 and 5.3 indicate that open-loop control can achieve the best performance. However, Section 5.2 uses a close-loop VF for evaluation. Can authors provide some intuitions behind this choice?\n\nOverall, I am unable to recommend acceptance at this stage given the questions mentioned above. However, I would consider raising my score if the authors could address my concerns.\n\n[1] Pertsch, Karl, Youngwoon Lee, and Joseph Lim. \"Accelerating reinforcement learning with learned skill priors.\" Conference on robot learning.
