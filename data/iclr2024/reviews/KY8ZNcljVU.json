The NETINFOF_ACT component then uses this measured information to enhance the performance of graph tasks. The framework's robustness is tested on synthetic datasets designed to include various graph scenarios and validated on real-world datasets, showing superior results in link prediction tasks over standard GNN models. This paper's primary contribution is a method that can quickly assess a graph's usefulness for a task, offering a theoretical lower bound for accuracy without the computational overhead of model training\u200b.

Also, the adjustments of node similarity using compatibility matrix w/ negative edges is very interesting.\n- **Teoretical Foundation and Empirical Validation**: The paper provides a theoretical analysis for the NetInfoF_Score, presenting it as a lower bound for the accuracy of a GNN on a given task. This theoretical contribution is well-supported by empirical evidence on both synthetic datasets and real-life datasets.\n- **Scalability**: The demonstrated scalability of NetInfoF, especially its linear scaling with input size (Fig. 6), and the use of significantly fewer parameters compared to GAE methods (1280 vs 279k) demonstrates its potential for application in large-scale graph tasks, presenting a substantial advancement in the practical deployment of GNNs\u200b.

                "value": "1. The proof of Theorem 2 is problematic due to the incorrect use of conditional entropy. The proof incorrectly states the conditional entropy in Appendix A.2 as:\n$$\nH(Y|X) = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} p_i \\left(-\\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{ij} \\log_2 p_{ij}\\right),\n$$\nwhich is incorrect because it uses the joint probabilities $p_{ij}$ instead of the conditional probabilities. The correct expression for conditional entropy, which is based on the conditional probabilities, is:\n$$\nH(Y|X) = -\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{ij} \\log_2 P(Y=y_j|X=x_i),\n$$\nwhere $P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) = \\frac{p_{ij}}{p_i}$ is the conditional probability of $Y$ given $X=x_i$. And $p_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} p_{ij}$ represents the marginal probability of $X$ taking the value $x_i$. This definition adheres to the fundamental property that the conditional probabilities for a given $x_i$ should sum to 1, i.e., $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(Y=y_j|X=x_i) = 1$.\n\nThe misuse of conditional entropy in the proof leads to an erroneous application of Jensen's Inequality and subsequently invalidates the derived bound on the NetInfoF score.\n\n2. (Minor) Given the paper is mostly dealing with link prediction tasks. It will be beneficial to include some subgraph-based methods as baselines, such as SEAL [1]. I understand that NetInfoF is intended as an advancement beyond traditional GNN approaches, but including subgraph-based methods will give the community a more comprehensive evaluation of NetInfoF's capabilities. It's evident NetInfoF is way more scalable than subgraph-based methods, but subgraph-based methods are still SOTA on some datasets, e.g. Ogbl-collab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1] Zhang, Muhan, and Yixin Chen. \"Link prediction based on graph neural networks.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018)."
