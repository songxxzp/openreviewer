                "value": "The authors present a novel clustering framework motivated by strong clinical evidence that samples with negative labels are defined in an open-ended manner to highlight their potential to further understand the clinical outcome of interest. To achieve this, the authors i) use the data Shapley value to focus on a \"representative\" subset of negative samples and ii) enforce representation learning to preserve the interrelationship in data samples with respect to the computed Shapley value for clustering. The authors evaluate the proposed framework on a single private medical dataset with an extensive qualitative analysis to support the discovered clusters with domain knowledge. However, the evaluation is done only on a single private dataset and lacks a comparison with other clustering methods, including both traditional and cutting-edge methods. This limitation hinders the understanding of its broader impact."

Is there a chance that one of the identified clusters pertains to FN/FP cases?\n\n3. How is the clinical significance of these cohorts determined in section 4.2?\n\n4.

Of what value are the identified cohorts? If some are valuable because they are high risk or similar to positives (negative Shapley values), then isn't this equivalent to proximity to the decision boundary?
