                "value": "This submission tackles the case of high-dimensional optimization using Bayesian Optimization (BO), a sample-efficient method that has shown great success for hyperparameter tuning of large deep learning models, or in more concrete applications such as recommender systems tuning. It is therefore relevant for a venue such as ICLR, in my opinion. More particularly, the authors propose to tailor the so-called *group testing* theory to the BO setting. This is achieved by 1) extending group testing to real-valued functions and 2) dividing a usual BO run into two steps, a first step of relevant variable identification through group testing, and a second step of conventional BO, with the learned variable relevance being encoded in the Gaussian process surrogate lengthscales. The proposed method, *GTBO*, not only achieves state-of-the-art results of synthetic and real-world experiments but also enlights the practitioner with a ranking of the relevant variables, thus enhancing its understanding of the problem."

It performs in a sequential manner, where one first does not care about function maximization, only about variable relevance, even though finding out this information is costly, and then classical BO is performed.\nAs the group testing phase does not care about high function values, the design evaluated in this process can be associated with low function values. When this happens, the budget has been spent on a design that does not yield a high function value, and variable relevance is learned on a part of the space we do not really care about, as it does not yield a high function value.\nAny insights as to why *GTBO* seems to work despite that? Perhaps the initial starting points provided by group testing provide an accurate approximation of the function. A more relevant one than that usually obtained by uniform/Sobol sampling?\n\nSmall typo:\n\nI would write the r.h.s. of Eq. 4 as $H(Z_t) - H(Z_t|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = H(Z_t) - \\sum_{\\xi \\in \\{0,1\\}^D} p(\\xi)H(Z_t|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}=\\xi)$ instead of $H(Z_t) - H(Z_t|\\boldsymbol{\\xi}) = H(Z_t) - \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\xi} \\in \\{0,1\\}^D} p(\\xi)H(Z_t|\\boldsymbol{\\xi})$ (as is done in [1]).\n\n[1] Noisy Adaptive Group Testing using Bayesian Sequential Experimental Design, arXiv."

The algorithm explicitly divides high-dimensional BO into two steps: in the first, a set of group testing experiments are run to probabilistically identify inactive input dimensions. In the second, BO is run with a relatively standard method (Matern 5/2 with qLogNEI acquisition function), while applying different length-scale priors for active vs. inactive dimensions.\n\n------ AFTER AUTHOR RESPONSE -----\n\nThanks for these clarifications. I definitely misunderstood how the GT iterations were treated in the computational results, which the authors have pointed out. I have raised my Contribution and Overall scores to account for this mis-judging of the results.\n\nThere are still some points I believe could be improved--the authors also note both points in their response. Firstly, the presentation could focus on this as a feature selection method rather than a BO algorithm. It is a great feature that GTBO actively selects sampling points in contrast to \"traditional feature selection methods,\" but the entire GT step is still de-coupled from the latter BO step, unless I am mistaken here. Secondly, it would be nice to see some more realistic benchmark problem(s)."

Likewise, a different feature selection method could be followed by the employed BO, which is relatively standard.\n1. The motivation for the benchmark problems needs to be strengthened. The synthetic benchmarks have 2-8 active dimensions and approximately 300 active dimensions without justification for this setting. The real-world benchmarks have no noise, again without justification.\n1. From what I understand, the comparisons for GTBO do not include the 39-112 iterations for group testing, which are used as the initial sample points for BO. Therefore, in Figs 3-4, where the other algorithms are starting from 0 function evaluations, GTBO is already starting at many."
