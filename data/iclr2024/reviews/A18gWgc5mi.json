                "value": "Given a fully observable deterministic nonlinear dynamical system described by $dx/dt = f(x)$ such as Lotka-Voltera predator prey population models or chaotic pendulums, Koopman theory states there exists a mapping to a (typically much higher, possibly infinite, dimensional) space $z = g(x)$ where the dynamics are linear, fully described by $dz/dt = Kz$. (I am loosely reminded of the use of kernels in SVMs, a binary classification dataset where classes are not linearly separable can be mapped to a higher dimensional space where classes are linearly separable).\n\nThere is an active body of work using the Koopman framework where the mapping function $z = \\phi(x)$ is a learnable neural network trained with a corresponding inverse mapping $x = \\psi(z)$ which together form an encoder \u2013 decoder pair in an autoencoder architecture (albeit where latent $z$ dimension may be lower or higher than the data $x$ dimension), together with this autoencoder, the method learns the transition matrix across time in state latent space $z_{t+1} = K z_t$.\n\nFrom an initial datapoint $x_0$, time series prediction is performed by encoding the initial point $z_0=\\phi(x_0)$, applying the latent state transitions, $z_t = K^tz_0$, and decoding the latent states $x_t = \\psi(z_t)$. The authors state that this inference procedure can fail for long term prediction as latent to trajectories that do decode to a sequence of  \u201cdrifting\u201d datapoints. Prior works have proposed heuristic solutions such as training on long sequences and restricting the eigen values of the latent space transition matrix K. The authors propose an alternative heuristic they name \u201cperiodic re-encoding\u201d where, at every kth transition also incorporates a decoder \u2013 encoder pass, i.e. \n\n$z_{t+1} =$\n\n$ K\\phi(\\psi(z_t))$ if $t \\text{mod} k ==0$ \n\n$Kz_t \\quad \\quad \\quad$ otherwise\n\nThe authors perform experiments on simple well known NLDSs with and without periodic reencoding and make a strong case for the efficacy of periodic re-encoding. The authors apply the method to more challenging datasets from D4RL library and again demonstrate the improvement in performance as a result."

                "value": "For context in the follow up discussion, I would like to state my intuition of Koopman theory is that any finite dimensional nonlinear system can be \u201clifted\u201d into a higher dimensional space where dynamics are linear, in other words a complex low dimensional nonlinear transition function can be replaced with complex nonlinear high dimensional mapping and a simple transition function, we have just moved the \u201cnon-linearity-ness\u201d from one place to another and Koopman theory states that this is universally possible for any NLDS, although in practice this may be very difficult or even impossible in finite dimensions.\n\n## Major Points\n- If I understand correctly, when $dim(z) > dim(x)$, the data points encode to a $dim(x)$ manifold embedded in the z-space. One interpretation is that the re-encoding takes latent points that have drifted away from this from the latent data manifold and puts them back on. However, if this were the case, re-encoding every step would have the best results.\n- I struggle to agree with the conclusions drawn by the example given in Appendix C.  I view Appendix C as a special case of failure to specify good mappings. The claim that periodic reencoding solves the problem I find strange. If I understand correctly, the perturbations introduced by the decoder-encoder pass allow the latent state to jump between basins of attraction of each fixed point? Presumably these perturbations are just noise and an artefact of the (arbitrary) precision achieved by model training convergence.\n- what is the benefit of periodic re-encoding, clamping latent representations to the data manifold or adding noisy perturbations?\n- the authors include non-linear transitions as a baseline, while it is nice to have more baselines, as I understand, linear transitions is the only reason to use Koopman theory. As expected, the (strictly higher capacity) non-linear transition outperform the liner transitions.\n- Given the re-encoding is not specific to Koopman, and that Koopman (linear) transitions predictably perform worse than non-linear transitions, this paper\u2019s focus on the Koopman framework seems unnecessary.\n- there are many many autoencoder + latent space transition models that vary mainly by application specific architectural differences (e.g. pixels/graph/vectors require CNN/GCN/MLP encoder) and their training losses (L2, ELBO, Cross entropy etc), and a quick google for \"latent dynamics\" and \"deep kalman\" yields many results, many that have linear latent transitions\n  - https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/7b7a53e239400a13bd6be6c91c4f6c4e-Abstract.html\n  - http://www.approximateinference.org/2015/accepted/KrishnanEtAl2015.pdf\n  - https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04551\n\n\n\n## Minor Points\n- Section 2, first paragraph does not help unfamiliar people understand Koopman theory or MDM (and familiar people do not need to be told). I would suggest dumbing this down as the level of Koopman theory required for this paper can be explained very easily.\n- Bibliography: many of the references have titles, names and dates but are missing journal/conference information\n- Appendix E is a nice addition, yet it feels somewhat arbitrary to cite a handful or RNN papers when the time series modelling literature is vast and the autoencoder + latent dynamics literature is I feel is more closely related this work than RNNs."

                "value": "The authors of the study investigated the use of Koopman autoencoders to model complex, nonlinear dynamical systems. They explored different approaches for making long-term predictions and showed that generating predictions solely within the latent space had two potential challenges: 1) It was unable to effectively capture the behavior of multi-stable systems that switch between multiple fixed points. 2) It violated the existence and uniqueness theorem of initial value problems, which establishes the uniqueness of solutions in dynamical systems. To address these challenges, the authors introduced a technique called \"periodic reencoding.\" This method strikes a balance between not using reencoding at all and reencoding at every step, and it was found to yield the best practical results in their experiments."

                "value": "**A minor point**:  Regarding the sentence \"This characteristic becomes especially significant when the dimensionality of the latent space is substantially larger than that of the original space, i.e., n >> d, ...\", why is this case considered more important? While it's true that a mapping to a larger dimensional space is not surjective, as discussed in the paper, it seems that the lack of injectivity of the map is more critical. So, since a mapping to a smaller dimensional space is not injective, wouldn't the case of n << d be more problematic?\n\n**A few questions**:\n\n1. When it comes to learning chaotic dynamics, what are the advancements offered by the proposed method compared to using RNNs with teacher forcing, as presented in the following papers?  \n\n[1] F. Hess, Z. Monfared, M. Brenner, D. Durstewitz, Generalized Teacher Forcing for Learning Chaotic \nDynamics, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (ICML 2023), (2023). \n\n[2] J. Mikhaeil, Z. Monfared, D. Durstewitz, On the difficulty of learning chaotic dynamics with RNNs, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), (2022).\n\n2. Regarding eq. (9), it apears that the Jacobian $J_{\\psi}$  of  $\\psi$ is assumed to be a constant matrix. If this is the case, how can one ensure that it remains a fixed matrix? It may vary depending on the specific points at which it is calculated and could differ across different points.\n\n3. How effectively would the proposed method perform in capturing the dynamics of a multi-stable system with a stable fixed point and a periodic attractor, or possibly with two periodic attractors?\n\n4. How changes in the hyperparameters $\\Delta t$ or $k$ can impact the results? Does an optimal value always exist for that?\n\n5. Why do the authors use an MLP instead of K (e.g., on page 6)? How does the choice of activation function affect the performance of the MLP? Were other activation functions considered, and if so, how did they compare to the chosen function? Can the MLP be replaced with other types of neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks or recurrent neural networks? How would this affect the performance of the proposed framework?\n\nI am happy to increase my score if the authors could address my concerns."
