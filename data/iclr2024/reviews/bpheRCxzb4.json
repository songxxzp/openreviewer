                "value": "This paper presents a framework for evaluating textual explanations (rationale and free-text rationale).\n\nBut I still have several questions about this paper.\n\n1. The authors use the method of mutual information to assess the information of two text explanations, which is a common and intuitive practice. My confusion lies in how the authors estimate this mutual information. As far as I understand, using InfoNCE to estimate mutual information should require training. What is the training data? What is the training process?\n\n\n2. I notice that the authors have compared several mutual information estimators in the appendix, such as club, smile, InfoNCE. Here I still have questions about the club method. According to the paper of club, the value estimated by club should be higher than the real mutual information, and thus it should be higher than the value estimated by InfoNCE, how do the authors judge that the value estimated by InfoNCE is more accurate?\n\n\n3. Why use V-information instead of the traditional mutual information method?\n\n4. Does this method depend on the accuracy of the mutual information estimator? What are its advantages over other evaluation methods (e.g., traditional metrics for evaluating NLE (rouge))?\n\n5. In summary, I think this paper has limited innovation and usefulness.\n\nFinally, for ICLR submissions, the appendix could be placed after the main text, not separately in the supplementary material."

The authors have pointed to Appendix A.5, but it could be better to point to Figure7. Also, I would suggest this statistics be moved to the main content.\n  * In section 5.1: How do the authors compute the statistics \u201cThe reasoning category scores can explain 16% and 21% of the variance in the estimated I(Y ; E) for OpenAI and RoBERTa on NLE (18% and 19% for rationale), and no more than 15% for any other categories.\u201d?\n  * In section 5.2: The authors do not put any reference to statistics in this section. I guess the authors are referring to Figure 4, 5, and 6. I would also suggest Figures 5 and 6 be moved to the main content. To comprise the paper space, I would think that prompt templates and discussion about multimodal can be moved to appendix.\n* I would suggest changing the naming of \u201cinformativeness\u201d in the GPTScore evaluation items. This term is the same as the proposed \u201cinformativeness score I(Y;E)\u201d, so can cause confusion.\n* Why is there no \u201cinformativeness\u201d from Table1 in Figure3\u2019s x-axis?\n* I would suggest changing the order of x-axis in Figure3 to match the order of them in Table1."
