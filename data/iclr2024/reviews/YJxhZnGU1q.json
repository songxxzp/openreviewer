First, this paper defines the manipulative potential of a recommender and proves that it increases with the number of states, i.e., the possible kind of recommendations. Next, this paper proposes an algorithm for recommendation and empirically shows the effectiveness of this recommender by well-known Braess's paradox instance."

In such a case, explicitly maintaining all the actions is prohibitive since the number of actions is generally exponentially large with respect to the number of shared resources. I think for some sets of actions (like path-sets of selfish routing setting), it may be possible to alleviate this issue because some computational components fall into easy problem like shortest-path problem; this is true for the equilibrium computation of congestion games. Do you have any idea for improving the time complexity of the proposed algorithm under such a situation where the set of actions is paths?"

As a result, my initial belief would be to reject; that said, I could be convinced by the authors or the other reviewers to raise my score.\n\nComments/Questions\n\n---Was $\\varepsilon$-greedy Q-learning ever defined? My understanding was that this means that each agent uniformly explores with probability $\\varepsilon$; if so, how does this connect with Assumption 1?\n\n---What is the intuition behind the objective function of the RS in equation (2) in terms of KL divergence? Wouldn't a more natural objective be to minimize the weighted congestion of the actions of the Q-learners?\n\n---Regarding Assumption 1: should there be a $t$ dependence somewhere here? If so, is that meant to hold for all $t$?\n\n---It might be useful to provide pseudocode for the subroutines in Algorithm 1, at least in the Appendix.\n\n---I had significant difficulty parsing the statement and content of Theorems 1 and 2. In Theorem 1, what does it mean that \"the manipulative potential for every timestep $t$ is maximized\"? The proof itself seems to use ``infinity'' in somewhat unclear ways that made it hard to understand. I also had issues determining a precise way to formalize the statement of Theorem 2. For both results, it might be very useful to give a more formal statement and proof to make clear what is meant.\n\n---What is the (empirical or theoretical) computational cost of the heuristic algorithm, especially on generalizations to larger network topologies?\n\n---My impression is that the empirical performance of the heuristic algorithm is quite interesting. But as mentioned above, my main concern is that these experiments seem to have only been done in the Braess paradox network and not on more general topologies."

What is the state S here? And is a player allowed to observe other players' actions or rewards? It is beneficial to add a detailed description of players' Q-learning policy.\n\n3. could you give an intuitive explanation why Q-learning agents can escape from the low-welfare NE of the Braess Paradox game even without the help of recommendations? I wish I could get some takeaway insight in this section but unfortunately the discussion is too little. \n\n4. In terms of the better social outcome result, it is known that the for smooth games (including the class of congestion games), the PoA under NE is essentially the same as the PoA under CE/CCE [1]. So I suppose in general, the social welfare improvement from steering the NE to CE in congestion games can be very little. Do you agree with this argument? \n\n5. there are some related works, e.g., [2,3] regarding mechanism designs for content recommendation platform, which also involves dynamical optimization over a congestion game structure.
