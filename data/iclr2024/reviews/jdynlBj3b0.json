The authors present a class-priors estimation technique that aims to align the estimated class-priors with the actual class-priors as training progresses. In addition, an unbiased risk assessment tool is introduced, which is based on the estimated class-priors, and a generalization error bound is provided. Testing on ten MLL benchmark datasets has been conducted to evaluate the performance of this method in comparison to other SPMLL techniques."

Additionally, it claims that the risk minimizer corresponding to the proposed risk estimator will approximately converge to the optimal risk minimizer on fully supervised data. These theoretical insights enhance the credibility of the proposed framework.\n\nWithin the group of other SPMLL techniques experimental results are quite favorable both in terms of average precision as well as predicting the class prior. Attention maps also look quite promising."

Yet, the rationale for opting for the \"single-positive\" label remains somewhat vague. In real-life situations, it's common to encounter missing labels, but the count of observed labels for each sample can differ, not always being restricted to one. For this study to truly make a difference, it should be benchmarked not just against other SPMLL strategies but also against traditional multi-label learning models that consider multiple positive labels for each sample during training (not just testing). The assumption that each sample contains precisely one positive label for training seems out of sync with practical scenarios. \n\nThe paper should discuss the potential limitations or challenges in generalizing CRISP to different domains or types of data. Real-world scenarios can vary widely, and the effectiveness of the proposed framework in diverse contexts should be explored."
