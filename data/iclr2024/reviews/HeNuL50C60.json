This task is challenging yet practical. To this end, this paper explores a classic and widely-used approach, Generalizable Reweighting (GRW), which iteratively reweightes the training samples to improve generalization performance. This paper gives sufficient theoretical analysis. And experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

                "value": "1. The motivation of this paper is somewhat unclear. In the first paragraph of Introduction Section, the authors introduce the task of single-domain generalized object detection. However, the second paragraph directly indicates that generalizable reweighting is a classical yet effective technique. To the best of my knowledge, there exist some works for S-DGOD. The authors should sufficiently introduce these works and analyze their corresponding problems, which is beneficial for further understanding the motivation of this paper.\n\n2. To the best of my knowledge, there exists a type of technique that aims to utilize active learning to improve the generalization ability of models. I am not clear about the difference between active learning and generalizable reweighting. The authors should give more interpretations.\n\n3. In Eq. (5) and (6), directly adding Gaussian perturbation to the extracted feature may destroy the semantic information, as it is hard to control the perturbation degree. Besides, the authors introduce a penalty term based on the variance of batch-wise loss. However, computing batch-wise loss may introduce additional computational costs. The authors should give more interpretations and analysis.\n\n4. In Fig. 3, the shown images only contain one object, i.e., car, which is somewhat simple. The authors should show more different examples containing multiple objects. Besides, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new loss function. However, this paper does not show the optimization details. The authors should show training curves. Finally, it is better to show failure detection results and give corresponding interpretations, which is helpful for understanding the proposed method."
