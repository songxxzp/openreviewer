What do the PCA and t-SNE result look like for the model without the KL divergence? \n\n- How does the proposed approach work in comparison to predictor-based QAS algorithms?\n\n- It seems that quantum circuits with a greater depth are more likely to suffer from the Barren Plateau problem.

From my observations of the circuits displayed in Figure 3, it seems that having more parameters on each qubit and having several entangling generating gates to forge entanglement among the qubits are the key to the performance of the circuit and is also the key feature in the latent representation learning. I wonder if there are other features that are essential, and whether they can be captured by the graph representation of the circuit.\n\nThe evaluation of the search procedure is also limited. Only three methods are compared. I keep wondering what are the good design principles for the methods of quantum architecture search. \n\nSome minor points:\n* Why in the gate matrix representation in Figure 2, CNOT gate is not directed? I.e., the order of q1 and q2 matters for the gate.\n* The notations around (2) are inconsistent. MLP^(s) and MLP(M^(S)) seem to be the same thing.\n* The naming of \u201cfidelity of quantum states\u201d is not conventional. It\u2019s better to use the name \u201cstate preparation\u201d.\n* The details in the training of the GINs learning of circuit representations are missing in the appendix."
