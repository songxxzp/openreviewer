In IEEE S&P, 2019.\n\n* (Claimed contribution 2) The general idea of first decoupling backdoor features from benign ones and then performing trigger inversion on backdoor features is the same as in [2] (though the formulation of the optimization problem is different).\n\n[2] Liu et al, ABS: Scanning Neural Networks for Back-doors by Artificial Brain Stimulation. CCS, 2019.\n\n* (Claimed contribution 1) \"Revealing the low efficiency and low similarity nature of existing backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) methods and their intrinsic reason\" cannot be regarded as a contribution even though you show your method performs better. Besides, there is no adequate discussion about the \"intrinsic reason\" in this paper.\n\n* The motivation of this work is weak.\n\nWhat is the motivation for proposing this trigger inversion approach? If the purpose is for better backdoor detection, there is no detection performance demonstrated in the paper. If it is for better backdoor mitigation, there is no evidence that the trigger inverted by other baselines cannot mitigate the backdoor. Moreover, intuitively, inaccurately estimated triggers will introduce more robustness to backdoor unlearning. For example, if the trigger is a 3 by 3 yellow square, unlearning using yellow squares with different shapes and sizes will be more effective than unlearning the backdoor using the exact 3 by 3 square only.\n\n* The results in Table 1 need to be double-checked.\n\nFor example, the DSR for Unicorn is much lower than the original paper [3].\n\n[3] Wang et al, Unicorn: A unified backdoor trigger inversion framework. In ICLR, 2023.\n\n* The intuition behind the proposed method does not always hold.\n\nThe proposed trigger inversion method can be defeated when there is no decoupling between benign and backdoor features. This happens when the model is compact and when the trigger is globally wide. For example, the \"chessboard\" trigger that cannot be mitigated by the method in [4] does not satisfy the decoupling assumption.\n\n[4] Wang et al, MM-BD: Post-Training Detection of Backdoor Attacks with Arbitrary Backdoor Pattern Types Using a Maximum Margin Statistic, In IEEE S&P, 2024.\n\n* Insufficient evaluation of the decoupling method.\n\nIf the decoupling method works for the proposed formulation for trigger inversion, it should also work for other formulations such as Unicorn. It is important to show that such decoupling is generalizable.\n\n* No evaluation of efficiency in the main paper.\n\nTo show that the proposed method is reliable and efficient, it is necessary to include a quantitative comparison of computational overhead in the main paper."

This two-step method not only enhances the efficiency by obviating the need to scan all classes for potential target labels but also improves detection accuracy.\n\nThe paper's methodology encompasses minimizing the disparities between benign samples and their generated poisoned counterparts in the benign feature space, while maximizing differences in the backdoor features. \n\nThis approach also lays the groundwork for more effective backdoor-removal and pre-processing-based defenses. \nThe effectiveness of this new method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating backdoor threats, showcasing a significant advancement."
