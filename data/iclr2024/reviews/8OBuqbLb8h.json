                "value": "This paper proposes efficient pretraining with ELECTRA by using a fixed generator (auxiliary model) instead of training the aux model together with the discriminator for replace token detection (RTD). In order to simulate a curriculum of difficulty that training of aux model provides, it uses an exponentially decaying schedule on the *temperature* used to sample from aux model.\n\nEfficiency: Since the aux model is fixed, Fast-ELECTRA saves on backward passes leading to overall 20-30% FLOPs per step. (This calculation ignores original training of the auxiliary model.) It also saves 20-25% memory in the aux model. One could also cache the aux model predictions and save a lot more FLOPs (30-40%).\n\nQuality: Fast-ELECTRA is competitive with many BERT and ELECTRA related baselines, even slightly better on some GLUE downstream evals\n\nRobustness: The paper evaluates robustness to curriculum schedule and discriminator model size, and finds that Fast-ELECTRA behaves more gracefully compared to ELECTRA and can handle higher learning rates.\n\nThe paper also performs interesting ablation studies with using some simple aux models and different (linear/poly) schedules for curriculum. Overall, the paper presents a conceptually interesting finding that that a fixed pretrained aux model can be used, with a temperature schedule. Incomplete comparisons to earlier ideas made it harder to judge novelty"

                "value": "Comparison to prior work: \n\n- It would be helpful to highlight the most relevant work in Table 1 that a reader should focus in. Additionally, is there any evaluation on prior work that uses fixed generator? It would also help to include some FLOPs comparison to the baselines used in Table 1. The paper will also help with a discussion on accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Lack of such discussions made it harder to assess the full value of proposed method.\n\n- Recent paper (Dong et al.) from ICML 2023 proposed a different strategy of decoupling generator and discriminator optimizers and has better GLUE metrics than Fast-ELECTRA. This does not dilute the contributions of this paper much because Fast-ELECTRA also leads to training speed up, and is conceptually different. However it will be helpful to include and compare to this method. It could be an interesting open question if the gap to Dong et al. can be reduced with a fixed aux model.\n\n\nMissing discussions: Most of the paper assumes the existence of a good pretrained aux model, but ignores the cost of training the aux model itself. Does Fast-ELECTRA truly reduce total FLOPs in that case?\n\n\nOverall I believe that the paper makes a positive contribution. I'm currently assigning a score of weak accept mainly due to above reservations about comparisons to prior work.\n\nDong et al.
