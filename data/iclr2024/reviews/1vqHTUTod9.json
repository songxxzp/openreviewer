                "value": "==*== Paper summary\n\nThis paper discusses the impact of large multimodal language models in various applications and the privacy and security concerns associated with their use. These models have been observed to memorize and unintentionally disclose pre-training data, posing significant privacy risks. The paper introduces PRIVQA, a multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the trade-off between privacy protection and model utility. PRIVQA simulates scenarios where models are instructed to safeguard specific categories of personal information. The evaluation on PRIVQA assesses how well access control instructions can prevent models from leaking protected personal data. The paper also presents a method for iteratively moderating model responses, enhancing privacy. However, the study reveals that adversaries can easily bypass these protections through simple jailbreaking techniques using text or image inputs. The authors suggest that PRIVQA can aid in the development of improved privacy protection in models and enhance their resilience against adversarial attacks."

                "value": "==*== Comments for author\n\nQ1: In Figure 9, the authors present an illustrative case to expound upon the privacy-utility trade-off inherent in the current GPT-4 model, particularly with respect to its handling of location information. Evidently, the showcased examples elucidate the inadvertent disclosure of image location data by GPT-4. Nevertheless, a pertinent query arises as to whether GPT-4 would also inadvertently divulge location information in the case of images depicting unfamiliar landmarks or attractions. To address this question comprehensively, it is imperative to consider the pervasive practice of mobile devices embedding geospatial data within the photographs they capture. In the event that an adversarial agent can effectively employ tailored adversarial prompts to prompt GPT-4 to discern the geographic origin of such photographs, it would substantially enhance the persuasiveness of the assertion.\n\nQ2: More baselines still need to be added to illustrate the superiority of the proposed self-moderation technology. Indeed, the reviewer knows that the main contribution of this paper is not the designed self-moderation technology, but it would be better if existing privacy protection technologies could be more comprehensively explored to illustrate the privacy concerns of existing multi-modal large language models. For instance, it would be judicious to incorporate emerging data right-to-forget protection technologies, such as machine unlearning, as a baseline reference. By doing so, the authors can provide a more robust and convincing assessment of the available privacy-preserving techniques within the context of multi-modal large language models.\n\nQ3: The reviewers acknowledge that the PRIVQA benchmark data set proposed in this paper already includes a variety of privacy attribute information. I might expect that the benchmark data set could include more sensitive private information such as race, occupation, address, bank account, etc.\n\nQ4: To be candid, I find myself in a somewhat uncertain position regarding the alignment of the proposed benchmark dataset with the prevailing perspectives within the ICLR community. There exists a degree of ambiguity concerning whether the technical intricacies involved in dataset creation adequately conform to the community's overarching scope and the stipulated requirements for paper submissions. It may be prudent to consider that the NeurIPS dataset track could potentially represent a more suitable forum for the presentation and evaluation of this dataset, given its specific focus and expertise in dataset-related matters."

Privacy is about preventing the worst-case scenarios, not the average ones. Therefore, privacy metrics should reflect that even a single leak of private data is unacceptable. For example, in differential privacy, \u03b4 is set to a very small value or in membership inference attacks, TPR is reported at very low FPR.

The tasks are defined both for open-ended generation and for visualQA. The desired behavior is that if the model is asked a question regarding a sensitive topic, it abstains from answering, but answers utility related questions.

It seems like the authors are targeting training data, however, according to existing extraction attacks [1], this is not a realistic scenario and not a real problem. There is no successful extraction attack that would so easily, from an instruction tuned model, extract any information that is not repeated many many times. The questions work in this dataset, since the authors target celebrities. So I think trying to protect training data here is not really sensible. The inference data, that would make more sense, which seems to be the case in the visual part of the paper? But then, in that case, what is a realistic scenario? In general it is very unclear what is happening here.\n\n2. The dataset is not curated in a principled way and is too artificial. There are no levels to what is being protected, and how it needs protection. The attributes are artificially inserted.\n\n3. I think the authors need to first discuss the related work better: talk about existing membership inference and extraction attacks, about the risks, and then about differential privacy and other protection methods, and then position the paper with regards to all that.\n\n[1] Carlini N, Ippolito D, Jagielski M, Lee K, Tramer F, Zhang C.

It seems this paper just directly applies the previous red teaming methods for an empirical study and do not propose any new read teaming method.\n4. The connection between the read teaming part in Section 5 and privacy experiments in Section 4 is unclear. Can I also regard the privacy experiments in Section 4 as \u201cread teaming\u201d? Because the authors define \u201cRed teaming has become a standard method to elicit and evaluate privacy, security, and bias concerns with language models\u201d in Section 5. Based on my understanding, the privacy experiments in Section 4 are also \u201cread teaming\u201d. It is unclear why the authors define \u201cread teaming\u201d in Section 5 again. The content in Section 4 & Section 5 is overlapped.\n5. This paper does not discuss any effective ways to protect privacy. Although this paper conduct an assessment on LMMs to follow instructions to protect personal information. The proposed Self-Moderation strategy seems to be not very effective.
