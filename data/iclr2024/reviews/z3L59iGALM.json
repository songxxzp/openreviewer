                "value": "This paper addresses the problem of route optimization. Given a set of demonstrations of chosen navigation routes that optimize a set of unknown preferences (e.g., concerning distance, traffic, pollution), the goal is to learn a model such that suitable routes can be suggested for (possibly unseen) route-destination pairs. The authors address this problem with inverse reinforcement learning, in which the goal is to learn the reward function underlying these preferences. Equipped with the reward function, routes can be suggested e.g. via finding the highest cumulative reward path between the source and destination.\n\nThe authors present a set of improvements over standard IRL algorithms, concerning an improved initialization of the MaxEnt algorithm,  learning separate reward functions per geographical region, and trading off between expensive stochastic rollouts and cheaper deterministic planners. The method is evaluated on a global dataset of routes in several cities, showing that the method compares favorably with other IRL algorithms.\n\n## Post-response update\nI am updating the score to 6 as a result of the discussion. I think the benefits of publishing the findings of this work outweigh the shortcomings."

For instance, Adversarial IRL [1] and IQ-Learn [2], value DICE [3] are well-known recent IRL algorithms that are much more scalable. Therefore, it is crucial to focus on these algorithms instead of the outdated MaxEnt.\n\n[1] Fu, Justin, Katie Luo, and Sergey Levine. \"Learning robust rewards with adversarial inverse reinforcement learning.\" ICLR 2018. \n\n[2] Garg, Divyansh, Shuvam Chakraborty, Chris Cundy, Jiaming Song, and Stefano Ermon. \"IQ-Learn: Inverse Soft-Q Learning for Imitation.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 4028-4039.\n\n[3] Kostrikov, Ilya, Ofir Nachum, and Jonathan Tompson. \"Imitation learning via off-policy distribution matching.\" ICLR 2019\n\nI notice that the related work section exclusively references older papers and appears to be outdated. It would be beneficial for the authors to give greater consideration to more recent developments in the field of IRL/imitation learning.\n\nThis should be noted that the routing task is deterministic, so both online and offline IRL/imitation learning algorithm can be applied.

The application scenario is a popular route recommendation platform that should be able to generalize globally. Given a dataset of expert trajectories, in this approach, a reward function is learned from these demonstrations and this reward then guides an action selection policy from the start state to the destination. \n\nBuilding on prior work in IRL, particularly MaxEnt IRL, the authors propose an initialization strategy that leads to faster convergence, called MaxEnt++. Next, they generalize these and other IRL algorithms in their proposed framework called RHIP (Receding Horizon Inverse Planning) that trades-off using an expensive stochastic policy upto a horizon H with a cheap deterministic planner afterwards. Additionally, a number of parallelized computation and graph compression techniques are implemented to further improve the scalability of their algorithm for the application setting. Experiments on held-out validation trajectories show the superior performance of their method compared to prior work in IRL for quality route recommendations."
