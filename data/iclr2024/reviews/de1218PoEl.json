DumBO relaxes the additivity constraints of traditional BO algorithms for high-dimensional inputs. It achieves better performance against some existing BO algorithms, especially when the additive structure of the objective function comprises high-dimensional factors. DumBO finds the maximum of the objective function while ensuring consistency between shared input components. The algorithm relies on ADMM to maximize the acquisition function and has demonstrated good performance in the numerical experiments."

For example, the main assumption of this work is that the objective function $f$ can be decomposed into several factors and each factor only takes some dimensions of $\\boldsymbol{x}$ as the input, as in Equation (2). However, this decomposition is not explicitly explained in Section 3.1. Actually, Figure 2 in the supplements helps the audience to understand and can be moved to the main text. In addition, to guarantee the performance of ADMM, the authors assume that the acquisition function ``is a restricted prox-regular function that satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz condition\u2019\u2019. The authors should at least provide a formal definition of this condition.\n\nThe theoretical results do not exhibit sufficient novelty. For example, similar results as Theorem 3.4 have been derived, for example, in [1]. The analysis of the regret is also quite similar to that in [2], without significant novelty. \n\nReferences:\n[1] Mutny, Mojmir, and Andreas Krause. \"No-regret algorithms for capturing events in Poisson point processes.\" In International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 7894-7904.

The authors might discuss under what conditions the acquisition function satisfies Assumption 5.1.\n\nBesides, the authors might provide a more detailed comparison with the existing algorithm Add-GP-UCB [3], since the decomposition of the objective function is quite similar."
