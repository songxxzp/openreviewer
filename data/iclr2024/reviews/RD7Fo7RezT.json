This paper proposes Vid2Act, which learns to transfer potentially useful dynamics and action demonstrations from various offline datasets to a novel task.  Vid2Act build a time-varying, task-selective distillation loss to generate a set of offline-to-online similarity weights to adaptively transfer the task-agnostic knowledge of physical dynamics and replay relevant source actions. Experiments on the Meta-World and DeepMind Control Suite demonstrates the advantage of Vid2Act."

As a result, it becomes fundamentally impossible to scale up this approach to the scenarios where the number of pretraining tasks is large (Metaworld-45 or the more recent LIBERO benchmark).\n\nThe empirical evaluation is also problematic, with the choice of tasks being too simple (metaworld) or too few (deepmind control suite). More tasks and harder tasks, more environment interaction steps, more baselines, and more random seeds (although this is minor) are needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nAdditionally, many relevant works are missing in the paper."

            "questions": {
                "value": "### 1. Questions about task similarity weights calculation\n**(a)** For calculating the task similarity score, why having a distillation layer \\( f_\\text{distill} \\), why cannot we just directly take \\( \\|e_t - s_t^i\\| \\)? The role of \\( f_\\text{distill} \\) and \\( f_\\text{weight} \\) is very unclear even though the authors are trying to explain in the text.\n\n**(b)** Why not a simpler approach such as [7]? We could calculate the task similarity by simply looking at the similarity of their gradients. This should serve as a baseline to substitute the proposed architecture here if the authors want to claim that learning \\( f_\\text{distill} \\) and \\( f_\\text{weight} \\) gives a better solution.\n\n### 2. Clarification of Terms\nWhat is \\( G_\\theta(e_t, k) \\) in equation (8)? The author only mentions that \\( G_\\theta \\) consists of the encoder \\( E_{\\theta_1} \\) and decoder \\( D_{\\theta_2} \\), and what \\( E_{\\theta_1} \\) and \\( D_{\\theta_2} \\) are in (6) and (7).\n\n### 3. Handling Different Action Spaces\nIt is not clear to me how the proposed method handles different action space dimensionalities in DMC tasks.\n\n### 4. Task Selection\n- **(MetaWorld):** The six tasks from Metaworld are all too simple. The authors should consider more challenging tasks such as Hand Insert, Stick Pull, Stick Push, Disassembly, Assembly, Shelf Place, and so on. Please refer to [1] for a rough categorization of the difficulty of tasks in MetaWorld.\n- **(DMC):** Only two tasks during downstream finetuning are considered (Quadruped Walk and Quadruped Run). More medium-difficulty tasks in DMC should be considered. Please refer to [3] for a list of medium-difficulty tasks. Additionally, a few harder humanoid tasks would be good to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pretraining approach.\n\n### 5. Number of Environment Steps\nFor DMC, 400K environment timesteps are far too few to draw a conclusion. With only 400K steps, the performance of all methods on Quadruped Run and Quadruped Walk is poor (<350 compared to 800-900 of the convergent performance). For Metaworld, the authors use 200K, but it is mostly that the selected tasks are too easy.\n\n### 6. Baselines\n**(a)** [1] and [8] are both model-based approaches for visual RL that should serve as baselines. Maybe [1] is more relevant since it\u2019s dreamer-based, but at least [8] should be mentioned in the paper.\n**(b)** Dreamer-v3 [2]: the author should compare with the latest dreamer model.\n**(c)** Model-free approaches [3,4,5]: model-free visual RL algorithms should also be good baselines. ([3,4,5] are missing from the related works of the paper.) If after pretraining latent dynamics from multitask offline datasets, it still does not perform as well as the model-free visual RL approach from scratch, then the pretraining would be of no value.\n\n### 7. More Random seeds\n(Minor point): More random seeds are needed for the empirical evaluation. Right now Vid2Act only runs 3 random seeds.\n\n### 8. Missing Related Works\n[6] is a latent model-based transfer RL approach that should also be discussed in the related work section.\n\n\n### References\n- [1] Younggyo Seo, Danijar Hafner, Hao Liu, Fangchen Liu, Stephen James, Kimin Lee, Pieter Abbeel, \"Masked World Models for Visual Control,\" CoRL 2022.\n- [2] Danijar Hafner, Jurgis Pasukonis, Jimmy Ba, and Timothy Lillicrap, \"Mastering Diverse Domains through World Models,\" Arxiv Preprint.\n- [3] Denis Yarats, Rob Fergus, Alessandro Lazaric, Lerrel Pinto, \"Mastering Visual Continuous Control: Improved Data-Augmented Reinforcement Learning,\" ICLR 2021.\n- [4] Edoardo Cetin, Philip J.

This work considers the problem of transferring models trained on offline datasets of observation-action pairs (no rewards) for a number of source tasks to a new target task for which we have access to a reward function. The proposed framework, dubbed Vid2Act, trains task-specific world models for individual source tasks, and then leverage the learned models during the transfer stage in which a new model is learned from scratch on the new task using online RL. Specifically, the source models are used to distill knowledge into the new student model, weighted by their relevance to the target task. Additionally, Vid2Act also uses a novel *generative replay* where the behavior policy for the target task is additionally provided with the embedding of an action generation model trained on source data. Experiments are conducted on visual DMControl + Meta-World tasks in an offline-to-online setting, and the proposed method is consistently on par or better than (seemingly) strong baselines."

However, I'd also like the authors to clarify the following:\n- In the case of the DMControl experiments, the authors only consider target tasks using the Quadruped embodiment which is not included in the offline dataset. Why did the authors choose these particular tasks for transfer? What would the results look like for a transfer setting in which the target task is a seen embodiment but unseen task? Intuitively, I would expect transfer to be most effective in this setting, since the dynamics are exactly the same -- only the task (reward function) is new. The Meta-World experiments don't quite cover this setting since objects and thus dynamics differ even though it is the same robot.\n- Code is provided as supplementary material. Are the authors committed to open-sourcing their code in case of acceptance?"
