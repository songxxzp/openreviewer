                "value": "The paper proposes to revisit the standard uniform square tokenization in vision transformers, and instead replace it with **superpixel-based tokenization**. The superpixel partition follows the methodology of \"SuperPixel Hierarchy\" (Wei et al, Transactions on Image Processing 2018) with an additional regularization term for self-loop edges. Based on this criterion, pixels are grouped hierarchically to form superpixels, and the number of hierarchy levels is chosen to obtain a comparable number of tokens to `ViT-B/16`.\nOnce the superpixels are defined, several sets of features are extract for each of them to form the input token representations:\n  * **positional encodings** are computed as a histogram over the spatial positions present in the superpixel\n  * **texture features** are extracted using gradient operators\n  * **color features** are computed by interpolating the light intensity information present in the suerpixel\n\nOnce the superpixel and corresponding features are defined, the rest of the model is defined as a standard transformer architectures. In practice, the paper uses **ViT (Small and Base)** as backbone. The proposed method is evaluated on the task of image classification, as well as through various explainability metrics. It is compared to the backbone (ViT), as well to a method employing random Voronoi cells as tokens. The results show that the proposed method can match classification accuracy of the standard ViT backbone while yielding more interpretable feature attribution maps."

            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Practicality of superpixels**: One advantage of square tokenization is that it is highly practical:, it's a simple patching operation, and the position encodings can easily be transferred across scales using interpolation (see for instance \"*FlexiViT: One Model for All Patch Sizes, Beyer et al, CVPR 2023*\"). In contrast, the proposed method requires the extra step of generating superpixels for each input image, which is not discussed in the paper\n\n- **Limited baselines:** The paper primarly evaluates three methods: `ViT-{S,B}/16` (the base model), `SPiT-{S, B}/16` (the proposed model) and `RViT-{S,B}/16`, which, from my understanding, is a baseline introduced in this paper using random Voronoi cells as tokens. I understand that improving classification accuracy is not the main goal of the paper hence the choice of baselines, but I do still think the paper would benefit from comparing to baselines which have a similar goal (i.e. either methods that propose more flexible tokenization, or more interpretable attention maps)\n\n- **Missing related work:** In general, the discussion of related work in the paper is very short and does not seem to contextualize the paper enough. For instance, some points which may be interesting to discuss:\n  * On the aspect of interpretability, models such as `DINO` trained with finer-grained tokens (*Emerging Properties in Self-Supervised Vision Transformers, Caron et al, CVPR 2021*) would be a stronger baseline than ViT trained with coarser patch size\n  * *Vision Transformer with Super Token Sampling, Huang et al, CVPR 2023* is another method that uses superpixel in Vision transformers. The related work section explains that this method build super-pixel by gradually merging square patches, unlike the current work which uses super-pixels from the start; However, it is not clear to me why this is preferable, and how these two approaches compare in practice. \n  * In addition, there has been many works investigating more flexible tokenization than the standard ViT \"uniform square\" assumption, which is not reflected in the introduction. For instance:\n    * **Token merging** approaches (e.g. \"*`ToME`: Your ViT but faster, Bolya et al, ICLR 2023*\") also alleviate the issues that [quote] *\" complexity and memory scales quadratically with the number of tokens in self-attention\"*\n    * Other works on **dynamic tokenization** (e.g. \"*Vision Transformers with Mixed-Resolution Tokenization, Ronen et al, 2023*\" or \"*MSViT: Dynamic Mixed-Scale Tokenization for Vision Transformers, Havtorn et al, 2023*\") also propose to incorporate mixed-resolution information directly at the input tokens stage and also show that ViT \"can be succesfully trained under irregular tokenization\"\n    * `Swin` transformers and other **multi-scale works** gradually build multi-scale tokens, hence they do not have the issue that [quote] *\"the scale of the partitions are rigidly linked to the model architecture by a fixed patch size\"*\n\n**Overall summary:** My main concern is that it is not clear to me why using superpixels as tokens is advantageous with respect to other methods implementing some form of input-dependent tokenization, either in terms of performance or computational cost. The main gain seems to be in obtaining more fine-grained interpretability maps, but these are also only compared to the standard ViT-backbone (and the random voronoi cell baseline)\n\n**Post-rebuttal note:**  As some other reviewers mentioned, Is still have some reserves about the novelty/impact of the proposed method; however, in light of the rebuttal addressing several concerns and showing promising results on dense prediction tasks, I am raising my score from 5 to 6"

Generally, I am not sure what the conclusion of Section 2.4 is and how significant it is.\n\n- **Number of tokens and batched executions:** In Section 2.2, it is said that \"*We empirically verify that setting T = 4 produces comparable numbers of tokens to a ViT-B16*\"; Does this mean that each image has a different number of tokens in practice, and how does this impact batched execution during training/inference ?\n\n\n- **Evaluation on segmentation:** The choice of super-pixels seem particularly relevant for more dense tasks such as segmentation: This might be a more favorable task to evaluate on than image classification."
