This method provides a clear, human-readable format, unifying the representation of various IE tasks and addressing challenges associated with traditional natural language instructions.

The choice of code-based prompting can potentially hinder usability for general users. Those unfamiliar with coding might find it challenging to interact with or fully leverage the model, thereby narrowing its applicability.\n\n3. The method's efficacy remains unclear due to incomplete experimental validation. Specific concerns include:\n\n   a. **Prompt Style Impact**: The rationale for using a Python code style prompt is not experimentally validated. It's untested whether natural language prompts with guidelines might yield similar outcomes. Although CodeIE validated code style prompts for OpenAI models, the necessity of this design for open-source LLMs during instruction tuning remains unproven.\n\n   b.**Prompt Sensitivity**: The paper omits experiments examining the sensitivity of prompts, leading to concerns about the method's stability. The model's performance under varying definitions, code structures, and code comment styles remains unexplored, making its robustness questionable.\n\n4. The paper lacks experiments analyzing the impact of training dataset diversity on the LLM's ability to follow unseen guidelines. It remains unclear how much data is required to achieve satisfactory performance, leaving questions about the scalability and efficiency of the approach.\n\n\n\n[1] Description-Based Zero-shot Fine-Grained Entity Typing"

How did the authors handle the sampling process for the datasets used in this study? Were experiments conducted to assess the effects of different sampling techniques on the results? This aspect wasn't addressed in the paper and could provide clarity on the method's robustness across varied data distributions.\n2. **Scalability with Numerous Labels**: For datasets with a large number of labels, say in the order of hundreds, the input length for your method could become substantially lengthy, leading to efficiency concerns. In such complex scenarios with multiple labels, how does the inclusion of guidelines impact the performance? This wasn't touched upon in the paper but would provide deeper insights into the method's scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.\n3. **QLoRA vs. Full Model Fine-tuning**: The authors mentioned employing QLoRA for training, citing its superior performance over fine-tuning the entire model on zero-shot tasks and faster training speed. However, the paper lacks empirical evidence to support this. What are the relative impacts of full-parameter SFT and techniques like LoRA and QLoRA on zero-shot IE performance?\n4. **Benchmark Selection**: Many of the state-of-the-art methods used for comparison in the paper, such as UIE, appear outdated. Why weren't more recent and potentially stronger methods like USM, InstructUIE, and GPT4 considered for benchmarking?"
