For example, when setting $\\alpha=6$ as used in the experiments, the constant can be as large as 392, which is a very large number. I suggest the authors provide the regret bound (not only the order) of alternative methods and compare them. It will also be better to plot the regret bounds and the communication complexity bounds of the proposed method and alternative methods.\n\n2. Can the authors clarify what is indeed the most important measurement (time or communication) in the MA2B task? The authors explained that synchronous updates will lead to redundant communication (Section 3.1). This is reasonable, but what is the final purpose of saving communication? Is it to achieve a lower regret within a shorter time horizon? If time is the most important thing, then by Figure 1,2, the performance of the proposed method is not as good as UCB-IBC.\n\n3. I can see that from Theorem 2, a smaller alpha yields smaller regret. I can also see that from Figure 1,2, the proposed method has a higher regret compared to UCB-IBC. Therefore, I'm interested in the question of when we use smaller $\\alpha$ to achieve similar regret as UCB-IBC, will the number of communications of the proposed method still be much smaller?"

This means that communication between agents is not so important and even if there are only a few communications, smaller $R(T)/T$ can still be achieved by using a large T. Can the authors intuitively explain the philosophy behind this property?\n\nI'm not familiar with this topic, but if the authors can clarify my concerns, then I'm willing to improve my score."

There is no mention of the values of the buffer threshold used in AAE-ODC for the experiments presented in the paper\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n**Potentially misleading claim about the communication cost of the SE-AAC-ODC:**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe authors claim that the communication cost of SE-AAC-ODC, which scales as $O(KM\\log \\Delta^{-1})$ is much smaller than that of (Chen et. al. 2023), in which the communication cost scales as $O(KM^2 \\Delta^{-2}\\log T)$ as claimed in this paper. However, the authors haven't mentioned all the details from (Chen et. al. 2023). Recall from the previous bullet that the algorithms in (Chen et. al. 2023) use buffer thresholds.\n- The communication cost scaling as $O(KM^2 \\Delta^{-2}\\log T)$ of the AAE-ODC algorithm in (Chen et. al. 2023) only holds when the buffer thresholds are constant with respect to the number of communications (ref: Corollary 1, part (b) in (Chen et. al. 2023)).\n- However, if the buffer thresholds are exponential with respect to the number of communications, the communication cost of the AAE-ODC algorithm in (Chen et. al. 2023) scales as $O\\big(M^2 \\log \\frac{K \\log T}{\\Delta^2}\\big)$ (ref: Corollary 2, part (b) in (Chen et. al. 2023)).\n\nI claim that when $K$ is very large (and $K > M$), the communication cost of the AAE-ODC algorithm in (Chen et. al. 2023) with the exponential buffer threshold is smaller than that of the communication cost of SE-AAC-ODC in this paper, unless the time horizon $T$ scales doubly exponentially in $K$. It can be quickly noticed by taking the ratio of the communication costs $\\frac{M^2 \\log \\frac{K \\log T}{\\Delta^2}}{KM\\log \\frac{1}{\\Delta}} = \\frac{M \\log \\frac{K \\log T}{\\Delta^2}}{K\\log \\frac{1}{\\Delta}}$, which is less than some small constant (ignoring other constants in the $O$ notation) for $T=O(\\exp (K^{-1}\\exp(K)))$ (assuming natural logarithm). This makes the constant communication cost of SE-AAC-ODC algorithm in this paper vacuous.\n\n- The preceding discussion also puts the validity of the numerical experiments into question."
