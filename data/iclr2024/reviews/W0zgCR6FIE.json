Why not evaluate the W2D method (Huang et al. 2022) that is designed to handle two shifts, which is the main focus of Spawrious?\n\n**[More comprehensive benchmark of architecture]**: Wenzel et al. [1] did a comprehensive evaluation of OOD generalization. One of the conclusions is that architectures (such as Deit, Swin, and ViT) play a key role in improving OOD robustness. Although the paper benchmarks many group robustness methods and compares two architectures (Appendix D), I think it is necessary to see more results in terms of different neural architectures on the new benchmark based on conclusions in [1].\n\n### Minor Concerns\n\n**[More results of foundation models]**: To show that this Spawrious is really challenging, I think we evaluate the performance of foundation models (e.g., CLIP [2] with zero-shot transfer) pretrained on web-scale datasets.\n\nI wonder why the authors argued that ImageNet-W (Li et al, 2023) is synthetic (Section 2, page 3). The watermark shortcut in ImageNet-W naturally exists in the real-world ImageNet dataset.\n\n### References\n\n[1] Florian Wenzel, Andrea Dittadi, Peter Vincent Gehler, Carl-Johann Simon-Gabriel, Max Horn, Dominik Zietlow, David Kernert, Chris Russell, et al., \u201cAssaying Out-Of-Distribution Generalization in Transfer Learning,\u201d in NeurIPS, 2022.\n\n[2] Alec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Chris Hallacy, Aditya Ramesh, Gabriel Goh, Sandhini Agarwal, Girish Sastry, Amanda Askell, et al., \u201cLearning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision,\u201d in ICML, 2021."

This dataset offers three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard) for evaluating the robustness of classifiers against spurious correlations. The dataset consists of approximately 152,064 high-resolution images of 224 \u00d7 224 pixels. The dataset's size and quality make it a valuable resource for testing and probing classifiers' reliance on spurious features.\n\nExperimental evaluation: The paper explores different model architectures and robustness methods, evaluating their performance on the dataset, revealing that larger architectures can sometimes improve performance but the gains are inconsistent across methods. The experimental results demonstrate that state-of-the-art methods struggle to perform well on the Spawrious dataset, particularly in the most challenging scenarios (Hard-splits) where accuracy remains below 73%. This highlights the dataset's effectiveness in pushing the boundaries of current classifier robustness. The paper provides evidence for the reliance of models on spurious features through an analysis of model misclassifications. \n\nOverall, the strengths of the paper lie in its creation of a challenging benchmark dataset and the empirical evidence it provides about the limitations of state-of-the-art methods in handling spurious correlations in image classification, stimulating the need for future research and developments in this domain."

Because of this text-based control, the benchmark has a many-to-many spurious signal set, which can be completely reversed between training and testing---a challenging condition for current algorithms. The primary task is dog classification. This paper then tests several approaches for training a model to be robust to spurious correlations, and finds that Mixup does particularly well for many-to-many spurious correlation and Just-train-twice is the best performing for One-to-One spurious settings."

The authors discuss this issue in Appendix F. The authors attempt a manual and an automatic filtering process. However, both of these also might be susceptible to failure in different ways.\n\n- **Insights**: Table 1 is a very compelling result for mixup, and it points at trying to better understand its properties theoretically w.r.t. to spurious signals.
