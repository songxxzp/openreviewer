This work proposes a data-centric framework called the COncept Drift simulAtor (CODA). CODA leverages a predicted feature correlation matrix to simulate future data for model training. This matrix represents data characteristics at each time point and serves as a trigger for generating future data. The propose method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on some classification and regression problem. Further, it is shown that using CODA-generated data for training enables effective temporal domain generalization across various model architectures, demonstrating high transferability."

It is intractable to learn the correlation matrix on the high-dimensional data. I guess that's why some dataset such as rotating NIST has been excluded from evaluation.\n- The proposed method achieves the SOTA accuracy (which is great and I am impressed). But, it seems non-intuitive to me since it requires separate steps to solve the final task. In deep learning, usually, end-to-end learning for the final tasks work better. Also I am not sure how efficient this method is since it requires 3 or 4 steps: (1) learning the correlation matrix; (2) learning the data simulator; (3) tuning the data simulator; (4) learning the final classifier/regressor. \n- I have another idea which seems simpler for future data simulation. Why not training a conditional data generator which uses the time index (encoded with the Position Embedding modules) as the condition. This idea is also used in diffusion models when $\\epsilon(x_t, t)$ is modelled.\n\n## Minor concerns\n- The explanation for tuning the data simulator based on the classification/regression models is not clear to me. I did not understand how it is performed and if it is a separate step or not.\n- The formulation only uses the last domain and not all the previous domains."

In particular, the authors have emphasized that existing TDG methods are model-centric, which are *unnecessarily comprehensive*, and therefore, TDG should be addressed via a data-centric approach. I doubt this point, as generating samples, in principle, is more challenging than discriminating them. With that said, I am not against the approach itself, but the paper presents it in a way that the data-centric itself is superior to model-centric, which I cannot agree with.   \n2. In addition, generating the instances itself is challenging, but not necessary -- one may generate the feature samples in the representation space. After all, the ultimate goal is to train a predictor that generalizes well on the future domain rather than to generate the instances themselves. \n3. TDG has been studied recently. However, the authors only review two of them (DRAIN and GI), missing a few related works in the literature (e.g., [1, 2]). In fact, I think [2] also adopted a generative approach that *predicts* the feature domain. The authors should clarify the contributions and novelties given these works.\n4. Why modeling the correlation between two consecutive domains is not clear to me. After all, it only captures the second-order information of data.\n5. The form of the simulator $\\mathcal{G}$ is not clearly defined in the paper. In particular, from Sec. 3.3, it is still not clear to me how the synthetic dataset $\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}_{T+1}$ is generated from Eq (4). In Appendix B.1 it only says that $\\mathcal{G}$ is a generative model, but how the estimated correlation matrix and $\\mathcal{D}_T$ are incorporated in the generation process is not clear to me.\n6. The empirical analysis is weak. In addition to the baseline algorithms mentioned above. Several commonly used benchmark data sets are also missing, including both synthetic (e.g., Circle, Sine) and real (e.g., RMNIST, Portraits, Ocular, Caltran, WILDS) data sets. \n\n\n\n[1] Tiexin Qin, Shiqi Wang, and Haoliang Li.

If it is high, how to guarantee the consistency of the estimation?\n2. In Eq (3), how the cross entropy between two matrices is defined? Why both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ norm regularizations are imposed?\n3. Are stage one (Sec. 3.2) and stage two (Sec. 3.3) trained individually or interactively? \n4. I am a little confused with Eq (5): why does the reconstruction loss is defined over two different domains $T+1$ ($\\hat{\\mathcal{D}}_{T+1}$) and $T$ ($\\mathcal{D}_T$)? \n5. I cannot see the connection between Theorem 1 and the proposed method (e.g., Eq (5)). From my understanding, Theorem 1 states that for two random vectors, if they are bounded and their distributions are close, then the difference between their correlation matrices are also bounded. But how this is related to the algorithm? In Eq (5), the distance is already constrained by the regularization term."
