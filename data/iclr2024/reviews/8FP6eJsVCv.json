I also contest that \"good indicators should follow a progressive steady positive slope\", as if the goal is distribution shift detection, the only thing that should matter is the outcome of the hypothesis test.\n\n2. All of the datasets considered are tabular datasets. How would the authors adapt their method to images (where X could be pixels) and text (where X is a sequence of tokens and f is an LLM)? It seems like Shapley values would be less meaningful and harder to compute in these settings.\n\n3. In the real-world datasets, it is unclear what the ground truth should be, and so it is hard to say whether the proposed method is behaving as intended. For example, how do we know in Section 5.2.2 that the distribution in CA18 is actually different than CA14, in a way that affects model performance?\n\n4. One important aspect of distribution shift detection is to isolate the shift to particular distributions (i.e. particular shifts in Definitions 2.1-2.5). This is underexplored in most of paper. The authors do explore this by examining the feature importances in Section 5.2.2, but this seems quite ad-hoc and should be characterized further. For example, how would this behave theoretically in the covariate shift case in Example 4.1?\n\n5. The authors should consider examining the scenario where the number of samples on the target domain is limited, both empirically and theoretically. How does the power of the two-sample test scale with the number of target domain samples?\n\n6. The authors have missed several important prior works [1-2], which should be baselines.\n\n7.

The stated goal of investigating interaction between distribution shifts and learned model needs to be further characterized in quantifiable forms. \nI agree that not every type of distribution shifts are important to detect. The ones that change model behaviour in some meaningful way are important. However, it is unclear to me why explanations, that too Shapley values, is a meaningful or useful summary of model behavior to consider. Say, we care about AUC or any metric of choice to summarize model behavior, we can directly detect shifts in this metric using the same classification pipeline as proposed. If the reason for using explanations is for the interpretability of the shift in model behavior, the problem and solution needs to be stated differently.\nI think that some of this is addressed in the Appendix by pointing to related work that uses explanations for model debugging, drift detection, or other tasks. This could be used in Introduction to more clearly motivate the approach. \n- Evaluation setup can be improved in terms of quantifying evaluation metrics like sensitivity. \nThe magnitude of AUC does not matter that much I believe. Authors are right in asking for sensitivity in the method but it is not directly evaluated. For instance in Figure 2, it is unclear between (ours) and (B7) methods in the left figure and between (ours) and (B2) which one is better. All seem sensitive in the sense that different correlation coefficients result in different AUCs.\n- Presentation of experiment can be improved. The case study on ACS data in Sec 5.2.2 is a good place to showcase how the question in the paper title (how the shift impacted the model) is addressed by the method. The findings are stated in a matter-of-fact way. These could be contextualized in the data making the significance of the method and its results more apparent. The questions asked through the experiments could be described at the start of Sec 5 and what we learned from the results could be described more directly at the end of the section."

Explanation method, in the proposed approach, helps in creating better and more relevant features for use by the classifier. Therefore, consider describing how to choose the classifier and the explanation method.\n\nExplain C2ST (which I believe is classifier two-sample test?) in Experiments on Page 7.\n\nExplain the reasoning for choosing novel group shift in Sec 5.2.1 and discuss the results in more detail.\n\nGeopolitical -> geographical in Section 5.2.2\n\nOn the use of Shapley values, the claim that they account for co-variate interactions (compared to univariate tests) depends on the payoff function (interventional vs observational) used in computing Shapley values (reference Kumar et al. 2020 Problems with Shapley-value-based\u2026 https://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/kumar20e.html).
