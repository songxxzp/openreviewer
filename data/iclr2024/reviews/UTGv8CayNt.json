The general direction of learning policy with demonstrations is good, and the hierarchical RL formulation for this task is also sound and important, although those two ideas are not very novel.\n\n3. The numerical results are good and the improvement looks significant.\n\n4. I like the supplementary video as well, although it can be improved (see below)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "# 1. About the novelty\n\n(1) I think CoT is not very novel in this context and I don't think the proposed approach can be regarded as CoT. The proposed approach refers to a demonstration split methodology (or a subgoal discovery mechanism in hierarchical RL). Since no language is involved, I don't think this method can be related to CoT.\n\n(2) This paper is not positioned well in the context of hierarchical RL + demonstration, so the novelty is not well-stated. The authors should mention, discuss, or compare the following works [1-5]. Disclaim: I am not an author of any of these works. The idea of learning subgoals by similarity or diversity is not novel.\n\n(3) Using transformers in policy learning is not novel as well, and I don't think the major goal of this paper is related to architecture design. If the goal is to claim the novelty of CoT control, the authors should try other architectures as well. Since nowadays transformers are very common architectures, I don't think this can be claimed as a major novelty.\n\n(4) It's unclear why the authors use a single model to learn CoT and learn the action. The authors should try to compare to architectures like [6].\n\n# 2. About the experiments\n\n(1) The authors should discuss their results and summarize the conclusions in the main text. I'm confused about the main result in Tab. 1, and this is because the results are not discussed (the authors only say results in Tab.1 without further explanations). It seems that BC, DT, and BeT are not hierarchical RL methods. So it is very unfair. The authors should not compare to methods that do not use subgoals. Instead, the authors should mainly compare to hierarchical RL methods that leverage demonstrations. The authors should search for [1-5] as long as their follow-up works to get the most related hierarchical RL methods to compare to. \n\n(2) The variance should be shown for each method, and the learning curves are required.\n\n(3) The supplementary videos should be combined with a presentation video, which can reveal the comparisons between the proposed approach and previous works.\n\n# 3. About the writing\n\n(1) The function of the model is not discussed and section 4.2 looks confusing as a result. I think the function and signature of the model should be discussed prior to the model details.\n\n(2) The details of the CoT algorithm are unclear. Particularly, these two sentences look very confusing to me.\n\n\"therefore, propose to group contiguous actions into segments, using a similarity-based heuristic to find these subskills.\" How does the group algorithm work? How to discretize continuous actions?\n\n\"We then utilize the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) method [38] with cosine similarity as the cost metric to generate the changepoints in a per-trajectory manner.\" How does this work? I'm not familiar with the PELT method and this should be discussed in detail.\n\n(3) The authors assume the readers know the decision transformer and detection transformer in advance, which is not very good.\n\n[1] Jiang, Yiding, et al. \"Learning Options via Compression.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 21184-21199.\n\n[2] Eysenbach, Benjamin, et al. \"Diversity is all you need: Learning skills without a reward function.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.06070 (2018).\n\n[3] Konidaris, George, et al. \"Robot learning from demonstration by constructing skill trees.\" The International Journal of Robotics Research 31.3 (2012): 360-375.\n\n[4] Pickett, Marc, and Andrew G.
