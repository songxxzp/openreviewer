(2021), which focuses on training with the statistics of the noise at each timestep rather than direct timesteps, thus allowing flexible use of the model during inference.\" Could you clarify what this means?\t\n\nIn the final loss, you drop the term SNR'/SNR. A large portion of the paper is dedicated to the design of the variance schedule mechanism. Would it be possible to include some more discussion / insights into why this term can reasonably be dropped?

I would be willing to raise my score if the following concerns are addressed.~\n\n**Update**: The authors have addressed the major concerns, so I have updated my score accordingly.\n\n**Major concerns**:\n\n**Uncertainty results**: One of the main motivations of the paper is the ability to report uncertainty in order to point out artifacts in the solutions. In Figure 2, the authors show error images between the reconstructions and the ground truth. Do the uncertainty estimates correspond well to the regions of the image with more error?\n\n**Performance on other datasets**: The performance is not significantly better than other methods for the BioSR super-resolution dataset. If one of the major goals is to demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of this approach, it would be nice to see comparisons against more conditional generative model datasets, especially those in the CDDPM paper (though I understand that there is a focus on inverse problems).\n\n**Flexibility of super-resolution results**: When applied to super-resolution, this method does not require information about the PSF. This means that the model is learning the PSF implicitly from the data, but also means that the model would need to be retrained in order to get accurate results on data from a new PSF, which might be impractical if too much data is required for training. Again, the flexibility and robustness of this method is highlighted, so it would be nice to see some experiments or discussion addressing this, e.g. comparison against other blind deconvolution methods on datasets with different PSFs.\n\n**Estimating pixelwise schedule**: The schedules demonstrated for structured versus background regions appear to be linear with different slopes for the different regions. Would other/baseline methods perform better using an estimated linear pixelwise schedule with a higher slope on \"structured\" regions?\n\n**Minor concerns**:\n\n**Fourier features**: The original VDM paper showed that a significant amount of the performance was due to the use of Fourier features. It would be helpful to know whether anything like that is the case here.\n\n**Differences from VDM**: It would be helpful to have an explicit list or section summarizing the differences/extensions from VDM.\n\n**Figure design**: Many of the figures are very small and laid out in a way that makes comparing images and reading text difficult, e.g. in Figure 3 it is difficult to see the sections from which the schedules are being estimated."

This is an interesting topic since fine-tuning the schedule can be quite time consuming. The main contribution of this paper is to make the schedule dependent on the conditioning variable and to devise an appropriate learning procedure. \n\n\n[1]\u00a0Kingma, Diederik, et al. \"Variational diffusion models.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 21696-21707."

The main difference with the methodology developed in [1] is the replacement of the unstable SNR term. While this yields good results in practice, I am not sure if this is enough novelty for a conference like ICLR."
