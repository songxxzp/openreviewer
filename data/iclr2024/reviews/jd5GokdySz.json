For now all perturbations seem weak, they are small perturbations around the image, barely visible to humans. There are many strong generation models, such as edge-conditioned ControlNet, or inpating based diffusion models that can generate very diverse outputs in terms of colors, and styles. I think these strong perturbations would be very interesting and naturally suitable in this framework.\n2. There\u2019s limited understanding of what the perturbed images are. This is important to support the \u201cdiversity\u201d argument in the introduction. How similar are the images to ImageNet-C perturbations?\n3.

For the data distribution, there is also a gap between ImageNet training and foundation model training left unaddressed."

Rather than relying solely on fixed benchmarks, the authors propose a method that directly measures image classification models' performance in comparison to a surrogate oracle, a set of foundational models. They extend image datasets with perturbed samples that maintain the original image-label structure but are distinct from the original set. This approach allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of models' robustness, overcoming limitations associated with fixed benchmarks and constrained perturbations. The paper not only presents evaluation results but also provides insights into model behaviors and the new evaluation strategies employed."

I really don't understand why the performance needs to be compared with the foundation model. If there are already foundation model for the given task, is it really necessary to train a new model with similar architecture from scratch?\n3. If users need to train different generative models for various downstream tasks, I think this evaluation approach is not user-friendly.\n4. Is there a possibility that because the evaluation method proposed in this paper uses VQGAN, and DAT also utilizes VQGAN during training, DAT performs best under this specific evaluation scenario? If that's the case, the evaluation method proposed in this paper might not provide enough insight to the readers."

The big difference is this proposed method will take the \"to-be\" evaluated model into account when generating the \"adversarial examples\". It looks like this proposed method could generate \"personalized\" \"adversarial\" examples for the \"to-be\" evaluated models. So each \"to-be\" evaluated model may be evaluated on totally different datasets. But in order to fairly compare across different \"to-be\" evaluated models, the authors normalize their performance by the pre-trained large foundation model? However, I do not see any benefits as to why this evaluation pipeline could better reflect real-world scenarios.\n\n3) It is not clear what \"SA\" means. Is SA the clean test accuracy of the foundation model? Also, there is an abusive use of \"SA\" to present two different terms in this paper---- SA for \"standard accuracy\" and SA for \"self-attention\".\n\n4) If the perturbed generated images are the images that cause the maximum classification loss of the \"to-be\" evaluated model, then it will definitely result in a very bad classification performance of the \"to-be\" evaluated model on the perturbed images. It is not clear to me how the authors do this kind of evaluation. From my current understanding, the generated images have already had the knowledge of the \"to-be\" evaluated model. Then I doubt how \"PA/SA\" could be a fair comparison for different \"to-be\" evaluated models.\n\n5) The overall idea looks very similar to \"adversarial training\". The big difference is instead of using \"norm-bouned\" perturbation, here the authors use the prediction of large foundation models as a constraint to limit the perturbation to not go too far. So from this perspective, I only see limited novelty of this proposed method. And even, the perturbed images may be eventually biased towards the foundation models.\n\n6) Could we also report the performance of the \"to-be\" evaluated models on some of fixed benchmarks as a robustness reference?"
