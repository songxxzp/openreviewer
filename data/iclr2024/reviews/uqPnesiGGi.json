In my understanding, inter-motif influence is only considered as an evaluation metric. Is it considered in the pre-training process?\n2. If the inter-motif influence is an evaluation process, then the main contribution of the MoAMa is masking the whole motif instead of masking nodes. It comes up with an issue that completely masking the entire motif might be excessively difficult for the pre-trained GNN to reconstruct. Specifically, if all the nodes within a k-hop range of a motif are masked, then that particular node will never acquire any information about the features of its neighbors.\n3. The complexity of calculating inter-motif influence needs to be discussed. For each graph, influence between any two nodes needs to be calculated by applying two modified graphs into a graph neural network, which means it needs to run the graph neural networks at most O(N^2) times. I highly recommend authors discuss the complexity of their proposed evaluation method.\n4. How have the authors presented the test AUC? Is it the test AUC corresponding to the best validation AUC, or is it the final test AUC? It's essential to provide clarity on these experimental configurations to ensure the results can be reproduced.\n5. The layout of the paper, especially section 4.3, is unclear. I found it challenging to link section 4.3 with its preceding section. Additionally, section 4.4 appears to have a closer relation to section 4.2, given its extended discussion on the pre-training strategy."

Therefore, to capture the interaction information between motifs, it is important to transfer inter-motif structural knowledge and other long-range dependencies during the pre-training of graph neural networks. - while this says that interactions are important, it does not say that neighbor information is not important or, specifically, that it is less important\n   * \"Unfortunately, the random attribute masking strategies used in previous work for graph pre-training were not able to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in inter-motif knowledge (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Hu et al., 2020b; Pan et al., 2019).

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The proposed method does not seem solid enough. Many details lack theoretical support. For example, the criteria to restrain the masked motif selection is intuitive without much explanation. The authors claim that the proposed method is able to utilize graph structure, while it is unclear how the motif-aware masking addresses this issue. Another claimed contribution is to capture both local and long-range information, while it is not discussed how the motif masking captures long-range other than random masking. The masked motifs can still be close, and the message passing is still within the k-hop. \n- The L_aux is proposed to complement L_rec since attribute masking focuses on local graph structures. Then this loss seems to fit with all the attribute masking methods. The results in Table 1 show that, MoAMa w/o Laux does not show much superiority compared with other baselines. It seems that the proposed motif-aware masking might perform limited. The authors should try Laux on other attribute masking methods to see if there are improvements. Also, it is not well elaborated on why and how Eq. 14 is designed.\n- The results do not seem promising, and as the last point states, the effectiveness of the proposed motif-aware masking is questionable. \n- The paper lacks an overall framework to help understand the detailed implementation. \n- The technical novelty of the paper is relatively incremental for an ICLR paper. The paper primarily focuses on a narrow aspect of the pretraining method, switching from random masking to motif-wise random masking, which may have limited impact on the community."
