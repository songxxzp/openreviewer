                "value": "The paper presents a core-set selection method based on the gradient-direction similarity (cosine distance) at the early phases of training (5-10 epochs). While the underlying idea (and its simplicity) is appealing and first experimental results are promising, the paper does not seem to be in a finalized form. I believe it requires a further iteration to establish the full potential of the method. Length and content-wise, it would fit a densely written 4-page workshop paper very well in preparation for a future main conference paper submission, e.g., for ICML or CVPR. Overall, I think this paper (in the current version) is not refined/detailed enough for the main conference and would require further experimental and comparative work to be competitive with other submitted papers.\n\nConcretely,\n1 while several approaches are discussed in related work, the proposed GradSimCore method is only compared to \"DeepCore\". \n2 also this \"DeepCore\" comparison is not very clear: it is stated that DeepCore is a library for coreset selection. To which algorithm in this library is the method compared to? \n3 the manuscript overall seems to be very stretched in the length to barely fill the length requirement of 9 pages. Tables are stretched; Algorithm 1 could fit half the width, The notation table is not necessary. Can be described at shorter length in text, Table 1 could also be described shorter in text. \n\nContent-wise, \n1. it is not clear if the method seen as a baseline (called as such in the discussion) or as a new state-of-the-art method (it beats the DeepCore comparison method across several datasets)\n2. equation 3 seems to be the cosine similarity. It should be also called as such.\n3. equation 4. Why is the expectation used here? Interpreting this (discrete) equation, a simple average 1/N sum would be sufficient and clearer\n5. equation 5. How is the threshold chosen? Given the experiments (percentage of the datasets), it seems that the threshold is not used but the samples are rather sorted by f(x) score and the top x% samples are chosen"

There are several assumptions made about the what an averaged gradient would imply or what it means for a sample to produce a gradient that is also closer to other samples, that need a more rigorous mathematical underpinning. It is not often clear or true that samples that produce noise-free gradients are the most representative. In fact, often the opposite is true and has been utilized in a lot of data sampling techniques from hard-negative mining to label softening, just to produce noisy gradients. This is also a reason why regularization techniques such as dropouts work. The authors assumption may only be true in cases where there are some stringent constraints on the loss manifold.\n2. The algorithm itself is tremendously computationally expensive. Quick back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate that for complete Imagenet dataset, most modern server-class instances will not be able to even hold the gradients in memory. Computationally, it will be more expensive to identify the coreset, than to run training on the entire dataset.\n3. The experimentation is done on small datasets, in smaller models. From the results, it looks like their work only works at low-accuracy levels (or extremely low data sizes). In modern day ML, unless there is parity in accuracy (generalization performance), its not a practically usable model, no matter the constraints. Putting aside the pragmatism, the results show that the authors' approach does not apply at even relatively modest size of coreset."
