                "value": "This introduction highlights the wide-ranging prevalence of optimization problems in operations, economics, engineering, and computer science. It emphasizes their significance in applications like improving energy efficiency in smart grids, refining supply chains, and enhancing profits in algorithmic trading. The paper underlines the critical role of algorithm selection and problem modeling in achieving successful solutions.\nThe expertise required to navigate these challenges creates a barrier for many sectors, including supermarkets, hospitals, municipalities, solar farms, and small businesses, limiting their access to optimization benefits.\nThe paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to democratize access to optimization. LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in understanding and generating natural language, offering a means to simplify problem formulation and disseminate expert knowledge. However, their role in optimization remains underexplored due to their novelty and the lack of comprehensive benchmarks.\nThe paper introduces three key contributions:\n1. The NLP4LP dataset comprises 40 expert-formulated linear programming (LP) and mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. It includes annotated solutions, optimality-checking code, and sample formulations in markdown and code formats. The dataset uses a standardized format for representing optimization problems in natural language.\n2. OptiMUS, an LLM-based agent designed for formulating and solving optimization problems, was introduced.\n3. Developing techniques to enhance OptiMUS's performance, including automated data augmentation through problem rephrasing and self-improvement of solutions via automated testing and debugging. These techniques lead to a 67% increase in the solve rate compared to direct prompting.\nIn summary, the paper's contributions aim to democratize access to optimization techniques across various domains, extending their reach and utility."

The results of solving 32 different LPs and 8 different MILPs are summed for the experiment. This bais of problem types makes it difficult to compare whether the results of the experiments are more influenced by the nature of the problem (LP or MILP) or the nature of the method.\n4. The experiment in Figure 6 should describe the problems used. It is difficult to determine whether the results are the average of multiple problems or the results of solving one problem.\n5. There is no description of the solver used in the experiments. We believe that the choice of solver is important to improve the success rate and execution rate. Therefore, the experiment section should state what solver was used and, if OptiMUS selected it, how it was selected.\n\nThis study covers an exciting subject. I hope that future studies will improve the weaknesses mentioned above."

Basically, OptiMUS leverages LLM to generate the mathematical formulation and test code from the SNOP and to iteratively debug the solver code. If so, I'm afraid this work is kind of engineering without much novelty.\n- The experiments are far from exhaustive. In the paper, only execution and success rates are reported but there are many aspects of solving optimization problems to discuss. See Questions for more detail on this point.\n- The instances in the benchmark set NLP4LP are collected from optimization textbooks and lecture notes. They are more like toy examples (which means they are not representative of real problems) and typically with small sizes. And conclusions drawn on 40 instances can be unreliable."

                "value": "Major comments: I do have several concerns on OptiMUS from the optimization solving perspective.\n\n- If I understand correctly, the mathematical formulation of the problem is generated from the SNOP provided by users. I'm wondering how to guarantee the correctness of the mathematical formulation. Moreover, the test code is also generated by LLM. It could happen that LLM misunderstands the SNOP, generates the wrong mathematical formulation and corresponding wrong test script. In such case the solver solves a wrong problem but passes the test. Is OptiMUS able to detect and circumvent such scenarios?\n- Typically, modern solvers have many parameters and options to set. Different options can generate very different outputs. Is the output of OptiMUS stable or not?\n- As mentioned in the paper, OptiMUS checks correct formatting and constraint satisfaction, namely feasibility. Does OptiMUS check optimality of the output?\n- The instances in NLP4LP are collected from classic optimization textbooks and lecture notes. There are chances that these materials are included in the training data of LLM, which makes the numerical results here less convincing. Moreover, these instances can be very different with real problems and they have relatively small scale. My suggestion is that experiments on real-world problems should be conducted to further demonstrate the effectiveness of OptiMUS.\n\nOther comments: \n- I find it difficult to read Figure 5. Why are success rates always higher than the execution rates? In other words, what is the definition of success rate? In Page 8, the authors write ``success rate (the ratio of outputs satisfying all constraints and finding the optimal solution)\". Is it the ratio of success number and all instances, or the ratio of success number and execution count?\n- In the abstract, there is a typo \"MLIP\" which should be \"MILP\".\n- The references to the figures in the manuscript (without appendix) need double-check. For example, there are some missing references in page 7.\n- I'm also concern about the reproducibility of the results because the output of LLM can sometimes be irreproducible. Can the authors comment on this point?"

Give some errors in practice.  Of course, I can believe that they `can` do them, but I\u2019m interested in how we can believe their outputs and how often we should take care of them in the pipeline.\n- Minor comments\n    - I\u2019m not exactly sure the reason, but some LaTeX links are not correctly inserted (some points are ??, maybe related to the appendix link).
