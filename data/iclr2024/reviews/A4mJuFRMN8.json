This framework effectively unifies two distinct methodologies, sample reweighting and resampling, facilitating their comparison within a comprehensive framework. Furthermore, the authors undertake an exhaustive analysis, establishing the resampling technique as supremely effective in addressing issues pertinent to noisy label learning."

Following the last point, how different is the Dirichlet-based resampling from just setting a threshold for $\\mu$ and randomly sampling?\n3. Will the method work better if combined with data cleaning or abstention kind of ideas? There is one reference that I found ([1] Koziarski, Micha\u0142, Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak, and Bartosz Krawczyk. \"Combined cleaning and resampling algorithm for multi-class imbalanced data with label noise.\" Knowledge-Based Systems 204 (2020): 106223.).

Can the proposed method be compared with other noisy label learning methods (regularization, loss correction, or data cleaning)?"

This framework encompasses both reweighting and resampling as the two extremes of the Dirichlet distribution. The paper provides analysis of the impact of the shape parameter to the empirical risk and discuss resampling is better than reweighting. The paper finally proposes a method called RENT (resampling utilizing the noise transition matrix). Various experiments show the superiority and characteristics of the proposed method."

Since $\\pi_N$ is a categorical distribution (and not a joint distribution of instances and labels), it seems to me that we can only sample $\\tilde{y}_1, \\ldots, \\tilde{y}_M$ (without $x_1, \\ldots x_M$)?\n- For Proposition 3.1, it might be more clear to present the assumptions directly within the proposition rather than explaining them in the appendix.\n- Is Eq. 7 correct? Should we introduce a different notation for the quantity in Eq.7 instead of writing that this is equivalent with $R_{l, DWS}^{emp}$, since we are applying the CLT in the proof in Appendix C.1 and $N$ is finite?"

                "value": "The paper addresses the crucial issue of learning from noisy labels, emphasizing the significance of the transition matrix in modeling the relationship between noisy and true labels. Rather than concentrating solely on learning this matrix, the authors propose a new approach that leverages it, drawing inspiration from reweighting and resampling concepts. They introduce a Dirichlet-based weighting method, which assigns individual weights to each sample drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. This distribution is parameterized using a base measure informed by the transition matrix. Empirical results indicate that this weighting method outperforms forward risk minimization and direct reweighing techniques."

                "value": "Originality: The concept of imposing a Dirichlet prior on individual sample weights is well-founded. This approach naturally leverages the base measure to integrate the transition matrix, creating an informative prior. Additionally, the ability to control the concentration parameter $\\alpha$ enables the fine-tuning of weight properties, including variance-based regularization and addressing noise-related issues. The practical implementation of this method is straightforward, as demonstrated in Algorithm 1.\n\nSignificance: The significance of this work is underscored by the comparison of the proposed reweighing method with forward risk minimization and an existing reweighting method based on the likelihood ratio. This comparative analysis is conducted across four datasets, and the results demonstrate the promise and potential impact of the proposed approach.\n\nClarity: Overall, the paper effectively conveys its central idea. However, there is room for improvement in terms of notation clarity."
