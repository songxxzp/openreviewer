The authors conduct extensive experimental evaluations, which demonstrate that the proposed method largely outperforms existing works."

Within this loss, the MixUp-based negative sample generation seems an important ingredient, yet with no proper ablation studies.

To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method, it would be also important to analyze each component on a coarse-grained dataset.\n\n(4) Previous work [3] suggests that supervised knowledge is beneficial for the task of NCD when the semantics of labeled and unlabeled data are similar. However, this paper demonstrates that even under a data split where the semantic gap between labeled and unlabeled data is significant, knowledge from a fixed labeled encoder remains helpful. It would be helpful to demonstrate how labeled knowledge transfers to unlabeled data across different scales of semantic differences.\n\n(5) The paper mentions the usage of techniques such as dynamic conception generation [4] and cluster size regularization [5].
