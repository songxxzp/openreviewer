The main contributions of this paper are:\n- It explores the mechanism of CNN memorization for poisoned images from a frequency domain perspective, investigating the generalization of CNN with respect to perturbations in different frequency domains. \n- It explores the generalization of CNN for visible and invisible triggers, demonstrating that high-frequency features are more susceptible to perturbations than low-frequency features. \n- It proposes a generalized strategy for rendering visible backdoor attacks invisible while maintaining algorithmic performance. \n- It proposes a backdoor attack algorithm based on low-frequency semantic information for target classes, achieving high success rates across diverse datasets and models."

Recently, there are many researches about backdoor attacks in the frequency domain. The authors only mentioned one work [1], please discuss more related works such as [2,3,4]. By the way, adversarial attack (aka evasion attack) is closely related to backdoor attack, and there are even more adversarial attacks [5,6] in the frequency domain, and I noticed that the proposed algorithms shown in Figure 5(b) share some similarities with f-mixup in [6].\n\n2. [7,8] has already provided comprehensive analyses about CNN's generalization in the frequency domain, I think most conclusions reached in Section 3 may also be derived from the previous work. In other words, this paper does not provide enough new insights as the authors claimed.\n\n3. The proposed attack is motivated by frequency domain analysis for CNNs , but ViT has different bias in the frequency domain [9], which means that the proposed method may not generalize to ViT. IMHO, this is a great limitation.\n\n4. The authors conducted experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Celeba, it is necessary to validate the proposed algorithms on ImageNet. In my experience, CNNs trained on ImageNet is far less sensitive to high frequencies than CNNs trained on the above datasets.\n\nOverall, although I think this work is interesting, the current manuscript seems to not achieve the bar of ICLR in 2024.\n\n\nReference\n\n[1]  An invisible black-box backdoor attack through frequency domain, ECCV 2022.\n\n[2] FIBA: Frequency-Injection based Backdoor Attack in Medical Image Analysis, CVPR 2022.\n\n[3] Check Your Other Door!

However, the insufficient literature review still heavily weakens the motivation and novelty of this work. Specifically, the authors claimed that \"the research on backdoor attack and defense from a frequency domain perspective is still insufficient\", but actually, there exist many works in this direction. Besides, although the proposed algorithms shown in Figure 5(b) differs from f-mixup in some details, I still think the high-level ideas are similar, since both of inject misleading features into middle-and-high frequency domain. Therefore, although I have raised my score to 5, I think it is okay to reject this paper."

It would be more convincing to report the result against some defense methods e.g. the defense methods supported by backdoorbench [1].\n\n2).

Since invisible backdoor attacks mainly rely on the perturbation on high frequency components, what is the relation or difference between visible backdoor attack and invisible backdoor attack after masking the low-frequency perturbation?\n\n3). Fig.4 shows that it requires smaller perturbation on high frequency than on low frequency to achieve high attack success rate. However, when comparing to the original image, since most mass concentrate in low-frequency components, the small perturbation on high frequency might be relatively large comparing to the original image. It might require more results to show that high frequency components are more susceptible to backdoor attack\n\nOverall, I think the experiments in this paper is not sufficient to support the analysis in this paper and verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n[1] Baoyuan Wu, Hongrui Chen, Mingda Zhang, Zihao Zhu, Shaokui Wei, Danni Yuan, Chao Shen.
