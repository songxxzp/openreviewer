More specifically, the authors consider two types of features in the GNN design: spatial features and flows, which are concatenated.

                "value": "**W1**. A major weakness is the fact that the authors do not report aggregated results across several runs together with statistical confidence measures (e.g. error bars). These should be presented for all figures and tables in order to account for the stochasticity of model training. Otherwise, a possible alternative explanation for the observed results is that one of the \"lucky\" seeds was used, which yields better performance than what we might see in the average case. It is not possible, in my opinion, to draw reliable conclusions from the presented results. In case multiple runs were indeed carried out, these details should be reported.\n\n**W2**. Lack of (mathematical) precision in the description of the problem and solution method. The authors should aim for a level of clarity that would enable someone to reproduce the results starting from the descriptions only. This is currently not the case. Some examples where this is apparent:\n\n- Most importantly, the MDP components (currently in Appendix A) should be formalised mathematically and not described only in plain English. \n- Equation 1: presumably $i \\neq j$, given self-loops are not allowed?\n- Equation 3: $\\mathcal{N}$ was already used to denote the entire set of nodes, whereas in this equation it is used to denote the neighbourhood. They are not the same, unless the graph is fully connected.\n- The set of input features to the GNN should be fully described in the Method section and not only when discussing the ablation results (4.4).\n\t\n**W3**. Potential limited scalability: the authors consider networks with up to 60 nodes, whereas the real Beijing network has approximately ~500 nodes. Hence, the problem as considered is a simplification, and this should be acknowledged. I expect that the observed performance improvement does not come \"for free\", and that the method suffers in scalability and has substantially longer running times than the classic methods. Studying the scalability of the method (around what number of nodes does it fail to find satisfactory solutions compared to the baseline) and adding representative runtimes for the methods would improve the manuscript."

Typos: consider running a spellcheck. Some I have spotted: generic -> genetic (p2), maksed -> masked (p4), donate -> denote (p5)\n\n**C3**. The analysis in 4.5 is tenuous, especially given the lack of multiple runs.

The model in this paper is obviously not a high-fidelity model that could be used in real construction.\n\n5. This paper is not well-written.
