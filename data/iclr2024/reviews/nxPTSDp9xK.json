This makes the work sound and reliable, both in terms of its theoretical framework and practical applicability.\n2. Relevance of the Addressed Problem: The choice of the problem addressed in the paper holds significant value, especially in the context of the substantial computational overhead associated with many state-of-the-art multimodal models. This highlights the practical importance of the research. However, it is recommended that the authors extend their analysis and experimentation to encompass a broader range of models, moving beyond the initial exploration with BLIP-2. This would further enhance the paper's contribution and generalizability."

The approach involves learning a cross-token to serve as guidance for another modality. However, there are concerns about this approach. Taking BLIP as an example, it appears that it may not fully harness textual guidance. In scenarios like visual grounding, where different textual descriptions highlight various aspects of the same image, it raises questions about how CrossGET selects tokens from different texts to focus on.\n2. Unfair Experimental Comparisons: The paper contains instances of unfair comparisons in the experiments. For example, in section 4.1, the authors directly compare retrieval results of models such as TRIPS and UPOP. Yet, these models vary significantly in terms of training data and model parameter sizes, making the comparison less meaningful. To provide a clearer perspective, the paper should emphasize how much TRIPS, or similar acceleration methods, improve over the baseline, and how much the proposed method accelerates and enhances performance compared to the baseline.\n3. Limited Model Performance Improvement: The paper reports only marginal improvements in model performance while introducing a relatively complex method. Moreover, the acceleration achieved by the proposed method appears similar to that of ToMe. Given the relative complexity of the proposed approach, the effectiveness of this work may be questioned, especially if the gains in performance and acceleration are not substantial."

Implementation of Token Reduction in BLIP-2: It would be beneficial for the authors to provide more detailed information on how they specifically implemented token reduction in BLIP-2 within the context of their method. A more elaborate explanation of the process and its impact on BLIP-2's performance would enhance the clarity and completeness of the paper.\n2. Impact of CrossGET on OPT in BLIP-2: A notable aspect of this work is the introduction of CrossGET into the frozen OPT component of BLIP-2 for token reduction. However, it's important to consider that OPT is a decoder-only model. The paper should address how this approach might affect the inference capabilities of OPT and whether any experiments were conducted to analyze and verify why image captioning performance appears to be minimally impacted. Further insight into this aspect of the methodology would enhance the paper's robustness and contribute to a better understanding of the results.Im glad to improve my score if my   concerns be addressed."

                "value": "While this paper presents promising results and extensive evaluations, there are important concerns that should be addressed before publication.\n1. Some experimental results are perplexing. Table 1 suggests that ToMe performs worse when equipped with Adapter or ExtraToken. However, Adapter and VPT are parameter-efficient tuning methods that enhance performance with minimal additional parameters. It is unclear how they could instead degrade performance. I suspect there may be errors in the implementations. It is recommended to double-check the results or provide convincing explanations. Additionally, the upper-right subfigure in Figure 4 is also confusing. In my understanding, CrossGET and ToMe have close GFLOPs under the same configuration (as evident from the left subfigure). Therefore, the significant differences in GFLOPs for each data point pair in the upper-right subfigure indicate that they are compared under different configurations. A reasonable explanation should be provided here. Moreover, the down-right subfigure seems to be unusual as well. How is it possible for the model to achieve even better performance (nearly 86) with only 1/10 GFLOPs? Are the settings the same as in other figures?\n\n2. The contribution of the Complete-Graph Soft Matching (CGSM) appears to be minor. For instance, Table 1 suggests that ToMe and CrossGET $\\Delta$ perform similarly in different metrics, indicating that the proposed CGSM may have little impact. ToMe employs the bipartite soft matching strategy for its efficiency and simplicity, and the ToMe paper demonstrates that this strategy can approximate optimal matching through extensive combination experiments. This paper should provide more evidence (visualizations, analytical experiments) to justify the effectiveness of the proposed CGSM.\n\n3. Most experiments in this paper focus on Image-Text retrieval tasks. Is the proposed method equally effective in other VL tasks, such as the CoOP benchmark or open vocabulary segmentation?\n\n4. This paper lacks an important comparison. [1] proposes reducing the number of tokens through clustering and demonstrates better performance than ToMe in accelerating transformers. However, this paper only briefly mentions it in the introduction without further discussion or comparisons. It is recommended to include more comparisons ([1] vs. CrossGET $\\Delta$, [1] + CGM&CGE vs. CrossGET $\\star$, etc., better in dense prediction tasks) with [1].\n\nI am glad to increase my rating if my concerns are addressed.\n\n[1].

CrossGET is proposed to accelerate heavy VLMs. However, majority of experiments are carried out on relatively light-weighted BLIP. There's only a small section for the truly heavy BLIP2, which is a stronger VLM that really needs acceleration.\n4. CrossGET requires fine-tuning of VLMs. (1) In most cases, when models need fine-tuning, they are relatively small (acceleration is not demanding).
