Strategies that enable LO to work well (stable convergence) will be more interesting and beneficial. The ideas presented in the paper do not improve the robustness of the LO, rather mitigate issues when using it for training a different task. The results indicate only a marginal difference between VeLO (LO), ADAM, and HUB results. Thus, begging the question, the need for an LO. \n- I find the motivation driven by vanishing gradients and the hybrid update equation 5 to be contradicting. When faced with vanishing gradients the convex combination factor of the hand-designed update will be close to 0, forcing the updates to depend on the LO. As LO can be unstable near the optima, how does the proposed strategy facilitate model convergence? \n- There has been (at least one) recent work [1] that also attempts to overcome the challenges with LO raised in the paper. This method appears to be much simpler than the proposed approach. It would be helpful to have some comparison against it.\n- Can you clarify if the stability results on ADAM are authors\u2019 contributions or a restatement of existing literature? \n[1] Learning to learn with better convergence, P Chen, S Reddi, S Kumar and C-J, Hsieh."

The arrangement of contents also made it difficult to read, such as the tables in the experiment section.\n\n- Considering the essense of high-demensionality of modern neural networks, the influence brought in by the hand-designed update in Eqn.
