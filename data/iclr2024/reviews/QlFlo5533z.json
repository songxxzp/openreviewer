Contents:\n1) the related work needs to include more work in these two years. Much related DPSGD work is suitable here and I believe a table for the comparison might be better.\n2) some magnitude about the privacy level should be shown, I just see some examples with the given values and am confused by the quantity. Some theoretical analysis should be given about how much improvement of the privacy level or utility level, is compared with the standard DPSGD.\n3) More clarification about why the proposed method is important. I think it is just adjusting the variance level of DPSGD, it should influence the utility, but what we can lose in the privacy level should be presented. (Or what we derive)\n4) More datasets should be considered since CIFAR is not enough for paper with the experiments consisting of the most parts. Large ones should be used.\n5) Large $\\epsilon$ seems to be meaningless in DP, but there are very large ones shown in the experiments.\n6) how are parameters determined in the real treatment, like scaling factors, or variants. Some criteria should be shown."

                "value": "1. Auto DP-SGD does not satisfy differential privacy, because the noise that it injects into the gradient sum is a computed from the individual gradient norms, whereas individual gradient norms are private information. \n\nTo illustrate this issue, consider an extreme case where all records in the input dataset D have zero gradients. In that case, in Auto DP-SGD the distribution of the noisy gradient is degenerated to the point of zero (because s_t = 0 in Auto DP-SGD). Now consider neighboring dataset D\u2019 that has one non-zero gradient. The noisy gradient sum distribution of D\u2019 is a Gaussian (because s_t is non-zero). Comparing these two distributions of D and D\u2019, it is apparently that they have unbounded divergence. This indicates a violation of differential privacy.\n\n2. I am not convinced by the the authors\u2019 claims that \"CDP and zCDP accountants lack privacy amplification by sampling\" and \"the RDP accountant Abadi et al. (2016) overestimates privacy costs\". Both CDP and RDP enjoy the same level of privacy amplification by subsampling, since they are both based on the Renyi divergence and can be converted to each other in many cases. Previous papers (e.g., see https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220076) have also used CDP in DPSGD.\n\n3. It is not a common practice to evaluate the performance of DP training algorithms on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 *only* on pertained models. Please refer to https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.13650.pdf for more comprehensive evaluation setups.\n\n4. The paper misses existing work on automatic clipping and privacy budget scheduling. For example, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3219819.3220076 for one of the first papers that propose to use an adaptive privacy budget scheduling for DPSGD, and see https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07136 for automatic clipping."

The contribution is not enough and not significant, e.g. the original content from this work only starts from page 5. Specifically, one of the \"claimed\" contribution is the proposal of three new noise multiplier decay mechanisms: Auto DP-T/S/E. However, Auto DP-S/E are useless according to Table 16 and thus not present in the main text. This is trivial novelty.\n\n3. The proposed Algorithm 1 is computationally infeasible, essentially setting batch size as 1, and even so is memory prohibitive. Unlike modern DP-SGD, which takes batch size 64 for one back-propagation and can be as memory efficient as non-DP SGD (see \"Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost\"), Algorithm 1 needs 64 back-propagations and takes too long to train. As for the memory, the gradient list G from both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 requires to store B*model_size parameter (B being batch size). This is impossible for large models with over 1B parameters, whereas state-of-the-art DP-SGD can already handle 100B parameters. In fact, I am shocked that the obvious computation inefficiency is not discussed in work.\n\n4. Performance is too weak, datasets are too easy and comparison to old benchmarks is unfair. E.g. SOTA CIFAR100 at epsilon=2 is around 90%, where the authors got 79%; achieving >98% on MNIST can be traced back to 2020 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14191.pdf).\n\n5. The name \"Auto DP-SGD\" is already used in other papers, possibly making the readers confused."
