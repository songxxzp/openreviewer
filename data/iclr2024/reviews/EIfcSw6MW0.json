As such, it makes it very hard to identify what exactly has been done.\n\nThat said, even if well presented, the proposed technique results in only a modest increase in certified robustness, and at the expense of clean accuracy drop. Also, it is beaten by techniques like LocalBCP - which admittedly needs more time and memory, but then again so does the proposed technique vs the baseline BCP method.\n\nThis arguable improvement on the baselines and the poor presentation lead to my current score. Though happy to revise based on any feedback/updates.\n\nMiscellaneous comments:\n\nLocalBCP is used as a baseline in the tables and yet not mentioned in the text (e.g. under Related Work)\n\nSome comparison with Randomised Smoothing techniques in the experiments might have been good to see.\n\n- Grammatical/presentation issues throughout, for example:\n  + \"It causes the clean accuracy of the main inference task because the DNNs model is too regularisation\"\n  +  Section 3 describing related work could be broken into more readable paragraphws\n  + The 3rd paragraph of section 4.1 is very unclear\n  + 4th and 5th lines of section 4.4 are repeated?\n  + \"matirx\"\n  + \"Upadte\"\n  + \"..., which make The entrire clean reserved process can be integrated ...\"\n- \"randomized smoothing requires adding a smooth classifier to the input\". No, it adds noise to the input\n- It is claimed that randomized smoothing is inadequate because it is probabilistic. However, this threshold can be set as per required risk appetite. This is not as big an issue as I think the authors make out\n- Issues with presentation of maths:\n  + \"The matrix A\" mentioned above equation (4) has not been mentioned before/defined\n  + Typo z_0 should be z_{y_0} above equation (5)\n  + \\hat z in the minimisation in equation (7) has not been defined\n  + Line 8 of Alg 1: Lip_{cer} has not been initialised so this line does not work the first time it is encountered\n  + Line 11 of Alg 1: U_{cer} and V_{cer} have not been computed and yet they are used here\n  + Line 13 of Alg 1: z^*_{cer} is computed here and yet not used??"

Doesn't this depend on the parameter \\epsilon? ie if epsilon is small enough, it should be able to be certified\n\nThere seems to be a misunderstanding of certified robustness. e.g. it is stated \"\"inputs satisfying certified robustness may still be adversarial examples\". However, surely certifying robustness means asserting that if the classifier gives label y at x then it will give label y at all points within a distance epsilon of x. It is nothing to do with x being an adversarial example. Certification is a guarantee that there is no adversarial example within distance epsilon of x.\n\nWhy is clean test accuracy better than clean training accuracy in Figure 2. Naively training should be better?"
