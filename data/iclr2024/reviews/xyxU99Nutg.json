UnMix-TNS innovatively recalibrates instance-wise statistics within BN by mixing them with multiple unmixed components, simulating an i.i.d. environment. This method is adaptable to various state-of-the-art test-time adaptation strategies and seamlessly integrates with pre-trained architectures that include BN layers. The approach is empirically validated across diverse scenarios and shows promise in effectively handling data with temporal correlations. New datasets have also been introduced."

Multiple target domains: One of the claimed contribution is that UnMix-TNS has robustness when tested on continual domain and mixed domain. However, I am very confused which part of UniMix-TNS is designed for and beneficial to these multi-domain settings, especially the mixed domain setting. Considering that there is a new batch containing images from different domains, although different images may correspond to different UnMix-TNS components, they are finally normalized with the same mean and variance according to Eq (11). It seems like UnMix-TNS still treat multiple target domains as one single target domain. \n2. Unclear experimental setting and unsatisfactory performance: The author claimed that they follow the protocol outlined in (Lim et al., 2023). However, the performance for most of the baselines are significantly worse than the results in (Lim et al., 2023). Also, the proposed UnMix-TNS fails to outperform \u201cSource\u201d in mixed domains. I believe the comparison to baselines only makes sense if the test-time normalization is beneficial.
