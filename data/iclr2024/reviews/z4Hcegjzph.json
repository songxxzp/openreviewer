According to my understanding, the ROP strategy randomly discards some local (not global) patterns during corruption as shown in Fig. 9. This is very similar to MIM. So, I can't intuitively catch what results in the superiority of ROP in the field of MIM. It would be better to have a discussion in the paper."

This procedure relies on two auxiliary variables of $h$ and $s$. Is it possible to directly sample from {-1, 0, 1} for each entry of $P$?\n\n2. Following question 1, the projection matrix $P$ is composed of {-1, 0, 1}. Generally speaking, \"0\" denotes discarding some embed patch in projection.

While the masked image modeling, e.g. masked autoencoder, has recently shown very promising performance in self-supervised learning for visual pre-training, the authors aim to improve it by proposing a new image modeling. Specifically, unlike the masked image modeling applying random crops to the input and learning to recover the masked inputs with an encoder-decoder network, this paper considers a random orthogonal projection modeling which uses a random subspace for the projection and then learns to recover the complement of that subspace. Provided experiments show that the proposed random orthogonal projection can yield better performance than the crop-based masking."
