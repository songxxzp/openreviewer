                "value": "In the presented work, the authors propose two methods for solving the multimeric rigid protein docking problem. Especially the extension of prior work for *multimeric* docking is interesting. The work is motivated by game-theoretic principles for stable equilibria in potential games. The first method finds the stable equilibria by learning a surrogate model of the molecular potential that can be minimised using gradient descent. Additionally, to achieve sample diversity, the method uses multiple initialisations for the procedure. A second proposed method extends on diffusion models for rigid protein docking to allow for multimeric complexes."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Please find my detailed list of comments, ordered by section, below.\n\nWhere needed, I indicated that something might be a breaking issue. These issue will have to be either clarified or rectified before I will consider increasing my vote to accept.\n\n**Abstract**\n1. I find the abstract to be very well written and it definitely peaked my interest. \n2. One question that popped up in my mind several times while reading the abstract (and the similarities became more clear further in the paper) is the difference between the *game potential* and the *molecular potential* that defines, to some extend, the possible configurations in a physical sense. I believe that this is what the paper refers to with \"physics-based energy function\", but this was slightly confusing.\n\n\n**Introduction:**\n1. The first two paragraphs of the introduction are very well written and do a great job introducing the problem setting and the innovation of the paper. \n2. As indicated above, I believe the paper does not properly set out the relation between the potential function, in game theoretic sense, and the molecular potential. This issue pops up in the third paragraph of the introduction where the paper mentions that the \"final assembly structure(s) constitute stable equilibria\". The paper should relate the stable equilibria, in the game theoretic sense, with meta-stable states of the protein-protein complexes. \n3. When the author mention \"a differentiable analogue of traditional (and black-box) physics-based scoring function\" they should make clear that this refers to the an empirical force field. \n4. In the introduction the paper should cite the original Diffusion model papers in the last paragraph before listing the contributions. \n\n**Related Work**\n1. Ketara et al., which introduced the DiffDock-pp method, generates an ensemble of possible complexes. This makes the method very similar to the proposed method in the sense that they both are able to compute multiple equilibria. I understand that Ketara et al. do introduce a method to rank these, but by definition it is able to define a distribution of samples. This similarity should be made more clear in the related work discussion of this work. \n\n**Preliminaries and Background**\n1. The problem definition is very well written and adds a lot to the readability and clarity of the paper. \n2. I would like to ask the authors to clarify the cost function / potential introduced in the paragraph title \"Game Theoretic Concepts\". From my understanding, a potential function (or as the authors first call it, a cost function) is an abstraction of the payoff function, and as such, should really be defined as a function over the current states of the agent. It is possible to define the potential function using sequences of actions, or strategies, but this is only possible with a fixed starting state. Importantly, when introducing the used potential function in section 4.2, it is, in contrast to the original background discussion, actually defined over the state space (in the form of protein point clouds). This confusion is a breaking issue at the moment and should be clarified. \n3. In general, the section introducing the Game-Theoretic Concepts highlights to me that the Game-theoretic aspects of the proposed method is not very strong. As it stands, the paper does not relate the potential function, in the game theoretic sense, to the molecular potential and does thus not show that the stable equilibria, in the game-theoretic sense, are related to local minima of the molecular potential. In general, as highlighted more clearly, the game theory aspect could be taken out completely by clearly stating that the potential f is a learned approximation of the true molecular potential. \n4. For the definition of the time-reversal, the definition here should be kept consistent with the forward process by defining it as $$ d\\mathbf{x} = [f(\\mathbf{x, t}) - g(t)^2\\nabla_\\mathbf{x} \\log p_t(\\mathbf{x})]dt +g(t)d\\bar{w}$$ where $\\bar{w}$ is the time-reversed Wiener process. This is also the formulation used in the Diffusion model papers cited elsewhere in the paper. It is important that the distribution $p$ is uniquely defined for every $t$. \n5. Talking about the cited diffusion model papers, the introduction in the\" Diffusion Generative Models\" paragraph is very minimal (eg. it does not introduce the score matching objective used). To make the paper more accessible, the authors should add some of the papers cited in later sections of the paper here. \n\n**Method**\n1. When discussing multimeric protein docking, the authors should be careful that they clarify that we are talking about the *rigid* version of this problem. In the current version of the paper this is not always clarified. \n2. When stating \"Previous models tackle this [..]\" the paper should include citations to the specific previous methods that do this. \n3. As mentioned before, when the paper mentions just above starting section 4.1 \"game equilibria, i.e. stable outcomes from which no agent has an incentive to deviate\", the paper should justify that this is a correct objective to aim for by showing, formally, that these game equilibria are located at local minima of the molecular potential landscape. \n5. In the second paragraph of section 4.1 the authors state \"we do not have access to the underlying game potential f\" and while this is true to some extend (using DFT at this scale is not possible) we do have very good approximations available in the form of empirical force fields. This misunderstanding becomes more clear in section 4.2 where the authors introduce their gradient-based learning with surrogate potentials. It is unclear to me why the authors require the training of a surrogate model and don't use the energy minimisation functionality from Rosetta to find the equilibria for the randomly initialised proteins. This is a breaking issue for me and should be clarified by the authors in their response. \n6. The last paragraph of section 4.1 helps a lot in the formalisation of the proposed methods. I applaud the authors for taking the space to carefully introduce their notation. \n7. A second breaking issue in this section is the formulation of the loss function used to train the surrogate model. My observation here is that while the use of the ranking loss retains relative ordering of the different sampled complexes in terms of energy, it does not accurately reflect the gradient of the energy surface. This limits the applicability of the method for deriving of thermodynamical properties in possible downstream applications due to possible oversampling of high energy complexes. Since deriving thermodynamical properties is not an objective of the paper, this is a not necessary an breaking issue, however, it does conflict with a later statement in the discussion paragraph of section 4.2 where the paper states \"$f_\\theta$ can also be used beyond equilibrium computation e.g. to characterise the associated energy landscape (...)\". \n8. The paper states \"in case of general-sum games more sophisticated update rules could be employed [...]\", i'm unsure how this translates to the problem at hand. I would appreciate it if the authors could include an example of how the protein docking problem could be defined as a general-sum game. Similarly, i'm unsure what the physical realisation of adding penalty terms for each protein would be as the authors discuss in the discussion of this section. \n9. In section 4.3 the paper states \"An equivalent characterization of the assembly structures is interpreting them as sample(s) from the mode(s) of the Gibbs distribution\". This highlights my concern with the game-theoretic framework. The target docked complexes are *exactly* the modes of the Gibbs distribution if we defined f to be the molecular potential.\n10. Section 4.3 is really well written. \n11. In section 4.4 the paper switch from using $\\mathbf{H}$ to $\\mathbf{A}$ for referring to the residues features. Personally, I find this switch confusing and would like to ask the authors to clarify why this change was made. While using H was well defined, using A for the features conflicts with the notation of the agents actions. \n12. The architecture definition clarifies that graphs are used to model the interactions between both the residues of the same and different proteins. Considering that the paper focusses on *rigid* docking, I'm unsure why we need internal interactions. It would be great if the authors could clarify their reasoning regarding this. \n\n**Experiments**\n1. Am I correct in assuming that DIPS was only used for training the model and not for evaluation? In the \"Datasets\" paragraph the paper mentions \"We use the same splits for the DIPS and DB5.5 datasets as Gana et al. for our experiments\", but I don't see any evaluation of the DIPS dataset. \n2. For the comparison with DiffDock-PP. Given that a similar manifold diffusion model is used, how considerable is the difference between the proposed model and DiffDock-PP? And related, does that difference explain the difference we see between DockGame -SM and DiffDock-PP?\n4. For table 1, due to the large amount of model evaluated, it is hard to compare the differences. It would be beneficial if the authors could highlight the best scores for each metric. \n5. Also related to table 1, based on the presented standard deviations, it seems like all methods very much overlap in their scores. Alternatively, I could see understand that the standard deviation refers to the samples in the filtered set of the predicted assemblies, but in that case I do not understand how that works for the C-RMSD score.  It would be good if the authors could comment on this. \n6. Related, for the TM-Score cutoff of 0.05, it would be good if the paper could comment on how this relates to the identification of the different meta-stable states. If this threshold is set such that all accepted samples are from the same meta-stable state, I would expect all accepted samples to be exactly the same as the only source of stochasticity is the complex initialisation. \n7. Related to the previous comment about the diversity of the accepted samples, the authors state \"an exciting avenue for future work would be to explores ways to assess the plausibility of multiple generated equilibria, which is currently lacking\". I strongly believe that looking at the sample diversity should be already addressed in the present paper. This is a breaking issue for me as there is currently no way to assess their contribution regarding the use of sampling multiple equilibria. For this purpose I would expect at-least a qualitative visual exploration, but a quantitative exploration of the diversity would be preferred."

                "value": "This paper models multimeric protein docking as a cooperative game. Specifically, each protein is a game member and they need to cooperate for multimeric docking. The reward is minimize some potential functions. Because the physical potential function is typically expensive to compute, they use two approaches to estimate true potential. one is learning a surrogate game potential from data generated by pyrosetta, the another is learning from data via diffusion generative model. The overall idea is interesting. i like this paper. However, the performance of this method is worse than baselines. This limitation makes this paper not ready to publish currently."

What's performance without any filtering or ranking by model's potential.\n\n- It's interesting to show the distribution of decoy quality and the sampling efficient.\n\n- although alphafold-multimer already used data in test, i think it's necessary to curate a new small data set from latest PDB. alphafold-multimer is a strong baseline.\n\n- in the section of \"Equilibrium Computation via Gradient-Based Learning\", filtering decoys by Euclidean distance only could not be sufficient. i am not sure how noisy is the training data if you only use this filter. i guess this heuristic approach could limit the performance of DOCKGAME-E (DOCKGAME-E is worse than DOCKGAME-SM from table 1)\n\n\nmissing some key references:\n\n[1] Bryant, Patrick, et.al.
