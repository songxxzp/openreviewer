                "value": "This paper proposes sum-product-set networks (SPSN), a tractable probabilistic model for tree-structured data. Interestingly, the structure of the tree and dimensionality of the data is assumed to be random rather than fixed. This is achieved through the use of random feature sets (RFS), which allows for the specification of distributions over sets of varying length taking value in some domain. RFS are integrated with Sum-Product Networks (SPN) through the use of a schema/template for the data, which hierarchically specifies the fixed parts of the tree structure (heterogenous nodes) and the variable parts (homogenous nodes). Under some (strong) assumptions on the set unit distributions and the query, inference is shown to be tractable in SPSNs. Empirical results show that the classification performance is slightly worse than, but competitive with, approaches based on neural networks."

Such data structures naturally arise in many areas, such as XML/JSON, scientific domains, natural language (e.g. syntax trees), and relational data. The proposed solution, SPSNs, are a well-designed variant of sum-product networks that utilizes random features sets (set units) to allow tree nodes to have a random number of children while maintaining tractability.\n\n- Novel and adept application of RFS theory to deep tractable model architectures (SPNs). This enables the specification of distributions over hierarchical random trees.\n- The work could have significant impact in pushing the application of TPMs towards new domains, such as natural language processing. \n- The clarity and technical quality of the paper is excellent. In particular, Figure 2 was very useful for understanding the role of sum, product and set units in relation to the tree schema."

It seems the structure of the SPSN is fixed (Pg 4.), but how are the parameters learned? Is the cardinality distribution learned, and if so, how is it parameterized?\n- Is there any technical reason why the SPSN architecture cannot be extended to DAG, rather than tree structured data? \n- The related work section is thorough, but, especially considering that the tested datasets all come from a relational schema, it would be useful to better understand the relationship with relational SPNs. For example, how does one translate a relational schema to a tree schema as in Figures 4-11 (in what way is relational data \"a particular form of graph-structured data\")?\n- It is not clear what the result is in Proposition 2 (the statement seems more like a definition)."

If so, is one theoretical conclusion that there is an expressivity gap between PCs with and without set units?\n\n- The authors only remark in passing that the infinite sum required to evaluate the set unit reduces to a finite one in practice; an argument upon which their tractability results hold.

One can use logical circuits to induce distributions over many different structured objects such as paths in a grid, hierarchies of classes, preferences, as well as subsets of size $k$ [2, 3, 4]. One can then learn the parameters of such a distribution from the data. It might very well be the case that the distribution over tree-structured graphs does not admit a tractable circuit, but such an assertion seems to be absent from the paper.\n\n- Could you please explain what a schema is? I understand how one could obtain a schema from a tree-structured graph, but aside from the definition, I was hoping for an intuitive explanation. ( I am familiar with the term in the context of databases, which does not seem to translate? )\n\n- Am I correct in my understanding that, according section, set units only apply to homogeneous nodes?\n\n- I really would've like to see a (toy) complete example of an SPSN. Could you please provide such an example?\n\n- Assumption 1 (Requirements on the set unit) \"states that the cardinality distribution vanishes for a sufficiently large $m$\", What exactly do you mean by that? As a follow up, am I correct in understanding that the elements of the set are independent given the cardinality? i.e. we do not consider the statistical correlations between the elements of a set? ~To me this consequently puts into questions the tractability of SPSNs laid out in proposition 1.~\n\n- Could you please say more regarding Definition 5? What structural constraint is being imposed here exactly? To me, \"follow only a single child of each sum unit\" reads as determinism?\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] On probabilistic inference by weighted model counting. Mark Chavira, Adnan Darwiche.

Moreover, it might be helpful to the manuscript to compare the results with recent works, such as the ones discussed in Section 4.\n* Paper presentation\n    - The writing is unclear between PCs and SPNs, as the title evokes SPNs while the text uses PCs. The authors should clarify the difference between the two or assume interchangeable usage under assumptions.\n    - It could be beneficial to discuss the differences between SPNs and SPSn sooner in the paper, as it is a key contribution of the work.
