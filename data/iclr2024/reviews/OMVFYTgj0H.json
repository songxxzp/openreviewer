                "value": "This paper proposed a continual reinforcement learning approach by reweighing Bellman targets under the sequential multitask setting where the algorithm has the goal of learning one Q-function for all tasks. The paper first defined a notion of catastrophic forgetting and studied the form of the optimal solution that weighted averages over the previous optimal Q functions. Following the average form, the paper proposed a weighted Bellman target algorithm and discussed how to find the weight considering two principles: stability and plasticity. The paper then conducted simulation studies on grid-world and tabular MDPs."

I think this is a too trivial setting to study. Many papers in the literature have studied more comprehensive setups where the algorithms either try to adaptively memorize tasks or maintain different Q functions for tasks that are too discrepant. \n\nThe theoretical analysis is trivial and not fruitful. The theorem 1 in section 4.1 is a direct application of the previous work and the main message is simply that fine-tuning can quickly adapt to the current task, thus, forgetting about the previous ones. Proposition 1 though seems to be interesting lacks further discussion (see my questions for detailed discussion).\n\nThe connection between the practical algorithm defined in 5.1 and the optimal solution defined in 4.2 needs to be more formally discussed. The paper considers a setting, where we want to find one global Q that works well in all MDPs. It is obvious that the optimal solution should take certain form of weighted optimal Q_t\u2019s. What is special in equation (5) is that this weight is given by an equation with special form. I don\u2019t see this being carried to the design of the practical algorithms. In the current form, the theory and the practical algorithm are rather irrelevant. \n\nThe writings have to be improved too. There are multiple typos and undefined notations."

Most importantly, while the presented approach of MDPs difference appears very good, it is presented without alternatives, which are certainly easy to come by. It seems that the focus on difference between follow-up MDPs naturally implies the properties that are later derived. A comparison of various metrics at this point would have probably made a nice paper on its own.\n\nThe convergence analysis of the baseline algorithms seems uninteresting, when they are outperformed in the later study.\n\nThe experiments come with a warning regarding their small scale, which should be noted. But at this scale, it is hard to see them as more as just a sanity check on the analytical approach. What happens when the MDPs are more different than the very small variations presented? Can a changed state/action structure be accounted for somehow or is it remaining fixed integral to the approach?\n\nMinor notes:\n- p1. \"it suggest\" without any it being referred to.\n- p2. \"it is less studied about\" makes no sense to me as a sentence.\n- p3.
