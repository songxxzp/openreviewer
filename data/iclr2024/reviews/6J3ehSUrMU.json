The FedDA method works by aggregating interpolations (i.e. weighted averages) of the target domain gradient and the source domain gradients. The FedGP method further projects the source gradient onto the \"positive direction\" of the domain gradient before interpolation (i.e. zeroing out conflicting directions). The interpolation factor for each domain is chosen such that the $L^\\pi$ distance between the source and target gradients is minimized w.r.t. some prior $\\pi$ on the parameters. The authors show that this error can be decomposed as a noise term of the target domain and a distance term between the source and the target domains. The optimal interpolation factor would then balance the source and target gradients based on those terms, which can be estimated during training in a scheme called auto_weight. Extensive experiments show the benefits of this approach."

However, we do not see experiments showing the effect of data scarcity on the robustness of the performance of FedGP vs. FedAvg, for example.\n- Personalized federated learning algorithms are relevant for comparison, but I think that direct comparison of such algorithms with FedGP might put them at a disadvantage since they are not specifically designed for domain generalization. ColoredMNIST, VLCS, and TerraIncognita datasets are more concerned with shifts in p(x) or p(x|y), whereas personalized FL is more concerned with shifts in p(y) and p(y|x), i.e. personalizing the prediction rather than adapting to spurious correlations or invariant attributes. You should either choose federated datasets for comparison, or you should compare your algorithm to domain generalization algorithms, e.g. IRM and others. Or why not use a hospital dataset that fits the setting you described in the paper? For example, you can consider FLamby [2].\n- One work [1] from federated continual learning might be of interest (which even shares the same name FedGP). It is motivated from a similar intuition, which is to remove from the gradient its projection onto the negative direction of the reference gradient.\n- In algorithm 1, the auto_weight scheme requires intermediate gradients for each domain, which might require a lot of memory.\n\n[1] FedGP: Buffer-based Gradient Projection for Continual Federated Learning.
