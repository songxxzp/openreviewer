                "value": "- At the end of the \"Related Work\" (section 4) the author mentioned: \"Thirdly, the model\u2019s performance is not benchmarked against other SOTA models with high predictive capacity, such as LightGBM or XGBoost\" by state of the art here does the authors refer specificly to PROTAC research or for general ML and DL applications? since claiming that LightGBM and XGBoost are the best as predictive models is too generic and is not true with the presence of different advanced neural network architectures like transformers and attention models. \n \n - In section 5.2, the authors mentioned about the oversampling that they applied on the minoriy class and I quote: \"For class balance, oversampling and SMILES randomization were applied to minority class entries in the training datasets.\" however they did not specify the type of oversampling/data augmentation algorithm or logic that was leveraged for this purpose, was it some random duplication? SMOTE oversampling algorithm? and if any what is the reason behind using that specific oversampling method. \n \n - At the beginning of section 5.3, the author mentioned the following:\" We propose a general model architecture for predicting degradation activity of PROTAC complexes. This architecture involves joining (either summing or concatenating) embeddings from different model branches\". So did the authors applied a suming or a concatenation to assemble the different embeddings?\n \n - Still in section 5.3, the authors talked about how they generated the embeddings derived from SMILES, they mentioned the approach with MLP, GNN and BERT, However later on in the experimental comparison they compared those three to XGBoost, so was XGBoost also used to extract representations from SMILES, if so how was it done? If not what is the reason behind comparing it to MLP, GNN and BERT? \n \n - I do not quite understand the reason behind writing section 7.3, isn't it somehow obvious that a dummy model will have a good accuracy but a bad F1-score since it naively classifies the majority class? \n  \n- Concerning section 7.6 about Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, could the authors provide the amount of domain shift happening between the train and test data? This would be helpful to quantitatively grasp the gap between the 2 sets and thus observe how generalizable is the approach towards OOD."

However, the utilized model architectures and molecular representations are established techniques in drug discovery. A comparative discussion on how this study's data curation advances beyond existing methodologies such as those in DeepPROTACs would be beneficial.\n\n**Quality**: The dataset curation and model implementation demonstrate rigor, but the evaluation lacks a thorough examination of generalizability to out-of-distribution data. The validation accuracy is on par with certain benchmarks but does not reach the latest advancements in PROTAC prediction.\n\n**Clarity**: The manuscript is articulate in method and result description. Nonetheless, it could benefit from a more detailed discussion on dataset balancing and optimization strategies. The section on limitations requires expansion to provide a deeper insight.\n\n**Significance**: The toolkit has the potential to facilitate open PROTAC research; however, its impact might be limited by the conventional nature of the modeling techniques employed. The real value for the field appears to be in the datasets provided, despite the datasets being variations of the same data compilation.\n\nThe paper, as it stands, may not meet the innovation and impact criteria for a premier ML conference.

Incorporating explicit modeling of PROTAC-target engagement may be advantageous.\n\n**Organization**: The first four sections display redundancy, with overlap in the introduction, background, and contributions.

The authors collect and standardize data from two existing open-source datasets, PROTAC-DB and PROTAC-Pedia, which contain structural and experimental data of PROTAC complexes. The paper organizes the curated data into 16 datasets incorporating essential features such as pDC50, Dmax, E3 ligase type, POI amino acid sequence, and experimental cell type. This work provides an open-source toolkit that includes a configurable PyTorch dataset class, a customizable machine-learning model, and a hyperparameter optimization mechanism.

This type of fit does not accurately estimate DC50 or Dmax because of the hook effect. A fit similar to that proposed by Haid et al (https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics15010195) is preferred.\n\nThe paper could benefit from additional experiments that evaluate the models on more diverse and challenging datasets, such as those specific to a congeneric series or those with different E3 ligase types and POI amino acid sequences.\n\nThe work focuses on predicting protein degradation efficacy using machine learning models. However, the paper does not address other important aspects of PROTAC engineering, such as pharmacokinetics, toxicity, or other ADMET properties.
