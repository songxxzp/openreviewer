                "value": "i) Computing the basis using private dataset compromises privacy, as the basis is directly depending on the private data. Although the authors argue that this can be considered as tuning hyperparameters, such an argument is unconvincing. In particular, this work does not conserve privacy for basic hyperparameter-tuning such as learning rate. Compared to related works or baselines, the proposed method definitely loses more privacy .\n\nii) The authors claim to focus on smaller public datasets due to computational resource limitations. For instance, instead of pre-training a network in CIFAR100, a batch of CIFAR100 data is selected for the projected DP-SGD. However, this argument seems weak. In my experience, projected DP-SGD is resource -intensive due to the basis calculation and gradient matrix storage. I suspect that conducting PEFT on the entire CIFAR100 dataset followed by vanilla PEFT DP-SGD could be faster and yield better results. This raises questions about the motivation and necessity of devising such a multi-stage training pipeline. The authors could conduct some additional experiments and provide details on running time, memory usage and configurations to justify the merits of their framework.\n\niii) The best utility gains reported in the experiments are primarily achieved when the private dataset is used as the public dataset. This result is trivial and does not demonstrate the necessity of employing GSD. Additionally, only a limited number of candidates are reported in each experiment, making it is unclear whether the GSD order is aligned well with the actual utility gain.\n\niv) Most of the utility gains are marginal. I also note the reported results are poor given that the networks are pre-trained. Specifically, the best results of CIFAR10 and FMNIST are worse than or only comparable to some basic baselines, e.g. [1].  Although the original paper of this baseline does not report the results of $\\epsilon=2$, the authors can run its code to verify this.\n\n[1] Tramer & Boneh, DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE LEARNING NEEDS BETTER FEATURES (OR MUCH MORE DATA), 2021."

                "value": "The paper considers finding good representative subspaces for the gradients of loss functions when training ML models using sensitive data. In particular, these gradient subspaces are obtained by evaluating the gradients using public data. The background for this: DP-SGD introduces lot of noise and degrades the model performance as the parameter dimension grows. To this end, certain projection method have been introduced (e.g., Yu et al., 2021) where an orthogonal projector is used such that the DP-noise is added only in the projected space, reducing the total expected 2-norm of the injected DP-noise from $O(\\sqrt{d})$ to $O(\\sqrt{k})$, where $d$ is the parameter space dimension and $k$ the dimension of the projection subspace. Then, the problem is, how to obtain a good basis for the projector. Doing this privately is challenging, and a natural choice is to use public data for this. Then the question is, which public data set to use, so that the basis would well represent the subspace where the sensitive gradients live. This paper proposes a certain metric, \"Projection Metric\", to evaluate the goodness of the projector obtained with the public data. This metric is studied both theoretically and experimentally. Another related contribution is to consider \"second phase pre-training\", where a public data pre-trained large model is fine-tuned with another public data by having a small number of trainable parameters, and then the \"Projection Metric\" can be used to select best possible public dataset for this second phase pre-training, in case we use some projection method in the final fine-tuning with the sensitive data."

I think these questions are related to these projection methods in general, but of course are directly related to using this projection metric also. I don't really see it discussed anywhere, in the appendix either. Suppose I use that second phase pre-training such that I DP fine-tune LoRa parameters using some public dataset. There would be some $O(10^4)$ parameters, let's say there are 40k of them. And the public dataset size would be, let's say $O(10^5)$. Wouldn't computing the $V_{public}$ using SVD be quite expensive in this case? Or should I somehow limit the number of trainable parameters, the public dataset size, or use stochastic approximations to obtain $V_{public}$, or some other approximative numerical methods? As far as I see, one should update $V_{public}$ quite frequently? How frequently? I am just trying to think of a practical scenario, and what would one need to take into account when using these projection methods and this projection metric. E.g., when I compare public datasets, which one to use for construction the projector, should I just take some random subsets of them as candidates and would that be sufficient?\n\n-  Overall, I think the presented ideas are intuitive and I believe useful but on theoretical level the contribution is not big, the value is on the experimental side.
