                "value": "This paper focuses on making in-context learning (ICL) with LLMs more efficient and effective. Vanilla ICL requires one to provide a collection of demonstrations, i.e., task-specific example-label pairs, as context to the LLM while running an inference for a test example. However, this leads to long input sequences, increasing the cost of inference with LLMs where the self-attention cost scales quadratically with input sequence length. This paper proposes to utilize a **demonstration distillation model** to compress the long demonstration sequence into a small number of vectors which can be fed into the LLM as a prompt vector (akin to prompt tuning) during inference. There are existing approaches that adopt such an approach to make ICL efficient. However, those approaches often result in performance degradation. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-based approach to train the demonstration distillation model. Through extensive empirical evaluations, the paper shows that the resulting demonstration distillation model not only realizes efficient inference by reducing the context length for LLM but often also improves the performance compared to vanilla ICL."

Similarly, why is vanilla ICL (with truncated demonstration) missing from Figure 4b?\n5) On page 8, the paper states ``Moreover, it is noteworthy that performance improves in most cases when the No Input perturbation is applied.

In fact, authors acknowledge this limitation in the appendix; I simply believe that having experiments on larger models (for example, training only one distillation model and applying it to larger LMs) would increase the impact of the work.\n* The inference efficiency measurement protocol could likely be improved. First, it is unclear whether key/value caching is used for generation: this should make the impact of additional demonstrations less severe. Also, I think it would be helpful to have a more detailed memory/time breakdown for MEND: measuring only the inference with obtained meta-demonstrations is not sufficient, as the distillation model needs to process input demonstrations into prompts.\n* At times, it was a bit difficult to understand the reasoning of the paper due to grammar errors/typos and word choice. Consider, for examplem, \"the evident an misalignment\" and \"between teacher student's\" on page 2, \"into a condensed vectors\", \"distill the supervisional from demonstrations\", and \"cannot leveraging\" on page 5."
