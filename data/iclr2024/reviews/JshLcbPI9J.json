However, structural causal equations are unknown, and often impossible to figure out solely based on data [1].\nMy question to authors regarding this: `How can we get access to structural causal equations underlying our data? How do we ensure identifiability of such equations given observed data?` I will reconsider my score if authors provide a convincing answer.\n\nSome thoughts regarding this matter: Although authors assume access to underlying generation mechanisms, my guess is that this assumption might not be necessary. identifiability of backtracking counterfactuals seems easier than identifiability of interventional counterfactuals, and we might not need access to generation mechanisms for them. This is just my intuition, and not rigorous.\n\n[1] [Counterfactual Non-identifiability of Learned Structural Causal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09031)"

I enclosing $x^*$ with parentheses will help the reader.\n3. Why does the title of section 3 contain the word `Deep`? I think your formulation as a constrained optimization is not limited to deep neural networks.\n4. In the first line of section 3, why do you use the word `example`? I thought counterfactual explanations explained in the former section are just an application of backtracking counterfactuals. If that is the case, I don't think you should use them when explaining your general formulation.\n5. I beleive F should be changed to $F^{-1}$ in the end of equation (4).\n6. What is $Y$ in the footnote of page 4? I don't think it's mentioned anywhere else in the text.\n7. How computationally expensive is calculating the Jacobian esp. for high-dimensional generation mechanisms such as those of images? Can you provide some numbers? I think this is important esp. for practitioners as you may need many Jacobian calculations for your method to converge.\n8. How many iterations does it take for Algorithm 1 to converge? Can you provide some ballparks?\n9. How did you choose $\\lambda=10^4$? How should we choose it for a new domain?

                "value": "The paper is well written and easy to follow. It combines the idea of backtracking counterfactuals with the deep SCM framework to tackle the problem of counterfactual estimation. The paper is sound and shows convincing results of the differences between interventional and backtracking counterfactuals in high-dimensional settings."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper is a relatively simple combination of [1] and [2] and it is unclear how important the linearisation of the optimisation procedure is for the performance of the counterfactuals: How well would simple SGD perform? Is the optimisation over u* converging or simply stopped after 30 iterations?\nFrom my understanding, the DeepBC algorithm is limited to handle continuous variables and it is unclear how the choice of distance metric would influence the resulting counterfactuals in case of u's with different dimensionalities along the backtracking trace. Additional ablations comparing the different design choices would strengthen the paper.\nAdditionally, I would encourage the authors to consider adding quantitative evaluations such as proposed by [3].\n\nGenerally, it feels like this paper tries to introduce DeepBC as a combination of [1] and [2], while being a counterfactual explanation paper. I am not sure which of the two it really ends up being. Furthermore, the use of the DSCM framework could be highlighted more.\n\n[3] Monteiro, Miguel, et al. \"Measuring axiomatic soundness of counterfactual image models.\" The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2022."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- I saw in the code that the autoencoders use a simple MSE loss without properly modelling the observational noise. Why is this choice made?\n- In eq 7 you use an L2 penalty for the distance in latent space. This is very restrictive and would only sensibly work for continuous noise variables.:\n  - What's the impact on that if the variables have different noise dimensions?\n  - How would this generalise to discrete variables?\n  - This does not use any scaling between the variables. In footnote 2, it is mentioned that this isn't necessary because they all assume the same base distribution. I believe this point should be elevated beyond a footnote as it might be lost to readers otherwise.\n- You mention that you approximate $F_s$ at $\\bar{u}$. Is this correct? What is $\\bar{u}$ in this case?\n- Why do you use the linearisation? Is this faster than SGD? Did you compare the two?\n- Why do we want to enforce sparse changes in $u$? Is this sparse in the dimensions of all u or sparse in the different variables?\n- You mention that interventional CF can generate samples in low-density regions and mention it as a weakness. Why is that? Isn't that actually one of the strengths in terms of disentanglement and generalisation?\n- You mention that you're using standardized logits for modelling. How do you compute them? What's the impact of using this over discrete variables?\n- You mention the composability / modularity as a strength of your work. However, this is generally possible within any causal generative framework, particularly the DSCM framework. What's special about this work in this regard?\n- You mention you're using \"an image regressor, together with an unconditional AE ...\". Can you elaborate how this baseline works?\n- You mention that DeepBC does not properly sample from the counterfactual distribution and it didn't yield satisfactory results. Why is that? What were the results?\n- As for CF explanations, how does this compare to explaining anti-causal predictions by using causal generative models (e.g. see [4]).\n\n[4] Zhang, Cheng, Kun Zhang, and Yingzhen Li. \"A causal view on robustness of neural networks.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 289-301."
