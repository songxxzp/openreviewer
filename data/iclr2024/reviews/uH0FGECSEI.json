In particular, the games tested (tic-tac-toe and connect-4) are not large enough in order to make solid conclusions regarding the scalability of the method. It would be much more convincing if the authors used this new formulation to make progress on benchmarks that are otherwise elusive using prior techniques. Overall, I believe that the paper would significantly benefit from having more experiments and on larger benchmarks. It would also expect the adversarial formulation to capture partially observable settings (such as Poker); I do not see any significant obstacles in extending the methodology to partially observable settings. Such extensions would significantly strengthen the contributions of the paper. Besides those issues with the experiments, the other concern is that the new formulations are relatively straightforward, and there is not much conceptual or algorithmic novelty in deriving them based on earlier approaches. Overall, although the results are promising, they seem to be in a rather preliminary stage."

                "value": "- It is mentioned that \"We propose expected flow networks, ... generalizing GFlowNets on tree-structured state spaces.\" In the simpler case of trees instead of non-tree DAGs, why don't you just apply maximum entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL) approaches? It has been extensively demonstrated in previous GFlowNets papers that when the DAG degenerates to a tree, it is indeed equivalent to MaxEnt RL approaches (e.g., Soft Q-learning), which can natually handle stochastic worlds. Therefore, it makes little sense for only EFlowNets to be only evaluated in tree-structured state spaces.\n\n- The performance and explanation of EFlowNets does not make sense. As described in the paper, this paper aims to extend (Pan et al., 2023; Bengio et al., 2023) to handle more general cases considering stochasticity in the transition dynamics, i.e., extend GFlowNets -- which aims to sample proportionally to a reward function $R(x)$, i.e., $\\pi(x) \\propto R(x)$, to the settings with stochastic transition dynamics.\nHowever, the solution learned by EFlowNets is incorrect as demonstrated in Figure 1(a). Although it is able to solve $p$ (with a solution of around $0.66$) in this case while $p$ cannot find satisfiable solutions in Stoch-GFlowNets, it leads to sampling $x1$ with probability $p(x_1) \\approx 0.33 \\neq 2/10$, $p(x_2) \\approx 0.33 \\neq 3/10$, $p(x_3) \\approx 0.306 \\neq 1/10$, and $p(x_2) \\approx 0.034 \\neq 4/10$. Although $p$ is solvable in EFlowNets, the learned sampling policy fails to realize the goal of GFlowNets (sampling proportionally from the reward function), and learns a meaningless sampling policy. Consequently, EFlowNets do not address the limitations of Stoch-GFlowNets in some cases where satisfiable solutions are unavailable. However, this claim is made throughout the paper, which is an overstatement in this context.\n\n- The statement seems incorrect -- \"Stochastic GFlowNets directly apply the training algorithms applicable to deterministic GFlowNets (e.g., DB) to the augmented DAG $G$, with the only modification being that the forward policy $P_F$ is free to be learned only on agent edges, while on environment edges it is fixed to the transition function.\" In stochastic environments, the transitions dynamic is unknown, and after I checked the Stochastic GFlowNets paper, I found that it indeed learns the forward policy and the underlying transition dynamics (which is not fixed, unknown and is learned by experiences).\n\n- In the \"Violated desiderata in stochastic GFlowNets\" section, a very important property is missed (which is satisfied by Stochastic GFlowNets with solvable cases but EFlowNets unfortunately violated) -- the correct sampling behavior, which means that GFlowNets function well in stochastic environments which sample proportionally to the reward function. Failures to satisfy this basic and fundamental requirement will lead to meaningless solutions. \n\n- EFlowNets bear great similarity to (Yang et al., 2023), however, the latter aims to extend Decision Transformer to stochastic environments in the realm of RL. Taking the expectation is correct in RL, since the objective of RL is to maximized the expected discounted future rewards. In addition, EFlowNets also bear similarity to Section 3.3.2 about stochastic rewards in (Bengio et al., 2023), which is mentioned about stochasticity in the rewars (not the transition dynamics), which is a case studied in (Zhang et al., 2023). Therefore, it does not make sense to apply the methodology in about learning an expectation as in RL (Yang et al., 2023) to GFlowNets with the hope to tackle stochasticity in transition dynamics as discussed in (Bengio et al., 2023).\n\n- It is mentioned that trajectory balance is used for branch-adjusted AFlowNets. However, most practical games in multi-agent systems are actually partially observable (e.g., StartCraft II), which renders stochasticity in the transition dynamics. TB leads to large variance as mentioned in the text and in experiments in (Madan et al., 2023). Therefore, it seems to be more appropriate to apply this with DB or SubTB (since one of the claims for SubTB is to improve credit assignment). \n\n- It is mentioned that \"This data defines a fully observed sequential game\", which can limit its practical applicability in a wider range of applications with partial observation. \n\n- A very relevant paper extending GFlowNets to the multi-agent setting  (Li et al., 2023) is not cited and discussed. Since both paper study a very similar setting, it is worth comparing the approach with FCN and CFN in (Li et al., 2023), or at least discussed thoroughly. \"Generative Multi-Flow Networks: Centralized, Independent and Conservation. Yinchuan Li, Haozhi Wang, Shuang Luo, Yunfeng Shao, Jianye Hao. 2023.\"\n\n- It is unclear why experiments in Section 4.1 employ very large $\\beta=10, 30$ which is different from (Jain et al., 2022), which leads to the case of a tree with very peaky rewards. In addition, it is worth investigating how the approach behave under the traditional $L_1$ error metric, which measures how well EFlowNets learn compared with other approaches.\n\n- Why the two-play games correspond to a tree instead of a graph? There can be many parent states for a state actually."
