However, there are some major concerns I have that would be great to address in the next revision.\n\n- My main suggestion, *highly recommended*, is for the authors to include in the main text a list of the differences from TDMPC. There will be many readers (like myself) who are familiar with TDMPC, and we'd like to be able to understand the differences at a glance. The way the paper is currently written, the authors have described the full algorithm from first principles, but this mixes together their contributions versus TDMPC's contributions. At best, this causes confusion, while at worst, a reader may incorrectly attribute credit for an idea to this paper rather than the original TDMPC paper. A concrete example is the section on the planning algorithm; rather than a  vague sentence at the end saying \"Refer to [the TDMPC paper] for more details about the planning procedure\" (which hides whether or not there are any differences), it would be good to start off with a direct statement like \"The planning procedure is unchanged from [the TDMPC paper]; we re-describe it here so that this paper can be self-contained.\" Or, if there are minor changes, you can describe them candidly.\n\n- Another smaller suggestion: There are some parts of the paper that feel like too much overselling of what is ultimately a couple of modifications from TDMPC. The sentence which got me feeling this way was \"TDMPC2 marks the beginning of a new era for model-based RL\". It's great if the authors feel that way about their own work, but in a scientific paper I would prefer the language to remain neutral, and to allow the reader to form their own judgment about these matters.\n\n- I have included several smaller questions below that should be addressed in the next revision as well."

                "value": "- How does the DreamerV3 baseline work, doesn't that algorithm expect discrete action spaces (as discussed in Section 5)?\n- I'd like some clarifications on the task embeddings e. Are they just trainable vectors that get passed as input to all components of the TOLD model? What forces them to be meaningfully diverse from each other in a way that is consistent with the semantics of the tasks? Is there some extra term in the loss function for them?\n- \"minimum of two randomly sub-sampled Q-functions\" Why not just take the minimum over all 5?\n- \"reward and value prediction as a discrete regression\" Are there limitations arising from this due to the resulting lack of expressivity? Or is the discretization fine enough that a wide enough range of value functions can be effectively learned? What are the tradeoffs of increasing or decreasing the granularity of this discretization?\n- The SimNorm contribution is interesting. Is it fair to think of it as a different method of achieving the same effect as the vector-of-categoricals approach in Appendix G of the Director paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04114)?\n- \"extending TD-MPC2 to discrete action spaces remains an open problem\" What are the challenges here?"

Did it provide significant improvements compared to other commonly used activations, e.g., ReLU?\n\n2) I am not sure that it is possible to claim that MPC is a closed-loop policy, even when it considers the terminal value function at time step $H$. For instance, if Eq. (6) was maximized over a sequence of policies $(\\pi_t,...,\\pi_{t+h})$ instead of a sequence of actions $(a_{t},...,a_{t+h})$, it could result in a higher value. See Eq. (2) of [1] as an example. I believe this could lead to sub-optimal behavior in highly stochastic or multi-modal environments.\n\n3) Recently, [2] also showed performance gains via Layer Norm and Dropout. Is this related to how Layer Norm and Dropout were used on TD-MPC2? I suggest discussing these techniques in more depth.\n\n4) \u201cSAC and DreamerV3 are prone to numerical instabilities in Dog tasks\u201d. Could you elaborate on which numerical instabilities, and why TD-MPC2 can avoid them?\n\n5) \u201cAt the same time, extending TD-MPC2 to discrete action spaces remains an open problem.\u201d\nI suggest elaborating what are the challenges involved in applying TD-MPC2 on discrete action spaces.\n\nMinor:\n- Below Eq. (3), it is missing a $\\gamma$ in the TD-target $q_t = r_t + \\gamma Q$.\n\n[1] Online Planning with Lookahead Policies. Yonathan Efroni et al.
