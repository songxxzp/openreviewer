                "value": "The paper introduces VBPI-Mixtures, an algorithm designed to enhance the accuracy of phylogenetic posterior distributions, particularly for tree-topology and branch-length approximations. The paper utilizesadvanced deep learning methodologies such as normalizing flows and graph neural networks to  a leading-edge black-box variational inference (BBVI) framework, Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference (VBPI). The VBPI-Mixtures algorithm bridges this gap by harnessing the latest breakthroughs in mixture learning within the BBVI domain. As a result, VBPI-Mixtures algorithm is  capable of capturing distributions over tree-topologies that VBPI fails to model. On the experimental side, the paper empirically validates that a single-component approximation will struggle to properly model all parts\nof the target distribution when learned with black-bo. Additionally, the paper substantiates that the various mixture components cooperate to collectively encompass the target density. In addition, the paper demonstrates that the increased model flexibility and promotion of exploration translates into better marginal log-likelihood estimates and more accurate tree-topology posterior approximations."

Combining these two methods gives numerous advantages such as the ability to better model multimodal posteriors using mixtures as well as the ability to model correlations between different subsplits.\n\nThe authors have provided a mathematical derivation of the gradient update equation for their variational approximation and shown how this can be computed in a stable manner.

However, I didn't see any technical issues in going from equation 6 to equation 9.\n\nThe analysis in the experiments fail to convince an outsider to phylogenetics. I see that there is a claim of better marginal log likelihood. First of all, it is not clarified whether this improvement is observed on held-out test data.

The latter is more common in VI and the paper also seems to be using the latter since all the expectations are taken with respect to to q. In the toy example, I agree that KL(p||q) could be computed, but I would still suggest to report KL(q||p) as well.\n\nThe paper claims the following, \"Mixtures of SBNs allow for modeling correlations in the sampling of the partitions, and thus increase the flexibility of the approximation.\" Now, I understand the claim in terms of increasing the flexibility of the approximation, but I do not understand (lacking any phylogenetics background) as to why this flexibility is important in phylogenetics.
