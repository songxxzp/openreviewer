The paper mentions RL as a major component, but the MDP is not even clearly defined! How is the state defined? The paragraph on the top of page 3 does not provide any meaningful information about the specific MDP. The theorem about the smoothness of Q function is even confusing, the GNN helps estimation and generalization if i understand it correctly, and the theorem should make statement about the Q-function estimation error (in evaluation case, or the distance to Q^{*} in optimization case), instead of saying the property of Q^*, the property of Q^* is independent of how you estimate and learn the Q function.\n\n- For the offline RL perspective, there are lots of offline RL algorithms you can utilized, BCQ, IQL, i do not understand the reason of sticking with DQN, and even proposing the ARB. The ARB seems even confusing to me, how it is gonna used to adjust distribution shift? The alg box line 15 and 19 even does not match.\n\nI would suggest the paper to take some effort in the writing, at least to communicate the ideas clearly, the current stage of the paper is not ready for publish at ICLR."
