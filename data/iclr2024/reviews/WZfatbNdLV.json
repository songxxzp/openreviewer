                "value": "Modeling alternative splicing (AS) and predicting the implications of _cis_-acting factors (e.g., proximal mutations) and _trans_-acting factors (e.g., RNA binding proteins; RBPs) have been studied for almost two decades. The splicing machinery and process are complicated and error-prone, which is why a significant fraction of diseases involve aberrant splicing. In this manuscript, the authors propose two major directions: using transformers for modeling alternative splicing (referred to as Traspr) and utilizing this model as an oracle to propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) method for designing sequences that achieve a desired alternative splicing level. They employ mutation and RBP knockdown data to demonstrate that their transformer-based model has learned the regulatory code of splicing. Finally, they illustrate, by example, how their Bayesian optimization method can alter alternative splicing levels."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "This manuscript attempts to address two major problems but, unfortunately, does not succeed in either case. Here are the main issues:\n\n1. The authors focus on differential splicing and use splicing profiles across multiple tissues and species to train their model. However, they do not present any immediate benefits. For instance, they do not provide information on how much SpliceAI (Jaganathan et al., 2019) loses in performance, or how much Traspr gains, by having a universal (tissue-agnostic) model for splicing. In Section 4.1, the authors themselves acknowledge that \"[...] predictions for tissue-specific splicing changes were not very accurate, and we, therefore, did not include them here.\"\n\n2. The manuscript lacks convincing performance comparisons. It is challenging to believe that Traspr outperforms Pangolin (and subsequently SpliceAI) by such a significant margin (Spearman correlation 0.81 vs. 0.17). SpliceAI and other methods have undergone extensive testing by independent researchers. Furthermore, the approach for calculating cassette exon inclusion in Pangolin, as described in the manuscript, may not be optimal, as it ignores the upstream and downstream exon junctions. A more appropriate method can be found in the Methods section of the SpliceAI paper.\n\n3. Traspr appears to excel at predicting constitutive and non-constitutive exons but performs poorly for exons that fall in between (the truly alternatively spliced exons). It might provide more insight if the tested exons were categorized accordingly (e.g., see Fig. 1C in the SpliceAI paper).\n\n4. The manuscript lacks a comparison with the AE+MLP model, which is trained only on mouse data and is not considered state of the art.\n\n5. The authors only examine Daam1 mutations published in (Barash et al., 2010), while numerous datasets have been published since then, e.g., in (Xiong et al. 2015) and (Jaganathan et al., 2019), among many others.\n\n6. When evaluating the Bayesian optimization (BO) method for sequence design, other datasets could be considered, such as the SMA dataset in (Xiong et al. 2015).\n\nMinor Comments:\n- Not all figure panels are labeled, and some figure references are incorrect, e.g., Fig. 1b in subsection 3.1.1.\n- Some tables have two values in some cells, and it is not clear what these values represent, e.g., in Tables 1 and 2.\n- Fig. 1 is too small and challenging to read."

            "questions": {
                "value": "I find the sequence design aspect of this manuscript interesting and promising. I have a couple of questions on that:\n\n1. Is the Transformer model truly necessary here? Could the VAE be used to obtain representations and then be fed into the MLP? Essentially, could a single splice junction model be trained instead of a Transformer and a VAE?\n2. On the same topic, it would be beneficial to understand how a model like SpliceAI, followed by an MLP, would perform as the oracle. I'm not convinced that the Transformer-based splice site detection (with a 400bp context) outperforms SpliceAI with a 10kb context.\n3. Assuming that a tissue-specific splicing model works (which needs to be demonstrated), can the BO method be adapted to modify AS only in a specific tissue, such as the brain?"

Recent tools such as SpliceBERT are not mentioned.\n\nThe description of the \u201ccondition-specific\u201d nature of the method is somewhat vague, and should be described/discussed in Introduction and in the relevant Methods section in more detail. For example, it seems (pg. 3, bottom paragraph) that the method does not take condition information (RBP knockdown) on input directly, but \u201csimulates it\u201d via sequence modification.

The inputs of the network are the RNA sequences near the splicing site, meta data such as sample type (tissue), exon length, intron length, etc. The labels are the psi values quantified using another method called MAJIQ. \n\nThe goal of this manuscript is to learn the underlying regulatory mechanisms of splicing using the proposed network such that it could be used as an oracle to predict the splicing based on the sequence information and meta-data. Based on this powerful prediction capability, the authors proposes additional networks to design new RNA sequences to make them splice as expected.\n\nIn general, I think the goal is very ambitious. Unfortunately, I am not convinced by the manuscript that the goal is achieved. First, I am not sure what meta data information could be utilised to predict condition-specific splicing, assuming the input RNA sequences are from the same species thus are very similar. I feel it will be useful to give a concrete example to motivate the proposal. Second, I think it will be nice to expand the prediction part with more experiments to validate the basic assumptions. For example, if we replace the input sequences with random sequences or sequences from non-splicing genes, but with the same meta-data, we expect to see that psi is close to 0. Assuming the network has successfully captured the regulatory mechanism, we expect to see the psi will decrease to 0 if we remove the U2 elements (suppl. Fig. 7d) from the input sequences. Since the splicing mechanism is conservative between human and mouse, we expect to see that NN trained on human data should exhibit similar predictive power on mouse homolog genes. If the prediction part works with high precision, then it worth designing novel RNA sequences. It will be really helpful for me to read the ms if the authors could highlight the main ideas and assumptions and hiding unnecessary details.\n\nMinor points:\n1.
