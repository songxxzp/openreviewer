                "value": "1)\tThe author(s) claim that \u201cwe introduce two persistence point transformation methods (see Eq. 2), i.e., (i) birth-lifespan transformation and (ii) differentiable distribution transformation\u201d. These transformation methods \u201ccan transform a PD (i.e., a multi-set of persistence points) into a topological feature vector or function which can be easily integrated into any type of models\u201d. However, all the transformation methods used in the paper are just standard Betti curve, persistent landscape, and persistent image. In fact, the so called \u201cbirth-lifespan transformation and differentiable distribution transformation\u201d are just rename or summarization of existing methods. In fact, the vectorization of PD is a hot research area and various models have been proposed, including Barcode statistics, Algebraic functions and tropical functions, Binning approach, Persistent codebook, Persistent paths and signature features, 2D/3D representation, etc. Various topological kernels have also been developed. A detailed discussion of these models can be found in various review papers, such as, \nPun, Chi Seng, Kelin Xia, and Si Xian Lee. \"Persistent-Homology-based Machine Learning and its Applications--A Survey.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1811.00252 (2018). \nDey, T. K., & Wang, Y. (2022). Computational topology for data analysis. Cambridge University Press.\nZ. X. Cang, Lin Mu and Guo-Wei Wei, Representability of algebraic topology for biomolecules in machine learning based scoring and virtual screening, PLOS Computational Biology, 14(1), e100592 (2018). \nThe authors should not overclaim their contributions and properly cite the related works. \n2)\tThe author(s) state that \u201cA notable benefit of the birth-lifespan transformation is its parameter-free definition. This parameter-free Birth-lifespan transformation thus eliminates the necessity for any adjustments, negating the potential for overfitting\u201d.  This is not proper! The transformation can only generate a continuous function, which needs to be further discretized or vectorized. The size of the final topological vector depends on the the process of discretization, and it can be very large if a refined mesh or grid is used!  In contract, if Barcode statistics model or Algebraic functions are employed, the final topological vectors are always of limited sizes. In this way, they are really \u201cparameter-free\u201d. \n3)\tFigure 19 is very weird. The barcode is not consistent with the data! For instance, in the second simplicial complex (from left to right), it contains 7 0-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 0-dim barcodes is just 6! Further, in the third simplicial complex (from left to right), it also contains 7 0-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 0-dim barcodes is just 1! Moreover, it contains only 2 1-dim homology generators, but the number of the corresponding 1-dim barcodes is 3!\n4)\tPage 4, \u201cwhere $K$ denotes the maximum dimension of simplices of $x_t$\u201d. Normally the dimension of PD can be different from the highest order of simplices. \n5)\tThe citations in the paper are very messy.  For instance, Page 1, \u201cGao et al. Gao et al. propose\u201d; Page 2, \u201cLiu et al. Liu et al. (2019)\u201d\u2026"
