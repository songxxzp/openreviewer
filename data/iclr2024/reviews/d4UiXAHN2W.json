                "value": "This paper introduces the LLaMA-Adapter, a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method for large language models. The authors pre-append word tokens with a few learnable adaption prompts and employ a zero-initialized attention mechanism to seamlessly integrate these new instructional cues, while retaining its pre-trained knowledge. LLaMA-Adapter delivers performance on par with fully-finetuned or LoRA-finetuned Alpaca and generalizes well in multi-modal scenarios."

The clarity and high visual quality of the figures, especially Figures 1, 2, and 3, effectively showcase the proposed method. Technically, the proposed method is sound and achieves on-par performance with fully-finetuned or LoRA-finetuned baselines. The authors provide ample technical details, facilitating replication by other researchers and enabling further development on their methods."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My primary concern with this paper is the limited technical innovation and marginal performance improvement it presents. The concept of zero-initialized attention closely mirrors the zero-initialized convolution in ControlNet [Zhang et al., ICCV 2023]. This seems more like an engineering design rather than a groundbreaking technical contribution. Of the four main characteristics highlighted by the authors in the introduction, both (1) parameter efficiency and (3) plugin with expertise are attributes already provided by LoRA. Regarding (2) training efficiency, the improvement over LoRA is incremental: a reduction from 1.5 hours to 1 hour (in Table 1), while achieving comparable accuracy (in Figure 5). Also, reducing the rank of LoRA can further reduce the number of trainable parameters and potentially speed up the training. I suggest the authors include an additional ablation study on this. Based on these, I am not confident whether the technical contributions and empirical performance of this paper meet the publication standards of ICLR."

Beyond these points, I have several additional questions/comments:\n\n* In Equation 7, the rescaled attention scores no longer represent a probability distribution. Would it be more appropriate to rescale it as [softmax(a) \u00b7 g ; softmax(b) \u00b7 (1-g)]?\n* The authors claim that \"LLaMA-Adapter enables fine-tuning of large-scale language models on mobile devices.\" However, this claim lacks empirical support. While LLaMA-Adapter may reduce memory usage, it doesn't necessarily reduce computation, a potential constraint on mobile devices.\n* The learnable adaptation tokens have been prefixed to the last 30 of 32 layers. What might the implications be if applied across all transformer layers?\n* The second example presented in Figure 4 is not quite correct. The output program seems to produce repetitive numbers."

Compared to the closest baseline, the Alpaca, the proposed method is more effective yet efficient on the same training data and the same LLM (LLaMA 7B).\n- The proposed method has the potential to be used in various domains, including vision and vision language. For example, the zero-initialized attention mechanism can be incorporated with transformer-based vision models like ViT or CLIP, instead of full finetunuing. \n- The manuscripts contain extensive qualitative examples compared to various language and multi-modal models."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I think a number of baselines and performance of the proposed method on multi-modal evaluation are weak to convince the proposed method is more effective than full finetuning LLMs or other efficient methods. I understand there are a lot of recent multi-modal models but many of them are concurrent works. However, I think BLIP2 [1] can be treated as a baseline, which is also a prior work of reported baseline, mini-GPT4. Based on this, I think the reported performances in Table 3 are weak compared to others. For example, the proposed method achieved a 973 score on the MME benchmark, while BLIP2 did 1293. Furthermore, a recent multi-modal model LLaVA-1.5 [2], which fully fine-tunes LLMs, achieved the 1510 score using the Vicuna 7B model. Therefore, I think this manuscript should include empirical backups to show the proposed method is still effective and efficient in the multi-modal domain. \n- I think the most important baselines on instruction following evaluation are Alpaca and Alpaca-LoRa. However, the manuscript only provides qualitative comparisons and brief comparisons in Figure 2. I think it would be great if more quantitative comparisons could be included in the manuscript.\n- The proposed method has a sensitive hyperparameter of \"a number of insertion layers\". In particular, Section 3.2 emphasizes the risk of early insertion layers, while the ablation study in Section 4.3 emphasizes the importance of increasing the number of insertion layers. I think the manuscript could provide more explanation on the choice of the hyperparameter. \n\n[1] Li et al., Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models, ICML 2023\n[2] Liu et al., Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03744"

So, I am curious about the possibility of learning large amounts of data or a large number of tasks.\n- Adaption prompts are randomly initialized, not zero-initialized. If so, is it possible to use full insertion layers in LLaMA?"
