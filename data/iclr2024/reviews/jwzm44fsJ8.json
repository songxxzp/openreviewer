A main contribution is a new evaluation set M^2CRB, which consist of en/pt/es/fr/de queries to python/java/javascript code snippets, all from real world GitHub repositories. The paper also brings up a hypothesis that the model should be able to learn the relationship between a language and a code with no direct training pairs, but bridged by an anchor language. English is used in this study.  \n\nExtensive experiments are done with different languages (natural and code), different sizes of CodeT5 models and different model architecture (CodeT5 with single/dual encoder, CodeBERT and CodeGen). Results show that the model can indeed learn to retrieve non-directly linked pairs of natural and coding languages. The effect of model architecture and sizes are also discussed."

The model is then trained with a contrastive loss aimed at learning similar embeddings for similar code segments/natural languages and a standard autoregressive loss.\n- This work then presents results for code search for the 4 languages introduced in the work, code search using English, and code-code search between Java and Python."

Thus, the authors propose to utilize available NL-paired datasets to indirectly learn code search for these new languages.\n- This training setup, in future work, might also be explored to extend to code generation given NL descriptions in non-English languages.

While baselines might be difficult to get for non-English code search (Table 4), I would assume for Python-Java code search (Table 5) and English code search (Table 6) available model embeddings should work well. For instance, CodeBERT reports an average MRR of 0.7603. It is not immediately clear what the auMRRc would be for this model, and it would have been helpful to get these numbers. Similarly for the Python-Java code search, it would have been nice to get baselines from available multi-lingual pre-trained models.\n- This work requires paired NL data (such as between Spanish and English), and it incorporates this paired data in the loss function. However, another way to utilize this data could be to learn a translation model from English to Spanish using the paired data and use this translation model to translate English queries in the CodeSearchNet data to create a much larger (Spanish, Code snippet) dataset, albeit with some noise. This has the advantage of creating larger synthetic training data that can be directly used to train the code search model, instead of the objective proposed in the paper. Do the authors have some assessment on why the proposed technique is a better approach than this one?"
