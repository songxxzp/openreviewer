Furthermore, the main differences of the proposed model with respect to previous works are outlined.\n\n- The system proposed in Section 2 is novel. It describes an integration of subsystems/submodules that allows for an approximation to the problem, yielding highly promising results. Additionally, the proposed design can be considered innovative. The integration of Cross-View Completion (CroCo) into a navigation system as described has not been explored before, although it's true that this contribution is not the strongest of all. The second pretext task, relative pose estimation and visibility (RPEV) for navigation settings, is interesting and provides significant results. Overall, the originality of the work is considerable.\n\n- The experimental evaluation provides very interesting results in which the proposed model outperforms the state of the art (see tables 4 and 5). An ablation study is provided where the real impact of each of the contributions or parts of the model can be interpreted. Finally, qualitative evidence is presented on how the proposed pre-training process results in the emergence of correspondences between images by analyzing the attention of the last layers."

Figure 4 shows some results or qualitative evidence in this regard. However, the paper does not explain in detail how this image is generated or how these correspondences are analyzed.

Specifically, the dual encoder in DEBiT takes binocular images as input, and the encoded features are merged with a decoder to model the correspondence between the two images. DEBiT is pre-trained with CroCo, followed by RPEV to estimate the relative distance, relative rotation, and overlap between two images. When addressing downstream Instance-ImageNav and ImageNav tasks, DEBiT takes the goal image and agent's observation as inputs, its network is adapted in tuning, and the output representations will be passed to the policy network for decision-making. Results show substantial improvement compared to previous approaches."

The methods introduced in this paper and the resulting pre-trained models are very likely to inspire/to be used by future research in relevant fields.\n- The paper is technically sound; many important arguments and design choices are justified by experiments. Besides the key results, there are many highly constructive analyses/findings, such as \"directly training binocular encoder from scratch\", \"tuning visual encoder with downstream policy network\", \"early fusion vs. late fusion\", \"attention with scale changes\", etc., that are very valuable to future research.\n- Overall, this paper is nicely written; it is very compact, informative, and clear.

                "value": "- The proposed DEBiT model seems to be limited in addressing image-goal navigation tasks (the image-nav task itself needs more justification), and it is unclear how it might benefit other visual navigation problems.\n    - However, I do believe that CroCo and RPEV can help in learning a general (and better) navigation-specific perception model (e.g., for obj-Nav, language-guided-Nav, Audio-Nav, etc.), while I am concerned that it might be much less effective compared to ImageNav which is defined to take two images as input.\n    \n- I am aware that ImageNav is an interesting visual navigation problem and has gained some research attention (publications), but I am still not convinced by its setting, especially how much practical value it might bring to real-world applications. [This question might be more appropriate for researchers who proposed ImageNav, but since this paper is devoted to ImageNav, I believe it must have a very strong reason and motivation behind.]\n    - The two ImageNav tasks consider indoor short-range navigation for finding static objects (Instance-ImageNav has paths with an avg. geodesic length of 12.41m); from the user's perspective (e.g., a household robot), giving instruction in the form of a specific image is unnatural.\n    - From the ImageNav data statistics and the visualization provided in this paper (supp. video), it seems that most of the paths have very few intersections, and the agent doesn't really need to explore the environment but keeps moving to new regions until the target is in its sight. This could be the reason why a very simple policy network, without methods like SLAM, can still lead to amazingly high performance (94% SR). I am concerned that the ImageNav task itself oversimplifies the problem, and this paper might overclaim the contribution to visual navigation research.\n\n- Some experiments are missing to justify arguments (see Questions below).\n\n- The limitation and future extension of this work are not discussed in this paper."

Please also respond to my concerns in Weaknesses.\n\n- (*) This paper mentioned depth inputs, but I wonder why depth images are not applied in the model since it might greatly facilitate learning view correspondence and identifying space and obstacles. (I might have overlooked some details; please correct me if I did.)\n\n- (*) How does the choice of $\\tau$ influence the pre-training and the downstream results? If two images are too distant away and have little overlap, will it be too noisy to learn? Or it might help the visual encoder to learn distant image correspondence and benefit exploration in navigation? Any numerical analysis on this?\n\n- (*) The paper claims the benefit of having visibility estimation but does not quantify its impact on downstream tasks. Any results for this?\n\n- Just curious, can CroCo and RPEV be trained simultaneously? \n\n- In Table 2, from Tiny to Large, the model size increases drastically, but the difference in navigation results is quite small; what might be the reason? Does it mean that a very large perception model might not be necessary? What would be the result of DEBiT-Tiny + Adapters?\n\n- Instance-ImageNav depicts targets viewed from a different camera; if this is the main reason why the proposed method gets much less improvement compared to ImageNav (an OOD situation as claimed), I wonder what if the images for pre-training are augmented with different camera parameters, (1) Is it still feasible to learn CroCo and RPEV? (2) Will it reduce the visual domain gap in downstream?\n\n- Are the visual encoders in OVRLs fine-tuned with the policy networks in downstream tasks? From their papers and Table 4, it seems Yes. But in the section Related Work, \"Once pre-trained, the encoder is often frozen before passing into a policy learning module.\"\n\n- About comparison experiments.\n    - Using adapters in the perception model largely improves the results. I wonder how much improvement it might bring to the previous approaches.\n    - In Table 3, for a fair comparison (in terms of pre-training tasks and #params), I think DEBiT-Tiny and RPEV-only should be listed, which I believe is more rigorous and can prove the same argument.\n    - (*) In Table 4, an important point to mention is the size of the visual encoders (#params) applied in each work. After scanning some papers in the Table, I believe there is a clear trend of larger-models-better-results. But it seems that DEBiT is relatively efficient, especially compared to OVRL-v2. I hope the authors can clarify this point, which I believe will also strengthen the argument.\n\nOther Suggestions:\n- Remove \"(Instance)-\" from the title.\n- I found a paper, \"Learning navigational visual representations with semantic map supervision (Hong et al., ICCV2023)\", which also focuses on learning better navigation visual encoder with view correspondence and uses two images for pre-training. It seems relevant and could be added to the references."

The content of the paper might be mistaken as an investigation into this phenomenon that is carried out in this paper: \n[A] Tang et al, Emergent of Correspondences from Image Diffusion, arXiv, 2023.\nIn fact the emergence of correspondences from the learned representation is not really that surprising, given that the pre-training task is relative pose estimation. Even before the introduction of transformers, monocular pose estimation methods have shown that the representation learns to identify meaningful keypoints on objects. One example:\n[B] Mousavian et al, 3D Bounding box estimation using deep learning and geometry, CVPR 2017\n\nI appreciate the inclusion of the experiment where DEBiT was integrated with ANS for a direct comparison to a modular approach. However, I am surprised by the large performance gap to the proposed method. It seems unintuitive that a method that tries to map pixels directly to actions would outperform an approach that uses a map and de-couples the planning from the control. I think this should be looked more carefully to ensure fair comparison. Was the global policy of ANS finetuned with the frozen binocular encoder b and using the AdaptFormers? ANS was trained for object-goal so probably the Neural SLAM and global policy components need to be re-trained for the ImageGoal task. As it stands, the experiment is not convincing that end-to-end methods are better than modular approaches."
