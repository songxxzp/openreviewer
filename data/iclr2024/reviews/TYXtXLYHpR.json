They aim for two levels of transparency, explaining the forecasting through both its trends and properties. To formalize this approach, the authors introduce the concepts of motifs and compositions, avoiding the tracking of individual trajectory values. TIMEVIEW comprises two components: a predictive model based on B-Spline basis functions, and an algorithm for calculating the composition map to facilitate easy visualization. The efficacy of TIMEVIEW is assessed using four real-world datasets and three synthetic ones, and it is compared against several competitors. Transparency is demonstrated through a user-selected example on a synthetic dataset, with additional examples provided in the appendices."

For instance, I had difficulty understanding Figure 4.\n- Considering Table 2, which classifies types of motifs, have you evaluated how performance would change if motifs were characterized as sets of classes rather than as continuous values? If the end user ultimately requires such a table, perhaps classification would suffice.\n- In the related works, you distinguish your method from shapelet-based methods, stating that these are primarily used for data mining and classification tasks.

In this paper, the authors argue that this view is overly granular and non-intuitive, whereas focusing on the trends and properties of the time series trajectory would be more informative. In the spirit of explainable ML, the authors then propose the notion of bi-level transparency, along with a framework (TIMEVIEW) that encodes time series are a composition of B-splines. The interpretability aspect is further complemented by the development of a UI tool that allows for further explainability, counterfactual reasoning and sensitivity analysis on the time series. The paper concludes with a comparison to other forecasting methods, where the authors note that predictive performance remains comparable with the aded benefit of enhanced interpretability."

And I have a Time Series Forecasting (TSF) background and the I think the terminology used in the paper got me confused. However, the most important question I have is:\n\nWhere is the explainability? If I understand correctly, the proposal can help determine the impact of varying given static parameters (figure 4) on the output of the model. However, it does not infer on why it has this specific impact (the hidden relation in the model). Current, AI models are considered as black boxes because what is happening inside the model to link input and output is complex and too difficult for human to understand. But in my opinion the proposal is not different from such models. It does not give clear relation between input characteristics that generate a given output.  I am not an expert on XAI, but in my opinion, it looks like more to an exploratory platform than a XAI model.\nFurthermore, why is it more comprehensible than other baselines? Someone could set up a platform to visualize the impact of changing the input of a linear model on the produce output, but will it be a good XAI model?\n\nAnd here are some more comments that in my opinion would need to be treated to increase the current score.\n\n# Bottom-up versus Top-down\n\nThe bottom-up approach mentioned by the Authors is rather a \u201cbottom\u201d approach in my understanding. Meaning that models used the raw data (usually regularly spaced) to do TSF. Authors need to clarify this point what is the \u201cup\u201d especially for reader to understand the difference with the proposed approach.\nIs it the following:\n\n*Bottom-up*: from time points predict time points and define a trajectory, but \n\n> understanding trajectory from time points is not natural for human\n\nThen, why not from time point determine the trend (for instance with moving average), min, max and other statistics (with sliding window) that will make understanding \"simpler\"? Why the top-down approach is better?\n\n*Top-down*: Is this approach doing from time point define a trajectory then predict a trajectory for which we first look at trend and properties and then time points? Or from time point predict trajectory for which we first look at trend and properties and then time points?  \n\nIn addition, Authors never demonstrated the issue with the bottom-up approach and why do bottom-up approaches are not bi-level transparent. In related work, they say, \n\n# Terminology\n## Feature\nIn the example box in the introduction, what is the definition of feature? And instance? These terminologies are not clear and may confuse readers.\n\nIn usual TSF, feature (or variate) are other time series that support the prediction of the target (what Authors also called exogenous features). But it looks like a feature in the introduction example is a characteristic or a specific time step of the time series.  Authors would need to clarify these points to avoid confusion when reading.\n\nIn addition, does instance here mean an input sample of the model?\n\n## Regression versus Time series\nIn my opinion, __time series setting__ is not an appropriate terminology. \nit should be multistep forecasting or something similar.\n\n## Knots\nDefinition of knots should not be in appendix.\n\n\n# Continuous time series\n\n> interval [0, T] \u2282 R, where T \u2208 R is a time horizon, and the underlying trajectory is continuous\n\nEvery time series are discrete as values are points/snapshot taken at a given time. Authors might review this sentence or at least clarify their point.\n\n> Thus, understanding a (continuous) trajectory by individual values is unnatural for humans\n\nBut again, time series are never continuous. Even with a very low frequency sampling, it is still a set of points that, in the best scenario, can be matched or approximated by a function/trajectory.\n\n# Function versus trajectory\n\n> there are numerous ways a function can change\n\nI disagree for each time steps the function will either increase, decrease or remain constant, same as regression. Probably, Authors want to say that the function(trajectory?) on the prediction window, may have different shapes depending on different outputs.\n\n# Claims\n\n> often satisfy bi-level transparency but have poor performance\n\nBut where is the proof for that claim? Which model from the experiments are bottom-up approaches?\n\n> However, these methods are not directly applicable to time series forecasting\n\nIt should be backed up by some reference. Linear Regression can be applicable to time series forecasting. Indeed, Linear models such as proposed in [1] have proven to be competitive with latest Transformer-based models, which indeed are less explainable.\n\n# Comparison with decomposition proposal or multi-resolution\n\n[1] and [2] are proposal to decompose time series in trend and seasonality (with either transformer or linear based), why such method would be less explainable than the proposal?\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13504.pdf\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.13008.pdf\n\nWhat are the differences of the proposal with multi-resolution solution such as [3] (learning from different temporal granularity)?\n\n[3] https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05933-9_6\n\n\n\n# Paper needs a proof-reading\n * \u201ddifferent prediction\u201d wrong opening brackets\n * Smoothing parameter is s and motif is also s change to avoid confusion"
