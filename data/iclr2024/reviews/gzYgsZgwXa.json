Because a single word in natural language has strong semantics and is easy for humans to understand, it is most critical for medical images to have small areas. This can better reflect the practical application value of this article.\n- The author mentions the case of model agnosticism. If we consider that the internal gradient of the model is accessible, that is, a white-box model, can the method proposed in this article achieve better attribution results? Or why doesn't it work with white box? I hope the author can discuss relevant content.\n- I hope the author can discuss the limitations of this article and future outlook.\n- In Table 1, why does the value of deletion appear negative? Did the authors fail to normalize the network's classification output?"

In Figure 7, the authors claim that \u201cthe visual impact of different baselines is not significant\u201d. But Figure 7 demonstrates quite different qualitative results.
