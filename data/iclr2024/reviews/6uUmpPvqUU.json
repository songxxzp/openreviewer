Could you elaborate on why this intermediate step is useful for analyzing\n    what would happen in the Transformer?\n\n  1. Upon reading the text a few times, I still do not understand why\n    the bounds of **Thm 5.1** and **Thm 5.2**  would imply that the\n    transformation induced by the layer would approximate the gradient step, or if I understood **Oswald et. al** correctly, that at least there is \n    a choice of layer parameters that would make it approximate the gradient step.\n\n**Minor Questions**:\n* (page 2, first equation): I do not  understand why one needs to introduce a generalized attention formulation if the considered problem is quite simplified."

(2023b), which can further be simplified by the shorthand form $ L_{\\exp}(x) = 0.5 \\lVert c(x) \\rVert_2^2 $ where $ c(x):=f(x)-b, f(x)=\\alpha(x)^{-1} \\exp(Ax), \\alpha(x):=\\langle \\exp(Ax), \\mathbf{1}_n \\rangle. $\n\nThen, Lipschitz bounds for $ \\lVert f(x_{t+1}) - f(x_t) \\rVert_2 $ and $ \\lVert f(A_{t+1}) - f(A_t) \\rVert_2 $ are used to bound\n$ \\lVert \\tilde{b} - b \\rVert_2 $ with respect to  $ \\lVert f(A_{t+1}) - f(A_t) \\rVert_2, $ which reveals the relationship between softmax weight shifting and in-context learning."
