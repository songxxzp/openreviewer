                "value": "The paper \"Local-Forward: Towards Biological Plausibility in Deep Reinforcement Learning\" critiques the biological implausibility of backpropagation in deep learning. It introduces \"Local-Forward\", a temporal-difference learning algorithm that predicts Q-values without backpropagating error derivatives. Instead, it employs local updates and forward connections in time to convey information between layers. This approach, inspired by the Forward-Forward algorithm and attention mechanisms, aims to better model biological neural networks. The method is tested on MinAtar environments, emphasizing its potential for more efficient training and its alignment with biological processes.\n\n----- After rebuttal -----\n\nI appreciate the additional experimental results and clarification from the authors. I feel most of my concerns are addressed. I changed my rating from 3 to 6 accordingly."

Sec. 2.2 only describes the rough idea of it, but not the detailed mathematics of how it works. This is important because it is the basis of the proposed Local-Forward algorithm.\n\n- While the claim is \"we do not propagate any loss signal between cells\", actually the reward signal is used globally (Alg. 1).

There exist other backprop-free learning algorithms such as [a,b] and evolutionary algorithms like CMA-ES [c, d], which can be used for deep RL, how do your method compare with them? I believe a performance / computation cost comparison with them could consolidate the advantage of the proposed Local-Forward model. \n\n2. What are the design motivation of the proposed Local-Forward cell (Fig.2)? The authors state that \"The concept of a cell is reminiscent of the design of a rnn\". However, MinAtar tasks are MDPs and can be handled by feedforward NN, why the paper tries to solve MinAtar with recurrent connections?\n\n3. I am also curious about the performance of Local-Forward in supervised learning tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR. It does not need to be very good since the method is designed for TD-learning, but such additional experimental results may provide better understanding of the suitable scope of the proposed model.\n\n4. What are the computational cost of Local-Forward compared with DQN? e.g., clock time, num of model parameters, FLOPS. As each layer computes Q value, is it more computationally expensive than DQN?\n\n5. Are there any additional biological insights of the Local-Forward model rather than it can solve MinAtar? For example, how the internal representation of neurons compare with animals' neurons and DQN's neurons.\n\n\n### Reference\n\n[a] Ororbia A, Kifer D.

In terms of experiments, there are several areas that need improvement:\n\n1. FF algorithm - There are multiple variations of the FF algorithm, and the author should consider testing more than one rather than relying solely on a single FF algorithm.\n\n2. RL algorithms - Beyond just Q-learning, the author should explore other RL algorithms to provide a more comprehensive analysis.\n\n3. RL tasks - The paper only covers five basic tasks, but it would be beneficial for the author to expand their analysis to a wider range of tasks to effectively compare FF and BP.\n\nIn the analysis, the current focus is primarily on performance. However, it would be beneficial for the author to explore and compare other aspects impacted by FF and BP algorithms, thus enhancing the depth of the article."

I would avoid making claims that are hard, if not impossible, to substantiate, such as the one in the first bullet point at the end of the introduction: \"We propose an alternative to backpropagation for reinforcement learning that does not suffer contradictions with known biology.\" I suggest making this statement somewhat less definitive.\n\n2. You initially define the value function with the symbol $\\mathcal{Q}$ at the beginning of section 2.1,  but then you go on to use the symbol $Q$. Moreover in the recursive relation for $Q$ some lines below in the lhs you have $Q^\\pi$ while in the rhs you dropped the \"policy\" superscript. Is this intentional?\n\n3. I would spend some more words to describe who are and how the matrices $W_{\\rm in}$ and $W_{\\rm query}$ act; probably inserting them also in Figure~2 would help.\n\n4. Conventionally the \"argmax\" indicates a set (of all the points I which the function at hands assume minimal value), but in all your formula,  you use it as if it were a real number. I would suggest to either clarify this or consider using a different notation. For instance is Algorithm 1 I would write $a_t\\in {\\rm arg max} \\dots$ rather than $a_t = {\\rm arg max} \\dots$"
