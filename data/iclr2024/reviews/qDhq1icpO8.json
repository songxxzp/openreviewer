Notably, CBRL.CIV efficiently mitigates the confounding biases between $S$ and $W$, as well as between $W$ and $Y$.  \n3.\tThe paper delves into the theoretical underpinnings of CBRL.CIV, highlighting its robust capability to generalize across varied groups. This ensures a harmonious balance across the CIV, treatment, and outcome regression networks.\n4.\tThrough experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, the effectiveness of CBRL.CIV has been validated in estimating average causal effects.
