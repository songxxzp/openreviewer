            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have two primary concerns about this paper: the awkward presentation order of the narrative and the lack of any empirical results.\n\nThroughout, this paper has an issue with referencing terms and concepts extensively before actually defining them.  While some level of this is often inevitable (e.g., you're not going to have defined everything by the introduction, yet you still need to give a high level overview), this is rampant enough in this paper that it often hinders understanding.  For example, in the introduction, the mentions of a \"pure child\" in the second paragraph, while a bit unclear, were largely fie (despite not knowing what a \"pure child\" was on a first read, I could at some level get that a \"two-pure-children assumption\" was lighter than a \"three-pure-children assumption\".  However, the fourth paragraph of the introduction continues to talk about \"the purity assumption\" and \"pure children\", without even trying to provide a high-level intuition of these terms.  Similarly, the fifth paragraph of the introduction has the line \"the two structures in Figure 2 cannot be discriminated against each other, where {O3, O4) in Figure 2(a) is called a pseudo-pure pair.\" - this is essentially meaningless with any basic terminology or intuition.  I'd recommend keeping the introduction at a higher level and providing some of this discussion after Section 2.\n\nThis pattern persists, on a much smaller scale, throughout Section 3.  For example, in Section 3.1, the paragraph before Theorem 1 reads as though it assumes some familiarity with Theorem 1.  Presenting them the theorem and then presenting a description of the intuition afterwards would lead to a much clearer flow.\n\nIn general, Section 3 is high on technical detail and low on intuition.  Some of the assumptions (e.g., |Nei(L)| >= 4 in Assumption 2) feel very specific and arbitrary.  While I'm sure there's a strong motivation behind it, no discussion is provided to help the reader along in understanding where it comes from.  I'm sure that fitting everything into the page limit was a challenge, but as it stands, I think the lack of discussion and intuition makes the paper challenging to follow.\n\nI see that empirical results are present in the appendix.  However, I wish at least some experiments were included in the main paper.  For those experiments, it also appears (though I may be mistaken) that all of the synthetic data graphs conform to the assumptions made by the authors.  I'd be interested to see how the author's approach performs under mild assumption violations, and how it compare to other algorithms when all of them have their assumptions violated in different ways.\n\nThis is a minor point and doesn't contribute to my score, but the authors use the phrase \"relatively milder\" a lot in this paper, and it feels awkward.  Sometimes, as in the first paragraph of Section 3, an assumption is referred to as \"relatively milder\" when no alternative is being discussed, leaving the comparative \"milder\" feeling strange."

                "value": "Section 2, in the second sentence, says that no observed variable can be a parent of a latent one.  This seems like a non-trivial assumption, yet it is not treated as an assumption, or justified, anywhere that I can see.  Is this a standard assumption in this sort of latent-variable identification literature?  Is there a reason to believe that, in practice, that this assumption is reasonable?\n\nIn Section 3.1, what is \"latent commission\"?  I don't see it anywhere in the paper apart from this mention.\n\nIs there any guidance for how to choose which algorithm/set of assumptions to go with?  For example, in the experimental results in the Appendix, Algorithm 1+2 or Algorithm 1+3 are chosen depending on the underlying graph.  In practice, however, we won't have access to the underlying graph."
