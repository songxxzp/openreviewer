Additionally, how does the computational overhead of SEArch compare to pruning methods or NAS approaches? I think a thorough comparison of NAS, pruning, and KD methods in terms of accuracy and computation is needed. \n2. The application of the proposed method seems to be quite limited.  1) The architecture choice is limited. The paper only uses ResNet for experiments while more advanced mobile architectures are not considered such as MobileNet or Transformers. 2) The operation set is limited. We can only widen and deepen the base architecture."

As the proposed method can only widen and deepen the network (increase the parameters/flops), how do you reduce the parameters/flops of the base network?"

The framework is evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets and achieves better performance compared to other KD and network pruning methods. Abalation studies are also conducted to show the effectiveness of bottleneck identification and edge splitting in the framework."

The authors may conduct more experiments on large and diverse datasets.\n2. The comparison with KD and pruning methods is limited to slightly outdated works, with the most recent being from 2021 (Table 2, 5) and 2020 (Table 3, 4). More recent works should be included for comparison.\n3. The method for determining the channels and strides for each layer, and for matching the size of feature maps to the teacher network, is not explicitly described. The attention module can be used to match channels, but not height and width.\n4. Some important experimental settings are missing. For instance, the authors do not mention whether data augmentation was used for retraining on CIFAR. Additionally, the experimental settings for ImageNet appear overly simplified.\n5. The authors measure network efficiency based on the number of parameters and FLOPs. However, these two metrics may not accurately represent the network's actual latency or throughput. The extensive use of separable convolutions might yield a small number of parameters and FLOPs, but it could potentially increase latency, especially when compared to normal convolutions."
