For example, in the procgen environments, there seems to be a large gap between BC and CQL both in the train and test environment. However, CQL contains a weighted combination of TD-learning loss and behavior cloning loss so a proper tuning of the weights should make CQL at least comparable to BC.\n\nAlthough procgen is a relatively popular benchmark, it is not the primary benchmark for those offline RL methods. They are most extensively tested on continuous control tasks such as D4RL (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07219), so authors should explain why they did not conduct experiments in the setting of continuous control. For example, the different test environments can be attained by modifying the environment parameters such as gravity.\n\nThe conclusion of the paper is derived mostly through empirical observations. It would be important to also have theoretical understandings of why offline RL does not work as well as BC in terms of generalization, similar to the analysis done in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05618.pdf.\n\nI am willing to raise my score if those concerns can be solved."

It seems that we also need more than 3 data points to draw a valid conclusion regards to the trend.\n\nIn Figure 3, why is the blue line sometimes higher than the red line?
