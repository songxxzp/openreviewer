Traditionally, out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors were used for task identification, but this paper introduces a new method called TPLR (Task-id Prediction based on Likelihood Ratio) that leverages additional information like replay data and learned tasks for more effective and principled task-id prediction.

                "value": "1. The writing requires improvement. The author frequently used abbreviations and jargon, especially in the introduction, which occasionally left me puzzled. It would be beneficial if these terms were interpreted more straightforwardly. \n\n2. The related works are also unclear: \n- Although the author clarifies their focus on Class incremental learning, which doesn't provide the task-id during inference, it remains ambiguous whether they are using a memory buffer (rehearsal-based) or are memory-free (online CIL). I suggest the author address this in the introduction and related works.\n- Some recent benchmarks are missing: The author left memory-free (non-replay-based approaches) CIL in related works. The author also left balanced CIL works, e.g., SS-IL, TKIL.\n\n3. Experimental settings:\n- Table 1 is impressive, but the comparisons seem biased. The author claims they compared with 17 baselines, including 11 replay-based and 6 non-replay-based. From my understanding, the author requires a memory buffer, as indicated in the \"Overview of the Proposed TPLR\", equation 2.\n-  It would be more equitable if the author juxtaposed their method with replay-based CIL. Specifically, the author should draw a clear comparison with methods using task-id prediction, highlighting the advantages of their technique. \n- One import baseline is missing: AFC[3]\n  \n\n4. The inference setting remains unclear. Does the author predict both the task-id and class-id simultaneously? Is there any fine-tuning step involved? Typically, some fine-tuning follows the task-id prediction. e.g., iTAML. If the author's method circumvents this, it could be seen as a distinct advantage. Therefore, I recommend the author incorporate a discussion about the computational load when integrating likelihood ratio predictions, elucidating the benefits and drawbacks of this model.\n\n5. Lacks Visualizations: Could the author add a real visualization of data distribution, like the \"Feature-based likelihood ratio score\" in Figure 1. It will be strong evidence the TPLR works well.\n\n\n[1] Ss-il: Separated softmax for incremental learning.

They propose a novel method named TPLR (Task-id Prediction based on Likelihood Ratio), which enhances task-id prediction by utilizing replay data to estimate the distribution of non-target tasks. This approach allows for a more principled solution compared to traditional Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection methods that cannot estimate the vast universe of non-target classes due to lack of data.\n\nTPLR calculates the likelihood ratio between the data distribution of the current task and that of its complement, providing a robust mechanism for task-id prediction. The method is integrated into the Hard Attention to the Task (HAT) structure, which employs learned masks to prevent catastrophic forgetting, adapting the architecture to facilitate both task-id prediction and within-task classification.\n\nThe authors demonstrate through extensive experimentation that TPLR substantially outperforms existing baselines in CIL settings. This performance is consistent across different configurations, including scenarios with and without pre-trained feature extractors. The paper's contributions offer significant advancements for task-id prediction in CIL, proposing a method that leverages available data more effectively than prior approaches."

It is discussed later in the appendix that a very large sigmoid is used in order to force an almost binary mask to promote more of that CF mitigation. However, how relevant is that the masks are binary and that the sigmoid is close to a step function? Would then a method that guarantees no forgetting such as PNN [Rusu et al. 2016], PackNet [Mallya et al. 2018] or Ternary Masks [Masana et al. 2020] be more suitable for the proposed strategy? How do you deal with HAT running out of capacity when the sequence gets longer?\n\nIn Table 1, which of these results are using the task label at inference time? For example, HAT needs the task label. So are the results of HAT comparable here with the other methods? Or is HAT having a forward pass with each task label and then using some heuristic to pick the class?\n\nFor the experiments on running time, in Table 9 of the appendix it is only shown the running times for the 4 methods that have the same base strategy. How do those compare with all the other methods, because I would assume that for large sequences of tasks, it might become quite a limiting factor to have to forward each sample/batch T times. I would argue that is a relevant discussion to have in the main manuscript.\n\nIn the introduction it is mentioned \"This means the universal set [...] includes all possible classes in the world [...], which is at least very large if not infinite in size...\". Is there some paper or relevant source to back this? One of the papers that comes to mind is [Biederman, 1987], which states that there are between 10k to 30k visual object categories that we can recognize in images. And that would hint towards learning an estimate of the distribution for objects in images would not be such unfeasible (specially now with foundational models).\n\nIn conclusion, I find the idea interesting and relevant. However, the small extension from existing related work, and the lack of a better discussion of the limitations and motivation/relevance for the community could be improved."
