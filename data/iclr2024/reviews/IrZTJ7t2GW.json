The significance and roles of each term, notably $G_t$ and $\\eta_t$, are not adequately explained. Furthermore, the insights or conclusions that readers should glean from Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 ought to be more comprehensively discussed.\n\nSimilar issue appear to Theorem 2.\n\n3) The discussion of the experiments is sparse.\n\n4) Most importantly, the purpose of a fairness attack remains unclear to me.

                "value": "- The concept of an adversarial attack concerning a group fairness measure seem unconventional. While existing adversarial attacks utilize point-wise objectives, the proposed fairness attack employs a group-wise objective such as DI or EOd. When this proposed attack is applied at a single point, it can influence all subsequent attacks from other points. This leads to a notational issue in defining fairness adversarial samples: $L_{DI}$ and $L(x, a, y)$ are used interchangeably. It might be more suitable to carry out the attack using individual fairness measures.\n\n- The presentation of fairness robustness lacks clarity in its definition. Only expressions - related to fairness robustness, indicate improved fairness robustness - are presented. The absence of a clear definition weakens the authors' assertions.\n\n- The main assertion here is that the robustness secured by accuracy adversarial samples can guarantee fairness robustness, and vice versa. However, there appears to be a significant issue. When a fairness attack is executed with an objective like DI, its evaluation relies on cross-entropy. Then, in terms of accuracy robustness, fairness attacks essentially amount to weaker attacks on cross-entropy compared to PGD attacks with a cross-entropy objective. In light of this, the proposed claims about alignment of robustnesses become somewhat trivial, potentially diminishing the authors' contributions.\n\n- Being robust to PGD attacks does not necessarily imply the overall adversarial robustness of the model. For a more reliable evaluation of adversarial robustness, I would encourage you to consider using AutoAttack (AA) [1]. AA comprises three white-box attacks (APGD and APGD-DLR as described in [1], and FAB in [2]), along with one black-box attack (Square Attack [3]). In the recent field of adversarial robustness research, it has become a standard practice to report robust accuracies against AA as a means of assessing gradient obfuscation [4].\n\n- (Notational Problems) The authors are simultaneously using $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ and $D(x_{sub,a})$. To express this more appropriately, I suggest that $D_{sub,a}^{DI}$ should be utilized as notation for group characteristics, for example: $D_{sub,a}^{DI}=\\min_{sub,a}D(x)$. Furthermore, the notation $x_{sub,a}$ can be confusing, as it refers to a subgroup at times and to an individual point at other times. The lack of a formal definition for fairness robustness is connected to these issues.\n\n\n[1] Croce, F. and Hein, M.
