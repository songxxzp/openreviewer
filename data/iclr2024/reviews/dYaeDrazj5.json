                "value": "The paper proposes to utilize graph neural networks in conjunction with deep q-networks for learning a game-playing agent for Hex. The authors observe that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are great at playing games such as Go but several games such as Hex are more intuitively expressed using graph representations. As a result, CNNs cannot reason about long-range dependencies two tiles could be very far apart on an image representation but be neighbors on a graph. Thus, the authors use GNNs that can better capture relational inductive biases in such games.\n\nThe authors propose two variants of their approach. The first, GraphDQN utilizes GNNs to learn embeddings that are then passed on to DQN. The second variant, GraphAra, combines GNNs  with MCTS rollouts in a manner similar to AlphaZero. The authors then conduct an extensive empirical evaluation that compares two relevant baselines: CNNs (Gao et al 2018) and U-net."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Unfortunately, I felt that the paper had several weaknesses most of which pertain to the empirical evaluation. Most of my questions will pertain to the same. \n\n**W1a.** The empirical evaluation is quite confusing and not an easy-read. There is too much information to distill. For example, Fig. 6 (and the section on supervised learning) seemed a bit out of place and I am not sure what value it adds to the paper. Another example, Fig 5. plots only until board size 15x25 but Table 1 showcases performance for a single step until 25x25.\n\n**W1b.** Table 1 compares long range dependencies across board sizes but only captures one specific pattern. While I value the significance of these results I would have thought that more different types of long-range patterns would better illustrate the strengths of GNNs being able to capture different strategies. \n\n**W1c.** It is not clear what the authors mean by Gao et al (2018). Is it the Mohex-3HNN (as cited and mentioned in the introduction) or is it just the CNN component? If it is the latter, then I think the authors should clearly mention this. I appreciate the authors comparing the CNN/GNN in one part (Fig 5) and the (CNN + MCTS/GNN + MCTS) in another (Table 2).\n\n**W1d.** GNNs (similar to CNNs) have a limit to their receptive field. This is related to the # of message passing steps in GNNs.\n\n**W2.** It is not clear why the baselines were manipulated in any way. For example, \"Additionally. we do not use batch-normalization ...\". This makes the evaluation a bit confusing to follow. It would have been better to leave the baselines untouched as-is and compare them. I appreciate the authors trying to make their architectures as close to each other (in parameter size etc) but I think that considering the presented results where even these modfications outperform GNNs (see W3b for the gao- rationale), this does more harm than good.\n\n**W3a.** Finally, the baselines do seem to outperform the GNN approach significantly on most of the presented problems. For example vanilla Gao and U-net outperform the GNN on the training problem and Gao outperforms the GNN on most problems. (Data on board sizes 16x16 and over is not reported).\n\n**W3b.** I appreciate Gao- ablation showcasing the weakness of CNNs without the padding. However, I believe that it is not really a weakness of Gao. Firstly, the Hex board game itself has the padded edges to indicate the direction (left-right/top-down) to draw the edge so there is no human expert engineering done by the gao authors. Secondly, the GNN representation that the authors use seems to incorporate some human expertise and is not domain-independent (which the authors do admit to in their section on Limitations). Overall, i think this ablation does not motivate the strengths of GNNs over CNNs convincingly.\n\n**W3c.** For Table 2, why is MoHEX-3HNN not compared? The authors state it as a SOTA method in the introduction but it is not clear if Mohex-1k is equivalent."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Below are my questions to the authors. Please feel free to merge any overlapping answers.\n\n**Q1a.** Can you please motivate why Fig. 6 is a good addition to the paper?\n\n**Q1b.** Are there any other patterns that you are aware where GNNs would fare better?\n\n**Q1c.** Could you please clarify my comment on W1c.\n\n**Q1d.** Could you please comment on why the long range dependency pattern was easily identified by the GNN? Is it because the nodes are immediate neighbors in the shannon graph for this pattern? How many iterations of message passing were used in your approach?\n\n**Q2.** Could you please comment on W2.\n\n**Q3a.** The results from Fig 5 are missing results on board sizes 16x16 to 24x24. Do you have some data here that better highlights the transfer performance of GNNs. Since the transferable network does not need to be trained for those sizes and since some results are already reported for them (Table 1) it seems confusing as to why they were not run.  It appears that you could have showcased transfer performance much more effectively since the trend appears to favor GNNs only at the end. \n\n**Q3c.** Can you please elaborate on my comment on W3b.\n\nOverall, I think this is very interesting work but has been over shadowed by a limited empirical evaluation. I hope that the authors are able to address some of my questions."

It focuses specifically on the Hex setting.\n\n**Novel Idea**\n\nPopular methods of observation encoding for matrices often utilize the convolutional neural network. However, the inductive biases that come with such networks often do not support board game settings where non-local dependencies are prominent.\n\nThis paper proposes a DQN-style reinforcement learning framework, using a graph neural network as the encoder for the policy and the value network. The input to the graph is taken as an observation from the environment, and the embeddings are calculated via a GNN update. The embeddings are then passed into an advantage and value head to compute the Q values.\n\nExperiments show that the GNN based model makes less errors when calculating the Q-value on a board state that requries long term dependencies. The GNN displays better transformer performance, although it performs with less accuacy on the smaller board size."
