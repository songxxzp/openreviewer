The authors rely on a specific property of outerplanar graphs: biconnected outerplanar graphs have a unique hamiltonian cycle which can be identified in linear time, and this by identifying this cycle, one can uniquely identify each biconnected outerplanar graph. The authors hence use a linear-time algorithm to identify the cycle, and then compute the hamiltonian adjacency list (HAL), which is then used to create an annotated transformation of the input graph. Since 1-WL-expressive GNNs can identify any labelled trees, the authors show that the presented algorithm combined with a 1-WL-expressive-GNN can identify outerplanar graphs. Experiments on two molecular datasets shows that the method yields meaningful improvements on the baseline GNN models."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- **Scholarship**: The fundamental of this paper is to annotate graphs with labels to enhance the discriminative capacity of standard GNNs, which is widely studied under different node labelling approaches and a more thorough related work coverage is essential. Most importantly, there is a recent paper \"Dimitrov et al, PlanE: Representation Learning on Planar Graphs, NeurIPS 2023\"  which introduces a *complete algorithm on the class of all planar graphs*. This paper strictly subsumes the result presented in the current submission.\n\n- **Technically incorrect statements**: There are many hand-wavy and sometimes incorrect statements. First of all, authors should cite the paper \"Kiefer et al,  The Weisfeiler-Leman Dimension of Planar Graphs is at most 3, LICS 2017\" or its journal version and present the result correctly: The result states that 3-WL is complete on planar graphs (and not just on outerplanar graphs). Moreover, authors also confuse the dimension counts of WL: \"...any GNN which matches the expressivity of 3-WL, such as 3-IGN (Maron et al., 2019) or 3-GNN (Morris et al., 2019), is capable of solving our main goal of distinguishing all outerplanar graphs.\" This is incorrect since Kiefer et al's result uses the classical WL algorithm also referred as the folklore 3-WL, so neither 3-IGN nor 3-GNNs have folklore 3-WL power. It is also open whether folklore 2-WL would suffice for planar isomorphism testing.\n\n- **Significance and novelty**: The paper's technical contribution is limited. Leveraging 1-WL result in combination with CAT is interesting but relatively straightforward. My biggest concern is that there are complete neural models on planar graphs, which are also very scalable. The other technical contributions amount to arguing about shortening the propagation distance in the graph for better information flow. I find this analysis somewhat weak, because this effect can be trivially achieved by adding a virtual node or alike. It appears tangential to the study. \n\n- **Baselines**: I understand that the authors would like to convey the idea of empowering existing GNN models with CAT, but I still think the comparison should be broader when it comes to baseline models.There are many models, including e.g. CIN which achieves very strong results on ZINC. There is also the question of whether this method is applicable to a broader class of models."

They also discussed the property of the processed graphs, such as diameter and resistance distance. The approach is efficient in that the graphs are a linear number of vertices and edges.\n\nFinally, the authors conducted experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

Both works share a common foundation rooted in biconnectivity, specifically concerning biconnected components and block cut trees, as well as a focus on distance metrics, encompassing the shortest path distance and resistance distance. Since the motivation of the two papers is also similar (both pointing out the importance of planar graphs in practice and giving molecular graphs as counterexamples), I feel that giving an in-depth discussion (perhaps within the introductory section of your paper), could further justify the paper's significance and provide a more comprehensive context for the reader.\n\n   Besides, I also found that another recent paper [2] studied a similar topic to your paper but this paper currently did not discuss it. Could you provide some discussions for the similarity and difference between the two works?\n\n2. The proposed CAT transformation is somehow complicated, in particular for the general case (Definition 2). I think it may be beneficial to discuss more about the intuition of Definition 2 in Appendix. Moreover, it introduces a lot of additional nodes and edges and even changes an undirected graph to a directed one. While it has indeed shown that the separation power is improved, significantly changing the structure of the input graph may result in some drawbacks. As another problem, can the approach be extended to node classification? \n\n3. The proposed approach only works for outer-planar graphs. Can the results be generalized to general planar graphs? I think Lemma 1 does not hold in the general setting. Since still about 5% of the graphs are not outer-planar as shown in Table 1, this is perhaps a limitation.\n\n4. While the experimental results showed that an MPNN with CAT can outperform vanilla MPNN, such baselines are actually quite weak. I am not fully convinced to what extent the proposed approach is superior in practice.\n\nDespite the weaknesses and questions, I still appreciate this paper and tend towards giving an acceptance. I will consider increasing the score if the concerns are well-addressed.\n\nMiscellaneous minor issue: in the fourth line in page 8, there is a redundant word \"and\".\n\n\n[1] Rethinking the expressive power of GNNs via graph biconnectivity.

                "value": "In this work, the authors studied the isomorphic problem of a special graph family, outerplanar graphs, by using GNNs. Compared to general graphs, most pharmaceutical molecular graphs correspond to this graph family. To this end, the authors proposed an efficient graph transformation approach to enhance the expressiveness of classical MPNNs. Additional theoretical analysis is provided to show that maximum expressivity on outerplanar graphs is achieved with the proposed approach. Empirical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

                "value": "1. The targeted problem is of great practical significance. As pointed out in this paper, most pharmaceutical molecules correspond to outerplanar graphs, which play important roles in real-world applications in chemistry and biology.\n\n2. The proposed CAT approach is both efficient (in linear time) and theoretically sound."

                "value": "1. Lacking clarifications and discussions of related work. In [1], the authors developed a framework for the whole planar graphs class, which seems very relevant to this work. It is highly recommended to (1) clarify the novelty and originality of this work against [1]; (2) add discussions on the relations, scopes and any other aspects of these two works for improved quality.\n \n2. The empirical evaluation needs to be further improved. Although the authors provided results on several benchmark datasets, I still think the evaluation does not meet the bar of this conference:\n    - In Table 4, CAT+GAT consistently underperforms GAT on most datasets. Such a degrade performance brought by CAT is strange compared to that in GIN/GCN. Could you provide further explanation on this phenomenon?\n    - The experimented baselines are limited. In Table 4, only GCN,GIN and GAT are tested. In recent years, there exist advanced GNN variants with linear complexity. To better verify the generality of the proposed approach, it is highly recommended to conduct more experiments on other GNNs.\n    - The scale of chosen benchmarks is limited. From Table 1, we can see that there also exist large-scale molecule datasets (>100k) suitable to verify the approach for outplanar graphs. It is highly recommended to conduct more experiments on more large-scale datasets to see whether the proposed approach can consistently bring gains in this setting.\n\n[1] Dimitrov, R., Zhao, Z., Abboud, R., & Ceylan, I.
