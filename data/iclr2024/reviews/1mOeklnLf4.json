Detailed weaknesses are as follows.\n\n- The authors claim that one of FroSSL's main contributions is fast convergence. However, FroSSL is derived from rotational invariance, rather than being directly derived from fast convergence. Explanations are needed regarding the relationship between rotational invariance and fast convergence.\n- The experimental results appear to lack significance. For instance, as shown in the ImageNet results of Table 4, it's evident that FroSSL converges faster than Barlow Twins only when the performance is 50% or lower. However, there are doubts about the significance of this result because it's unlikely that one would use a model with performance below 50%.\n- The explanations for the figures and tables in the paper are insufficient. For example, it is unclear what the paper means by \"variants\" in Figure 2, and the dataset used for Figure 3 is not specified. This lack of clarity hinders the understanding of the reader.\n- In Table 2, FroSSL exhibits suboptimal performance when compared with other methods.\n- There seems to be a lack of experiments. (e.g., experiments on larger models where fast convergence is critical, analysis on the role of log, \u2026)"

                "value": "- Based on the paper, the dimension-contrastive method is characterized by its absence of negative samples, whereas the sample-contrastive method explicitly employs negative samples. Therefore, it might be inferred that dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive approaches are inherently distinct and cannot coexist within the same framework.\nHowever, the first contribution of this study, as corroborated by Proposition 3.3, asserts that FroSSL is simultaneously dimension-contrastive and sample-contrastive.\nThis apparent contradiction raises a compelling question: How can FroSSL reconcile these seemingly opposing attributes within its framework?\n- What are the Figure 5.1, Figure 5.2, and Table 5.2 referring to?\n- This study does not offer experimental results for the speed of convergence concerning CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.\n- The issue of implementation effectiveness concerning the minimization of the Frobenius norm loss has been previously addressed in [1].

However, while fast convergence is a desired feature it is mostly beneficial in the case where convergence is to a competitive value or if at early epochs there is a substantial gap in performance. Judging by the provided experiments this is not the case as elaborated in the next point. \n\n[-] overstated performance: the performance of the method is overstated judging by the provided experimental results. First, the main results (Table 2) are provided for \u201cfull\u201d training length (1000/500 epochs), that is without utilizing the fast convergence property (and still does not outperform competing methods). Next, looking into the short training analysis over STL-10 (Table 3) already at 30 epochs SwAV is reaching nearly identical performance as FroSSL and from 50 epochs FroSSL\u2019s performance is not in the top-3. Similarly (Sec. 6.2 and Figure 4) for ImageNet compared to Barlow Twins (BT), as highlighted by the authors, at 30 epochs the methods are already reaching similar performance, while at 100 epochs FroSSL seems to have a slight advantage over BT, it is important to note that BT is not SOTA.  \n\n[-] related work: two kernel-based methods which are very closely related to FroSSL are presented in the section for related work sec. 4.3 (\u201cEntropy in SSL\u201d). It will be beneficial to include these in the benchmark analysis to showcase the advantages of FroSSL in comparison to similar methods.\n\n[-] minor: links to figures and tables are referencing respective sections.
