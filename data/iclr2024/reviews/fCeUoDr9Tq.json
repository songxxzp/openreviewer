The key idea is to leverage insights obtained from language models based on task descriptions. After extracting the insights, they use the insights to modify the image embeddings, removing harmful components and enhancing useful ones, without any supervision. To achieve this goal, the method encourages invariant representation (to spurious features) by projecting the pre-trained model embeddings onto the subspace orthogonal to the subspace spanned by spurious feature descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves multi-modal and language model zero-shot performance."

I find the experiment in Appendix F.5 to be inconclusive due to the simplicity of the considered concepts, and I can\u2019t immediately understand why the average of the images having a higher cosine similarity should give any insight on the decomposition of the space in harmful, helpful and neutral subspaces.\n    - Unfortunately, the overall motivation and analysis seems to lay on this assumption, making it a core criticity of the work.\n- The 15.98% improvement claim in the abstract actually regards the increase in Worst Group accuracy and not the overall improvement which is probably not positive, I find it should be stated clearly to avoid misleading the reader.\n- The qualitative assessment does not really immediately convey the effect of increasing $u^k$. Some quantitative metrics would help, e.g. class separability measure such as the ratio of the inter-class distance to the average intra-class distance $\\frac{d_{\\text{inter}}}{\\frac{1}{2} (d_{\\text{intra}{C_1}} + d{\\text{intra}_{C_2}})}$\n- From the presentation perspective, the captions could be improved. Figure 1 could use a textual description to clarify what\u2019s going on in the image, e.g. how does it go from having two projected embeddings and a single one in the right part.  Analogously, the caption of Figure 2 doesn\u2019t state what are $Y_0$ and $Y_1$\n- The framework fails in several cases to maintain the average accuracy of the baseline, being therefore only advisable when worst group accuracy is the metric of interest. Is this realistic? It would be nice to have a method that fell back to the standard setting when the approach proves to be detrimental."
