                "value": "This paper introduces a model-based RL method to learn to play atari in a sample-efficient manner (100k environment interactions). The basic approach of this paper is similar to various MBRL papers wherein they first learn a state representation followed by learning the dynamics of the environment which is followed by learning the policy in the imagined environment. In this paper, the above 3 steps are carried out as follows:\n\n- Representation learning: The proposed method learn a discrete representation of the state space using a vq-gan style approach. Each frame is encoded to K tokens from a codebook.\n\n- Dynamics learning: The proposed method utilize a transformer to learning the dynamics. The dynamics learning is comprised of 3 objectives - (1) predicting next token given the previous tokens, (2) predicting the reward for each frame, (3) predicting whether the episode has ended.\n\n- Policy learning: The proposed method use actor-critic to learn the policy. The policy is parametrized as a ViT encoder which takes as input - (1) A cls token, (2) A set of codes from a particular frame, (3) A mem token which aggregates information from past frames. The output corresponding to the CLS token is used to output the action and the value. The output corresponding to the mem token is used as input the ViT for the next frame. \n\nThey show that their approach results in state-of-the art performance across 26 atari games when measuring median performance. Furthermore, they present various ablations such as visualizing the attention matrix of the policy and evaluating the model without various components such as positional embeddings, exploration, mem token etc."

The advantage of not using reconstructed observations is that it is a lot more computationally efficient to use the latent states directly."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "These are not weakness per se, but the reviewer thinks In these respects paper can be improved:\n\n- The approach is simple (which is good) and integrates components used by the model already exist in literature. Learning a world models on discrete tokens has been previously introduced in IRIS and using a ViT policy (which the authors claim to be their main novelty) head has been studied by Yoon et al 2023 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04419). Usage of a memory token to feed past context has also been studied in Bulatov et al 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06881), Didolkar et al 2022 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14794), Moudgil et al 2021 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14143). I would suggest to include these works in the introduction and recontextualize the work based on the above works.\n\n- The results dont seem strong enough. The model only differs from IRIS in the policy and in many games IRIS still performs better. Secondly, according to the IRIS paper, they achieve superhuman performance in 10 games while in Table 1 it says 9 games and DART also achieves superhuman performance in 9 games. Therefore, IRIS actually can outperform humans in more games than DART hence the usefulness of of the ViT policy is not very apparent. It would be nice to see a section where the authors compare DART to only IRIS and try to study in more detail the importance of the ViT policy. Figure 3b compares DART to each approach individually but I am not sure how these probabilities are calculated. Can the authors clarify this?\n\n[More of a comment than a weakness]. While the current paper and the baselines study the performance in a setting where the model is limited to 100k interactions, I think it would still be useful to compare how these approaches scale with more interactions and whether the current trends still hold with more interactions."
