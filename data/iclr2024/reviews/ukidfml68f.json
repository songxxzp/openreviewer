Insufficient ablation study\nThe paper reviews parameter-wise normalized Gradient Descent (NGD) and Gradient Clipping (GC) in Sec. 3.2 & 3.3 and proposes pixel-wise NGD and GC in Sec. 4.3 & 4.4. Pixel gradients are computed from parameter gradients, and bounded parameter gradients may result in bounded pixel gradients too -- an alternative of the proposed Sec. 4.3 & 4.4 to limit pixel gradient magnitudes. Therefore, parameter-wise NGD and GC would have served as good baselines for ablation study. However, the paper only showed results of pixel-wise NGD and GC but not results of parameter-wise NGD and GC or other simple ways to bound pixel gradients. \n\n2. Insufficient experiments to show that the proposed method \"benefit existing SDS and LDM-based 3D generative models\"\nThe paper claims \"PGC consistently benefit existing SDS and LDM-based 3D generative models\", but experiments only compared with two baselines: Stable-DreamFusion and (SDXL variant of) Fantasia3D, which are not published state-of-the-arts and not sufficient to support the claim. For example, ProlificDreamer [Wang et al. 2023] and improved Fantasia3D (https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/Fantasia3D \"Q7\") can produce more realistic texture results than the compared baselines. Will the proposed PGC still be effective on top these two methods?"

However, in such methods (SDS), it is challenging to control gradients at the pixel level when applying pretrained models. To address this issue, this paper proposes a method called Pixel-wise Gradient Clipping (PGC) to effectively control gradients and incorporate them into existing 3D generation models. The proposed PGC offers a straightforward approach that can greatly aid in rendering high-quality, high-resolution objects. This paper proposes a reasonable approach within the context of previous research efforts in the actively studied field of 3D object generation to achieve high-quality results in high resolution. It introduces not only regularization for Score Distillation sampling but also Pixel-wise normalized gradient descent (PNGD) to preserve the details of textures. These techniques aim to generate high-resolution outputs with excellent quality."
