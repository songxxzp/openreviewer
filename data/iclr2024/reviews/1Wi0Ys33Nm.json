Therefore, since the main contribution of this paper is supposed to be for the theoretical study of NN, I believe that the paper is not novel in that sense. Also, there are many grammatical mistakes and in general it feels that the authors did not make an all out effort when writing their paper."

If it is ``difficult\" to explain these at this point in the flow of the paper, then probably those definitions should come after, and keep the introduction clean from technical mathematical definitions. \n\n3.

They illustrate the generality of their proposed assumption by showing several non IID examples used in practice that fall under their proposed definition. \n\nFinally, they present numerical simulations for the convergence to Gaussian processes for fully connected networks with widths up to 300, where they examine the variance and joint distributions over a single neuron."
