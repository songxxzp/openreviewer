                "value": "This work presents a framework that integrates sophisticated representation learning with long-term memory to improve novelty-seeking behaviours in deep reinforcement learning. The framework consists of two key components: RECODE, a memory buffer that approximates visitation counts in a learned embedding space; and CASM, a transformer model that learns the embedding space by jointly addressing masked sequence modelling and inverse dynamics prediction. \n\nThe paper explores and implements various components to tackle challenges inherent in deep RL, such as non-stationary distributions, online learning of representations, and sparse rewards. Experimental results on challenging benchmark tasks demonstrate that RECODE (the memory buffer) enhances performance regardless of the representation learning method, and CASM improves performance independently of the memory-based approach. The algorithm is compared with NGU and Byol-Explore, two recent and popular deep exploration algorithms. \n\nOverall, the paper presents a sophisticated algorithm that achieves great performance in hard-exploration tasks, and its implementation details are well-justified and clearly presented."

Concerning RL-related work, it extends existing non-parametric novelty estimation methods that maintain a history of observations in a memory buffer and use KNN to compute similarity. However, this work pushes the boundaries of previous memory-based algorithms by operating the memory buffer in a much more compact embedding space. Additionally, the paper presents several implementation details to ensure an accurate estimation of true visitation counts, addressing challenges related to non-stationary data and representation distributions. For representation learning, the paper adopts the widely recognized transformer architecture for sequence modelling and employs masked training to learn compact representations in reinforcement learning. Furthermore, the study incorporates the established inverse dynamics prediction objective but frames it within the more condensed embedding space. This work effectively combines and adapts robust foundations from multiple fields into a high-quality and well-justified framework for reinforcement learning, resulting in outstanding practical performance.\n\nThe paper maintains clarity, offering comprehensive descriptions of the background theory and the architecture of the presented framework. It includes numerous helpful figures and algorithm pseudo-code, enhancing the reader's understanding of the method. Notably, the paper meticulously addresses significant challenges related to long-horizon exploration in deep RL, each thoroughly examined with dedicated experiments and figures that surpass typical task-return analyses.\n\nIn summary, this work makes a significant contribution to the community. Specifically, it introduces an algorithm that harnesses potent representation learning and precise novelty estimation to solve challenging long-horizon exploration problems effectively."

While this choice appears suitable, the paper lacks an analysis showcasing the performance of more commonly used algorithms like PPO or DQN when coupled with RECODE. Including such comparative results would significantly support the paper's claims regarding RECODE's versatility in enhancing long-horizon exploration across various RL algorithms. VMPO is also used for the DM-Hard-8 suite, but I believe this doesn't provide evidence that RECODE would still work well with more popular RL algorithms."

This method combines elements from both parametric and non-parametric techniques in this domain.\n\nInitially, the paper delves into the existing literature of novelty-driven exploration. Parametric strategies involve assessing novelty by utilizing trained representation models on states and actions. However, these methods are prone to issues like catastrophic forgetting or predicting novelty where it is irrelevant with respect to \"controllable\" features. On the other hand, non-parametric techniques maintain a repository of historical embeddings. They employ approaches such as state counting to drive novelty-based exploration, or approximate state counting in continuous domains.\n\nIn contrast to traditional methods, the authors introduce RECODE, which is a non-parametric approach relying on a historical embedding repository. Instead of simply erasing entries from this history, RECODE dynamically adjusts embeddings and counters by employing a system of discounted sums.\n\nThe paper also offers a series of experiments showcasing RECODE's superior performance when compared to baseline methods. Remarkably, RECODE stands out as the first Reinforcement Learning algorithm to tackle the game \"Pitfall!\" and surpass the human baseline in \"Push Blocks\" from DM-HARD-8."

However, this simplification comes at the cost of mechanisms to manage the memory (see W1).\n\n**S3.** In terms of the empirical evaluation, the environments considered are indeed challenging exploration problems.

Here, there are hyperparameters for atoms of memory size, a discounting of counts and additional heuristics to update/add/remove atoms of memory. Some of the additional complexity and increase in hyperparameters might make it hard to apply this approach to new environments.\n\n**W2.** Further ablations are needed to clarify certain issues.\n\nIs CASM only beneficial over one-step action prediction (AP) when there is high aliasing due to partial observability (like DM-HARD-8)? Are results for MEME-RECODE/NGU-CASM available for the Atari environments? I may have missed them in the appendix.\n\nIn Appendix L, results are presented for RND on AP (one-step action prediction), where a random net is applied to features extracted by AP. As the random network is typically seen as a feature extractor itself, wouldn\u2019t it be more natural to obtain RND-like intrinsic rewards from a predictor of the AP feature of a state (rather than a random embedding of the AP embedding)?\n\nSimilarly, it would be helpful to evaluate if RECODE is better than NGU when NGU uses RND on AP (or an RND-like bonus with AP features directly) for its global bonus.\n\n**W3.** The paper would benefit from connections to existing work. For instance, the recently proposed MIMEx [1] also uses masked transformers to derive trajectory level intrinsic rewards. \n\nPrevious works have studied incorporating information over longer trajectories to derive better intrinsic rewards under partial observability, [4] uses general value functions based on RND, other approaches use successor features which naturally incorporate multi-step information [2,3].\n\n**W4.** In the abstract and the conclusion, the authors claim that the proposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on Atari\u2019s hard exploration dataset and DM-HARD-8. While this claim is reasonable for DM-HARD-8, I am not sure it applies to the Atari experiments, as RECODE appears to be worse than NGU in hero and venture.\n\nI remain open to increasing my score, should the weaknesses and questions be adequately addressed/clarified.\n\n\n\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\u2014------------------\n\n### References\n\n[1] Lin, T., & Jabri, A.

Incorporating the comments shared in the reply to W3 would help better contextualize the contributions of RECODE. Modifying the wording and including the details shared here will avoid misinterpreting claims (W4). \n\nComing back to W1, your response helps me better understand the \"complexity\" trade-off with respect to NGU. I appreciate the point regarding long episodes. Removing RND is a significant plus, especially if it is hard to tune. The new sensitivity analysis in the appendix supports the paper (it would be nice to see more values considered in the next version). *Ideally*, this claim should also be backed through sensitivity analysis with NGU/RND.\n\nA minor note I missed in the original review is a slight inconsistency between the Background and General Notation sections. For example, policies map observations to distribution over actions in Background, but in General Notation, the policy operates on histories. \n\nAnother minor issue is that the caption of Figure 6 uses top/bottom instead of left/right."
