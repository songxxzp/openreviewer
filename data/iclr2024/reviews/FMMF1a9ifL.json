                "value": "In the paper, the authors present Gradual Optimization Learning Framework (GOLF), a framework for improving the efficiency of generating low-energy molecular conformation prediction models, a crucial technology used in computer-aided drug discovery and materials design.\n\nOverall, the paper is well written and presents some valuable insights into applying active learning efficiently for the discovery of energy minimized conformations. Traditional approaches, such as Density-functional theory (DFT) models, use high-fidelity physics-based numerical quantum chemistry simulators whose computational costs are exponential with respect to the complexity of the molecule under study. Unfortunately, this limits their applicability to simple molecules with few atoms or electrons. To address computational complexity and to scale conformal optimization to more complex molecules, researchers have explored various alternatives based on lower fidelity linear models and, more recently, neural network models that leverage the availability of computed quantum property molecular databases. Sadly, these alternate approaches lead to inaccurate predictions and suffer from distribution shift. To scale conformal energy prediction to larger molecules while addressing computational cost, the authors propose GOLF, an automated data augmentation scheme and a hybrid computational approach that combines the use of both high and low-fidelity simulators as well as neural networks.\n\nIn Section 1, the authors present the concept of low-energy molecular conformations and their uses. This section is well written and provides an adequate background of the approach and the insights that motivate the solution. The authors indicate that the fundamental problem with traditional approaches, such as DFT, to obtain optimal conformations is their high computational cost. These approaches, which are based on numerical quantum chemistry simulations that calculate anti-gradients representing molecular forces, are iterative by nature and, when given a sufficiently complex molecule or physical system, may fail to complete even a single iteration. For this reason, the authors claim that \u201creducing the number of interactions with the physical simulator\u201d is crucial for efficiency. The authors then go on to describe current methods that apply Neural Network Potentials (NNP), a form of deep neural networks, to the problem. NNP-based techniques significantly reduce computational complexity by using the gradients inherent to neural networks to model the molecular forces, thereby obviating the need for expensive simulations. Unfortunately, the NNP approach suffers from distribution shift resulting in inaccurate predictions. The authors then introduce GOLF, which employs a data augmentation active learning scheme to improve the diversity of the training dataset, thereby alleviating the distribution shift. By doing so, GOLF achieves energy minimized conformation prediction accuracy comparable with that of high-fidelity simulations while retaining the intrinsic efficiencies gained by using neural networks. A novel framework for data-efficient training of NNPs, GOLF comprises three components: 1) a computationally expensive high-fidelity simulation that is a genuine oracle (GO) used to calculate the ground truth energies and forces; 2) an optimizer that uses the NNP gradients to produce optimization trajectories that constitute the additional training dataset; and 3) a computationally inexpensive low-fidelity simulation that is a surrogate oracle (SO) used to augment the training dataset. Finally, the authors then conclude this section by summarizing their contributions.\n\nHowever, there are various weaknesses in this section as well that can be addressed to improve the quality of the paper. 1) The statement that \u201creducing the number of interactions with the physical simulator\u201d is unclear and the reviewer assumes the efficiency objective is attained by reducing the number of iterations required to produce optimal low-energy conformations. 2) The authors state that they augment the dataset with \u201coptimization trajectories\u201d without explaining what such a trajectory is and how the trajectories address distribution shift. At a minimum, providing a reference to the discussion of augmented data in Section 5 would be useful. 3) Moreover, as GOLF requires running the high-fidelity simulation, GO, to produce the anti-gradients, it is unclear whether GOLF can be successful when GO fails to complete a single iteration. This is a serious flaw in the paper and needs to be addressed. 4) In addition, the \u201cAb initio property\u201d phrase is used without a definition or description and seems rather superfluous to the narrative. 5) The adequacy of the requirement for 5 X 105  \u201cadditional oracle interactions\u201d, which presumably means optimization trajectories that augment the training dataset, is likely anecdotal based on the molecules selected for the experiments. If that is not the case, an explanation of why it is generally applicable should be articulated.\n\nIn the \u201cRelated Works\u201d section (Section 2), the authors describe a variety of contemporary approaches to conformation generation. The benefits and drawbacks of these methods are discussed. However, it is not clear to the reviewer how GOLF addresses the drawbacks of these approaches. Successfully addressing the drawbacks could demonstrate GOLF\u2019s superiority. Also, form the exposition in this section, it is not clear how significantly different the GOLF approach is to the active learning technique presented by Kulichecnko et al. (2023). Finally, the phrase \u201cwe believe it is necessary to explore further the ability \u2026\u201d is confusing. Are the authors proposing future work or teeing up the discussion in the remainder of the paper?\n\nIn the \u201cNotations and Preliminaries\u201d section (Section 3), the authors summarize the theoretical foundation of their approach. Although informative, the notation is somewhat cryptic and can benefit from slightly greater verbosity or additional graphics. Also, mentioning GOLF models in this section, without any discussion as to what they are or how they differ from ftraj, seems premature and confusing. At the very least, there should be a forward reference to Section 5 that articulates how GOLF intelligently identifies the datasets that promote diversity, which enhances prediction performance. Moreover, a small discussion of the NNP architecture used in the experimentation would be useful for the sake of completeness.\n\nSection 4 presents \u201cConformation Optimization\u201d. This section is well written and the both the graphic, Figure 1, and the table, Table 1, provide valuable insight. The Figure 1 graphic clearly depicts the distribution shift, in terns of Mean Square Error (MSE), increasing as the optimization progresses. The graphic also depicts that the prediction accuracy improves \u2013 MSE decreases \u2013 when augmenting the training dataset with GO produced optimization trajectories. This is an important result but without highlighting it, the reader can easily miss that it is one of the contributions of the paper. Table 1 seems to be highlighting precision of the approach, but the word is not used in the discussion. It is unclear to the reviewer as to the innovativeness of the approach, which may be construed as a weakness. Moreover, using the GO to provide the baseline training dataset may limit the scalability of the approach.\n\nThe authors present a sound argument in Section 5 where they present the GOLF algorithm and discuss using a high-performance low-cost surrogate oracle to make the data generation computationally tractable. The \u201cExperiments\u201d section, Section 6 is reasonably complete though much of the discussion seems anecdotal. The reviewer is unable to determine how many of the experimental results were achieved through a fortuitous selection of the molecules under study. Also, the authors report that the GOLF technique can produce \u201ca high percentage of diverged conformations\u201d. This is not surprising as the training dataset is likely to be much noisier as a result of the choice to use a low-cost simulation. It would be nice to get better characterization of the noise and its effects, including the loss in efficiency resulting from these unusable conformations.\n\nSections 7, 8, and Appendices conclude the paper. An explicit tie back to the goals and contributions identified in the Introduction would be beneficial."

In a different section of the paper, the claim is that for a sufficiently complex system, the physical simulation may not succeed in completing even a single iteration in a reasonable amount of time. Taken together, these two statements seem to suggest that GOLF is atomic complexity scale limited. How do the authors claim to address this apparent limitation?\n2) In the Experiments section (Section 6), how much of the results are related to the selection of the molecules under study? Stated differently, how do the authors plan to address the generalizability of the approach?\n3) The additional data generated for Active Learning are selected based only on errors. Without some sort of approach to balance the introduction of new data, does the approach bias the dataset distribution causing the learned distribution to fail to generalize to other molecules?\n4) How different is the GOLF approach from the active learning technique presented by Kulichecnko et al. (2023)."

Dataset Limitation: The paper may be limited by the availability and diversity of datasets used for testing, potentially impacting the generalizability of the results.\n2. Complexity: It seems that the complexity of GOLF is not clearly discussed in the paper.\n3. Practical Implementation: Though the algorithm is not very complicated, this paper does not release code, which leaves me cautious about the practical implementation and complexity of the algorithm.\n\nOverall, while the paper presents valuable contributions, addressing these weaknesses could enhance its overall impact and relevance in the field of molecular conformation optimization."
