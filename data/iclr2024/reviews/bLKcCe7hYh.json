The authors propose a three-step approach to address these challenges:\n\n1. Layer-based color correction: This step rectifies the color inconsistency in different image regions by applying color correction to each layer of the image pyramid.\n\n2. Virtual warping: This step generates more viewpoint-diverse but color-consistent virtual views for color correction and 3D recovery. The authors show that virtual warping benefits color correction and edge sharpness.\n\n3. Spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement: This step is designed for more robust and accurate pose calibration in multi-camera systems. The authors demonstrate that this step improves the accuracy of depth estimation in large-scale outdoor scenes.\n\nThe paper includes experimental results on several datasets and comparisons with other methods. The authors show that UC-NeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis and improves the sensing capabilities of multi-camera systems."

It took me some time to understand why this work needs virtual warping and what are the differences between single-camera NeRF and multi-camera NeRF (since each camera in a multi-camera system can be deemed as a single camera).\n\n- The virtual warping step relies on the MVS method to generate dense depth maps, which may not generalize to street views (I'm not certain about this) and may need further pertaining.\n\n- In Eq.(5), the author does not explain what is $\\mathbf{b}$ and $\\mathbf{d}$ denote.\n\n- In Eq. (7), it is unclear whether the relative transformation $\\Delta \\mathbf{T}_k$ is optimized.\n\n- The final training loss is missing, e.g. $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{pho}} + \\lambda_1 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{reg}} +  \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{rpj}} $. \n\n- The pose refinement step is quite straightforward. Since the relative pose constraints $\\Delta \\mathbf{T}$ in the same rig can be obtained through calibration, I think it is naive to decompose the camera pose into the ego pose and a relative transformation $\\Delta \\mathbf{T}$. Moreover, the pose refinement step requires point correspondences, which could introduce outliers since it is well known that SOTA point matching methods are prone to repetitive structures and moving objects."

I think the author mentioned it in the introduction, but the case is not handled in the formulation (Eq. (7)).\n\n- Did you reimplement Zip-NeRF or use others' reimplementation of Zip-NeRF?

It should be justified. Besides, some existing NeRFs also addresses similar problem such as RAWNeRF and block-NeRF, what are the main differences between the proposed method and these works? \nW1-2 In terms of the spatiotemporally constrained pose refinement, there are some similar NeRFs that also consider the spatial and temporal connections between cameras for pose optimization.

They first handle extrinsic errors by SLAM and again do something similar to SLAM as post-processing to recalibrate the cameras across time. To handle color variation across cameras at a given time instant, an affine color correction matrix is learnt separately from sky and foreground (as they can get sky mask from previous work) and thus there are separate NeRF models. Since NeRF requires dense sampling of input images, they also propose to get novel views via a separate pre-existing MVS method and use that depth map to render novel views. These novel views are then added to the training set of images. A new NeRF optimizing function is then defined taking all these into account. The results show improvement compared to many existing SOTA methods."

                "value": "- First, I would like the title to be more specific. Its very misleading as the paper does use automotive setting (sky+fg) as necessary input. The title seems to suggest that its a generic method for uncalibrated cameras. Also all results are on automotive. Please correct it.\n\n- In Eq. 5, what is b and d. I think the authors missed defining those params.\n\n- In Eq.7, isn't it  better to reduce reprojection error as a function of direct 4x4 transformation between the cameras across time. For example directly modeling the transformation between cameras labeled T^i*delta_T1 and T^j * delta_T1 in Fig4. The reason for this is that at time t=0, its convenient to bring all the three cameras in Fig4 to the car's coordinate system, but later assuming that this transformation is fixed and won't perturb due to camera shake, bad roads, bumps etc. is an unrealistic assumption. Then propagating this incorrect assumption across time from T^i to T^j can lead to erroneous extrinsics estimation in Eq. 7.\n\n- When virtual views are created and added to the training set as discussed in Section 3.3, it has holes either due to low confidence or occlusion as shown in Fig 9, then how does the sky segmentation from Yin 2022 perform in these images. What happens to the mask value in the missing image regions in virtual view and how does in impact Equation 3.\n\n- The training strategy is not very clear. So, you train using Eq.4 upto some convergence, Then you get A and C color correction matrices. Then again you apply the corrected A and C matrices to virtual views in Section 3.3. Then you get color corrected virutal views. Then you again train the original set of spatial+temporal data but this time include virtual views? I think Section 3.5 needs more explanation because it joins all your individual modules and is critical to understand how the complete system is working.\n\n- Section 4.4 is redundant I think. It has nothing to do with the main goal of your paper and that space could have been used to explain your main parts e.g. Section 3.5 in detail.\n\n\n- In Fig5, the part of the image where the road appears to merge, the green region adjoining the bright sky appears to be hazy in the proposed result compared to Zip-Nerf results. In other words Zip-Nerf results are much sharper in that region. What could be the reason for that?"
