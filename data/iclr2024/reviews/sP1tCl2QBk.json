Sampling line segments rather than points produces an empirical estimate that is continuous and (almost-everywhere) differentiable.

The method is demonstrated on several problems: 2D inverse rendering, topology optimization, and convex hull approximation."

However, the choice to represent the indicator function on a grid seems puzzling when a great advantage of a sampling-based estimator coupled to automatic differentiation is the flexibility of the underlying representation.\n\nThe convex hull application seems the weakest to me. It looks like the generated approximate hulls are not even convex, nor do they contain all the points, so it is unclear how they would be useful in downstream applications such as collision detection. In any case, classical convex hull algorithms in low dimension are plenty fast and come with correctness and performance guarantees. Accordingly, any proposal to replace them with a learned \"oracle\" must clear a very high bar.\n\nMore generally, only a few results are shown, and the numerical comparisons in the topology optimization case only show a marginal improvement in objective function. It would be good to include at least a few more test cases and comparisons."

For example, rather than using a superposition of level sets of SIREN networks, one could just use SIREN directly. In what application domains do you see this sort of representation being uniquely advantageous?\n- The authors repeatedly emphasize that the method is only applicable in low dimension. Why is this? What would it take to extend the method to general dimension? What about to spaces other than $\\mathbb{R}^n$?\n- What are the island artifacts in the topology-optimized solutions using fiber sampling?
