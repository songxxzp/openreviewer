The latter, considered a baseline, is conspicuously missing from the \"performance of FedHyper\" section after being included in the cooperation analysis. The reason for this omission is unclear, and it restricts a full understanding of how FedHyper stands against established methods.\n3) The paper falls short in explaining the underlying reasons behind FedHyper's superior ability to fine-tune learning rates compared to its contemporaries, such as FedExp. The missing intuitive rationale or clear justification leaves the reader questioning why FedHyper is ostensibly more efficient. Addressing this would make the advantages of FedHyper more transparent and convincing."
