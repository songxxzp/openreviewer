Moreover, the paper does not compare AttEXplore against state-of-the-art approaches designed to address noise in heatmaps, such as LRP (composite rules), SHAP, or LIME.

                "value": "My main concerns include the motivation and the evaluation of this paper. \n\n### Motivation\nI am not entirely sure I understand the motivation of the paper. It looks like this paper accuses BIG and AGI of using the exact boundary of the underlying model, which fails to be generic to similar models with variations in the decision boundary? This is pretty counterintuitive to me as feature attributions are often perceived as local explanations at the given model and the given input. Why do we need to consider if the explanation generalizes other models? With that being said, generalizing to other decision boundaries may trade in the faithfulness of the underlying model (this would relate to my second question about faithfulness and I will explain later). \n\n### Generalization of Frequency-based Methods?\nThe motivation to alter features in the frequency domain is because there are works showing high-frequency features help the model to generalize better [1]. I am pretty worried the authors explain this conclusion as altering some features in the frequency domain helps to create examples that transfer better, especially for methods just proposed in this paper (Eq. 4 - 5).  Have you verified your adversarial examples actually transfer better? Can you provide some analytical results convincing me this helps better explore more decision boundaries? So far all descriptions are pretty hand-wavy.  \n\n### Evaluations\nIs the method faithful to the underlying model? It looks like to realize \u201ca more general adversarial input\u201d the proposed method manages to find an adversarial example that is much further to the decision boundary compared to the previous methods. I think authors may want to compare how much farther you go. It is pretty concerning to me that no matter how you adjust the feature generations in Table 3 and steps in Table 4, the proposed method has almost identical results on your metrics. Similar, no matter how you decrease $\\epsilon$ in Table 5, the results do not change at all. What should we make out of these results? Are they showing the proposed method may be actually unfaithful to something? BTW, using $\\epsilon=8$ is pretty huge and I think decision boundaries are usually much much closer than $8/255$ for models without adversarial training. \n\nI recommend testing INFD score [2] and run sanity check [3].\n\n### Ending\n\nUnlike doing detection or being more robust, I really think research works in explaining feature importance are not result-driven. Namely, it is not about being state-of-the-art on some scores. Not every attribution method uses deletion and inserting scores in baseline papers cited. There are a lot of discussions for the unreliability of feature attributions that are not cited here. It is fine to say \u201cwe do not care about those critiques but just want to improve the current method\u201d but it is important to point out *important flaws* in the existing methods and fix those. \n\n[1] Haohan Wang, Xindi Wu, Zeyi Huang, and Eric P Xing.
