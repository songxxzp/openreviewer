Treating each bifurcation as a node and path from root to leaf in the tree as a sequences of nodes on path to be modelled by the HMM. The approach is evaluated in its ability to infer properties of synthetic trees generated using a procedural modelling approach developed for the purpose as well as human airway trees extracted from a public medical dataset."

Could they instead be modeled using the (constant) branching process? Why are there hidden states, instead of constant branching factors or branching factors that are a function of depth? Basically, do the physical branching angles, rate of branching, etc., actually change?  \n* CT has imaging resolution on the order of mm (1mm isotropic is a very high quality human CT, multi-mm thick slice or gapped slices are standard clinical CT resolution). Do we expect the actual alveolar trees to be visible? If not, would these resolutions lead to non-tree like observations? (i.e., multi-compartment mergers)"

                "value": "1) I'm fairly certain the ELBO should be a lower bound. Why can we have the log inside of the integral/summand in equation (1) without an inequality? Usually the latent variables are introduced at this stage, then either the spectral gap is derived, or Jensen's inequality used.  \n2) One motivating factor for this work is rule heterogeneity. However, is this actually possible using these priors? I think this is what your experiments are trying to show in 3.2; I encourage the authors to work on this. Branching processes with differing rules based on interesting conditions can be very interesting in applied fields, but Figures 4 and 5 are incredibly small and unreadable, as are table 1 and 2, but even more importantly, the authors should use the synthetic data to prove that if such a rule shift (so, a regime change between lung tissue structures) existed, it could be learned by this HMM, and wouldn't have been learned by the fixed branching process.  \n\nAdditional notes: If the authors are set on using lung tissue, I feel a medical applied conference (MICCAI, MIDL, etc.) may be better suited for this type of contribution. While the HMM is interesting, its need within the application domain will not be appreciated by this community as much as a more medically inclined community."
