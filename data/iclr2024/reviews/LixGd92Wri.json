The authors introduce GDL-DS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of GDL models across scenarios that encounter distribution shifts. They provide a comprehensive evolution on several datasets from different fields; particle physics, materials science, and biochemistry, and categorize distribution shifts into three types: conditional, covariate, and concept shifts. Furthermore, they explore three levels of out-of-distribution (OOD) information access and evaluate multiple GDL backbones and learning algorithms. The benchmark consists of 30 experiment settings, and the findings provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the GDL domain."

                "value": "1. The use of critical terms should be better considered. Concept drift is a well-established term in the study of causality and distribution shift. As defined in [1], which the authors also cited, the only constraint for concept drift is \"changes in $p(y|X)$\". To avoid any confusions to readers, this conventional definition should be followed without modifications like $P(Y|X_c)$. Similarly for the definition of covariate shift. If the authors attempt to define a more specific kind of shift, another term should be used.\n\n2. The causal statements are problematic.\n    - The statement that $X$ consists of two disjoint parts and $X_i \u22a5Y |X_c$ does not hold. A easy violation would be $X_c \u2192Y \u2192X_i$. Intrinsically, $Y$ is often a property of the input and therefore $X$ cannot be divided into two disjoint parts that are causal/independent, but there would exist a part of $X$ that is statistically associated with $Y$ while non-causal to $Y$. A classic example is the PIIF and FIIF causal modeling, such as the analysis in [2].\n    - Following the above point, even for $X \u2192 Y$, $P(Y|X)P(X) = P(Y|X_c)P(X)$ does not hold. For $X \u2192 Y$, there can be a case where $P_S(Y |X_i)\\neq P_T (Y |X_i)$, which will also result in a \"conditional shift\". It is also included by the definition of concept shift. Constraining $Y \u2192 X$ does not seem like a necessity for conditional shift.\n    - Overall, as the foundation of the whole paper, 3.1 appears to be logically unclear and farraginous and needs major corrections.\n\n3. Contribution overclaimed and related works not well addressed. In the comparison with existing benchmarks, the authors claim no existing OOD benchmarks consider conditional shift, which is not true. OoD-Bench, GDS, and GOOD all include the Cmnist dataset, which is clearly conditional shift. GOOD also constructed conditional shift for each dataset. Also, though benchmarks like WILDS do not use test labeled/unlabeled data for algorithm learning, these OOD info are available. Therefore, Table 1 gas multiple overclaiming issues, and the authors should treat existing works properly.\n\n4. Experimental setting not fair. Some methods are trained solely on the Train-ID dataset, while DA algorithms are trained on both Train-ID and OOD input data, and TLs also learn labeled Train-OOD data. This does not seem like a fair setting since different methods are trained on even different numbers of data samples. Given that the analyses are conducted based on comparing all these methods together, a fair evaluation setting is certainly needed.\n\n5. Baselines out-of-date. These years many new OOD methods including new sota have been proposed. The benchmark should include more recent methods as baselines. For learning algorithms the sota methods on the Wilds leaderboard should be considered. For graph OOD methods, many recent methods can easily outperform DIR. Also, geometric methods specifically developed for scientific tasks should be considered.\n\n6. The benchmark includes only 3 datasets. Though more than one shift is identified for each dataset, this number seems a bit few for a benchmark. Given that the datasets are not newly collected, possibly more discussions on contributions like curating 3D coordinate can make up for the overall contribution.\n\n\n[1] A survey on concept drift adaptation\n\n[2] Invariant risk minimization"
