They show that in such a setting, the inner product between points on the same concept manifold will be lower than those on different manifolds, such that concept membership can, in principle, be performed with an inner product check. Furthermore, they show that random projections can be used to lower the sample complexity of membership checks to be quadratic in the effective number of dimensions of a manifold.\n\nThese theoretical results are then applied to a (theoretical) modification of the transformer architecture, in which the polynomial manifolds correspond to distinct conceptual subspaces (in much the same way the Mechanistic Interpretability community have conceptualized the transformers in the \"residual stream view\" [1]). In this proposed architecture the attention operation associates points lying on the same manifold most strongly (as per the inner-product findings above), and the MLPs are responsible for computing the signatures of each point (i.e. the separate concepts). Applied across multiple layers this amounts to a hierarchical computation of signature, and thus concepts, associated with the inputs.\n\nThe authors make their theoretical framework somewhat more concrete by providing examples of signatures corresponding to circles, moving objects and rotation-invariant point clouds.\n\n[1] Elhage et al. 2021 - A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits"

For example, there are good reasons to believe that Capsule-Nets should learn to hierarchically decompose complex objects into re-usable parts, but most of the existing literature on Part-Whole hierarchies has encountered great difficulties in being applied to non-toy datasets when training with e.g. gradient descent. As such, the lack of experiments makes it unclear that a reader is well-served to work through this theoretical paper, as it is not immediately obvious that theoretical guarantees around inner-product proximity and signature computation will reflect the learning of disentangled concept manifolds in practice.\n\nNitpick: \n1.
