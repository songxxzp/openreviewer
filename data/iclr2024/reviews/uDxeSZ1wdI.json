                "value": "This paper presents an object- or entity-centric RL algorithm for learning goal-conditioned manipulation. As object-centric representations, the authors use the Deep Latent Particles (DLP) method. The novelty is in the policy and Q-network, for which they propose an Entity interaction transformer (EIT), which is a transformer-based architecture to process the structured per-object latent representations. They test the method in an object manipulation task, with a robot manipulator and 2 static viewpoints provided as observations. They adopt a goal-conditioned RL setup, where the goal state is provided as target images, and introduce a Chamfer reward term to train the policy and Q function. The experiments show that their method can match the performance of another structured latent state method (SMORL), and outperform it when using image goals. Moreover, they demonstrate compositional generalization, where an agent trained on i.e. 3 colored cubes can generalize to a task with N colored cubes."

It would be interesting to see whether the approach can scale to various objects (for example YCB objects), and more cluttered scenes.\n\n- As hinted by the authors SMORL is more sample efficient, as it learns to manipulate a single object and can then generalize to the others.

The majority with full observability but some from pixels.\n\n- Works based on Interaction Networks, Propagation Networks and Graph networks. E.g., A. Sanchez-Gonzalez, N. Heess, J. T.

The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 17(1), 1334-1373.\n\nAs an aside comment, we can find similar table-top behaviours as the one presented here using LLMs, e.g., \u201cPalm-e: An embodied multimodal language model.\u201d\n\n**Methods:**\n\nThis sentence requires elaboration: \u201cObviously, we cannot expect compositional generalization on multi-object tasks which are different for every N.\u201d\n\nAssumption 1. Probably you are using a standard notation but please explain what is \\alpha* and v*.\n\nCould you explain the consequence of Theorem 2.\n\nWhy did you use off-policy algorithm TD3?\n\n\u00bfWhy do you need RL to train the DLP? It was mentioned that this module is pretrained, so no goal would be needed. Otherwise, you constraint the training for the defined goals that are set by the designer.\n\nGoal definition \u2013 Using the encoder. This is a common technique but prevents for proper generalization. How you would encode in this architecture non-predefined goals?, like move red objects to the left.\n\nParticles and only cubes. Using particles is very interesting, but evaluation with non-cube objects is not tested. This means that it could be that the experiments are assuming that the objects are point-mass entities. This would prevent generalization. In particular, the definition of cube-red as a single entity seems very restricted so you cannot perform behavioural operations on other shapes with different colours or other properties. \n\nAlso this rises the problem of permutation invariant, maintaining the identity of an object may is important in tasks that object permanence is needed for instance in dynamic-sequential tasks.\n\n**Experiments**\n\n\u00bfWhy adjacent goals require interactions? This can be solved reactively.\n\nI find very interesting the Ordered-Push. Should be the EIT trained for each task or it is trained on all tasks and the executed?\n\nI understand that you relegated the Chamfer distance to the Appendix, but it could be great that at least a written explanation is placed (or the equation) to understand how the rewards works.\n\nUsing this distance (and the L2)  as rewards why is RL needed, would it be enough to use a KL as objective function? Or are there other rewards used?\n\nWhat is state input? Full observability?\n\nThe agent is learning arm-object interaction thanks to the RL approach but it is not clear that the system is learning objects interaction.\nCompositional generalization. While I agree that training on N objects and then executing the task with less and more objects shows generalization capabilities. This does not necessarily endorses composition. \n\nCould you explain how the system changes when including more objects at the level of the  DLP and the EIT?\n\nBaselines: The text says: \u201cWe use DLP as the pre-trained OCR for this method for a fair comparison\u201d, but then SMORL is only compared in the results showed with \u201cstate\u201d access. Does this mean that this is without using pixels as input.\n\nIt is interesting that using RL also unstructured approach cannot handle the complexity. We obtained similar results using an ELBO loss. However, this makes the comparison too na\u00efve. As the comparison of your algorithm is against full observable (state) and unstructured.\n\n**Minor comments**\n\n- Please check open quotes, in latex you can use ``word\u201d\n- Self attention -> Self-attention"

Concurrently, the transformer component adeptly models the dynamics of the entities and their intricate physical interactions. The clarity of the conceptual foundation is commendable, and the results showcased, particularly in the challenging realm of image-based control, are robust and hold promise. Furthermore, the paper hints at potential advancements in the field of compositional generalization. Given these strengths, I am inclined to recommend this paper for acceptance, acknowledging its significant contributions and merits.

                "value": "I list the weaknesses and questions together here.\n\n**[About the matching]** \n\nI concur with the authors regarding the permutation invariant block in the EIT, acknowledging its potential to obviate the need for matching post-OCR. However, the rationale behind the decision to forego a straightforward matching step subsequent to OCR is not entirely clear to me. Is this choice motivated by a desire for increased flexibility, or are there other factors at play? From my perspective, matching algorithms can serve as modular, plug-and-play components, exemplified by their seamless integration in slot attention mechanisms as outlined in [1]. I recommend a more thorough elucidation of this particular point in the rebuttal, as it would greatly enhance the clarity and comprehensiveness of the explanation.\n\n**[About the evaluation]**  \n\nIn order to rigorously assess the contribution of each individual component within the algorithm\u2019s design, I recommend broadening the scope of the ablation studies conducted. Specific areas to consider include: (1) experimenting with alternative OCR methodologies in lieu of DLP, to evaluate the framework\u2019s adaptability and performance consistency across varying OCR techniques; (2) a detailed evaluation of the impact that each component recognized by DLP has on the ultimate policy learning. This is particularly pertinent for elements that do not share a direct correlation with dynamics and rewards, such as background features. \n\n **[About the compositional generalization]**  \n\n-  Can the method generalize to the case where the novel objects (e.g., different shape but similar to the ones seen in the training, e.g., cuboid versus cube) exist during the inference phase? \n\n- Does the model possess capabilities for both extrapolation and interpolation with respect to the quantity of objects involved? To illustrate, consider a scenario wherein the model is trained on sets of 2, 4, 6, and 8 objects, and subsequently tested on sets of 3, 5, 7 (interpolation) as well as 1, 9, 10 (extrapolation). While I acknowledge the presence of some relevant results in Figure 5, a more systematic and thorough analysis of the model\u2019s extrapolation and interpolation capabilities would be beneficial. This approach would align with the high-level conceptualization of generalization discussed in [2].\n\n **[About the interaction]**  \n\n-  I would appreciate additional clarification from the authors regarding the nature of entity interactions within the model. From my perspective, these interactions can be broadly classified into two categories: (1) interactions that influence dynamics without impacting the reward, and (2) interactions that affect both dynamics and reward. While I understand that the transformer is capable of capturing both types of interactions, a more explicit discussion on how it accomplishes this, and the implications of these interactions on the model\u2019s performance, would be highly beneficial and contribute to a more thorough understanding of the model\u2019s capabilities.\n\n- I am interested in understanding how the density and frequency of interactions influence the performance of policy learning within the model. Could the authors possibly quantify and assess the model\u2019s precision in predicting interactions across varying levels of interaction density and frequency? One potential metric for this evaluation could be the accuracy of the predicted entity state in comparison to the ground truth state, especially if direct interaction capture proves challenging within the simulator. I hypothesize that a reduction in workspace size, given a constant number of objects, is likely to increase interaction occurrences. Focusing on this aspect would provide valuable insights into the model\u2019s robustness and adaptability under different operational conditions.\n\n **[About the presentation]**\n\nMinor: I would recommend transferring the contents of either Appendix A or E to the main paper. This adjustment not only enhances the overall presentation but also efficiently utilizes the remaining available space (currently less than 9 pages).\n\n\n\n\n\n*References*\n\n[1] Locatello, Francesco, et al. \"Object-centric learning with slot attention.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 11525-11538.\n\n[2] Balestriero, Randall, Jerome Pesenti, and Yann LeCun. \"Learning in high dimension always amounts to extrapolation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.09485 (2021)."
