However, the use of CoT and PoT is a common idea used in many math papers.\n\nQuality: Good.

This is a fairly standard pipeline, and it seems that the main improvement comes from the intelligence of GPT-4. \n\nMoreover, the idea of hybird instruction tuning is a bit confusing. According to Sec 2.4, the authors will first run PoT, and if the program cannot execute, they will switch to CoT. It seems to be a very preliminary way to combing CoT and PoT together. I was thinking a better way could be interleaving CoT and PoT in the solution. \n\nThe fine tuning part of LLama is kind of straightforward, and there are many existing work using similar ideas. So I will not say it is an important contribution.\n\nOverall speaking, I think the main contribution of this paper is \"using GPT-4 to create a new dataset (which is a combination of many existing datasets), and fine tune Llama using the created dataset\". Therefore, I will say this paper has limited significance. I give weak accept mainly because I feel this is an important problem, and the authors provide a reasonably good solution."

The use of both CoT and PoT enables these models to employ distinct problem-solving approaches for different types of math challenges.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the commendable performance exhibited by MAmmoTH, several notable weaknesses should be acknowledged:\n\n**Limited Technical Novelty**: The approach employed in developing MAmmoTH bears resemblance to previous works, such as Orca (Mukherjee et al., 2023). In situations where an adequate reservoir of mathematical Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or Program-of-Thought (PoT) data is unavailable, the model resorts to generating content from scratch. While this approach serves as a valuable resource and addresses the scarcity of specialized mathematics models, it may not be considered a groundbreaking contribution without a more rigorous evaluation and innovative techniques.\n\n**Absence of an In-Depth Analysis of Training Data Distribution**: It is evident that each dataset contributes unevenly to the final training annotations. For instance, TheoremQA contains a mere 600 samples, raising questions about the true impact of incorporating such a small dataset. While it is reasonable to assume an enhancement in TheoremQA performance, it remains unclear whether this addition adversely affects the performance of other in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Additionally, there is a concern that the model's focus on other mathematics datasets may hinder its proficiency in learning TheoremQA.\n\n**Insufficient Ablation Studies on Training Dataset Influence**: The majority of ablation studies appear to be centered around GSM8K, with the authors incrementally augmenting the training data size atop GSM8K. However, there is a notable absence of alternative strategies, such as initially training the model on MATH and subsequently introducing other datasets in a stepwise manner. Another informative ablation study could involve the removal of individual training datasets, such as M + C + A + N, and G + M + C + N, to elucidate the specific impact of each dataset on model performance.\n\n**Lack of Comprehensive Error Analysis**: While MAmmoTH has demonstrated impressive performance, a detailed error analysis would provide valuable insights into areas where the model can further improve. The inclusion of illustrative examples could enhance our understanding of the model's strengths and limitations, aiding in the refinement of its capabilities."

I'm not sure what would be the quality of this dataset. I don't mind sharing my GSM8k training set for the authors to reproduce. \n2. In other words, I think the author should have more experiments to justify the datasets. For example, GSM8K PoT, we need to compare with a CodeLLaMA that trained on GSM8K PoT training set."
