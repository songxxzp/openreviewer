                "value": "I have two major concerns, which keep me from accepting the paper in its current state.\n\n1) Identifiability of counterfactuals. The paper claims to achieve (point) identification of counterfactual predictions. However, I believe point identification is only possible here because, in Proposition 3.4., the authors do not condition on the descendants of the sensitive attribute $A$. This is in strong contrast to the main claim of the paper to use **all** observed variables for counterfactual fairness, not just the non-descendants. Furthermore, it is inconsistent with the proposed counterfactual estimator on page 6., in which I believe the authors do include descendants of $A$. In general, estimating counterfactual predictions would require (at least implicitly) estimating the counterfactual descendants of $A$ (i.e., causal queries of the form $\\mathbb{P}(M_{A \\to a^\\prime} \\mid A = a, M = m)$, where $M$ are descendants of $A$. The identifiability theory of such causal queries is well-developed, and **counterfactual (point) identification is impossible** without imposing additional assumptions (Plecko and Bareinboim, 2022). Looking forward, I believe the authors have three options to improve the paper: (i) Imposing strong parametric assumptions on the data-generating process that enable counterfactual identification (and I think it is necessary that these assumptions are spelled out explicitly). (ii) Using a partial-identification approach, as done by Wu et al. (2019) for discrete variables. However, Melnychuk et al. (2023) showed that, for continuous variables, not even partial counterfactual identification is possible without imposing stronger assumptions. (iii) Choosing a weaker/less individualized (but identifiable) notion of fairness, such as interventional fairness (Kilbertus et al. 2017).\n\n2) Min-max approach for achieving counterfactual fairness. The authors motivate their approach with the toy example in Figure 1. However, if I understand correctly, the proposed approach would coincide here with the FAIR method, as the worst-case DAG would include both $X_1$ and $X_2$ as descendants. More generally: Why does the min-max approach proposed in the paper not coincide with the FAIR method that excludes all (possible) descendents of $A$? I.e., why does the worst-case DAG not always include all (possible) descendants as actual descendants? I could imagine that this would induce certain conditional independences that would violate the learned Markov equivalence class. But I think it is important that the authors provide some intuition here, either via a theoretical result or another toy example, that shows that the proposed max-min approach is not equal to FAIR."
