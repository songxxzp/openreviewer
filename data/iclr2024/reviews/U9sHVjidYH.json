                "value": "1. Upon reading the paper, my main question is whether the discovered relationship is causal, e.g. if starting with a higher initial attention rank/higher temperature leads to an improved performance. Indeed, if this holds, that paper has a high-impact recipe for improving the existing models. In the opposite case, I feel, an additional motivation for the study is required.\nImportantly, here the ultimate experiment does not seem to be too hard to execute: one only needs to take some standard existing model with a standard training setup (e.g., BERT, which is not too large by modern standards) and, using insights from the paper, find a training regime that improves its final test loss.\n\n\n2. S3.2: I am puzzled why only 4 train and 4 test examples were chosen for the illustrations. The plots represent averaged ranks, so why not having e.g. hundreds of points?\nFurthermore, while we say that ranks do not change over training, the bottom curves almost universally go down as the training progresses.\nAnother puzzling observation is that all curves are somehow clustered in two groups: either at the very bottom or on the very top of the Figures 1 & 2/left-center. This could happen, for instance, if steps in the temperature are too high and the models either (a) work nicely, (b) get relatively broken. Would it be possible to have more fine-grained steps here?\n\n3. Do the experimental results have another interpretation? What if the temperature has an impact on the performance directly, and that has nothing to do with the attention rank? Is there a way to refuse this interpretation?\n\n\nPresentation:\n1. As far as I can see, the details on how the rank is actually calculated only appear in S5.1 (SVD + threshold of 10^-8 on singular values). This should be mentioned earlier, before the first experiments that report rank measurements (S 3.2).\n2. High-rank targets are mentioned in S1, yet are only defined at the end of the paper. It would be great to have a short explanation straightaway, otherwise I found the claim a bit puzzling on the first reading.\n3. Almost everywhere the text uses \\citet in place of \\citep.\n4. Capitalisation in \u2018Transformers/transformers\u2019 is not consistent throughout the paper (eg S1 vs S3 & S5)."

A few of the observations made in the theoretical analysis and numerical validation are well-known for softmax with temperature hyper-parameter e.g. that it can sharpen and flatten the distribution. The low temperature setting leads to concentrated attention i.e. low-rank and in the high temperature leads to high-rank (i.e. uniform weights). \n- In terms of novelty, the analysis of rank in weight matrices has been explored in the compression-related literature for transformers e.g. [1, 2], It is not very well defined what is new here and how it relates to efficiency of transformers; the paper doesn't study efficiency-related  properties of transformers as the title suggests. \n- The main finding of the paper that increasing the rank through temperature scaling leads to higher performance is counter-intuitive. When we increase the rank, in the limit the softmax weights become uniform i.e. the role of learned attention weights gets ignored. \n- The claim that the increase in rank leads to better performance is not well supported; results are based on validation loss reported on two datasets and a toy task. It's unclear if the results would generalize to other tasks and different model scales.  \n- The assumptions made in the theoretical part are not necessarily valid for the real scenarios of transformers with softmax (instead of hardmax) and learned queries & keys (they are not necessarily independent). \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.00112.pdf\n[2] https://openreview.net/pdf?id=_sSHg203jSu"

                "value": "- Can the authors explain what is the usefulness of having a rank that is higher than the dimension d in Fig. 5? The softmax bottleneck dictates that the inner dimension of the factorization provides an upper-bound for the rank. By increasing the temperature to a very high-value we effectively create a uniform distribution that will always have rank equal to the sequence length but this is equivalent to ignoring the learned distribution by the model. It's unclear to me what is the benefit of this.  \n- What is the definition of \"efficiency\" and \"marginal utility\" after Eq. 8?  It was also not clear to me how the initial part from the this equation was derived; can the authors explain?\n- What is the task and training objective for IMDB and Wiki datasets? In the IMDB case, it would be useful to report the accuracy instead of the validation loss. I'd recommend repeat the experiments on a larger number of tasks to showcase that the results are broadly applicable."

If the relationship were causal, it seems we should expect to see better validation loss for higher head dimensions (with low temp), which is not the case.\n- The paper does not demonstrate that its insights related to attention rank can be used to make any meaningful improvements to transformer model architectures or training algorithms. The experiments in section 5.2 are very small-scale and overly synthetic, and thus unconvincing.\n- It doesn\u2019t make sense to me that for very large temperature values, the attention matrix approaches full-rank (Figure 5).
