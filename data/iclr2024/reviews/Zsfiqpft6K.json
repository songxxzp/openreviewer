In the second stage, the initial flow field is refined using a multiscale conditional diffusion model to predict dense correspondence between source and target models. Comparisons are provided with recent baselines and state of the art performance is demonstrated."

With this structure they are able to achieve competitive results compared to the SOTA in dense correspondence matching. The use of a diffusion model to model the data prior of their system implies that the proposed solution is actually a generative system that given an initial dense matching field can sample plausible output ones; as a by-product of this formulation the authors propose to model matching uncertainty as discrepancies in the sampling process with some preliminary interesting results."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "a) **Possible generalization concerns and limited experimental evaluation**: modeling a prior on what a good matching field looks like using a diffusion model exposes the proposed solution to generalization problems since the prior will only model the type of matching flows seen during training. For example in the extreme case where the method is trained only with match fields coming from homographies it will probably not generalize well to other types of non-rigid transformations between frames. The competitors have this type of limitation in a less pronounced way since they focus on improving feature extraction and matching rather than modeling a global prior on what a \u201cgood matching field\u201d should look like. Whether this problem arises in practice is hard to estimate from the current paper since the experimental validation is rather limited compared to the main competitors.T he proposed method is evaluated only on two datasets for dense correspondence matching and on two corrupted versions of the same datasets. Competitors like GOCor, PDCNet and PDCNet+ are evaluated on other datasets (e.g., MegaDepth and RobotCar) and additional correspondence tasks (e.g., Optical Flow on KITTI, Pose Estimation on YFCC100M and ScanNet).\n\nb) **Inference time concerns**: Tab. 5 of the paper compares the inference time of PDCNet(+) vs the proposed method with 5 sampling steps and shows that the two proposals are comparable. However in Sec. 4.6 the authors mention that in practice they sample multiple times and average the diffused fields to get the final performance. Depending on how many samples are drawn it will have an impact on the runtime making it grow significantly. From the current paper it is unclear if this multiple sampling strategy is used in the experimental validation ro only in Appendix C.2 and whether the inference time of Tab.5 are taking this into account or not. If not (as it seems like from the text) the inference cost will be significantly higher than competitors.\n\nc) **More ablation studies and unclear dependency on the initialization**: the core of the work is the use of a diffusion model to refine an initial estimation of a matching field ($F_{init}$). From the paper it is unclear how much the prior is able to recover in case of a bad initialization or not and whatever, if possible, the model will need more diffusion steps to recover from a bad conditioning. I would have liked these aspects to be discussed as part of the ablation study. Another interesting ablation that would have nicely complemented the work would have been using the dense cost volume as conditioning to the diffusion process. If the concern is around hardware limitations a test should still be possible at lower resolutions."

Could the proposed conditional denoising diffusion module be plugged on top of other dense correspondence methods to enhance their performance (possibly with retraining)? For example could step (b) of this method be combined with PDCNet+ to further boost the performance? \n\n\n### Suggestions\n\n* Tab. 6 in the appendix is a repetition of Tab. 1 in the main paper\n* I would suggest using a more obvious color map for Fig. 6 in the appendix, right now is a bit hard to parse.\n* I would also suggest rename DiffMatch to PDCNet+ for the qualitative comparison in Fig. 4-5 since that\u2019s the anime used in the table?"
