The divide-and-conquer framework seems to be a multiple path/view framework that has been extensively studied in the previous literature and it is not surprising that FreCoformer obtains competitive performance as it utilizes the information from both the time domain and frequency domain.\n2. Training/inference efficiency. The following question from point 1 is how is the training/inference efficiency of FreCoformer compared to other competing methods as it computes on different domains. The authors have only compared the GPU memory between FreCoformer and other methods, which is not the most important metric to evaluate the efficiency. For example, training time/number of parameters/FLOPs/GPU latency are commonly used metrics for efficiency evaluation.\n3. Core contribution. The authors have proposed lots of modules and designs in this work that may deviate from the core of 'divide-and-conquer'. For example, NYSTROM-FRECOFORMER just simply adopts the idea from NystromFormer and can hardly be claimed as the contribution of this paper. It is advised the authors rethink what in essence they are trying to present."

                "value": "**Insufficient novelty and contributions**\n1. I think there are the following contributions in this paper: patching frequencies and cross-feature and cross-frequency self-attention in  Transformers operating on frequency domains, Divide-and-Conquer method, and Nystr\u00f6m-FreCoformer. However, cross-feature and cross-frequency self-attention are almost similar to [1], [2], and [3]. Also, the Divide-and-Conquer method is quite similar to a variant of PatchTST [4] where a transformer part for temporal connections is changed into a linear one. Also, Nystr\u00f6m-FreCoformer is almost the same as Nystr\u00f6mformer [5]. As for the patching method on frequency domains, just domain is different from that of [4]. Therefore, I think that this paper just combines existing methods, and something new is not introduced. Therefore, to make more contributions, the authors have to propose stronger reasons why they combine such modules, or different parts from [1-5].\n\n**Insufficient explanation or experimental results for argument**\n1. According to 'Abstract', FreCoformer is designed for short-term variation while the divide-and-conquer framework is for long-term and short-term temporal variations. Can you give intuitive empirical evidence for this argument? \n\n2. In channel-wise attention, you design self-attention differently from the original one [6]. Why do you select your own design? Can you give some reason for this selection?\n\n3. In Section 3.3, the authors say that \"To compute the attention matrix A, we first select m landmark columns from the input Qn and Kn matrices in each channel.\". Can you give the detailed procedure to select $m$ landmark columns from entire ones?\n\n4. In Figure 3 (a), the authors say that \"Compared to the best-performing PatchTST, our model exhibits an advantage in identifying short-term variations, resulting in detailed fluctuations in periodicity variation.\" However, I don't know what parts show these results. Can you mark what parts provide this information?\n\n5. Additionally, there are some confusing parts.

                "value": "1. In 'Abstract', the authors argue that \"The patching process refines the frequency information, enhancing the locality.\". What kind of locality is enhanced by the patching process? Locality on the time domain is quite intuitive but one on the frequency domain is not. I think that you have to elaborate on locality on the frequency domain and why we have to utilize the frequency locality.\n\n2. In 'Abstract', there is a sentence saying \"The subsequent observations extract the consistent representation within different channels by attention computation and summarize the relevant sub-frequencies to identify eventful frequency correlations for short-term variations.\". What does 'Consistent representation within different channels' mean? I think that attention is capable of discovering relationships between different channels, not consistent representations within them. \n\n3. In 'Introduction', there is a sentence saying \"This approach relies on heuristic and empirical strategies, i.e., random or top-K\nfrequency selection, often capturing spurious correlations for forecasting (seen in Figure 1(c)).\". I think this is a too strong argument because Figure 1 doesn't directly provide evidence for spurious correlations.\n\n4. \"These independent attentions share model parameters across all sub-frequency learning, preventing winner-take-all of redundancy low-frequency components.\": About this sentence, Can you explain further? By just sharing the same Transformer's parameters across all sub-frequency learning, why is the phenomenon prevented that low-frequency components dominate against high-frequency ones?\n\n5. \"To demonstrate the efficacy of the core design\u2014channel-wise attention in FreCoformer, we visualized the heatmaps of the input and output DFT matrices of the Transformer encoder in FreCoformer in Figure 3(b).\" in Section 4.2.2: As far as I know [1], the DFT matrix is like a weight matrix to transform time domain into frequency domain. If the input length $N$ is the same, the DFT matrix always has the same value. What does 'DFT matrices' in the above sentence mean?\n\n6. \"This balance likely enables our method to efficiently extract pivotal frequency features across the entire frequency spectrum and various temporal variations, enhancing prediction outcomes.\" in Section 4.2.2: Why is balanced energy across entire frequencies helpful for your method? Can you give me more direct evidence for this sentence?\n\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFT_matrix"

The model is distinguished by its frequency patching operation, attention mechanisms for extracting consistent representations across different channels, and a divide-and-conquer framework for learning both long-term and short-term temporal variations. The paper also proposes a lightweight variant of the FreCoformer, employing the Nystrom method to reduce parameters and computational costs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. Innovative Approach: The application of patching in the Fourier domain combined with the use of Nystromformer is a novel contribution to the forecasting domain.\n\n2. Empirical Performance: The proposed model outperforms PatchTST in most experimental settings, indicating its effectiveness.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. From my perspective, the term *divided-and-conquer* is a little bit over claim. I would expect the divided and conquer type model to have a tree structure or multi-scale design. The authors couple an attention block within the Fourier domain and an MLP-type block for the first-order difference sequence, which, in my mind, is just kind of a dual structure. If the authors think divided-and-conquer term indeed reflects the spirit of the proposed model, it would be better to add more discussions on it.\n\n2. The test data loader in the provided sample codes sets `drop_last = True`, leading to the exclusion of several test samples. Correcting this and rerunning the experiments would enhance the validity of the results.\n\n3. The random control experiments seem not included. The model variance and hyperparameter-sensitive analysis may help to further highlight the efficiency of the proposed model.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1.  The paper describes using Attention in the Fourier domain and MLP in the time domain. Could the authors provide more insight into this specific design choice? Why not use Attention layers or MLPs in both domains?\n\n2. In the code, the time domain considers both trend differences and local differences. However, in section 3.2 of the main paper, only the first-order differences are mentioned. Does it only correspond to the local differences or both trend/local differences? \n\nAt the current stage, I tend to recommend accepting this paper if the numerical experiment results are updated. However, my final decision is open to change pending the authors' rebuttal and further discussions with other reviewers and the Area Chair."
