From equation 1, I understand the authors want to decompose the prediction task into two parts: getting hidden variable z and then predicting the answer with the hidden variable. However, it's not clear whether equations 2-6 are necessary. Could you provide more intuition behind for explanation? \n\n      Even if motivation exists, I'm not sure why equation 3 holds. Why is there only one path / relation path and it's faithful? For example, there could be multiple solutions/paths; if so, equation 3 might not hold. The authors should provide more justification for the equation 3.\n\n2. One of the key points in the framework is the finetuned LLM (i.e., \\theta). However, in the main paper, it's not clear how the LLM is finetuned. It seems the objective functions follow the equation 7. However, these two modules are not evaluated individually and there is no validation loss provided. Only the final framework performance can prove that these modules work as expected, which is not sufficient for readers to know why they can work.\n\n3. Over-claim sentences. The authors claim that their RoG framework can address the hallucination issue and lack of knowledge issue. However, studies with several cases are definitely not sufficient to prove them. I would suggest adding more comprehensive results or changing the claim."

In the next line, $z \\in Q$ does not make sense as $Q$ is a probability distribution. Also, the equality does not make sense as there is a CONST in equation 4. Also, I don't think it's a good idea to use equality for an approximation. Similar nonregorousness happens in equation 6. The marginalization in equation 10 does not make sense, as the authors are marginalizing over the conditions. The correctness of the final training objective needs to be double-checked.\n\n2. More datasets to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method would be great, as there are currently only two in the paper. Would the fine-tuned LLM generalize to other QA datasets, in addition to the datasets that it is fine-tuned on?\n\n3. About RoG as a planning module for other LLMs: I understand that the fine-tuned LLM can also be combined with other LLMs, and improve the performance of these not fine-tuned LLMs. However, according to Table 4, even combining with a stronger LLM (e.g. ChatGPT) cannot improve upon the original fine-tuned LLM.

If the baselines are only trained on one of the datasets each time, then it's not fair to compare RoG with them, if RoG is trained on both of them at the same time. \n\nI'm willing to raise my score if my concerns are properly addressed."

A compelling 'Reasoning on Graphs' (RoG) approach is introduced to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs by leveraging the structural information of Knowledge Graphs (KGs).  The RoG concept emphasizes the importance of KGs' relational structures in the reasoning processes. The proposed method consists of a planning-retrieval-reasoning framework that generates relation paths grounded by KGs, which serve as reliable plans for subsequent reasoning tasks. These plans guide the retrieval of valid reasoning paths that facilitate faithful and interpretable reasoning by LLMs. The paper addresses two main issues prevalent in previous methods: the tendency of LLMs to produce hallucinated content and the underutilization of KGs' structural data. RoG is optimized through planning optimization, which distills KG structure into LLMs, and retrieval-reasoning optimization, which enables LLMs to produce accurate, KG-supported conclusions. The paper also situates RoG in the context of existing research, identifying its methodological advancements over semantic parsing and retrieval-augmented reasoning approaches."

Then feed the instantiated paths that use the actual entities back to the LLM to find the answers that are more faithful to the path of reasoning and less pruned to the hallucination. The experiments are done over two KGQA benchmarks with up to 4 hops of reasoning.  Multiple LLMs (GPT, T5, LLAma, Alpaca) are used and tested.
