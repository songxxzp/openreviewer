                "value": "This paper defines the notion of \"feature collapse\" which relates to the intuition that entities that play a similar role should receive similar representations. This notion is made precise for a toy NLP task. Here, labels are invariant to substitutions of input tokens within certain equivalence classes. The paper then studies, both theoretically and empirically, under what conditions tokens within such an equivalence class are assigned similar representations, i.e. \"feature collapse\" has occurred. The paper shows that for this toy task, feature collapse corresponds to stronger generalization in the presence of tail tokens. The paper also empirically shows that feature collapse only occurs when the network includes layer norm. Otherwise, the norm of representations depends on the frequency of the tokens in the training data. A major contribution is a theoretical proof that explains why the magnitudes of the learned representations depend on their frequencies."

For example, the connection between feature collapse and generalization outside the context of the toy task does not seem to be well established. Additionally, the degree to which feature collapse sufficiently occurs or does not occur in the context of more realistic models and tasks is not clear. While perhaps not strictly necessary for such a theoretical paper, addressing such questions would have improved the motivation for this work.\n* The role of the L2 regularization term in equation 2 could be clarified. The authors state \"The regularization terms play no essential role apart from making proofs easier; the empirical picture remains the same without weight decay\". Could the authors include the experimental results that support this claim? This also seems to diminish (although not completely) the key theoretical contribution. It is not surprising that in the presence of L2 regularization, feature magnitudes would depend on their frequency in the training data. It would be more interesting if we had theory that elucidated why the learned embeddings for rarer tokens have lower magnitude in the absence of explicit regularization.\n\nMinor typos:\n\n* Intro paragraph 1 - \"gives same features\"\n* Intro contribution bullet 1 - \"how a network learn representations\""

Therefore, to the extent that the magnitude of word embeddings relates to their salience in making predictions, it seems that feature collapse may not be strictly desirable in such a setting."

Maybe a simpler and more intuitive experiment to demonstrate this \u201cfeature collapse\u201d behavior, is to assign two embeddings (to be learned) to one token, but during training this token is randomly mapped to these two embeddings, and see if these two embeddings become similar after training.\n2. Does the condition assumed on \u03bb (in Thm. 2) align with the choice of \u03bb in experiments? \n3. Can we empirically verify the feature collapse in deeper layers?\n4. I have concerns about the difficulty of learning equivalence from the data by the model itself without special treatments, including data augmentations and introducing explicit invariance into models. I think the root is: if the optimization objective is not the equivalence, the network could ignore the equivalence and just memorize the data. Another related and broader phenomenon is the failure to learn \u201cA = B\u201d equals to \u201cB = A\u201d in language models [1]. In computer vision, semantically equivalent inputs (pixels, small image patches, whole images, etc.) may not lead to the same feature, for both early layers and deep layers/final outputs. This is easy to understand, because even for contrastive learning where the network is forced to learn invariant features under augmentations, different views (augmented images) cannot guaranteed to lead to the same feature after training.\n\n[1] 'The Reversal Curse: LLMs trained on \"A is B\" fail to learn \"B is A\"' 2023."
