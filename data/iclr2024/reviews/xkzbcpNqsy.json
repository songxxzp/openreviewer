                "value": "1. It is claimed that the intuition for the methodology is that energy function is related to covariate marginal p(x), which plays an important role in covariate shift. While this is correct at a high level, i) the regularizer used is weighted average of p(x^tr). ii) the weights are based on influences over validation loss. However, the validation set is a sample from the source domain. Hence the regularizer essentially maximizes the log-(unnormalized)-likelihood of p(x^tr) (source domain). So it is not clear why this regularizer may help covariate shift ?\n\n2. Results of pro3.1 and  Lemma3.2 seem quite straightforward, essentially trying to prove that conditionals could be same while marginals may be different. I am not sure if they add any insight to the present work.\n\n3. I agree that Eq12 implies there is sample-reweighting happening. However, while classical methods employ the covariates from target domain (unlabelled), the proposed uses influence based weights on validation set, which is from the source domain. So it is not clear why this may help in covariate shift.\n\n4. Results in section4.1 seem a bit out of place because the test/validation is from the source domain. So we already know that influence functions reflect the correlation. I do not think a separate evaluation is required for this. If the same is shown for test/validation loss over the target domain, then it may be interesting. \n\n5. The improvements in table3 seem marginal.\n\n6."

Also, assuming the \"margin\" in (12) is the coefficient (p(y/x)- 1/(1-\\beta(x))), irrespective of \\beta >0 or <0 , it seems to decrease. So I am missing something here.\n3. The influences in fig 2 seem to be negative for both the frequent and rare classes. So why is there supposed to be a pullup effect on one and pull down on the other ?"

Formally, covariate shift and label shift are different kinds of shifts that rely on different kinds of corrections. Maybe I am missing something but the authors need to make it clear how their method really solves the label imbalance problem when their weights and margin corrections do not depend on Y. \n\nFurther, CMNIST, VLCS and PACS cannot be purely classified into label or covariate shift. They is style shift in PACS which can take the test distributions completely out of the support of the training, and CMNIST has shifting spurious correlations. How is the proposed method supposed to handle those, especially when run with ERM? Including these experiments gave me a lot of pause beyond just the conceptual issues because it is unclear whether IEAR is actually better. \n\nThe other image experiments seem clean but I have one question. Why not do the Imagenet/iNaturalist experiment with all the class sets combined? What is the virtue of doing the evaluations separately? It seems that each validation set is improving only the correspond test set but worse than cRT/LWS. This seems to point to the fact that the proposed method requires more care to run than the baselines."

Is the takeaway here that the problems that occur in the dataset considered purely due to optimization issues? If that is the case, can the authors connect the method to others like LDAM and importance weighting either formally or intuitively? What kind of differences exist in how different samples are weighted between these methods?\n\n\nAlso, see weaknesses."
