To that end, the authors propose an optimal regularization for training a two-layer linear neural network. This loss incorporates a regularization term inspired by the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC). The authors show that this loss represents an upper bound for the predictive regression error. Moreover, the authors show that the upper bound can reach a lower bound using Bayes optimal risk. The authors compare ridge regression with the proposed optimal regularization, highlighting a set of cases and examples where optimal regularization yields better results, showing when good regularization leads to greater learning."

Explaining theoretically why a neural network is able to outperform classical linear models through efficient feature learning is an interesting problem even in the simple framework of a linear two-layer network.\n\n2- The proof that the proposed regularization allows us to obtain the lower bound given by the optimal Bayes is also interesting since it justifies the optimality of the approach showing that the approach allows us to obtain the best performance in this class of functions of linear two-layer networks. In addition, the comparison with ridge regression and the illustration of specific cases where feature learning can dominate a non feature learning approach is also interesting.\n\n3- Even though few experiments have been carried out, they tend to suggest that regularization does in fact enable good performance to be achieved compared with conventional ridge regression."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1- The methodology and design of regularization in neural networks seem arbitrary. They suggest that the regularization used in previous cases is applied to neural networks, and by chance, it provides an upper bound of the true risk and constitutes a lower bound. The author postulates that this type of regularization appears implicitly in neural networks. The question is why this regularization is exploited by neural networks and not another that would also allow reaching the Bayes risk. For example, in recursive feature machines where authors apply an optimal feature learning step and a ridge regression step, one could expect results that reach the lower bound. One could say that it is possible to look for regularization that already exists in the literature or create new ones that will also show that it is an upper bound of the predictive loss and lead to a lower bound of the Bayes risk. But how can we ensure that the regularization proposed by the authors is unique and actually the one implicitly used by linear two-layer Neural Network? Otherwise, it is possible to write a lot of studies with different regularizations. The only thing we seem to be sure of is that ridge regression is not optimal.\n\n2- Along the same lines, one could ask whether this regularization is not optimal in the restricted setting considered by the authors (hypothesis on the data, generative model considered for the data, zero mean data, etc.). In a neural network study, one would expect to study the learning dynamics that naturally bring out the learning model and the implicit regularization that could also depend on the type of data and not be generic. And probably not the reverse: propose an arbitrary regularization and showing by its properties (lower bound of Bayes risk, upper bound of predictive risk) that it is the actual regularization achieved by linear neural network.\n\n3- Even though the theoretical contributions are important, it would have been interesting to illustrate the theoretical conclusions a bit more. In particular, it would have been interesting to compare the W learned by a linear NN network (without the regularization proposed (by a gradient descent method, for example)) and compare it to that obtained by regularization. This could represent an empirical argument that the actual learning process follows that of the proposed regularization. It would also be interesting to test the robustness of the conclusions on real data to see how dependent they are on the model considered and not obsolete for real data."

I think this question is interesting, but maybe it's not related to the learning process in real NN. At least, even if implicit regularisation doesn't explain all the phenomena, it is implicitly given by the learning process and the dynamics of learning. Also, this question seems a bit challenging and too broad as I would expect this regularisation term to depend on the data modelling under consideration.\n\n3- I think some explanations would have been welcome for assumption 1. Why do you consider putting the sub-Gaussianity assumption on the rows of $X\\Sigma_x^{-1/2}$ and not on the rows of $X$?\n\n4- The explanation at the end of page 4 and the beginning of page 5 is confusing to me. A lot of information is given, sometimes without any link, and some terms are not explained. In particular, several topics are mentioned in the same paragraph which are not related to each other (decay of eigenvalues for benign overfitting, high dimensional regime considered for $d, n$, ...). Furthermore, the kernel regime is not defined.\n\n5- In numerical experiments, it would have been fairer to tune the regularization parameter for ridge regression and take the best one. What if the poor performance of ridge is only due to a bad choice of the regularization parameter?  It would have been interesting to add the important baseline that would train a linear neural network as usual on the synthetic data and also some real data, at least to show the robustness of the approach with respect to the data distribution and the model considered."
