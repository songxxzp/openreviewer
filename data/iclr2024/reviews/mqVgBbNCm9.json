Experiments show that this approach can speed up decoding by up to 2.39x and improve the quality of answers in about half the prompt categories & models that they considered based on Fastchat and LLM zoo evaluation. In addition, they propose a backoff strategy that allows to combine the best of sequential decoding and the proposed procedure which leads to better quality overall albeit at the expense of lower decoding speed of up to about 1.8x."

One key weakness of the proposed decoding method is that the generations happen for different bullet points of a reply are independent from each other, limiting its use to answers that require chain-of-thoughts. Hence, it is applicable to specific type of replies and is sensitive to the instruction following abilities of the model that is being applied to, which limits its generality. \n2. The proposed method requires prompting the model with a large number of additional tokens to generate continuations for each different bullet point per reply; the number of tokens increases linearly with the number of bullet points. This has both memory/inference cost and latency implications that are not clearly exposed when discussing the main results.\n3. When the method is applied without the backoff strategy its quality benefit is not very clear as the improvement is observed in about half the models and categories according to FastChat and LLMZoo evaluations combined.\n4. There is no direct comparison to alternative methods that have been proposed for speeding up decoding in autoregressive models such as quantization, batch inference, and speculative decoding. For instance, a simple baseline would be to perform quantization and then apply multi-stage prompting to improve quality for certain categories."

Can the authors quantify this? It would show a more clear picture of the tradeoffs involved. \n- What is the speed up of the proposed method for different prompt sizes, especially the large ones? It would be useful to show the  improvement for replies that require an increasing number of bullet points to answer. \n- In hybrid model case, do you take into account the time required to query the LLM on whether to employ SoT or not? It would be useful to show if it introduces overhead and to what extent. \n- Have you tried prompting the model to generate arbitrary partial answer segments other than bullet points to perform continuations on them in parallel? That could potentially make the method applicable beyond answers that require specific bullet point structure.\n-  For the quality results in section 3.2.1, what is the average absolute scores achieved per category and across all categories overall when showing quality per model?"

In other words, the idea of this article is not insightful because it is very straightforward.

If the purpose of this paper is acceleration, then SoT is not universally applicable. The experiments in the article demonstrate it can lead to a decline in the quality of tasks such as code generation. More importantly, because the length (autoregressive steps) of each point the LLM needs to generate varies, the actual acceleration ratio in online-serving may differ from the test scenarios presented in the article, e.g., batch size=1 or batch size > 1\n3. I  personally doubt how much parallel generation of n points (i.e., SoT) actually enhances the user experience. \nConsidering that people read from left to right, generating n points in parallel may not significantly improve the reading experience for users. Instead, we should consider how to accelerate the generation speed of each point. As long as this speed is slightly faster than human reading speed, users might not perceive generation speed as a significant issue, because they also need time to understand the information from the LLM."

Nonetheless of its simple architecture, the router module reduced failure cases where SoT underperforms normal sequential generation, in exchange of reduced speedup."

Especially having a large number of LLMs tested is helpful for gaining insights into variability and sensitivity of the models and setting expectations for applying the method to other models. There\u2019s also a large number of analyses and more results in the appendices, which overall give the impression that the authors have profoundly studied the effectiveness of their method."

I do not think this makes the method any more attractive, and would prefer to see a discussion with scientific evidence, if this should be a benefit of this method. It is clear that the inspiration comes from how humans draft a text or the like - but this does not result in humans and LLMs functioning in the same way. The phrasing that LLMs are made \u201cthinking in the same way\u201d just adds fuel to the pseudoscientific discussions around whether LLMs are \u201cthinking\u201d or not (especially the phrase \u201cpushing LLMs to think more like a human\u201d). In addition, there is no connection between the argument of efficiency and human thinking - is it for efficiency that humans derive a skeleton first?\nMissing comparison to previous orthogonal methods proposed for speedups: Where on Figure 1b would they be located? This is necessary to understand the impact of this work in context of the previously proposed and adopted solutions.\n- The title is misleading and alludes to a new ability of LLMs (\u201cLLMs can do\u201d): The actual LLM decoding process is technically still sequential and there is no modification to the LLMs decoding loop (not to be confused with non-autoregressive methods), it\u2019s just that the model is prompted to provide a decomposable answer to be elaborated in parallel. A more concise (but probably not great for selling the paper) reformulation of the title would be \u201cLLMs can be prompted to provide decomposable answers\u201d.\n- The limitations of the method are not clearly articulated in the introduction: until Section 3 it is not clear that this method is limited to specific types of questions and that there is prompt-specific sensitivity. It might be obvious to the authors, but for positioning the paper in the right scope, this should be mentioned in the introduction.\n- An analysis of the effect of added length is missing: Since skeleton-of-thought prompting produces longer answers than the usual prompting (3.1.1), there might be a bias of certain evaluations to prefer more wordy answers even if they have the same contents. Similarly, it remains an open question how the length part (\u201c3-5 words\u201d/\u201d3-10 points\u201d/\u2026 see prompt examples) of the prompt should be optimally configured."

This kind of plot is answering the question for the speed-quality trade-off at one glance, so it would be great to have as well for LLMZoo. It looks like the model with the largest wins (StableVicuna-13B) also has the lowest speed-up for LLMZoo (3.2.2), so it would be nice to see if this is a trend more than for FastChat.\n- I do not think that Figure 3 is very expressive, as it is an accumulated result across all models, which in turn (3.2.2) vary largely. Perhaps this could be replaced with a deeper analysis of the loss cases? This would allow the reader to get a better idea of the potential risks.\n- The method reminds me of the map-reduce paradigm, but the reduce step is a simple concatenation rather than a joint processing of the whole list of answers. How much would a final \u201csummarize\u201d decoding step add to the quality and remove from the efficiency? I could imagine this increasing the coherence of the answers.\n- For 4.3.1 the most relevant question seems to be which ratio of questions the router decides to process with skeleton-of-thought. This directly affects efficiency, since speedups can only possibly be obtained if the skeleton-of-thought route is chosen. Quality and efficiency both seem to be a predictable combination of normal decoding and skeleton-of-thought decoding quality and efficiency once the ratio is known. It would be interesting to report this ratio by category in order to evaluate if it agrees with the categories that were identified to work well for skeleton-of-thought in 3.1.2."

Yet this paper gives no discussion. Below I list several references [1][2] (but clearly not sufficient).\n- The proposed method only makes sense when the answer is long, decomposable into several key points, and the interdependence of these key points is low (because the writing of each point only sees the skeleton). \n- As a result, the proposed method inevitably hurts the overall coherence of the answer. The experiments in this paper also confirm that the proposed method hurts the immersion and coherence judged by GPT4 (Section 3.2.4).\n-  All evaluation is conducted by GPT4 or ChatGPT-3.5. The results could be biased or misleading, human evaluation is required.\n\n[1] A Hierarchical Neural Autoencoder for Paragraphs and Documents (ACL15)\n\n[2] Long and Diverse Text Generation with Planning-based Hierarchical Variational Model (EMNLP19)"
