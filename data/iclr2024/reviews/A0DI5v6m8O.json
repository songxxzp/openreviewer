                "value": "The paper addresses the challenge of offline design optimization in various scientific and engineering contexts, where physical or computational evaluations are costly, making real-time optimization impractical. The traditional solution has been to utilize surrogate models based on offline data to predict the objective function for unknown inputs. However, these surrogate models often show discrepancies from the true objective function, particularly outside the range of the offline data. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework to understand this discrepancy by looking at how well the surrogate models match the latent gradient of the true function. Based on this theoretical insight, the authors propose a new algorithm, MATCH-OPT, that aims to match the gradients of the oracle more closely. The efficacy of this approach is supported by experiments on real-world benchmarks, showing that MATCH-OPT outperforms existing methods in offline optimization tasks."

The paper frequently refers to \"the gradient fields of the Oracle (i.e., the true objective function).\" It's essential to note that a true objective function doesn't inherently possess a gradient. Continual mention of the oracle's gradient is foundational to this paper, and this assumption should be explicitly clarified by the author. I think this is the key drawback. If the author can clarify this point, I will increase my score.\n\n2. The paper seems to overlook crucial baselines. It would be beneficial to reference and juxtapose the presented work against established benchmarks such as NEMO (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07970), CMA-ES, BO-qEI, BDI (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07507), and IOM (https://openreview.net/forum?id=gKe_A-DxzkH).
