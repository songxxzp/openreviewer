This paper aims to address this challenge through universal self-supervisions, which involve training an Encoder model on various datasets and pretext tasks to obtain universal embeddings.

Since the aim of this paper is to learn universal node embeddings, it would be interesting to explore how the approach adapts to new datasets where a graph-specific encoder has not been learned.\n\n**Concerns about the experiments**:\n \n- The experimental setup used in this paper appears to be unconventional. Firstly, the authors explicitly choose NAGhormer as the encoder, which avoids direct comparisons with traditional self-supervised methods based on message-passing GNNs. However, NAGhormer does not seem to be the primary contribution of this paper. I recommend that the authors consider conducting experiments with a GCN-based encoder and compare their approach with standard graph-specific self-supervised models, such as contrastive methods.\n- Furthermore, in the experimental section, the authors claim to use PairSim as a self-supervised task. While I am well-acquainted with self-supervised learning on graphs, such as contrastive methods and graph autoencoders, I am not familiar with PairSim. It is crucial that the authors provide a detailed explanation of the self-supervised task they use, preferably in the form of an objective function. They should also clarify why they chose this particular task, and if a different task (such as contrastive learning) were adopted, what impact it would have on the experimental results.\n- Lastly, the experimental results provided by the authors are not particularly convincing. The results in Table 1 appear to be rather perplexing, as the authors did not clarify the dataset splits, which, to my knowledge, do not align with the common splits used for the corresponding baselines. Furthermore, the authors claim that their proposed method narrows the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised models, but the experimental results do not seem to support this claim. I would suggest that the authors reconsider conducting experiments under more widely adopted self-supervised settings, such as those used in contrastive learning and masked graph autoencoder methods."

However the paper actually differs from these papers since it implicitly assumes that the have graphs with node attributes from different domains or with different dimensions. It is generally suitable for those big graphs with node-level/edge-level downstream tasks. But the authors do not make this point very clear.\n3. In the experiments, the choice of the self-supervision task in our study is guided by the downstream task.

As we know, graph datasets usually come with different node/edge features, which significantly hinders the study of transfer learning and foundation models. The authors adopt a simple approach to map the raw features from different domains into one shared feature space, and then train a shared graph encoder on top of the universal space. The pipeline makes sense to me and shows some promising results.\n3. The framework seems to show some transferability. For example, when trained on [CoraFull, Cora-ML, DBLP, Citeseer, PubMed] and adapted on Arxiv, the result is better than performing SSL only on Arxiv itself. This demonstrates that training a shared graph encoder given a universal feature space can indeed help transfer learning.\n4. In section 8.5, the authors show that including graphs with a larger domain gap negatively affects the quality of the universal embeddings. This finding is consistent with my understanding and it'll be better if the authors conduct more experiments to further demonstrate it."

The authors must explain the gap between the results reported in the manuscript and the ones commonly found in related literature.\n2. How to do the self-supervised learning (PairSim)? How to define the 'similar' or 'dissimilar' nodes without label information? Please add the equation of the training objective to the revised version.\n3. The results in Table 1 are strange. In conventional graph-ssl literature, e.g., DGI[1], the performance of supervised GCN and SSL variants is close. However, in Table 1, there is a significant gap between the supervised baseline and SSL methods for some datasets. \n4. Why add an additional data augmentation step before feeding into the linear layers? The authors should conduct an ablation study to show the effect of such graph-aware augmentation. \n5. If the authors want to claim transferability (so-called Adaptability in the manuscript) of their framework, more experimental results and analysis should be included. Only the result on Arxiv is not convincing enough.\nOverall, this paper is interesting in its research question, and the overall framework also makes sense to me. However, many technical details are missing and reproducibility is limited.  \n\nReference:\n[1] Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Petar, et al. \"Deep graph infomax.\""
