It takes existing 3D molecule genration setup with diffusion models and transforms it into latent diffusion, which is a known concept in general and some latent 3D models do exist (e.g. GEOLDM), using mostly off the shelf architectures.\n\nOne of the main contributions of this work is the cascaded auto encoder and main motivation for why it is needed stems from the fact that one-shot AE effectively failed to train. I find it a bit strange that the one-shot AE fails to train completely as there are 3D molecule generative models that generate 2D and 3D graph features jointly (e.g. MIDI or the example I reference in the paragraph below). They do usually re-weight the losses for 2D and 3D terms, but they do work. So I would like to see a more detailed analysis on why it doesn't work and potentially an ablation on the one-shot AE architecture and losses. I can understand one-shot AE working worse than the proposed cascaded AE with teacher forcing, but it essentially performing like a random initialization makes me wonder if it was tested sufficiently carefully.\n\nAs I also point out below, it would make sense to use for example https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17296.pdf as the baseline instead of an older EDM model, even though that paper is somewhat recent, so I understand its exclusion for the initial version of the paper.

How fast is the AE training? In terms of wall time, but also asymptotically (in O notation)? Without knowing this the comparison of training time of the proposed method vs EDM is also a bit complicated. As I understand Table 4. does not account for the AE training time (yes, it can be trained once, but it still needs training).\n\nAlso, since AE is trained on a much larger dataset, it might be fair to also pre-train the EDM on general molecule genration. It has been shown that pretraining helps molecule generation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17296.pdf). While this paper is quite recent it would still make more sense to compare against such properly tuned state-of-the-art molecular diffusion setup instead of vanilla EDM, which is an older baseline (first ever diffusion model for 3D molecule generation).\n\nWhy is MIDI, which is cited numerous times in the paper is not compared against in the experiments? It does in certain metrics perform a lot better than the EDM, which is used as the main baseline here.\n\nAlso, in 3.2 Setup sections authors say that connectivity is commonly later determined based on domain rules and cite MIDI among others. Its true, that such domain-based rules are used to recover connectivity in e.g. EDM, but in MIDI connectivity is modeled explicitly if I remember correctly?"

It naively mentioned that the authors borrow the architectures from previous works and such simple comment is not self-contained, in my opinion.\n\nHowever, let's assume that this issue is okay with me. Then, the following question is ... why the latent space is typically important to the graph generation? I know that the several recent studies utilize the latent space for the representation of the diffusion-based generative models. Nonetheless, I could not find any theoretical analysis behind the bridge between \n\n- _'the necessity of the latent space'_  and \n- _'the properties of the 3D graph representation, typically for the 3D molecules'_. \n\nFor me, this is naive extension of latent diffusion models into graph representation.\n\n# W-2. Overclaim.\n\nCan the authors exactly prove this equation in Sec 3 of this manuscript?\n\n_3D Graph Diffusion Performance <= Latent Space Reconstruction Quality + Symmetry Preservation * Data Dimensionality_\n\n # W-3. Lack of experiments\n\nIf the main contributions of this paper is about the analysis of the latent space into the 3D graph representation, I think that the authors should have provided the clear results or ablation study about the this contribution. \n\nFor instance, using the same baseline model from (Hoogeboom et al., 2022), the authors could slightly modify the architecture while maintaining the number of parameters for fair comparison.

For instance in the manuscript, the authors said that '__Proposition 1.__ _Performance bound of 3D graph diffusion is related to feature dimensionality_'.\nIn my opinion, simply if we increase the network capacity by adding more layers or increasing the channel-length with lots of training data, the diffusion models surely have the performance gain. Honestly, I cannot catch the authors' intension from this propositions.\n\n# Q-2. Ablation study\n\nWhat if the authors intentionally omits the latent space encoding? I mean instead of using 2D-3D autoencoders, what happens if the network only consists of the 3D autoencoders? How much gain could we obtain if we adopt the latent space encoding?\n\n# Q-3. Clear difference between the previous works.\n\nCan the authors create one table to clearly demonstrate the difference?

If so, how much is lost/kept?\n\nWhile GSSL improves the results on OOD, it seems it can worse the results on ID. Can the authors provide more insights on this?\n\nConsidering one utility of the model is for generating new drugs, model interpretability could be important. In the latent space, would it be possible for the authors to provide some visualization on the learned features and if available, colored by some topological and geometric features of the graph? If there are certain patterns there then it may be useful to help better understand what features are mostly kept in the latent space and enhance the interpretability of the model."

                "value": "This paper investigates the appropriate latent space for generating 3D graphs. The authors derive several conclusions through theoretical analysis:\n\n- The lower the dimensionality of the latent space, the higher the performance limit of diffusion.\n\n- Higher quality of the latent space (i.e., lower reconstruction error) corresponds to a higher performance limit of diffusion.\n\n- Preserving symmetry (maintaining graph properties after translation, rotation, etc.) is an inductive bias of the latent space, contributing to an increased performance limit of diffusion.\n\nGuided by these theoretical insights, the authors propose a method named \"latent 3D graph diffusion.\" This approach utilizes cascaded 2D-3D graph autoencoders to learn a latent space with low-error reconstruction (learning topological graphs) and symmetry invariance (learning geometric graphs). Furthermore, the authors extend this method to conditional generation given SE(3) invariant properties (rotation-translation invariance) or equivariant 3D objects.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that appropriate regularization of the latent space through graph self-supervised learning can further enhance the robustness of conditional generation. The comprehensive experimental findings indicate that, compared to existing competitive methods, this approach can generate 3D molecular graphs with enhanced effectiveness/drug similarity and is at least an order of magnitude faster in diffusion training. The speed advantage increases with the size/complexity of molecules."
