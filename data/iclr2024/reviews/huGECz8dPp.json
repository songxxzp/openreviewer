The training process involves two phases: fitting and compression, with compression believed to enhance generalization. The paper introduces an approach for IB analysis in general DNNs, overcoming challenges in estimating mutual information between high-dimensional vectors. The method involves compressing representations to estimate mutual information accurately. The approach is supported by theory and demonstrated through experiments, including analysis of a real-scale convolutional DNN, uncovering new insights into mutual information dynamics."

The proposed method has considered some of existing entropy estimation methods, (which they all have their own limitations) to estimate MI using the empirical frequencies in the MI expression (equation 1). What is the novelty of this approach ? The entropy estimation is a canonical problem in statistics. Both parametric and non-parametric have their own pros and cons. While non-parametric methods (e.g., KDE) do not consider any underlying assumption about the distribution of the data, they are typically not scalable in very high-dimensional regime (and they need a lot more training data), and they might be less sensitive than their parametric counterparts when the assumptions of the parametric methods are met.\n\n2 - Another issues is the one that authors have also mentioned in the paper. Just providing a toy example of MNIST for a small classification model is not yet convincing to consider the scalability of the MI estimation approach, its accuracy on the high-dimensional data (not just 784), and its applicability in other non-classification problems (regression, unsupervised, generative, etc.).\n\n3 - Some details about the functions $f_1$, $f_2$, $f$, $g$, etc do not exist in the paper."

In other words, I question the validity of the first equality in (4). To be more concrete, I think one can create counterexamples where a KDE of MI differs depending on whether it is obtained from the original data (dimension $n$) or the latent representation (dimension Sn'$). Since MI can only be estimated and not measured, this leads me to questioning the validity of the study: If compression affects the results of the estimator, then how can we be sure that the estimate represents the \"true\" (i.e., uncompressed) behavior of MI?\n- Along that line, it would be important to see in Figs. 3 and 4 how the MI estimate obtained directly from the high-dimensional images behaves. This would more clearly show that compression is useful in comparison with estimators for high-dimensional data.\n\nSummarizing, the paper does not show that the compressed representations are \"better\" for MI estimation than the original layer outputs/data, or that fundamentally different qualitative results can be obtained. While the approach seems reasonable and valid, I would like to see more evidence that it outperforms MI estimation from high-dimensional random variables.\n\n\nMinor:\n- In (5) and below, it should be made clear that $E_X$ is the encoder for $X$, while $E_Y$ is the encoder for $Y$.\n- In the third paragraph of Section 5, the abbreviation WKL is not introduced.\n- The colormap in Fig. 5 is not ideal, there is too little variation in the color."

(Note that the MINE curves are blue.)\n- In the same figures, there is good agreement between the blue and green curves. However, it can be assumed that the encoders $E_X$ and $E_Y$ act in a way to retrieve $f_1(\\xi)$ and $g_1(\\eta)$, respectively (or some other bijection thereof). With this in mind, it is not surprising that the curves agree so well. Has this been tested? For example, it could be a good idea to use a higher/smaller dimension for the output of the encoders as for the dimension of the generated signals.\n- Why does the KL estimator have such a high offset?\n- In Section 6, is noise also added during training or only during computing MI estimates? In any case, since noise is added one must not ignore the potential geometric affects that are induced by it (effects both during training and during estimation).\n- How where the confidence intervals in Fig. 5 computed? How many networks have been trained?\n- In Fig. 6, why is there so much variation/so large CIs at the end of training?\n- In the same figure, why is there no decrease of \"loss delta\" at the end of training?\n- In the same figure, does \"loss delta\" refer to the difference of losses between two consecutive epochs?\n- In the same figure, the data processing inequality seems to be violated for $I(L;Y)$, see $L_2$ vs. $L_5$. Do you have an explanation for this?\n\n_EDIT:_ After discussion with the authors, I have improved my score."
