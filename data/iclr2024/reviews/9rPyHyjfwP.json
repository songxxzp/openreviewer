                "value": "This paper proposes a pre-trained molecular language model called MOLGEN to generate molecules from SELFIES with self-feedback. Specifically, MOLGEN contains two pre-training stages: 1) molecular language syntax learning using the BART model; and 2) domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning using two sets of tunable prefix vectors in multi-head attention layers. Then, the authors use a self-feedback paradigm to align the pre-training language model with the anticipated chemical preferences in the downstream phase (i.e., the authors align the model\u2019s probabilistic rankings of diverse molecular responses with preference rankings observed in actual chemical contexts)."

                "value": "Weaknesses:\n- The experiment is incomplete. I suggest that the authors conduct more comprehensive experiments (i.e., baseline comparisons and ablation studies) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MOLGEN model. For example,\n    - $\\bf baseline~comparison$: most of the baseline models in the experiment are from before 2022 (e.g., JT-VAE (2018), GCPN (2018), GraphAF (2020), and GraphDF (2021)). I suggest the authors to compare more latest baselines to validate the MOLGEN.\n    - $\\bf ablation~study$: the authors only performed ablation study on the self-feedback mechanism. In Eq. 8, the authors used the \"soft\" label to smooth the one-hot distribution (Eq. 2) into the target distribution. This is one of the contributions of the paper. The effectiveness of the \"soft\" label also needs to be verified in the ablation study. Also, the hyper-parameter \"$\\alpha$\" controls the balance of the two losses and has an important impact on the performance of the model. How to choose a and the effect of different $\\alpha$ on the model performance should also be demonstrated in the experiments.\n\n- The description of the model (Section 2) is not clear. More details need to be presented. For example,\n    - Does the \"$l$\" in the paragraph above Eq. (1) indicate the total number of SELFIES in the dataset? Is it the same as the \"$l$\" in \"two sets of \"$l$\" tunable prefix vectors\" above  Eq. (3)?\n    - What do the two tunable prefix vectors refer to, and why are these two vectors used in multi-head? How to prove that the performance is improved after using them?"

In addition, both \"MOLGEN\" and \"MolGen\" appear in the context, which should be consistent.\n    - The masking and start tokens are denoted by \"[MASK]\" and \"[S]\" in the context, but are \"[Mask]\" and \"[s]\" in Figure 3.

                "value": "The submission contains significant issues, including the misuse of two major concepts and some questionable claims. Given the centrality of these concepts to the paper's overall argument, I recommend that the paper is not suitable for publication in its current form.\n\n* **Concept Misuse: Molecular Hallucination:** The authors introduce the notion of \"molecular hallucination\" as the generation of molecules that do not exhibt the desired properties or follow human preferences. The term appears to be a misnomer, as it does not align with the traditional understanding of \"hallucination\" in the NLP domain. In NLP literature, hallucination generally refers to the generation of fictitious or nonexistent entities or events [1,2,3]. Conversely, the authors assert that their \"hallucinated\" molecules are chemically valid, meaning they are neither fictitious nor nonexistent. Therefore, the use of the term \"hallucination\" could be misleading and should be reconsidered for clarity and conceptual consistency.\n* The related works on hallucination are missing.\n* **Concept Misuse: Self-feedback:** The authors refer to their fine-tuning approach as the \"self-feedback paradigm.\" However, the proposed method is more like \"**external-feedback**\", instead of \"self-feedback\". In short, the proposed fine-tuning method is to align the molecule generation probabilities to chemical property scores **that are measured by an external model**. Given this external dependency, the term \"external-feedback paradigm\" would be a more accurate and descriptive name for the fine-tuning method. \n* **Missing Ablation Study:** MolGen is pretrained in two phases. In the second phase, MolGen is adapted on two datasets using a method called domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning. After reading the submission, it remain unclear to me how the second phase can help other downstream tasks. Moreover, the ablation study on the second pretraining phase is missing. It is also unclear how is the proposed prefix tuning method compared against other parameter efficient tuning methods, like LoRA?\n* **Unclear Figures:** \n  * What are the x-axis of the two subfigures on the right of Figure 7? \n  * What are the x-axis and y-axis of the two subfigures on the right of Figure 8?\n  * What are the x-axis of the Appendix Figure 2?\n\n* **Novelty:** This is not the first molecule language model pretrained using molecule's SELFIE representations. [4] is also pretrained using SELFIES. The relevance and diffierence to [4] should be discussed.\n* **Dubious claims:**\n  * In the second paragraph of introduction, the authors argue that previous works `are limited by their heavy reliance on task-specific tuning`. However, the proposed method also relies on a fine-tuning stage for downstream tasks.\n  * In the third paragraph of introduction, the authors claims that `almost all previous studies have focused primarily on synthetic molecules, neglecting natural products`. However, the literature review to support this claim is missing.\n  * The opening paragraph of Section 2.2 describes a scenario where a molecule has one substructure that is effective for a specific task but is counteracted by another, ineffective substructure. However, it remains unclear how the proposed method addresses this issue.\n  * In the second paragraph of the introduction, the authors claim that `the brittleness of SMILES may lead to a high proportion of generated chemically invalid strings`. Are there any citation to support this claim? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Reference:**\n\n[1] On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization.

A crucial feature of the model is the self-feedback mechanism, which safeguards against \"molecular hallucinations\" by ensuring that the model's estimated probabilities align with real-world chemical propensities. Comprehensive evaluation on established benchmarks highlights MOLGEN's superior performance in properties like penalized logP, QED, and molecular docking. Further analysis confirms its adeptness in accurately capturing molecule distributions, discerning intricate structural patterns, and efficiently exploring the chemical space."

Instead, only a comparison was made between Chemformer and MolGen. Technically, a SELFIES-based MolecularLM implemented on BART does not seem irreplaceable. Given that many works involving molecule generation are still based on SMILES (such as MoMu, MolT5), the effectiveness of SELFIES in the work lacks further experimental verification.\n\n2. The significance of the 'domain-agnostic molecular prefix tuning' step is questionable. It seems to be merely a measure to avoid overfitting in the overall model. Whether synthetic molecule generation and natural product generation in drug discovery can be considered two different tasks, and whether other dataset partitioning methods would have similar effects, are not explained. Therefore, the comparison of molecular distribution learning in the paper lacks persuasiveness."

More persuasive experiments addressing a broader range of molecular properties could significantly enhance the applicability and robustness of the proposed model.\n\n3. The correspondence between the attention scores and the specific molecular structures in Figure 8 and Appendix Figure 5 is not very intuitive. The current figures do not convincingly demonstrate that the SMILES-based PLM is focusing attention on less relevant positions. It would be beneficial if the authors could revise this figure to improve its clarity and interpretability, thereby aiding readers in better understanding the model's inner workings."
