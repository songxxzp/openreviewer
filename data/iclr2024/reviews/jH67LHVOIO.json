This paper also introduces a new collection of datasets for assessing calibration of LLMs in phrase-, sentence-, and paragraph-level. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a series of baselines by using four metrics. Other key findings include: (i) Larger models within the same family exhibit better calibration. (ii) GPT-family models show superior calibration compared to LLaMA, Llama-2 and Vicuna models despite having much fewer parameters. (iii) Fine-tuning pretrained model (e.g., LLaMA) with samples of focused purpose (e.g., conversations) may lead to worse calibration, highlighting the importance of fine-tuning setups."

                "value": "* Presentation-wise, parts of the paper have coherence issues because it is convoluted with two different ideas that are not properly tied up together. The paper starts to be read as having Litcab as the major contribution and curating the CaT benchmark, a minor contribution, to evaluate Litcab. However, the final page (Section 6.6 and Table 3) is dedicated to using CaT to benchmark how well-calibrated the LLMs are. Litcab is not used in this section, which makes it somewhat irrelevant to answering the main hypothesis of the paper.\n\n* The CaT benchmark has two major shortcomings. Firstly, the motivation for creating CaT is to be able to evaluate calibration for long-form responses. However, CaT consists of five datasets with short-form responses and only one with long-form responses. There are a couple of datasets that could have been included, such as ELI5, WebGPT, ASQA, and QAMPARI (which is not passage-level but contains multiple claims). Secondly, it is important for a proposed benchmark to have both proposed (a) baselines and (b) evaluation metrics. However, the proposed baselines could not be evaluated in all cases (specifically passage-level) using their metrics. This makes it difficult to assess the calibration capability of Litcab at the passage level.\n\n* I think it would help the paper if there were extrinsic evaluations to support Litcab's usage in a real-world task setup. Self-consistency is now commonly used because the original paper showed promising results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. How would the use of Litcab fare on those datasets?\n\n* The paper mentions that Litcab has the \"advantage of requiring a reduced number of data samples for training, leading to enhanced computational and data efficiency\". There is no evidence shown in the paper that supports this statement."

LITCAB aims to improve the alignment between the model confidence and the output correctness and reduce the issue of hallucination in LLMs. The authors construct CAT, a calibration evaluation benchmark consisting of six open-ended question answering (QA) tasks that cover answers ranging from phrases to paragraphs. The authors propose a four-step procedure to assess the calibration and correctness of paragraph-level generations, which involves extracting individual claims, mapping them to spans, estimating their confidence and verifying their accuracy using GPT-4 and Wikipedia passages. The authors conduct experiments on LITCAB and several baselines using Llama2-7B and other popular open-source LLMs. They find that LITCAB consistently improves the calibration performance across all tasks, and that larger models within the same family tend to exhibit better calibration. They also observe that fine-tuning may lead to worse calibration in some cases."
