Some of the paragraphs are not related or unnecessary, please see the questions below. More importantly, the use of Gaussian Blur is not well introduced or explained, it seems an arbitrary solution jumping into the draft. The only reason discussed in Section 3.3 is to preserve the semantic information instead of removing it. However, this is exactly opposite to those previous perturbation used for fidelity measure. If the semantic content is always needed, how can we measure the CAM? or we do we still need to perturb? This draft seems missed the purpose of the perturbation, so the whole story is less solid. Besides the general idea, I highly doubted if Gaussian blur can retain the semantic information when the std is high enough. The two \"proposed\" metrics are very similar to previous solutions but using the Gaussian perturbation, thus the metrics cannot be considered as new proposals. To sum up, this draft requires more improvement at this moment."

However, Fig.1 only shows the tiny difference in the CAM visualization, and this showcase seems not connected to the main story. Is it better to show the behaviour of those metrics when perturbing with different strategies? \n\n2.The definition of the hierarchy in Table is not clear, could be removed.\n3. Page 3, third paragraph, \"the reason for such unreliability.. lies at model level\", this claim is questionable, and I cannot find any explanation for this claim.\n4. The same paragraph, \"introduce two new metrics,....at model level 1\", this is confusing without any explanation, the proposed metrics are also based on the change of confidence scores or pixel rankings, why they are at different levels than the previously proposed? Again, I suggest introducing the idea without relying on the confusing hierarchy could be more clear.\n5. The extensive related work is not really necessary, the most related work seems (Tomsett 2020) and those fidelity metrics. However, they are not properly presented regarding the key problem, why different perturbation may lead to different results.\n6. Section 2.1, first paragraph is confusing to me. It seems the whole paragraph is repeating how those metrics works, without introducing what the limitation is and why it is a limitation.\n7. Section 2.2 Contribution 1: \"to justify the unreliability\"?? Again, the draft didnot show clearly what the unreliability is, and why does it need to be justified??\n8. Section 2.2 Contribution 2: \"Unlike...\", The proposed methods are very similar to the previously used for fidelity measure, this claim is unclear to me.\n9. Section 2.2, Contribution 3: ablation studies on different models and data are not considered as contributions.\n10. Section 3.1 \"Let R0 be the ranks of pixel\", this sentence is wrong and inconsistent with the story after, it is not a list of ranks, it is a list of ranked pixels.\n11. Section 3.1, the presented \"framework\" is not necessary, this is the common assumption behind most of the fidelity measure.\n12. Eq(6), why is the rank invariant to the std value applied? \n13. what is the meaning of the brackets in Eq 7?\n14. For both metric, why are they both approaching 1 ideally? how can we know which saliency map is better? Strong gaussian blur will damage the semantic content, why we are still expecting 1?\n\nTiny problems:\nThe use of acronym is inconsistent."

The article mentioned many times that we should investigate the reasons behind the inconsistency, but we didn't see the relevant analytical statements and experimental analysis in the article, and only gave Figure 1, but Figure 1 can only show that there is no difference between models and it is not directly related to the disturbance emphasized in this paper.\n3. The experiment is not reasonable enough. In this paper, a total of 26,267 photos before and after the disturbance are directly tested together, which does not reasonably distinguish the experimental comparison before and after the disturbance, and can not clearly see the inconsistency of metirc after the disturbance.\n4.
