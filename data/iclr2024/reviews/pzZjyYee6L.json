The related work section claims that none of the existing trajectory works uses the bicycle kinematic model, which is not true. There are many existing trajectory prediction models (such as MultiPath++ [1] and DKM [2]) that explicitly predict future accelerations and steering angles and roll out future trajectories using the bicycle kinematic model.\n\n[1] Varadarajan et al. 2022. Multipath++: Efficient information fusion and trajectory aggregation for behavior prediction.\n\n[2] Cui et al. 2019. Deep Kinematic Models for Kinematically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Predictions.\n\n* This paper talks about the advantages of using the bicycle kinematic model as the prior for trajectory prediction. However, none of the three proposed formulations used the actual bicycle kinematic model. From the result in Table 1, Formulation 1 has the best performance, and Formulation 1 is simply to predict deltas between waypoints.\n\n* The evaluation result lacks some important information. The tables only show the relative improvement from the MTR baseline. However, it is not clear whether the MTR numbers are from the MTR paper, the WOD leaderboard, or from the authors' own implementation. I highly recommend the authors submit their solution to the WOD leaderboard and report the numbers from the leaderboard.\n\n\n--- Other minor comments\n\n* Please add equation numbers.\n\n* I am not sure sigma_{x + vx * dt} = sigma_x + sigma_{vx} * dt is correct. The summation of two Gaussian variables x + y should be sigma_{x + y} = \\sqrt{sigma_x ^ 2 + sigma_y ^ 2}.\n\n* Reference Chai et al., 2020a and Chai et al., 2020b are the same paper."

For some examples of works which use some variant of bicycle, unicycle or other kinematic model for trajectory forecasting in the context of self driving:\n\n* Imagining The Road Ahead: Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction via Differentiable Simulation\n* Deep Kinematic Models for Kinematically Feasible Vehicle Trajectory Predictions\n* A Kinematic Model for Trajectory Prediction in General Highway Scenarios\n* MixSim: A Hierarchical Framework for Mixed Reality Traffic Simulation\n* Guided Conditional Diffusion for Controllable Traffic Simulation\n\nAs these are papers that simply come top of mind / found after a brief literature review, I may have missed more and thus I encourage the authors to add this list after performing a more thorough literature review. For the rebuttal I'd like to see the authors more clearly position their work in the context of existing literature.\n\n\n**2) Experiments**\nThe paper was unclear about the baseline performance. Specifically, did the authors compare to the original MTR, or a re-implemented and retrained version of MTR? I found the following statements in the paper:\n> We implement kinematic priors on state-of-the-art method Motion Transformer (MTR) Shi et al. (2022), which serves as our baseline method.\n\n> ... we downscale the model from its original size of 65 million\nparameters to 2 million parameters and reproduce baseline results in our experiments\n\n> We compare our model against the state-of-the-art architecture...\n\nIn all tables in both the main paper and the appendix, the results are written as relative to the baseline, and I could not find absolute numbers for the baseline anywhere. Thus I am lead to believe that the results are for the smaller model, which likely performs worse than the original MTR? If this is true, I believe the authors need to release the absolute performance of their baseline.\nThe reason that the absolute performance is important to me is that its unclear whether the gains of the kinematic model hold when absolute performance increases as you scale the model, etc."

As such, the main contribution of the work, as stated by the authors, lacks novelty.\nPlease find detailed comments below:\n- \"but also scales well in size\", unclear if this is a good or a bad thing. The authors should clarify this better.\n- The authors need to cite the earlier work listed above, and put their work into context. This is the biggest issue with the current manuscript and makes the work not ready for publication until this is done (since the level of contributions of the work is questionable).\n- Figures 1 and 2 are not referenced in the text.\n- Notation can be improved. E.g., in the equation for L  in Section 4.1 the notation p_h is not introduced before being used. The authors should make sure that all notation is properly defined.\n- \"we downscale the model\", how exactly? Unclear.\n- The authors do not properly explain the experiments, such as the number of mixture components used and other information relevant to understanding the approach and the experiments.\n- For the experiments with noisy trajectories, do you add noise during training as well? Unclear, would be good to clarify.\n- The experiments are somewhat dry, would be good to add some visual results as well."
