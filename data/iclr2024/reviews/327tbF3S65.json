Authors also consider using various hypergenerators to capture different data scales and modalities in that work.\n- I do not think the paper also compares with \"Implicit Diffusion Models for Continuous Super-Resolution\" (CVPR 2023), in terms of tools and results obtained. Comparisons with this paper are important too.\n- Using a generative latent diffusion model directly follows the idea of Rombach et al. (CVPR 2022).\n- Hierarchies of multi-scale PE have already been developed in the literature. The paper \"Composite Slice Transformer: An Efficient Transformer with Composition of Multi-Scale Multi-Range Attentions\" (ICLR 2023) is a good reference. \n\nWhile combining existing ideas into a robust model is not a demerit of the paper per se, the paper's contributions are limited. \n\nAlso, when explaining the interpolation and the basis functions, more details are needed since these concepts are hard to understand the way they are written."

Can the difference in 3D shape representation cause unfair comparisons?\n\n2. **How to project sparse point clouds to be processed by a 2D CNN?** It is mentioned in Appendix A that an orthographic projection is performed on the PointNet local pooling features to three canonical 2D planes, and a shared 2D CNN encoder is used to obtain tri-plane latent features. However, the output of a PointNet encoder with a local pooling operation is still a sparse \"point cloud\" in the shape of `BxNxD`, and the adjoined arrays in the tensor are not actually adjoined spatially. How does a 2D CNN perform on the sparse input?\n\n3. **Will the code be publicly available?** Releasing the code is not mentioned in the paper, but it would be helpful to facilitate future related research and provide much more details about the method."

I see this work as a natural extension to other works on domain-agnostic LDMs for INRs such as Functa (Dupont et. al, 2022a) and DPF (Zhuang et. al, 2023). The only difference between DDMI and Functa is replacing dynamic MLP weights with dynamic positional embeddings. \n2. DDMI made three changes w.r.t. Functa -- dynamic MLP weights -> dynamic PEs, HDBFs, and CFC. It is still unclear how much improvement was achieved by making a shift from dynamic MLP to dynamic PEs. The ablation only covers the relative effects of HDFCs and CFC.\n3. Scalability -- The work claims that the prior works are not scalable as dynamically modifying MLP weights limit its expressive power. However, DDMI has not demonstrated any scalability. Most of the results are either on single or few class dataset, while the number of samples are in the order of 10K. Currently, it seems to me that semantic class specific INR generative model is being fit. True scalability to larger community is model's ability to generate high quality samples from diverse set of classes. Consider training on Objaverse scale of dataset.\n4. Significance -- Given that almost all high-fidelity LDM models are obtained by domain-specific LDMs, I fail to understand the real value behind creating domain-agnostic architecture. It make sense to anyone, if priors from multiple domains are reused which is possible only if DDMI was trained by sampling input discrete data across domains.\n5. Domain Agnostic ? It is not clear how the presented DDMI is domain-agnostic. I presume the input and output of LDMs will remain the same when trained for signals from each domain. However, the implementation details in appendix suggests that dataset-specific architecture was deployed with LDM input/output also changing likewise."
