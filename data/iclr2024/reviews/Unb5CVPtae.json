                "value": "This paper introduces a pioneering approach, Time-LLM, which harnesses the reprogramming and Prompt-as-Prefix techniques to repurpose large language models for time series forecasting while keeping the backbone LLM intact. The method innovatively bridges input time series to optimized text prototypes, making the time series inputs more digestible for language models. This integration enables large language models to seamlessly tackle time series forecasting. Furthermore, Time-LLM incorporates the Prompt-as-Prefix mechanism to facilitate the LLM's reasoning capabilities over time series. By adding natural language prompts, the approach enriches time series input and presents task directives in a comprehensible language format. In my view, this holds substantial promise for controlled time series analysis across diverse applications. The authors have conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed reprogramming framework, showing considerable potential in leveraging LLMs for time series tasks."

It offers an in-depth exploration of the proposed concepts related to LLM reprogramming and Prompt-as-Prefix.\n\n2.\tThe proposed reprogramming framework is novel and has proven to be highly effective. Instead of directly feeding original time series into LLMs, the innovative approach of converting time series into text prototype representations for language model comprehension stands out. This strategy might set the foundation for a broader method of cross-modality adaptation in LLMs.\n\n3.\tThe augmentation of input context with declarative prompts, such as domain expertise and task guidelines, to steer LLM reasoning is notably promising. It offers significant potential for controlled time series analysis in a variety of applications.\n\n4.\tThe architectural design of Time-LLM is logical and underpinned by clear motivations. Dividing time series into patches and reprogramming each into text prototype representations is a wise choice, which aligns well with the use of natural language prompts to guide LLM in time series reasoning.\n\n5.\tComprehensive experimental results are provided to evaluate the proposed reprogramming framework from various aspects. Indeed, Time-LLM demonstrates promising results, especially under the few-shot and zero-shot protocols, showing considerable sample efficiency and applicability in real-word applications. There are also abundant ablation and other side experiments to study the proposed method from various aspects."

In doing so, this work shows how using not only trained LLMs but also the learned embeddings can transfer to time series problems.\n\nBy building the final embeddings from word embeddings, the authors cast the time-series problem into a \"language\" problem. This allows the authors to further utilize language model features by employing a prompt which is shown to improve time series predictions. One could imagine expanding further on this new property by trying different prompts and seeing if such prompts can illicit adversarial results. Ultimately, this approach may be utilized for new experiments to both probe LLMs and further exploit their capabilities."

These methods are important and very performant in practice, (2) N-BEATS and N-HITS were only compared during short-horizon forecasting, (3) Recent papers on using LLMs for time-series forecasting were not compared against, for e.g. LLM4TS [1] and PromptCast [2] (4) I am aware that the paper \"LLMs are zero-shot forecasters\" [3] only got recently published, but it would improve the experiments if the authors were able to compare with it. I should emphasize that this is completely optional. \n2. **Datasets:** Increasing the amount of datasets for experimentation will improve the results. The current set of datasets is pretty limited, even for long horizon forecasting datasets, where datasets such as Influenza-like Illnesses, Exchange Rate, Tourism, and Weather etc. (see PatchTST) were missing.

                "value": "My main concerns include: \n- While LLM is a hot topic in the deep learning community, it is still unconvincing to directly transfer the knowledge of natural language in LLMs to time series tasks. Note that i) text and time series are distinct data modalities, and ii) the pre-trained LLMs are not pre-trained with text-time-series pairs. \n- Furthermore, the first contribution *\u201cintroducing a novel concept of reprogramming large language models for time series forecasting without altering the pre-trained backbone model\u201c* is not new, as previous works such as GPT4TS [1] have also explored this reprogramming approach, regardless of which parts of the LLMs are fine-tuned. Additionally, the proposed method requires training the input and output layers for adaptation, which means that it does involve some alteration of the pre-trained backbone model.\n- While using text to aid in time series prediction can be beneficial, as seen in applications such as stock prediction using financial news text mining, it's unclear how the shared declarative for a whole time series dataset can help understand complex temporal behaviors in different windows. Although these prompts may provide domain expert knowledge and task instructions, they do not introduce text information at each time step. Therefore, it remains unclear how these text prompts can benefit the understanding of complex temporal behaviors in time series.\n- Compared to related work such as [1], which has applied pre-trained LLMs to various time series tasks, the experiments in this paper are relatively limited. For instance, only prediction tasks are considered, and even for long-term prediction tasks, only the ETT datasets are included. This narrow scope of experiments limits the evaluation of the proposed approach to other time series tasks and datasets.\n- The link for the source code provided in the paper is empty. I cannot check for more details regarding the experiments.\n\nReference:\n[1] One Fits All: Power General Time Series Analysis by Pretrained LM"

            "questions": {
                "value": "More discussions:\n- Can you discuss the connections and differences between LLMs and traditional/existing deep-learning time series models? \n- It would be helpful to define what is a good time series representation expected to be and to provide a more in-depth discussion of why pre-trained LLMs are capable of producing such representations.\n- Regarding cross-domain adaptation in the zero-shot setup, I'm curious about what knowledge from the source domain in time series can be transferred to the target domain to achieve zero-shot prediction."
