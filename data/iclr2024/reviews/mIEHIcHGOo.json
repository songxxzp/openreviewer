                "value": "Large Language Models (LLMs) inherently encapsulate a vast reservoir of knowledge within their parameters, acquired through pre-training on extensive textual data. The authors investigate the possibility of transferring parametric knowledge across Large Language Models (LLMs) of different sizes. They introduce a novel approach, examining knowledge transfer from a unique parametric angle. Employing a two-stage framework involving knowledge extraction and injection, they conduct thorough experiments on four varied benchmarks, confirming the natural transferability of model parameters. Additionally, through detailed analysis of the pivotal factors impacting parametric knowledge transfer, they provide valuable insights for future research in this field."

Filling this gap is crucial in understanding the broader applicability and potential democratization of cutting-edge machine learning capabilities.\n\nThe paper introduces a novel parametric knowledge transfer paradigm. It moves beyond traditional methods like online and offline distillation and presents a unique approach focused on selecting specific static parameters from teacher models and injecting them into student models.\n\nThe experiments are conducted across various benchmark categories and LLM sizes. The results consistently demonstrate improvements in student performance after transferring teacher model parameters, providing strong empirical support for the proposed method.\n\nThe paper provides in-depth analysis of crucial factors such as teacher scales, initialization strategies, number of seed samples, and the nature of extracted parameters. This enriches the understanding of parametric knowledge transfer and its underlying dynamics.\n\nThe paper is clear and concise in writing."

It would be interesting to see a wider range of model sizes being compared or comparing models pre-trained on different corpora (e.g. LLaMA-1/2 cross-transfer, or something like GPT-J). \n\nS3 - There is a solid discussion of different factors that may affect parametric knowledge transfer here (layer selection, parameter location [ffn/self-attention], structure in transferred parameters, and number of seed samples)"
