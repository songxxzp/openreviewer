In the context of this paper, given that the backbone of the model is always kept frozen and no finetuning is necessary, one could argue that, if the pretraining is done on the same dataset (Tab E.1), the final model will still contain forget samples encoded in its weights. This of course is a matter of current research, however it also limits the applicability of the proposed method. \n\n- I wonder if this method would be similar to taking a pretrained model (without DKVB) and then just either *i)* retraining the classification layer without the forget class or *ii)* masking out the forget class from the output logits. In both cases, I would find it difficult to call it \"unlearning\" but rather \"obfuscation\" of some kind, although I am not an expert in this field.\n\n- Unlearning an entire class seems perhaps unrealistic in practice; whereas unlearning specific instances should be more relevant. \n\n- I think that the experimental evaluation is a bit lacking and could be expanded to larger datasets such as ImageNet, as the proposed method is almost compute-free"

The original work also shows improvements on CIFAR10/100, the same benchmarks in this paper. \n3. DKVB improves class-incremental learning since each class can be learned by disjoint key-value pairs, thus the model updates for learning new classes can be localized to certain parameters. Thus, why DKVB would help with unlearning might be quite trivial \u2013 simply deleting the key-value pairs corresponding with a certain class. \n\nThere are also a couple improvements that could be made to improve the quality of the paper.\n\n1. The paper focuses on performance evaluation, but there\u2019s a lack of empirical analysis of their conceptual motivation. For example, how often are key-value pairs shared between classes? Is it close to 0? Can this be visualized? \n2. A more diverse range of benchmarks is necessary to test the unlearning capabilities of DKVB. It\u2019s unclear how successful the unlearning method is because the evaluation benchmarks are quite similar to each other (CIFAR10/100, LACUNA100). It might be interesting to evaluate the method on more diverse benchmarks such as benchmarks with outlier classes that are quite similar to each other, or training to distinguish between superclasses and unlearning a specific class in a superclass."

Nonetheless, the practical integration of these ideas to address real-world challenges is acknowledged as valuable and can sometimes be sufficient to make significant contributions to the field. (Minor points)\n\n- **Comparative Analysis**: The paper could benefit from a broader comparison with existing work, particularly the zero-shot unlearning approach presented in [2]. Additionally, for the specific examples of unlearning demonstrated in Figure 3, it would be advantageous to include a wider range of baselines, as referenced in [3-6], to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.\n\n- **Unlearning Scenarios**: The focus on 'complete unlearning' may limit the paper's scope, given the broader spectrum of unlearning scenarios presented in [2-7], where the goal is for the unlearned model to closely resemble a model that has been retrained without the forgotten data. Although the authors claim in Appendix D that their method is applicable to traditional machine unlearning problems, detailed results and discussions within these contexts would strengthen the paper's contributions.\n\n- **Efficiency Metrics**: For claims regarding efficiency, the absence of reported running times is a noticeable omission. Including such metrics would substantiate the claims of the method's efficiency and offer a tangible comparison with other techniques.\n\n- **Model Diversity**: The exclusive use of the ViT model in the experiments may raise questions about the method's generalizability. As DKVB [1] also considers ResNet architectures, a discussion on the application or limitation of the proposed method to other architectures would provide deeper insights into its adaptability and utility across various models.\n\n- **Limited Literature Review**: Given the recent surge in research surrounding machine unlearning, the paper's literature review could be perceived as insufficiently comprehensive.
