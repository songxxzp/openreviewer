The current paper presents a new approach for choosing which parameters to reset that is data-dependent, and show that it outperforms several baseline methods. Additionally, the authors provide additional useful analysis, such as the consistency in parameter selection across iterations, comparisons with other importance estimation techniques, and robustness-related evaluations."

This is because the number of datasets used is small (e.g. the authors evaluate ResNet18 on only four small datasets). Since the datasets are small and there are tens of vision-related datasets available, I'm curious to know why the authors used only four datasets. I don't think including more datasets should be an issue since (again) they are small and ResNet18 is also small. The same applies to the other sections. For example, the authors evaluate robustness to adversarial attacks in one dataset only!\n\n- The authors only compare with old reinitialization baselines (KE, DSD, and BAN). There have been more recent layerwise methods, but the authors only compare against those in the appendix (see Table 5). There, the improvement is marginal. Is there a reason the authors chose to not include those other methods in the main paper? Also, why aren't they included in the ResNet50 evaluation? They are also not discussed in the Related Works section, and there are a few recent related works missing as well; e.g. (Sheheryar, et al. 2023) and (Jaehoon, et al. 2022). They should all be discussed in the related works section.\n\n- The reported results for CIFAR10-C seem too low to me. I would expect ResNet18 trained on CIFAR10 to have an accuracy larger than 60% when evaluated on CIFAR10-C. \n\n- The authors argue in the appendix that transfer learning is not useful for medical applications. But that's not true. Many SotA models are pretrained on datasets, like ImageNet. See for example: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0842-3.\n\n- There are a few places containing typos, incomplete sentences, or undefined symbols:\n   * Page 2: \"Finally, Our work ... \" --> \"Finally, our work ...\"\n   * Equation 4: $\\pi$ is undefined. \n   * Page 4: \"Due to the difficulty in deciding ...\" is not a complete sentence.\n   * Page 4: \"retained learned\" should be either \"retained\" or \"learned\"."

I suggest the authors either improve this presentation or remove entirely the class imbalance experiments (or correct the figure and text description if they do not mean overall accuracy). In its current form the results are not supporting the conclusions. \n- The adversarial perturbation experiments are also lacking in presentation. Is the figure a single run or multiple runs?

With the posterior knowledge of the results of SKE this statement is supported, but the hypothesis which sparked the investigation cannot be based on the results. \n- How is the size of subset used to evaluate connection sensitivity selected? Is there any estimate for what is sufficient?\n- Sensitivity analysis is not part of this paper but how do the authors interpret the sparsity constraint k? Is there anything in the literature or insight they have as to how sensitive the model is to it? \n\nOther comments:\n- There are instances where the word \"significant\" is used to describe the difference between two methods. I highly recommend that the authors save this term to describe statistical significance (it seems a significance test was not performed). There are better words to describe a great difference that are not as ambiguous. \n- It should be made much clearer that section 3.1 is standard KE and not the version being presented in the paper. On first reading it seems like it is the method being introduced and the fixed mask creates confusion. \n- When the binary mask is defined in 3.1, make it clear it is binary when it is first mentioned, not in a later paragraph.\n- Grammatical error: \"We define a deep neural network f with L layers and is characterized by\"\n- The acronym DNN is defined multiple times. The authors should define it once at the start and then only use it and not spell it out or redefine it multiple times.\n- Figure 4 is never referenced in the main text"
