                "value": "- Analysis about \"Is subspace modeling useful\" in Section 4.4. The conclusion is obtained based on the comparisons between SuPr w/o reg, CoOp, and CoOp-Ensemble. It is not clear what are the detailed differences among the three methods, which is essential to understand whether the comparisons can lead to the conclusions, as the performance gain may come from other components.\n\n- SVD for subspace modeling. It is a bit hard for me to understand the role of SVD in subspace modeling. According to Sec. 3.2, it seems that SVD is to guarantee that the matrix $U_c$ is an orthonormal matrix. If so, is it possible to only restrict $U_c$ to be orthonormal without the SVD operation? Also, it is interesting to know the ablation where $U_c$ is no longer an orthonormal matrix. In this potential ablation study, can we say the subspace are no longer disentangled/independent?\n\n- Main technical contribution. It seems that the main messages of this work are (1) dividing soft prompts into subgroups, (2) regularizing soft prompts with hard prompts. There lack insights why the subgroup manner works beyond the technical tricks.\n\n- Analysis on subspace. Does the subspace have any semantic information, or what does each subspace represent? That would contribute to explainability."
