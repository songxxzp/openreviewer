                "value": "This paper presents a novel approach for leveraging machine learning in multi-agent path planning (MAPF) based on large neighbor search (LNS). Given an initial solution for a MAPF problem instance, LNS selects a subset of agents and optimizes their solution paths, treating the paths of other agents as spatiotemporal obstacles. \n\nTraditionally, subset selection has relied on heuristic rules or linear models with hand-crafted features. However, the method proposed here integrates a deep neural network into the agent subset selection process. This network predicts the performance gain achievable by selecting a particular subset, using a tensor that encapsulates the agents' current paths, potential shortest paths, and the layout of other obstacles. To manage the computational expense of applying this procedure to various subsets, the proposed method initially extracts features from all agents' paths and predicts the final gain from the feature map slices corresponding to the subset, facilitated by the deep network.\n\nThe method's effectiveness has been validated on MAPF problems involving hundreds of agents."

The proposed method appears solid and technically sound. The authors have implemented numerous techniques to reduce computational costs, a critical factor in MAPF where execution time is crucial.\n\n**Significance**: The method's significance has been evaluated across multiple MAPF problems, and it has been tested on scenarios involving hundreds of agents.

Given this trade-off between computation time and solution quality, how can the benefits of the proposed method be demonstrated?\n\nAdditionally, it is unclear what computational resources the proposed method and baseline methods require. The paper suggests that both the proposed method and Linear baseline were tested on a GPU, but it doesn't specify the details of GPU specs required. In practical scenarios, not all environments have access to high-end GPUs, and being able to execute path planning on affordable entry-level GPUs or standard CPUs could be a significant advantage."

Moreover, I wonder if the proposed method may require much more GPU resources than other methods and could be much slower when performed on CPUs.\n\nFor example, is it possible to reduce the model capacity for the proposed method so that it can run as approximately fast as the Linear baseline, and compare the solution quality under such conditions?"

Starting with a feasible (but suboptimal) solution, LNS can solve MAPF in an anytime manner by iteratively destroying and repairing parts, i.e., the neighborhood, of the incumbent solution to improve the solution quality over time. The neighborhoods are determined by using some heuristics from the literature. Given a set of neighborhood candidates, the paper proposes to use deep learning to select a suitable neighborhood via score prediction. The deep learning approach exploits the spatio-temporal structure of the MAPF problem by encoding the paths and obstacles in separate tensors, which are processed by a series of 3D and 2D convolutional layers as well as an attention mechanism. The approach performs well compared to state-of-the-art approaches in selected problems and displays some generalization capabilities for maps of the same size."

                "value": "**Novelty**\n\nThe main contribution of the paper is the application of standard deep learning techniques to 2D grid world MAPF. Since tensor encoding of grid worlds is common practice [1,2,3], I do not consider the approach as particularly novel. The architecture is common practice as well (standard convolutional layers and attention), where the application to a new domain seems to be the main contribution to me.\n\n[1] D. Silver et al., \"Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search\", Nature 2016\n\n[2] J. Leibo et al., \"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Sequential Social Dilemmas\", AAMAS 2017\n\n[3] M. Dennis et al., \"Emergent Complexity and Zero-shot Transfer via Unsupervised Environment Design\", NeurIPS 2020\n\n**Soundness**\n\nAs noted in the paper, MAPF-LNS relies on fast operations (like prioritized planning/PP for repairing and linear models for neighborhood scoring) to ensure its success as an anytime algorithm. However, the paper proposes several modifications to the standard/default setting of the MAPF-LNS or MAPF-ML-LNS paper, which actually increase runtime:\n- A relatively large model for score prediction compared to simple linear models\n- Generation of several neighborhoods at each iteration (which requires the invocation of the destroy heuristics several times)\n- Priority-based planning (PBS) for repairing, which is slower than the default PP due to backtracking in the tree search\n\nMAPF-LNS and MAPF-ML-LNS rely on a large number of iterations to achieve a good solution quality. Therefore, I am not sure if the addition of several more expensive operations actually pays off since it should significantly limit the number of possible iterations.\n\nThe generalization depends on the map size. A model trained on $32 \\times 32$ maps cannot be straightforwardly used on, e.g., $24 \\times 64$ maps and is therefore limited.\n\n**Significance**\n\nThe paper evaluates with different hyperparameters than suggested in the original literature [4,5]. Thus, I am\n1. uncertain about the fairness of the evaluation and\n2. skeptical about the effectiveness, since some changes increase runtime that would limit the number of iterations for sufficient search (see above).\n\nI am also not sure if the modifications used in the deep learning variant are also applied to the linear version. If so, the comparison might be unfair since MAPF-ML-LNS uses some mechanisms, e.g., random neighborhood sizes, that are seemingly important for its success. \n\nThe experiments only report relative numbers, which makes it difficult to relate to the performance reported in prior work, e.g., do the baselines still perform similarly? In that case, fairness could be confirmed, at least.\n\nThe evaluation only considers maps with a fixed number of agents; therefore, I have no intuition on how the average/final gap would scale, e.g., with an increasing number of agents.\n\n[4] J. Li et al., \"Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search\", IJCAI 2021\n\n[5] T. Huang et al., \"Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding via Machine Learning-Guided Large Neighborhood Search\", AAAI 2022\n\n**Evaluation**\n\nTo decide whether I raise my score or not, I first need to check the following:\n- Since MAPF algorithms are generally very implementation-dependent (as stated in the appendix), I need to confirm the validity of the proposed mechanisms by viewing and running the code myself (with a provided trained model).\n- I need to see plots or tables with the absolute performance, i.e., the sum of delays, for different numbers of agents per map. The evaluation can be easily done by running the experiments with the neural LNS on the exact same setting as [5] and comparing it with the performance of MAPF-LNS and MAPF-ML-LNS reported in that paper.\n- I need to see plots or tables with the number of iterations and success rate per iteration for different time budgets. If the approach was valid, we should see a lower iteration count than the state-of-the-art but a higher success rate."
