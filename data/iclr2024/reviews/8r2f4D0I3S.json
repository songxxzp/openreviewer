            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "**1. Multi-Objective Optimization with Many Objectives**\n\nThe proposed method formulates the TTA as a multi-objective optimization problem with a large number of objectives (B as the batch size), which is also called a many-objective optimization problem. It is well-known that the Pareto set/front (e.g., the set contains all Pareto solutions) is a $(B-1)$-dimensional manifold in non-trivial case, and a vast majority of solutions will be non-dominated (e.g., all be Pareto optimal) with each other when B is large. In other words, it could be hard to find a single gradient direction to improve all B objectives at the same time.       \n\nCan the proposed method always find a valid gradient direction via MGDA, especially for a large B and TTA in the wild (e.g., the objectives are quite different and conflicted)?\n\n**2. Computational Overhead**\n\nThe proposed method needs to solve two constrained optimization problems (eq 7 and eq 10) with B variables at each step to find a valid gradient direction, which could lead to a long runtime, especially when B is large. A practical grouping method has been developed to reduce the huge computational load. However, the obtained gradient direction is not guaranteed to be valid for all objectives and might lead to worse performance.  \n\n- **Grouping and Runtime:** According to the ablation study in Appendix A.3, for CIFAR100-C with batch size 200, the proposed method with group size 5-50 requires a 4s-10s runtime for each batch. Does it mean the total runtime should be 1,000s - 2,500s for handling 50k images? According to [3], the current TTA methods (e.g., Tent [1], EATA [2], and SAR [3]) only need around 100s for processing 50k images for ImageNet-C, which could be even faster for CIFAR100-C. It seems that the proposed method needs at least 10x to 25x computational load than other TTAs. If it is true, with group size 5, the proposed method has similar performance with Tent while requiring 10x run time. Please correct me if I misunderstood something here.\n\n- **Runtime Comparison:** What is the group size of the proposed method used for CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C in the main paper? Please report the runtime for each TTA algorithm for all main experiments. If the proposed method requires a significantly larger runtime, it is also interesting to see the performance of Tent/EATA/SAR with a similar computational budget (e.g., multiple runs of gradient updates for each batch).\n\n**3. MGDA for $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe motivation of MGDA for eq (7) is intuitive, but it is not for eq (10). What is the benefit of finding the same $\\epsilon$ via MGDA for all losses in eq (10)? Why not find separate $\\epsilon$s for each individual loss via standard SAM?    \n\n**4. Novelty and Related Work**\n\nThe multi-objective optimization formulation of TTA and SAM proposed in this work is novel based on my understanding. However, the statement \"(this work is) the first proposal of merging two concepts of flat-minima and Pareto optimality\" is a bit overclaimed. For example, the work [4] also discusses the combination of Pareto optimality and flat-minima from a different perspective (e.g., mode connectivity). In addition, the multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality have also been investigated for domain adaption [5] and out-of-distribution generalization [6], which could be (not directly) related to this work.\n\nOnce the TTA problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, the proposed method is a straightforward application of MGDA on top of the standard TTA methods (e.g., Tent/EATA/SAR), where the SAM approach is directly from SAR[3].\n\n**5. TTA Problems Other than Classification**\n\nWill the high computational overhead make it very hard for the proposed method to tackle TTA problems other than classification, such as those with dense predictions (e.g., segmentation in Tent[1])?"
