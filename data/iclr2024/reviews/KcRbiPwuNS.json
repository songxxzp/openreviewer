It addresses the issue of traditional GNNs being unable to distinguish between some graphs due to their message-passing structures. The authors tackle this challenge by proposing a novel learnable Lanczos algorithm with linear constraints, LLwLC. Specifically, the authors extend the Lanczos algorithm and project the approximated eigenvectors with a Neumann constraint matrix to efficiently encodes the relation between nodes. The experimental results demonstrate the effcitiveness of the proposed algorithem in link prediction tasks."

This is well-known in numerical linear algebra and Lanczos is very rarely used without some form of restart precisely for this reason.\n\n-) In Figure 2, purple box: you mention \"svd(T)\" but it is clear you mean \"eig(T)\".\n\n-) The statement about the orthogonal projector is wrong. C(C^TC)^{-1} holds for the case of independent rows in C; instead, in your case you have linearly independent columns thus it should be  (C^TC)^{-1}C^T. You can verify then that P=I-C(C^TC)^{-1}C^T is what you want, and not P=I-CC(C^TC)^{-1} which the math indicate in your paper (the multiplication CC is not even defined).\n\n-) The discussion in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 are basically straightforward and read as textbook-style material. I would remove both.\n\n-) The results indicate superior performance for LLwLC but no timings are shown. In other words, higher accuracy should not be accompanied by high costs. Indeed, the authors do a lot more work per Lanczos step via LSQR -- this is essentially applying Lanczos \nwith shift-and-invert.\n\n-) The keyword 'Neumann' keeps appearing only to be explained on page 7."
