Although the authors describe the proposed additive factor as simple yet effective, this work can still be considered progressive research. However, when compared to [18] and [19], it is unclear whether significant progress has been made for this conference.\n\n3. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments that involve fewer state-of-the-art methods."

It is suggested to include more benchmark methods in the experiments to avoid categorizing it as an enhanced/improved version of SpeCL method, and instead position it as a robust SSL method.\n\n3. The factor $\u03c4$ effectively relaxes the orthogonal constraint on negative pairs. It would be interesting to explore the integration of other methods, such as Barlow Twin, in different ways.\n\n4. In the experiments, it is recommended to analyze the results achieved with different values of $\\tau$ due to its previous detailed analysis. This analysis can provide insights into what can be inferred from the results obtained with different $\\tau$ values."
