                "value": "The paper presents an unsupervised domain adaptive approach for the lane detection task by utilizing a teacher-student framework and contrastive learning paradigm. Firstly, the method utilizes a positive sample memory module to retain domain-related lane features. Next, unlike existing methods, the authors propose cross-domain contrastive learning to improve feature discrimination. Additionally, a domain-level feature aggregation method is introduced to combine domain-level features with pixel-level features. The proposed unsupervised domain adaptive algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the TuLane, MuLane, and MoLane datasets."

It lacks experimentation on datasets such as CuLane and OpenLane, which limits the generalizability and thoroughness of the findings.\n3.

While the article focuses on unsupervised domain-adaptive lane detection, it makes me confused whether its proposed issues, i.e., ineffectively learning discriminative features and transferring knowledge across domains could be applied to all unsupervised domain-adaptive segmentation tasks. It prompts consideration of whether the issues discussed are universal or specific to this particular domain. Additionally, the introduction of contrastive loss and feature aggregation, while useful, may not fully justify the article's contribution, as these methods are well-established in domain-adaptation field.\n2.\tThe quality of writing and diagrams in the paper requires improvement. Several definitions provided in the article lack clarity, hindering reader comprehension. For instance, in section 3.2, the term 'anchor' is introduced without a precise definition. Additionally, the role of modules is not adequately explained, such as how the introduction of PSMM ensures the appropriate assignment of positive samples. Furthermore, the figures lack detail and refinement, and the overall layout, as seen in Figure 2, does not appear to be carefully designed.\n3.\tSome conclusions of the article are exaggerated. For example, in section 4.3, the authors claim that their method performs significantly better than other methods when using ERFNet as the detection model, but choosing PyCDA (Accuracy/%: 86.73) and MLDA(Accuracy/%: 88.43) to compare instead of SGPCS with the accuracy of 89.28%."

Author only conduct experiment on TuLane, MuLane, and MoLane, three simulated lane datasets proposed from one single work, the result would be more convincing if authors could conduct domain transfer experiments between Tusimple and Culane, which are more commonly used dataset for the community. \n3.
