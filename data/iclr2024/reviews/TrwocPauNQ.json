They model this as an offline MDP setting and tackle the three main challenges unique to RLHF (which is similar to offline RL): (1) The agent must infer human behavior policies from the offline data. (ii) The agent must tackle a dynamic environment and estimate a reward function from behavior policies. (iii) Finally tackle the challenge of insufficient dataset coverage and large state space. To do this they propose a dynamic choice pessimistic policy optimization algorithm. This is a value iteration-based algorithm that incorporates a penalty term (pessimism) that ensures learning in an offline setting (standard for offline RL setting). Thy study three settings and establish sub-optimality bounds for them. These are the settings for the general model class, linear model class and RKHS model class and all of them suffer from an additional $e^H$ term. This is a theory RL paper and they do not conduct any experiments."

Why is this required and where doe this show up?\n2) Another concern is the missing discussion on technical novelty. This paper does not discuss where does their proof differs from Jin et al (say) for the linear MDP setting. Can you elaborate on this? Similar papers on theoretical RL has extensive discussion on their main proof. (see Uehara orr Jin et al.)\n3) Another concern is the extra factor of $e^H$ in the bound. Where and how do they show up? Is it really necessary or is it possible to get rid of them?\n4) A detailed discussion on the main difference between RLHF an offline MDP settings is missing. Your proofs seem to leverage many of their techniques. Can you elaborate on the main similarities/differences of the proof technique briefly? This will help me put te paper in context.\n5) Finally please discuss your idea on the lower bound (at least for the linear MDP setting which is well understood). This will help us understand if the $e^H$ factor is really necessary."

To address this challenge, the authors introduce the DCPPO algorithm. To elaborate, the authors start by making assumptions about the agent's policy based on certain characteristics and then proceed to recover the concealed reward function through human feedback. Once the reward is estimated, the DCPPO algorithm incorporates it into a standard RL framework to discover a policy that is close to optimal. Ultimately, the authors provide a theoretical guarantee regarding the sub-optimality of the resulting policy."

This study lacks novelty as the algorithm is essentially a straightforward integration of a reward learning framework with a standard reinforcement learning algorithm, offering little in terms of groundbreaking innovation.\n\n2.The assumption regarding the agent's policy in equation (1) is overly restrictive. Specifically, it mandates that every agent has access to the value function $Q_h^{\\pi}$, which may be unattainable if the agent lacks prior knowledge of the transition probability function $P_h$. If the transition probability function $P_h$ is already known, Algorithm 2 becomes redundant, and it suffices to focus solely on estimating the reward as in Algorithm 1.\n\n3. The estimation error discussed in equation (9) may encounter issues stemming from data dependency. To elucidate, the estimated reward is constructed in Algorithm 1 and relies on the offline dataset. However, in Algorithm 2 (Line 2), the agent performs ridge regression using the same dataset. Due to this data dependency, it is possible that $E[\\tilde V (s_{h+1})]\\ne P_h \\tilde V (s_h,a_h)$. A similar issue has been addressed in the work by Jin et al. (2019) through the application of uniform convergence techniques. Unfortunately, in this study, the estimation reward function lacks a linear structure, and the corresponding value function class may not have a small covering number. Consequently, even with the use of uniform convergence techniques, the problem may not be resolved.\n\n[1] Provably Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation"

For the first case, the settings seem similar to generalized Max entropy Inverse RL works (which is addressed in the next point). Secondly, the paper gives an example of the dynamic rewards for RLHF, where rewards are obtained at intermediate steps as well. However, I am not sure why this is referred to as `dynamic nature of MDP transition` because this is similar to MDP settings, assuming state $s_t = x_{1:t}$ based on which the probability of the next token will be affected. This can be handled with standard offline algorithms, and therefore I am not clear on the motivation behind DCPPO.\n\n**Similarity to Max Ent Inverse RL**: As mentioned above, this work seems similar to Max Ent Inverse RL works. The paper mentioned in the appendix that this work is a generalization of such previous works, however, I am still not convinced that MaxEnt IRL method would not be applicable to the mentioned setting because of the above reason. Additionally, there has been some work to generalize MaxEnt IRL works [1, 2]. Given this, I am not sure why Dynamic Discrete Choice might be necessary for RLHF settings and if they are practical.\n\n**Empirical results**: The paper does not provide any empirical analysis of DCPPO compared to other online/offline algorithms. Even a simple comparison would have clarified the importance of DCPPO in such settings and would also help with the above issues."
