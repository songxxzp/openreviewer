This paper adopts the  \"point-to-mask-to-rbox\" manner. Compared with rbox with orientation information,  mask has fine-grained pose information. The approach  designs to generate the relatively coarse rbox based on the selected masks, which may put the cart before the horse.  The proposed method can solve the high-quality mask selection based on point prompt  for general mask generator like SAM for aerial image filed, which is applicable.\n(3)This method follows the assumption that the annotated point of an object is close proximity to the center of the mask.  This assumption  is also not rigorous enough.\n2. The proposed Symmetry Axis Estimation (SAE) module is not general for all categories, which is effective for PL and HC for DOTA dataset.

                "value": "In my opinion, the most controversial point of the article is the use of SAM.\n- As we all know, SAM is a fully supervised visual model, and its training data over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper does not seem to be the so-called weakly supervised oriented object detection, more like zero shot object detection. This is extremely unfair to compare with other truly weakly supervised algorithms.\n- The authors used the mask generated by SAM to generate the rotated bounding box, which seems to be redundant and unnecessary. In my opinion, if a higher quality mask can be produced, there is no need to study other rough object representations, i.e. horizontalrotated/poly bounding box. Therefore, I'm more curious the performance comparison of instance segmentation models trained by masks before and after refinement on commonly used segmentation data sets (i.e. COCO, LVIS). Relevant experiments are given in SAM.\n- As mentioned earlier, the issue of masks generated by SAM found by the authors is interesting, but the proposed solution seems to be engineered and customized. The large number of hyperparameters and thresholds/scores makes me question the generality of the proposed method, and the authors only used one dataset (i.e. DOTA) for verification in the paper, which is not credible.\n- The title is too exaggerated (i.e. single point is all you need). According to the author's experimental results, even if a powerful SAM is used, the performance is still far behind the fully supervised algorithm, e.g. RetinaNet vs. P2RBox (RetinaNet): 67.83% vs. 55.50% (-12.33%).\n- Based on the above analysis, I think the name of the method is more suitable to be called SAM2RBox.\n\nIn general, the method proposed (i.e. SAM based) in the paper does not completely match the topic (i.e. weakly supervised object detection) it is trying to solve, resulting in an unsatisfactory discussion. Moreover, the customized method design and insufficient experiments make me think that this article is not suitable for publication yet, and I temporarily reject it."

                "value": "- The article lacks details on how point annotations are generated.\n- The authors need to rethink the story of the proposed method, i.e this is not a simple weakly supervised detection method. It seems more appropriate to call it zero shot or a combination of the two?\n- The writing of the article needs to be better improved, especially the organization of formula symbols.\n- Experiments on more dataset are needed, especially the ablation experiments of hyperparameters. It is better to use datasets from different scenarios and not just remote sensing datasets.\n- Appropriate failure cases need to be discussed to analyze why the current performance is still far below the performance of fully supervised algorithms.\n- For Figure 3, I would rather recommend a visual comparison of other similar methods, e.g. P2RBox-H2RBox and SAM (xxx) in Table 1.\n- Please place the table or figure at the top of each page."

                "value": "Oriented object detection excels in identifying objects of any orientation, while point annotation provides a cost-effective method but lacks size and orientation data. The study introduces the P2RBox network that uses point annotations and a mask generator to produce mask proposals, which are then refined and transformed into rotated box annotations for training advanced detectors. With the integration of the Oriented R-CNN, the P2RBox achieves notable performance, marking the first attempt to train an oriented object detector using point supervision."
