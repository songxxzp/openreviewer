                "value": "This paper proposes a novel model for implementing the SE(3)-equivariance in robotic pick and place problems. Given a task involving placing an object relative to another object, the method first uses an equivariant network to calculate the desired distance between points on the two objects. The core innovation of the method is that given the desired distances from a point on object A to a set of points on object B, one can use multilateration to locate the desired location of this point relative to object B. Repeating this process for multiple points on object A, the relative pose between A and B could then be confirmed. The proposed method is evaluated against a number of baselines, where it demonstrates commendable performance, especially when the task requires high precision."

                "value": "1. The idea of using multilateration to calculate the relative pose is a compelling aspect of this paper. It transforms the equivariant problem of calculating the desired relative pose into an invariant problem of calculating the desired relative distance, which could be useful to reduce the complexity of a model.\n2. The paper is well-written with intuitive examples to illustrate the idea."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "My main concern with the paper is that the experimental evaluation is not strong enough. In the main paper, the experiments are mainly conducted in the Mug Hanging domain. In the two other domains in Table 3 in the appendix, the proposed method\u2019s performance is worse than the baselines. Though the authors discuss that the underperformance compared with TAX-Pose could be due to the lack of the implementation of the symmetry-breaking technique, the proposed method also lags behind NDF. Additionally, the performance of DON and NDF under 1cm and 3cm distance thresholds is not reported in either Table 1 or Table 3."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. As is mentioned in Weakness, my main comment is about the experiment section. The paper would be much stronger if there is an environment that actually requires high place precision (e.g., gear/kit assembly) rather than merely adjusting the precision requirement in the mug-hang task. Moreover, incorporating the performance of NDF under the 1cm and 3cm precision requirements in Tables 1 and 3 would likely strengthen the paper as well.\n2. Does the proposed method have a faster runtime compared with the baselines? Does the proposed method have a higher sample efficiency? Since the idea of using multilateration reduces the equivariant problem into an invariant problem, I am curious about if there are benefits from this angle."

The methodology looks pretty promising (equivariant + differentiable optimization process) and generic, as a submission to a ML conference, one would expect to see a more diverse evaluation of the approach.\n\nOther weaknesses identified pertain to limitations in handling symmetric objects or multimodal placement tasks, as acknowledged by the authors. This could restrict the system's application in scenarios where multiple correct poses exist. Additionally, the requirement for segmented task-relevant objects can be a significant limitation in unstructured environments. The paper could be improved by exploring these aspects further, possibly by integrating generative models or unsupervised segmentation methods.\n\nHowever, overall, I would still think the paper is slightly above the threshold, while a more complete evaluation could well strengthen the paper."
