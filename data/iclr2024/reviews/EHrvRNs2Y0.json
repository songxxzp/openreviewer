                "value": "The paper proposes a method for improving the performance of coordinate-based network representation of various temporally varying signals. The key contribution of the method is that rather than having the network learn to represent temporal variation in a completely unstructured way, the temporal variation is instead modeled by a low-rank weight matrix which is added to a base weight matrix that is shared across all time instances. This exploits the temporal consistency in the underlying signals being represented, and results in a more parameter efficient and high-quality representation of the underlying signal. This is benchmarked across various tasks in which coordinate-based networks are used, such as video overfitting, dynamic SDF fitting, and dynamic neural radiance field fitting, where ResFields (the contribution) demonstrate consistent increased performance."

The paper is described exceptionally clearly, and the method makes intuitive sense on why it would improve performance for representation on temporal signals. The relative simplicity of the method and lack of reliance on a number of complex hyperparameters makes it more likely that future methods will be influenced and use the contributions.\n2. The evaluations are thorough, across three different temporal signal representation tasks, all demonstrating clear improvements from the ResField contribution. In each of these domains, a number of baseline methods are all compared against. I found that the comparisons on dynamic NeRF especially are thorough, using many different state-of-the-art methods and all showing that ResFields leads to increased performance.\n3. The method is ablated well, and various ablations show the contribution of the method is actual source of the improvements."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "In my opinion, the main weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. To me, it is unclear how much capacity the low-rank representation has to model various dynamic components. While this may not be a problem in something like dynamic NeRF or dynamic SDF where the signal remains relatively constant over time, for overfitting a 2D video, where there may be cuts or completely different scenes, I would be interested to see how the method performs. In this case, it seems like the low-rank weight matrix approximation would be required to model all of the signal, as there is little consistency shared in the underlying signal over time and thus less information to store in the shared weights. Could this potentially be a limitation of the method?\n2. One additional minor weakness is that the method seems like it may add significant amount of computational overhead. For every iteration, the weight matrix of the underlying representation needs to be changed. Does this result in significant slowdown in optimization? It would be an insightful comparison to include this in the baseline comparisons, especially in the dynamic NeRF scenario where speed of fitting is very important. If this adds a significant amount of computational overhead, it is possible that the amount of gains is not worth it, and could be achieved by simply training a standard representation for longer."

                "value": "I do not have any additional questions on the manuscript. Overall, as described in the strengths section, I see the paper as a good paper: the method is described well, simple, and makes intuitive sense, and then it is evaluated well across a number of tasks and ablated to show that the improvement comes from the proposed contribution. For this reason I am positive on the paper and leaning towards acceptance. I see some minor weaknesses in the potential capacity of the model, and especially in the potential computational overhead of the method in training speed. Addressing these weaknesses would incline me to raise my scores for the paper.\n\n**Update after author response**\n\nThank you for the detailed response. It has addressed my questions. I have updated my score in accordance."

For example, can we make v(t) to be N_ixR_i and M_i to be R_ixM_i? Is there any intuitive reason why this is not a good choice? Maybe this is addressed in the ablation study in Section 4.4, but providing some more intuition is good.\n- (minor) While the idea seems to support any matrix-like weight parameterization, the specific factorization might provide different interpretation depending on the way the network use the weight matrix. Maybe the specific design choice is limited to MLP architecture.\n- Concern about long sequence. The sequence weight at time t is modeled as W_o + \\Delta W_t. When t is very far from the original frame, then the weights \\Delta W_t can have significant weights, so it\u2019s not clear to me whether sharing the same matrix M across all time steps is a good idea.

A method for temporal information modeling is proposed, which by employing a low-rank representation, controls the amount of parameters to be learned. This approach enables temporal modeling without affecting the network size. Alongside, this paper innovates by integrating temporal residual layers in neural fields, dubbed ResFields, showcasing an effective way to represent complex temporal signals without increasing the size of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), thus offering a promising solution to the capacity bottleneck for modeling and reconstructing spatiotemporal signals."
