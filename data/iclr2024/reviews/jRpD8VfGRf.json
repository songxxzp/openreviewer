The method in Section 4.2.3 is confusing. It is not reasonable for modal-specific interest representation and R to maximize mutual information, because S_X in R is modal shared. The authors later additionally minimize mutual information modal specific interest representation and S_X. This raises the question of why to maximize in the first place.\n3. There are a lot of notation errors, and I guess in section 4.2.3 the author wanted to use E_X to mean the same thing as G_X. There is also a SZ in Section 4.2.2 that appears without explanation. These errors greatly affect the normal understanding of the method proposed by the authors.\n4.

The method aims to address different issues in multimodal recommendation, namely: 1) the existence of noisy information in multimodal content adopted for recommendation; 2) users\u2019 decision may be driven by separate interest factors underlying each modality; 3) the assumption that each multimodal feature should be represented in the same semantic latent space may be wrong. After introducing and formalizing the multi-interest disentangled representation, the authors propose four additional components to the usual recommendation loss function (i.e., binary cross-entropy for the task of click prediction). The loss components account for: 1) modal-sharing interest representation, 2) modal-specific interest representation, 3) interest distribution representation and 4) multi-interest contrast learning. Extensive experimental settings when testing the model\u2019s performance against eleven state-of-the-art (multimodal) recommender systems on three recommendation datasets show the efficacy of the MIDR solution. Moreover, an ablation study, complemented by a hyper-parameter values analysis, further motivate the architectural choices for MIDR."

For instance, equation 1 introduces several terms and notions which have not been properly detailed in the preliminaries.\n- From a general overview of the paper, it becomes hard to find the real novelty of the proposed approach, as it encompasses several winning approaches from the recent literature.\n- The performance improvement with respect to the tested baselines seem a bit incremental. The authors may try to run statistical significance tests of MIDR performance with respect to the baselines.\n- No code of the proposed MIDR approach is released at review time, which makes it difficult to further assess its efficacy and reproducibility.\n\n---\n### After the rebuttal\n\nDear Authors,\n\nthank you for your rebuttal, which I carefully read.\n\nIndeed, the ablation study shows the efficacy of each introduced module in terms of **recommendation performance**. However, even after considering your rebuttal, I still cannot see the **technical** novelty provided by the overall MIDR approach, which still appears to me as a combination of various winning approaches from the recent literature. \n\nIn this respect, I believe the methodology section from the paper is not helpful to clarify these aspects. As already outlined in my review, it is very hard to follow the formalism and methodology due to the numerous missing conceptual details in section 4, which are sometimes taken for granted.\n\nMoreover, I am still convinced the performance improvement with respect to the other baselines is not quite evident, and it might require further statistical tests. Indeed, the sharing of code at review time would have been useful to test the effectiveness of the approach from an implementation point of view.\n\nIn light of above, I would keep the initial rating I gave to the paper. In my opinion, If all such aspects were addressed, the paper could be ready for submission to other venues. I strongly encourage the authors move towards this direction."
