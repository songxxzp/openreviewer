For example, the authors do not show a selectivity curve for the neurons studied, but only the decoder performance results in the form of tables of numbers. The impact of the paper could be improved if the authors presented in a synthetic way the principle of encoding the direction of the head in the VIP area, as well as the different results as improved by their methods. Finally, one of the interesting results of this paper is to show that different decoding architectures give different performances. This result could shed light on the inherent complexity of the neural representation underlying the distributed representation of head orientation in the population of neurons studied, but I lack this analysis."

Please clarify.\n\nMinor:\n- The syntax of the paper did not allow me to fully follow the arguments. I have not taken this into account in my evaluation, but the authors should use a service, even an automatic one, that allows clarification of certain points. \n- The LaTeX formatting of the paper could be improved. In particular, quotations in the text should be enclosed in parentheses, e.g. using ``citep''. Text appearing in equations (\"real\", \"data\", ...) should be formatted as text, e.g. using `\\text'."

Given the limited biological data for VIP neuronal responses, the paper presents a novel approach using spiking neural networks (SNNs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create synthetic neuronal response data. This synthetic data is then employed to improve the decoding of heading directions, with a focus on temporal and spatial dynamics. The proposed temporal spiking generative adversarial networks (T-SGAN) generate realistic synthetic data, enhancing the decoding accuracy of recurrent SNNs. The paper demonstrates that this framework leverages the benefits of biological plausibility and low energy consumption of SNNs in neuronal response decoding."
