Also, as the paper proposes a new pruning mehtod, the related work part need also discuess peer methods; 3) for experiment part, the authors are required to compare peer pruning methods as the main technical approach presented in this paper is a pruning technique.

It doesn't seem to me like group theory is used to arrive at the proposed feature merging/pruning algorithm.  Permutation of pairs of neurons in a network by swapping their input and output weights (provided they are connected to the same inputs and outputs) is sort of obvious, and in that light, the merging of the features/neurons is quite simple and straight forward.  Defining categories, functors and objects in this setting doesn't seem to give us any extra insight, or produce different tools for how to do the merging.  I find that the theoretical part of the paper has very little to do with the proposed practical aspect, other than perhaps we can name things using group theory terminology.  And if anything, it seems to obfuscate a very straight forward pruning technique that is proposed.  \n\nIn this race to the state of the art accuracy (which I still think we are all in) it seems that any pruning technique that sacrifices even a fraction of accuracy for some gains in computational/training time costs, is not going to be of practical use.\n\nI can't tell if the proposed feature complexity is meaningful in any way.

And what is actually feature complexity?  Is it the total count of neurons in a network after pruning?  How do we know it means something?    \n\nThe statement \"feature complexity corresponds to the most compact representation of a neural network\" sound like something related to the minimum description length (MDL) or minimum message length (MML) principles.

This idea, along with the technical part including theory, approach and empirical results, to my best knowledge, are basically new in literature. Specifically, the authors develop a quantitative metric to enable the reduction of neural network parameters based on the proposed concept of feature equivalence. In fact, the layer-wise feature complexity is also well supported by a number of empirical studies which also well align with the intuition: e.g. higher feature complexity with the same size of networks can achieve better performance; a larger network tends to learn redundant feaures; equivalents features may correspond to certain low-level semantics. It also well establishes the connection to linear mode connectivity (LMC).\n\nOne other interesting aspect of the paper is introducing the powerful tool of category theory to establish the (clear) theoretical foundation of the work: represent the network structure as a category and a certain neural network as a functor that maps this structure to specific parameters. The authors also give a clear discussion to differentiate their work for using the category theory. This perspective along with its technical derivation and results are new to my best knowledge and well fit with the proposed paradigm for understanding the feteature complexity."
