In the analysis of interaction efficiency,  two aspects - interaction sensitivity and interaction expressiveness - are discussed. Finally, a new GNN model, called Universal Interaction Graph Convolution (UIGC), is presented. The authors claim that this proposed GNN model has superior interaction efficiency."

How does this relate to interaction patterns, e.g., the five synthetic interaction patterns in Section 5.1? Also, how does this relate to node/pair symmetry? \n\n- For \"how a model can universally express any desired interaction within a given graph\", what does \"universally\" mean? The paper also mentions universal interaction but no formal definition is provided. \n\n- Interaction sensitivity is defined to measure the sensitivity of model outputs to perturbations in input node features. However,  perturbations in input node features are not the same as interactions between node pairs - so how are they related? Also, why is  interaction expressiveness considered as one aspect of interaction efficiency?\n\n(W2) The formulation and notations are not well presented.\n\n- Figure 1: What does \"a variable capable of taking K values (K=4 there)\" mean? How do you decide such a K value?\n\n- What does the notation $S_{i,j,:}$ refer to? What is $\\mathbb{R}^*$?\n\n- Equation 6 is not well defined. What do local structures mean precisely? Also the domain of $\\varphi^{LE}$ is vague - this needs to be formulated and clearly defined.\n\n- For the statement \"the discrimination ability of non-symmetry pairs of $\\varphi^{LE}$ is a partial order with the injectivity to be the most discriminative one\", it needs a clarification.\n\n- What is the definition of $S/\\sim$? Since $S\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, why is $S/\\sim=\\mathbb{R}^{\\eta}$?\n\n- In Proposition 1, is $f_{\\mathcal{W}b}$ a typo? What is $\\mathbf{x}_a$?\n\n(W3) Some explanations are needed to improve the clarity of the paper.\n\n- The paper mainly focuses on graph convolution networks as stated in Equation 1. But this is not clarified in the abstract and introduction which seem to consider graph neural networks in general.  \n\n- It is unclear how the issues under-reaching and over-squashing mentioned in the abstract and introduction can be addressed by the proposed UIGC layer defined in Equation 7.  \n\n- For the statement \"UIGC infers the interaction of each pair directly through their local encodings, which will not be affected by the connectivity of graphs\", I don't understand this. Why is it not affected by the connectivity of graphs?\n\n(W4) The setup of experiments may cause some confusions. For example,\n\n- How many graphs are randomly selected for the experiments on learning interactions on synthetic data, only one graph? How many graphs are considered in the result presented in Table 1?\n\n- For the experimental results on the five distinct interaction patterns shown in Figure 3, what are these interaction patterns? The current description in Section 5.1 is vague. Also, why are such interaction patterns selected? \n\n- The paper claims that the proposed UIGC can address the issues such as under-reaching and over-squashing of existing works. But there is no experiment provided to compare with existing works on how the proposed UIGC performs for solving such issues.\n\n- How is K selected? Why are only K=3 and K=8 considered?"

            "questions": {
                "value": "Q1. Seems Proposition 5 conflicts with the core idea of this paper. If I understand correctly, the core idea of this paper is \"to ensure all symmetric pairs, i.e., within the same pair partitions, learn the same interaction\" (from the bottom of Page 5). However, one of the assumptions of Proposition 5 says that $\\varphi$ is an injective function, which conflicts with the idea that \"symmetric\" but different node pairs can learn the same interaction.\n\nQ2.The core design of the proposed UIGC is the $\\varphi^{LE}$. However, it is not clearly mentioned what the specific $\\varphi^{LE}$ is used in this paper. Table 4 and Figure 4 only show the $\\varphi^{LE}$ of existing methods.\n\nQ3. The study on global interaction efficiency is not new. For example, this paper cites [1], which studies \u201ctotal resistance\u201d $R_{tot}$, a quantitative measure of global interaction efficiency. Thus, the authors should revise the statement of their first contribution. Furthermore, it does not seem necessary to distinguish \u201cglobal\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d interaction efficiency because what the authors mean by \u201cglobal\u201d is just a function (i.e., determinant, in Section 3.1) of the \u201clocal\u201d interaction efficiency matrix ($\\mathbf{J}_{\\theta,W}$ in Eq. (2)).\n\nQ4. Their UIGC might not be scalable because UIGC needs to compute graph automorphism, which seems to require at least $O(mn^2)$ time. A more efficient approach to addressing the long-distance interaction issue might be increasing the GNN depth together with techniques to alleviate oversquashing (e.g., [2,3] can train GNNs with 7~1000 layers.), or as simple as adding a supernode. Authors should compare with such methods in terms of both efficiency and performance in their experiments.\n\n**Two comments/suggestions:**\n\nC1. The applicable scope of graph automorphism might be limited. A classic result (see, e.g., theorem 2 in [4]) shows that almost all graphs do not have non-trivial automorphism, i.e., in almost all graphs, all but at most one pair of nodes are non-equivalent. In practice, only very special graphs like locally symmetric molecules have non-trivial automorphism. This limitation is also supported by their experiments because their UIGC has at most marginal gain on IMDB and RDT (social network datasets).\n\nC2. The discussion at the end of Section 4 looks vague. It might be more meaningful and more interesting if the authors can extend the discussions to rigorous theoretical analysis.\n\n[1] Black, Mitchell, Zhengchao Wan, Amir Nayyeri, and Yusu Wang. \"Understanding oversquashing in gnns through the lens of effective resistance.\" ICML 2023.\n\n[2] Li et al.
