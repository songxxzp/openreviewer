Each rule doesn\u2019t fully explain the outcome.\n\n- An analysis of the number of rules hasn\u2019t been conducted. The choice of the number of rules is critical in this approach and highly impacts the estimation performance. For example, when there are few rules, it might lead to an abundance of similar samples, resulting in overgeneralized treatment effect estimation rather than ITE that reflects the unique characteristics of the target sample. On the other hand, if there are many rules, it can provide more accurate ITE estimates, but it may be challenging to differentiate with a matching method.\n\n- The proposed method underperforms compared to ITE models. This suggests that the model may struggle to capture the unique features of data, possibly due to overgeneralization by similar samples. Additionally, is achieving 100% consistency an advantage of the model? This also indicates the model's overgeneralization.\n\n- How to deal with the violation of positivity assumption? The identified subgroup can include patients only from a single treatment group. \n\n- The computational efficiency of the proposed method is a concern. High-dimensional data requires significant computational resources, which is a notable drawback\n\n- Some details of experiments are missing. For example, what are in-sample and out-of-sample?"
