For this purpose, the authors propose to first apply a causal discovery algorithm, resulting in a maximally partially directed graph (MPDAG). Then, the authors add the predictor as an additional node to the causal graph and use identifiability theory for MPDAGs to estimate discrepancies with respect to interventional fairness, which is then added as a penalty to the predictor loss. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world data."

From my understanding, the novelty is combining these ideas with causal discovery and identifiability theory for MPDAGs.\n- Related to the previous point, the paper seems to combine these results in a rather straightforward manner, with limited novel ideas. However, the corresponding theoretical results (e.g., Theorem 4.1) seem sound and no previous work seems to have applied MPDAG identifiability theory to interventional fairness (which, in my opinion, is enough novelty for recommending acceptance, but also justifies why I am hesitant to give a higher score).\n- Applicability in practice: The proposed method seems to be difficult to employ in practice. First, one has to run a causal discovery algorithm to obtain an MPDAG, and then perform conditional density estimation to obtain the fairness penalty. Furthermore, there is no way of automatically choosing the trade-off parameter (even though this point is not specifically a drawback of the method in this paper).\n-  The authors hint at the possibility of extending their approach to other fairness notions. I think the paper would benefit from a more detailed review of related fairness notions in the appendix (e.g., total/direct/indirect effects, path-specific effects, counterfactual fairness), and how the method could (or could not) be extended"

They approach this issue by assuming the causal model is provided in the form of a maximal partial directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). This graph represents a Markov equivalent class of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that align with the available knowledge. Using the MPDAG, the authors' algorithm aims to construct a predictor that not only maximizes prediction accuracy but also adheres to interventional fairness, a causal-based definition of fairness. Unlike existing learning algorithms that ensure interventional fairness but fail to manage the accuracy-fairness trade-off, the proposed algorithm introduces a parameter specifically for this purpose. The authors employ key techniques to identify and estimate the intervention distribution of the predicted outcome. This allows them to evaluate the degree of interventional fairness and incorporate it into the optimization problem of the learning algorithm. Experiments using both synthetic and real datasets confirm the algorithm's capability to control the accuracy-fairness trade-off effectively."

Incorporating the techniques from Perkovic 2020 into causal fair learning is interesting. As highlighted by the authors, this approach achieves the identification and estimation of the intervention distribution for the predicted label, thus enhancing the control over the accuracy-fairness trade-off.\n\n4.

This raises questions about the method's novelity.\n\n2. The approach necessitates the creation and estimation of the generative model for non-admissible attributes.

Most existing measures of causal fairness constraints require prior knowledge of the directed causal graphs that encode the underlying causal relationships between variables. This paper attempts to relax this assumption. Some previous work, such as Fair proposed by Zuo et al., can achieve causal fairness but discards a lot of covariate information, which impairs the prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a method called IFair to trade-off unfairness and prediction performance by solving a constrained optimization problem. Meanwhile, the paper discusses in detail how to identify some causal estimators with theoretical guarantees and provides concrete examples to illustrate the propositions. The effectiveness of this approach has been confirmed in tests on both simulated and real datasets."
