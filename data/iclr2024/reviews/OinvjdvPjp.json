This design not only minimizes token usage but also significantly reduces vocabulary footprint while preserving the input's value. This simplicity is an attractive feature, emphasizing efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n    \n2.  The proposed method exhibits outstanding performance, particularly in synthetic datasets used to evaluate multi-digit multiplication and multi-operand binary tree combining. The results indicate that it excels at preserving real number information, outperforming previous approaches in these scenarios.\n    \n3.  The paper is meticulously organized, presenting the idea in a coherent and transparent manner. It guides the reader through the experimental process, offering a step-by-step validation of the proposed method and effectively highlighting the distinctions from various baseline techniques.\n    \n4.  One notable advantage of this approach is its adaptability to out-of-distribution inputs. This robustness is inherent in the generation of embeddings, allowing the method to handle cases where certain real numbers are more frequently predicted due to their prevalence or distribution discrepancies between training and testing datasets."

An issue with the rendering quality on page 2, affecting some figures, diminishes the readability of both the text and data points. The compromised legibility of axis labels and data points could potentially hinder the reader's comprehension and impact the overall impression of the paper.\n    \n2.  The paper's discussion of implicit normalization and its impact on real number embedding output is not sufficiently clear. The authors fail to provide a lucid explanation of how layer normalization influences the output of real number embeddings and why the normalization into a specific range is performed during preprocessing. Moreover, it remains unclear how these aspects might affect the performance of baseline methods. A more comprehensive and intuitive explanation is required to enhance the paper's accessibility.\n    \n3.  The experiments conducted in the paper exclusively utilize structured data in JSON format, focusing on scenarios like multi-digit multiplication and multi-operand calculations. While these experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in these specific contexts, they do not adequately showcase the method's capability to understand real numbers in the broader context of natural language. This limitation may raise questions about the universal applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Expanding the scope of experiments to encompass real-world language contexts would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its capabilities."

How is the capability of the proposed numerical encoding scheme affected by extremely small or extremely large numbers? Is it able to maintain representation accuracy and robustness in the presence of such numerical extremes?\n    \n3.  Can you provide an example of a use case where the proposed method demonstrates improved real number understanding capabilities, but the input data is not structured as in JSON, a binary tree, or multi-digit multiplication? This would help illustrate the method's applicability in contexts beyond structured data scenarios."

Is $h(\\texttt{[NUM]})$ layer normalized at the end of the network? Is the mapping from $h(\\texttt{[NUM]})$ to its numerical value by way of MSE loss minimization linear? I'd imagine that the output range would be restricted in this setup. \n\n- I'm a bit put off by the dependence on _parsing_ numerical quantities accurately, especially in messier settings.
