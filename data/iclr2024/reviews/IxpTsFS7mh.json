The paper highlights that current state-of-the-art methods based on Transformers are computationally inefficient due to their quadratic complexity in sequence length and primarily focus on non-probabilistic point estimation. To overcome these limitations, the paper introduces a novel transformer architecture called VQ-TR. VQ-TR utilizes a discrete set of latent representations in the Attention module, enabling linear scaling with the sequence length and providing effective regularization to prevent overfitting. The authors compare several Transformer-based time series forecasting methods for probabilistic forecasting, and VQ-TR demonstrates competitive performance in forecasting accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage."

A masked attention decoder is used to 'unroll' the forecast. Apart from favorable computational properties, the method appears to clearly outperform the SoTA in transformer-based point and probabilistic forecasting."

Please consider moving these important details forward.\n\nImportantly, the experiment presentation is somewhat misleading. The main paper only compares against transformer baselines where the proposed method appears to categorically outperform the SoTA, however the non-transformer based baselines are moved to the appendix where results are mixed against non-transformer baselines; and less competitive than what the main paper Section 4.4 claims. \n\nA last open point that should be addressed is the choice of the distribution output per dataset. How was this choice made for the baselines? The fact that -iqn and -t survive for VQ-TR in wiki and taxi respectively invites the question how these hyperparameters were selected."
