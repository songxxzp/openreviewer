                "value": "The paper studies how very deep neural networks, including densely connected and convolutional networks, behave at initialization when using sparsity inducing activation functions. The two natural sparsity-inducing functions studied in the paper are the shifted ReLU activation, which is just a ReLU with a fixed bias, and the soft thresholding function, an activation that evaluates to zero in some fixed interval. The main result shows that these activations make the initialization unstable for very deep networks. This instability can be fixed by using a clipped version of these activation functions. The authors show some experiments, demonstrating that deep networks can be trained with a clipped version of the above activation functions, with minor drop in accuracy."

To my understanding, the results only apply for very deep neural networks (the experiments use 100-layer networks). The authors should clarify whether or not their results apply to networks of reasonable depth. Specifically, it would be good to show some experiment for networks of reasonable depth and show how the activation choice affects the behavior. It seems that in this setting depth is only hurting performance, so while it is in theory interesting to analyze how such deep networks should be trained, it seems that the applicability of this method is limited.\n\nThe authors should also discuss the effect of adding residual connections on the stability of the network training. As residual-networks has been the main solution for training very deep networks, the authors should clarify whether their results also apply for residual networks.\n\nAdditionally, it seems that some of the experiments were left out of the main paper, and only appear in the appendix (for example, studying the CST activation and comparing the clipped activations with non-clipped ones). These are key experiments in the paper and should appear in the main text."

They provide a theoretical analysis of the instability effects for using shifted ReLU and SoftThreshold when training FeedForward networks and CNNs, motivating their clipped versions of these functions. The authors use the previously introduced EoC initialization and show why training is stable, and becomes unstable with the introduction of a modified ReLU activation function that should induce sparsity.\nTo remedy the instability in training a further modification (clipping) is introduced and proven to be theoretically stable. They then demonstrate the feasibility of their CReLU and CST activation functions for training deep and wide networks on MNIST and CIFAR10, showing only minor degradation in prediction accuracy with tunable levels of activation sparsity.\n\nOverall, the paper is nicely written and relatively easy to follow, despite the math-heavy theoretical section. The argumentation on instability of the shifter ReLU and SoftThreshold seems valid, and the experiments, though not extensive, provide a proof-of-concept of the author\u2019s claim. The idea of clipping the activation functions to achieve stability is as simple as it is effective, providing a valid contribution that can be actually translated into application.  However, a bit more in-depth evaluation of certain aspects would be nice. The findings are interesting, though presentation is lacking, as well as more exploration of the introduced concept."
