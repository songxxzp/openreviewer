Given the hurdles of data sparsity and imbalance, the authors put forth a novel causal prediction framework dubbed \"NuwaDynamics\". Operating through two phases - \"Discovery\" and \"Update\" - this paradigm pinpoints causal regions within datasets and endows the model with causal reasoning prowess. The authors also substantiate their methodology with proofs drawn from causal theory and employ a myriad of experimental results to demonstrate its efficacy across various spatio-temporal benchmark tests, especially in tasks like extreme weather forecasting and long-term temporal predictions. In a nod to fostering collaboration and transparency, the code from this research has been shared with the public, marking a valuable contribution to the open-source arena."

It is interesting to employ ViT and Mixup in spatiotemporal data for causal environmental discovery and augmentation, and the work can potentially expand the model's latent observational space in many scarce scenarios.\n\n3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework. The authors introduced architectures tailored for both ViT and non-ViT, while also including control experiments across frameworks such as RNN and CNN. Comparisons across multiple mainstream tasks, including transfer learning and super-resolution prediction, further demonstrates its capabilities in tasks like extreme event prediction.\n\n4. Detailed theoretical validation based on causal manipulation is provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. Interestingly, in real-world scenarios, the author doesn't explore all possible environments but instead introduces partial perturbations, which conveniently addresses the computational constraints and limited data availability in practice."

Especially when it comes to the mixup technique, is it possible to automatically adjust the fusion hyperparameters of each environmental patch based on a specific dataset? If this cannot be achieved at the moment, I hope the authors will offer potential solutions in their section of future work .\n\n2. I also have a keen interest in environmental perturbation methods. In fact, environmental perturbation can be considered a form of data augmentation. I wonder, are there any generative methods in computer vision (CV) that can be integrated into this? If the answer is affirmative, I hope the authors delve deeper into this in the \"Related Work\" and \"Model\" sections.\n\n3. The experimental section of the paper is rich in content, and I am particularly interested in spatio-temporal system modeling. Current research literature mainly focuses on datasets with lower resolution, for example, roughly 256x256 in size. I hope the authors can consider more experiments to explore whether these methods remain competitive on high-resolution datasets. If the authors can achieve superior results on higher-resolution datasets, I might consider further raising my score."

Coupled with a straightforward mixup augmentation, it achieves a very refined alignment. From my perspective, NuwaDynamics has the potential to revolutionize how models recognize causality in ST data mining realm. This may provide a new approach to solving such problems (data scarcity and the high cost of deploying sensors). \n\n(2) The paper reads very well, and hardly has any errors or inconsistencies. Information is provided at the right point, is complete and accurate. The split between main paper and supplementary material is good. The narrative and exposition flow well. Meanwhile, the paper is well-structured, I appreciate its visual aids.\n\n(3) Providing a causal intervention perspective for data augmentation seems interesting. In terms of practical implementation, utilizing attention scores without introducing additional complex designs seems both simple and effective. Additionally, I believe the backdoor adjustment mechanism proposed by the authors serves as a robust theoretical foundation. This contributes significantly to enhancing generalization, especially in out-of-distribution scenarios.\n\n(4) Baselines are strong, relevant, discussed well and evaluated fairly. A large number of analytic experiments complete the main findings. Meanwhile, experimental setups are presented accurately and consistently, at an adequate level of detail."
