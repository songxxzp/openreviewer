            "questions": {
                "value": "It is very unclear how the graph auto-encoder (GAE) is applied in the pipeline. A graph autoencoder for attributed graphs performs node feature convolutions over the graph to arrive at a $n \\times d_a$ representation of the graph, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $d_a$ is the size of the inner hidden dimension. It is possible to reconstruct an $n\\times n$ low-rank estimated graph from this latent representation. We must consider this in light of the authors' statements:\n * Q1: The authors describe the GAE baseline as follows: \"GAE: clusters $O$, after passing it through our graph autoencoder, described in Section 2.4\". It is not at all clear how one can \"cluster $O$\" from the output of the GAE. To cluster $O$, you need to cluster the columns of some matrix with column dimension $d(O)$. Since the output of a GAE is either $n\\times d_a$ or $n\\times n$, it is not at all clear how one can \"cluster $O$\" after \"passing it through\" a GAE. Can the authors elaborate?\n * Q2: In S2.4.2, the authors write \"We could apply tSNE directly to the GAE output.\" As above, this lacks a formal description, and it is ambiguous how this could actually be achieved. Again, we would need to apply tSNE to some $k \\times d(O)$ matrix, which would result in a tSNE-estimated $2 \\times d(O)$ matrix. How does the GAE output allow for this?\n * Q3: Figure 2 implies that somehow the GAE output is used in the distance metric computation. However, this is never described (even vaguely). The formula for the distance metric (given in Section 2.3) includes only the original attribute data $O$ and the inverse laplacian $L^{+}$, which is derived from the original graph $G$. How does the GAE output feed into this?\n * Q4: The authors write \"We could apply tSNE directly to the GAE output. However that would mean that tSNE is seeking for the best representation of the data in an Euclidean space, which is not appropriate because we know the dimensions of our observations are related to each other in $G$\". The plausibility of this reasoning is hard to evaluate because we don't know how the GAE is being applied. It is quite possible that (depending on how the GAE fed into the tSNE module), tSNE is actually *not* being applied in a \"Euclidean\" space, because the output of the GAE directly convolves the node features with the graph structure. Can the authors please clarify this statement, as well as the application of GAE itself?\n\nQ5: The only justification the authors give for their distance metric, which is arguably a core part (if not *the* core part) of the contribution, is very weak:\n\n\"Previous work shows that this formula gives a good notion of distance between $o_1$ and $o_2$ on a network Coscia (2020). For instance, it can recover the infection and healing parameters in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model by comparing two temporal snapshots of an epidemic.\"\n\nTo the best of my understanding, there is no immediate connection between a metric's ability to estimate SIR parameters and a metric's ability to cluster data well. Can the authors please elaborate their justification for this choice?\n\nQ6: While the approximation to $L^{+}$ seems efficient (see Section 3.4), the authors did not explore how the approximation affects the performance of the algorithm. Could the authors please replicate the simulations and real data analyses using the approximation to $L^{+}$ rather than the exact solution? This would be a welcome addition to the appendix.\n\nQ7: From a methodological perspective, the conclusions that a practioner can draw from the empirical study is very limited. This is because the baselines of the proposed pipeline do almost as well as the pipeline on the real-world data. In particular, for each dataset, two out of the top-3 scoring approaches do not use the proposed graph distance at all. Again on each dataset, ablations that *do* use the graph distance have at-most middle-ranks, and one of the scores for the full pipeline (GAE+GE+tSNE) is near-random performance (see Fig 4(a)). Can the authors further justify the use of their pipeline in light of these results?\n\nIf the authors can answer these questions satisfactorily and provide a substantial revision, I might be able to raise my score."

In the experimental study, the paper compares to preliminary embedding methods like node2vec, which have been superseded by other more recent works in the literature. Thus it is hard to judge the success of the method in experimental terms.\n\nMore importantly, it is hard to judge this paper because the problem definition is written in a manner that is hard to make sense of. It is claimed that the proposed method clusters node attributes rather than nodes. It is hard to understand what that means, since nodes are represented by their attributes and the method claims to take the network connections in consideration as well.\n\nThe problem definition says that we look for a function f : G \u00d7 O \u2192 P returning the partition P such that arg minO \u03b4 = f(G, O), \u03b4 being the function calculating the distance between pairs of observations on G. Nothing is clear in this definition. For example:\n\n- What is mean to apply a function f on the whole of G and O?\n- Where is the pair of observations on which the function \u03b4 is applied?\n- What exactly is the stated objective expressed as arg minO \u03b4 = f(G, O)? Are we looking for a set O or a member of O?\n- What should the entity we are looking for minimize?\n\nThe explanation offered in words is a bit better than the mathematical statement, yet still unclear: \"we want to find the partition P of O such that the graph distance \u03b4 over G of observations within the same group in P is minimized \u2013 excluding trivial solutions that put each observation in a singleton cluster. This definition hinges on \u03b4: the ability to calculate the graph distances between two o1, o2 \u2208 O.\" The following questions emerge:\n\n- What is the definition of a partition?\n- What is the newly named graph distance \u03b4?\n- Which exact distance, out of all pairs in a group, would be minimized?\n- How are trivial solutions to be excluded?\n\nGiven this incompleteness, the paper is unready for publication."

                "value": "1. The biggest problem with this paper is that the model innovation is not enough. In short, the authors propose a distance metric that considers graph structure based on the scheme of Coscia et al. (2020) and apply it to t-SNE to reduce feature dimensions, thereby achieving the goal of clustering node attributes. From my perspective, this does not meet the standard of an academic paper that will be presented at a prestigious conference.\n2. The expression in this paper is not concise enough. It is not until the fourth paragraph of the introduction that the main objective of this paper is revealed. The main contribution of the method is the generalized Euclidean proposed in Section 2.3, and many other redundant contents need to be deleted.\n3. The expression in this paper is not clear enough. For example, why clean noise, and why can AE clean noise? Why don't other models consider this, and what is the motivation for choosing AE? These are not explained clearly.\n4. Even the title is not clear enough. Unsupervised learning is too broad and cannot represent node attribute clustering.\n5. The authors should have a section introducing related work."
