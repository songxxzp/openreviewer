                "value": "1. The baseline table is useful for future work to compare against. However, this table does not seem relevant to motivating the proposed framework and could be included in the appendix. To better motivate the value of the proposed unifying framework, it would be useful to show more experiments regarding significant differences in model performance when different experiment methods are used (outcome labels, cohort selection, etc.). For example, you could consider an ablation study to show that model performance significantly improves or decreases based on various outcome definitions for datasets with consistent preprocessing, model choice, hyperparameters. The experiment mentioned in the paper regarding exclusion criteria would also be a good example to elaborate on and include table results comparing impact of different exclusion criteria.\n\n2. Be specific about performance gains and losses (example: improved by XX%) and their statistical significance. A significant difference in model performance due to unaligned data preprocessing and processing pipeline would help motivate the proposed unifying framework. Stating that \u201cdifferences were bigger for some datasets than others\u201d is not a robust explanation. \n\n3. Novel ML research often proposes a new model that is evaluated across multiple datasets. Enabling support for new models to be easily integrated into this framework is important. The appendix provides example code for training a specific model, such as those in scikit-learn or implemented in pytorch. Including more thorough explanation and/or code examples for how to train a novel/custom model, such as pytorch-based model implemented in a separate python file, would be useful. \n\n4. The author mentions flexibility of the repo in allowing users to configure data preprocessing in a streamlined fashion across multiple datasets. However, does this somewhat deflate the original purpose to enable reproducible research through consistent dataset preprocessing and processing. Researchers may still conduct research with various preprocessing steps that differ across literature. The value of this framework hinges on if research exactly states the detailed use of YAIB in their paper/methods AND if future work follows these exact same steps. It would be useful if the author's address this point and potentially expand their unifying framework to include recommended approaches for how to reference/cite use of YAIB in future work that could promote reproducible research. \n\nThe low score is mostly because of points 1-3. If these points are addressed I would be happy to raise the score."

Does the repo have support to enable users to define their own outcome definitions across datasets? For example, a patient AKI outcome may occur when patient creatinine falls below a specific threshold. Or are outcome labels strictly based on definitions included in the datasets?\n\n2. Are models other than those in scikit-learn hardcoded into the repo or are there wrappers for these as well? Is there support for users to include and evaluate new/customized model architectures in the pipeline?\n\n3. Is there a reason why this framework is limited to ICU/healthcare settings and not time series in general. I could see a pipeline like this being applicable to time series from many domains. It may be worth elaborating on why the framework is ICU-specific. It may also be useful to compare YAIB to similar non-healthcare related frameworks."

The originality of this paper lies in that 1) it utilizes the full datasets of five open-source ICU datasets, and for the first time introduced the AmsterdamUMCdb (AUMCdb) dataset into a benchmark 2) it is built on a flexible framework which decouples each individual module and allows users to easily add new tasks or adjust current modules.\n\n**Quality**: This paper specifically accounted for the common issues that researchers encounter when using ICU benchmarks, such as the lack of comparisons across multiple datasets, different task/cohort definitions. Via extensive experiments, this paper demonstrated the utilities of the proposed framework and analyzed the potential impact of small perturbations to the task/cohort definitions by ablation studies. The experiment results supported their claims that 1) comparable results can be achieved when different datasets are harmonized and ML pipelines are unified 2) small changes in definitions can lead to different results.\n\n**Clarity**: This paper is clear and well-written. The tables and figures are informative and easy to understand.\n\n**Significance**: Data processing and clinical task definition have always been a burden for researchers in machine learning for healthcare. Once made public, this work has the potential to help reduce the overhead in benchmarking and developing new ICU prediction methods. This work will also allow researchers to validate their findings by evaluating and comparing the results on multiple real-world ICU datasets. Thanks to the modular implementation, researchers working on other tasks involving ICU data, e.g. reinforcement learning or representation learning, may also benefit from some modules in the proposed framework.

Based on the experiments, it seems that the time series features are extracted from numeric data rather than waveform data (please correct me if I am wrong). Currently, most ICU benchmarks used numeric data for prediction tasks and only very few used waveform data, but waveform data are very informative and may greatly help improve the predictive performance. Thus I think the contribution would be more solid if waveform data can be utilized for a new ICU benchmark. \n\n3. Basic statistics of the datasets, e.g. number of patients, ICU stays, and the prevalence of classes or the range of regression targets, are missing in the main paper (found them in appendix). Inclusion of such information will help readers get a general idea of the datasets and understand some of the experiment results, e.g. the discrepancy in the performances shown in Figure 2 may be due to the difference in prevalence in mortality across the datasets.

In Section 4 Preprocessing, for the aggregated features, what are the time windows for aggregation and the frequencies that you update those features? Is there any specific consideration in the choice for them?\n\n3. In Table 4, it would be helpful to also include the range or the units of KF/LoS, or additionally show the MAEs as % relative to the valid ranges of KF/LoS (absolute MAEs do not provide much information).\n\n4. A minor typo, a space is missing between \"repository\" and \"to\" near the bottom on Page 4."

However, while the paper's central claim is the adaptability of the YAIB benchmark to other datasets, tasks, and models, this assertion necessitates a comprehensive experience with the benchmark, which is challenging to evaluate during the brief review period.\n\n- Datasets like MIMIC and eICU are highly complex and heterogeneous. The proposed YAIB benchmark only supports 52 clinical features (mainly vital signs and lab tests). A vast amount of other available features are ignored (like diagnosis, prescriptions, clinical notes, x-rays). This limited feature support might hinder future model advancements (which can be seen in Tables 3 & 4 where the performance between classic ML and DL models are very similar)."
