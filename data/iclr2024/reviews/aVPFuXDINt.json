The main methodological novelty of the paper is how to incorporate an aggregation mechanism across various edge types through two possible different schemes: update-then-aggregate and aggregate-then-update. For what concerns the datasets, two new temporal heterogeneous graphs are introduced in the paper: TaobaoTH (a dataset of user behaviour provided from Taobao - an online shopping platform) and SteemitTH (a dataset of user interactions from Steemit - a blockchain-based social network). The proposed model is evaluated on multi-relation and mono-relational link prediction on the proposed datasets plus two other datasets that have already been used in the literature (GDELT18, ICEWS18). The approach appears to perform well on the considered datasets when compared to 9 selected baselines."

On top of this, while yes the method appears to show good results on the considered datasets compared to the baselines, I\u2019ve some doubts about the experimental evaluation. In particular, have the baselines considered in the experiment been tuned for the dataset? Taking for instance TGN from Rossi et al, the model was not evaluated on any of the datasets used in the paper. As such, if such architecture was not tuned (as instead the proposed approach was), we might be observing lower performance for such methods (as well as the other baselines), which are simply due to a suboptimal architectural choice. I\u2019d greatly appreciate if the authors could comment on this in their rebuttal"

This suggests that many models are actually not learning anything meaningful on that dataset. Can you please clarify why this might be the case? \n\n2) The fact that TGN and CAW do not compute in their implementation the MRR, I believe it\u2019s not a good reason to avoid computing such statistics for these methods. I\u2019d encourage the authors to fix the implementation in this case to provide a better comparison of all methods.\n\n3) I\u2019m confused why many MRRs appear equal to 0.5, can the authors provide some details on the implementation they used for this and how negatives were sampled?\n\n4) In section 4 it is stated that \u201cminimum number of snapshots to allow live-update evaluation\u201d is four, can you provide some details on why that is the case? From algorithm 2 in ROLAND my understanding is that 2 steps are enough for live update evaluation"

In contrast, temporal networks are more dynamically changing where each edge is associated with a timestamp (not a snapshot).\n2.

The number of edges of TaobaoTH is even smaller than the number of nodes. Can you elaborate why this graph is so sparse?\n\n3. The evolutivity of TaobaoTH is extremely low. Does it mean there are very few new edges across snapshots? Or is it because at different snapshots, edges are repetitive (e.g., user viewed an item at snapshot-1 and viewed the same item at snapshot-2)? On this question, I think it's also worth reporting the repetitive metrics of the datasets."
