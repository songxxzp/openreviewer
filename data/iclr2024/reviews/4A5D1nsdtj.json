                "value": "Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become increasingly prevalent due to their strong performance in handling heterophily in graph data. However, optimal graph filters rely on a complex process and, to bypass this complexity, numerous polynomial filters have been proposed. These polynomial filters are designed to approximate the desired graph filters. A significant challenge arises because these polynomial methods mainly focus on specific types of graph structures. They struggle to accommodate graphs that display a diverse range of homophily and heterophily degrees.The paper aims to address this challenge by understanding the relationship between polynomial bases of designed graph filters and the diverse homophily and heterophily degrees in graphs. After the analysis, an adaptive heterophily basis is developed. The paper then integrates this with a homophily basis, leading to the creation of a universal polynomial filter known as \"UniFilter\". \n\nFundamentally, it seems that the adaptive basis ensures that the subsequent elements of the basis do not become too similar with higher k. The choice of this dissimilarity has been done in a very specific way, by computing signal specific basis vectors which are called heterophily basis in the paper. Unifilter is the combination of the standard polynomial basis with this heterophily basis. This combination is shown to give consistently good performance across varying range of homophily/heterophily datasets."

For this method, the knowledge of the homophily ratio seems to be important. In many practical scenarios, this may not be possible to be estimated accurately and even approximations could be difficult. No ablation study is presented showing the sensitivity of this model to the accurate knowledge of the homophily ratio.\n3. The HetFilter seems to degrade rapidly past h=0.3 whereas OrtFilter is lot more graceful to the varying homophily ratio. It is unclear whether one would consider the presented fluctuations as inferior to the presented UniBasis. For UniBasis, in the region of h >= 0.3, the choice of tau should become extremely important (as is evident from Figure 4, where lower tau values can reduce performance on Cora by about 20 percentage points)."
