The framework proposed consists of a method for analyzing the stability of a given optimization algorithm, based on the notions of boundedness and expansivity of the corresponding update rule. The update rules considered all correspond to zeroth order analogues of first order optimization algorithms, where a first order oracle is approximately simulated using queries to the values of the objective function (i.e., a zeroth order oracle). The simulated oracles considered are based on either 1-point, 2-point or coordinate-wise approximation, and the latter achieves the tightest generalization bounds for each of the algorithms considered, matching, in each case, the best known bounds achievable by the corresponding first order algorithms in each of the cases where the objective is strongly convex, convex or non-convex. The algorithms considered are Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent as well as Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient method. The theoretical guarantees of the paper are accompanied by experimental results on real world data."

While previous stability analysis results were limited to the basic 2-point zeroth-order estimate with a Gaussian distribution in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms, this paper introduces a general proof framework for stability analysis. This framework is applicable to convex, strongly convex, and non-convex conditions and provides results for various zeroth-order optimization algorithms, including SGD, gradient descent (GD), and stochastic variance-reduced gradient (SVRG) methods. It also covers different zeroth-order estimates, such as 1-point and 2-point estimates with various distributions and coordinate estimates. The general analysis reveals that coordinate estimation can lead to improved generalization bounds for SGD, GD, and SVRG versions of zeroth-order optimization algorithms by reducing the expansion in stability analysis."
