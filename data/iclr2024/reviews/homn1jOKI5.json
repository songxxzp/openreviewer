Specifically, section 4 contains the \"method\", theoretical analyses, and examples, where section 5 made reference to section 4 but the algorithm is delayed until the appendix. I think it makes more sense to first introduce the method, provide intuitions of why it works, and then give the theoretical analyses with additional remarks.\n   * The Algorithm in Appendix A is not well-written. For example, it is unclear how $\\boldsymbol{S}_t$ in line 5 is used later. The $\\tau^t$ in line 11 is also different from that in lines 7 and 9. Furthermore, it is unclear where the algorithm starts because the line numbers for inputs are intertwined with those for algorithmic steps.\n\n* Experiments:\n    * As explained in the paper, it is expected that standard CP does not work (e.g., in terms of reaching the coverage guarantees). I expect to see additional baselines for this setting that can be compared.\n    * Missing examples on larger graphs. For example, the Flickr and Reddit2 datasets in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14555.pdf. These examples have considerably more nodes than the current settings.\n    * Missing standard deviation of results. From Figure 3 and 4, it seems the standard deviations can be high (I assume each line with light color indicates results from a specific run).\n    * Presentation needs to be improved. For example, the left column of Figure 3 and the Figure 4 have too many lines that affects readability. It is best to just show the average values with error bars. In addition, the authors considered 4 GNN models, but results for some more recent ones are only in the appendix. \n    * Misleading Table 1: it says \"average deviation from guarantee\", but it does not mean a higher deviation necessarily means worse performance. This is because if deviation is positive, this indicates over-coverage, which is still acceptable (one just needs to lower the significance level). In fact, this seems to be the case from looking at Figure 3."

The idea of standard CP is mentioned in section 2, but that section is for general CP and transductive GNNs. I think the details should be discussed in the appendix with a reference in the main text, unless the baseline is taken directly from existing methods. Also, I think the abbreviation \"std. CP\" reads too much like standard deviation of CP, so I suggest changing the name.\n   * Does the method always work well on any GNN models being considered? It is helpful and important to discuss the generality and/or limitation of the method for different GNN baselines\n   * From looking at Figure 3 and 4, it seems standard CP coverages gradually increases as timestep increases. This leads to larger set sizes (as expected). Why is this the case? I think for a meaningful comparison, the empirical coverage should be set the same and then we can compare average set size."

In particular, the proposed CP methods are valid conditional on subgraphs and when stopping at non-adversarial times, especially in cases when standard CP fails to provide the desired coverage. The methods and theory are clearly supported by empirical experiments. \n\nOverall, I think this paper provides interesting discussion, which both extends the current understanding of CP on graph-structure data and forms a solid foundation for future efforts in this direction.

This topic is important for deploying GNNs in critical domains. While existing discussion mainly focuses on transductive setting, or only provides approximate and not-actionable guarantees for other settings, this paper stands out by providing solid theory, method, and experiments on node-exchangeable and edge-exchangeable settings. By thoroughly exploring the exchangeability structure in these settings, existing CP methods can be applied to solve seemingly challenging problems in this field. Thus, I think this paper makes a significant contribution to this topic, and will inspire future research efforts of the community.\n\n2. Originality. \n\nThe idea of this paper is original and provides novel insights. \n\n3. Quality. \n\nThis is a thorough paper with solid theory, fruitful discussion, and concrete experiments. \n\n4.

These are all important factors for the validity of CP. While I believe the technical discussion in this paper is correct, sometimes I have to further check the statements in my own mind as some crucial mathematical terminologies are missing. A few possible points that deserve clarification include (1) formal definition of node and edge exchangeability, (2) clearly state the conditions on the score function and how the model is trained, (3) formal definition and examples of the \"evaluation mask\", etc. Please see my questions part.

Mathematical definition of node exchangeability and edge exchangeability.\n\nI suggest adding a formal definition for node and edge exchangeability, just to avoid any confusion. It will also be beneficial to mention some important implications of such exchangeability, e.g., at each time $t$, the existing nodes are exchangeable, so on and so forth. \n\n2. Rigorous terminology in explaining Proposition 1.\n\nCurrently the explanation via $Z=AXW$ after Proposition 1 can be improved by using rigorous terminologies. For instance, in \"For the guarantee to be valid the first two blocks of the result must be row-exchangeable.\", it is unclear what \"the first two blocks of the result\" is, which is harmful for understanding. Also, related to question 1, \"For Mat(1) row-exchangeability already holds from Theorem 2\" can be further clarified by pointing out that nodes in cal and eval are exchangeable due to node exchangeability. I suggest the authors revise this part to improve clarity. \n\n3. How is the evaluation set $\\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ decided? \n\nI am a bit confused how one decides the evaluation set at each time. Is there a pre-defined rule, for instance, do we evaluate all newly arrived nodes immediately at each time $t$, or do we pre-fix the set of indices that will be evaluated at each time $t$? I was asking because if $\\mathcal{V}_{eval}^{(t)}$ is data-dependent, it may need more efforts in justifying the approach/theory. \n\n4. Definition of $Cov(\\mathbb{I}_T)$.\n\nThis is an important quantity in the theorem, and it shall be formally defined. \n\n5. Requirement on score function in Prop 1 and Theorem 3. \n\nIt seems to me that under node exchangeability, one still has exchangeability between calibration and evaluation nodes. However, it is now crucial how the score function $s$ is trained. At least it should be permutation invariant to these nodes? But nothing is mentioned there. I suggest revising this proposition (and its proof, which is a bit handwavy). Similarly for Theorem 3. \n\n6. Is there a technical result for the validity of weighted CP in edge-exchangeable setting? \n\nThe discussion for edge exchangeability (the end of Section 4) is interesting, but incomplete as there is no formal theorem on the validity of weighted CP. I would suggest adding a formal theorem, with clear description on how the edge appears (e.g., it is more clear to state that edges are uniformly sampled from a candidate edge set). \n\n\n-------\nsmall typos & wording questions:\n1. Section 4, line 3: \"callibration node\" should be \"calibration node\"\n\n2. Lemma 1, \"defined on a subsets of $\\mathcal{X}$\"\n\n3. I don't really understand the sentence \"Specifically we can not use the prediction sets of a particular node multiple times to compare and pick a specific one (see \u00a7 D.4 for a discussion).\" in the second paragraph of Section 5."
