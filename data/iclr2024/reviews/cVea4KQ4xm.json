While the settings are not the same, the techniques are somehow similar. \n2. Because the notion of equal treatment is strictly stronger than the demographic fairness notion, it can be much more challenging to attain ET in practice than DP. Moreover, the trade-off between fairness and accuracy may make ET less suitable for real applications. While the paper has compared the two notions, it is still not convincing why equal treatment is a superior notion. It is helpful if authors can provide more justification with a real example.\n3. While the settings with non-linear models and non-i.i.d. data are considered in experiments, most theoretical results and illustrating examples are limited to linear models and i.i.d. data.

The explanation distribution relies on an explanation function, for which Shapley value is used as the example in the paper, to quantity how non-protected features affect the trained model. Based on the new ET definition, they also designed a Classifier Two Sample Test (C2ST) to test whether a ML model provides equal treatment based on the AUC of the model. In numerical experiments, the authors demonstrated that the new ET definition is more effective at inspecting treatment equality in a model, and their method could provide explanation for the underlying causes of treatment inequality."

To my understanding, it is well-recognized in the fair ML literature that equal treatment and equal outcome are different concepts.

Instead, one simplified interpretation of equal treatment is \u201cfairness through unawareness\u201d or \u201ccolorblindness\u201d. Rather than relying on the distinction between \u2018equal outcome vs. equal treatment\u2019, which can refer to much more high-level philosophical differences than what is captured in this paper, I would find it clearer to simply focus on equal treatment (new definition) vs. demographic parity."

However, my concerns arise in cases where the demographic parity is violated only by a small amount, which is the case in practice; no (useful) algorithm has a demographic parity of exactly zero, and most of the decision making algorithms usually have a small violation tolerance. Can the authors comment how equal treatment can be used on bounding demographic parity, or whether there exists any relationship there? This scenario is important for e.g., credit lending scenarios; in the U.S., the Equal Credit Opportunity Act [2] enforces no discrimination *on the outcomes* of the decision-making algorithm. From a law standpoint, one might not necessarily mind different explanations as long as the outcomes are not too dissimilar (i.e., low demographic parity).\n\n(b) First of all, unfortunately using AUC as a test statistic for classifier-two-sample test is not novel, see [1] for example (the good thing is that AUC is a relatively well behaved statistic, so that does not change the framework). By using a C2ST in the framework, we introduce (i) a data-driven algorithm to judge the level of equal treatment in the data but also (ii) an additional notion of uncertainty in our fairness definition. For (i), in practice this means that this approach is not necessarily low-sample-size friendly (as it does not use permutations), the complexity of the classifier directly affects type I and type II error and results may vary considerably according to which classifier is chosen (which the authors have actually explored in the Appendix). For (ii), we are rejecting the null-hypothesis with a certain probability threshold, as opposed to provide a single (deterministic) number as in demographic parity. That is, we are now guaranteeing that \"up to a level 1-\\alpha\" the algorithm is providing equal treatment. Citing again the equal credit opportunity act of 1961, such a definition of fairness would not be admissible in a credit lending scenario, which puts into question once again the practical feasibility of this new definition of equal treatment.\n\n[1] Model-independent detection of new physics signals using interpretable SemiSupervised classifier tests, Chakravarti, Purvasha and Kuusela, Mikael and Lei, Jing and Wasserman, Larry, The Annals of Applied Statistics, 2023\n[2] https://www.justice.gov/crt/equal-credit-opportunity-act-3#:~:text=prohibits%20creditors%20from%20discriminating%20against,under%20the%20Consumer%20Credit%20Protection\n\n\nFor completeness, I am personally unsure whether ICLR is the best venue to reach the type of audience who would be interested in this work.

The paper advocates for the use of Shapley values to distribute explanations when defining equal treatment. However, the rationale for this preference is unclear to me. A notable limitation of this fairness notion is its potential indirect correlation with protected attributes like Z. For example, height is often closely associated with gender. Therefore, a model's Shapley values may not depend on the protected attribute Z and might predominantly base predictions on height equally across different gender groups, which superficially appears gender-neutral and meets the paper's fairness criteria, yet it may still result in substantial unfairness. I welcome corrections if my understanding of Shapley values is inaccurate.\n- [Major] The paper omits a critical discussion on related work. There appears to be a study, specifically on individual fairness [1], that resonates with the motivations of this paper. Individual fairness emphasizes that individuals with similar backgrounds (e.g., salary, job status) should receive similar treatment. However, this paper does not draw any comparisons with its own concept of fairness to that of individual fairness.\n- [Medium] The motivation presented within the paper is somewhat unclear, and it is concerning that significant discussions related to the work are relegated to the appendix. This decision diminishes the visibility and importance of such discussions.\n- [Medium] I cannot agree with the authors that equal opportunity could lead to reverse discrimination and overcorrection. As far as I know, equal opportunity is proposed to address these limitations you mentioned which suffered by demographic parity. Can you cite the corresponding works that draw this conclusion?\n- [Medium] Although Shapley values are central to defining 'equal treatment', they are introduced late in the appendix. It is my suggestion that the authors reconsider the organization of the paper, as many pivotal elements seem to be understated by their placement in the appendix.\n\nReference:\n\n- Cynthia Dwork, Moritz Hardt, Toniann Pitassi, Omer Reingold, and Richard S.

                "value": "Operationalized tool: ``explanationspace `` https://explanationspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auditTutorial.html\n- I tried out the code, and while I found it impressive, several issues made the test hard.  \n  - When I investigated an example: https://explanationspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/audits.html,  I realized that installing ``explanationspace`` from  https://pypi.org/project/explanationspace/#description was effective whereas the provided step in the installation doc didn't work (https://explanationspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)\n  - The Fairness Audits: Equal Treatment example uses ``fairtools. detector import ExplanationAudit``. I couldn't find the documentation for the functions from https://pypi.org/project/FAIRtools, and the described functions directly below the example correspond to ``explanationspace.audits.ExplanationAudit``. I changed other aspects of the code(``from fairtools.detector import ExplanationAudit`` to ``from explanationspace import ExplanationAudit`` and ``detector.fit(X, y, Z=\"var4\")`` to ``detector.fit(X, yu, Z=X[\"var4\"])`` and .get_auc_val() to predict_proba).\n- Authors should please improve the documentation in terms of ``all`` the required packages to install (requirements.txt) and the description of results in the tutorial to facilitate easy usage and adoption.  \n\nPaper structuring and related works: \n- While the authors propose an interesting perspective, the paper's structuring makes it hard to appreciate their contributions. The crucial and informative information that could have made the paper stronger is relegated to the appendix. \nFor example, the better experiments, presentation, explanation of results, and the description of explanation functions used, among others, are in the appendix. \n\n- In the introduction and section 2, several introduced ideas are not well connected or explained.  There are so many ideas, it's easy to miss the gist. Additionally, the paper is more oriented towards using explanation methods (SHAP and LIME) to investigate disparities in feature importance across protected groups. However, the authors provide insufficient related work in the area and problem background.  For example, there are lots of similarities between this work and other works; ``Model Explanation Disparities as a Fairness Diagnostic``: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01704.pdf, ``Explanability for fair machine learning``:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07389.pdf.\n\nMethodology\n- To me, some proofs and examples seem limited and don't explore corner cases. For example, I think that the statistical independence of Z from the explanation of features is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the statistical independence of the model from Z. Additionally, in example 4.3, feature X_{3} not being statistically independent of Z and the function being a linear model makes it easy to do the proof through zeroing out that features.  In most cases, the function/model might not be linear, and the relationship between features might be complex and causal graphs hard to uncover. It seems like maybe the tool being diagnostic instead of a fixture might be a better point of view. \n- Given that one might not have access to test data, would it be better to apply the ET inspector as a diagnostic on the train/val data instead? \n\nDiscussion and Experiments in the main body\n- It's hard to appreciate authors' experiments and results because of the following reasons; \n  - The experiment setup of 3 features and one with varied dependence on Z makes it hard to appreciate the author's contributions.\n  - The authors don't provide sufficient explanations or discussion of the results.\n  - Authors could have compared their experimental results to other related works and shown the impact on ET inspector and explanations on fairness on the different groups (something similar to table 5 in the appendix). \n\nMinor or okay to address later\n- Having an algorithm or bulleted procedure could have improved readability.\n- For novelty, authors use AUC rather than accuracy in their C2ST instead of accuracy as previously done.  This is a bit of a tradeoff, and while the scale invariance might be good, it is damaging when inspecting other cases of fairness where one might, for example care more about false positives than false negatives. \n- Given the importance of understanding the features of fairness, I think it might be important to distinguish between protected and sensitive attributes.  Not all protected features are sensitive attributes. For example, gender plays a key role in admission to single-sex schools, or age plays a crucial role in admission to age-range sports or activities. \n- Reliance on Z as a binary variable is restrictive, especially since there are lots of intersectionalities. \n- The explanation highly relies on f_{\\theta}. It might be informative to also look at features independent of the model."
