                "value": "The paper presents a novel method called Goal2FlowNets for learning exploratory goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning settings. The proposed method employs Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn robust goal-conditioned policies that can efficiently generalize to diverse policy covers and is capable of reaching goals through multiple optimal paths. Experiments conducted on various environments, such as MiniGrid and BabyAI, demonstrate that Goal2FlowNets significantly improves sample complexity, zero-shot generalization to new environmental changes, and coverage of the state and goal space."

                "value": "- The paper has significant shortcomings in terms of problem modeling and training details. GFlowNet is adept at handling the generation of discrete objects (and later expanded to continuous scenarios) such as graphs and sets. However, the paper does not clearly specify the specific generated objects in the context of goal-conditioned RL using GFlowNet. Moreover, the paper lacks details on algorithm training and inference processes, such as pseudocode.\n- The paper has gaps in the investigation of related work. The authors mention, \"As far as we know, we are the first to use GFlowNets as policies in a typical RL setting\". However, to my knowledge, there are at least two studies[1,2] that have already applied GFlowNet to RL tasks. \n- Scalability: It is unclear how the proposed method performs in more complex or larger-scale environments. The presented experiments are limited to grid-world tasks, and the scalability of the method to more challenging environments remains unknown.\n    - A discussion of the practicality of Goal2FlowNets in large-scale problems or more complex tasks would be valuable in assessing its applicability in broader contexts.\n- Lack of ablation study: The paper does not provide an ablation study to understand the contribution of specific components of the proposed approach, such as the role of the timestep-augmentation in avoiding cycles in the underlying MDP.\n\n---\n[1] Li, Yinchuan, et al. \"Cflownets: Continuous control with generative flow networks.\" ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] Li, Wenhao, et al. \"Diverse Policy Optimization for Structured Action Space.\" AAMAS 2023."

There are existing works on applying GFlowNets to RL tasks [1,2], which have more complex experimental settings compared to this paper. It would be better for the authors to validate the scalability of the algorithm in non-grid-world scenarios.\n- If the authors consider the trajectory from the source point to the target position as the generative object of GFlowNet, then I have doubts about the poor performance of the SAC algorithm. As stated by the authors of GFlowNet in Section 7.2 of this paper [3], GFlowNet has a relatively close relationship with Max-Ent RL. Specifically, Max-Ent RL tends to explore objects that require more time steps to construct. However, in the grid world, multiple trajectories reaching a specific target position have the same length, so in theory, Max-Ent RL should have similar performance to GFlowNet.\n\n---\n[3] Bengio, Yoshua, et al. \"Gflownet foundations.\" Journal of Machine Learning Research 24.210 (2023): 1-55."
