                "value": "This paper presents FB-GAN, a stock price prediction model based on sentiment analysis. The authors tested the model on historical price data for 5 stocks, and found FB-GAN to outperform a number of baseline models in average. My main concern about this paper is its novelty. The proposed FB-GAN model appears to be a simple extension of WGAN-GP, and the intuition behind the extra modules is not well justified. In addition, the stock universe is too small, which makes the reported results unreliable. I would encourage the authors to explain in more details the design choice of FB-GAN, and to expand the dataset."

The paper is lack of scientific rigor. \n* There is no guardrail for the accuracy of the sentiment analysis. That means we don't know the accuracy of the sentiment scores that are fed into the prediction model. \n* The authors claimed in the model that \"a strong correlation between the market sentiments on the stock price movement\". But there is no  statistical analysis to back the statement up.\n* We need variable control in the comparison between WGAN-GP and FB-GAN. For example, the model WGAN-GP should have the same input dimension as FB-GAN with the sentiment score set to neural.\n\n3. RMSE is not a good metric overall. It does not translate well to trading strategies because large RMSE does not necessarily mean losing money."
