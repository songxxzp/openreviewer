            "questions": {
                "value": "1. The reviewer has a question about the statement \"vector field on latent Riemannian manifolds\". I suppose two interpretations; each of the vector itself should lie on the manifold, or the domain of the field is enclosed on the manifold but the vector can be out of the manifold. In the experimental result (Fig. 2C), the authors point out the \"vectors that protrude the mesh surface\". For the former, this should be an undesirable result, but for the latter, it is okay. An example of the latter case is the normal vector of the Stanford bunny for Figure 2. It is also possible to consider such a problem, but I'm curious if the proposed method can model it. At least I expect the proposed method to work for $m=n-1$ (2D manifold in 3D space), but I doubt it for $m<n-1$ because the Levy-Civita connection is insufficient to address the complementary subspace of the tangent space.\n\n2. The reviewer has some doubts about the term \"unknown manifold\". For 5.1, the training data is dense enough to approximate the manifold well. For 5.2, the authors \"constructed RVGP kernels using the connection Laplacian eigenvectors derived from a k-nearest neighbour graph (k = 5) fit to mesh vertices\". It seems that the Laplacian was computed from 256 vertices, not n=61. If I understand correctly, this violates the prerequisite of \"unknown manifold\". Is there no value in analyzing the relationship between the coverage of the data for the manifold and the accuracy of the vector field prediction? I'm also curious about the analysis of the predicted vector field for out of the manifold to check for regularity."
