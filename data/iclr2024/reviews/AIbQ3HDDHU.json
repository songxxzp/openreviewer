I think significant presentation changes are required to clarify that the paper focuses on inference and finetuning.\n* Most of the methodology appears to me like standard low quantized training techniques, e.g., using additional scales that are determined dynamically, adapted directly to FP8. Could you explain more precisely what exactly is new? I also did not find a Related Work section discussing this in more detail.\n* FP8 inference has been studied extensively by e.g. [3, 4] and also in the context of LLMs [1, 2]. Further, [5] finetunes (and even trains from scratch) large Transformers in FP8. Hence, the overall novelty of the work appears very low.\n\nUnfortunately, as the paper overall does not seem to contain significant novelty, neither in methodology nor in results, I cannot recommend acceptance at this point.\n\n[1] ZeroQuant-FP: A Leap Forward in LLMs Post-Training W4A8 Quantization Using Floating-Point Formats, Wu et al.\n\n[2] Integer or Floating Point?

This methodology is based on roughly matching the dynamic range between the parameters and the 8-bit floating point numerical format. In particular, the exponent bias is either selected dynamically for each parameter ( FP8-AMAX ) or selected uniformly for all parameters (FP8-CSCALE). The paper explores the training of two types of large language models, namely GPT and LIama 2, using FP8 representation for model sizes ranging from 111M to 70B. The results indicate that the performance is on par with the FP16 representation."
