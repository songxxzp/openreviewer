                "value": "This paper looks at the problem of supervised subgraph classification. To handle the scalability issues with the existing models, the authors propose the Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, an efficient data structuring mechanism for manipulating subgraphs prior to model design. They also explore graph coarsening techniques in this context in a data-scarce setting. The authors prove that the S2N node representations approximate the subgraph representations of the original global graph. Their experiments are designed to show that S2N substantially reduces memory and time costs with little degradation in performance."

The authors do not clarify if the considered datasets are adequately large so that the GPU speed/memory really forms a bottleneck for learning. \n\n3. I am not sure about handpicking the Configuration Model (CM) as a justification for low computational complexity of S2N. Why has this model been picked: One could definitely study some other random graph models and ask the same questions?\n\n4. When you coarsen a graph, how is the structure of the original subgraphs preserved? It is not clear how to use the coarsened graph to say something about the subgraphs in the original graph. \n\nOverall, the paper is not substantial enough for significant research impact."

Lack of details for the selection step of the subgraphs to be mapped into new nodes. How do you select the subgraphs and how do you prove that the selected subgraph is the optimal choice?\n4.

For example, the authors \"use two well-known GNNs\" but it is unclear why alternative choices are not discussed or used. Given the abundance of GNN models nowadays and the fact that GCN and GCN2 are relatively earlier (before 2021), it is unclear if the adoption of more recent GNN models could yield better results. The authors mention one baseline, SubGNN, uses pre-trained embeddings by GIN, yet there is no explanation of why GIN can or cannot be used for the proposed methods.\nWhat is more important, the number of layers is tuned between 1 and 2 layers (Section A.3), and it is unclear how much performance fluctuates with even more or less (0 layers, i.e. no message passing) layers. Similarly, it is unclear if alternative readout methods and graph coarsening methods are experimented with. Adding such additional experiments certainly require more work and resource, but would further help improve the soundness of the paper. \n2. I suggest the authors provide more descriptions of existing methods, esp. SubGNN and GLASS. For example, if and what GNN models are used. There is some detail in Appendix A, but an additional section that focuses on the architectural comparison of all the methods would further enhance the clarity of the paper.\n3.

How is the proposed CoS2N related to DiffPool \"Ying, Zhitao, et al. \"Hierarchical graph representation learning with differentiable pooling.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018).\"? At a high level, both of them perform pooling and allow further message passing between the pooled clusters/subgraphs. DiffPool adopts a learnable/differentiable way to pool nodes, whereas the proposed method adopts Variation Edges for coarsening. Of course, the task is different, yet I would like to hear from the authors more about the model-architecture-level comparison. This would help readers better see the novelty of the proposed methods with respect to related work designed for different asks."
