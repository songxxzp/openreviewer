This would provide a more robust validation of the proposed method.\n\nGiven that the small detection models used in the study are contrasted with large language models (LLMs), it would be beneficial to also present results using larger versions of these detection models. This would ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison.\n\nThe paper should incorporate a wider array of multilingual large language models (MLLMs), particularly those trained on Visual Genome (VG) data. A comparison with models like LLaVA 1.5, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with a minimal domain data, is essential. The authors should delve into why evidence-based methods might be superior to sampling fine-tuning techniques in this context."

The study highlights that while traditional small visual models produce professional and accurate outputs, they lack the ability to effectively interact with humans.\n\nThe primary focus of the research is to investigate how small visual models can complement LVLMs by extracting contextual information from images to generate precise answers. The proposed approach, known as \"visual evidence prompting,\" demonstrates a natural mitigation of hallucination in LVLMs. This technique involves providing visual knowledge as context to reduce the hallucination problem. The study includes experiments conducted on three large language models, showing improved performance in addressing object hallucinations and a new benchmark for relation hallucinations.\n\nOverall, the research aims to serve as a baseline for challenging hallucination benchmarks and emphasizes the significance of exploring and analyzing the substantial visual evidence concealed within small visual models before fine-tuning LVLMs. The paper presents an intriguing approach to mitigating hallucination in LVLMs, but there may be room for further clarification and validation of the proposed method in different scenarios and datasets. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide a more detailed discussion of potential applications and practical implications of the findings."
