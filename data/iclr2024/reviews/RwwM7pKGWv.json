                "value": "The authors present an innovative time-series clustering (phenotyping) approach designed to comprehensively capture both the \"observational\" and \"outcome\" dimensions of EHR time-series data. This proposed method incorporates the Dirichlet distribution under a Markovian assumption for cluster assignments and employs a VAE-like structure for forecasting future observations and predicting the outcome of interest, leveraging the cluster assignments and centroids. While distinct from prior works such as AC-TPC, T-Phenotype, and CAMELOT in temporal phenotyping, a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's enhancements and technical contributions (from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives) relative to existing approaches is not clear. The authors should provide a thorough exploration of the practical (clinical) validity of the experimental setup on why it is a valid scenario for the proposed method and not for the previous temporal phenotyping works. Moreover, the authors should sufficiently elucidate the implications of different components and design choices such as the number of clusters introduced in the model."

Additionally, it is unclear how similarity (distance) is measured to compute the Silhouette Index, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Variance Ratio Criterion.\n4.\tExperimental results on benchmarks and baselines appear incomplete. There is a notable absence of results on AC-TPC (as mentioned in Section 4.2) and T-Phenotype, both of which can incorporate either future observations or final outcomes of interest with a simple modification. Furthermore, results on the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) are lacking. The discriminative power of the proposed method should be compared with the same network architecture without incorporating clustering, rather than relying solely on simple ML baselines, which may not be suitable for handling time-series data.\n5.\tThe heterogeneity of time-series EHR data, especially its multiple modalities, which motivated this work, is not thoroughly explored. There is no architectural contribution to address this issue, and the modeling of future outcomes with a Gaussian distribution may not be suitable for binary/categorical observations, which are often prevalent in EHR data."

                "value": "- The paper's technical novelty appears somewhat limited. In particular, it fails to adequately address the unique challenges presented by modeling EHR data compared to other sequential data. It also does not sufficiently explain the novelty in terms of model design compared to existing sequential generative models. It's important to note that in the machine learning context, several VAE-based architectures have been proposed to handle various types of sequential data, such as images, audio, and videos [1, 2].\n\n- The model's design lacks clear explanations or motivation. For instance, it is unclear why VAE was chosen over other generative models for modeling the EHR data distribution. Furthermore, the rationale behind modeling the cluster probability distribution using a Dirichlet distribution remains unexplained.\n\n- Connected to the previous concerns, it's uncertain whether the improvement in prediction performance stems from modeling patient subgrouping or is merely a consequence of the neural network architecture's high capacity. In other words, it is unclear whether patient subgrouping is essential, and the paper does not explore the consequences of removing patient subgrouping from DeepGC. To clarify, why did the authors not use a VAE architecture to model the temporal data (i.e., $P(X,Y)$) directly, instead of modeling $P(X,Y,\\pi)$?\n\n- The concerns raised are somewhat substantiated by the results presented in Table 1. The model with strong patient subgrouping performance (TSKM) does not perform well on downstream prediction tasks. Additionally, DeepGC's performance falls within one standard deviation of the second-best baseline models. Consequently, the paper would benefit from statistical testing to establish the significance of the proposed method.\n\n- Several important technical details are omitted, such as the evaluation of patient subgrouping in an unsupervised setting. Furthermore, the paper does not explain how clustering metrics like SIL, DBI, and VRI were calculated. Data statistics and processing steps are also missing, including information about which clinical features were employed and how missing values were handled.\n\n- The paper lacks the provision of code and supplementary documentation, which would enhance clarity and reproducibility.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] S3VAE: Self-Supervised Sequential VAE\nfor Representation Disentanglement and Data Generation.
