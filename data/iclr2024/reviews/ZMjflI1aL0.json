It focuses on adapting to imbalanced data, shifting classes, and evolving domains. MSCL uses Feature-Distance Based Sample Selection (FDBS) to assess the representability of new data in memory, maintaining awareness of evolving inter-class similarities and intra-class diversity. Additionally, it incorporates a contrastive learning loss (IWL) that encourages similar class instances to be closer while pushing different class instances apart. Experimental results show that MSCL excels in challenging scenarios, enhancing existing CL methods in both balanced and imbalanced data settings."

Further clarification is needed regarding the relationship between the method and its motivation.\n2. Computing the distance of all samples at each time step is time-consuming, which may not be practical for efficient online continual learning.\n3. The method focuses on identifying samples with high intra-class variance and high inter-class similarity, potentially causing the model to overemphasize challenging extreme cases, whereas most samples exhibit low intra-class variance and high inter-class variance (class dissimilarity).\n4. Typically, continual learning experiments provide accuracy changes for each incremental step. It would be beneficial to observe the accuracy changes for each task.\n5. The baseline methods used for comparison seem somewhat outdated, with the most recent one dating back to 2022."

The proposed framework, MSCL, addresses the challenges arising from changes in correlations and diversities of data by continually adjusting previously established class and data representations. The core of MSCL lies in its two main components: Feature-Distance Based Sample Selection (FDBS) and Built-in Contrastive Learning Loss (IWL). The method has been tested on various datasets such as MNIST and Cifar-100. The results show that in balanced data scenarios, MSCL either matches or outperforms leading memory-based CL techniques, marginally. Additionally, the integration of FDBS and IWL enhances the performance of existing rehearsal-based CL methods in both balanced and imbalanced scenarios."

Distance Calculation, 4. Importance Weight Calculation that can add to the computational cost hence overhead of the framework at each step. For example, the FDBS method involves managing a memory set, which includes calculating distances in the feature space and selecting representative samples. The size of the memory set and the dimensionality of the feature space can influence the computational cost and runtime efficiency for this step. The same applies to other steps.\n\n* The authors mentioned Split ImageNet-1k in section 5. Experiment as one of the benchmarks but there are no mention of this dataset in the result section. \n\n* The above comment raises another question: The authors acknowledge the substantial difficulties encountered when dealing with imbalanced data across various classes and domains, citing works by Wu et al. (2019) to underscore this challenge. However, the evaluations suffices to mid-sized datasets. This raises questions about the framework's applicability and performance in large-scale scenarios, which remain unaddressed in the current version of the paper.\n\n* By continuously refining the feature space and adjusting the memory set based on incoming data, the method aims to adapt to changes in the data distribution. However, the paper could provide more details on how the method performs in scenarios with rapid changes in data distribution and whether there are any limitations in its adaptability.\n\n* Lack of visualizations that show how data points are distributed in the feature space leaves the reader without a clear, visual understanding of how the Feature-Distance Based Sample Selection (FDBS) method operates."
