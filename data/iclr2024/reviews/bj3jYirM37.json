However, I think this is slightly unfair for state representation learning. The process of SIMA is obviously more complicated and uses more training objectives. The author should compare it with more solid works on state representation learning for locomotion are, such as [1][2].\n\n\n[1] Takahiro Miki, Joonho Lee, Jemin Hwangbo, Lorenz Wellhausen, Vladlen Koltun, Marco Hutter \"Learning robust perceptive locomotion for quadrupedal robots in the wild\"\n\n[2] Ashish Kumar, Zipeng Fu, Deepak Pathak, Jitendra Malik, \"RMA: Rapid Motor Adaptation for Legged Robots\""

Due to the existence of non-stationary noise, modeling is difficult or impossible. Previous works lack effective solutions for the above problems. In this paper, the authors present a method for learning robust locomotion skills without explicitly modeling noise from environmental observations. Inspired by multi-sensory integration mechanism, the authors first formulate the MDP with an environmental de-noising process as a DRPOP problem. Based on this, the authors propose a Self-supervised randomIzed Masked Argumentation (SIMA) algorithm to learn the internal correlation of multivariate time series and reconstruct latent state representation from noisy observations. The experiments on locomotion control tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs robust locomotion skills under environmental observation noise, and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 15.7% in learning performance."
