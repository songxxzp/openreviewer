Based on this framework, the authors propose to use Markov Decision Process to formulate TE and use SwarMDP method to train RL agents for TE decisions.

            "weaknesses": {

The authors use the RL-based method to solve TE and rely on discrete event-based network simulators (ns-3) to provide realistic network environment, which is widely explored in existing RL-based TE works, and it is not a new idea. Also, the authors list the requirements of TE that eleganTE solves in section 3, and they are also widely-known features in modern TE systems, which are not new insights. The three extension modules of ns-3 seem to be the new features in eleganTE compared to other RL-based TE works, but these features are only used to provide a realistic network environment, and they are irrelevant to the TE solution itself.\n\n2. The motivation of the proposed methods is unclear. In section 4, the authors mention eleganTE uses MDP to formulate TE, but do not describe what this new formulation is and why it is superior to existing TE formulation ways. In addition, the time-slicing method that the authors proposed is also common in TE systems. Also, when the authors introduce SwarMDP to the framework, they do not mention the structure and advantages of SwarMDP, and the reason why it is superior to the existing methods.\n\n3. Lack of comparison with the state-of-the-art RL-based TE works. The authors only compare eleganTE with the most naive TE methods, such as OSPF and EIGRP. As the authors have mentioned, there are a lot of recent RL-based TE works that have good performance, and authors need to compare them with these works to make the proposed framework more convincing.\n\n4. Lack of exploration of common TE objectives. The TE objective explored in this work is the packet delay and packet drop ratio. There are more common TE objectives in modern TE systems, such as maximum link utilization (MLU) and throughput, and the authors need to add these evaluations."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. My first question is the novelty of the authors' work and what new contributions have been made to the RL-based TE. The authors claim that they propose a new open-source framework for RL-based TE, but the method is similar to most of the previous RL-based TE works, which use RL learning agents to make TE decisions and use network simulators (such as ns-3) to provide network environment. The three custom ns-3 modules seem different from common RL-based TE works, but in the evaluations, the authors do not show the superiority of these modules regarding solving RL-based TE.\n\n2. In the abstract and the section of TE requirements (section 3), the authors aim to solve the challenges in networks with changing states, but this topic and the proposed challenges seem to be well solved by existing RL-based TE works. So the authors may need to gain new insights and propose relevant inspiring solutions.\n\n3. I am also very confused about the formulation of the RL-based TE algorithm itself. First, the authors propose a new formulation for TE, named Markov Decision Process, without describing its detail and explaining why it is superior to existing TE formulations. Also, the advantages of SwarMDP over other RL algorithms are not explained in detail.\n\n4. In the evaluations, I think the authors mainly need to compare other state-of-the-art RL algorithms or compare the realistic TE results with and without using the proposed framework, but they both lack in the authors' paper. Instead, the authors compare naive OSPF and state the proposed framework can outperform OSPF both in the abstract and conclusion. In addition, when it comes to the traditional TE method, MPLS methods seem to be superior to naive OSPF, the authors should also compare with it if they mainly want to compare traditional methods.\n\n5. The last issue I want to mention is similar to what I have stated in the Weaknesses part, that is, minimizing MLU and maximizing throughput are more common TE objectives in modern systems. The authors may also need to evaluate these objectives."

The proposed framework can be of high value to researchers working in the intersection of ML and networking.\n2. The proposed framework can generate a variety of random network topologies (BA, ER model and WS). Furthermore, it uses the gravity model for the traffic matrix, together with small random perturbations to cover a variety of traffic dynamics.\n3.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I have various concerns about the current paper.\n1. The extensive experiments conducted by the authors seem to universally suggest that the relatively simple shortest-path-based protocols OSPF and EIGRP generally outperform MLP and GNN, and usually by large margins. The authors claim that in some cases the RL-based methods can outperform the standard protocols; as an example, they mention the predef4s topology in Figure 4. However, even though the packet delay is indeed slightly lower for MLP in Figure 4, the drop ratio is visibly higher, effectively canceling out the packet delay benefit. Results do not look promising at all for random topologies, see, e.g., Figure 6, where the max delay as well as the drop ratio for GNN can be particularly high.\n2. To me, the experimental evaluation fails to show how RL-based routing optimization makes sense in the first place. There is not a single setting, where MLP or GNN clearly beat the standard protocols in terms of both metrics. This inevitably casts doubt on the necessity of the framework. Is it for example possible that in practice shortest-path algorithms such as OSFP can easily adjust to the changing traffic by simply updating the shortest path based on the observed congestion, delays etc.? Demands contain a strong stochastic component, so is it possible that simply reacting to the changing network condition via the standard protocols is as effective (if not more effective) as complex and harder to deploy ML-based techniques? I do not think that the current work provides any encouraging answer (in favor of ML-based approaches) in this direction.\n3. I am not sure that formulating routing optimization as a swarm RL problem is well justified. SwarmMDP typically assumes a swarm of homogenous collaborating agents. But is this assumption true in flow networks? One major concern is that for the relatively small network topologies (e.g., with 3-10 nodes) that the authors have experimented with, nodes may be better modeled as heterogeneous (unless the network topology is fully symmetric, as in the complete graph). For instance, a high-degree node is expected to behave very differently compared to a peripheral node. Using GNNs makes perfect sense, but the swarm assumption seems harder to justify in tis context.\n4. The problem may be better modeled as a multi-objective RL problem, if we are interested in multiple metrics, e.g., packet delay and drop ratio. The authors employ a scalarized reward, but this seems quite ad-hoc. In Appendix B.4, for example, the authors mention that they set the reward scaling factors to specific constants, but it is not clear why that choice makes sense. Furthermore, in the ablation study in Appendix D.2, results are reported on a single network topology (predef5). This is not enough evidence to draw the conclusion that the reward function in the main text is generally better than the other reward functions. There may in principle be topologies where some of the other reward functions can achieve superior performance (with a good hyperparameter search).\n5. It seems that no real network topologies are used. Furthermore, the random topologies have up to 50 nodes. I am not clear whether this is in accordance with the desideratum of scalability, or whether the framework should be assessed on even larger topologies for this purpose."

If not, what does that suggest for the proposed framework but also for the necessity of RL-based routing optimization for communication networks?\n2. Is SwarmMDP a meaningful approach, especially in the small network regime where nodes behave very differently (asymmetrically), depending on their position in the graph?\n3. Would multi-objective RL make more sense? Can we be confident that the used hyperparameters and that the scalarized reward function in the main text are indeed the right choice for a wide range of networks? What about hyperparameter sensitivity?\n4. Are the pre-defined topologies from real networks? If yes, maybe it would make sense to assess the framework on bigger real networks?\n5. GNN seems to always suffer from bad performance. I am wondering if this contradicts the claim that the GNN has the advantage over the MLP that it can generalize to unseen topologies. In principle this may be true, but the results do not look encouraging."

                "value": "The paper proposes a new benchmark for evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) methods for traffic engineering in computer networks. The key ideas and contributions are:\n1.\tFraming distributed traffic engineering as a Swarm Markov Decision Process (SwarMDP) where nodes collaborate to optimize network performance. This allows RL agents to generalize to new topologies.\n2.\tIntroducing eleganTE, a framework for training and evaluating RL agents for traffic engineering using the ns-3 network simulator. The framework includes configurable topology and traffic generation, and interfaces for training RL agents.\n3.\tEvaluating common heuristics like OSPF and EIGRP routing as baselines, and comparing them to learned policies including MLP and graph neural network (GNN) architectures."

                "value": "1.\tThe SwarMDP formulation described in section 4 provides a way to train policies that can generalize across network topologies, an important capability highlighted in Section 3. \n2.\tEleganTE in Section 5 enables training agents using a configurable network simulator, facilitating repeatable experiments."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1.\tThe SwarMDP formulation in Section 4 lacks details on handling heterogeneous action spaces and scaling to large network sizes.\n2.\tThe eleganTE framework description in Section 5 needs specifics on the implementation, particularly how network state information is extracted into the monitoring graph representation.\n3.\tExperiments only evaluate small networks of up to 50 nodes in Section 7. Testing generalization performance to 500+ node networks is needed.\n4.\tThe GNN agent in Section 7.2 shows high variance in some experiments, indicating instability issues."
