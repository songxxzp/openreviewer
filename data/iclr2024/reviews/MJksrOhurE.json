                "value": "This paper proposes a novel time series forecasting method, called CARD. Compared with previous works, CARD builds an effective transformer to employ cross-channel information. CARD utilizes attention over tokens and attention over channels to robustly align the information among different channels. Furthermore, the token blend module introduces multi-scaling structural information. To bolster the model\u2019s ability to concentrate on forecasting for the near future, this paper develops a robust signal decay-based loss function. The comprehensive experiments demonstrated the superiority of CARD for long-term forecasting, short-term forecasting, and other prediction tasks."

It acknowledges the success of transformer models in this field, particularly due to the channel-independent (CI) strategy that improves training robustness. However, the CI approach overlooks the correlation among different channels, limiting the model's forecasting capacity. To address this limitation, CARD incorporates a channel-aligned attention structure to capture temporal correlations among signals and dynamical dependencies among multiple variables over time. Additionally, a token blend module is introduced to efficiently utilize multi-scale knowledge by generating tokens with different resolutions. The authors also present a robust loss function that considers prediction uncertainties to mitigate overfitting. Experimental evaluations on various long-term and short-term forecasting datasets demonstrate that CARD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in time series forecasting. The article concludes by discussing related work, presenting the detailed model architecture, describing the loss function design, and providing the results of numerical experiments and further analysis."

The input length for PatchTST/42 is 336, and for PatchTST/64 it is 512. I am curious whether CARD can outperform PatchTST if the authors use the same input length. If you aim to validate your experimental settings, you should use the official code of the SoTA model and adjust the parameters to ensure a fair comparison.\n\n2. Channel independence introduces a significant computational overhead. To mitigate this issue, the authors employ dynamic projection (DP) to project head dimensions from d_head to a fixed $r$ with $r \u226a C$. They demonstrate through ablation experiments involving projected dimensions of 1, 8, and 16 on ETT datasets that DP does not compromise forecasting accuracy. However, it's worth noting that ETT datasets only consist of 7 channels, which may not be sufficient to draw a definitive conclusion. Therefore, it remains unclear how this technique would perform in datasets with a larger number of variables, such as Traffic (862) or ECL (321).\n\n3. In ablation experiments, our primary focus is on evaluating the effectiveness of the new design between CARD and PatchTST. Instead of solely changing parameters, we aim to demonstrate the method's rationality and validity with greater certainty through more detailed ablation studies.\n\n4. In experiments with less training data, using only 70% of the training data samples compared to the standard training setting for long-term forecasting may not be sufficient."
