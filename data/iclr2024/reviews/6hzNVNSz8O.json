                "value": "This paper proposes an exponentially smoothed Armijo condition to improve the stability of line-search algorithms for finding the step size of Adam. Specifically, it builds upon the preconditioned gradient search condition proposed by Vaswani et al. [2], and applies exponential moving averages to both sides of the condition to improve the stability and robustness of the found step size to mini-batch noises and random parameter initializations. Experiments are performed on both image and NLP tasks to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In fact, the sudden drop may happen across several iterations caused by mini-batch noises when the gradient norm becomes small. The authors may want to comment more on this."

                "value": "I do not see much benefit of the proposed method over the current lr schedule. As a practitioner, I do not have a strong motivation to use the proposed method after reading the paper. The reasons are as follows:\n\n1. **Fine-tuning tasks are too simple, not convincing.**  Most NLP experiments are based on small fine-tuning datasets and small models.  These tasks are simple for optimization and insensitive to LR choices.  I am hoping to see more challenging tasks such as pretraining tasks for larger models on larger datasets, which rely much heavier on a good lr choice than the fine-tuning tasks shown in the script. \n2.  **Unsatisfactory performance.**   The performance on imagenet tasks is unsatisfactory. Unclear performance on pretraining tasks on larger datasets and larger models.\n3. **Did not save the number of hyperparameters.**  The proposed method has many hyperparameters. For instance, there are at least three hyperparameters in section 2.1 (including initial lr,  c, delta, b ), beta3 in section 3.1, and two betas in section 3.4.  As such, the proposed method does not save much trouble in the current lr schedule. The title \"No learning rate needed\" is overclaimed, as well.\n4. **More runing time**.  Backtracking methods require additional forward and backward passing of neural nets, which could be the major computational bottleneck when the model size grows. Though the authors claim they only require 3% additional running time over standard training,  there is no real evidence to support this claim.  I would suggest the authors report the wall-clock running time and compare it to that of standard training. Further, as the model size grows, the additional forward & backward passing would require much more running time as claimed 3%. \n\n\n\nIn summary, I don't see the motivation to replace the current lr schedule with the proposed method."
