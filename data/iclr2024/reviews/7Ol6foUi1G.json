                "value": "The paper introduces the Data-independent Module-Aware Pruning (DIMAP) for hierarchical vision transformers (ViTs). Instead of relying on magnitude values like traditional pruning techniques, DIMAP evaluates \"local\" attention weights in hierarchical ViTs by their impact on information distortion. By examining weight distribution at different hierarchical levels, DIMAP offers an alternative to magnitude-based methods. Tests on Swin Transformers highlight its efficiency, with a small decrease in top-5 accuracy and notable reductions in FLOPs and parameters."

Instead of the prevalent focus on weight magnitudes, DIMAP evaluates attention weights based on their effect on information distortion, setting it apart from standard methods.\n\n2. The approach is grounded in solid theory, with mathematical models reflecting a comprehensive grasp of the issue. The choice to use distortion analysis as a measure of weight significance stands out.\n\n3. The paper's organization is logical, detailing the obstacles and answers related to pruning hierarchical ViTs. Its equations, coupled with their explanations, offer transparency and ease of understanding for readers.\n\n4. Given the rising importance of hierarchical ViTs in computer vision, the paper's relevance is significant. Efficient pruning is vital for these transformers in limited-resource scenarios. DIMAP, focusing on maintaining crucial attributes while cutting down computations, meets a current community demand."
