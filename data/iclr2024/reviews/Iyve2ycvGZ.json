For method Sec.3.3, the authors did not provide enough details about how to address the dynamic programming (DP) problem in practice. From the experiments, different datasets should share different sampling schedules. Moreover, how many samples are used to calculate the optimal scheduler? What will the optimal scheduler be like, if using different initial noises? The analysis of the generalization of the optimal scheduler selected by DP is very important.\n3. Missing necessary discussions about diffusion sampling schedules in related works (such as [1]). Moreover, the related works are too simple, and only include some matching-flow methods.\n3. Insufficient qualitative comparisons: the authors only provide qualitative comparisons of human faces.\n4. No details about the velocity network re-alignment training are provided.\n\n[1] Karras T, Aittala M, Aila T, et al. Elucidating the design space of diffusion-based generative models[J].
