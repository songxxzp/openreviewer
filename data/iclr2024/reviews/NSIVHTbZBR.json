The proposed method was combined with copaint and compared with existing methods. The LPIPS value got slightly improved on three commonly used datasets: CelebA-HQ, ImageNet, LSUN-Bedroom. Visual examples were presented and computing cost was discussed."

As a result, TPM is only required in the first \u223c20% denoising steps\".
