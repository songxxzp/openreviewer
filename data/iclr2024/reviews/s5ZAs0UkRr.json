This is done through first estimating a latent code of the distorted image and then resampling a new sample starting from that latent code. The method is simple. The main issue is that the presentation is cumbersome. \n\nI have the following questions/comments:\n1.  **Algorithm 1**. This is the core of the method. It's unclear what does it mean  ODE_SOLVER( . ). Is this running one step of DDIM Eq(9)? This is used twice in the algorithm. The rationale of the algorithm is not clear or explained.\n\n2. **Results of the base methods are blurry**. So this method doesn't seem to be doing a good job. Better results are obtained when plugging the method with another prior (CodeFormer, GFPGAN, etc). So in the end, it's more like with this ODEdit you can get a blurry reconstruction (Average) and then from there another prior is enforced to get a better reconstruction. So in the end, where is the gain coming from? Also it's not clear how this method is applied in conjunction with other methods.\n\n3. **Presentation is cumbersome**. The method is presented in page 6. The first 5 pages are related to some background. However, a big part of the background is irrelevant and other relevant background (like a clean explanation of SDEdit) is not given. This leads to an unbalanced presentation that is hard to follow, and hard to fairly judge the real contributions of the paper."
