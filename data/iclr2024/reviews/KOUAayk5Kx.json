To address this issue, the authors propose a method called Orthogonal Gradient Learning (OGL) to update the weights of the current architecture in a way that they become orthogonal to the constructed gradient space. A series of experiments are conducted in this paper on multiple datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of OGL in addressing the multi-model forgetting problem."

This avoids overwriting well-trained models while training new architectures sequentially. A PCA-based projection is used to find orthogonal directions without storing all past gradient vectors. OGL is integrated into RandomNAS and GDAS one-shot NAS baselines. Experiments show OGL reduces forgetting, leading to better final architectures and stronger supernet predictive ability."
