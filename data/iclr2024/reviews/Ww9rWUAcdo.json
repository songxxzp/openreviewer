Motivated by the prior work (Ilyas et al. 2019), they theoretically demonstrate that the adversarial perturbation can be represented as a weighted combination of the natural datapoints. And the model trained on these adversarial perturbations (with incorrect labels) can efficiently learn the data features and generate well on the natural data. Specifically, they provide some theorems showing the boundary of the model learning from the purturbations is partially determined by the model learning from the natural data. Some experiments are conducted to validate their theory."

                "value": "My main concerns about this paper are:\n* In Section 4.1, the authors generate the adversarial examples according to the linear model. I understand the decision boundaries of the linear model $f^{bdy}(z)$ and the one-hidden-layer neural network are the same (Theorem 3.3). However, I don't think we can directly replace the neural work with the linear model to generate adversarial examples since adversarial examples are generated by optimizing the loss, which is different. Can the authors provide more theoretical explanations for this?\n* Although the authors claim that they focus on one-hidden-layer neural networks, they make some approximations and actually focus on linear models. So the contribution of this paper is reduced.\n\nSome minor concerns:\n* In the third paragraph of the introduction, the authors say, \"Nevertheless, neural networks can learn to accurately classify benign samples from such adversarially perturbed samples with seemingly incorrect labels\". Can you provide more explanation for this? Does it mean we can train a model that can accurately distinguish the adversarial examples from the clean sample?\n* In this work, the authors show that the model trained on adversarial perturbations with incorrect labels (i.e., $y^{adv}$) can generate well on the clean data. But as we know, traditional adversarial training is based on adversarial examples with correct labels (i.e., $y^{natural}$). So, why do these two methods both generate well on the clean data? \n* I would like to know the adversarial accuracy of the method in your experiments.\n* In Eq. (2), does $x_n$ refer to the training data $x_n$? It seems that $x_n$ here is new test data that is different from the training data $x_n$. Otherwise, the gradient calculation in Eq. (2) should be reconsidered. Please check this out.\n* The assumption in Theorem 4.2 is somewhat strong: $|\\sum\\lambda_n y_n <x_n,z>|=\\Theta(g(N,d))$ if $\\sum\\lambda_n  |<x_n,z>|=\\Theta(g(N,d))$. It is intuitive that the first term is much smaller than the second term. What would your theorem be without this assumption?\n* In Section 5.1, I have some confusion about some statements. For example, in Fig 1, the authors mentioned standard data and noisy data. But in their setting, there are two kinds of noisy data: the dataset is generated randomly and can be viewed as some noises; the adversarial perturbations are superposed on random noises. I am confused as to what \"standard data\" and \"noise\" refer to. I strongly recommend the authors make more clear clarifications in the paper.\n* As the authors claim in the experiments, there are some counterexamples. I think more discussions about these counterexamples are needed. Is it because the effect of learning from mislabeled natural data dominates the effect of learning from perturbation?\n* Since there are negative effects of learning from natural data or noises, why doesn't the learner solely learn from the perturbations?"

Normally when people consider adversarial training to gain robustness, at each iteration the adversarial training examples is generated based on the current model weight, yet in this paper, from the definition 3.2, it seems that the adversarial examples of training samples is generated beforehand and independent of the current model weight, and it\u2019s fixed during the latter training procedure. Therefore it\u2019s unclear to me whether the perturbation considered in this paper is actually adversarial or not. The author claims the motivation comes from Ilyas et a. 2019, whereas in that paper there\u2019s also a math formulation of generating the designed adversarial perturbation, which seems different from the procedure described in definition 3.2. \n\nIt seems this paper\u2019s theoretical results largely build on the result from Frei et al 2023. Yet the discussion of the existing result and the corollary is limited. It\u2019s unclear to me why corollary 3.4 can be directly derived from Theorem 3.3. Theorem 3.3 requires clean training data to be nearly orthogonal, then for corollary 3.4 you should also prove that the adversarial example is almost orthogonal. Moreover, the adversarial perturbation considered depends on the decision boundary, but it\u2019s unclear to me whether the coefficient $\\lambda$ in the decision boundary is computable. The network only considers Leaky ReLU, yet it\u2019s unclear why cannot generalize to other activation functions and what\u2019s the technical difficulty.\n\nThe statement of each theorem is not self-contented. If $R_{min}, R_{max}, p_{max}$ is used all over the place, then they should be introduced in the notation part. The explanation of each theorem and corollary is not clear. Why we require equation (3)? Any intuitive explanation or simply one requirement for the proof to go through? When N goes to infinity, equation (3) is saying $p_{max}$ is negative, which is kind of counterintuitive. Similarly, what does equation (6) hold mean intuitively?"

Is it mainly because of the orthogonality of training data so that even if the label is noisy the data is still orthogonal?\n\n2. For the discussion of theorem 4.1 ``Consistent Growth of Two Effects\u201d, it\u2019s unclear to me whether estimating the growth rate of T1, T2 by switching the absolute operator and the summation is reasonable. The magnitude could have a huge difference with proper label $y_n$, so why assume the rate of switching the operator is reasonable?\n\n3. It\u2019s unclear from a theoretical perspective in Appendix G why the standard decision boundary only depends on non-robust features as shown in equation A157.\n\n4. For Figure 2, and other figures, does the accuracy clean accuracy or adversarial robust accuracy? What\u2019s the procedure to generate adversarial perturbation?

In the abstract, the paper claims that the phenomenon \u201cneural networks trained on mislabeled samples with adversarial perturbations can generalize to natural test data\u201d is counter-intuitive.  I do not understand why this is a counter-intuitive phenomenon and how this phenomenon motivates the problem of learning from adversarial perturbations. If I understand correctly, the adversarial perturbations are generated with respect to some pre-trained neural networks and are not necessarily \u201cmislabeled\u201d (unless the perturbation size is large). In addition, the definition of mislabeled data needs to be clarified because, typically, human is considered the underlying ground truth in judging whether an input image is mislabeled. However, you use a pre-trained neural network as the reference model for defining whether an input is mislabeled. I am also confused by the statement in the introduction, \u201cA classifier, trained on natural samples with adversarial perturbations labeled by such incorrect classes, can generalize to unperturbed data,\u201d which I believe is not the key message that Ilyas et al. (2019) wants to convey. From my perspective, the learnability of adversarially perturbated natural data is because the added perturbation is not large enough to destroy the useful generalizable features of the natural data. I hope the authors can clarify my concerns in the rebuttal on why the learnability from the added adversarial perturbations is worth studying, which will largely decide my judgement on whether this paper reaches the ICLR acceptance bar or not.\n\nMoreover, the imposed assumptions of orthogonal training data and the use of geometric-inspired attacks need to be better discussed. What is the mathematical definition of orthogonal training data? I do not understand the claim that the orthogonality of training data is a common property of high-dimensional data. Does this claim hold for any high-dimensional data distribution or specific distributions? In addition, I believe geometric-inspired attacks are less commonly studied in the adversarial ML community. How will the conclusion of your theoretical findings change if the perturbations are generated by PGD attacks (Madry et al., 2018)?"

In summary, I will keep my score unchanged. I think the authors misunderstood my major concern, which has nothing to do with adversarial training or adversarial robustness. What is unconvinced from my perspective is the motivation for studying the setting of learning from adversarial perturbations. I do not find a convincing answer in the rebuttal, and I can hardly understand the benefits gained from studying this problem. The final conclusion drawn from the paper is that standard learning from adversarially perturbed inputs (with possibly incorrect labels) yields consistent predictions. Because of the assumptions on how the adversarial perturbations are generated, I am not sure if the paper's theoretical evidence is sufficient to support such general conclusion. In my opinion, the way adversarial perturbations are generated and the perturbation budget will highly affect the final conclusion."
