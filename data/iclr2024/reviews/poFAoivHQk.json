                "value": "Recent studies unveil that, much like GNNs, Transformers suffer from the over-smoothing issue, where an increase in depth does not consistently lead to enhanced performance. More disconcerting is the finding that a Transformer with a significantly deeper layer does not outperform a shallower one. Stemming from these observations, the authors interpret self-attention as a form of graph convolution. Viewing through the perspective of graph signal processing, they propose Graph Filter-based Self-Attention (GFSA), where the attention matrix is processed through a trinomial-based graph filter. The experimental results affirm that GFSA substantially elevates the performance of Transformers across various domains."

The distinction between self-attention and (directed) graph convolution lies in the requirement for the graph shift operator in (directed) graph convolution to be diagonalizable, a constraint absent in the attention matrix in self-attention. In a directed graph, each signal space -- to which each column of input features belongs -- should remain invariant to filtering [1]. In other words, the signal space housing each column of output vectors should be the same as that of the corresponding input vectors. The sole condition fulfilling this scenario is that the graph shift operator has to be diagonalizable. Hence, unless the authors can demonstrate that the attention matrix in each GFSA is diagonalizable, employing graph signal processing as the theoretical underpinning for GFSA is inappropriate.\n2. The elucidation provided on how GFSA mitigates the over-smoothing issue lacks adequacy. The authors need to furnish a more comprehensive illustration, accompanied by meticulous formulation derivations and rigorous proofs, to substantiate their claims.\n3. The time complexity of GFSA exceeds that of both single-head and multi-head self-attention. Specifically, in scenarios with a large number of tokens, the computation of $\\mathbf{A}^{2}$ will demand a substantial amount of computational resources.\n\n[1] A. Sandryhaila and J. M. F.

I am doubtful about the correctness of this equation.\n\n3. Theorem 3.1 establishes an error bound for the Taylor approximation in Eqn 5.

The claim that \u201c(A-bar^2 \u2212 A-bar) captures the difference between 2-hop and 1-hop neighborhood information\u201d and \u201cacts as a filter that emphasizes changes or variations in a local structure\u201d is evidenceless. Graph neural networks (GNNs) typically require multiple hops to aggregate non-local information from distant neighbors, whereas self-attention allows one to attend all tokens simultaneously. This raises the question of why self-attention would need (A-bar^2 - A-bar).\n\n2. When explaining over-smoothing problem in transformers, the authors claim: \u201cThis problem is obvious to understand since Transformers\u2019 aggregation methods for value vectors are simply weighted averages\u201d. This argument is weak and vague. \n\n3. The experimental results display inconsistencies. It is challenging to find the 3.3% improvement mentioned in the introduction for the image classification task, as it is not evident in Figure 1 and Table 3. Likewise, the claim of a 1.63% improvement for DeiT-S + GFSA over DeiT-S does not correspond with the results presented in Table 3. Furthermore, the alleged 6.23% improvement in the natural language understanding task cannot be observed when comparing Figure 1 and Table 5.\n\nIn summary, I recommend rejecting the paper for two primary reasons. First, the paper's novelty and contribution are lacking. The concept of self-attention as a weighted graph has already been discussed in prior works [1, 2, 3, 4]. Although the authors introduce the idea of viewing self-attention as a graph filter, they fail to provide a solid explanation for how this perspective addresses the issue of over-smoothing in Transformers. Second, the paper's theoretical foundation is weak, and it lacks evidence to explain why Transformers experience over-smoothing within their graph-based framework and how their proposed models effectively resolve this problem. Lastly, I find that the main arguments presented in the paper are not convincing.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Han Shi, Jiahui Gao, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang, Zhenguo Li, Lingpeng Kong, Stephen Lee, and James T Kwok.
