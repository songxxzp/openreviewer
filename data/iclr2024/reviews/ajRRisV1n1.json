                "value": "This paper studies a variant of the group testing problem, where within a universe $N$ of $n$ elements there is an unknown \u201chidden\u201d set $K$ of $k$ elements, and the goal is to recover the hidden set using queries. In the variant studied here, a query $Q$\n is simply a subset of the universe, and it returns the following. If $|Q \\cap K| = 1$ then the (single) element at the intersection is being returned. Otherwise, nothing is returned. (Notably, the most common variant of group testing is one where if $|Q \\cap K| \\geq 1$ then \u201cyes\u201d is returned, and otherwise \u201cno\u201d.)\n\nThe authors consider two novel variant of interest under the above query model. The first variant is a so called \u201clocal\u201d one, where the goal is that for each element $x \\in N \\setminus K$ (i.e., each element of the universe not from the chosen set), and each $y \\in K$, there will be at least one query containing both $x$ and $y$ (and no other element from $K$, as per our query model). The second model is a local one with an added constraint, where we want the above query to not only contain $x$ and $y$, but also be free of a pre-determined (but unknown) forbidden set of elements.\n\nThe main result is an explicit construction of a solution to these group testing problems for both of the above models. Both results have query complexity cubic in $k$, which is shown to be tight up to lower order terms, and for the second, \u201clocal avoiding\u201d model the dependence in $\\ell$ is polynomial (but the results are not tight). Technically, the construction is algebraic and seems to rely on properties of polynomial of low degree over finite fields. The lower bound follows by a simple recursive interpretation of the definition of the local model. One interesting artifact of the results is a separation between these the query complexity of these local models and the complexity of the classical model, where we only need to uncover the hidden set \u201ccentrally\u201d."

The second more restrictive variant requires the avoidance of a set of given forbidden clusters in queries.\nFor both problems the existence of shorter protocols is known, however no construction exists and the contribution of this manuscript is to provide the first constructive shorter-than-trivial protocols. These protocols are longer by a polylogarithmic factor in the size of the universe.\nIn addition these protocols are complemented by lower bounds which are quite close to those achieved by the previously known non-constructed protocols."

In the local algorithm they introduce, they assume that each hidden element is \"autonomous\", meaning it can analyze the feedback itself for only the queries where this element is a part of.

The sentences are sometimes unnecessarily complicated and/or too long, which makes it harder to understand the ideas presented in the paper.

The existing citations are not inside parentheses which interrupts the flow of the text for the readers.\n\n- There is no need to capitalize Machine Learning in the first paragraph of the introduction.\n\n- As far as I checked, the c.f. usage is wrong throughout the paper (https://blog.apastyle.org/files/apa-latin-abbreviations-table-2.pdf). This document says it is used to provide contrasting information but I observed that it is probably used instead of i.e. or e.g. in this paper.\n\n- This sentence in the introduction needs citations: \"Originally GT was applied for identifying infected individuals in large populations using pooled tests...\"\n\n- The words in the parentheses can be added to this sentence: \"More information, applications and links could be found in the seminal book (of) Du et al. (2000) and recent literature (by) Klonowski et al. (2022); Kowalski & Pajak (2022b).\"\n\n- LocAS is mentioned in the footnote of page 3 before it has been introduced in the main body of the text. \n\n- The problem is not motivated enough beyond the group testing setting.\n\n- The frequent use of the dash (-) gives an informal tone to the paper. \n\n- \"Intuitively, having elements from other clusters in the query may negatively influence, or even clash, the learning process within a given cluster \u2013 hence, the goal is to do local learning of k hidden elements within the cluster and simultaneously avoiding the other \u2113 \u201cbad\u201d clusters.\": No need for a comma after the clash in this sentence. (Page 3)\n\n- Typo in \"qyery\". (Page 5)\n\n- Did you mean existing result instead of existential result on Page 7? If not, what is an existential result?\n\n- Typo in \"guarantying\". (Page 9)\n\n- The beeping feedback mention on Section 5.2 needs citations.\n\nNote: I am aware that almost all of the remarks I make under weaknesses related to language and grammar concerns. I am also ware that some of them are easily fixable. I do not want to discriminate against anybody based on their linguistic abilities. My main problem here is that, when the frequency of such mistakes increase, it makes it harder to focus on the actual contents of the paper. Plus, it signals me that the sufficient effort to express the novelty of the paper clearly and efficiently has not been made. I strongly believe that expressing our ideas clearly is a skill we all should aim to advance ourselves as researchers."

(I understand this is being explained on Section 5.3 at the very end but maybe a very brief explanation towards the beginning would have helped the reader better.)\n\n- Are there another applications where learning the hidden set would be useful other than the group testing setting?\n\n- What does \"whichever are relevant\" in the following sentence mean?: We say that Q is constructible in polynomial time if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm, that given parameters n, k, \u2113 (whichever are relevant) outputs an appropriate sequence of queries satisfying the requirements.\"\n\n- What are existential upper bounds?"
