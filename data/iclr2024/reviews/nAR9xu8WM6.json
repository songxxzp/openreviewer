                "value": "- There are several factually inappropriate usages of the notion of DP. DP is not \"incorporated\" in a model or multimodality (as the authors mention in different ways a few times throughout the paper), DP is a property of a randomised algorithm (in this context, the training algorithm that produces the distribution of models, not the model). \n- Proposition 3.1 is a trivial consequence of the basic theorems of DP, and Algorithm 1 is a simple modification of DP-SGD (that is already available in standard DP-training libraries). The only interesting aspect is adapting the training procedure to contrastive learning, which is trivial. Therefore the novelty of these components of the paper is negligible.\n- It is unclear why the zero-shot prediction of CLIP is not used as a baseline (as it would be equivalent to epsilon = 0). Furthermore, the authors are neglecting parameter efficient fine-tuning baselines, for instance like [1]. The description of the baselines is lacking and quite confusing: it's not clear why the authors have two DP-SGD baselines, and what they're exactly updating during training.\n- The experimental analysis focuses exclusively on known computer vision datasets that do not differ from the training distribution of CLIP. It would be useful if following the suggestions of [2,3] the authors could present results in settings with low data regimes and with significant distribution shift with respect to the pre-training set, which represents a more realistic application setting.  Furthermore, the authors deliberately avoid settings where DP is known to be hard due to the relatively low amount of training data per class (e.g. CIFAR-100/ImageNet).\n- Not accounting for the privacy loss incurred in tuning the hyperparameters is a problem. Simply because baselines have done that, it doesn't justify the authors from reporting inflated numbers. I would recommend the authors to at least assume the availability of some public data that is kept out of training and evaluations and to run all the baselines fairly in this setting. \n- BLIP is definitely no more state-of-the-art as the authors claim. Several more sophisticated VLMs have been released since BLIP, e.g. LLaVa 1.5. \n- There are several grammatical errors and typos, and the overall presentation is a bit poor. Sections 5 onwards feel disconnected from the rest of the work. \n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05679.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06470.pdf\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03962"

                "value": "I found the experimental section to be very problematic. Specifically, \n- Framing the algorithm as \"DP-CLIP\" is very misleading. You didn't train a CLIP model from scratch using DP-SGD, but rather continue pretraining a **well-trained** model in a privacy-preserving manner. This is not mentioned in the abstract, and is not made clear until the experimental section. As a side note, the comparison with Yu et al. (2023) is unfair: 1) there are obviously no \"two stages\" in your algorithm since you only performed continued pretraining; 2) Yu et al. (2023) only pretrained on synthesized textures to speedup the DP training process, while the starting point of your DP training is already a very strong model.      \n- The classification tasks are too simple given the power of the pretrained model. It might not be necessary at all to perform private continued pretraining; plus I found pretraining on datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 to be super weird. Two critical baselines are currently missing: the accuracy of the vanilla CLIP model (without continued pretraining), and the accuracy of $\\varepsilon=\\infty$ (non-private continued pretraining). \n- The comparison with other baselines in Section 4.2 is arbitrary and careless. The authors didn't evaluate the same set of methods on all datasets, and didn't report whether the results for other algorithms are based on their own implementation or directly copied from prior works. The accuracy of DP-Sinkhorn on Fashion-MNIST does not match the one reported in the original paper. It is also unclear whether these algorithms are indeed the state-of-the-art methods in image classification. Finally, DP-Sinkhorn is not even a DP image classification method -- while it is capable of performing such task, it is essentially an algorithm of DP data synthesis (take a look at [1] if you are not familiar with this concept). It is unbelievable that the authors chose this method for comparison.\n- I didn't buy the results from Section 4.3; particularly, I have never seen using $\\varepsilon = 1e-4$ in the privacy literature, and it is hard to believe that such privacy budget could still lead to a meaningful model (in the extreme case $\\varepsilon=0$, the model will become completely random). On the other hand, the authors seemed to suggest that the model's performance is mostly unaffected even in this extreme case. I insist: 1) report the $\\sigma$ (the noise multiplier), and check the SNR to see whether the results make sense; 2) use $\\varepsilon=1e-8$ and see whether the results are still consistent; 3) use the vanilla CLIP model (without any further continued pre-training) and see whether the results are already very good. Other issues in this section: 1) there is no description of the non-private model, I have completely no idea what \"IBM Research AI\" is and whether the comparison with DP-BLIP makes sense at all; 2) it is unclear why a baseline of non-private BLIP is missing.  \n\nMinor:\n- The experiments should be running over multiple random seeds, and please include the standard deviations in the tables\n- The dataset paragraph should be revised. The descriptions of the datasets are way too long yet important details are missing (e.g., the dimensionality of each dataset). The metrics used in image captioning are not explained. \n- \"TensorFlow Privacy\": which privacy accountant did you use exactly? As a side note, RDP and PRV accountant are the go-to choices nowadays. \n- The paragraph below Table 2: \"which is not present for DP-SGD\" -- please note that the pretraining and extra caption data are not used in other baseline methods as well\n- Various grammatical issues, included but not limited to: \"while a smaller or equal $\\varepsilon$\" -> \"with a smaller or equal $\\varepsilon$\"; \"allow our private approach to achieving\" -> \"to achieve\"; \"Apart from their work\" -- I don't understand what you meant here; \"requires... should be indistinguishable\" --> \"to be indistinguishable\". Please do a professional proofreading before submitting your work. \n\nIn light of the major issues in the experimental section, this paper is clearly below the bar of ICLR and I will strive for a rejection. \n\nReference\n\n[1] Hu et al. \"SoK: Privacy-Preserving Data Synthesis.\" 2024 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP).
