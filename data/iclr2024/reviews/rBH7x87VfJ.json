I would be interested to see empirical tests validating the theory: i.e., actually do $n$ random lifts, train via sgd, and see what percent of the time it converges.\n\n2. I have reservations about assumption A1. The set $A_{s,g}(\\kappa, \\epsilon)$ echoes ideas from neural tangent kernel approximation -- as the authors note, it includes not only weights which are close to $f^*$, but also weights which can be made close to $f^*$ by moving a little bit $u$ in the tangent approximation to the network. The NTK argument justifies this by showing that, under some random initialization, networks are close to their linear approximation as their width goes to infinity. Assumption 1 essentially starts by assuming that the tangent assumption is reasonable, and then states a lower bound on the size of the set of weights that can be made close to $f^*$ by moving in the tangent plane. So in effect they seem to be _assuming_ what NTK analyses _concludes_ from infinite-width scaling. In that light, the fact that this paper claims convergence guarantees for finite-width networks does not seem that impressive.\n\nI am happy to raise my score if either of the above points are adequately addressed, as I actually found the paper quite interesting. I was originally inclined to give a stronger recommendation but my understanding on (2) seems to be a serious limitation.\n\nSmall remark / suggestion: some sentences are somewhat difficult to parse due to length, especially in the intro. For example: \"Distinct from the fixed-space global optimality of non-convex optimization, this new form of convergence, and the techniques introduced to prove such convergence, pave the way for a usable deep learning convergence theory in the near future, without overparameterization assumptions relating the number of parameters and training samples\""

I didn't follow the sentence: \"\"Lastly, if there are many such subnetworks, then a small modification of parameters cannot substantially modify them all if the large network is large enough.\"\n\nAs I am not familiar with the field I cannot give a confident review, although I hope the authors will be able to atleast dispell my concerns about weakness 2 above."

I'd suggest changing it to \"for some parameter $\\theta^*$\".\n* It is not clear why a long list of citations from approximation theory (page 1) is given since the paper studies convergence. \n* In many places, claims are unjustified. For example, 'the class of neural networks that can be described .. more expressive than Tensor Programs\". Why is that so? It would be OK not to explain this if it was a trivial statement.\n* Informal text: \"full-support type assumption\" on page 2. \n* It is not clear to me how Theorem 2.1 helps the paper. As the authors say, it is a slight extension of Robin et al. 2022 with a very similar proof technique. It would help to add an intuitive explanation of how this result will be used in the paper. \n* I have not seen how the class of architectures introduced here includes/related to convolutional neural networks. \n* The definition of the random sparse lifts (which is in the title of the paper) comes on the last page (Def 4.2). This is very unusual and it makes it nearly impossible to follow up with the text until the last page. I'd kindly suggest arranging the text in the following order: (i) introduce the definitions (only those elements needed for the main theorem) (ii) main theorem (Theorem 4.3) (iii) discuss generalizations to other architectures such as transformers."

The paper establishes global convergence of gradient flow (in a particular mode of convergence that exists in literature) for a large class of universal approximators and establishes that the learning number (smallest width sizes such that the network can learn) is not too large. This is applicable to a wide range of feedforward architectures, including those with skip connections or attention/self-attention.\n\nThe random sparse lift construction is interesting in that it is explicit and only requires a low-loss starting architecture (that can be obtained from experiments).
