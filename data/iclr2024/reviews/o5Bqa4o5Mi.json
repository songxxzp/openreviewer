This relationship could be arbitrarily bad; no matter how many evaluations you do, the underlying feature may not provide a reasonable signal that relates to the ground truth.\n- Can I assume that correlation means relative performance (i.e.,  the ordering of values between the prediction and ground are the same), while NMAE is absolute performance (i.e., the predicted and ground values are exactly the same)?\n- What is significant of NMAE? The performance values of Table-1 and Table-2 imply that correlation indicates regret. This means that representations with low regret have a high correlation, but NMAE does not have a relationship to regret.\n- Why is action representation the only baseline applicable baseline? The underlying data has states and actions. Would it be unfair to condition a baseline on both state-action pairs?\n- The discussion from (i), (ii), and (iii) in the results section is confusing. In results (ii), the authors raise the point that NMAE is better, but in (iii), the authors raise the point that their approach is better in regret.
