By treating each bias configuration as a node, and the shared input feature vector for the edges, the relevance model is identifiable if and only if the graph is connected. Then two methods are proposed to try to address the issues (making the graph connected). Experiments are conducted on two synthetic datasets and an offline dataset, where it shows that using the two methods to change data can improve the performance of a naive baseline."

                "value": "Overall the paper is not satisfactory in term of theories or experiments.\n\nThough the theorems look interesting at first glance, the reviewer feels they are generally not very solid or practical after a closer look at them. A major issue is the reviewer feels the submission has self-contradictions in several places. \n\nSo there are two scenarios in practice: 1) there are a lot of data, and the bias factor space is small. This is the a common case in practice and people are just fine without worrying about identifiability. The analysis and methods in this paper mostly do not apply since the graph is small and likely connected. 2) There are a lot of bias factors and the graph is more likely to be not connected. The paper mainly argues about this scenario. So far so good and it is ok to focus on 2).\n\nHowever, by closing look at each theorem, all of them are questionable and some look contradictory to the focus/motivation:\n\nTheorem1: while the trend of using more bias factors is the trend is debatable (especially given existing work showing the coupling / confounding effect), the trend to enrich x is clear. Many real-world applications have personalized feature vectors - then the graph is not likely to be connected even with a small number of bias factors. The paper does not concern this perspective, also, people are fine working with ULTR with such datasets. This questions the value of the proposed framework - one should also note that the condition is only a sufficient condition. \n\nTheorem 2: The assumptions are too strong to make meaningful value from this theorem. The reviewer understands this is to show a simplified \u201cestimate\u201d, but still the value is quite limited for this highly practical field.\n\nTheorem 3: There\u2019s self-contradiction with the motivation of the paper. As discussed, the paper mainly concerns large bias factor space. However, this theorem assumes that each (input feature , bias factor) pair need to sample N observations from a Bernoulli distribution, and the theorem is based on \u201cN is sufficiently large\u201d. How can this be meaningful under the scenario the paper is concerned with?\n\nTheorem 4: The error bound is only shown to merge two subgraphs. Again, the paper is concerned with large bias factor space and the number of subgraphs could be be high - what is the error bound for the entire merge process? Will the errors propagate to meaningless values? Showing error bound only for merging two subgraphs looks quite limited.\n\nThere are also several places in the paper that also look contradictory, e.g. when it argues about the benefit of node intervention, \u201cIt should be noted that K is typically smaller the the number of positions (assuming that positions are the sole bias factor)\u201d - the reviewer is confused about such claims. If the paper is concerned with such scenario, then there\u2019s probably no need to worry about the identifiability issue.\n\nOn the experiments part, the evaluation is weak. The major issue is, the proposed methods are only shown to improve the very basic baseline. The authors argue that the methods are agnostic to the actual algorithm and \u201captly represents the current research\u201d - the reviewer strongly disagrees - to show the proposed method is really meaningful,  it needs to show that they can help more sensible baselines. For example, will they help state-of-the-art ULTR methods? If not, why would people care? This is important since the proposed two methods have clear caveats (the node intervention method is not very practical, the node merging method is likely to introduce errors)."

Thus, the rationality of these two proposed algorithms (node intervention and node merging) becomes critical. Regrettably, Theorems 3 and 4 are slightly weak, which seriously undermines the contribution of this paper."

The work also allows for more explainability in the field of ULTR and thus simplifies difficult questions.\n\nS2: This paper proposes two novel methods, node intervention and node merging, to bridge the \u201cunidentifiability gap\u201d by utilizing the graph properties.

However, how is it guaranteed that the features reflect their true similarity? For example, we may use document rank as a bias factor when only considering the position bias. But it turns out that the user may notice the documents in the order of: the first several documents (since they\u2019re most noticeable), the last several documents on this page (since users may scroll down), and then documents in the middle. In the more complex settings of several factors, it\u2019s even less obvious which nodes are similar to each other. Is it possible to make the features not deterministic but rather learned throughout multi-task learning?\n\nQ3: In the application of the method, the dataset is mostly online and continuously taking in new data points. How does the proposed method handle the updates efficiently? For example, if two nodes (bias factors) with similar features are already merged but the new datapoints from the user creates an edge between them, is there a way to efficiently deal with this?"
