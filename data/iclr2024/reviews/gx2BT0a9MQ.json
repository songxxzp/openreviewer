Quantized Distributed Training of Large Models with Convergence Guarantees. ICML 2023). I understand that QSDP was officially published on ICML not very long ago and we reviewers should not take the release date on arxiv as a reason to reject this paper. However, this is a delicate situation for me and I guess we will need the AC to judge. \nFor now, I still need the authors to give a detailed comparison between QSDP and zero++, which will help a lot for my paper review."

What are the specific quantization algorithm used in the experiments?\n\n2. In experiments, some details are missing. For example, in Section 4.3 \"Pretraining\" (or Figure 9), it is mentioned that 8-bit or 6-bit quantization is used. However, it is unknown whether is 8-bit for both parameters and gradients? or 8-bit for parameters and fp16 for gradients? or fp16 for parameters and 8-bit for gradients? I strongly recommend the authors to specify what (parameter or gradient) is quantized wherever quantization/precision configuration is mentioned.\n\n3. In the experiments,  Section 4.3 \"Fine-tuning\" (or Table 2), it is mentioned that \"with ZeRO++ using FP6, INT4, and INT2 precision for qwZ and INT-8 for qgZ ...\" I wonder why not also conduct some experiments of lower precision (int4, int2) on qgZ? Also, is there any ablation experiments on other configurations, such as int4 qwZ + fp16 qgZ?\n\nBTW, there is \"FP6\" in Section 4.3 (see the sentence I quoted above), is it a typo and the authors actually mean \"FP16\" here?\n\n4. What's the difference between Zero++ and QSDP (in system design), except for the hierarchical partitioning in Zero++ (hpZ)?"

                "value": "1.\tIn my opinion, the main insufficient of this paper is short of novelty. In fact, this paper is more like a technical report instead of an academic paper. The techniques of quantization and organizing the communication into a new topology are not new ideas. However, considering the overlap realization and trade-off between memory and communication are difficult and expensive, this paper is still significant for LLM community.\n\n2.\tAnother problem is that this paper is lack of specific introduction to used quantization techniques and corresponding theoretical analysis. For example, how the quantization error affects the convergence rate and whether the error-feedback technique works."
