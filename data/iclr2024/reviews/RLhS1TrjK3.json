This needs to be considered.\n+ Although the paper added rich semantic information to the dataset, its detection performance was not very good. Existing unsupervised defect detection methods have already surpassed an AUPR score of 0.7 at the pixel level, which means that existing defect detection methods can achieve an IoU of over 70 without using defect data.

Their main weakness is the inability to determine the type of defect, which may be a problem that the paper can solve. However, the paper may need to do some additional work beyond the data to design a solution for this problem."

This is quite important for practical industrial manufacturing. \n\n2. The data generation approach, albeit simple, seems quite interesting. By restraining the receptive field, the proposed approach models global and patch-level distribution in a structured way, allowing for learning from few defect samples. The effectiveness is also demonstrated by experiments like Fig. 8 and Table 4."

It is not clear with me why these descriptive captions are essential and how they are used in practical systems? To me, it seems that captions are not as accurate as the provided semantic masks. And in what way can these captions improve the defect inspection system?\n\n2. Figure 8 looks quite interesting, but it seems a bit incomplete. In Fig. 8, there is a clear trend that when adding more synthetic samples, the performance of both approaches is boosted. Thus, It would be more interesting if results of further increasing the ratio of synthetic data can be shown. \n\n3. It seems the the sampling strategy for generated samples could be improved. In the paper, it seems that the quantity of generated samples is at a fixed ratio to the real samples. In this sense, if there is a lot of real data for certain object, then model would generate a lot of synthetic data, and vice versa. This is a bit counter-intuitive to me. It seems more reasonable that for those objects with limited number of real data, we should generate more synthetic data to mitigate the overfitting problem."
