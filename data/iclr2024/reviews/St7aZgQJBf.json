                "value": "This paper investigates the robustness of deep metric learning models to adversarial ranking attacks. The authors first show that even simply initializing a retrieval model with an adversarially trained model on a classification task can greatly improve its robustness to adversarial ranking attacks. Based on this observation, the authors further argue that initializing deep metric models with adversarially trained ones and then performing adversarial ranking defense can further improve their resistance to adversarial ranking attacks. Experimental results on multiple datasets support the authors' findings."

Besides, the authors provide experimental results on multiple datasets, which increases the robustness of their findings and reinforces the significance of their approach. This adds credibility to the research and strengthens the impact of the results.\n\nThis paper addresses an important problem in deep metric learning and explores the robustness of retrieval models against adversarial ranking attacks."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Weaknesses:\n\nLack of novelty: The paper's main finding, that using adversarial trained models to initialize retrieval models improves their robustness against adversarial ranking attacks, is not surprising. Adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to enhance robustness in various downstream applications. Therefore, this finding cannot be considered as novel. If there are any novel aspects, they might lie in the quantitative experiments conducted on the improvement in retrieval tasks.\n\nAmbiguity in the concept of curriculum learning: The paper claims to propose a CURRICULUM METRIC LEARNING method, but it is observed that there is a lack of direct connection between the pre-training task and the subsequent adversarial training task in retrieval. Additionally, the authors have not provided any contributions related to the curriculum. As a result, it is challenging to perceive the proposed method as a CURRICULUM METRIC LEARNING approach.\n\nInsufficient analysis of experimental conclusions: Although the experimental results demonstrate performance improvement, there is a lack of in-depth analysis. The authors could further explore the reasons behind the improvement and explain why specific adversarial training initialization methods are more effective in enhancing the robustness of retrieval models. Such analysis would strengthen the credibility of the experimental conclusions."

            "questions": {

This would help to better understand the underlying mechanisms and provide insights into the importance of this approach in the context of retrieval models.\n\n-Considering the characteristics of robust feature learning and the unique property of retrieval models, are there any specific modifications or adaptations that can be made to further optimize the utilization of adversarial training for improved robustness in retrieval? It would be valuable to explore how to harness the advantages of robust feature learning and tailor it specifically for retrieval tasks, rather than applying it in a generic manner."
