This process is repeated on random pair of dimensions, with random rotation angle, until the desired sparsity (or, density) is achieved.\nThe authors provide an exact formula for the expected density after a given number of rotation, which allows a precise design of the resulting initialization.\n\nThe authors provide a thorough evaluation of the method for different activation functions, under different static sparse training methods, and show compelling results when compared to *approximate* initialization.\nAnother comparison in done over a 1000 layer MLP with no residual connections nor normalization layers.\nWhen trained on MNIST and CIFAR10 the proposed method achieves performance comparable to a dense network with only 12% of the weights.\nFinally, the authors perform a comparison of several modern architectures on the mini-imagenet. \nWith the sole exception of EfficientNet, the proposed method supersedes the existing sparse approaches, and narrows the gap to dense training with only 10% of the weights."

For instance, the majority of readers will not be able to under the SAO method. The paper should be self-contained.\n\nThe link between sparse training and sparse initialization is not clear. It is well understood that within a larger dense network, a small subnet is usually contributing the most. This contribution is different for different settings, e.g., one might want individual subnetworks to perform a task within a multi-tasking/meta-learning setting.\n\nI request authors to support the claim that post-pruning performance is better than sparse initialization-based training. IMHO, if the parameter mask is learned or adaptive during training, the performance is usually better. The depth and architecture of the network also play a significant role in deciding up to what levels a network can be pruned, which essentially connects to the idea of effective dimension/degree of freedom given the constraint local structure imposed by the architecture. \n\nOrthogonal initialization (sparse/non-sparse) just ensures effective signal propagation and not generalization. In the end, if the goal is effective training and achieving the best performance, how crucial is Exact Orthogonality? Unless we regularize the network, which might impact the stability, memory requirements and compute complexity."

In addition, it seems Masks in GraSP/Synflow are adaptive over iterations, contrary to the setting introduced by the authors. \n\n\nThe construction of EOI for conv kernels using random entries in the mask to achieve the desired density is not explained in detail. Is it guaranteed to be exactly orthogonal in this case, too?\n\nMost results are empirical, and I wish authors have focused on theory to derive expressions for Dynamical Isometry in the proposed setting.

Existing methods often rely on predefined dense weight initialization to create these masks. However, such an approach might not efficiently harness the potential impact of these masks on the training process and optimization.\n\nInspired by research on dynamical isometry, the authors take an alternative route by introducing orthogonality into the sparse subnetwork. This orthogonality helps mitigate issues related to the vanishing or exploding gradient signal, ultimately making the backpropagation process more reliable.\n\nThe authors introduce their novel method called Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI). Unlike other existing approaches, EOI provides exact orthogonality, avoiding approximations. It also allows for the creation of layers with various densities."
