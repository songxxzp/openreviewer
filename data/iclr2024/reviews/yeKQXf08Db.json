At the same time, existing methods for hyperparameter search often lack theoretical guarantees and cannot be directly applied to real-world problems. To address this, the paper introduces a a double-layer BOB framework named CDT, for learning the hyperparameters. This models the hyperparameter selection issue as a continuum-arm Lipschitz bandit problem, ultimately providing sub-linear regret theoretical guarantees. Moreover, the method demonstrates significant performance improvements in experiments."

Though I am positive in general, some clarifications regarding the current draft are needed:\n\n- The authors propose Algorithm 1 to zoom quickly into a good area in the parameter space. However, this introduces extra hyper-parameters in Algorithm 1 which is unclear to tune. The authors say that it is possible to mitigate this issue by adding another layer of EXP3, essentially treating the epoch size candidate in Alg. 1 as arms. Then how sensitive is the overall performance wrt the parameters of outer EXP3 layer?\n\n- A follow-up on the previous question. While the master EXP3 algorithm does compete with the base algorithms (with different epoch parameters) in terms of their actual performance during the run, this performance could be significantly worse than if the base algorithm were run on its own, updating its state after every prediction. For instance, a base algorithm which is performing bad initially but excels later on might quickly fall out of favor with the master,  never reach its good performance regime. How do you address this problem? How are the base-learners defined? Doesn't this problem persist, even if we are only trying to optimize a given bandit algorithm like linUCB over a discrete candidate set of hyper-parameters? This is essentially the same problem faced by corralling a band of bandits literature (eg. https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06246).\n\n- I am confused about the usefulness of having fixed length epochs between two restarts in Alg.1. For example, we can expect that after sufficient number of rounds, the expected reward is stable. So isn't it more practical to have an adaptive restart schedule where one restarts more often during earlier rounds and less toward later rounds?  Further, I agree with the authors that similar hyper-parameter choices most often can result in similar arms getting pulled. However, there could be discontinuities in the rewards as a function of hyper-parameters. So I am curious, why the authors didn't study the case where the reward at a round is also modelled as a piece-wise lipschitz function of hyper-parameters: meaning the parameter space is partitioned into several clusters. within each cluster the reward is a lipschitz function.\n\n- How do you tune Alg.1 wrt sub-gaussian parameter $\\tau$ present in the noise of Eq.(2)?"
