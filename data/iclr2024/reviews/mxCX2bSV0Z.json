It is similar to the approach in the continuous action version of homomorphism (Rezaei-Shoshtari et al., 2022). The action can be one-hot encoded.

                "value": "1. There are several important points not clarified or explained in the paper. For example, how can we learn good forward and backward models with function approximators? In theory, accurate forward and backward prediction requires complete coverage of the state action space, which can be even more expensive than learning a policy (without abstraction). But the algorithm directly assumes the availability of such models, which is unrealistic.\n2. The success of the abstract largely depends on the correctness of the forward and backward models. If any of them give incorrect or biased prediction, the learned homomorphisms and values will fail. Combined with point 1 above, I am not convinced how the proposed algorithm can be widely applicable.\n3. Although the paper tries to demonstrate empirical results on different benchmarks, the experiment still looks a bit limited. Only Q learning or DQN are considered as the base algorithm. Can it be combined with other RL algorithms such as PPO or SAC? \n4. The return on Asterix is much lower than reported by prior papers. The original nature DQN paper has return 6012 on Asterix, but why is the return reported by this paper below 20? Is there any rescaling of the reward?\n5. From experimental results, the improvement made by the algorithm is mainly on the converging speed or sample complexity. However, I am not sure whether it is a fair comparison with baselines, since the proposed method trains the policy over a pretrained forward/backward model, which already consumes a lot of samples. \n6. The notations are not clear and sometimes confusing. For example, the hypothetical actions are sometimes referred to as $a_{hyp}$ and sometimes as $\\hat{a}$. In Eq (7), $a^\\prime$ is never defined. $\\sigma$ is sometimes a function of states, sometimes a function of state-action pairs. In Eq (8), should the first $s^\\prime$ be $\\bar{s^\\prime}$? Although the meanings can be roughly inferred from the context, it is still not reading-friendly."

The paper argues that RL systems can achieve greater sample efficiency by using a type of homomorphism they call Equivalent Effect Abstractions (EEAs). \n\nPresumably, EEAs permit one to map between representations of environment state while preserving the original reward structure. Provided that such mappings exist, can be efficiently implemented, and one can map multiple environment states to a single encoding, then a learning system can plausibly use the encodings to generalize policy evaluations / improvements over states.\n\nThe paper makes several claims.\n1. It is possible to efficiently learn EEAs.\n2. Learning EEAs requires no prior knowledge of reward structure.\n3. EEAs reduce the size of the state-action space \"by a factor equal to the cardinality of the action space.\"\n4. EEAs can be used to improve the sample efficiency of policy learning.\n\nI am recommending this paper is rejected, as it lacks support for all of its claims. Specifically, the paper contains little to no support for 1, 2, and 3. And the empirical support for claim 4 is not convincing.

However, their input-output signatures are not described, and their parameters seem to change from Equation 6 to Algorithm 1.\n* The paper fails to describe how EEAs, and its associated learning process, fit within the standard RL framework of action, observation, and reward. This is essential for others in the community to use the idea---to know how a step of policy evaluation or improvement is performed.\n* The scope with which EEAs are presented is too broad, and this gives EEAs a somewhat nebulous identity. According to the paper, they apply to both tabular and deep settings, and settings where models are both available and learned. However, the paper provides no specific description of how the idea was instantiated in each respective setting. Ironically, the little information that is used to define EEAs limits their scope to a restrictive degree.\n* The paper fails to establish EEAs as a distinct idea, separate from prior work in homomorphic MDPs (van der Pol et al., 2020) and using bisimulation methods.\n\n(Technically unsound) The empirical results do not provide sufficient support for claim 4.\n* Current methodology fails to account for the pre-training experience used to learn the EEA.\n* Experiments are missing important baselines. For instance, a standard model-based learner that doesn't also learn a homomorphism.\n* Experiments use an inconsistent methodology between baselines---for example, different numbers of seeds.\n* Experiments show learning curves, but should go further---to translate them into metrics of sample efficiency, such as steps of experience (accounting for pre-training).\n\n(Limited significance) The main contribution is potentially limited, as it only applies to fully-observable, deterministic MDPs where rewards are strict functions of state (i.e. no action dependence.)\n\n(Limited significance) Related work does not make connections to paper's main ideas.\n\n(Poor presentation) Mathematical notation is sometimes overloaded and often undefined."
