The proposed algorithm requires strong supervision feedback on whether each instance is OOD data in the online learning procedure, which is difficult to satisfy in real-world applications. In this problem setting (whether an instance is OOD data is available), the learning task is then over-simplified. Such a strong supervision assumption makes the proposed method straightforward, which is a simple extension of online learning algorithms with a specific loss function, that is, combine of ID loss and OOD loss in this draft.\nWhile the authors also offer an unsupervised version that does not require environmental feedback and shows promising empirical results, it lacks solid theoretical guarantees, which limits the applicability of the proposed method.\n\n2. The theoretical results in this work are well established in the online learning literature, which limits the technical contribution of this research. These results are relatively straightforward to obtain when a specific convex loss function is specified. In this draft, it is the combination of the ID loss and the OOD loss. It's also worth noting that the literature typically uses adaptive regret or dynamic regret to capture the non-stationarity of the environment, as opposed to the static regret used in this draft.\n\n\n3. Regarding the implementation of the algorithm, determining the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ for OOD detection before and during the online learning process seems to be challenging. Furthermore, the authors do not elaborate on how $\\lambda$ is determined in the experiments or how it affects the algorithm's performance. There is also no published code."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The weaknesses of this paper are as follows:\n- Originality and Significance: My main concern about the paper is the originality of the proposed method. It seems to me that Algorithm 2 (and Algorithm 3 in the Appendix) is a direct application of the classical Online Gradient Descent (OGD) algorithm [1, Chapter 3.1] with the cross-entropy loss. The regret analysis for OGD is somewhat standard. Although the authors have provided some related work discussion, I am unconvinced by the claim \"...our framework differs in that we deal with non-stationary OOD data in the context of OOD detection.\" For the classical online convex optimization framework, the loss function can be arbitrarily different at each round (under certain boundedness assumptions); the framework can already be used for non-stationary data.\n\n- About the Feedback: In the main paper, the algorithm is developed based on the assumption that the labels of the OOD data are available after the learner has made the prediction. This seems like a strong assumption to me since the main challenge of OOD detection lies in the lack of supervision of OOD data. When the labeled OOD data are available, I am confused about what the difference is between the proposed framework and supervised online learning. Although the authors show in the Appendix that one can also use unsupervised loss functions to perform OOD detection, it is unclear how the proposed unsupervised loss is (theoretically) guaranteed to output a well-performing OOD detector, which makes the method less appealing.\n\n- About the Theoretical Analysis: I think the statement of Theorem 3.1 is somewhat informal, as the conditions of the loss functions and parameter settings are not provided. It seems to me that the analysis in the Appendix crucially relies on the convexity of the loss function, and thus, the linear model is applied. However, in the main paper, the algorithm is equipped with a neural network. I think it would be better if the authors could clearly mention the discrepancy between the theory and algorithm implementation."

It seems to me one can also apply similar arguments as Theorem 2 to obtain a regret bound in terms of $\\mathcal{L}_t^H$, but it is unclear why minimizing $\\mathcal{L}_t^H$ can lead to a well-performed detector that can eventually minimize the true loss function $\\mathcal{L}_t$.\n- As shown by the equation above (63), it seems to me that the setting of the learning rate $\\eta$ requires the knowledge of $T$, $\\mathbb{K}^{id}$ and $\\mathbb{K}^{ood}$, which are unknown in practice. It would be better if the authors could provide more discussions on how to select the parameters for the algorithm."
