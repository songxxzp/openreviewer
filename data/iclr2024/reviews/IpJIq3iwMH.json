This problem has many practical applications. However, it is NP-hard to solve it exactly. This paper considers a heuristic approach based on the proximal gradient descent. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a federated proximal-gradient-descent algorithm for BMF (FELB) and its adaptive version (FALB). In theory, it proves the convergence of these algorithms and shows some differential privacy guarantees. In experiments, it tests the new algorithms in several different datasets and demonstrates advantages in accuracy and efficiency over prior approaches."

However, it is a heuristic and also increases the time complexity for the server. The paper does not theoretically show the convergence rate of the algorithm. Furthermore, the analysis relies on a strong assumption of the loss function. The writing of this paper could be improved. For example, more intuition for the proximal operator should be provided.

                "value": "The contribution of the paper seems limited. This is a straightforward extension of the method of Dalleiger et al. to the federated setting. Each client applies the same method, then the $V_i$ updates are aggregated on the server. The main algorithmic novelty seems to be to how aggregation is done, and the idea was to apply the proximal operator (the *same one used by Dalleiger et al.*) to the mean of the updates.\n\nThe theoretical result (convergence of the iterates in Proposition 4.1) has several issues.\nFirst, the proof is wrong. It is argued that the gradients tend to 0, thus the iterates converge. This is not true (think of the sequence $x_k = 1/k$).\nEven if the proof were to be corrected, the result is still very weak. It only claims that the process converges (to a binary solution) without saying anything about the limit's utility (for example whether this limit is close to the solution). Such a result can be obtained by a trivial algorithm (for example one that uses a step size of 0 after a finite number of steps).\n\nThe paper also seems completely unaware of the extensive literature on private matrix completion (it is claimed in the related work that \"algorithms for matrix factorization seek computational efficiency while disregarding privacy aspects\"). The problem has been studied (without the binary constraints) in a number of papers both in the central and federated settings [1-4]. Even though the exact setting is different (due to the binary constraints) the methods are closely related, and several ideas used in this paper were already proposed in prior work. For example, this paper proposes \"partial sharing\" (sharing the V factor but keeping the U_i factors local to each client), but this exact scheme was used in [1-5] (in the privacy literature this is referred to as joint-DP or sometimes as the billboard model of DP).\n\nOther comments:\n- What is the motivation to add binary constraints in recommender systems? This does not seem to be a common practice. (Related to this point: some of the recommendation data sets used in experiments were used in prior work on private matrix completion, without binary constraints. It would be good to compare.)\n- In section 4, it is claimed that \"Without the knowledge of $U_i$, the server cannot estimate specific attributes of individual users\". This is not true. For example access to gradients can leak information about the client's data. This has been shown via reconstruction attacks (for example in [6] which looked specifically at matrix completion).\n- Privacy-related experiments: it seems that in all cases, for epsilon up to roughly 10, the loss exceeds 1 (which if I understand the loss definition correctly, means the learned solution is worse than even a trivial solution of all 0). This seems surprising, it basically means that learning is impossible except for very large epsilon. This might indicate that the method has not been properly tuned. Perhaps the authors should carefully revisit these experiments.\n- It is mentioned in the appendix that sensitivity was estimated by the maximum number of 1s in the input data. But note that this is a private quantity, and it should be estimated privately (not computed exactly), or you can perhaps set a maximum number then subsample each client to this number.\n- [a comment that does not affect my evaluation] the authors included their code in the supplementary material, and this is commendable. However, including code without comments or instructions on running experiments makes it virtually impossible to reproduce the results. Ideally, one should include at least a readme file with instructions on how to run the methods (and how to get the data).\n\n1. Chien et al.

IEEE Intelligent Systems, 2021\n\n========= Post rebuttal =========\nI thank the authors for their response regarding related work, sensitivity, and reconstruction attacks.\n\nRegarding the convergence proof: unfortunately the response indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of convergence. It is claimed in the paper that \"FELB converges to a stable binary solution\". Convergence was never proved. What was shown instead is that $\\|\\eta_t\\nabla F\\|$ converges to 0. Notice that what converges to 0 is the gradient *scaled by the learning rate* (indeed proving this is trivial, as the gradient is assumed to be bounded, and the learning rate is assumed to tend to 0).\nThis does not prove anything about convergence of the gradient, nor the trajectory.\n\nRegarding the relative loss: I understand that it can exceed 1. My point is that a relative loss exceeding 1 indicates a solution that's essentially useless, as even the trivial 0 solution would achieve a loss of 1. This indicates that the private method is not learning much except for very large epsilon. I encourage the authors again to revisit these experiments more carefully and investigate this poor performance.\n\nI maintain my initial assessment."
