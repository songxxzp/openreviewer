Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the In-Label-Space setting may deviate from the real-world challenges encountered in few-shot/zero-shot/meta-learning scenarios. In most cases, our primary interest in this field lies in enabling machines to learn novel entity types rather than knowing \u201cB-XX\u201d to infer \u201cI-XX\u201d.\n\n2.\tSince Figure 2 appears to be less informative on its own, a better approach would indeed be to combine Figure 1(b) and Figure 2. This combination would provide a clearer representation of the reputation within the context of these two figures.\n\n3.\tRegarding LayoutLMs and aligning multimodal inputs, it is important to consider how spatial/visual embeddings are handled for tag-related prompt tokens. \n\n4.\tIn Figure 2, there are two parts labeled as \u201cother embeddings.\u201d It would be helpful to understand the distinction between these two parts.\n\n5.\tThe datasets used in this study, such as FUNSD and XFUND-zh, are indeed relatively small and contain only a few entity types (e.g., only 3 in FUNSD). This limitation makes it challenging to fully assess the effectiveness of the In-Label-Space setting for few-shot SER on these specific datasets. Using CORD is suitable, but not enough.\n\n6.\tThe paper mentions that \u201cwords related to SER tags are used as a prompt,\u201d but it is not adequately explained what the tag-related prompt actually contains or how it is constructed. It would be beneficial for the author to provide some examples or utilize a running example prompt to illustrate the training process more clearly. This would help readers better understand what occurs during training and how the tag-related prompt influences the model\u2019s performance.\n\n7.\tTable 1 shows marginal improvements when using the full data but significant improvement when using only a few instances. However, for CORD, the improvement is not as significant. The reason behind this discrepancy is unclear and requires further investigation."

                "value": "To address few-shot Semantic Entity Recognition (SER) in visually-rich documents, the authors introduce PPTSER, a pluggable approach to existing multimodal pre-trained models. PPTSER reframes SER into two sub-tasks: entity typing, which assigns entity types to each token in the document, and span detection, which determines whether tokens are at the beginning or middle of an entity span. The core of PPTSER involves (1) using SER tags as a prompt, concatenating them with the document\u2019s tokens, and inputting them into a multimodal pre-trained model, and (2) using the attention weight from the last attention block between the tag-related prompt and the document\u2019s tokens as the probability of tokens belonging to each tag. Consequently, PPTSER eliminates the need for a classifier layer, reducing the total number of parameters. Experimental results on widely used SER benchmarks demonstrate that PPTSER outperforms both traditional fine-tuning methods and few-shot methods in both few-shot and full-data scenarios. The authors also conduct additional analyses of PPTSER to validate its effectiveness."
