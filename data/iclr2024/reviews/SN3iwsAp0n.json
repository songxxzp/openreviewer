                "value": "This paper focuses on two different subjects, DFQ (Data-Free Quantization) and DQ (Dynamic Quantization). DFQ is a research topic that quantizes neural networks without any data because the training dataset can be hard to access in real-world scenarios. DQ is finding optimal bit setting while inference, because the difficulty of each image is different, and a trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is also different accordingly. The paper proposes a method called DynaDFQ, which can solve the DFQ problem under DQ settings.\n\nThe paper adopts a bit selector which finds out the optimal bit setting of a given input image. In the DQ problem, the bit selector should be trained with real images, because it should be able to classify whether the given input is easy enough to infer with a lower bit. Thus, there is an obstacle to train Bit selector under DFQ scenarios, because the training dataset is not available. To solve this problem, the paper tries to generate images that show various difficulties. The paper assumes that a difficult image refers to a confusing image that is difficult to distinguish into one of several similar classes. Therefore, the paper adopts soft labels to generate difficult images. By doing so, generated images with soft labels can be used to train a bit selector. In addition, they also help enhance the performance of quantized networks."

However, the paper doesn\u2019t explain what\u2019s different between previous works and the proposed ones.\n- The paper measures the cost of each network with bit-flops. However, because DynaDFQ has an additional operation, which is called bit selector, further realistic analysis about costs should have been provided."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In terms of inference time, especially with low-bit and lightweight neural networks, it is important to reduce the number of accesses to DRAM. However, the bit selector needs other weight parameters that aren\u2019t related to the original network\u2019s weight parameters. Also, the output of the bit selector isn\u2019t reused in the original network. Furthermore, while operating the bit-selector, the hardware isn\u2019t likely to be fully utilized. These problems may lead to harm to the pipelining of the inference. Can the authors\u2019 opinions be provided?\n- DQ is for selecting whether to use a lower bit or not, according to the difficulty of each image. That is, DQ is finding better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, in Table 3 (a), accuracies of ZeroQ, IntraQ, and DSQ are improved when DQ is applied. Can the authors\u2019 explanation be provided?\n- HAST tried to generate hard samples too, which is different from the method proposed in this paper. When entropy is used as a measure of difficulty, the difficulty of images generated with DynaDFQ is higher than that of HAST. Can the authors measure the difficulties of images with GHM, which is used in HAST? It will be helpful to find out which method is more suit for measuring the difficulties of images.\n- It seems that DynaDFQ is only for processing one image at once. If a batch of inputs is delivered, how does the bit selector work?\n- The performance of the bit selector itself isn\u2019t described well. Can the authors provide a performance of the proposed method without a bit selector, to understand whether a bit selector works well or not? Also, can the precision and the recall of a bit selector be provided?\n- The paper builds soft labels only with classes that show high similarity. How does performance change if soft labels are built with arbitrary classes, or classes which consist of both high similarity and low similarity?"
