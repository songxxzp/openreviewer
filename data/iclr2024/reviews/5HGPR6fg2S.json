The\nprimary one is a **missing analysis of fundamental properties**. While\nI appreciate the broad range of different applications, this invariably\nmeans that some depth is lost and analyses are relatively superficial.\n\nIntroducing a new measure and then showing its utility requires a more\nin-depth view of data, though. For instance, when introducing the\nlatent representations in Table 1, readers are only shown the actual\nscores, but the primary assumption is that the scores actually capture\nthe relevant properties of the data. Phrased somewhat hyperbolically:\nI believe that NSA can be calculated as described, but I do not\nunderstand whether it measures something 'interesting.' The fact that it\ncorrelates with performance metrics is relevant, but immediately\nsuggests a more detailed comparison scenario, for instance in the form\nof an early stopping criterion or regularisation term. Otherwise, most\nof the analyses strike me as too speculative. I will provide additional\ncomments below.\n\n- I'd suggest to shorten the RTD explanation or substantially extend it.\n  Currently, it makes use of jargon like $\\min G(R, Q)$, 'barcode,' and\n  Vietoris--Rips filtrations that are not sufficiently explained (I am\n  familiar with the work and I believe that a deep dive into topological\n  methods is not required).\n\n- To simplify the notation, I'd either use the actual Euclidean norm in\n  the definition of NSA or write $x$ and $0$ as vectors.\n\n- The autoencoders experiment is somewhat out of place since the\n  introduction sets up a paper on GNNs. Given the broad scope of NSA,\n  I think it might be best to stay with the autoencoder comparison,\n  using data with a known ground truth. This could take the form of\n  building confidence by starting with simple toy examples like a 'Swiss\n  Roll' or other data sets and showing that NSA matches the intuition.\n\nOverall, my **main concern** is that the measure is just too coarse, in\nparticular given large data sets. It essentially amounts to comparing\naveraged distance representations, and more in-depth experiments and/or\ntheoretical analyses would be required here."

Being based on distances, NSA should be invariant under isometries.\n   Is this correct? (I'd overall suggest to simplify the exposition\n   here; many of the properties discussed are a direct consequence of\n   NSA being based on distances. It is good to be precise and spell that\n   out in the appendix, but I'd not give it too much space)\n\n4. How are the representations for Section 3.6 calculated? Is the NSA of\n   a specific data set calculated here, i.e. mapping a (batch?) of\n   graphs into the latent space? Please clarify!\n\n5. The definition of NSA reminds me of MMD (but lacking the\n   cross-comparison term). Could you briefly comment on this?\n\n6. Please show representations of MNIST, F-MNISt, etc.\n\n7.

NSA primarily focuses on measuring distances between two point clouds, neglecting the crucial graph edges. This oversight brings its capability to preserve graph structure into question. Moreover, although the paper intends to underscore NSA's unique potential in the context of Graph Neural Networks, the actual exploration of these capabilities is missing.\n\nIssues with Experimental Validation:\n 1. Lack of Downstream Task Evaluation: Given that NSA is proposed as a loss function, it is critical to evaluate its effectiveness in downstream tasks. Unfortunately, the paper lacks such evaluations. Insights into how the latent embeddings from an autoencoder, shaped by NSA, could enhance downstream task performance are notably missing.\n\n  2. Dataset Limitations: The paper\u2019s conclusions are drawn from experiments conducted solely on the Amazon Computers dataset for node classification. Different graph datasets possess varied properties and can elicit diverse behaviors, making it imperative to extend the analysis to a broader set of datasets for more robust and convincing results.\n\n  3. Inconsistency in Data Analysis: There is a puzzling contrast between the paper\u2019s stated focus on Graph Neural Networks (and graph data) and the NSA-AE analysis, which is not applied to graph datasets. \n\n   4. Adversarial Attack Analysis Shortcomings: The attempt to correlate NSA values with misclassification rates, aiming to use NSA as a metric for evaluating GNN resilience, lacks conviction. NSA values exhibit significant variability across different GNN architectures, and potentially across various graph datasets. The observed discrepancy, where GCN shows the highest misclassification rate while GCN-SVD has the highest NSA value, further complicates any straightforward interpretation based on NSA values alone.\n\n  5. Readability of Figures: The figures included in the paper suffer from readability issues, with some fonts being excessively small, hindering the reader\u2019s ability to fully grasp and interpret the presented data."
