Experiments on Procgen demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

However, during experiments, the author uses the data from a simulator (Procgen). The pretrain data contains less visual complexity compared to real world data. I encourage author to explore pretraining with real world data (like MC YouTube videos [1] and first-view driving videos [2]). Or, the authors should at least make the pretraining data different from the RL observation data to simulate the difference between pretrain and finetune scenario. One way could be using different backgrounds in Procgen.\n2. In my opinoin, this paper could benefit from including references to a relevant work [2] which uses IDM to label the dataset and conduct contrastive learning for policy pretraining. \n3. I think this paper could benefit from additional comparison with [1] and [2]. It could provide additional insight of how methods that use extra data for IDM training perform compared to the proposed method. I am particularly interested in understanding whether training IDM  yields performance improvements or if the proposed method (without IDM) is already capable of achieving comparable, or even superior, results to the aforementioned prior works [1][2].\n\n[1] Video PreTraining (VPT): Learning to Act by Watching Unlabeled Online Videos. https://github.com/openai/Video-Pre-Training\n\n[2] Learning to drive by watching youtube videos: Action-conditioned contrastive policy pretraining. https://github.com/metadriverse/ACO"

The proposed algorithm LAPO aims to infer actions taking place between two consecutive observations of such data. LAPO models latent representations for the actions instead of trying to infer the true ground-truth action. It does so using two components -- inverse dynamics model (IDM) and forward dynamics model (FDM). The IDM's task is to generate a latent representation of the action that takes place between a given history of observations (including current observation) and the next observation. Consequently, the FDM's task is to generate the next observation given the current observation and a latent representation generated by IDM. Both these components are trained in conjugation to learn latent representations of unknown actions. These representations are further finetuned using true actions via either online rollout or matching actions in an offline dataset. The paper presents results on 16 discrete-action ProcGen environments."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "I find the following weaknesses in the paper:\n1. The utility of learned latent representations for large-scale pretraining: It is evident from the plots that the actions are meaningfully clustered. However, if one has enough compute, to me, it seems plausible to train a transformer autoregressively to generate the next observations in observation-only data, ensuring that the latent representation for actions is also learned. I raise this point because if such a pretraining is possible directly with transformers, the utility of LAPO reduces. Plus, if someone wants to apply the LAPO (IDM + FDM) approach, it could be inflexible compared to a transformer extension. Anyway, I do acknowledge that LAPO does provide evidence that it is possible to meaningfully identify actions in observation-only data.\n\n2. Issue with NOOP: From the IDM-FDM perspective, the NOOP being a null action, its latent representation should produce no transition when sent to FDM. It was unclear from the writing if there is any experimental validation of the same. Also, there is an issue with NOOP and actions with delayed effects. The present IDM-FDM model will fall short in modeling the two separately. (Authors briefly touch up on modeling the delayed effect actions, but I did not find their mention contrasting them with NOOP's.)\n\n3. LAPO with continuous action environments: The current implementation of LAPO involves using vector quantization (VQ). However, using VQ would, in principle, limit the actions to be chosen from a finite set of discrete codes. This, in turn, creates issues while scaling to continuous action environments. The ProcGen games, environments used in the experiments, are discrete action environments, too, and I find it difficult to see how the approach would scale to non-discrete real-world control tasks."

Do authors observe that NOOP IDM representation does not affect FDM's transition? \n3. Do NOOP IDM representations get clustered similarly to other actions? \n4. How does NOOP compare with actions with delayed effects?\n5. How will VQ-based LAPO fare in continuous action environments? \n6. What are the possible extensions to the current architecture that will allow us to use LAPO seamlessly on real-world continuous action control tasks?\n\nGiven these questions, I am presently inclined to borderline reject the work.

The approach involves training a inverse dynamics model (IDM) along with a Forward Dynamics Model (FDM) using an unsupervised objective. The IDM learns to predict the latent action given the past and future observation. FDM on the other hand uses the predicted latent action, and past action to predict the future observation. Training these two models together for predictive consistency helps learn latent actions that can reliably explain observed transitions. To prevent the model from compressing all of past observation\u2019s information into the latent action, the authors propose using vector quantization which acts as an information bottleneck. Finally, the authors show that latent actions can be mapped to real actions using online RL policy fine-tuning, or by using an offline dataset of action-labeled transitions. The authors show results on the Procgen benchmark. They show that the approach exceeds expert demonstrations by fine-tuning a policy pretrained with LAPO using significantly fewer number of steps.

In other words, the videos used during pre-training are of the same agent. I think this assumption is limiting. To leverage large-scale video data available on the internet, one of the key ingredients is learning from videos that doesn\u2019t necessarily match the action space of the agent. Imagine learning from Ego4D like ego-centric observations, and using it to execute tabletop rearrangement tasks. Or using RealEstate10K videos to learn how to navigate in indoor environments. \n2. Secondly, it would have also been nice to consider experiments on continuous control tasks. The approach uses a vector quantised latent space to model actions. Will such an approach also work for actions that are continuous control? \n3. Finally, the paper doesn\u2019t fully justify using vector quanitization approach to learn disentagled latent actions. While the empirical results do show the efficacy of this approach, I don\u2019t fully grasp why vector quantization based information bottleneck works. Additionally, did the author consider an approach like maximizing the conditional mutual information I(o_t+1 | a_t) while minimizing  I(o_t+1 | o_t)  (as in  Deep Variational Information Bottleneck, Alemi et al, 2016) to learn a latent action space that is consistent with the transition observed without over-relying on the past observations"
