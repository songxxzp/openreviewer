They also employ a regional search to expand on the search regions.\nThe paper also introduces a novel submodular function to provide clearer and more detailed explanations, especially for incorrect predictions based on four major clues - confidence, effectiveness, consistency and collaboration scores.\n\nThe effectiveness of this new method is supported by experiments on facial recognition and fine-grained image recognition datasets, where it is shown to perform better than the current SoTA methods."

The use of saliency maps $A$ in sub-region division is unclear. The paper should highlight how saliency maps are used to evaluate patch importance.\n3. Most of the scoring functions like  $s_{eff.}$, $s_{cons.}$ etc.  rely on cosine similarity or distance metrics which have been studied extensively in literature (Deng et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2018 etc.) but have not been cited in the paper.\n4. The paper lacks the explanation regarding how individual scores contribute to achieving their respective objectives. For example, $s_{colla.}$ employs a cosine distance metric between the semantic feature vector of the target class $f_s$ and features extracted from the residual regions of the original image when the selected subset of regions $S$ is removed. To the best of my knowledge, maximizing this metric ensures that the collective impact of the selected region is sufficient to generate explainable representations.\n5. The proposed greedy search algorithm (section 4.3) has been studied for subset selection tasks (Wei et al., 2015) and is therefore prior art.\n6. The paper misses a critical reference in submodular optimization (Fujishige, 2005) and should include it in the related work.\n7. The experiments should include ablations on $k$ which is the number of sub-regions selected from $V$."

It would be great to label the Input Image as $\\mathbf{I}$ and saliency / attribution map as $\\mathbf{A}$ in figure 1 for better clarity.\n3. It is unclear as to what $M$ signifies in the problem definition, which should be clarified in sections 3 and 4.2. \n4. Lemmas 1 and 2 alongside equations 10 and 11 are already discussed in the problem definition in section 3, thus should be removed with referencing.\n5. Theorem 1 is prior art (Nemhauser et al., 1978) and should just be cited.\n6. Although optional, it would be good to have a set of notations as this paper encapsulates multiple domains in Machine Learning.\n7. Experiments in section 5 indicate that the proposed method demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods. This shows the generalizability of the approach irrespective of the underlying model, which I believe can be highlighted for better impact."
