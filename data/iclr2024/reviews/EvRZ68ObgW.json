If my understanding is correct, this target reward distribution is generated by passing a prompt and human-generated demonstration into a ground-truth reward model. I see two problems with this process. \n\nFirst, if we already have access to human demonstration data, performing supervised fine-tuning is sufficient to align the pretrained model with sample-approximated human response distribution, and the reward over-optimization problem does not exist. From the experiment results, supervised fine-tuning seems to be on par with the proposed method, as well. In practice, RLHF is used precisely because human demonstrations are hard to obtain (CITE), and preference labels over pairs of generated text are much easier and cheaper to collect. \n\nSecond, if a ground-truth reward model is present, we essentially move away from RLHF to pure RL with a given (but unknown) reward model. This is a different problem from what the paper claims to solve. If indeed the paper only intends to deal with problems where an explicit reward model can be queried, this will significantly limit the scope of applications the proposed method can be applied to. In my opinion, this paper should not position itself as tackling the reward over-optimization problem in RLHF. \n\nApart from the above, I also list some questions below, but my evaluation is mainly based on the stated weaknesses in motivation."

Why is this a good metric? On page 5, the authors wrote \"these metrics allow for detecting unnatural and repetitive patterns in the generated text\". This seems to only cover a small aspect of the consequence of reward over-optimization. How can other consequences be detected?"

The proposed method aims to improve the reward to the level of human demonstrations, conditioned on the fact that we are given high-quality human demonstration data. In this case, how does the proposed method compare with direct supervised fine-tuning on the high-quality data?\n\n3. The main benefit of RLHF is its capability to extrapolate or generalize. One can maximize reward on unseen prompts, or maximize the reward on the seen prompts so that the generation can even outperform human demonstrations. Will the proposed method lose such capability by minimizing the L2 distance between the reward of the generated responses and target reward?\n\n4.

Although RL has seen a lot of success, there are cons to using RL for alignment, which can have harmful side effects if not the alignment is not performed carefully. The most popular technique for mitigating this harmfulness is incorporating KL regularization into the objective. This paper proposes an additional technique for mitigating this harmfulness that empirically performs better than the KL regularization. \n\nThe central idea of the proposed technique is to collect a distribution of generations given a prompt and optimize the average reward of these generations given a prompt. The intuition is that designing a reward function on a collection of single prompt-generation pairs versus multiple generations per prompt prevents the reward function from being easily exploited. When an LLM exploits the reward, this leads to the harmful side effects."

In particular, the authors suggest collecting additional generation per prompt and using that as a regularization for the reward. Most attempts to address reward over-optimization either clip the reward score, add regularization to the reward training procedure, or add additional regularization to the policy optimization but have not focused on regularizing the reward  when optimized with RL\n\n\n- Diversity of experiments: The authors perform experiments on three settings where issues can arise when optimizing LLM: calibrating sequence-level log-likelihood, over-specialization with a reward model, and multi-objective calibration.

If the model sequence-level likelihood starts to diverge, that indicates the over-specialization problems, and vice versa. Furthermore, the multi-objective use case is not a traditional objective optimized in RLHF, and for a fixed alpha, the multi-objective can be viewed as a single objective.

What does it mean for a single prompt to have multiple generation pairs? Does this mean that the human is providing suboptimal generations?\n3. What do you mean by target distribution? Why would a single prompt have a target distribution versus an optimal target?\n4. What is the difference between training a policy to maximize the KL divergence between some initial policy \\pi_0 and maximizing the sequence-level log-likelihood of \\pi_0?\n\n\nTechnical Questions:\n1. When you defined D := (x, t(x)) - what is t(x)? \n2. How is the target distribution learned from single-prompt multiple-generation pairs? Is it the average of the generation rewards?\n3. How do you build a prompt-continuation dataset based on public datasets? For example, in IMDB, you have a set of movie reviews, but merely grouping reviews using their first 10 tokens is a heuristic that is not generalizable. In particular, this observation would be an artifact of the prompt length; as you increase the prompt length, the overlap of generations would decrease.\n4. For a given prompt x, the dataset consists of a set of generations for that prompt, i.e. {(x,y_i)}_{i=1}^{n}, where n is the number of generations per prompt. If this is the setting, then in equation 3, what is y? Is it a particular prompt in the set of prompts for a generation? If so, how do you choose which prompt to compare to the LLM-generated response \\hat{y}?\n5. Step 2 defines prompt data with a tuple instead of a set of tuples, meaning the dataset only has one prompt-generation pair instead of a set of prompt generations.\n6. For minimizing the sequence-level log-likelihood, the most straightforward thing to do is to optimize the InstructGPT objective PPO-ptx [1], which includes a pretraining loss into the RL objective. How does your proposed algorithm compare to simply including that objective in the RL optimization procedure?\n7. For the calibration experiments, I am not sure if the benefit is coming from the change in the reward function or the additional samples that you collect. It seems the reason why your algorithm is performing better is because you are taking the difference between y and \\hay{y} - which provides a fixed target to optimize. But this situation does not generalize to the preference dataset when you don't have a ground truth y. Instead, you have comparison data; it is not obvious what the ground truth target would be. I am unsure how this use case is representative of the RLHF problems.\n8. The results for calibration show various sampling schemes' performance, but what sampling scheme did you choose for your algorithm and the baseline RL algorithm?\n9. What is the difference between your alignment loss and MLE?\n10. How does R_reg perform on the multi-objective experiments?\n11. Did you tune \\alpha in the multi-objective experiments? If so how did you tune \\alpha?\n12. In Figure 4, the metrics arrows conflict with the best scores. For example, R^{pref} arrow it points upward, and the best score is 5.64, but you bolded 4.15. This issue is consistent with a few other metrics as well."
