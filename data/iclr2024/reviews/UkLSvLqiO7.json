In particular, it starts by showcasing the phenomenon that if initialized with the same noisy images and using a deterministic sampler, well-trained diffusion models with widely ranging architectures, training and sampling procedures all produce highly similar images on CIFAR-10. The paper analyses this further and uncovers two distinct regimes where this happens: The overparametrized, \u2018memorization regime\u2019, where only a small part of the CIFAR-10 data set is used, and the \u2018generalization regime\u2019, where the full CIFAR-10 data set is used. Importantly, there is a gap in between these extremes where the different models do not agree. The effect is measured quantitatively using metrics for comparing image pairs, confirming the result. The mapping from noise to images is visualized and shown again to be similar among different models, as well as smooth. A theoretical study in the \u2018memorization\u2019 regime is provided, and reproducibility is demonstrated in conditional generation, inverse problems and fine-tuned models as well."

All diffusion models are trained to estimate the exact same score function \u2014 even if they have different architectures and are trained separately \u2014 the target is always the same. Hence, if the diffusion models are trained perfectly, then it is actually expected that they will all map the same noise to the same output. The small deviations in the shown images in Figure 1, just indicate that there are some learning errors. The finding should stay the same even if we use different samplers, as long as the samplers arrive with guarantees that given enough steps and access to the score they will sample from the right distribution. The only surprising fact to me in this paper is the claim that models trained with different corruption processes will have this property. This doesn\u2019t make much sense to me because for VE SDE and VP SDE for example, even the terminal distribution is different, so how do we even start from the same noise?
