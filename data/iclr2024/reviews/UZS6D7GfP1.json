It's important to clarify why one should use Gramtector and not watermarking in Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), given that watermarking has high accuracy? Watermarking is interpretable as well. The number of green tokens and the z-test gives an interpretable score for detection. It can also highlight snippets in text that might be potentially AI-generated. I do not agree with the authors mentioning that \"all of these methods do not provide an explanation of why some text has been classified as AI\" in the introduction.\n2. For adversarial paraphrasing in B.2, how are the lists of \"do not use the phrases\" and \"use a lot more of the phrases\" generated? Are these the top features? How many features does the detector use in this setting?\n3. The authors mention, \"we query the LLM under consideration to produce similar texts\". In B.1, it's shown that for arXiv abstracts, the LLMs are only prompted to generate with high-level instructions and a paper title. How would the detection performance change if the LLMs were prompted to write in a particular style? For example, what if the LLMs were given an example human abstract in the prompt and was instructed to generate another one with the same style?\n4. In table 2, why are the values of Gramtector for \"Original model\" and \"Adversarial prompting\" the same? There is no discussion on why the AUROC is maintained after adversarial paraphrasing."

The paper also conducts an actual human-in-the-loop survey, with a number of types of interactions with the data, and shows the best-performing way of combining the machine-generated features with human labelers (i.e., giving grammatical patterns, but not the full classification results)\n\nThe insight in the paper about the relative immutability of LLM grammatical patterns, versus the use of certain words or phrases is also important. It is this observation that is central to the proposed method paper and does work quite well and quite robustly in practice."

The paper essentially only proposes a standard supervised machine learning model that works on existing part-of-speech tagging algorithms. While this type of approach is powerful when combined with human labelers, it is not, by itself a significant contribution. Furthermore, from the human trials, the fact that there is better performance by only exposing human labelers to the part-of-speech tags versus to the actual labels from the gramtect model further decreases the utility of the proposed technical contribution. Perhaps greater performance and a more technical contribution could have been achieved by doing something like having gramtect label the sequence and then an LLM provides an explanation as to why the sequence was labeled as it was to the user.\n\nAlso, there are some clarity issues with the paper. Most notably, I cannot find details of which features the regularized model selected nor how the model was trained (e.g., cross-validation, which datasets, etc.)"

For example, people will commonly write a rough draft of a text, especially something like an e-mail, and then have the LLM clean up any grammar or clarity issues. Would something like this be counted as LLM-generated text, or not? And, what would this method do in this case? Another example would be having an LLM write the first draft and then a human goes back through the text to clean up parts they don\u2019t particularly like or add to what the LLM produced. Such a practice is used in more creative writing. \n-\tHow is the text handled for classification with gramtect? In section 5.1, it looks like all of the text of a sample is fed to the model and given one classification. In section 5.2, its not clear if individual sentences are fed to the model for a classification or if there is some kind of text matching between features learned in 5.1 and the test text given to human labelers.\n-\tWhat is $TV()$ in the lit review?\n-\tIs the 100.004 distinct grammatical features on page 5 meant to be 100,004 distinct features?"
