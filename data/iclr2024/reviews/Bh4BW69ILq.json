At the same time, the latter provides a non-asymptotic convergence rate in terms of tau. I believe that even for PUOT obtaining the convergence rate in terms of tau would not be too difficult.\n- While CROT indeed yields sparsity compared to an entropic-regularized transport plan, an $\\ell_2$-regularized transport plan would also induce sparsity while giving an accelerated convergence rate.\n- There is no complexity analysis for algorithm 1. Judging by the numerical experiments, I believe that the proposed method will be slower than the entropic-regularized Sinkhorn (which is expected since the entropic regularization induces acceleration) or the gradient extrapolation method in [1].\n- The theoretical contribution is quite limited, as the authors only use KKT conditions to derive the transform coefficients.\n\nReferences\n[1] \"On Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Gradient Methods, Sparsity and Approximation Error\".\nQuang Minh Nguyen, Hoang Huy Nguyen, Lam Minh Nguyen, Yi Zhou"

So this is not the first work. \n\n2) This paper lacks mathematical rigor in the formulation and development of the methods. The idea is presented in a very heuristic form.\n- Proposition 1 is given using the notion of \"transformed pairwise distance\" that is never properly introduced in the paper. Maybe  solving the optimal \"transformed pairwise distance\" might correspond to solving the original UOT problem, thereby invalidating the whole purpose of this paper. Other results are also very informal.\n- Following up the above comment, the Algo 1 in the paper runs iteratively to adjust the \"transformed pairwise distance\" (I know it's $s_{ij}$, but it is equivalent way of saying), but we can't know how long it should run to converge.\n- Following up the above comment, you in fact do not equivalently yet approximately convert the UOT/PUOT problem into OT. Moreover, we cannot know how good such approximate conversion is. So your whole framework and idea, though interesting, are invalid. Please note that even if you use OT solver to solve your converted OT problem, how would you next retrieve your UOT solution out of that because your equivalence is approximate in the first place?\n\n3) Experiments are on synthetic data only, and thus are very weak.\n\n\n[1] Nguyen, Quang Minh, Hoang Hai Nguyen, Yi Zhou and Lam M.

Using these coefficients, iterative algorithms are proposed to estimate first the marginal distributions and the Lagrange multipliers of the corresponding problems. In a second stage a Cost-Reweighted OT (CROT) problem is formulated with the estimated marginals and with a modified cost matrix that takes into account the multipliers in order to compute the sought coupling matrix. Numerical experiments illustrates the estimated marginals, the computation timings, the quality of estimated coupling matrix by CROT on simulated datasets.

The proposed algorithm not only outputs the transform coefficients that allow to compute the modified marginals but also the Lagrange multipliers $\\boldsymbol{s}$ associated to the positivity constraint on $\\pi$. $\\boldsymbol{s}$ provides information of the sparsity pattern of $\\pi$. This is exploited by the Cost-Reweighted OT (CROT) problem which computes the coupling matrix of the UOT/PUOT problem.\n- Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method provides a computation gain compared to competitors (Majorization-Minimization algorithm, regularization path).

The same remark holds for PUOT related algorithm. \n- Formal proofs or elements of proof of the theoretical results on which CROT algorithm is based are not proposed. Also theoretical guarantees on the discrepancy between the estimated $\\pi^*$ by CROT and the true coupling matrix corresponding to the UOT are not provided.\n- The motivation of solving the reweighted OT using Sinkhorn, OT with L2-norm or sparse OT algorithm is a bit hazy. Moreover those solvers necessitate hyper-parameters that are not easy to tune.  As such the obtained coupling matrix $\\pi$ may highly differ from the one that can be achieved while solving directly the UOT/PUOT problem using existing methods.\n- The reported empirical evaluations are not always convincing. For instance, when assessing the quality of $\\pi^*$ by CROT, the distance $\\sum_{ij} |\\pi^*_{ij} - \\pi^o_{ij}|$ where $\\pi^o$ is the solution of a plain OT (according to my understanding) computed by network-flow algorithm. It would be fair and meaningful to contrast $\\pi^*$ with the coupling matrix given by existing UOT or PUOT solvers. Another example is Figure 4 which illustrates $\\pi^*$ on a UOT problem with $\\tau=10^5$. Such setting will enforce the marginal constraints to be met, leading to a coupling solution close to OT.  Therefore, it is unclear why Figure 4 does consider Sinkhorn instead of non-regularized OT. \n- In the domain adaptation task, Table 1 does not consider JUMBOT coupled with UOT solved by existing methods in order to provide a fair evaluation and assess the benefit of CROT over existing UOT solvers on this specific application. \n- Authors should proof read the paper for some inconsistent text formulations."

                "value": "- The derivation of transform coefficients is based on the assumption that $||\\boldsymbol{a}||_1 = ||\\boldsymbol{b}||_1$. In some UOT cases this assumption may not hold true. How the method behaves in such setting?\n- The Lagrange parameters $\\boldsymbol{s}$ provides the sparsity pattern of $\\pi$. Instead of introducing the modified cost matrix $\\tilde{ \\boldsymbol{C}}$ and the extra hyper-parameter $\\eta$, why the paper does not solve directly an OT problem with some entries of $\\pi$ fixed to null values according to the sparsity map encode by $\\boldsymbol{s}$?\n- Theoretically, how close is the estimated coupling matrix $\\pi^*$ by CROT to the true coupling matrix corresponding to the UOT problem?\n- In the timing evaluation another baseline method to be considered is the MM method for L2-penalty along with the regularization path."

(2.4) of Chizat et al. (2018) where the divergence function is the KL divergence. They analyze the KKT conditions for this problem and propose an iterative algorithm for obtaining the marginal probabilities of the solution. Then, these marginal probabilities can be plugged into a standard (balanced) OT solver."

The unique contribution here is that the resulting transport map is sparse. However, the benefit of that is not clear to me.\n* There is no analysis of the convergence speed of Algorithm 1.\n* The approach seems to scale poorly and accordingly the experimental data sets are all very small. The iterations of Algorithm 1 are O(NM), as expensive as Sinkhorn iterations, and that's before the main step of solving the OT problem. \n* The text needs to be thoroughly copy-edited as it contains numerous errors. e.g. \"it does not match most of situations\", \"for avoid heavy computations\", \"if s_i,j is much approaches to 0\", etc.\n* The text in the figures in tiny. Figure 3 is unreadable when printing in black&white."
