It introduces the margin discrepancy and establishes a generalization bound, addressing a significant gap in the field.\n\nNovel MDAT Method: The proposed MDAT method is innovative and leverages the theoretical insights effectively. It offers a principled approach to addressing MDTC, which outperforms existing methods in empirical experiments.\n\nEmpirical Validation: The paper not only presents theory but also supports it with empirical results on real datasets. The fact that MDAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both benchmarks demonstrates its practical significance.\n\nClear Presentation: The paper is well-structured and clearly presented. The problem, methods, and results are organized in a way that is easy to follow."

The performance improvement brought by the new method is not substantial and requires a detailed explanation of why this is the case.

This feedback aims to guide the authors in achieving that balance.

                "value": "1. The theoretical contribution appears to be trivial. Techniques such as \"calculating the centroid of the M domains\" have already been employed in MAN [1]. The concept of the marginal discrepancy bound was previously introduced by MDD [2]. Merely combining these techniques doesn't seem sufficiently innovative to be deemed non-trivial.\n\n2. There seems to be a flaw in the model design. Specifically, the private feature extractor does not leverage the power of domain-specific feature. This contradicts the authors' claim that it can \"captures domain-specific features\".  I will explain it step by step.\n\n    The issue arises when the private feature is concatenated with the shared feature and then inputted into both classifiers. As a result, any private feature becomes domain-invariant. This is enforced by the min-max game played between the two classifiers, even though each private feature extractor only has access to one specific domain. \n\n     I want to emphasize that margin discrepancy simply acts as another measure of domain difference. If the model reaches its optimal state, the optimization of margin discrepancy across various domains ensures that the extractor aligns each domain\u2019s distribution to the same latent space, leading to domain-invariant encoding. For a detailed explanation on how two classifiers still enforce domain-invariant features, even without a domain discriminator, the authors can refer to paper MCD [3].\n\n    The authors might counter-argue that the inclusion of a private feature extractor enhances performance compared to using only the shared feature extractor. However, there could be two reasons for this: (1) the model might not be in its optimal state, as domain differences persist for both private and shared features. This allows the private feature to retain some domain-specific information. (2) Introducing a private feature extractor might simply increase the model\u2019s parameters, leading to better performance.\n\n    I strongly recommend that the model should not feed the private feature into both classifiers, mirroring the approach taken by MAN [1]. This modification could further enhance the model's performance.\n\n[1] Chen, Xilun, and Claire Cardie. \"Multinomial adversarial networks for multi-domain text classification.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1802.05694 (2018).\n\n[2] Yuchen Zhang, et al.
