Considering the different feature columns, I doubt that current LLMs can truly understand the numeric feature values and their relative relation. \n- The language interfacing requires column feature names. In many tabular data, feature names may not have meaningful semantics such as an abbreviation. It would be hard for LLMs to understand those features."

Specifically, one major drawback of class imbalance in tabular data is that the minority data is not sufficient to help learn a good predictor. In order to solve this problem, the authors propose to leverage the language model to synthesize minority data. Specifically, there are three major parts, first, the minorities are generated by conditioning on their class labels; then, some incorrect examples are rejected through self-authentication; finally, the authors propose an adaptive oversampling by progressively imputation. Through extensive quantitative experiments, the proposed method shows a larger performance improvement than other baseline methods."

It would be better if the quality of the synthesized data could be carefully evaluated. Moreover, how many examples are rejected during self-authentication? It would further improve the quality of this paper if a proper ablation study were conducted.\n- How can different language models influence the performance of the proposed method?
