As I understand, the primary contribution of PACE, as compared to MACE, is the introduction of self-interaction layers that map the atomic base $A_i$ to different subspaces for different body orders, thereby increasing expressive power of PACE. However, the paper lacks an ablation study directly analyzing the significance of this operation. Although MACE could be considered a natural ablative baseline, it's unclear whether the two models share the same hyper-parameters, such as those mentioned in Table 5. I recommend that the authors conduct a direct ablation experiment to clarify this point."

The authors should clarify the logic between these sentences.\n* Considering that all baseline models except MACE possess the universal approximation ability for all equivariant polynomials, it's puzzling why they do not achieve performance comparable to PACE.

                "value": "-  The improvement in the experiments is so marginal. Recent years, people [1] have already noticed that achieving a small energy and force error is only the first step towards a successful neural network force field. The advantage of a neural network force field should be judged on the prediction of macroscopic properties and sampling of conformations on a long-time large-scale molecular dynamic simulation. An improvement on the energy/force error does not necessarily lead to a better MD prediction, unless the improvement is very obvious. Based on the numbers shown in Table 2 and 3, as well as the limit of the datasets, I'm not convinced that the proposed model is a better model than the baselines. Also the proposed model is slower than MACE, making it more useless in applications.\n\n- The theoretical statement in this paper is not very important. Theorem 2 showed that the proposed polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate any polynomial equivariant functions. However, the goal of designing a neural network force field is to develop an end-to-end approximation to potential energy -- which is a non-polynomial equivariant function of the input coordinates. It is already proved that multi-layer perceptrons can already approximate any (polynomial or not) functions by the universal approximation theorem. So, no matter whether the polynomial many-body interaction module can approximate polynomial equivariant functions or not, the entire neural network is a universal approximator for any equivariant functions. This is why I think the value of Theorem 2 is limited."
