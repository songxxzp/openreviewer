It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more robust justification for these choices and consider the feasibility of such attacks in practical applications to ensure a more realistic context for the proposed defense strategy.\n\n2. **(Method)** The paper introduces the concept of storing data as INRs for adversarial robustness, but it lacks clarity on how these representations can be derived for testing data. Given that testing data is typically only accessible during the testing phase, the paper should address the challenge of generating specific INRs for each testing image. For now, I would treat INR as a mere image generator. \n\n3. **(Experiment)** The experimental design in the paper appears to lack fairness, which fails to prove the efficacy of the proposed method. Also, it is unclear if the proposed framework could be used to defend against unseen attacks (e.g., [1]).\n\n\n[1] Perceptual adversarial robustness: Defense against unseen threat models.

                "value": "This paper investigates the problem of adversarial attacks in a new threat model designed around Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). INRs are a new family of data representations where each data point is represented via neural networks. To this end, often an MLP is used to overfit a data point. Then, the MLP weights can be used instead of each data point. Examples of INRs used in real applications include 2D images and 5D radiance fields (NeRFs).\n\nIn this context, this paper argues that INRs can be used to transmit data points between users, and as such, are prone to adversarial manipulation. In particular, an adversary might add a perturbation to the image data _before_ being encoded as INR, or they may opt to manipulate the INR weights _during transmission_. The former is called \"attack during creation\" while the latter is named \"attack during transmission.\"\n\nThe paper presents a formulation for generating each of these attacks. Specifically, a projected gradient descent (PGD) attack is used to generate adversarial perturbations for attack during creation. Then, this adversarial example is encoded via an INR. Also, for attack during transmission a double projection gradient descent (DPGD) is used to ensure that while INR manipulation fools the downstream classifier, it generates attacks that are imperceptible in the image domain. Empirical evaluations indicate that both of these attacks are effective against CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets.\n\nFinally, as a potential defense against these attacks, the paper proposes to make the INR representation of the data robust to manipulation, resulting in an algorithm dubbed \"defense in creation.\" To this end, the paper proposes a new objective function for creating the INR representation of the data by adding a regularization term. This term aims to add perturbations to the INR during creation while ensuring that these changes have minimal effect on the downstream classification task. Empirical results indicate that this strategy is helpful in making INRs robust to adversarial attacks."

The paper starts its discussion by arguing that adversarial training is hard to deploy. The paper reads: \"_Despite its effectiveness, adversarial training requires that users possess a detailed understanding of training settings._\" In my view, this argument can even be used for using vanilla neural networks. One can make the same argument that even for using/training regular neural networks users need a detailed understanding of model architecture, optimization process, etc. There is no major differences that separates adversarial training from vanilla training, and I feel that motivating the core problem around such arguments is weak.\n\n2. More importantly, the threat model is not intuitive. In particular, the paper assumes that one uses the INRs to encode the data, then send them to a model, which again decodes the INR to query a classifier. Why this process is efficient? Why the user doesn't send their data directly? What is special about this threat model? I believe that the proposes threat model is not making intuitive sense, and it requires a better design. For instance, using NeRF to encode a scene and then transmitting it would have made a much better threat model as NeRFs are encoding multiple scenes in one representation. However, using the current threat model for 2D images seems less intuitive and might not make any practical sense.\n\n- The empirical evaluations are also limited. The paper only uses small scale datasets such as CIFAR and SVHN. It would be crucial to see how the proposed attacks and defense work in more large scale datasets such as ImageNet. Given that there are many pre-trained models available for the ImageNet dataset online, I believe that such evaluations would be feasible."

                "value": "- Please clarify what do you mean by arguments like \"_our setup is rooted in the reality that many model users often fail to understand the settings associated with adversarial training._\"\n\n- Given that $\\ell_p$ norms are used to enforce visual image similarity in the image domain, its use for other domains such as INR weights seems less intuitive. What are other alternatives for the similarity in the weight space that could have been used? In other words, are there any other alternatives to the $\\ell_p$ norm used in Eq. (3)?\n\n- What do you mean by $||\\hat{I}\\_{t-1}+\\nabla-\\hat{I}\\_{\\mathrm{org}}||_p \\leq \\zeta$? Is this a typo?\n\n- It would be nice to add a few more sentences to the last paragraph of Section 3.2 explaining why projecting the gradient of the image space would help with having a better image quality. In other words, what motivated this step?\n\n- What is the training time difference between finding an INR using Eq. (1) versus the defense in creation in Eq. (4)?\n\n- Did the paper also test the transferability of the defense in creation? In other words, what happens if we find the robust INRs for a classifier $g\\_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}^{(1)}$ while trying to defend another model $g\\_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}}^{(2)}$ during inference?\n\n- Run experiments on large scale datasets such as ImageNet-1k or ImageNet-100.\n\n- How do you specify the upper-bound for adversarial attack against INR weights? In other words, what makes a good $\\delta$ for Eq. (3)? Because using $\\ell_p$ norm in the INR weight space is not intuitive.\n\n- In my view, using attack success rate (ASR) would be a better measure when trying to evaluate attacks. Using accuracy as the current version makes it difficult to interpret the results.\n\n- How is it possible that the natural accuracies in Table 2 are 100%?\n\n- Use a larger font size for the tables."
