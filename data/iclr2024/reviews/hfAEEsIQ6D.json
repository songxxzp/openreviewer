Only minor clarification questions (below).\n\n# significance\nThe primary weakness is the technique is only compared to a single prior effort.

Looking at RGSK this result is not clear: the $2^20$ result for t=1 is quite close to mix for t=1. For TORCS the mix results are more clearly better (modulo the lack of any estimate of uncertainty).\n\t- Better results on 1 of 2 cases evaluated (TORCS) is not very strong evidence for superiority of the method. Perhaps this would be stronger with evidence from Atari as well?\n- Figure 3:\n\t- As with table 1, is it possible to add uncertainty estimates to the results presented?\n\t- The results on probabilistic similarity again show clear results for TORCS, but more ambiguous outcomes for RGSK. Lacking any confidence intervals, the results in RGSK look very close to one another for all methods.\n\t- Is it possible the dataset is the root cause of these issues? TORCS is from AI agents, which may be easier to classify in style than humans (though it's not obvious a priori why this would be true).\n- Figure 4: What are the shaded areas?"

Incorporating the Bhattacharyya distance is fine, but the connections made to human psychology are a bit flimsy. Additionally, the \"Playstyle Similarity\" metric is ad-hoc (which is isn't inherently bad); it's also not immediately clear to me (or at least it wasn't argued) if it's a metric, as the product of two metrics isn't a metric in general.\n- Given the above points, the experimental section is not substantive enough. While the authors compare Playstyle Distance against their various improvements, they use classification accuracy to compare. However, taking a step back---this is now just a supervised learning problem. Why are any of these needed at all? If the _actual_ task is playstyle classification, then algorithms need to be compared against supervised learning approaches. \n- While I appreciate the fact that code was provided, there weren't good instructions in the supplementary material zip file.

(2021) did find pixel-identical screens\"?\n-  In a different scenario, when treating each state as equivalent, we can invariably pinpoint an intersection state. - Relates to identical, not just equivalent?\n- Unclear what exactly is new in Sec. 3.1 and what was introduced as part of HDS (Lin et al. (2021)).\n- While distance is a common metric for determining similarity, a larger distance value conveys primarily that two entities are different, without giving much insight into the degree of their similarity - Why doesn't a larger distance relates to a smaller degree of similarity?\n- Drawing from the concept of similarity, we can infer that a smaller distance provides more definitive information about the similarity - Needs to be explained.\n- General wording: \"intersecting states/samples\" suggest a partial equivalence of a single state/sample. E.g. \"intersecting set of states/samples\" could be more appropriate. This is especially relevant, because the HSD model can be used to defined a intersection over (single) states (based on the hierarchy), and therefore the concepts are not clearly distinguishable.\n- Sec 4.2.: \"Space size\" seems not to be introduced - probably number of discrete states?\n- To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed multiscale state space and to compare it fairly with Playstyle Distance, we primarily focus on the TORCS and RGSK platforms - Needs to be explained.\n- In this section, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of various metrics, including leveraging full data with union operations. - Seems to state, that state samples from all games are used as a single set?\n\nBesides these clarity issues, the experimental Section could use some improvements:\n- This is based on the assumption that variations in game content can be interpreted as different states - This statement was not empirically evaluated?\n- The \"game-merging\" study in Sec 5.3. is an interesting piece of additional information, but the per-game results are potentially more relevant. The results should be added to the main paper and in case of space constraints, one may think about rank metrics or a table with just the most interesting dataset sizes.\n- Why was Playstyle Similarity not evaluated in Sec. 5.2? \n- Most importantly, additional comparison baselines from related work should be added. E.g. clustering or supervised methods should be applicable.\n- The evaluation is only performed via classification, but a similarity metric should preserve a distance relation beyond \"Top-1\". Therefore, a ranking/continuous study should be performed. E.g. by creating or ordering existing playstyles along a continuous spectrum (like passive/aggressive driving) and evaluating the correlation.\n- Sec 5.2 a, b has nearly indistinguishable intervals. A tabular presentation or non-linear graph scaling should be used to improve clarity.\n\nOverall, the evaluation is still strong, but additional baselines and per-game results would greatly contribute to its value. The contribution was only deemed fair, mostly because the work does only modify an existing idea and the topic is quite niche."

This aids in pinpointing distinct playstyles and understanding the diversity of human behaviors within these games. The work enhances existing methods, particularly the Playstyle Distance technique, by modifying this approach. This traditional method involves an initial discretization of the state space, followed by a comparison of action distributions based on these discrete states using a wasserstein distance. The authors propose three advancements. Firstly, they introduce multiscale states, a refined discretization technique that uses a combination of mappings rather than just one. Secondly, they use the Bhattacharyya distance as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance, arguing that the former aligns more with human perception. Lastly, the authors use the Jaccard index to weight the distance when comparing conditional action distributions across intersecting states in both reference and analyzed datasets, ensuring a more accurate assessment of the intersection's significance. The researchers conducted experiments on three distinct games: two racing games and a collection of Atari games. When compared with various versions of the Playstyle Distance, their proposed methodology appears more proficient. It more effectively captures similarities, leading to a more accurate identification of players."

The paper's objective seems to be playstyle identification based on a few gameplay samples by comparing them with reference datasets,, but the experiments are more about player identification. While understanding the need for reference datasets for different playstyles, the creation and existence of these references remain ambiguous. A discussion on this would be beneficial.\nMoreover, the assumption is that the more the distributions of actions are different, the further the playstyles are. But is it really waht defines playstyle? What about identifying playstyles that are only different in very few states (for instance, two chess players that are using two different openings). Since the definition of palystyle provided here is not grounded on any concrete application, it is difficult to understand the relevance of the work.\n\nSecond, the approach hinges on discretizing the state space. While states are assumed to be continuous and actions discrete, how would this apply when actions are also continuous, as seen in many games? The method's efficacy seems tied to the state discretization's capability to reflect genuine state distances. This might work for pixel-based games, but what about more structured observations, like chess? The multiscale approach's specifics, including the number of mapping functions and their selection, are unclear, yet these details likely influence the outcome significantly.\n\nLast, the approach is an unsupervised method and is evaluated on very few use-cases. It makes it difficult to understand if the proposed approach is good 'in general' or if the choices made by the authors have been 'over-fitted' on the three single use cases they propose. The paper lacks a real dataset captured from real video games, with complex states, actions, and many more players than what is in the article. \n\nIf the contribution sounds right and improves over existing publications, the validation does not allow us to conclude if the approach is really good for identifying playstyles or not. The article lacks a clear definition of what a playstyle is, and why identifying playstyles is interesting. While the subject may appeal to a niche audience, particularly those in the video game research community  (e.g Cog conference), it might not meet the broader criteria for acceptance at ICLR"
