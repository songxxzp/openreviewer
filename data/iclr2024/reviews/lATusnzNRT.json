To execute the over-smoothing injection attack, the attacker is required to compute the singular value of the adjacency matrix during each update iteration. As pointed out by the authors, when dealing with large-scale graphs, this can lead to prohibitively long computation times. Furthermore, in their experiments, the authors claim that they utilized the large-scale graph \"Computers,\" consisting of about 14k nodes. However, this dataset may not qualify as a genuinely large-scale dataset; it can only be categorized as a small or medium-scale dataset. \n\nMoreover, given that OSI is designed to enhance the attack capabilities of existing GIA methods (e.g., TDGIA and AGIA), if OSI proves unsuitable for large-scale datasets (e.g., OGB-arxiv), its practical significance might be limited.\n\n3.

                "value": "1. This paper proposes two objectives: one is to minimize the largest singular value of the normalized adjacency matrix, while the other is to maximize the lowest singular value. Therefore, the essential objective is to decrease the difference between the non-zero singular value of the adjacency matrix. Consider an extreme case where all the non-zero singular value of the normalized adjacency matrix is the same, i.e., $\\mathbf{\\hat{A}} = \\mathbf{U} \\lambda \\mathbf{I} \\mathbf{V}^T$. Since the normalized adjacency matrix is symmetric (in GCN), $\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{V}$, hence $\\mathbf{\\hat{A}} = \\lambda \\mathbf{I}$. It doesn't seem to be a good idea for me to make the adjacency matrix approach an identity matrix. Can the authors explain it to me?\n2. This paper adds a constraint that the output representations for the original nodes are supposed to be as similar as possible, even if those nodes belong to different classes. It may severely decrease the natural accuracy of the original nodes. An effective graph attack should maintain the performance (ACC) for those clean nodes while increasing the attack success rates. Can the authors explain how OSI can ensure natural accuracies and also give experiment results of accuracies on clean nodes?\n3. The theoretical analysis is based on linear GCN and thus proposes FSR and PSR. It seems to be a strong assumption of linearity since the performance of linear GCN and nonlinear GCN is quite different.\n\nAll the above weaknesses are listed in the order of decreasing priority."

                "value": "1. In this paper, the authors claim that OSI can make *'the degree distribution more similar to the power-law distribution'*. This conclusion is not very easy for me to accept. I'm more inclined to regard it as a coincidence due to the dataset and the attack methods. Can the authors provide a more detailed explanation or theoretical analysis?\n2. The OSI is used for untargeted attacks, i.e., decreasing the natural accuracy of target nodes. Can OSI be adaptive to targeted attacks, i.e., predicting the class of target nodes as the target class?\n3. This paper does not clearly explain the relationship between injected nodes and target nodes. Is the target nodes the 1-hop neighbor of injected nodes? If so, it seems to be necessary to show that injected nodes will not affect the prediction of their 2-hop or 3-hop neighbors (clean nodes), as I mentioned in Weakness 2.\n\n\nAll the above questions are listed in the order of decreasing priority."
