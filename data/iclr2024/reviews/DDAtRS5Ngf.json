These models embed inputs like images, text, and audio into a shared embedding space. The attack involves making small perturbations to an input, like an image, so that its embedding becomes very close to a completely different, adversary-chosen input in another modality, like text. This fools downstream tasks relying on the embeddings, as they now interpret the perturbed input based on the adversary's target instead of the original semantics. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack. The authors also discuss potential defenses like adversarial training and certifications. Overall, the work demonstrates serious vulnerabilities in cross-modal alignment of current multi-modal embeddings."

The adversarial perturbation is really visible in Figure 7, leveraging diffusion models could improve the attack. \n\t- Why using the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm? Have the authors experimented with other norms (e.g. $\\ell_2$)?\n\n- The authors seem to have experimented only with cross-modality? Can the authors create adversarial illusions on the same modality? \n- Is it possible to investigate the transferability of the attack?  e.g. against other multimodal foundation models? \n- The authors seem to be experimenting only with targeted attacks. Would it be possible to maximize the following loss: \n$$\n\\ell = 1 - \\cos\\left( \\theta^{m_1}(x^{m_1}+\\delta), \\theta^{m_1}(x^{m_1}) \\right)\n$$\n\n\n**Other comments:**\n- What is the difference between figures 1,3,4,5? It seems only the modality and examples are different. These figures take up a lot of space in the paper, I think these figures could be reduced or some of them could be put in the appendix to leave space for further experiments. \n- The authors devote a whole section to countermeasures, but it seems that they do not do any experiments. If the authors focus so much on countermeasures, some experiments should be done. \n\nXue et al. Diffusion-Based Adversarial Sample Generation for Improved Stealthiness and Controllability"

For instance, images and mel spectrograms can still be misclassified into the target input by introducing specific noises calculated by SimBA[2]. Some further clarification regarding the limitations or inapplicability of black-box attacks in this context would be helpful.\n- Are the other white-box attacks as effective as I-FGSM in performing adversarial illusions?\n- The experiments are conducted using ImageBind, a model that is contrastively pre-trained and projects all modality data into an image embedding space. If ImageBind were replaced with a multi-modal model like ChatBridge[3], which is not contrastively pre-trained and projects all modality data into a text embedding space, would this still demonstrate the vulnerability of multi-modal embeddings to the adversarial illusion attack?\n- In Figure 5, could you please clarify why the target input, a sheep image, is encoded by a text encoder rather than an image encoder?\n- (Minor) Is the I-FGSM formula complete? I think a clipping operation is missing in it.\n- (Minor) I find it a bit confusing whether unCLIP can be used as a generative model. In the \"Downstream models\" section of Section 2, the paper mentions that \"diffusion models that operate on CLIP embeddings, e.g., unCLIP, can also operate on ImageBind embeddings.\" However, in Section 6, the paper also notes that BindDiffusion, which employs the unCLIP model, struggles to generate images from the multi-modal embeddings. Some clarification on this apparent discrepancy would be appreciated.\n\n[2] Chuan Guo, Jacob R. Gardner, Yurong You, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Kilian Q. Weinberger. Simple Black-box Adversarial Attacks.
