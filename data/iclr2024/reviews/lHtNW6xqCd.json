Therefore, it proposes to learn the residual between probabilities, which is easier. Theoretical analysis is provided to discuss the estimation performance and generalization performance.

However, after reading this paper, it seems that this paper studies a specific type of label noise, which is a weak version of instance-dependent label noise. Specifically, the paper proposes first to learn a global transition matrix and learn the residual term with respect to each instance. This holds only when the noise patterns of different instances are similar. \n- The previous work [R1] employs a similar idea. However, [R1] is not discussed. \n\n**On theoretical analysis**\n- The analysis highly relies on neural tangent kernels. It is somewhat less general for me.\n- For Theorem 2, when the sample size $n$ approximates $+\\infty$, the error is not zero. It depends on the parameter $\\epsilon$. \n- Condition 1 is not very reasonable. It needs the network parameter to be zero at the beginning of training. It is not very practical. \n\n\n**On writing**\n- In the \u201cIntroduction\u201d, the definitions of $Y$ and $X$ should be provided.\n- This paper argues that compared to traditional transition matrix methods for class-dependent label noise, the proposed method does not require much additional time consumption. However, I do not find strong evidence about this claim.\n- The notation $-\\top$ is a bit confusing. \"Inverse + Transpose\"?\n- Why using $u$ and $v$? It is confusing for me. \n- Could the proposed method be boosted by semi-supervised learning methods, e.g., DivideMix, for better performance?\n----\n[R1] Shikun Li et al.

                "value": "1.\tI feel that the high-level idea of this paper is a bit similar to T-revision (Are anchor points really indispensable in label-noise learning? NIPS 19). In T-revision, the authors propose to learn \\deltaT which is imposed to transition matrix T. In this paper, the authors aim to learn \\gamma(X) imposed on T^{\\top}*P(Y|X). Note that these two formations are actually the same, if we let \\gamma(X)=\\deltaT*P(Y|X). In other words, both methods aim to learn a residual term to correct the original estimation. Therefore, I feel that the authors need to clarify the essential difference between the two methods.  \n2.\tOne selling point of this proposed method is that it can handle different types of noise, especially instance-dependent noise, as claimed by the authors. After investigating the model, I think such merits mainly come from the term \\gamma(X). However, l cannot fully understand why introducing such term can enable the method to deal with various noise types. The authors claim that they impose sparsity to \\gamma(X) to achieve this target, but why? What is the relationship of sparsity with the noise types, especially instance-dependent label noise? I think such rationale is neither clear nor straightforward enough.\n3.\tEven the formulation (5) is correct, the authors decompose \\gamma(X) into N pairs of {u_i, v_i}. Then the problem comes. I notice that no regularization is imposed to {u_i, v_i}, how to guarantee its identifiability, uniqueness, or even optimality? Note that the identifiability of T is very important for label noise learning, and the identifiability of {u_i, v_i} is actually very related to it.\n4.\tThe authors might misused the terms \u201csample\u201d and \u201cexample\u201d, which confused me a lot when I read the paper at the first time. Note that their meanings are totally different. I think most of the term \u201csample\u201d should be \u201cexample\u201d in this paper. \n5.\tThe notion \u201cdiagonally dominant\u201d is not correctly used in this paper. Note that when we say a c*c matrix T is diagonally dominant, it means T_ii>|T_i1|+|T_i2|+\u2026|T_i,i-1| +|T_i,i+1| +|T_ic| mathematically, rather than T_ii>T_ij for j \\neq i.\n6.\tThe experimental results reveal that sometimes the accuracy of the proposed method is very similar to baseline methods. Therefore, I think statistical significance analysis is needed to justify the real superiority of the proposed method to baseline methods."

Comparing the results of a model using ResNet-18 as its backbone (TMR) with another using ResNet-34 (SOP) may not provide a fair comparison, especially given the capacity and potential performance differences between the two architectures. It becomes even more noteworthy if the TMR model with a ResNet-18 outperforms the SOP model with a ResNet-34 by a significant margin.
