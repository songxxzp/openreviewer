                "value": "The paper introduces MI-NeRF, a novel approach to learn a single dynamic neural radiance field (NeRF) from monocular videos of talking faces across multiple identities. The core innovation is the incorporation of a multiplicative module that distinguishes between identity and expression information, inspired by TensorFaces. By simultaneously training on multiple videos, MI-NeRF significantly cuts training time while achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks like facial expression transfer and talking face video synthesis."

                "value": "1. The proposed MI-NeRF robustly adapts to unseen expressions and identities, requiring minimal retraining, thereby saving computational time and effort.\n2. The Multiplicative module in MI-NeRF effectively separates identity from expression, ensuring consistent identity portrayal even with dynamic expressions, a challenge for some other models.\n3. MI-NeRF achieves superior performance in visual quality and lip synchronization, making it a leading solution in realistic talking face synthesis."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Here are some concerns:\n\n1. The paper utilizes learnable latent codes to capture time-varying information. However, there's a potential ambiguity regarding how the model ensures these codes don't inadvertently encode identity or expression information. A more rigorous analysis or mechanism would have been beneficial to validate that these latent codes truly only represent unique, time-varying elements without overlapping with identity and expression descriptors.\n\n2. Maintaining consistency in novel views is inherently tied to the accurate modeling of 3D information. When MI-NeRF constructs facial identities and expressions over time, it is imperative for it to ensure that these reconstructions remain consistent and accurate, even when viewed from unseen angles. This is not merely a question of aesthetics, but of the system's fidelity to real-world dynamics. Without evaluation or visualization of its ability to maintain this consistency, one could question its versatility and applicability in varied real-world settings.\n\n3. Some concerns regarding the dataset:\ni) The collected videos lead to concerns about data privacy and the feasibility of public release. Ethical considerations surrounding personal data must be paramount. And will the authors be able or allowed to release the data?\nii) Within 140 videos, It's unclear how many unique individuals are represented and whether multiple videos pertain to the same person. Additionally, questions arise regarding the consistency of identity codes across different videos during training.\niii) The steps taken to prepare the data before its integration into MI-NeRF are essential. Without clear details about preprocessing, it's challenging to replicate results or trust the dataset's integrity.\n\n4. While the research highlights the limitations of the GAN-based method, Wav2Lip, it doesn't delve deeply into how MI-NeRF stands compared to other recent state-of-the-art GAN approaches. \n\n5. MI-NeRF's uniqueness largely stems from its multiplicative module. However, this also means the model's overall success heavily depends on this single component. If the module faces challenges in complex real-world scenarios, the entire model's performance could be compromised. A deeper discussion about the potential limitations of this module would be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of its robustness."

Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that the proposed multiplicative structure helps disentangling the identity and expression.

The method shouldn't be hard for any readers to re-implement.  \n\nAblation studies show the multiplicative structure is well designed, and each piece of it can help improve the factor disentanglement and visual quality.
