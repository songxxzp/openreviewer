                "value": "The paper introduces sparse training in deep learning, aiming to replace fully connected neural networks with ultra-sparse ones inspired by brain networks. They propose Epitopological Sparse Meta-deep Learning (ESML) using Cannistraci-Hebb learning theory. ESML learns ultra-sparse hyperbolic topologies, showcasing meta-deep organization. Empirical experiments reveal ESML's ability to automatically sparse neurons through percolation. Cannistraci-Hebb training (CHT) is introduced and compared with fully connected networks on VGG16 and ResNet50. CHT acts as a gradient-free oracle, guiding link placement for sparse-weight gradient learning. It introduces parsimony dynamic sparse training by retaining performance through percolation and reducing node network size."
