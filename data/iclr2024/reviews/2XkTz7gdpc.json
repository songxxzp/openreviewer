To achieve this, the authors sequentially coarse a graph via graph partition to obtain a sequence of intermediate graphs towards a single-node graph. The graph generation is basically reversing this process, starting from a single node graph and gradually do expansion and refinement towards the original full graph. What's more, each step of the graph refinement for reverting graph coarsen is modeled with denoising diffuison model, while all steps share the same parameters of denoising diffusion model. To establish and concretize this graph coarsen & graph expansion idea, the authors also study and optimize the orderings of coarsen and expansion (spectrum preserving graph coarsen), the underlying diffusion model used (SDE with pre-conditioning and self-conditioning), and also the network architecture (local PPGN to utilize sparsity while retain certain expressivity). The authors demonstrate the improved performance on several (small) plain-graph datasets, and two datasets with larger graphs."

The presentation in general is easy to follow, with minor problems that I will point out later. \n4. The authors designed an experiment of testing extrapolation and interpolation shows the great strength of sequentially expansion over one-shot generation, which is interesting and shows that the designed method is promising. \n5. The authors provide detailed configuration of hyperparameters, good for reader to check. \n6.

It would be great if the author can provide more detailed ablation study to guide the audience the importance of each design choice. \n2. For designed method depends on random orderings of graph coarsen and the reverse ordering of graph expansion. One shortcoming is that the designed method can be sensitive to orderings. The second shortcoming is that the method may needs a longer training period to converge comparing with one-shot generation, and I wish the author to discuss this. \n3. To follow up the previous shortcoming, I have noticed that the author only test the designed method over datasets with really limited number of graphs. I concern whether the training time increased due to the sequential coarsen and randomness of coarsen ordering can be too large for a dataset with large number of graphs. For example, typical molecule datasets can have millions of graphs inside. If the designed method has too much improved training cost, then it is not applicable to these real-world cases. Hence, I strongly suggest the author introduce additional datasets instead of just these small datasets. (small = limited number of graphs in the dataset) \n4. Decomposition of joint distribution, cannot be sum over all conditional likelihood. Instead should sum over P(G|order) x P(order). Similar issue inside equation 2, equation 3. These parts need a revision. \n5. The equation after eq.1 combines two independent distributions together, which uses less information to predict v_l, and can lead to error. This is because that edges being refined can be very important for identifying which node is expected to expand. \n6. The equation above (3) is essentially importance sampling, which needs the condition that support of distribution is covered all possible ordering (prob >0 for all orderings)."

I'm concerning whether this leads to increased computation burden comparing with one-shot generation. \n3. When you use eigenvectors, why use SignNet? It is sign invariant representation, should be bad for edge prediction task. It should only be good for graph-level tasks. \n4. Can you provide more discussion over the choice of ordering of graph coarsen and graph expansion? From equation 1-3 they seem to play an important role. From your experimental result, how sensitive is the the ordering for generation quality? \n5. Can you provide result on molecular datasets? At least a relative small one QM9 should be considered.\n6. For one-shot generation, you have set the number of inference steps to be 1000, while for you each intermediate step needs 256 inference steps. Can you provide the total inference steps you used? Are this significantly larger than 1000? In the meantime, a fair comparison should use relatively same number of steps."

                "value": "1) While the paper introduces a hierarchical and multiscale graph generation approach, it fails to acknowledge and compare it to previous methods [1, 2, 6] with similar objectives. For instance, HiGen [2] employs a hierarchical generation scheme, iteratively un-coarsing graphs and generating subgraphs in a coarse-to-fine manner with state-of-the-art quality. A hierarchical normalizing flow model for molecular graphs is also ignored [1], where new molecular graphs are generated by inverting edge contraction coarsening and duplicating node attributes after each expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\n2) The method maintains a  constant  number of eigenvalues $k$ (principal Laplacian spectrum) in the expansion process, which means that a fixed global structure of rank $k$ is used while the graph size is growing. On the other hand, since a local PPGN focuses on the local dense subgraph, therefore such *spectrum preserving local expansion* method may not capture some details that lie in the gap between the principal Laplacian spectrum (fixed global structure of the graph) and the local subgraphs. This can limit the model expressivity for larger graphs where this gap is larger.\n\n3) It lacks a comprehensive complexity analysis, despite claiming sub-quadratic complexity. It is essential to compare the sampling times to recent scalable graph generation models. Furthermore, there is no visualization of the generated graphs, which is crucial for assessing the quality of the model's output.\n\n4) The paper falls short in evaluating the generation quality by not comparing it to recent methods such as HiGen [2], GraphARM [3], and EDGE [4]. In particular, the performance on the Tree dataset is only compared against two benchmarks. It is also recommended to include the evaluation of the proposed model using random GNNs based on [5] as an alternative evaluation method to provide a more comprehensive assessment.\n \n5) The paper's presentation requires improvement to enhance its readability. \n\n-  a) Notations can be confusing, with some instances of the same notation used for different terms. For instance, distinguishing the expansion vector $\\mathbf{v}$ from nodes using different notation and handling variations in symbols such as $\\mathit{\\Pi}$ and $\\Pi$ would be beneficial. Additionally, the dual use of $\\theta$ for representing both the distribution over coarsening sequences and model parameters in section 3.3 may lead to confusion. \n\n- b) Contraction family and contraction function are both denoted by $\\mathcal{F}(G)$ while the family need not be a function of input graphs. \n\n- c) The paper should be improved for self-containment and clarity. For example, \u201cwe found that the formulation proposed by Song et al. (2021), supplemented with enhancements from Karras et al. (2022), yielded the most promising results, similarly to the approach used in Yan et al. (2023)\u201d is very vague and one need to read the appendix. Also, a significant portion of the crucial model components is pushed to the appendix. \n\n- d) The paper employs the term \"autoregressive\" to describe the model, which might cause confusion. In section 2, it's mentioned that \"one-shot generative models have generally outperformed autoregressive ones.\" To avoid confusion, it's advisable to use more accurate terminology, such as \"recursive\" or \"iterative,\" to distinguish the model's nature.\n\n- e) The factorization mentioned at the bottom of page 4, based on the chain rule, should explicitly note the assumption of a Markov property in the expansion sequence, i.e., $P(G_{l-1} | G_l, G_{l+1}, \u2026, G_{L} ) = P(G_{l-1} | G_l)$.

                "value": "1) It seems that the model is using two iterative processes: an outer process to expand a graph ($G_l -> G_{l-1}$) and an inner process that uses a denoising diffusion model at each $ l $? . It would be helpful to provide a clear explanation of these processes, especially in the context of using the one-shot method.\n\n2) Should the likelihood of a graph G presented before eq (1) be marginalized as:\n$P(G) = \\sum P(G|\\omega)p(\\omega)$? \n\nAlso, it seems more suitable to rather define it as marginalized over the coarsening sequences\n$P(G) = \\sum P(G|\\pi)p(\\pi)$\nAlso, in the first equation in variational interpretation, it is defined as marginalization over the a contraction family not all possible contraction sequences so it might be corrected by the upper bound:\n$P(G) \\ge \\sum_{\\pi in \\Pi_{F}} P(G|\\pi)p(\\pi)$\n\n3) Why do we need a multilevel coarsening scheme that ensures preservation of the Laplacian spectrum? Is this particular property a key to the model, or could other coarsening methods also be utilized which preserve global structures by explicitly preserving approximate Laplacian spectrum?\n\n4) In the footnote of page 5, an example is given for the expansion sequences that are not the reverse of any coarsening sequence. Are there other cases, or can the refinement step be restricted to ensure the refined graph remains connected?\n\n5) It would be valuable to elaborate on why this  added source of randomness in the expansion is beneficial to the model's performance.\n\n\n6) What was the range of $L$ in each dataset and what family of contractions did you use? Did you limit $L$? In the case $L=1$, is this method (one-shot) equivalent to one of the already available non-multiscale diffusion models in the literature such as Yan et al. (2023)?\n\n7) How the denoising process is focused on the local subgraphs details, did you only add noise to a subset of the edges at each diffusion step?"
