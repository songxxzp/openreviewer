            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "While the experiments are cool and thorough, and while the framing of the optimization problem is coherent, the paper diminishes itself by its framing. *This is an addressable issue* and the reviewer thinks it can be straightforwardly, especially during a rebuttal period, as it's not an experimental thing. The framing issue is that it oversells itself in a way that misleads the reader. \n\nI think a good principle of academia (that we can all reasonably agree with) is to only assert what we can reasonably back-up and to not mislead. This paper does not provide a numerical solution to optimal transport or the schrodinger bridge. In the introduction, it casts OT and Schrodinger Bridge as edge-cases of their variational problem. *However, they do not provide an actual solution to that variational problem*. The statement of this problem has been well known. The **application** of it in the context of generative modeling and dynamical systems is compelling (even if approximate! you don't need to solve OT/SB to do cool control!) but it does not need to be couched as if it is solving those problems. It is still compelling to say \"we came up with an approximate way to do stochastic optimal control in the context of deep generative modeling\" without saying \"we have provided a variational method for solving optimal transport and SB.\"\n\nThe issue is that the constraint (6b) is actually quite hard to enforce. The Gaussian approximation is fine. But the authors should really be careful in stating what it is they are doing and how it relates to the problem they are seeking to solve, because gaussian paths are not going to do it. The paper that this one primarily cites (Flow Matching for Generative Modeling) seems to do this too -- in which it specifies an \"optimal transport path\" that isn't actually providing a means to solve OT.\n\nThe reason the reviewer stresses this point is two-fold: the first is that mathematicians have spent many years carefully characterizing the hardness of these problems and approximate solutions without overstating them. The second is that doing this induces confusion to new readers who come into the field. This is a damaging effect, it muddles points and slows down new members, and one the reviewer has already had to deal with from students misinterpreting the claims of OT in these types of papers.\n\nThis can be addressed by simply toning down some of claims, and including these caveats, e.g. in the bullet points on page two summarizing the papers contributions.\n\n**References**\n\nThere are some necessary adjustments to the citations needed, but that can be cleared up. Here are some things that should be addressed:\n\n- At the beginning of section 3.1: Neither [Liu 2023b] nor [Peluchetti 2022] propose any sort of entropic optimal transport. Perhaps there was a typo in the citep. While Liu 2023b proposes a procedure for OT (when the iterating field is a gradient field), nothing about it is entropic.\n- There seems to be some missing citations with regards to the matching algorithms. On page one following the line \"a mixture of tractable conditional probability paths (Ho, Song, Lipman)\" should include [1,2,3] listed below. These should likewise be included Bridge and Flow matching (explicit) section. There is also related follow-up work by Tong et al listed as [4]\n- The Schrodinger Bridge problem in the introduction should not be attributed to the machine learners. It's been studied for decades. The original citation is provided in [5], and a follow-up is provided in [6]. \n\n\n**Other adjustments**\n- The discussion about feasibility seems not so useful. The statement of the problem the paper wants to solve is that the solution is feasible (it's chicken-egg). That's the point of a constraint in an optimization problem. If the one paper the authors want to compare this work to (the Generalized Schrodinger Bridge one) fails to meet this, it doesn't seem worth taking the reader down that line when the problem statement assumes it. Table 1 could be in an appendix :) \n- There are some minor things throughout the text to adjust, which are semantically inexact. For example: in the line in the \"Implicit action matching\" paragraph:  \"...then the unique gradient field $\\nabla s^\\theta_t(X_t)$ that matches $p_t$ can be obtained by minimizing...\". The noun comparison is wrong here. $\\nabla s^\\theta_t(Xt)$ does not match a probability density. The learning problem is to find the $\\nabla s^\\theta_t(X_t)$ for which the probability density *of the pushforward* from the initial density $p_0$ to $\\tilde p_t$ by this $s_t^\\theta$ matches $p_t$. Densities match densities.\n- The authors should adjust the first paragraph of the second page to highlight that optimal transport as a field does consider a wide variety of other costs besides the $\\mathcal W-2$ cost. There are e.g. repulsive costs, e.g. in the study of quantum dynamics, etc. The notion of optimality still holds.\n- Lastly, are the authors sure that a reasonably different coupling $p(x_0, x_1)$ emerges at the minimizer? Neither set of experiments seems to suggest this. While it is true in the image-to-image translation, that the intermediate density $p_t(x)$ has a more semantically meaningful translation, the marginal endpoints (the $x_0$ associated with $x_1$) for both algorithms look pretty much identical. Moreover, Figure 1 highlights an equivalent picture. The initial and final empirical densities (light green and dark green) are identical even after learning. \n\n\n**The reviewer is more than happy to improve their score if the framing, citations, and \"other adjustments\"**. As of now I would ideally mark this as a 4/10 and not a 5/10, but that isn't an option any more it seems.\n\n[1] Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow.
