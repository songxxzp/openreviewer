                "value": "The authors present a dataset and a deep learning pipeline to decode evoked semantic categories during sleep. They collect a dataset of 64-channel EEG recorded while participants (n=52) were exposed to image and sound stimuli from 15 semantic categories while awake. Following this, participants were re-exposed to a subset of the previous sound stimuli while they were in N2/3 sleep. Deep learning pipelines based on CNNs or Transformers and combining a classification objective and a domain (i.e. awake-image, awake-sound, sleep-sound) adaptation objective were then trained to predict the category of a presented stimulus from the corresponding EEG. Different training and evaluation settings are investigated. Results suggest semantic categories can be decoded significantly above chance performance even during NREM sleep."

See Weaknesses for proposed clarifications.\n\nSignificance: The study appears like an important step towards the understanding and improvement of semantic decoding during sleep. Along with the dataset (when released) this has the potential to effectively become a baseline framework for studying semantic decoding during sleep."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "A core claim of the paper is that the experimental paradigm allows probing memory reactivation during sleep. However, I am not convinced the presented analyses actually allow studying memory reactivation. Rather, the trained neural encoders likely picked up on evoked activity related to the audio stimuli presented during sleep.\n First, the EEG recordings were epoched from -0.2 to 0.8 s around the stimulus onset (Section 4.1). The paper does not describe the distribution of audio stimuli duration, but it is likely that the audio clips lasted a few hundreds of milliseconds. In that case, the EEG windows likely contained evoked responses to these auditory stimuli rather than an associated memory. To assess that, an analysis of the evoked response that also takes into account the spatial dimension would be important (see Q1). On a related note, details of how auditory cues impacted sleep would be important to provide (Q2).\nSecond, I believe the data that was collected during sleep could be used to clarify this point. What kind of decoding performance can be achieved when only looking at auditory cues of mismatched pairs? If semantic category classification performance remains high for cues for which the evoked response should be different from the \u201cmemory-evoked\u201d response (i.e. mismatched pairs), this could support the authors\u2019 claim (see Q3).\nFinally, to further support the claim that the paradigm tests memory reactivation, an analysis of the behavioral responses during the post-sleep session for presented vs. non-presented stimuli could be carried out. A significant increase in performance for stimuli presented during sleep could support the effect of the TMR-like protocol.\nOverall, I believe these questions should be answered for the memory-related claims to be kept in the manuscript.\n\nThe description of the models in the Appendix is a bit confusing (see Q4). Summarizing the entire architecture (i.e. including more than just the Conv layers in the table) would be helpful. Also, a single description of the \u201cSubject block\u201d might be clearer (instead of having two separate tables that appear to contain the same information)."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. What do the evoked responses look like? It would be important to provide descriptive analyses of the time-locked response to images, auditory cues and auditory cues during N2/3 to confirm the validity of the collected data. Importantly, do time-locked responses during sleep follow a different temporal pattern that maybe spans a longer window (as memory reactivation might happen after the stimulus presentation)? Moreover, considering the spatial dimension of the evoked response (i.e. how it is distributed across the different EEG channels, e.g. with topomaps) might help confirm the responses collected during sleep are actually closer to (awake) auditory or visual responses.\n\n2. Is there a chance the audio cues during N2/3 woke up the participants? Showing examples and/or a summary of sleep staging (e.g. hypnograms showing how N2/3 stages were not interrupted by the cues) would be useful.\n\n3. How does decoding performance during sleep differ for auditory cues coming from matched vs. mismatched pairs? My understanding from Section A2 is that the sleep auditory cues were randomly selected from the whole audio set, meaning there should be examples from both matched and mismatched pairs available. A supplementary figure like Figure 3 could then be used to report the results for both categories. If performance remains as high for auditory cues of mismatched pairs, then the \u201cmemory-replay\u201d hypothesis might be validated.\n\n4. In Section 2.3: \u201cSince there are fewer publicly available EEG recordings during sleep compared to those during wakefulness, applying unsupervised pretraining methods for sleep decoding is not feasible.\u201d I believe that is not true, as there are a lot of openly available sleep datasets (SHHS, MASS, SleepEDF, Physionet Challenge 2018, etc.). My understanding is the limiting factor might be the spatial coverage for those datasets though, which often include a few channels only whereas the presented dataset contains 64 channels.\n\n5. What is the impact of the hyperparameter $\\lambda$ in Equation 2, and how was the value of 0.5 selected in Section 4.2.3?\n\n6. The performance of the Lasso GLM is about the same as the neural decoders in Figure 3c. How does the Lasso GLM fare in the Awake+Sleep \u2192 Sleep setting (Figure 3d)?\n\n7. In Section 4.2.1: \u201cWe take the test accuracy according to the maximum validation accuracy as its performance.\u201d I am not sure I understand what this means.\n\n8. Use of the word \u201cmigration\u201d (e.g. Section 4.2.2): maybe \u201ctransfer\u201d would be clearer and more connected with the literature?"

                "value": "My primary concern in reading the paper is that a core contribution regarding the relative performance of the various models is not supported as well as it could be. In particular, I think we should expect something like performance on awake+sleep+contrastive > awake+sleep > [awake or sleep in whatever order]. This data is all available in plots (Fig 3) but from just eyeballing those plots it's hard to tell whether the sleep->sleep CNN is better or worse than the awake+sleep->sleep CNN, for example. These should ideally be on the same plot. Similarly sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 report some statistics but no comparison to support the core claim above, and there's no results table for these experiments either, unless I have missed something. \n\nSeparately, I have some notation concerns: \n* Is it really that $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^K$, i.e. each label is a vector of real numbers the length of the number of classes? I would think it's $y \\in \\\\{1 \\ldots K\\\\}$ or similar. \n* The $\\mathcal{X}$s aren't explicitly defined. \n* If $\\mathcal{P}(i) = \\\\{k|k\\in \\mathcal{A}(i), y_k = y_i\\\\}$ and $\\mathcal{A}(i)$ is a set of instances $\\\\{x_i, y_i\\\\}$ then $k$ is such an instance and $y_k$ seems overloaded or poorly defined. \n\nThese are just the ones I immediately caught -- another careful proofread of the math might be useful. \n\nFinally, some more unordered comments: \n* I think describing a dataset as \"open set\" is a bit odd (section 2.2) -- a dataset has a fixed number of classes, i.e. it is \"closed set\". In my understanding \"open set\" is a notion w.r.t models / tasks rather than datasets (i.e. ability to classify unseen classes, often by composition of seen classes, the use of a language model, or something else). \n* Kostas et al. 2021 (doi:10.3389/fnhum.2021.653659) is likely worth mentioning in discussion of larger-scale SSL pretraining for EEG.\n* I found Figure 2 more confusing than illustrative -- the caption is doing a lot of explanation and I'm not sure how much the figure adds. For example, the arrows and colors are not used consistently -- it's not obvious what the arrow colors mean, and the arrows seem to indicate data flow in the top part of the figure and an ordering of experiments in the bottom part."

Is that right? If so, maybe this plot's x axis should be the number of instances / hours etc to facilitate direct comparison. \n* The paper takes care to describe its paradigm as \"TMR related\" instead of \"TMR evoked\" because the paradigm is different from TMR -- how is it different?"
