The authors discuss several drawbacks of the independent test method, e.g., HSIC, and show that the randomized dependence coefficient (RDC) has the advantage in measuring the non-linear dependence, based on a set of simulation experiments. Moreover, The authors propose a novel method that incorporates maximal correlation into the PNL model learning (short as MC-PNL) such that the underlying nonlinearities can be accurately recovered. The experiment results verify the ability of non-linear function fitting of the proposed method and show that MC-PNL outperforms the baselines in causal discovery application."

For single-index models, the identifiability of the parameter $\\beta$ will be problematic, and often one assumes $\\beta$ to be on the unit sphere.

Under the assumption that the true model follows the post-nonlinear (PNL) model, prior work does causal discovery by learning the functions f_1,f_2 and then using some dependence measure to compare the dependence between the residuals and the input under both hypotheses. This paper proposes an alternate two-stage method, where the first stage learns the functions using a soft-version of HGR maximal correlation regularized by a dependency measure (Renyi, 1959) and the second stage is an independence test between the residual and the input. The dependency measure regularization is motivated by pointing out the con of maximal correlation that it doesn't provide usable residuals for the downstream independence test. Experimental results show that the proposed method is competitive w.r.t existing methods."

Among a host of different causal disvoery methods compared in Table 2, the proposed method MC-PNL is faster compared to only AB-PNL by 300x, while there exists a competitive method in IGCI that is 60x faster than the proposed method. Overall, the experimental results don't seem to give the impression that MC-PNL outperforms other benchmarks. \n4) While one of the disadvantages of the PNL algorithms is claimed to be the optimization issue, thus motivating the RFF parametrization and linear HSIC kernel, neither is the experimental performance of this variant discussed, nor is its theoretical properties. MC-PNL still uses a gradient-based algorithm for the universal kernel and banded loss regularizer."
