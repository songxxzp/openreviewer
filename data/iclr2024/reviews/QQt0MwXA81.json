                "value": "This paper studies LLMs as potential tools for simulating human behavior in the context of behavioral research. Motivated by previous research showing that human responses can be sensitive to changes in a prompt (e.g., phrasing and format), the paper seeks to explore to what extent LLMs are sensitive to such changes in prompts in that context. To do so the authors present BiasMonkey, a framework consisting of a dataset generation, an LLM response collection, and an LLM response evaluation phase. Dataset collection is achieved by modifying existing questions with the intention to induce response biases (e.g., response order, allow-forbid asymmetry), and also with perturbations that are not bias-inducing (e.g,, letter swap and adding typos) for human respondents. Evaluation is then conducted by comparing the response behavior between an original question and its perturbed counterpart. The authors experiment with Pew Research\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP) set of questions using 7 models based on Llama-2 and GPT-3.5. Experimental results demonstrate that only Llama-2-70B exhibits human-like behavior with respect to directional changes after perturbing prompts. However, the results on non-bias perturbations show that models also change their responses when prompted with such modified questions. Interestingly, the authors demonstrate that chain-of-thought prompting (i.e., asking the model for reasoning about its decision) yields less significant results."

This is a timely and important research question in a time where many researchers are using LLMs as proxies for humans (e.g. \"Discovering language model behaviors ..\", Perez et al. 2022). They propose a framework called BiasMonkey, which prescribes a way for generating question-pairs that can evaluate whether an LLM exhibits a certain bias. For example, humans show bias when the word \"forbidden\" is used, answering differently to *\"Is it ever acceptable for an unmarried couple to live together\"* and *\"Should it be forbidden for an unmarried couple to live together\"*. The authors also generate questions that evaluate whether LLMs show biases where humans don't, e.g. humans usually don't answer differently when letters are swapped, e.g. *\"Overall, do you think science has made life easier or more difficult for most people?\"* versus *\"Ovearll, do you tihnk sicence has made life eaiser or more diffiuclt for most poeple?\"*. They evaluate 7 LLMs with this of which some are instruction-tuned and/or RLHF-ed and others are only pretrained. The findings are that none of the models show biases similar to humans, except LLaMa-70B (base pretrained, not fine-tuned). Most other models that show statistically significant changes for control questions (indicating human-like bias) also show it for non-bias perturbations (like the letter swap), which means the result can be explained by spurious correlations. The conclusion is that we should be careful when using LLMs as human proxies, but LLaMa-70B's results are promising. The authors further validate this result by comparing models with human opinion as measured by wasserstein distance on US survey questions, finding that LLaMa-70B is most aligned."

I would not be surprised if GPT-4 would perform similarly to LLaMa-70B.\n- It would be very useful to indicate significance in table 3 instead of separately in a table where you need to go to see which of the effects are significant in table 3, e.g. with asterisk or something\n- You make several claims about instruction-tuned models without doing a controlled study comparing base models to instruction-tuned counterparts (there are more differences between ChatGPT and LLaMa-2 than instruction-tuning). I am relatively convinced the difference is due to instruction-tuning, also because you do have LLaMa-70B and LLaMa-70b-chat (only difference is instruction tuning), but an interesting addition or direction for future work would be to study the impact of instruction tuning on human-like response biases. For example, could it be that instruction-tuned models are further trained on higher-quality data without typos etc, making them less robust to these kind of examples. Could this also mean that other types of perturbations not involving badly formatted text that humans are not sensitive to would be less of a problem for models?"

It was a pleasure to read.\n- It adds important evidence to the body of work exploring the ability of LMs to simulate humans in responding to surveys and multiple-choice questions. It is well-grounded in former work, showing in most cases where results from this paper agree with other papers, esp. on surprising findings like RLHF'd models being less representative. It also is useful to highlight that humans are biased by framing, in the context of LMs being criticized for requiring prompt engineering.\n- I was glad to see this dataset contain baselines of non-bias perturbations to which humans are robust."

                "value": "- I would be more compelled by the evidence presented here if the questions matched those presented to humans, but it seems to be the case that the questions are generated by a LM. This feels like a weird way to evaluate whether LMs fall prey to same biases that humans do, and the authors don't justify it. Was it because the original questions from social science/psychology/etc. were not available? Wouldn't you want to replicate the result in the distribution of these better-established question pairs than in question pairs where, as I understand it, half of the question pair is natural and the other is generated by a LM to be inflected by the framing which the bias is sensitive to?\n- While I can't find overt problems--the methodology seems neat and sound to me--I think the evidence could be heavier. For example, why did you sample only 50 questions? Why only ATP?"
