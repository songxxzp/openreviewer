                "value": "The paper proposes a new method to empirically estimate the privacy loss of an algorithm, targeted at federated learning. The method can estimate the privacy loss from just one run of the algorithm, which makes it easy to apply. This is done by randomly sampling canary vectors, which are presented to the central aggregator as regular updates. The cosine similarity between each of the canaries and the output of the audited algorithm is then used as a test statistic to infer whether the canary was in the training set or not. The test statistic's distribution, both with or without the canaries, can be approximated with simple Gaussians, as the canaries are likely to be orthogonal to each other and the actual update when the space is high-dimensional. The Gaussian approximations are justified with asymptotic theorems, and the whole method is evaluated on several experiments."

The main idea of randomly sampling canaries that are orthogonal with everything else with high probability is novel to my knowledge. Being able to estimate the privacy loss in a single training run, with minimal effect on the target model's accuracy, makes the method fairly practical."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The analytical privacy bound doesn't seem like a good \"ground truth\" for the comparison with CANIFE, as the analytical bound is expected to be much larger than necessary. The best $\\epsilon$ to return would be the upper bound that any membership inference attack could achieve, which is of course not known. It is possible that your method is simply overestimating the best $\\epsilon$, and is closer to the analytical because of that, and not because it is better at estimating the best $\\epsilon$ than CANIFE. This does not seem a too remote of a possibility, as if your result was accurate, it would imply that CANIFE grossly underestimated the $\\epsilon$, and simply doesn't work in the setting.\n\nA better \"ground truth\" would be an $\\epsilon$ lower bound obtained from the TPR and FPR of some strong membership inference attack. It might be possible to use your method as this attack by thresholding the cosine test statistics $g_i$, and estimating the TPRs and FPRs that different thresholds give empirically.\n\nThe proofs are missing some details, which makes them harder to understand and check than necessary. In the proof of Theorem 3.1, what is the value of the measure $A_d(\\theta)$, and how is it derived from the $(d-2)$ measure of its boundary? In the proof of Theorem 3.2, $t$ is not defined. You should also name the theorem that allows you to conclude convergence in distribution from pointwise convergence of the density function, and you should explicitly account for the fact that the density of $t$ is 0 outside $[-\\sqrt{d}, \\sqrt{d}]$.\n\nThese two issues are the main reason for my score, and I will increase the score if they are addressed.\n\nRegarding the challenge to come up with an attack that breaks your method, I can come up with two scenarios where this is likely to happen. The first is not using a cryptographically secure random number generator to generate the Gaussian noise, which would allow an attacker to remove the noise if they can break the insecure RNG. The second is an attack based on finite-precision issues with floating point numbers (see Mironov 2012 and Holohan and Braghin 2021), if the noise is not sampled with defenses against these in place. I don't think your method would detect these, as it is only looking at the noise as a real number, and detecting either scenario seems to require looking at the noise as a finite-precision float. Of course, your method is not designed to detect anything like these in the first place, and I don't think any of alternatives are either, so this is not a large limitation, but it should still be mentioned.\n\nReferences:\n- N.
