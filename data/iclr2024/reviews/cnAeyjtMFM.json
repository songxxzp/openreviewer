The key intuition behind the authors' method is to estimate the salient anatomy nodes of graph-structured data, while regarding remaining nodes as witnesses to enhance the robustness of node representations. Building on these concepts, this paper introduces the Witness Graph Topological Layer (WGTL), which takes into account both local and global topological graph features to improve model robustness. The authors validate their method against global and local poisoning attacks on citation graphs using the GCN architecture and demonstrate that their topological layer and regularized topological loss can enhance the robustness of GCN."

                "value": "I have major concerns, mostly regarding the experimental evaluation section. I find the current form of the experiments to be lacking in several aspects for the following reasons:\n- There is a lack of comparisons with previous non-topological works. While I agree that this work would be the first to utilize persistent homology, previous baseline methods also consider similar information/knowledge, such as neighboring structure or connectivity patterns using other concepts. Simply demonstrating improvements over the vanilla GCN or combining with a single specific baseline may not be entirely convincing.\n- The entire set of experiments is conducted using GCN. The significant improvement observed in GCN may be attributed to its naive mechanism. Given that the incorporation of a multi-scale receptive field for node representation is already well-explored in the field of graph neural networks, it is highly recommended to conduct experiments on more recent graph neural networks.\n- Can this method also perform well on heterophilous graphs or molecular graphs? The proposed method has only been validated on homophilous graphs, particularly citation networks. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether this strategy can exhibit versatility when applied to other types of graphs."
