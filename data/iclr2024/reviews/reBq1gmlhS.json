In RLHF, humans provide rankings for multiple (state, action) pairs (in LLM applications, (prompt, text) pairs) to train a reward model, which is used for downstream reinforcement learning tasks. This paper tries to study how to train the reward model while ensuring DP on the ranking dataset. To do this, this paper takes the theoretical model of [Zhu et al, 2023], which assumes that humans have real numerical preferences for (state, action) pair in a linear form $r_{\\theta^*}(s, a) = \\langle \\theta^*, \\phi(s, a)\\rangle$ and sample rankings according to some classical probability models based on the numerical preferences (Bradley-Terry-Luce, Plackett-Luce). So, the central task is to learn the parameter $\\theta^*$ differentially privately. The paper shows that this can be done by standard DP techniques. Also, the paper shows that the downstream reinforcement learning performance using a reward model with the DP-learned parameter is similar to that of the non-DP learned parameter."

I know that this is a theoretical paper, but I do think experimental results are necessary here, for the following reasons: The purpose of introducing differential privacy to RLHF is to protect the privacy of the human data providers __in practice__. This paper's theoretical results provide upper bounds on privacy loss and the learning performance loss due to privacy guarantee, _under an idealized model_ ([Zhu et al, 2023]'s model). Humans' ranking behavior may not follow that idealized model, and the RLHF algorithms (for both the reward training and the downstream RL) used in practice are not necessarily the algorithms analyzed in this paper. Whether the theoretical results in this paper can be applied is questionable. Given that the theoretical contribution of this paper is only marginal (see below), I think an empirical contribution (trying DP on real datasets with real RLHF algorithms) is needed here.\n\n(2) My second concern is that the technical contribution of this paper is marginal. The DP technique (adding Gaussian noises to the loss function and the solution in a convex optimization) is a standard technique from [Bassily et al, 2019a] and [Kifer et al, 2012]. The linear reward + BTL/PL model is the same as [Zhu et al, 2023]. The proofs of the theorems are basically a combination of the proofs from these two lines of previous work.\n\nDue to the above two concerns I recommend weak reject."
