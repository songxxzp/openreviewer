Are mean prediction disparity and maximum prediction disparity the only approaches for continuous sensitive attributes for demographic parity? Part of the discussion in the introduction should be put in the related work section. There are also existing literature using distance covariance to measure independence between the sensitive attributes and the predictions [1, 2].

                "value": "The authors address the question of measuring fairness when the sensitive attribute is continuous, e.g. weight or age.\n\nIn particular, the authors point out the weakness of the GDP measure introduced by Jiang et al., which is not sensitive to small groups, i.e. when a slice of population s \\in [a, b] has small probability measure, its contribution to GDP will be negligible. This is a bad quality for a fairness measure, since small populations are often the source of biased classifiers.\n\nThe authors propose to consider a new measure, which better approximates the original DP. Unlike GDP, they sample the segments in a way that makes each of them of significant measure (hyperparameter alpha). They confirm their findings with theoretical analysis, as well as experimentally.\n\nDespite sound motivation and the method proposed, I think there is room for improving this paper. Although the theory presents some insightful results, it does not study analyse the whole problem. Specifically, they show how \\tilde{M} fluctuates around M, and then they show how DP-alpha based on M approximates \\tilde{M}. However, the two results are not connected. For this particular reason, it is not clear what is a good choice of alpha, there is clearly some trade-off happening between Theorem 2 and Theorem 4, but the reader has to figure it out by themselves. Furthermore, they do not address the question of estimating the segments from the sample, h_alpha are assumed to be known from the true distribution. Finally, your solution is relevant to non-parametric regression with nearest neighbours, and this has to be pointed out, with appropriate references.\n\nI also have a concern regarding Theorem 4. The authors propose that as alpha -> 0, the difference goes to zero. But it is not obvious to the reader, perhaps it is better to keep a potentially weaker result in the main part, and move the original one to appendix. I also think this difference (k - h_a(k)) depends on the distribution and the measure around the point k. I.e. if k at the end of a mode of a distribution, this difference will not go to zero. This nuance has to be highlighted."
