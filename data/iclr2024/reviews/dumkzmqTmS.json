Researchers developed new factors using six capital flow similarity graphs to understand stock fund flows. When integrated into an XGBoost model, these graph-based factors outperformed traditional models in several key market performance metrics, highlighting the potential of graph data in improving quantitative trading strategies."

The authors should evaluate the effects (1) The method to incorporate relational information (2) How to obtain relational information. The authors should include baselines to extract relational information from other sources and literature.\n3. The paper considers only one machine learning model (XGBoost) for experimentation. Evaluating with other models like neural networks could demonstrate the wider applicability of the proposed techniques.\n4. The presentation of the paper can be improved. The legends in Figures 4 is too small and blur to be read. It is not clear what the colors represent in tables. There are also several missing space before citations."

The authors empirically verify the incremental value of these newly proposed graphs by employing a multifactor XGBoost model, which incorporates a representation of the fund correlation graph into the baseline multifactor model."
