The idea is to assume SSMs that are non-linear and avoid assumptions like Gaussianity when using variational inference. The driving idea is thus to preserve the temporal structure in the variational proposal. This seems to lead to what is called \"exponential family dynamical systems\", that is, a double-looped (forward and backward) chain of Markovian conditionals."

Particularly, technical details jump in to solve issues of previous technical details (derivations begin at the beginning of pp. 2 and finish at the end of pp. 7). In that way, the paper loses quite a lot of space, and story on the general smoothing idea that authors want to solve (and in which way they want to solve it). This is orthogonal to the fact that the technical details and decisions are elegant and well-constructed\n\n[w2] \u2014 the second concern to me is the limited results. Having derived long technical details, with the approximated ELBO, the Lagrangian-based optimization and the additional algorithm, the manuscript should at least provide results proportional to the technical development. In my opinion, the evaluation of the model is somehow short (learning of two synthetic systems (pendulum and chaotic scenario) plus analysis on convergence). In this sense, I would have liked to see experiments proving the feasibility of the model with long time data or similar. (Mainly bc it is indicated that the proposed ELBO delivers a computational cost equivalent to mean-field approximations without such crude factorizations)."

In particular, I sell the decisions taken and I liked a lot the sort of factorization introduced to build the new exponential-family-based ELBO with such structure. However, re-introducing an approximation of this predictive quantity in the ELBO to obtain another approximation of the target objective makes me wonder if the ELBO is 1) still tight wrt. the marginal likelihood, 2) if it is still a lower bound, and 3) if it has drawbacks or additional problems. In that direction, details are not clear to me and I would love to hear back if there is some time still available."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Firstly, I believe the core work is at the requisite level for publication.  The work is sound, and to the best of my knowledge, is novel.  However, I do have numerous questions for the authors as there are aspects of the work I do not understand.  These are listed below.\n\nMy main criticisms of the work breaks down into two parts: the empirical evaluation, and the overall clarity.  \n\n**W.1.:  Experimental evaluation**:  I think the experimental evaluation of the proposed methods is weak.  The problem with simultaneously proposing several methods is that you evaluate each method individually less.  Furthermore, the description of the experiments is comfortably the worst prose in the submission.  For instance, I have pretty much no idea what is being studied in \u201cdBFS: convergence\u201d.  I have outlined my comments on this below.  Evaluation of a single variant on a Van De Pol oscillator, and evaluation of some methods on a chaotic RNN and on a simple pendulum are not exactly compelling applications of a method.  Is the autoencoding method better than the Lagrange method?  Does one have more parameters, hyperparameters, more expensive etc.  There is no actual evaluation of the relative merits of the methods presented.  \n\nThere are also no compelling baselines or applications.  For instance, the original SVAE was applied to analyze mouse data.  I would also like to see comparison to other VAE variants and inference techniques \u2013 VRNNs and DKFs immediately spring to mind.  I think there are also entire families of inference techniques that you could discuss, e.g. VIFLE and SIXO [Kim et al, 2020; Lawson et al 2022], that are untouched.  These are just examples, and need not be quantitative comparisons, but since you are proposing leveraging backwards information or factorizations, this is exactly what VIFLE and SIXO do.  In general, the linking into prior art is incredibly weak.  \n\n**W.2.:  Clarity**:  My main concern is not so much in the actual writing of the paper, but the clarity of the message.  I think the authors have tried to pile so many ideas and derivations into a single paper that the core message is actually obfuscated.  \n\nI\u2019ll try and give an example.  If the Lagrange method is universally better than the autoencoding method (or vice versa) then omit the weaker method from the main text.  If there are conditions where one is better/preferable than the other, then there should be an explicit experiment tackling this, so that the reader can understand the difference.  \n\nBeyond this, I am not sure _why_ I should be interested in this method.  I have made some of these questions explicit in the Questions section.  It is stated early on that forwards and backwards factorizations have different analysis properties \u2013 this is then not mentioned throughout the paper.  It is also stated that a certain factorization underuses dynamics and is inefficient \u2013 this is not shown anywhere in the paper, but seems like a fairly fundamental justification for the method.  There are no experimental results that help justify the complexity or show that this method instantly overcomes some hurdles faced by previous methods.  \n\nThere are no diagrams outlining the various steps or architectures;  tables compactly contrasting the methods or their free variables;  or summary paragraphs summarizing what was introduced.  All these are tools to make the paper easier to understand.  And easier to understand papers ultimately have a greater reach and impact!  \n\nThere are also no fail cases or real limitations of the method stated \u2013 which for a method that doesn\u2019t actually optimize a true ELBO and has a number of approximations is definitely required.  \n\nI think this paper would _greatly_ benefit from thinning out the content.  I appreciate the authors not trying to slice the contributions too thinly, but (again as an example) I query if the vBF connection really fits with this paper.  I would almost rather that be removed, to make more room for a more thorough and focused discussion and comparison of the dBFS and aBFS algorithms.  There would also be more space for a more thorough (quantitative or qualitative) comparison to existing works, and where this work improves over those methods.  \n\n\n## Minor comments:\n- a. Throughout the paper, there are parameters ($\\nu, \\lambda, \\ldots$) in equations or objectives that do not show up in the right hand side (e.g. $\\lambda$ and $\\theta$ in (17-18)).  It would be much better if the authors consistently and explicitly indicated which terms are indexed by which parameters.  \n- b. Tables and figures should be floated to the top or bottom of the page, as opposed to inlined in text (c.f. Figure 3).  \n- c. I don\u2019t feel like Figure 1 actually helps that much.  I would rather it be written out as a proper pseudocode algorithm block that I can follow, as opposed to restating snippets of math that appear elsewhere.  (It\u2019s also a huge figure that could be made _much_ smaller.  Side by side algorithms?)\n- d. It would be nice if somewhere there was a table outlining the constraints on the model family that can be analyzed.  \n- e. I have completely lost the thread of how the methods interact with each other by the time we get to \u201cvBF: smoothing chaotic dynamics\u201d, and i\u2019m not really sure how to read the results from the table.  \n\n\n## Comments on \u201cdBFS convergence\u201d:\n- vBFS isn\u2019t defined in the text.\n- Why is Figure 2b studying an L-VAE?  What has that got to do with dBFS?\n- (20) and (21) are a condition for optimality, and so how can you say the method converges _faster_?\n- There is no other line to compare to on the LHS panel in each figure.\n- Why are the particle filters bound so low?  PFs are asymptotically tight.  You should run it with a range of particles to see how many particles are required to get a tight bound.  \n- The middle panel is practically unexplained \u2013 is it good that the $\\lambda$s are approaching zero?  \n- Colors and line styles are clashing.  Is the histogram over dBFS, L-VAE or mean field, or is it over 1, 10 and 100 steps.  Pick some different colors, or, give each subfigure its own legend.  \n- Is \u201cno. dual steps\u201d the same as the colored 1, 10, and 100?\n- I don\u2019t even really know what the objective of this experiment is.  I think it is showing/sanity-checking that variational inference works?  That is sort of to be expected.  But with nothing to compare it to, it isn\u2019t telling me a great deal.\n\n\n**Summary** I think this paper shows great promise.  The core of the work is clearly publication-standard, and the authors have tried hard to make it digestible.  Unfortunately right now I believe their efforts are slightly misguided, and have resulted in a paper that doesn\u2019t quite hit the home run that it is so close to.  I would be happy to accept a paper where the vBF content is removed, and replaced with a more thorough discussion and evaluation of the core methods.  I have tried to be thorough in my questions below, and if answered, I am happy to upgrade my score."

            "questions": {
                "value": "**Q.1.**:  Why does L have different parameters in (10) vs (11)? ($\\lambda$ vs $q$)\n\n**Q.2.**:    Just below (14), you point out that as a result of the approximations it is no longer a valid ELBO.  This seems bad (although not terminal), and I was surprised this issue is not referenced or addressed elsewhere.  If this is being optimized end-to-end, and the objective is not a true bound, then you cannot make guarantees on what you are optimizing.  Can the authors comment on this.\n\n**Q.3.**:   At the bottom of page 4, you say the following:\n\n```The backward factorization will make gaining insight into the structure of the variational posterior analytically easier; whereas $L_F(q)$ is easier to use in an amortized inference setting where trajectories from the approximate posterior are drawn and used to form a stochastic approximation of the bound (Krishnan et al., 2016; Karl et al., 2016)```. \n\nAgain, this is not obvious to me.  Nowhere else in the paper is the interpretability of the ELBO considered.  You also assert that $L_F$ is easier to evaluate compared to $L_B$, but then later on, you evaluate $L_B$, so I don't understand what the difference is. \n\n**Q.4.**:  This method be applied to any model with exponential family potentials?  Can one mix and match potential types?  I\u2019m thinking something like a Poisson-HMM would be a nice demonstrative example of this, and one where there are many readily available baselines you could compare to.  \n\n**Q.5.**:  (Following on from Q.4.)  Are the D-VAE, L-VAE and N-VAE all different model classes, or proposal classes?  It would be interesting to compare the inference performance of some different models on some different applications.  For instance, with sufficiently small discretization steps, an extended Kalman filter would solve the Van Der Pol oscillator problem.  How does the inference performance of both methods break down as that timestep grows larger?  Have you tested how close to an exponential family the empirical distributions are, and whether your inference objective learns models that have \u201cbetter\u201d approximate posteriors? \n\n**Q.6.**:  Can the authors clarify why natural gradient steps are preferable?  What would happen if you didn\u2019t use NG, and which other methods can use NG?\n\n**Q.7.**: How computationally expensive is each method?  You say that the Lagrange step is parallelizable, but the autoencoding variant almost certainly isn\u2019t for sequence data (unless you use something like S4 as the RNN).  \n\n**Q.8.**: I think I understand the constrained optimization step, but if the authors could clarify:  Instead of optimizing all the parameters freely, you switch to an EM-like alternating optimization, where the M-step looks like a constrained optimization.  This allows you to decouple the timesteps by essentially treating some of the summary statistics as fixed.  Does this coordinate-wise method have any drawbacks?    \n\n**Q.9.**: This is a relatively core question, but can the authors concretely re-state _why_ we should consider a backward factorization of the proposal?  Specifically which step cannot be achieved if we use a forward factorization?  And where does each method break down?"

                "value": "This paper develops a number of algorithms for smoothing of exponential family dynamical systems. The main contributions are summarized as follows.\n\nFirst, the paper introduces a prior-parameterized backward factorization to the smoothing posterior. This factorization $ q(z_t|z_{t-1}) $ includes a model of the dynamics $ p_\\theta(z_{t+1}|z_t)$  so that it factors similarly to the true posterior, and additionally allows for linear scaling with the number of timesteps without the assumption of independence (as in mean field approximation). When using this backward factorization, one obtains a convenient and simplified expression for the ELBO, which includes terms that are KLs of expectations through conditionals, as opposed to KLs of expectations. One thing that was unclear to me was the claim that \"The backward factorization will make gaining insight into the structure of the variational posterior analytically easier\". Could this be elaborated on? Additionally, to facilitate tractability, all terms in this factorization were replaced by their closest exponential family approximations.\n\nSecond, the authors develop a smoothing algorithm (dBFS) that allows for parameters to be learned in parallel with the addition of lagrange multipliers which constrains $\\mu_t^- = E_{q_{t-1}}[\\mu_\\theta(z_{t-1})]$, i.e. consistency of the parameters between timesteps. \n\nThird, by noting the relationships between the natural parameters and the Lagrange multipliers (Eq. 20), the authors introduce an amortized smoothing algorithm (aBFS) that introduces function approximators to learn the functions present in these relationships, leading to a VAE-style algorithm for smoothing. The authors also show how this algorithm can be applied for sequential inference for more practical applications in Sec 3.3 via vBF."
