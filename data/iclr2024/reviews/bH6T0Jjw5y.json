The solution is based on information theory where the aim is to learn latent representations that capture the dynamical properties of the original process at at a selected time-lag by capturing relevant temporal features and discarding irrelevant high frequency information. The final objective is a trade-off between sufficiency (how informative is the learned representation of the dynamic properties of interest) and minimality of irrelevant information."

Given that the encoder is time-independent, how can we expect the autoinformation between $x_t$ to be related in any way to the autoinformation in $z_t$?\n\n3: The paper sets up the reader to expect a solution that is faster than current available methods for simulation. I was expecting experiments measuring how long it takes for the simulations to be run compared to existing methods. Can the authors provide that?\n\nIf above questions are addressed I'll be happy to re-visit my score.\n\n[UPDATE: authors addressed above points sufficiently. Score has been updated.]"

Through experiments, the paper demonstrates the efficacy of T-IB in creating information-optimal representations for modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Comparison with Past-Future IB Method: The paper builds upon the past-future IB method proposed by Tiwary et al., but it introduces an optimization objective for I(z_t, z_t+tau) instead of I(z_t, x_t+tau). While theoretically, optimizing I(z_t, z_t+tau) is expected to yield a lower bound on I(z_t, x_t+tau), the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the differences between the two approaches. A deeper exploration of the distinctions and the implications of this choice is needed to provide a clearer understanding.\n\n2. Choice of Estimation Method: In the machine learning domain, there are various methods for estimating lower bounds on mutual information. The paper selects a specific method, but it would benefit from a more thorough justification for this choice. Providing a comparative analysis of the selected method against other available options would enhance the paper's robustness.\n\n3. Complexity of Additional Terms in Formula (8): The introduction of two additional terms in Formula (8) may appear somewhat perplexing. From an information bottleneck theory perspective, the goal is to discard as much irrelevant information as possible. However, dimensionality reduction inherently leads to information loss. The rationale and impact of introducing these terms need further clarification. Moreover, the experimental results suggest that the inclusion of these terms does not significantly affect the dimensionality reduction outcome, requiring a more detailed explanation.\n\n4. Quantitative Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction: The paper lacks a robust quantitative evaluation of the dimensionality reduction results. While the field may lack a general method for quantitatively assessing dimensionality reduction outcomes, the authors could consider exploring quantitative evaluation approaches, such as measuring mutual information under different tau conditions, to provide a more concrete assessment of the method's performance.\n\n5. Comparison with VAMPnet: VAMPnet, as mentioned in the weaknesses, primarily serves the purpose of extracting dominant or slow components and estimating kinematic properties. It may not be a direct dimensionality reduction method. Comparing VAMPnet with the proposed approach for dimensionality reduction may not be entirely fair or informative."

This paper proposes modeling state in latent space and computing large steps in time directly. The transition and emission distributions are approximated using variational inference. The optimization scheme is two step: first the encoding distribution $q(z | x)$ is learned and then the rest is learned. The approach ensures that the latent space contains information about the original state through the mutual information and \"autoinformation\". They introduce a loss T-InfoMax that maximizes mutual information on latent state across some resolution gap. Finally, they introduce an information bottleneck to discard unnecessary information such as time dependent information, resulting in a loss T-IB. All the mutual information terms are approximated, some are learned with neural contrastive estimation."
