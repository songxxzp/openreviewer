Regarding its content, I have the following concerns.\n\nI don't generally understand what \"query-efficient\" means in this paper, especially in the theoretical part (section 3.1). If I understand it correctly, the authors proposed an algorithm and showed that it achieves good suboptimality upper bound. Then how is small optimality related to \"query efficiency\"? I would expect \"query efficiency\" to have something to do with active learning. Otherwise it is simply \"statistical efficiency\".\n\nAnother concern is that there seems to be a big gap between the theoretical algorithm and the practical one (i.e. algorithm 1 vs algorithm 2). All theoretical results are developed for alg 2 while the experiments are conducted for alg 1. I think this is acceptable only when the gap between the two algorithms is small. However, I feel that the gap is large in my current understanding. For instance, alg 2 assumes a query oracle but alg 2 doesn't. Alg 1 uses an optimistic bonus, but no correspondence is found for alg 1. In addition, Alg 1 is heuristic and lacks some explanation. For example, why the loss functions in (14) and (15) are introduced is not explained (eg, why using expectile loss). The intuitive explanation of adding clipped Gaussian noise is not provided, which may be confusing."

I am not sure how complicated the experiment is, but 10 sounds really small. Could the authors explain more about it?"

As a result the paper is easier to read, thus addressing _W1_. The manuscript remains rather mathematical, but that is the nature of the research.\n\nAs for _W2_, the authors conducted additional experiments with mujoco-gym, but OPRIDE surpassing or equalling Preference Transformer (albeit by a lower margin than in Metaworld)."

Do you mean $K$ the number of queries?\n* _Q3_: In figure 4, for `push-v2`, both baselines beat OPRIDE at K>15. Why is that?

In this setting, the dataset of trajectories is fixed and the agent must choose pairs of to submit for a preference. \n\nFirst, they assume a linear transition and reward model. Building on top of the PEVI method, they construct a confidence set of reward functions using a projected MLE estimator. Given that confidence set, they construct a set of near-optimal policies. In order to explore maximally, they choose the pair of policies for which there are two reward functions in the confidence set under which these policies achieve maximally different values. They show that the suboptimality of the method is bounded by the sum of two terms: one that is O(1/sqrt(N)) in the dataset size and one that is O(1/sqrt(K)) in the number of comparisons.\n\nNext, they give an implementable algorithm that works with a static offline dataset. It seems that they augment each trajectory L times with L sampled clipped Gaussians. They train N reward functions by a preference transformer method and compute an optimistic reward function using ensemble disagreement. At each round, the agent chooses the trajectories for which the weighted sum of reward predictions has the largest difference between 2 of the ensemble members. Finally, using IQL, they train optimistic V and Q functions and extract a policy. \n\nThey evaluate the implementation on a set of Meta-World manipulation tasks as well as Antmaze. In each they make 10 pairwise queries prior to evaluation the policy performance. They compare against  a handful of recent methods for offline preference-based reward learning. In the experiments, it is clear that this method performs best on the set of manipulation + Antmaze benchmarks. Afterwards, the authors proform studies of the number of queries required to achieve good performance and an ablation where they remove the optimism and the selection method and see how that affects performance."

You can incorporate Markdown and Latex into your review. See https://openreview.net/faq.\n\nThe problem setting is reasonable and seems like a good way of supervising given large offline dynamics datasets and a hard-to-compute reward function.
