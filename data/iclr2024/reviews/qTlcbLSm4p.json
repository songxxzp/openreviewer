                "value": "+ The paper mentioned that \"most current models follow the linear (Ho et al., 2020) or cosine (Nichol & Dhariwal, 2021) schedule\" and \"an ideal noise schedule should be resolution-dependent (See Figure 2)\" but looking into Figure 2, I cannot see which noise schedule is used there, either cosine or linear, making it very confusing to capture what the authors want to say. Again, the next sentence said \"train high-resolution models directly with common schedules designed for resolutions of 32\u00d732 or 64\u00d764 pixels\" but Figure 2 only shows the 64px and 256px (what about 32x32) --> What is the relationship between 32x32 or 64x64 pixels and the one shown in Figure 2 (64px/256px)?\n\n+ The advantage of the proposed method is emphasized with training efficiency, however, it only considers the setting without CFG where some competitors do not yield the optimal output. I believe that it is better also more meaningful to compare all methods in the setting with CFG where the existing methods achieve the best performance (optimal setting). Furthermore, when claiming the efficiency, I would also expect the comparison of the inference time/steps of the proposed method with the existing ones in their best optimal regime (including sampling steps in Table 3.).\n\n+ While the proposed method achieves slightly better sFID compared to MDT-XL/2-G on class-conditional generation ImageNet 256x256 (Table 3) (3.97 vs. 4.57, not really \"a large margin\" as stated in the abstract), however, most other metrics lag behind MDT-XL/2-G (such as FID, IS, and Recall). This indicates that to show its advantages over the existing approaches, it may need to present more evidence.\n\n+ Section 4.2 talking about CeleA-HQ, mentioned fewer training iterations while it is given with 50M and 820M trained images, making it a bit confusing that the dataset contained a hundred million images or that is just the total training steps. I recommend revising it more clearly and putting a column on the side of that table about the total training iterations or total training images."

To my knowledge, ImageNet contains more than one million images, am I wrong? The same for all other datasets., does CelebA-HQ have 70 million images for training? Also, in Figure 1, is the horizontal axis the real number of images for training or it is just the iterations?"

First, it develops a novel diffusion/denoising process formulation, where the noise, added to an image, is locally correlated for the higher resolution images. Then, instead of concatenating the upsampled low-resolution images channel-wise, the diffusion process is unified for low and higher resolution images. As such, it does not need to train the low-resolution generator from scratch and uses the pre-trained EDM checkpoints. The framework achieves SOTA FID results on ImageNet $256^2$ and CelebA-HQ $256^2$. The paper also contains interesting analysis of the frequencies of noised/clean images in low/medium resolutions and also some curious insights about the cascaded diffusion models."

Also, it's not fair to claim the reduced amount of training steps for a non-from-scratch trained model.\n- Can it be the case that the reduced amount of sampling steps is due to the 2-nd order sampler? For example, MDT uses DDPM sampler, which was shown by EDM to require more sampling steps.\n- For a fair comparison, please report the training/inference costs of the developed model vs the baselines (where possible).\n- Please, update the claims about the convergence speed (especially the teaser paper) to specify that the model is not trained from scratch.\n- Please, update the claims about SotA FID based on the unbalanced FID instead of the class-balanced FID.\n- Why not try dynamic CFG as well to further improve FIDs?
