Existing methods either use node clustering or node selection to reduce the size of the graph. In this paper, the authors propose GLA-Pool to incorporate both global and local information of the graph. Specifically, clique algorithm is utilized to extract all the possible maximal cliques, then each clique is transformed into a single node to form a pooled graph, which captures the global property. To capture its local property, an attention mechanism is performed in each clique to select important nodes. Experimental results on several public datasets and methods demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve satisfied performance."

The main challenge in this paper appears to be the design of the local and global structure learning components.

The same issue arises with methods for learning local information. Moreover, method [1] also focuses on capturing global structures, and [2] provides a detailed discussion on pooling operations. A comparison between existing methods and the two components designed in this study should be provided to justify their effectiveness.\n\n2. The evaluation of data augmentations is overlooked. Although data augmentations are provided in this paper, their evaluations are ignored. It appears that GLA employs a data augmentation trick while the baselines do not, which creates an unfair advantage in the experiments.\n\n3. The classification of LTS and GTS.

In particular, the dual-strategy-based pooling resembles SAGPool in the way it generates attention with reference to clique information. The authors should provide a better positioning of their work in the existing literature.\n\n2. The notation used in this paper lacks consistency and is confusing. Conventionally, bold capital letters are used to represent matrices, bold lowercase letters signify vectors, and lowercase letters denote scalars. However, the notation system in the paper mixes up these conventions: e.g., using \"X,\" \"M,\" and \"C_r\" to represent a matrix, vector, and scalar, respectively, making the equations hard to understand. Additionally, if \"C\" represents a set of total cliques, it should be denoted as \"|C|\" in Equation (2).\n\n3. The paper lacks adequate discussions and comparisons with substructure-counting based methods, such as references [1], [2], and [3].\n\n4. The experiments are conducted on small-scale datasets.

The ablation study is limited. Some aspects of the model design, such as node augmentation and the inclusion of GCN and GAT in the dual-channel, require further discussions and analyses.\n\n6. The visualizations provided in the paper do not effectively support the motivation of using cliques in graph pooling. Given the limited presence of cliques with three or more nodes, it may be more informative to highlight the significance of capturing cycles in graph structures.\n\n7.
