                "value": "* The construction of the universal approximator only has a theoretical meaning. While this is the case for many UAT results, the particular construction in this paper is based on extending a continuous function on a Cantor set to the interval $[0,1]$. This can never be done stably in practice, which impairs the significance of the paper to the ICLR community.\n* The work is very incremental. It is a straightforward assembly of Yarotsky's result and Shen's result. It is not made clear in the paper what is the originality of this particular work. While the paper contains in-text proofs, some of the proofs are not self-contained and are hard to interpret without referring to Shen's result.\n* The sharpness part of the paper (`section 3`) is questionable. In particular, if I understood correctly, then it is shown that for a single-layer NN, we need at least a width of $d$ to do universal approximation. However, as far as I understood, the UAT result (`Theorem 3`) is for multi-layer NNs. Hence, sharpness is actually not shown. In particular, in a single-layer case, the statement made in `section 3` is almost obvious, because the possible level sets of such a NN form a subspace of dimension $< d$, which cannot be used to do universal approximation.\n* The activation functions used in the UAT are not standard in the deep learning society.\n* The paper has not been carefully proofread by the author(s). The statements of the theorems are not always clear, and there are a lot of typos. To name a few:\n    * The definition of $f$ in section 1.4 does not make sense without variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_d$ on the right-hand side.\n    * In the second paragraph of  `section 2`, the uniform norm is not properly denoted and the family $\\mathcal{A}$ is not in math mode.\n    * In the third paragraph of `section 3`, `most of all standard activation functions` is not a standard expression.\n    * In the statement of `Theorem 2`, it is unclear what $N_1$ and $N_2$ are without referring to the paragraph before. Then, in the proof, it is said that `It will be enough for us to prove that for any $\\epsilon > 0$ there exist functions $N_1, N_2$`. The functions $N_1$ and $N_2$ are prescribed and used in the statement of `Theorem 2`. Why should you find those functions in your proof?\n    * In `Theorem 3`, it is unclear what is the quantifier on `with a combination of super expressive activation functions and EUAF`. Do you prefix a set of possible activation functions or it depends on the function you will approximate? Can they be used arbitrarily in the NN you construct, or do you have to use a certain activation function for a specific neuron?\n    * In `Theorem 4`, it is never mentioned what the activation functions are.\n    * `Therefore` is misspelled on page 5. The condition $d = 2$ is not in math mode in the proof of `Theorem 4`. In the same paragraph, `$g$ a continuous` needs to be corrected. The word ''cannot'' should not be spelled as ''can not.''"

                "value": "* What is the depth of your NN in each of your theorems?\n* What is the particular NN architecture that you have in mind? I assume it is fully-connected feed-forward, but you should have a mathematical formula for your NN in a theoretical paper. In addition, do you have bias terms in the NN and does the last layer have an activation function?\n* In the second paragraph of `section 2`, you wrote `each hidden neuron equipped with some fixed activation from the family \\mathcal{A}`. Do you mean the activation function is fixed throughout the NN? What about the activation functions in your UAT theorem?\n* Not a question but a remark. It is not safe to claim that the UAT result in the paper ''alley the curse of dimensionality,'' because the curse of dimensionality is more about the difficulty in sampling the function than approximating it in theory."
