This architecture draws inspiration from a conventional fully connected neural network, with each neuron in a nonlinear operator layer being determined by a bounded linear operator connecting input and output neurons, in addition to a function-based bias term. To address the efficient parameterization of these bounded linear operators within the architecture, the authors introduce MgNO (Multigrid Neural Operator). MgNO utilizes multigrid structures to effectively model and approximate these linear operators, eliminating the need for conventional lifting and projecting operators while accommodating diverse boundary conditions. Numerical experiments highlight the advantages of MgNO over CNN-based models and spectral-type neural operators, demonstrating improved ease of training and reduced susceptibility to overfitting."
