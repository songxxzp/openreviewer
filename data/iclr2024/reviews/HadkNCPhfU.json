While the former sections of the paper are exceptionally well-written, the later parts, particularly the approach section, pose challenges in terms of comprehension\uff1b\n2.  It is challenging to grasp the underlying meaning of 'latent labels' in the explored hierarchical structure. For instance, 'red' and 'green' appear to be related to both 'apple' and 'paint,' even though the author provided Example 1\uff1b\n3.  Following the previous question, it is important to note that in the current method, which is based on a hierarchical, the calibration of predictions at each level becomes crucial. However, the authors currently seem to neglect the calibration at latent levels;\n4.  The theoretical analysis presented lacks valuable insights for the proposed approach. Furthermore, the author fails to clearly and concisely describe the integration of theory with their proposed approach, as mentioned in the Weaknesses 1;\n5.  The datasets used in the paper are very small and trivial, and the comparative methods employed are not up to date with the SOTA. The experiments are not convincing enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

This confuses me how the conditional probabilities of latent nodes benefit the learning of leaf nodes. In my view, Example 1 only show how to get the marginal probabilities of latent nodes from some given conditional distribution of leaf nodes through Bayes rule.\n\n+ In Eq. (2), the dimension of A is $N$, so the dimension of the latent labels is $N-K$. Does this mean that we need to specify the number of categories of hidden labels in advance? How to set this hyper-parameter for different datasets, and do different values of this parameter affect the performance for one single dataset? Besides, how do we know the number of levels of label hierarchies? In other words, could the proposed method learn a multi-level class hierarchy? This is unclear in the manuscript.\n\n+ In Theorem 2, is $\\mathbf 1_N$ a N-dim vector whose elements are all 1? The authors should provide detailed notation for readers.\n\n+ It\u2019s hard to understand Definition 1 since there are so many unclear descriptions. For example, what\u2019s the meaning of $\\mu_s$ and $\\mu_r$. As mentioned above, $\\alpha_{sr}$ is a matrix, but in Eq. (3) it seems a scalar. Those unclear words make make it hard to follow this Section.\n\n+ Is $w_s$ in Eq. (4) a hyper-parameter or a learnable parameters?\n\n+ In Section 3.3, does the Task (a) says that one can pre-define $\\mathbf A_1$ rather than learn it by the proposed method? If so, how to perform it? The sentence \u201cwe choose A1 to be a trivial binary tree or trees derived from prior knowledge such as a part of a knowledge graph or a decision tree.\u201d is quite unclear.\n\n+ The authors should compare the proposed method with other methods for learning label hierarchy in order to demonstrate its superiority."

A vast number of approaches have been proposed for SSL based on augmentation,  regularization etc. This paper follows the key intuition of enforcing label-label correlations through learned label hierarchies as a an effective regularization strategy to improve SSL performance. \n\nWhile label hierarchies have been leveraged for SSL earlier, the key novelty of this paper appears to be that it learns a part of the hierarchy by exploiting unlabeled data, thus leading to task-aligned hierarchies. Specifically, the proposed approach learns soft edge weights between a set of latent variables (instantiated to concepts from pre-existing domain-informed hierarchies) and a set of observed variables (actual labels in an SSL). A mathematical framework around Wasserstein distance is proposed for this, although it appears to serve only as an interesting connection and not essential to the central premise of this paper. \n\nExperimental results show significant gains when labeled data is very sparse, mainly when the proposed SEAL regularizer is combined with other previously proposed, effective SSL techniques such as DebiasPL and FlexMatch."
