                "value": "1. My major concern w.r.t. this paper is that, while I agree on the importance of the proposed problem that we should particularly focus on certain classes instead of all classes, I feel that this can be achieved in many ways. For example, during training, one can particularly control the loss weight for certain particular classes. Moreover, during quantization, one can perform input-aware bit assignment [1] to set higher bit for images in which critical classes are hardly distinguishable and lower bit for other images. Thus, while I admit that the Fisher information can be a feasiable perspective, I hope that the authors can discuss more on its advantages over other seems feasible ways.\n\n[1] Instance-Aware Dynamic Neural Network Quantization\n\n2. I am worried on the generalizability of the proposed method. On the one hand, in real-life scenarios, there are often cases that the user only know that there is an object detector but does not know that whether the object detector is based on DETR or based on other object detectors. Thus, if this method can only be used on DETR, this can limit its generalizability and usage. On the other hand, the observation and demonstration in this paper seem to be focus on COCO, which can also be limited especially when this paper emphasize on its solving of real-world problem. I guess a real-world problem can only be regarded as well-solved if it can be solved in a rather general manner.\n\n3. The last concern I have is w.r.t. the experiment. Specifially, from my perspective, there can exist a mismatch between the experiment and the claim of this paper. In other words, the improvement of Fisher-Critical over Fisher-Overall or even Uniform is often limited. This made me have the feeling that, this paper fails to convince me that it proposes a good method for solving the \"the fine-grained critical-category performance\" problem."
