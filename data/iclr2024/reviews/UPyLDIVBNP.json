No such comparisons have been shown on ImageNet. I think it's important to see if the proposed init is even useful when training on large-scale datasets.\n\n---\n\n### W3 - Theoretical analysis limitations\nWhile the paper provides a theoretical analysis of IDInit, it mainly focuses on the Jacobian and gradient update equations in residual neural networks. It would be valuable to extend the theoretical analysis to other network architectures and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles of IDInit.\n\n---\n\n### W4 - Limited discussion on limitations \nAlthough the paper briefly mentions the limitations of IDInit, such as the deterministic nature and the need for momentum to handle negative eigenvalues, further discussion and analysis of these limitations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the potential drawbacks and challenges of implementing IDInit in practical scenarios."

However, in the proof in the appendix, the author only shows the full matrix has rank more than D_0, which is not the same as the residual. Please provide more details in the proof to justify your claim.\n2. The authors claim that the rank constraint can be broken by IDI even when non-linearity like ReLU is not applied. It seems contradict approximation theory which emphasizes the importance of non-linearity to ensure expressivity. It would be great for authors to provide more insights on this point.\n3. Authors mention that dead neurons problem happens when batch normalization set to 0 or downsampling operation cause 0 filled features. However, these cases are not common in practice and it's better to motivate more on why IDIZ is important.\n4.
