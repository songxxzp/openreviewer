The resulting architecture performs competitively in practice, outperforming various existing GNNs on a variety of tasks."

In light of this intuition, the paper might benefit from some discussion of which CFGs are preferable, given that they have the same expressive power.\n\n(2) From my understanding, it seems that this architecture outperforms other architectures in some datasets but not others (table 6), but has the advantage of being the strongest GNN out of those with provable expressivity (since it dominates PPGN). Is this understanding correct? If so, what is the utility of having provable expressivity, beyond the model's performance on the datasets?"

Therefore, how can $G^2N^2$ match the expressiveness of the ordinary 3-WL GNN with a fixed number of layers?\n* I would also like to see how the new GNN model performs on the ZINC-12k and ZINC-full datasets, which are widely used benchmarks for molecular property prediction."
