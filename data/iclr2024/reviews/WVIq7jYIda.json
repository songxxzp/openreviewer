                "value": "The paper introduces the Manifold Kernel Rank Reduced Regression (MKRRR) model as an extension of the Kernel Rank Reduced Regression (KRRR) technique. KRRR enhances regression capabilities for highly dependent datasets with latent variable structures. However, prior research focused on Euclidean space with vector data representation, neglecting the inherent geometric shape of data distribution. The MKRRR model addresses this issue and relies on the intrinsic data distribution, treating the dataset as a manifold.\n\nThe authors define the MKRRR model and derive a closed-form solution for regression and prediction. Finally, the authors present an application of the MKRRR model in 3D mandibular reconstruction for skull repair, demonstrating its effectiveness even on noisy data."

This solution is already available in \"Reduced Rank Ridge Regression and Its Kernel Extensions\" A. Mukherjee et al. from 2011. The proof is very similar, and there is no novelty in the paper.\n\nFurthermore, the MKRRR extension is simply using a Gaussian kernel and replacing the Euclidean distance by a Riemannian one. This should be stated in a clearer manner and more straightforwardly.\n\nThe application is not very convincing. The figures 3 and 4 are very noisy. The figure 4 is not readable and the figure 5 is barely presented. Hence, it is hard to draw conclusions from the experimental section. Furthermore, the hyper parameters seem to have been tuned on the test set."

The three proposed in table 1 are either not geodesic distances or not positive definite.\n\nIn the numerical experiments:\n\n1) What do you mean by \"each point corresponds to one by one\"?\n2) From figure 4, the rank value seems to have no effect on the performance. Can you comment on that?\n3) Can you explain the comparison in figure 5? How do you compare PCA, PGA to MKRRR? The first two are only preprocessing steps while MKRRR does a regression.\n4) What is the noise in figure 5? Do you add a Gaussian noise to data?"
