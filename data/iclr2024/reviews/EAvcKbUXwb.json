                "value": "This paper identifies the problem of directly using equivariant latent representations for subsequent visualization tasks without considering the associated inductive bias of equivariance. The authors suggest employing an invariant projection of the latent representations in Euclidean space, enabling the application of conventional visualization tools to this transformed latent space.\n\nTo validate their approach, the authors present two illustrative examples. In the first scenario, they explore permutation equivariant autoencoders applied to graph data. Through this investigation, they find an isometric cross-section, ensuring the preservation of orbit distances in the space of the latent representation.\n\nIn the second scenario, the focus shifts to rotation-equivariant representations for the task of image classification. In this example, finding an isometric cross-section proves challenging. To address this, the authors propose to use random projections, showcasing their effectiveness through practical demonstrations."

The writing strikes a balance between intuition and rigorousness. The presentation is well-paced and the figures for results are clear.\n- The selected examples effectively substantiate the authors' assertions and are very interesting."

To fix this they propose projecting the equivariant representations with an invariant projection which then ensures that the projected representation preserves invariances. There are however challenges in designing such an invariant projection since it must also retain information. This paper proposes such transformations and shows that they can lead to more reliable interpretation of representations. The efficacy of the proposed method is shown on a molecule graph generation VAE and an MNIST classifier."

For example, I'm not fully sure I understand why one would use equivariant representations when the inputs do not follow the G-equivariance of the representations. For eg, if x and g.x are similar inputs, then an equivariant representation is perhaps not the correct one to analyze such data in the first place. Why wouldn't one, instead just choose some mapping f that is invariant?\n\n2. I did not fully understand Section 4, it read more like a related work section and felt out of place.\n\n3. It was never clear to me what \"analysis of representation\" meant throughout the paper. All the results indicate that \"analysis\" means visualization of the representations in a 2D space. Is that the only \"analysis\" where equivariant representations would show deceiving results? It would help with readability to clarify what kinds of analyses are hard with equivariant representations.\n\n4. Isn't the interpolation experiment self-satisfying? You already claim that after the invariant transform the representation space is convex and thus interpolation makes total sense (and thus the nicer results in Fig 4), whereas this is not the case for equivariant representations (thus results are all over for these in Fig 4). I'm not quite sure what was the purpose of this experiment. Was it to empirically validate the theory?\n\n5. Overall, the paper was a tough read for me. It would be very helpful to start by contextualizing a use case where equivariant representations might need a downstream analysis where equivariance can be misleading, this would help motivate the paper better."
