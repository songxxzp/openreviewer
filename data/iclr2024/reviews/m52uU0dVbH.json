This is suggested both by intuition and Lemma 2, i.e., it grows proportional to the inverse square of the minimum sub-optimality gap and to the number of total arms, which grows exponentially in number of individuals arms to be selected, therefore rendering E-TS' practical utility very limited in my opinion. For instance, I would like to see what happens when the number of clients to be selected is increased from 2 or 3 to, say, 7-8 in Figure 4. There is a vast literature on \"combinatorial\" MABs which could offer better solutions to this problem with lesser assumptions, e.g., by imposing and exploiting some sort of structure between the arms."

                "value": "The VFL setting as explained at the top of Section 2 is puzzling. This implies that a prediction query arrives simultaneously at all M clients.  But even in the given setting, why does the server need to broadcast the full probability vector, rather than the class with the maximal value? Is there a notion of a primary query client? Or is it more realistic that the query comes to the central server which then asks clients for their representations? \n\nWhat was the loss function L (in eqn (3), etc.) adopted in the experimental settings? \n\nWhy is the constant \\alpha^* needed in (4)? The later discussion in Sec 5.2 that the mean reward corresponding to the best arm (client subset) can be taken to be \\alpha^* is also confusing. The adversary does not know \\alpha^*, so how can it proceed to solve (4)? \n\nAlgorithm 1:\n- Please identify the inputs: t_o, {B_t, t=1,..,T} and the corresponding embeddings \u2026.. \n- After line 11, shouldn\u2019t there be a call to Alg 2 to compute the corrupted embeddings? \n- Line 6 should be in plural \n- Line 13: are the rewards assumed to be positive? \n- The role of \\phi is not clear. Let n(t) be the number of times a given arm is played, and let r(j) denote the corresponding rewards. Then \\phi = \\frac{1}{n(t)} \\sum_{j=1}^{n(t)} \\max(r_i, i=1,\u2026j). Why is this an useful quantity to compute\n-  What is the reward? Is it merely the ASR over the batch? With reference to Remark 1 and the discussion of [Gupta et al., 2021], is the reward in this setting simply 0 or 1 (so max=1)? \n \nExperiments\nGiven that the value of N is small in all the settings (M takes values of 6, 7, 8 and 10, and C = 2,3,4), it would have been insightful to show how the best arm selection changes over t \\in [1, T]. It would also have been insightful to show how the size of the restricted set decrease with t. \n\nThe choice of datasets is poorly motivated for the VFL problem. The credit score and Caltech datasets are reasonable, but segmenting a CIFAR or MNIST image into segments, or an IMDB review at different clients is not reasonable. \n\nA value of Q=1000 is outrageously large. Servers with any reasonable security settings would turn off queries if they are repeated more than 3 or 5 times. A large Q is simply a mechanism for an adversary to learn (more samples). Q = 1000 is not a reasonable number. \nWhat were the default values of \\beta, B^t, T and C?\n\nThe \u201cAblation study\u201d is not particularly helpful. That the adversary\u2019s success rate would increase with \\beta, T, or C is obvious. This does not add any insights. Further discussion on choosing t_o would be useful. \n\nIn Figure 1 what do the curves \u2018Client 4 5\u2019 etc. mean? Why are different client pairs shown in different plots? What is a test epoch and what does 25 attack rounds/test epoch mean? Does this mean that B^t is fixed at 25? And that T  was 30 (judging from the figures)?\nThere is little difference between TS and E-TS after about 5 epochs. What is the corresponding complexity comparison? The log(T) to O(1) improvement does not seem to show up here. \n\nFigure 2: Fashion MNIST has 7 clients; so even with all 7 clients corrupted, manifold defense does pretty well. This is a surprising and unexpected result. \n\nFigures 2, 3 (and parts of 1): Figures showing performance results on Credit Score or the Caltech dataset would have been more meaningful. More specifically, recognition of MNSIT / Fashion MNIST / CIFAR does not require all pieces of the full image; neither does sentiment analysis of a review; further, as noted earlier, such segmentation is unrealistic in any case. \n\nFigure 4: What is the setting with 16 and 28 clients? How were the images segmented? Is it meaningful to have a 28-pixel image segment at each of 28 clients? \n\nTheoretical results\nLemma 1, Lemma 2, and Theorem 1 appear to have an implicit large N assumption.  The lower bound on the probability is negative for N < 55, and exceeds 0.5 at about N=150. \n\nHow does the proposed E-TS algorithm work compared to sequential arm elimination proposed in \nS. Shahrampour, M. Noshad and V. Tarokh. On Sequential Elimination Algorithms for Best-Arm Identification in Multi-Armed Bandits. IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 65, no. 16, pp. 4281-4292, 15 Aug.15, 2017 \n\nIs a factor 2 missing in the equation for Fact 1?\n\nIn the proof of Lemma 4, shouldn\u2019t the = sign be <= on line 5. The transition from line 6 to line 7 (\u201cg\u201d) is not clear. \n\nProof of Lemma 5: The fact that \u2026 towards the end of the proof is not obvious; it holds asymptotically; why does it hold for all T?\n\nProof of Theorem 1: Please add proof details. The terse statements are insufficient. \n\nPuzzling statement in Section 3: \u201c\u03b2 \u2208 [0, 1] is the perturbation budget of some simple magnitude-based anomaly detector.\u201d Whose anomaly detector, and why is it assumed to be simple?\n\n\n\nBefore (2): \u201ctaking over\u201d should be \u201ctaken over\u201d. \n\nP6, line 7: \u201cobtain\u201d should be \u201cobtains\u201d. \n\nThe sentence about the large exploration space (below Fig 1 and Fig 2) is confusing.

            "questions": {
                "value": "Questions:\n1) For the VFL inference setting, one point is not clear for me: the server broadcasts the probabilities vector back to all the clients for the inference. However, it would be more cost-saving to broadcast only the label. In this scenario, it would be harder to design attacks. Is there any reason that the client must receive the probability vector for the inference? \n\n2) I would like to see the discussion on how easy/difficult this attack can be noticed by the server. For me, it seems that targeted attack could be easily identified by the server. If the server observes that for test sample queries, the probability vector evolution converges to the same label, i.e., there might be an attack. Then one na\u00efve way to mitigate this attack is that the server sends back always the probability vector obtained by using the first embedding query to avoid the training of $\\eta_i^t$. Actually, I do not see the interest for the server to answer $n$ queries of the same test sample (line 10 in Algo 2) which helps the attacker to find the best perturbation.   \n\n3) From my intuition, untargeted attack should be easier than the targeted one. If one can succeed the targeted attack with ASR $r$ on label $x$, then one would expect the untargeted one should be at least $r$ on label $y != x$. More precisely, let $r(x)$ be the targeted ASR on label $x$, the untargeted one on label $y$ should be better than $max$ {$r(x)|\\forall x!=y$}. In the experiment, the results on FashionMNIST confirms this intuition, whileas the results on CIFAR-10 gives opposite observation. Could authors provide more explanation for this observation? Besides, what are the untargeted labels used in the experiments? \n\n4) In Figure 3c, when the query budget decreases to 500 for FashionMNIST, the targeted attack accuracy reaches almost 10%, which is equivalent to the ASR of no-attack case if the sample is randomly split in the batch.  The same observation can be found in Figure 5c when there is only one corrupted channel. Does it mean that when the query budget is limited or the number of corrupted channels is limited, applying the proposed method has smaller or even no advantage than doing nothing for targeted attack? What impacts the minimum necessary query budget and the minimum required number of corrupted channels? The complexity of the dataset, model or the scale of the system? I would like to have more insight on this problem.       \n\nMinors:\n\n1) The settings for each Figure are not well-indicated, especially for the ablation study. For example, in Figure 3, when we vary one parameter, what are the default values for the other parameters."
