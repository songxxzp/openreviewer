(2019a), where the growth w.r.t the depth and width is logarithmic, in this case it\u2019s polynomial. This exponential blow-up in the value of bound makes the whole exercise somewhat underwhelming. \n\nAlso its worth mentioning that the discretization dependence in Theorem 4.1 is through the constants K1^D and K2^D\n - and these two critical quantities don't seem defined anywhere in the main paper! This makes the theorem highly opaque! \n\nThe entire point why a generalization error bound is interesting is because it reveals the generalization error to be independent of some natural size parameter of the system. Like, most often the baseline achievement of a Rademacher bound for a neural system is to show that at a fixed depth and norm bound on the weights involved the generalization is width independent. In this bound, in this work, there is absolutely no such thing happening - the bound in Theorem 4.1 is worsening with every such parameter with which naively one would have expected worsening to happen! \n\nThe numerical Illustrations also seem incomplete in the absence of any demonstration of how well the bounds hold up in the cases mentioned there. In the bare minimum, in Figure 4 kind of experiments one would have expected to see a scatter plot of the theoretical bound and the true generalization error as the sampling gap, time and avg. max path variation is changed. Such a scatter plot would have revealed if there is at all any correlation between the theoretical bound and the truth."
