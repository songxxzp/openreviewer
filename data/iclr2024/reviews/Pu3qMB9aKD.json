The authors propose a new fine-tuning method in which LM fine-tuning and message-passing (MP) are interleaved. Empirical results indicate the effectiveness of the approach. \n\nThe problem in question is interesting, but I have some concerns:\n\n(1) the technical contribution is not clear to me.  It seems that interleaving with MP is the only technical contribution, however, when the number of fine-tuning examples increases, the model without MP can achieve much better performance (half MAE on QED), then what will happen if we fine-tune the model on 400k examples with MP? is it possible that w/ MP and w/o MP are comparable when there are enough fine-tuning examples? Moreover, why the results on QED and Valency are inconsistent on 400k examples? \n\n(2) the presentation needs improvement. I find conflict in some descriptions. For example, in the third line from the bottom in Page 4, it is said that \"regen only differs from our proposed model SGG-LLM without message passing in that it was trained using equation 2 instead of 1\" but in the third line from the top in Page 16, it is said that \"regen is a model trained with equuation 1\". I am confused with such presentations. Then what is the true difference between the proposed method and the baseline? It is also important to highlight the major contributions in Introduction."

If the evaluation benchmark can be derived from previous works with little modification, why not using the same benchmark and metrics in previous works? The authors should thoroughly address the suitability of the datasets and metrics. Baselines are also inadequately explored, and the results are far from convincing.\n* The technical contribution is also limited. The primary contribution emphasized by the authors involves the use of causal masks during generation. However, the employment of causal masks for autoregressive generation is just a trick to ensure efficient training.

As per Figure 1, is the reason that graph masking includes a self node (node i attends to node i) the same reason that causal masking has a token attending to itself? Is there any specific reason not to exclude that self node?\n\n3. What is the reasoning for the formulation of the denominator in Eqn 1, and why must it differ from Eqn 2 for training on serialized graph sequences? Seems there is a missing explanation in the paragraph right under Eqn 2.\n\n4. The feature vector for a node vector was selected as the feature vector of the last element describing that node. Were there any experiments done to vary this, for e.g. mean-pooling?\n\n5. Why was BLOOM selected as the LLM backbone?\n\n6. With reference to Table 3, why was parsability affected when using message passing?\n\n7. With reference to Table 2, it seems that much of the improvement of SGG-LLM was in fine-tuning on the QED/Valency dataset. Moreover, the MAE on the QED dataset shows that the performance improvement when enabling message passing is not statistically significant (0.036 +/- 0.005, vs 0.044 +/- 0.011). Can the authors please highlight arguments for why the message passing inductive bias is working correctly, and what might be the issue in the current approach?\n\n\n**Suggestions**:\n- In Section 1, the paragraph on causal masking seems out of place. Suggest moving it to Section 3.1 before introducing causal graph masking.\n- It is difficult to distinguish between the colours used in Tables 2 and 3. Would suggest finding a more accessibility-friendly solution, like using icons to distinguish between rows."
