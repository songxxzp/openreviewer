Each point-wise local shape transform can map the SO(3)-equivariant global shape descriptor of the input shape to a local shape descriptor, which is passed to the decoder to reconstruct the shape and pose of the input point cloud. \n\nThe proposed self-supervised training pipeline encourages semantically corresponding points from different shape instances to be mapped to similar local shape descriptors, enabling LSTNet to establish dense point-wise correspondences via nearest point pairs between cross-reconstructed point clouds."

                "value": "1. The novelty of this work seems insufficient for ICLR. The whole pipeline heavily relies on VNNs and the main contribution I personally consider is the local shape transform and the self-supervised mechanism for correspondences.\n\n2. Regarding the local shape transform:\n   2.1. From 3.1.1, the SO(3)-invariant output is $\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{U}^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C \\times C}$, while in 3.1.2, the obtained SO(3)-invariant features $\\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C^\\prime \\times 3 \\times N}$ have a different shape;\n\n   2.2 The authors claimed that the local shape transform transforms the global features to local ones. Regarding this, I have two questions. \n\n      2.2.1 First, why are the features obtained by the Encoder global? They are generated by a DGCNN-based VNN, but DGCNN is not guaranteed to capture the global context, as it is graph-based and really depends on the number of layers together with the number of rings of each layer. \n\n      2.2.2 Second, the so-called local shape transform is predicted by a multi-layer perception from some SO(3)-invariant features that obtained from the input. Why after transforming the \"global\" features by such a mechanism, the features turn to \"local\"? I cannot see any specific design that enables it. It should be further explained. (I personally do not think so)\n\n3. Regarding the experiments:\n    3.1 The experiments are only conducted on synthetic data, which cannot support the proposed method can work for real applications. I think it would be better to have additional real-data experiments;\n\n     3.2 As this paper also targets on correspondence estimation, whose typical downstream task is pose estimation. Therefore, I consider it worthwhile to also conduct experiments on tasks of 6D pose estimation or point cloud registration (there you always use real data), to further validate the estimated correspondences.\n\n    3.3 In Tab.1, only CPAE proposed in 2021 is used as the baseline. Some recent methods, e.g., [1], should also be included. Otherwise the results are not convincing at all (only compared to a single baseline which was proposed years ago). And it seems CPAE is the only baseline method for all the experiments. More baselines are required on both tasks.\n\n   3.4 The method is claimed to generate SO(3)-invariant correspondences. However, in Tab. 1, even on the synthetic data, the I/SO(3) and SO(3)/SO(3) experiments perform unsimilarly (I would expect to have similar results per category, as it is on synthetic and clean data). Could this be explained?\n\n4. For the SO(3)-equivariant and -invariant methods, some works for point cloud registration [2, 3, 4, 5] should also be discussed.\n---------------------------------------------\n[1]. Zohaib et al.

While the experiments on ShapeNet is common in the community and shows good result, I am in general doubtful whether such an approach could be really applied to the real world. \nIn motivation, the authors talk about usage in vision, graphics, and robotics. In vision and robotics, we are interested in fitting real-world scans to templates (e.g. [Scan2CAD, CVPR 2019]), where in most cases, only noisy, partial, and sparse point clouds are provided. The authors do not have experiments or discussions in such cases. \n\nThe authors also take groundtruth keypoints and semantic segmentations from datasets for the experiments. In the real-world, however, obtaining such accurate high-level semantic information already requires a deep understanding of the point cloud, and its segmentation backbone may already be SO(3) invariant. This impairs the strength that the authors proposed."

Will the network still be functional if the density distributions are different across input and output? \n3. Will it work out of the 16-category domain? Do we need more training data, or would it work out-of-box?\n4. Would non-gt and/or biased key points and semantic parts be transferred properly?\n\nIt would be nice if the authors could conduct a minimal set of experiments in the real-world setup (e.g., extract a reconstruction from a ScanNet model and attempt to apply keypoint/semantic part transfer). Otherwise, it would be good to see a justification that this paper itself is an inevitable intermediate step toward real-world usage, and what can be done to further extend it."

                "value": "This paper presents a method of learning dense 3D correspondence between shapes in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, it is built on an existing SO(3)-equivariant representation. The input point clouds are independently encoded to SO(3)-equivariant global shape descriptor Z and dynamic SO(3)-invariant point-wise local shape transforms. Then the network is trained via penalizing errors in self- and cross- reconstructions via the decoder. The experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main issue of the proposed method lies in the experimental evaluation. Only one learned-based method is adopted for comparison in the main paper on a rather simple dataset. More methods including some traditional methods should be also evaluated for better comparison. The experiment on the real dataset should be also provided to show the robustness of the proposed method. \n2. From Fig. 6 in the supplementary, we can see that the performance of the proposed method on the I/I scenario is much worse than the SOTA method. More analysis of the drop of performance should be given. Moreover, the performance of different methods with different rotation angles should be provided for better comparison.\n3. How about the performance of other methods with a rough alignment of the initial shape? If a rough alignment is enough for the existing methods, why should we learn SO(3)-invariant correspondence in an end-to-end manner?\n4. The whole method is mainly built upon the existing SO(3)-equivariant representation. The main contribution lies in introducing this representation to the specific task. I didn't get too much novel insight in terms of network design."
