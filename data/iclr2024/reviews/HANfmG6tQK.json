                "value": "LARS proportionally scale the learning rate at each layer to improve stability in large batch learning. However, it is well known that LARS suffer from sluggish convergence at early stages of training, hence requiring a warmup procedure. This paper hypothesizes and empirically verifies that LARS tend to fall into sharp minimizers at the initial stages of training, leading to an explosion of the adaptively scaled gradient. As a result, this paper proposes TVLARS, and verify on experiments that TVLARS outperform LARS with warmup."

Based on the above analysis, they propose a  novel algorithm Time Varying LARS (TVLARS) to make the initial training phrase stable without the need of warm-up. The experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet also illustrates that the proposed method can further improve the performance of LARS and LAMB for large-batch training."

For your proposed method, I think we need to tune more hyper-parameters to get a great performance, which may make the proposed method less convenient to use. \n3.

(3), the layer-wise learning rate depends on the weight norm of each layer since the gradient is normalized. Therefore, I think the reason why the initial training process is unstable is related to the initialization method. So my question is whether you try to use different initialization methods and analyze their results."
