                "value": "Preventing performance degradation of Transformers on inputs longer than the training sequence lengths has posed a significant challenge in expanding the context length of these models. While the Transformer architecture inherently has no limitations on the input sequence lengths it can handle, the choice of position encoding during training can limit their performance on longer inputs. To address this, the author propose a novel approach called Functional Interpolation with Relative Encoding (FIRE), which aims to enhance Transformer's generalization to longer contexts. The author provide theoretical evidence that FIRE can effectively represent popular relative position encodings like T5's RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. Furthermore, The author empirically demonstrate that the FIRE models exhibit improved generalization to longer contexts in both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks."

                "value": "Although the performance of the model presented in this paper is impressive, I believe there are several shortcomings:\n\n1. Heavy reliance on handcrafted input features: The authors attempt to use a neural network to learn a relative position encoding. However, the input features of this network still heavily rely on manual design. Although some ablation experiments are conducted in section B.1, I believe the baseline should be a simpler approach like b(i, j) = f(i - j). For example, [1], [2] has achieved good results by learning relative positional relationships using a similar approach.\n\n2. Trade-off between efficiency and performance: Compared to Alibi and RoPE, the learnable FIRE raises the question of how much slower it makes the training process for language modeling. However, this aspect is not mentioned in the paper. Therefore, the authors need to evaluate and discuss the training speed.\n\n3. Lack of certain baselines: For instance, the paper fails to compare its approach with NTK-RoPE[3], YaRN[4], and NTK-ALiBi[5]. These methods have also made advancements in relative position encoding. The absence of comparison with these baselines is a drawback.\n\n\nCitations:\n[1] Zhen Qin, Xiaodong Han, Weixuan Sun, Bowen He, Dong Li, Dongxu Li, Yuchao Dai, Lingpeng Kong, and Yiran Zhong.

I\u2019m wondering about the model performance of using Eq. 21 on GLUE/SuperGLUE.\n\n* Also regarding the thresholding parameter, it is mentioned that the parameter $L$ is learnable. Could the authors demonstrate what the learned parameter $L$ looks like after training? Also, will model performance significantly change if we set $L$ to a fixed value?\n\n* Another weakness is that FIRE is not better than existing methods when the sequence length is short. Even with the thresholding parameter and the slower inference speed, it seems FIRE is not better than RoPE on GLUE/SuperGLUE."
