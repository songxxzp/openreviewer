The authors argue that this type of message passing is inefficient with complexity of O(D m ), where D is the diameter of graph and m is the number of edges.\n\nAs an alternative, the authors propose \u201cFlood and Echo\u201d which propagates messages in a wave like pattern throughout the entire graph. Starting from a center node, \u201cFlood and Echo\u201d  floods the messages outwards, then the flow reverses and is echoed back. The authors claims this could reduce the complexity to O(m), where m is the number of edges.\n\nThe presentation of this paper can be improved. Besides, I have doubt on the complexity part, authors need better explaination on this."

If we want the node representation of a node that is not the chosen start node, what is its node representation's computaiton graph?\n\nThe flood and echo mainly focused on the forward propagation part. But how its gradient are computed? To compute the gradient for weight parameters, we have to use the \u201cgradient with respect to hidden representations output\u201d and \u201cthe input node representation that multiplied to the weight parameters\u201d. In flood and echo, it seems like we have to save the hidden embeddings for each node to compute gradient?\n\nCompared to ordinary message passing GNN, the major difference if the selection of neighbors and the number of propagation steps (aka the number of layers in GNN). In order to propagate information to the full graph, the proposed \u201cflood and echo\u201d requires twice the propagation steps of ordinary message passing GNN due to echo back. I am not sure I understand this correctly and how this can benefit in terms of efficiency.\n\nThe \"flood\" part seems to me is the forward propagation of ordinary GNN, where this GNN's depth is the diameter of the graph?"

In other words, the inductive bias given by such a message-passing procedure may be put into question. \n\nW2) While the authors aim to answer \"i) How can we enable nodes to gather the required information in a given graph (information exchange), even if is far away\", the authors do not relate this to existing work on over-squashing [1, 2].
