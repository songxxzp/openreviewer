For example, in eq.(6) $\\theta$ is used to represent a function (the GNN model in my understanding), while in eq.(10) $\\theta$ is used to represent the parameters of the model.\n    - There are some imprecise terms. \n        - From (3) to (4) the authors say \"The problem (eq.(3)) can be rewritten as a joint objective (eq.(4))\". I don't see how eq.(3) can be rewritten as eq.(4). Indeed eq.(4) is a relaxed version eq.(3), but they are not equavalent. Doing such relaxation usually requires some related properties of the two problems, e.g. they share the same global optima. For the eq.(3) to eq.(4), I don't see such a relation, at least the authors didn't mention any.\n        - In section 4, there's a sentence \"Without loss of generality, the adaptive Lipschitz regularization in (9) can be equivalently replaced by a logarithmic counterpart\". I don't see how relacing a part of a equation by its logarithmic counterpart while leaving other parts unchanged is without loss of generality. It's likely eq.(9) and eq.(10) have different global optima. I would suggest the authors just add the log in the original definition eq.(9).\n- For the two stage approach, I don't see why it can converge. The given theorem only proves the convergence of the joint optimization approach. \n- The experiments are performed only on small graphs. I wonder what is the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and if it is limited on small graphs?\n- The proof of Theorem 1 is looks problematic. Overall, I think it's unlikely that the Lipschitz constant depends only on the parameters but not on the activation function and the structure of the GNN.\n    - For the first inequal symbol in eq.(2) in the appendix, how is $\\sigma$ disapeared? Doesn't this require $\\sigma$ to be $1$-Lipschitz?\n    - The proof of Theorem 1 assums a very specific structure of GNN (basically GCN), which mismatches the definition of GNN given in section 2.1. The authors should state it explicitly that it works only for a specific implementation of GNN in the statement of  Theorem 1. Alternatively, you can also assume $\\mathcal M$ and $\\mathcal U$ are Lipschitz continous and combine the Lipschitz constant of them into the bound."
