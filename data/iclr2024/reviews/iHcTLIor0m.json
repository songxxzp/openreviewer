It seems the Eq. (22) is the poly-view contrative loss, whereas it is in a very high level abstract and implicit form, making it hard to interprete how to compute the empirical loss for the terms, and why M=2 links to SimCLR. I recommend to make the loss in a more explicit form of empirical losses and interpretation (e.g., what is the used sufficient statistics for M=2 for SimCLR? ) \n\nW2: Empirical evidence lacks suitable interpretation and linkage to the significance of the theorems. For significance, I mean how we can use the theorem takeaways to practically improve the SSL algorithms? I expect to see the evidence on larger dataset with mainstream architecture such as ResNet and ViT/transformer with longer epochs. \n\nW3: It is unclear to me if the multiplicity of views simply benefits from more equivalent of epochs (in the experiments) or whether the exposure to the number of data has been constrained to be exactly same between the poly-view contrastive learning and other baselines. \n\nW4: There is no comparison between the proposed method and SOTA method, in terms of how the method contributes to and improves the SOTA methods under the theoretical foundations."
