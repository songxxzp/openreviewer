For example, are the centroids of $k$-means method re-computed on the target domain? I wonder if the scores are obtained by just using the nearest neighbor rule with the centroids obtained on the source domain. If so, I don't think it is a fair comparison because the proposed algorithm re-computed their centroids on the target centroids. The centroids of $k$-means also can be easily updated without fine-tuning or something. \n\n2. I'm not sure that the experiment scenario is aligned with the objective of the proposed algorithm. It uses training set and test set as source and target domain, respectively. However, in general, they are from the same distribution. So, I think that the experimental results are not convincing enough to support the claims in the paper.\n\n3. For the same reason I mentioned above (in 2), it would be much better to show the cross-domain adaptation results. For example, trained on MNIST and tested on DIGITS. \n\n4. Thus, in overall, I think that the novelty of the proposed algorithm is not enough as well as the experimental results. The scoring function with the learnable matrix is not novel and centroid update module is also basically the same with the k-means except for the scoring function. Also, the experimental results are only provided on a few toy datasets. So, in my opinion, some more experimental results on more diverse datasets (not toy datasets) should be provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm.\n\n5. I think the theorems are very straight forward in overall. So, of course, it can inspire some readers but I don't think they are meaningful enough to be considered as contribution of this paper."
