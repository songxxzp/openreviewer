One key aspect of current LLMs is their context window, and how to use it efficiently. The authors should provide evidence relating to the extra overhead on training/inference of JsonTuning.\n*  It is not also obvious to transform the user's request into a structured format. Despite the authors' arguments on the generalization capability of JsonTuning, structured object like Json still lags far behind natural language in terms of expressivity. The tasks concerned in the work are relatively easy and can be transformed into json format with less effort. However, I am not convinced this generalizes to real industrial use cases where the user's request could be far more complex.\n* A simple question: assume a user requests the model to produce output following json format at the first place. Then how the output control be defined on the input side? I suppose it would be a nested json and could be fragile for the model to take as input."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Despite the commendable performance exhibited by JsonTuning, there are still several notable weaknesses:\n\n**Introduction of Additional Knowledge in Input**: The utilization of Json formatting can aid models in generating outputs that conform to the constraints specified in the Json input. However, it also introduces supplementary knowledge, such as information pertaining to input and output types, which is originally absent in the unstructured textual instructions. To facilitate a fair comparison, it becomes essential to incorporate the information present in the Json input but absent in the textual input into the original text instructions. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of whether the Json format indeed outperforms the text format.\n\n**Potential Incompleteness of Generalization Experiments**: While the training dataset encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including Flan and P3++, there appears to be some overlap between the types of tasks assessed during testing and those encountered in training. It is pertinent to explore whether the model can adeptly generalize to entirely unseen task types, which may not have been covered by the training data. Furthermore, the evaluation tasks, primarily centered on structure prediction, demand output format constraints. However, for the field of instruction tuning, there exists a research interest in user-oriented instruction following evaluation, exemplified by AlpacaEval. In cases involving more open-ended instruction data, the Json format may not bring additional benefits since there are no specific constraints imposed on the output format. It also remains uncertain how the model performs on the Super-NI test set, a widely employed dataset assessing a model's ability to follow instructions.\n\n**Challenges for Real-World Applications**: The practical applicability of Json-tuned models is constrained by the need to manually craft complex Json prompts that delineate output fields and their corresponding types. For users lacking expertise in computer science, utilizing such models proves challenging, as they may lack the proficiency required to construct a Json-formatted instruction. Unless a method for automatically generating Json instructions becomes available, the utility of this approach is notably limited in real-world scenarios."
