To augment static datasets with useful synthetic samples, the research designs a framework that utilises pre-trained image generation models to provide useful and diverse synthetic samples that are close to the support of real data distributions to improve the representation learning task. This paper lays the groundwork for the effective use of state-of-the-art text-to-image models as data sources that can be queried to improve downstream applications."

For active learning methods, in addition to the confidence-based or entropy-based approach, margin margin-based approach is also possible. For the recent active learning criteria, such as BALD [1], VAAL [2], or MCDAL [3]. To claim the contribution of a complete research paper, the authors should devise an idea to leverage such recent active learning methods to find more novel solutions suitable for this problem.\n[1] Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data. ICML 2017.\n[2] Variational Adversarial Active Learning. ICCV 2019.\n[3] MCDAL: Maximum Classifier Discrepancy for Active Learning. TNNLS 2022.\n\n- Also, instead of simply comparing among na\u00efve active learning criteria, how about combining multiple losses (at least linear combination in the loss)? That would be more novel than the proposed solution.\n\n- The experiment is also too weak. For the datasets, The authors only use ImageNet and NICO++. However, according to other recent Long-tailed recognition papers, they usually evaluate their methods on iNaturalist and Place-LT datasets to demonstrate the scalability. At least the authors should have evaluated their method on CIFAR datasets to show the effectiveness of their methods on other datasets.\n\n- Also, a comparison with more recent state-of-the-art long-tailed recognition papers is missing. For example, CMO [4] is one of the recent long-tailed recognition methods based on sample synthesis. To claim the usefulness of the proposed method, the authors should compare the proposed method with recent long-tailed recognition papers, including [4].\n[4] The Majority Can Help The Minority: Context-rich Minority Oversampling for Long-Tailed Classification. CVPR 2022.\n\n- More analysis of the detailed design choices. For example, how are the hyper-parameters decided, such as w in Eqns (5), (6), (8)? As the authors proposed to add additional criteria, it would be necessary to analyze the effect of w on the performance."
