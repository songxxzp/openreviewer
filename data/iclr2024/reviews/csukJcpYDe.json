It is based on an explicit representation of the advantage function, again in tensor-train format, and the use of the TT-Cross algorithm for an efficient TT approximation of the advantage function after it has been computed by means of a Bellman back-up.\n\nAnother strength of the paper is the rather impressive verification of the algorithm on control problem with six continuous state variables and a single discrete variable, on a real robot."

                "value": "Although the example on the real robot is very impressive, the examples in simulation are less so. Four-dimensional state space is not that high, barely beyond what can be represented with a look-up table on modern computers. (10^8 cells will take around 400MB of FP numbers.) The authors clearly state that their algorithm is not meant to approximate value functions on very high-dimensional state spaces, such as images, but most robotics applications on 6 degree of freedom robots have 12-dimensional state space, so this is perhaps the dimensionality of highest interest. \n\nSome claims are not entirely justified. For example, the authors say \"OC is synonymous with ADP\". There is some overlap, but the two fields are hardly the same. Many OC algorithms, including the celebrated LQR and LQG algorithms, are based on basic DP, nothing approximate about it. \n\nFurthermore, the authors say that MuJoCo is not parallelizable. I cannot agree with this, MuJoCo has always been easy to parallelize on multiple CPU cores, and the latest release of MuJoCo, 3.0.0, can run on GPUs and TPUs. True, it came out after ICLR papers were submitted, but please reconsider this claim.\n\nThe authors also mention \"the need for differentiability of the system dynamics and reward function which is a common assumption in the existing ADP algorithms\". This is probably not entirely correct, as many ADP algorithms simply sample the system dynamics. \n\nFurthermore, the authors often use the phrase \"policy retrieval\", implying that somehow the policy has been lost. Suggest replacing with \"policy computation\" or \"policy evaluation\".\n\nSome minor typos:\nAppendix A.3: citation missing in the first sentence \nSame place: \"n=6 states\" -> \"n=6 state\" (completely changes the meaning)\n\"HZ\" -> \"Hz\""

In addition, policy $\\pi$ is built on these iterations using the known TTGO algorithm, which searches for the maximum of the TT-tensor based on sampling from it. The performance of the algorithm was tested on several model and real robot examples, showing its superiority on them. The distinctive feature of the algorithm is the use of hybrid actions."
