The trained sampler matches conditional distributions and recovers marginals, making it effective for inference in partial variable subsets. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency for synthetic PGMs and latent variable models with sparse structures."

The discussion of prior works is thorough and well-structured, and the paper offers promising avenues for future research.\n- The paper develops a novel algorithm namely, \u0394-AI that offers substantially faster training when compared to regular GFlowNets and other amortized inference methods, since each training step involves only a small subset of variables, resulting in negligible sampling costs. Furthermore, the memory cost associated with \u0394-AI is exceptionally low, since the algorithm leverages the sparsity of the probabilistic graphical model to compute the gradient update locally over a small set of variables. Lastly \u0394-AI provides the advantage of flexible probabilistic inference by amortizing numerous potential sampling orders into a single sampler, by learning Bayesian networks with multiple Markov-equivalent structures."

This local constraint makes GFlowNets more efficient both in terms of memory and time since only the few relevant variables can be used in each training step. The proposed inference algorithm is tested on a sytnetic data set as well as MNIST data and outperforms vanilla GFlowNets and other amortized inference algorithms."

For example why not use the DELTA-AI loss within PixelVAE and try inference on natural images?\n\n2.
