Since causal relationships ($C$) consist of dynamic ($D$) and static ($S$) relationships, there should exist $P(S) = P(C) - P(D)$. I guess this equation is derived from it, but I can't see the logical derivation.\n\nW3. This paper still has not well addressed the interpretability issue of DyGNNs. The authors only provide evidence in performance improvements and static interpretability ('house' motif in BA-Shapes). We can not observe specific causal relationships in dynamic graphs from provided results. Besides, the baselines are interpretability methods conducted on static graphs, and the datasets are not classic dynamic graph datasets, such as traffic and citation network datasets. Thus, this proposed solution does not satisfy the expectation that exploring the interpretability of dynamic graph.\n\nW4.

The authors should include complexity descriptions to inform the reader. However, these issues are not discussed in the paper.\n\n(2) The proposal of 4 loss functions can be unfriendly to network training.
