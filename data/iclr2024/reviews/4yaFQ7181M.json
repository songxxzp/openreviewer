                "value": "The paper addresses the problem of limitations in traditional physical simulations, which rely on numerical schemes and mesh-refinement methods to balance precision and complexity. The proposed methodology is based on a double observation challenge, which involves extracting regularities from weakly informative physical variables that are sparsely measured in space and time. The authors propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain. System 1 is a discrete dynamical model used to compute a sequence of latent anchor states z_d auto-regressively, while System 2 is used to design a state estimator q retrieving the dense physical state at arbitrary locations (x, t). The proposed methodology has several potential implications and effectiveness. First, it allows for predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain, which is not possible with traditional methods. Second, it is trained on sparse observations, making it highly adaptable and efficient. Third, the proposed method is generalizable and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems."

However, it lacks a comprehensive description of the neural network architecture employed. Clarification is needed on how the model systematically handles and compensates for missing data, as this is a crucial aspect for the practical application and reliability of the proposed method.\n\n2. While the document mentions the use of a specific optimization algorithm for training the model, it omits essential details like the learning rate schedule and batch size. A more thorough examination and justification of the chosen hyperparameters, including regularization parameters and the number of hidden layers, is necessary to ensure replicability and to provide insights into the model's design choices.\n\n3. The paper criticizes traditional physical simulations based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and numerical algorithms for their limitations in complex phenomena and handling sparse observations. It is imperative to acknowledge the extensive success and development of these traditional methods across various applications over the years. Data-driven methods, despite showing potential in overcoming some of these limitations, bring their own set of challenges and limitations. These include the substantial data requirements for training and the often opaque nature of these models, which can make interpretation and validation of results challenging. It would be beneficial for the authors to provide a balanced view, comparing the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches to give readers a comprehensive understanding of the context in which their work sits."

                "value": "While the method works well in practice for the presented datasets, I think that the authors could highlight better the hypothesis behind their model. On the one hand, they correctly highlight how DINo (Yin et al. 2022) assumes the existence of a learnable ODE that models the system dynamics. On the other hand, the authors' approach hypothesizes the existence of a Markovian discrete system that is able to represent the advance in time. This is an equivalently strong hypothesis in my opinion. Furthermore, we assume that an latent space $\\mathbf{z}_d$ can be found using an encoder. This is even more relevant since they perform the time advancement in the latent space: with a scheme \"encode-process-decode\" at each timestep, the encoder needs to take care only of the spatial representation, instead in this case the temporal dynamics also need to be embedded."

                "value": "- I would consider adding a bit more information about the weaknesses highlighted before, while they do not change the results, they can provide a more clear picture of the limitations of the model\n- In the introduction, the model from Yin et al. (2022) does satisfy R3, so it would be better to correct the statement there\n- The loss function (eq. 13) has two terms, did you check how the balance of the two terms affects the solution?\n- The author state that there is a trade-off in the performance of $\\phi_q$. Did you train different models to quantify it? What is the dependence of the performance on the training sequence division (q) and length (T). How is it related with the timescales of the physical phenomena tested?\n\n- minor: typo in fig.1, where $\\phi_q$ is $\\phi_p$\n\nAs a final observation, the model performs well but in my opinion the tasks considered are a bit simplistic and do not really highlight the limitations of the proposed models.\nIt would be better to focus on more challenging benchmarks (for instance Biferale et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07469) in order to bring these models closer to actual applications."
