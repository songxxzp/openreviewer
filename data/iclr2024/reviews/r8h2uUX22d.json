Examples are eq (1), eq (2). The plots are also hard to interpret, and more explanation could be better. The general structure of the paper could also be improved, to have a more coherent story. For example, section 3.2 could be merged with section 5.\n2. The contribution is weak. For example, while it's good to formalize the relationship between MLP mixer and wide MLP, it's not that unexpected. From figure 1(d), it seems like the equivalent MLP under-performs the MLP-Mixer which makes the equivalence argument weak. The random permuted mixers also don't consistently out-perform the vanilla mixer which is also a weak argument."
