The goal seems to be to reduce the number of queries needed in order to learn the ground truth labels.\n\nAfter developing a merging criterion based on normalized mutual information, a new active clustering method is proposed which the authors call active probabilistic clustering.  The idea is to construct appropriate sampling probabilities for pairs of clusters and to sample several pairs of clusters and query representatives from each cluster in order to make merging/splitting decisions.  Many experiments are carried out for this method, showing improvements to normalized mutual information and adjusted rand index using fewer queries than baseline methods."

The actual objective and performance metrics are not clearly described or motivated in Sections 1 or 2.  I think it would help the reader to develop the objective for the problem more formally and contextualize prior work within this objective.\n\nAdditionally, without more care towards formalizing the problem setting and any mathematical models, I believe there are serious issues with how this paper is written.  In particular more care is needed to define the probability space and random variables that are being worked with to clarify the equations.  For example, Equation (2), seems to be wrong as written.  The LHS of this equation, ${\\mathbb P}(w_i = w_j \\mid w_i,w_j)$  has to either be 1 or 0, while the RHS does not.  The reason the LHS should be 1 or 0 is that once we've conditioned on the two random variables $w_i, w_j$, they are deterministically either the same or different.  If something else is meant, then this has to be clearly defined and communicated.  Similar issues hold for equations (3) and (4) as well."

Even though the paper's main contribution is an algorithm, a clear description of the algorithm is missing in the main write-up.

For instance, consider the description of Algorithm 1 -- Algorithms 2 and 3 are deferred to the Appendix without giving the intuition regarding what they do. It is unclear what \"Implement Human Test on w_1 and w_2\" means.\n- Theorem 2 gives some conditions under which cluster fusion gives an improvement. Are there reasons to believe such conditions could hold in natural clustering settings? Can these conditions be tested? Do these conditions continue to hold after a sequence of fusion operations?\n- Does the initial clustering algorithm (FPC) use any queries? Is there some reason to believe that the initial clustering has some correlation with the target clustering? If so, what is the correlation, and how does this impact the number of queries? If not, what does FPC help? what if the target clustering is an arbitrary partition of the dataset and has nothing to do with geometric clustering ideas that place closer points in the same cluster? If the target clustering is an arbitrary partition of the dataset, what are the number of queries required to cluster?\n\nWith a lack of discussion on various issues and a lack of clarity on the suggested algorithm, it is difficult to form an informed opinion about the paper.
