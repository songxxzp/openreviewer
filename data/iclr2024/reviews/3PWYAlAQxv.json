Random weights usually suggest we cannot control what the weights can be, but if we can make pairs of weights identical, why not just use the fixed initialization scheme instead? In general the proposed proof method seems to be too specific to adapt to other situations - in the case of truly random weights, error in the constant regions of the stepwise approximators could accumulate globally (see questions for a different suggestion).
