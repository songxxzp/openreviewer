TACTIS-2 builds upon TACTIS which uses neural networks to parameterize copulas for multivariate time series forecasting. To ensure the validity of learned copulas, TACTIS trains the model with random permutations of the variables which leads to problems with high-dimensional time series. To address this limitation, TACTIS-2 uses two stage training. In the first stage, marginal distributions are learned without any dependency between them. Later, the copula parameters are learned given the optimal marginal parameters. Forecasting and interpolation results on 5 datasets from Monash time series repository show that TACTIS-2 improves over TACTIS in terms of the prediction performance and training time."

However, the experiments have only been conducted on 5 datasets from the Monash repository. The baseline selection also needs improvement for the _state of the art_ claim.
