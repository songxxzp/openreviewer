It could be argued that this is an artificial problem, in that the typical purpose of mass detection systems is to assist with the recall decision for screening mammograms either as an automated second reader or prompting system. Segmenting the masses itself is of less importance in clinical settings. No real attempt is made to outline why mass segmentation is of use.\n\nAs this paper focusses on the introduction of a novel segmentation loss, it would be helpful to see it evaluated on a range of datasets in other imaging domains to see if it has more broad utility. \n\nImages are resized to 256x256 meaning that the algorithm processes very low resolution images. Does this have any effect detection/segmentation of small lesions?\n\nObject segmentation approaches (i.e. Mask RCNN) are not considered in the background literature or evaluation. \n\nMinor comments:\n\nFigure 1 is hard to understand and doesn\u2019t really do much to explain the limitations of BCE. \n\nFigure 2 is also challenging to understand. \n\nFigure 3 caption labels appear to be the wrong way round. \n\nFigure 4 caption doesn\u2019t which is ground truth and which is predicted.\n\nNo discussion of object detection approaches are taken (i.e. RCNN type). \n\nSuggestions:\n\nAdd the colour codes to the figure captions so they can be understood independently."

                "value": "1. The paper\u2019s main algorithm lacks explanation. In Section 2.3.2, the scale-based loss is to rescale the L_G with the scale ratio. However, how the definition of scale ratio can help overcome the size differences and the differences in the quantities of the masses is not explained at all. Thus, the paper\u2019s argument to incorporate the size information is not supported.\n\n2. The paper's contribution appears to be insufficient. The two methods proposed for aggregating cell losses seem straightforward. Moreover, the computation of the scale ratio in Section 2.3.2, which is based on the ratio of the number of cells, seems to achieve the same objective as simply computing the ratio of the number of pixels.\n\n3. The paper contains some writing mistakes. Notably, the methodology section is incorrectly placed under \"Related Work.\" Additionally, Eq. 5 and Eq. 8 are flawed, with Eq. 5 missing the indicator function in the numerator and Eq. 8 lacking summation in both the numerator and denominator. Furthermore, Fig. 1(b)'s caption mentions size and location differences, but the figure only depicts location differences. Lastly, Fig. 3(a) and (b) should be swapped.\n\n4. The experiments conducted in the paper solely focus on one dataset, thereby inadequately supporting the claims made. Table 1 indicates that combining the scale loss and distance loss could lead to worse results compared to using either of them individually. In fact, with Tversky loss, the optimal outcome is achieved when the authors utilize the basic loss, which does not incorporate scale or distance."

This would lead to high penalty when the prediction has much more positive regions than the ground truth, but lead to low penalty when the prediction has much less positive region than the ground truth.
