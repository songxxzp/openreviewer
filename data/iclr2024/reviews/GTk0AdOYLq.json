In the conditional setting, is the linguistic representation ${y}^l$ aware of the whole sentence text information or just aware of the text information of the corresponding frame? Is there a length regulator to align the text representation to the sample points? \n2. What is the practical scenario of synthesizing extremely long sentences (>512 words)? Such long sentences are rare in natural language. Compared with FastSpeech2 and WaveGrad2, the proposed method consumes even more GPU memory in normal-length sentences, which is below 512 or 32 words. There are obvious baseline methods to generate long sentences, such as splitting sentences or linguistic representation into chunks, synthesizing them separately, then concatenating the waveform. Under this setting, both of FastSpeech2 and WaveGrad2 can generate unlimited waveform durations while preserving the computational resources, and with even lower computation. Could the proposed method outperform these baselines by scaling down the computation cost to match these models? \n3. Although there is a justification of the choice of a long frame length in the unconditional setting, the author did not explain why they also used such a long frame in the conditional setting. There is also no ablation study on this. Note that these two settings are different in aspect of the global information. The global information provided by the long frame length in the unconditional setting can be provided by linguistic representation ${y}^l$ in the conditional setting. If the frame length can be shortened without performance drop in the conditional setting, the GPU memory could be reduced further, but the proposed method would be like a vocoder rather than a TTS system."

Weak baselines and limited reference: The author should acknowledge and compare their proposed model against other works in a relevant research direction (i.e., diffusion-based TTS), e.g., FastDiff, Diff-TTS, Grad-TTS, PriorGrad, ProDiff, etc. It is understandable that comparing with all the conventional methods is computationally prohibitive, yet the authors should at least discuss the pros and cons of these methods in comparison to DiffAR. The latest diffusion-based TTS model that the authors referred to was WaveGrad 2 (released in 2021), which is not up-to-date and not the SOTA in this research direction. I am skeptical whether this baseline is strong enough, and I suggest the authors to use a more recent TTS model as for a stronger baseline.\n\n2. Implicit description on synthesis time: In section 5.4, while the section is titled \"COMPUTATIONAL LIMITATIONS AND SYNTHESIS TIME\", I expect to see exact numbers or a graph reporting the inference speed of DiffAR. However, the authors only show the memory usage of DiffAR and implicitly describe the limitation of DiffAR in synthesis time, which makes it unclear how much we need to sacrifice in efficiency to exchange for an improved quality. It would be unfair if we focus on quality and compare DiffAR with FastSpeech 2, since FS2 is clearly much more efficient in time. And, conceivably, as an autoregressive model similar to WaveNet, DiffAR should be quite sensitive to the length of the waveform to be generated."

The diffusion model itself only captures dependencies between overlapping frames and not between distant frames except through conditioning variables (e.g., speech synthesis parameter trajectories) that might stretch across longer timescales. The audio instantiations are assumed to be conditionally independent given this information. In the experiments, these frames are 500ms long and overlap by 250ms with each other. \n\nThe system is evaluated on TTS for the LJ Speech single-talker corpus. It uses separate models for predicting duration, energy, and pitch, and pronunciation of a given transcript, then this diffusion model as vocoder to synthesize it. Listening tests with 45 raters rate the proposed method as 3.9 percentage points higher than WaveGrad 2 and 2.0 percentage points higher than FastSpeech 2 improved in a MUSHRA task. Putting the synthesized speech through a Whisper ASR yields lower CER and WER on the proposed method than WaveGrad2, while the same comparison shows slightly lower CER and WER for FastSpeech 2 improved than the proposed approach."

Given this change in assumptions, it is not clear to me what the difference is between this approach and other diffusion-based vocoders. This difference should be emphasized and elaborated in the paper.\n\nThe comparison with other methods does not seem able to distinguish between differences in the TTS front end and back end between the methods. The different methods differ in both, so it is not clear if differences in performance can be attributes to the proposed method, which is really only concerned with the backend vocoder and not the system for generating the conditioning information. It is also not clear why the particular TTS front end was selected, as it seems less sophisticated than tacotron2, for example, which has been around for several years."

Due to the similarity in methodology, it is important to differentiate DiffAR where the only justification provided is the potentially better representation compared to using MelSpectrograms (which contain only amplitude information). However, capturing vocal fry without more comprehensive experiments (the work only compares against 2 model classes - FastSpeech2 + HiFi GAN and Wavegrad 2) is not enough to establish superiority of the proposed technique over variants which use acoustic features.\n\n\nMoreover, an entire class of models which have established SOTA are not mentioned (VITS -> YourTTS -> VALL-E -> Voicebox (recent, past the ICLR cutoff)). All of these models outperform baselines mentioned in the current paper, and therefore the paper fails to establish its position and tradeoffs with respect to recent literature.\n\nThe overall theme is that due to either omission or lack of comparison (quantiative/qualitative), the paper feels like an alternative methodology that isn't convincing enough in its evaluation about outperforming/matching SOTA (which it does claim to do so). This is especially critical because of the key choice of choosing an *AR model* which are substantially slower than their non auto-regressive counterparts. Consequently for one to inherit the caveat of slow inference (RTF not measured in the paper), the model must have high quality and/or other advantages in order to justify the tradeoff.\n\n### Major\n- Single speaker dataset, with limited samples vs larger, multi speaker datasets (LibriTTS (Kahnetal et al, 2020), LibriSpeech, VCTK(Veauxetal et al,2016), LibriTTS(Zenetal et al, 2019))\n- Quantitative/qualitative comparisons are provided against models (Fastspeech2 + HiFi GAN, Wavegrad 2) which are no longer SOTA (even as of Jan 2023) - missing important relevant references such as VITS, YourTTS, VALL-E. \n> I acknowledge the difficulty of obtaining implmentations which is alluded to in the footnote mentioning that implementations of fastspeech 2s (Ren et al., 2020), Wave-Tacotron (Weiss et al., 2021) could not be obtained.\n- Authors claim \"Although there is a plethora of TTS systems available, our objective was to benchmark against the most high-performing and relevant models WaveGrad 2 and FastSpeech 2.\" without defining clearly how relevance is established since one can argue based on alternative methodologies and/or performance DiffTTS, GradTTS, DiffGAN-TTS, VITS, YourTTS are also extremely viable candidates. Even a qualitative, written explanation of the critical tradeoffs between the current work and the aforementioned models would help one understand the contribution of the work significantly better.\n\n### Minor\n- No benchmarks on synthesis speed (Real time factor), but based on the chosen schemes (DDPM + AR) it seems evident that the model will be quite slow\n- No discussion on extending the current model to multi speaker and other prosodies (it is mentioned in the conclusion as future work)\n\nI vote to reject the paper due to the aforementioned reasons, but I am willing to be corrected and change my score accordingly in case I misunderstood any aspect of the work and/or the literature."
