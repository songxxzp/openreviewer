                "value": "This paper focuses on the problem of sequential decision making with signal delay. \n\nThat means observations on the current state do not arrive immediately after an action is taken, but arrive several steps after. \n\nThis delay in signal effectively makes the problem a POMDP, even when the agent always observes the underlying environment state.  \n\nTthe authors propose the formalization for such setting, called delayed osbervation MDP, and show that in fact it is a special case of POMDP. \n\nWhile we can potentially see this kind of problem as a POMDP and use standard DRL algorithms for POMDPs, the authors argue and show that these algorithms struggle in such setting. \n\nAs the main contribution of this paper, several techniques are proposed to improve the performance of DRL algorithms, in particular, actor critic methods, in this setting. \n\nThese techniques mainly rely on using priviledged information, e.g., access to the true current state, during offline training to improve the learning of actor and critic. \n\nSpecifically, for the critic, the authors propose to condition the critic on the true current state instead of the history of observations or the current observation which might be the true state a few steps earlier during training. Because the critic is not used during inference or deployment, this approach is possible as long as we have access to the true states during training. \nFor the actor, the authors propose to add actions taken in the past to the inputs of the actor as this will provide useful information to help the actor to predict the true current state. \n\nExperiments are performed to test the effectiveness of these proposed techniques. To do so, the authors take SAC, a strong model-free baseline, and build upon it with the proposed techniques. Results show that these techniques are indeed generally useful, especially when the delay is longer."

                "value": "My biggest concern on this paper is that many of the proposed techniques, if not all, are not new, and the paper misses a large body of closely relevant works. In Section 4.1, the authors propose to condition the critic on the true current state (without delay) to improve learning. The idea of using priviledged information during training by conditioning the critic on the ground-truth state in actor critic methods has been widely explored by both the POMDP and MARL communities. For example, see [1] and [2] for the former case and [3] for the latter case. Section 4.1 basically describes a trivial application of this idea to DOMDPs, which are special cases of POMDPs. Furthermore, the authors mention that the efficay of such asymmetric architecture has been demonstrated by past previous studies. However, in [2], it has been shown that conditioning the critic (only) on the true state is fundamentally questionable as it leads to biased gradients. \n\nThen in Section 4.2, the authors propose to give the actor past actions to help it infer the state at the current step. I don't understand why is this not done by default. In my understanding, DOMDPs are POMDPs and in POMDPs, past actions and observations should always be given to the policy for optimal control. I don't see how this is an innovation. \n\nThe method that is proposed in Section 4.3 has also been explored for the general POMDP settings. For example, in [4,5,6], people have explored auxiliary losses (to predict the next observation, state, reward) for improving the representation learning of RNNs when learning optimal policies in POMDPs. \n\nIn the beginning of Section 3, baseline DRL methods are tested in delay signal settings and they are demonstrated to struggle in such a setting. Reasons are guessed for why they fail. However, I do not think that the failure of these baselines methods are studied well enough. I would like to see more ablation study on understanding how exactly they fail, which I believe will greatly help readers understand in what way DOMDPs are different to POMDPs and what are their unique challenges. Is it really due to the signal delay? Or like in general POMDPs, the RNNs cannot come up with good representations for decision making? For example, if these methods struggle to learn representations that support effective decision making, then one can test the accuracy of using these learned representations to predict the true current state. There are possible causes mentioned in paper but I find them rather vague and are not enough to motivate the proposed algorithmic changes. \n\nI also find lots of experimental details are missing from the paper, such as the architectures of networks, and the hyperparameters. Also, for the baselines, such as DDPG, TD3, SAC, are they also RNN based? It would be strange to use a non-recurrent baseline in a POMDP environment. And are the past actions passed to the actors in these baseline methods? Regarding hyperparameters, it would also be useful to know how are the hyperparameters tuned for each baseline and the proposed method to ensure fair comparison. \n\n[1] Baisero, Andrea, Brett Daley, and Christopher Amato. \"Asymmetric DQN for partially observable reinforcement learning.\" Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence.

                "value": "In Figure 3, I find it weird to argue that baseline methods are failing by saying that there is a significant drop in performance from no delay to one-step delay. With different delay steps, we essentially have different POMDPs, which may inherently have different difficulty levels and different optimal performance. As such, the drop in performance I think is not sufficient to say the baseline methods are failing. However, a comparison to the optimal performance or performance from a better method would work. \n\nminor:\n- in Figure 3, colors correspond to delay lengths different in (d) than in other subplots. this can be confusing for readers."
