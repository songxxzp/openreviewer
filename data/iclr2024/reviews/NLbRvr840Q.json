The introduced hypergraph dynamic systems framework in this paper bridges hypergraph learning and dynamic systems, which can take the advantages of hypergraph on high-order correlation modeling and dynamic systems on controllable diffusion process. The idea of hypergraph dynamic systems is novel. It is a good attempt towards better representation learning and could be helpful to a broad field.\n\nThe authors also propose an implementation of HDS using ODE, and a multi-layer HDS-ode is given. The stability analysis has also been detailed analyzed. The difference between HDS-ode and traditional HGNNs has discussed.\n\nExperiments are sufficient. Experiments on semi-supervised vertex classification with two different settings have been conducted on 7 datasets. Experimental results have clearly shown the superior performance of HDS-ode compared with recent state-of-the-art GNN/HGNN methods. From the results, we can observe the control-diffusion process of HDS-ode is stable, which solves the limitations of existing HGNNs, i.e. only 1 or 2 layers can be used.\n\nIn general, this paper is well organized and writing. The related works are sufficient and the motivation is clear. The method has been detailed introduced. This paper brings in a new aspect of representation learning of taking both high-order correlation modeling and dynamic systems into consideration simultaneously, which has the potential to have broad impact."

To the terminology (and the preliminary math tools) of dynamical systems used in this paper, it seems that the authors does not soundly cook its article based on the strict math that has been widely accepted in math and engineering. See Queation 1, Weakness point 2 and 3.\n\n2. The discussion of statibility seems wrong. That's why we say the authors may not well pick up knowledge of (linear/nonlinear) dynamical systems. Sec. 5.1 discussed the stability of HDS-ODE, where the statement of the first sentence in this section is basically wrong. The so-called \"control\" term also iterate over time. It cannot be simplified the stability analysis of HDS-ODE as simply a dissusion of linear system X_dot = A X. Let us use the eq.(3) to clarify the point simply. Supposing we accept the split of the general state-space equation X_dot = f(X, t) as eq.(3), it is obviously that the stability analysis is a general stability analysis of nonlinear system, besides AX(t) there also exists g(X(t))! If you said your discussion of HDS-ODE refer to the neural implementation, we can see that in eq. (6) the nonlinear term is still there, except it is in NN form, and then embeds into eq.(7) to complete the iteration t+1. Furthermore, these propositions on stability for your \"simplified\" linear systems are well-known in the field of electrical engineering.\n\n3. Your abstract and contribution summary tell that yours studies the \"controllability\", which we could find anything related to it. And regarding the starting point of the most general eq.(2), there cannot be any controllablity-related problem can be formulated. Maybe you refer to something different? We strongly recommend the authors to learn essentials of dynamical systems, it helps to avoid conceptual misunderstandings and misuse for better communications.\n\n   To help you with essential knowledge on dynamical systems, you may refer to the following classic textbooks (basics on linear, nonlinear systems):\n\n   - Zhou, K., Doyle, J. C., & Glover, K. (1995). Robust and Optimal Control. Pearson.\n   - H. K. Khalil, \u201cNonlinear Systems,\u201d 3rd Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, 2002.\n\nYour idea may be valuable and appreciated, considering your sound performance in experiments.

We are not familiar with the terminology in the \"small\" field (that is consisted of these ~5 papers in introduction). However, in the mature fields of \"dynamical systems\" in math, \"stochastic analysis\" in probability or mathematical finance  and \"control theory/engineering\" or \"cybernetics\" in engineering, neither the name of \"control\" nor \"diffusion\" may be  properly defined. The control term usually refers to external signals or extrogeneous variables (in econometrics) that can be designed or modified. Indeed, if you assume, eq.(3) is not an autonomous system in nature (if purely looking at (3) itself, it is), but the feedback system by using the nonlinear state feedback law g(X) as the control \"u\" for the linear dynamical system X_dot = A X + u. It somehow legitimate the name \"control\". However, it is still not recommended in this way since it is confusing. Referring to the diffusion term, we cannot see why it can be call as this name, since the diffusion term is h(X)dW in the SDE dX(t) = f(X, t) dt + h(X,t) dW, where W is the Brownian motion. The AX(t) term in eq.(3) is actually the term of f(X,t), so the drift term. \n2. See Weakness point 2 on Sec.5.1.
