In essence, there exist permutations of the weights which *do* change the function, but are considered equivalent by SNE. Consider the flattened weights [1 2 3 4 5 6] with a chunk size of 3. The weights [4 5 6 1 2 3] would be considered exactly the same, since the set of chunks {[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]} are the same. As such, the proposed SNE is not capturing the correct equivariance of the task: it is unable to distinguish between models that are clearly different. This is the primary reason why I'm giving a 1 in terms of soundness. Given the lack of discussion and evaluation of this issue in the paper, I cannot recommend acceptance at this point.\n- The authors do not consider the case of architectures with branches and how the position encoding needs to be adapted for them\n- There is a lack of comparison against existing methods on established datasets. For example, there are no experiments on implicit neural representations, which DWSNet [2] and NFN [Zhou et al., 2013] are evaluated on extensively. There is no reference to DWSNet in the text.\n\n[1] Neural Functional Transformers. Allan Zhou, Kaien Yang, Yiding Jiang, Kaylee Burns, Winnie Xu, Samuel Sokota, J.

As mentioned in Section 3.6, $\\Phi_{\\theta_{1}}$ is SAB(SAB(X)), while SAB(X) is MAB(X,X) in Equation 10. It seems that MAB(X,X) should have the same size as X. How can we get from  $c\\times1$ to $c\\times h$? You may want to add the dimensions for Equations 10 to 13 for clarification.\n- To my understanding, the encoding process from Section 3.3 to 3.5 is like a nested process. Is it possible to provide a pseudocode for it?\n- It seems that the \"specific dataset $d$\" in Section 3.1 is never used. You may want to get rid of it.\n- About the experiments, could you have some results on popular CNN architectures like ResNet? Residual links are nowadays important part of the CNN models."
