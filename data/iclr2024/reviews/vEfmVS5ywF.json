                "value": "* The paper introduces a reverse-causal strategic classification setting, and analyzes it primarily within the context of the Coate-Loury labor market model.\n* In the Coate-Loury labor market model, an employer trains a screening function $f(x)$ to detect high-skill workers ($y=1$), and workers respond strategically by possibly increasing their skill level at cost $c$. Worker features $x\\\\in[0,1]$ are a noisy function of skill ($x\\\\sim\\\\Phi(\\\\cdot | y)$), making the strategic response reverse-causal.\n* The analysis investigates the gap between the associated repeated risk minimization (RRM/\u201dstable\u201d) and performatively optimal (PO/\u201dperformative\u201d) policies (eq. (2.2) and eq. (2.3), respectively).\n* For a Coate-Loury model with a uniform decision rule (same decision threshold $\\\\theta$ for all population), Theorem 3.1 gives conditions under which a PO policy results in a higher proportion of skilled workers and increased employer\u2019s utility compared to RRM.\n* For a model with non-uniform decision policies (two groups {Maj,Min} and a separate decision threshold for each), Theorem 3.2 gives conditions under which RRM leads to a discriminatory population composition, and PO leads to population composition which is approximately balanced.\n* Finally, a generalization of the Coate-Loury model with inter-group interactions is investigated by numerical simulation. Results indicate that a PO policy leads to higher employer utility, but can generally reduce the welfare of the workers."

(3.1)), and convergence is claimed to be due to \u201crepeated risk minimization, which is known to converge to performatively stable policies (Perdomo et al., 2020)\u201d. However, if I understand correctly, the convergence guarantees in Perdomo et al. 2020 rely on strong regularity assumptions (e.g., $\\\\beta$-joint smoothness, $\\\\gamma$-strong convexity, $\\\\varepsilon$-sensitivity) and RRM can fail to converge in their absence (see Theorem 3.5 and Proposition 3.6 in Perdomo et al. 2020). I was unable to find a discussion of these assumptions and their applicability in the paper, and therefore it is not clear why RRM is guaranteed to converge in this context.\n* The learning setting is unclear (see questions below).\n* Code is not provided, making it hard to validate and reproduce the results of Section 4, which rely on numerical evaluation.\n* Interaction model assumes one dimensional features and strict monotone likelihood ratio. It is not clear how results extend to higher-dimensional features and more complex distribution structures."

This complements prior results (for example, in Perdomo et al. (2020)) that provide conditions under which the gap is small.\u201d. In contrast, Theorem 4.3 in Perdomo et al. 2020 predicts that the gap between the PO and RRM policies is expected to be small. What is the relation between the gaps presented in this paper and Theorem 4.3 in Perdomo et al.? If some required Theorem 4.3 are not met, which ones? And how does it relate to the RRM convergence guarantees discussed in the question above?\n* Learning setting: At what stage data is available to the employer, and how do they learn from it? How do the main results extend to scenarios where predictors are learned from finite datasets?\n* Do similar results hold for the content creation scenario described in Example 2.2? What would be required in order to apply the results in other scenarios?\n* Small question about notations: What is the difference between $w\\\\int_X 1_{\\\\{f(x)=1\\\\}} d\\\\Phi(x|Y=1)$ and $\\\\int_{[0,1]} w f(x) d \\\\Phi(x|1)$ in Example 2.1?\n* Small typo in Section 2: examplse.

                "value": "This paper proposes a novel formulation of the causal strategic classification problem. Here, there is a set of agents, each described by x, the values for a set of features and with a true label y. A classifier wishes to classify agents based on their features x to minimize some loss function defined w.r.t. the true labels y of the agents. \n\nHowever, the agents are strategic, and given a classifier with parameters \\theta, can change their label y by changing their features at a certain cost, in order to obtain a utility from the classification. The problem is motivated through the running example of the labor market, where the employer has a hiring policy based on the skill of the worker. Workers can change their skill in order to increase their chances of being hired and obtain the wage from being hired. \n\nThe model assumes that there is a (reverse) causal model that determines the relationship between the features and the label (or vice-versa respectively). The paper focuses on the setting with a reverse causal model. Here, agents are allowed only to determine whether they want a change in their label, and the reverse causal model determines how the features must be changed. \n\nThe technical results of the paper deal with analyzing the solutions of the game that results from the interactions between the classifier and agents under such a reverse causal model, with interesting results and consequences for a well-studied model of the labor market. The paper provides interesting results on the effect of a reactive classifier (which iteratively updates the parameters \\theta after the agents respond to the classifier used in the previous iteration) and a strategic classifier which anticipates the best response of the agents on the welfare of the classifier and agents."
