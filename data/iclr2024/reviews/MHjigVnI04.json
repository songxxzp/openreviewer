Moreover, they also show that this alignment between the SGD iterates and the top eigenspace of the Hessian holds layer-wise and does not depend on the model's success.\n\n[1] Gur-Ari, G., Roberts, D.A., & Dyer, E.

In many theoretical setups, the relevant subspaces can be guessed from symmetries of the problem, and can be used to derive low-dimensional scaling limits for the projection of the trajectory in these subspaces - an approach that has been employed in many works old and recent works in the literature, c.f. [Saad & Solla 1995a,b; Goldt et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2019; Refinetti et al. 2021; Veiga et al 2022; Ben Arous et al. 2022; Paquette et al. 2022; Arnaboldi et al 2023; Shuo & Vershynin 2023]. However, an important limitation of this approach is that it is hard to generalise to more general setups where the relevant statistics are less clear to guess. This work proposes a roadmap to overcome this limitation, consisting of taking the spam of the top outlier directions in the Hessian/G-matrix, and shows this correlates with the standard summary statistics for these examples. If this proves more general, it could open up an important new theoretical tool in the study of SGD."

                "value": "The main limitation is that the two classification tasks have a particular structure. Indeed, in both the linear case and the two-layer case considered here, the Hessian/G-matrix of the first layer weights is proportional to $Y\\otimes Y$. For a Gaussian mixture $Y = y\\mu + Z_{\\lambda}$, indeed the relevant subspace spanned by the means will naturally pop as an outlier of this matrix when the SNR $\\lambda$ is large enough: this is the classical BBP transition. Therefore, it is not surprising this also happens at the level of the Hessian/G-matrix. Maybe proving this requires a tour de force, but it is fair to doubt on the generality of the conclusion. For instance, it would be desirable to show a similar result for tasks where the structure is on the labels, and not on the inputs, e.g. teacher-student models."

How general should we expect this to be? For instance, would be authors expect this to hold in problems where escaping a fixed point would take longer than linear time in the dimension?\n\n- **[Q3]**: On the same spirit of the question above, would the authors expect the theorem to remain true at longer timescales? In general, should we expect these subspaces to be stable or the SGD trajectories to eventually escape these subspaces?\n\n- **[Q4]**: From the statement of the results, it seems they hold for both the G-matrix and the Hessian. Is there any reason for looking at the Hessian instead of the computationally simpler G-matrix? Are the subspaces spanned by the top eigenvectors of both matrices equivalent, e.g. in the sense of Def. 2.2?\n\n- **[Q5]**: Are the authors aware of converse examples to their result. For instance, a problem where the underlying target function does depend only on a few relevant directions, but that the outliers in the Hessian/G-matrix are not necessarily aligned with it?  \n\n**Minor comments**\n\n- The reference in the top of Page 2:\n> \"*Liao & Mahoney (2021) studied Hessians of some non-linear models beyond generalized linear models, also at initialization.*\"\n\nis misleading. The main result in Liao & Mahoney (2021) concerns the Hessian of a loss function of the type (see eq. 3):\n$$L(w)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\ell(y_{i}, w^{\\top}x_{i})$$ under the assumption $y_{i}\\sim f(y|w_{\\star}^{\\top}x_{i})$ (see eq. 1). Despite their unusual choice of terminology for this model (\"G-GLM\"), this is mostly commonly known as a generalized linear model in the literature... when just not simply refereed to as \"linear model\".\n\n- The following references:\n> *ODE limits of the SGD training with single layer networks have been derived and numerically solved in Mignacco et al. (2020); Loureiro et al. (2021).*\n\nare not accurate. Indeed, Mignacco et al. (2020) and Loureiro et al. (2021) study the classification of Gaussian mixtures with a single layer networks. However, they derive exact expressions for the training and test errors of the minimiser of the empirical risk. Indeed, this should correspond to the asymptotic performance of one-pass SGD when $t\\to\\infty$ of the example considered in Section 3.\n\n- The figures in the manuscript are not very readable. First, even if this is described in the caption, it would be good to label the (x,y)-axis for clarity. Second, they are small, and since the format is not vectorial they get pixelated when zoomed over. Third, what does the colour scheme means? Maybe add a colour bar?\n\n- I understand the authors might not want to dwell 30 years of literature on SGD scaling limits. But I would encourage them to mention at least some of the recents works on this line which are contemporary to [Ben Arous et al. 2022] to represent the diversity of this literature, see e.g. the list below.\n\n**Typos**:\n\n- Page 7: \"*direcitons*\" -> \"*directions*\"\n\n**References**\n- **[Goldt et al. 2019]** Sebastian Goldt, Madhu Advani, Andrew M.

It is shown that after a short period of training, the SGD iterates start to align with the low-rank outlier eigenspace with the empirical Hessian and empirical G-matrices, and that the alignment may happen layer-wise for multi-layer architectures. The main results are proved for two settings: 1) learning a Gaussian mixture model with linearly independent classes by a single layer neural network, and 2) learning a Gaussian mixture model version of the XOR problem. Numerical evidence is also provided to illustrate the theoretical results."

According to the introduction and the related works, from my perspective, the best thing we know about the relationship between the Hessian and the effectiveness of SGD is that \"this common low-dimensional structure to the SGD and Hessian matrix may be key to many classification tasks in machine learning\" (Gur-Ari et al., 2019). From my point of view, there is no solid evidence indicating that the main results of this work imply an advantage or a disadvantage of SGD. I will consider raising my score if this question is properly settled.\n2. Figure 3.3  and Figure 4.3 are a bit confusing without legends.\n3. In the paragraph following Theorem 4.2, the terms \"GOE\" and \"Wishart matrix\" may appear unfamiliar to many.\n4. In the notation of covariance matrix $I_d/\\lambda$, the $\\lambda$, which is typically a weight decay parameter, is used as the inverse of variance, causing some confusions to me."
