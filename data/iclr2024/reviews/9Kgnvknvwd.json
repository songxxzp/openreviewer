Consequently, the technical innovation compared to prior work upon which this study is based is limited.\n\n2. The convergence result of the proposed method lacks persuasiveness. As pointed out by the authors, the constraint $q(z) \\le 0$ in the reformulated problem (3) is ill-posed, rendering the KKT stationary condition not a necessary condition for problem (3) solutions. Therefore, the utilization of the $\\mathcal{K}(z)$ measure for the convergence of the proposed method in the main convergence theorem (Theorem 4.3) is inappropriate. In contrast, the MoCo method by Fernando et al. (2023) employs hyper-gradients under the same strong convexity in the LL problem to characterize convergence and establish convergence to Pareto stationarity.\n\n3. The analysis of the proposed algorithm is confined to a deterministic setting, which may restrict its applicability given that the motivating applications are mostly in the stochastic setting.\n\n4. The strong convexity of the LL problem appears to play a pivotal role in the convergence analysis, which, in turn, constrains the applicability of the proposed method. Notably, the MOML method introduced by Ye et al. (2022) does not necessitate such an assumption."

First, to deal with the reformulated constraint in the value-function based method, the authors use a dot product between $d$ and the gradient of the constraint and make it less or equal to $-\\phi_k$. However, how to pick this $\\phi_k$ in practice and in theory? Also, the final convergence criterion seems questionable. For example, the authors use the measure of KKT stationary condition to as convergence criterion. How does this condition correlate with Parato stationarity? How fast does the parameter $v_k$ decrease to 0 in this criterion? All these questions are not well explained in this work. \n2.\tThe algorithm has some unclear parts. For example, the authors use the idea of momentum update on $\\lambda$ update. This step is originally proposed in Zhou et al., 2022 (the authors should mention about this). However, there is characterization on the distance between the true variable $\\lambda_k$ and the surrogate $\\titilde \\lambda_k$? This is important, because what you need to use is $\\lambda_k$ rather than surrogate $\\titilde \\lambda_k$ in the algorithm. \n3.\tThe algorithm is deterministic without data sampling, but in the experiments it seems data sampling is used. I am wondering if it is possible to extend the algorithm and analysis to the more practice stochastic setting? If not, what are the challenges?
