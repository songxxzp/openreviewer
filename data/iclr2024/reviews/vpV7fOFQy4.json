If these conjectures are dived deeper with further evidence and justification, it will make the paper more solid.\n\nAnother major critique is that the algorithms CQL and BC are no longer the SOTA results for these offline RL baselines, and more effective algorithms are proposed with improvement. Examples like TD3BC [1], percentage BC, Diffusion Q-learning [2] for BC type methods,  and implicit Q-learning, implicit diffusion Q-learning [3], for Q-learning type methods, etc. Comparing DT with CQL, BC is a good starting point, but it could also be more interesting to see those more advanced algorithms in these comparisons. For example, it is known that BC does not perform well as long as the dataset contains not only high-return samples, but how does percentage BC perform in settings other than Sec. 4.2?

And two trajectories may end at the same state but have significantly different total rewards, causing disagreement. I can see why this transformation would break CQL but not DT, and indeed CQL deterioriates much more on sparse D4RL than sparse Robomimic. So I think the results here do not convincingly show that CQL is worse than DT for sparse environments in general; on D4RL, this artificial transformation violates an assumption underlying the CQL algorithm, and on Robomimic, CQL was already worse than DT on Robomimic even when given dense rewards.\n* The experiment on stochasticity does not seem to perfectly answer the question \u201chow good are these algorithms in stochastic environments?\u201d because the data you are training on was collected with deterministic dynamics. So really what you are testing is \u201chow well does a policy trained by these algorithms in a deterministic MDP transfer to a similar stochastic MDP?\u201d. This may also be an interesting question to study, but I think that if you intend to answer the first question, the experiment is not entirely appropriate, and it would be best to repeat it with the training data also collected in a stochastic MDP.\n* Some of the conclusions regarding BC are obvious (e.g. BC suffers more than offline RL when there is suboptimal/noisy data) or already widely known (e.g. BC works better than offline RL on human-generated demonstrations). It could provide more insight to include a hybrid method such as TD3-BC and show how the degree of regularization affects the behavior."

It investigates their performance across benchmark datasets like D4RL and ROBOMIMIC, analyzing their behavior under varying data quality, task complexity, and stochasticity.\n\nThe key findings reveal that DT requires more data than CQL to achieve competitive performance, but exhibits higher robustness to suboptimal data. Notably, DT outperforms both CQL and BC in sparse reward and low-quality data settings. Interestingly, DT and BC demonstrate superior performance for tasks with longer horizons or data collected from human demonstrations. Additionally, CQL shines in situations characterized by both high stochasticity and lower data quality.\n\nBeyond comparative analysis, the paper delves deeper into DT, exploring optimal architectural choices and scaling trends on ATARI and D4RL datasets. Notably, it demonstrates that increasing the data volume by fivefold results in a 2.5x average score improvement for DT on ATARI.\n\nOverall, this research offers valuable insights for selecting the most appropriate offline RL algorithm based on the specific characteristics of the task and data conditions."
