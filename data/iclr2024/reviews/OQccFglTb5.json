                "value": "The authors introduce FT-Shield in this study, a sophisticated watermarking approach engineered to secure copyright adherence in text-to-image diffusion models against unauthorized fine-tuning. FT-Shield achieves this by inserting a watermark into images, which persists when adversaries employ these watermarked images for fine-tuning text-to-image models. The robustness of FT-Shield is validated across diverse fine-tuning scenarios, confirming its deterrent capability against unauthorized exploitation and its reinforcement of legal copyrights. This investigation signifies a notable progression in the protection of intellectual property within the field of generative modeling, contributing to responsible AI development."

In the current appendix, there is a limited variety of cases presented; for instance, Figure 3 showcases a singular style. Enriching this section with a broader array of cases, including those involving objects and more styles, would be advantageous.\n\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. To encapsulate a wider spectrum of applications, I would suggest incorporating tests on human images as well. Protecting human figures is important, and as such, it would be valuable to see examples, such as those involving public figures (e.g., Nicolas Cage)."

For instance, if style A is watermarked and then utilized by an adversary, there's a query whether a generated image with an unwatermarked style B could yield a false positive detection. Clarification on this possible form of FPR would be valuable.\n\n2. Could the authors explore the feasibility of generating multiple watermarks within their framework? Given that practical applications often necessitate protecting a variety of styles or objects, understanding how the proposed system manages multiple watermark integrations is critical. Challenges such as the potential overwriting of previously learned watermarks or an increase in false positive rates (FPR) are of particular concern and merit discussion.\n\n\nQuestions for experiments\n1. It is suggested that Table 3 includes FID scores to substantiate the authors' claim regarding adversaries potentially halting the fine-tuning process once personalization is achieved. Providing FID scores and corresponding visual results for each condition tested would offer a more complete analysis of the model's performance.\n\n2. Could the authors specify what is meant by \"one fine-tuning\" as used in the context of Section 4.4 for assessing transferability? A more detailed explanation would help clarify the experimental procedures.\n\n3. In Section 4.5, could you quantify the intensity of the disturbances applied and discuss how varying levels of disturbance strength influence the True Positive Rate (TPR)?\n\n4.  in Section 4.5, would it be possible for the authors to present results where all disturbances are combined, to evaluate the cumulative effect on the watermark detection system?"

In order to handle this issue, watermarking methods are proposed to identify whether a generated image is produced by a model fine-tuned with unauthorized data. Unluckily, when using existing watermarking methods, the style or object information is learned by the fine-tuned diffusion model earlier than the watermark. As a result, offenders can evade watermarks by reducing fine-tuning steps. In order to mitigate this issue, this paper proposes FT-Shield. In particular, FT-Shield optimizes the watermark such that it can be easily learned. Extensive experiments validate the performance of the proposed FT-Sheild. The idea of optimizing watermarks such that the watermarks are easier to learn is novel and interesting.\nThe proposed FT-Shield is verified to be effective for various fine-tuning methods, e.g., lora, dreambooth."
