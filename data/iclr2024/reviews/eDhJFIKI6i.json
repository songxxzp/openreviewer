                "value": "- Sec 2.1: \"existing GTs inject graph priors ... through ... positional encodings, based on which attention scores ... elements located next to each other will have higher attention to each other\" --> my understanding is that PEs allow distinguishing token position, but is there strong evidence that they induce higher similarity between adjacent positions?  \n\n- Challenge 2 is somewhat vague / ambiguous.  It covers two topics of heavy long-tailed degree distributions, as well as a class distribution (maybe relevant to tasks where nodes have associated classes, which is somewhat independent of model architecture).  Better separation of the discussion of these two topics and how they relate to GTs would be clearer. \n\n- Is there supposed to be an observation from Challenge 3 (like there is from 1 and 2?)\n\n- Evidences of the reality/presence of the challenges discussed in Section 2 would strongly help motivate this work.  Design elements being structured around philosophical challenges without demonstration of those challenges actually manifesting in practice makes it difficult to tie solution to problem.\n\n- I appreciate the authors' diligence to organizing components of GTs which might help define a space of architectural choices.  However, this might be better fit for a benchmarks paper or a survey.  Several of the proposals in this manuscript, e.g attention calculation or MP-GNN injection or graph sampling, or structural prior are all choices which have been discussed or introduced individually in relevant works (as Table 1 refers).\n\n- Sec 4.2 details a strategy for masking attention which involves adding a bias to a matrix B with N^2 computed elements based on all-pairs attention.  This would be slow for very large graphs.  Is there a reason we would opt for this instead of e.g. only implementing the attention logic over pairs of nodes which are connected?\n\n- MPNNs are known to suffer scalability challenges for large-scale graphs owing to neighbor explosion issues as several past works have highlighted.  Several works [1, 2] undertake efforts to move away or minimize MPNN usage for large-scale applications where training or inference may suffer given this data dependency.  I am curious about the choice to inject MPNNs (Sec 4.3) as an ingredient towards scaling GTs to large graphs as a result. \n\n- The graphs used for benchmarking (Table 2) are not particularly large in the context of available datasets (e.g. ogbn-products, ogbn-papers100m).  \n\n- Experimental results seem to focus on the discussed variants EAttn and NAttn, but it is not clear that is a key contribution of this work (if it is, it should be highlighted earlier in the intro) -- it sounds like these are mainly derived from Hu et al (2020).  \n\n- It is unclear what parts of the proposed model ParDNTrans are tied to methodological contributions this work aims to put forward -- it seems the components which comprise ParDNTrans are the components in the \"UnifiedGT\" design space which achieve the best performance, but it is not too clear why these components are critical parts of the design space.  \n\n- The paper misses several related large-scale graph learning works, including e.g. pretraining [4], embedding reuse [3], distillation [1, 5].  There is comparatively a lot of literature in large-scale graph learning in the MPNN space compared to GTs, admittedly.\n\n[1] Graph-less Neural Networks: Teaching Old MLPs New Tricks via Distillation (ICLR'22)\n\n[2] Decoupling the depth and scope of graph neural networks (NeurIPS'21)\n\n[3] Gnnautoscale: Scalable and expressive graph neural networks via historical embeddings (ICML'21)\n\n[4] MLPInit: Embarrassingly Simple GNN Training Acceleration with MLP Initialization (ICLR'23)\n\n[5] Linkless Link Prediction via Relational Distillation (ICLR'23)\n\nTypos:\n\n- 2.1 \"Challlenges\" -> \"Challenges\""
