The main concepts of the paper such as layer-wise aggregation, the use of reinforcement learning for model weighting, and dimension reduction have been already considered in federated learning. Please clarify the contribution of the paper compared with the related works, currently, it seems that the contribution is marginal.\n\n2. In a similar context, it is not clear why reinforcement learning is suitable for personalization of federated learning. Learning another deep neural network for DRL agent may incur significant costs. Please justify the rationale of using DRL agent for personalized federated learning.\n\n3. Typically, a lot of experiences is required to learn a DRL policy. In federated learning, is there an enough number of rounds that the DRL policy to be converged? Or, should the DRL policy be trained in advance?\n\n4. How is the multi-head autoencoder trained when using the proposed algorithm? Is it should be trained in advance? This should be clarified in the paper.\n\n5. If the DRL policy or autoencoder should be trained in advance, it should be clarified how the dataset for training them can be obtained before applying federated learning.\n\n6. For a limited number of rounds, it may be doubted that considering accuracy-related rewards (i.e., $r_1$ and $r_2$) will be effective or not. Providing the ablation study of $r_1$, $r_2$, $r_3$ would be helpful to understand the effect of the weights according to the reward structure.\n\n7. It seems that the reward in Eq. (1d) is structured so that the weights closer to the similarity vector have the smaller reward. Hence, it encourages  the weight of the similar client become smaller. But, in my understanding, the concept of the proposed algorithm should encourage the weight of the similar client become larger for personalization.\n\n8. It seems that the weights $p_k$'s from the DDPG should be constrained as to be 1 in sum. How is this realized in the algorithm?"

The approach applies different aggregation strategies to different layers of neural networks. The feature extracting layers (body) use weights proportional to the data sizes of the clients, while the heads employ a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to generate personalized aggregation weights. The DRL agent considers compound rewards that take into account both the improvement of validation accuracy and the similarity between clients. Besides, to reduce the state space, a multi-head auto-encoder is utilized to obtain low-dimensional embeddings of user models.\n\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets with varying levels of data heterogeneity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the idea of separating the body and head for aggregation is not entirely novel, as seen in approaches like pFedLA, which even achieves a finer-grained layer-wise aggregation using the power of hypernetworks. In comparison, this paper only roughly separates the body and head, and cannot be considered truly layer-wise like pFedLA. Additionally, the idea of separating aggregation for the body and head has also been proposed in FedPAC, with a more detailed mathematical logic. Besides, the weighted averaging based on data volume for body aggregation is trivial and straightforward.\n\n2. Although the experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the pFedRLLA framework, there is a lack of theoretical analysis explaining why RL-based methods work better. It seems that the paper provides more intuitive reasoning.\n\n3. In terms of clarity, the paper occasionally fails to clearly differentiate between crucial and supplementary information. For instance, the descriptions accompanying the figures and tables, such as Figure 1 and Table 2, are excessively long, while the corresponding text in the main body appears relatively weaker. The steps mentioned below Figure 1 are relatively concise, but the figure description provides excessive detail, also including redundant content."

Regarding the weight allocation for r1, r2, and r3 (the compacts of validation accuracy and similarity), it is unclear if there is a more in-depth consideration. By the way, it would be better to add a negative sign to r3 to maintain consistency with r1 and r2.\n\n2. Will there be any theoretical analysis provided to explain why RL-based methods outperform existing pFed methods? Besides DDPG, have you attempted other RL methods, and why is DDPG the preferred choice?\n\n3. Regarding clarity, there is room for improvement about the issues raised in Weakness3."
