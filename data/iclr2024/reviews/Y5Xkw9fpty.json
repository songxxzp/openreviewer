                "value": "This paper addresses an intriguing aspect of machine learning: monotonic modeling, focusing specifically on the min-max architecture. The authors thoroughly summarize various techniques and identify a key issue for min-max architecture known as the \"silent neuron\" problem. In response, they propose a smooth variant and develop what they term the SMM architecture. This new architecture demonstrates strong experimental results."

                "value": "This SMM architecture is not only innovative but also well-motivated solution by transitioning from the conventional hard min-max to a LogSumExp-based approach. Furthermore, the paper establishes theoretical guarantees about model's approximation property when the parameter $\\beta$ is sufficiently large.\n\nThe experimental results are another major strength of this work. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the smooth min-max (SMM) architecture, thereby confirming both the practicality and the potential of their approach."

            "weaknesses": {

The authors' exploration of this parameter is fascinating, particularly in light of Corollary 1's suggestion that a lower bound on fitting error is inherently linked to the value of $\\beta$. This implies that a $\\beta$ not sufficiently large would fail to approximate certain functions. Conversely, an excessively large $\\beta$ might impact the training dynamics adversely, as some nearly silent neurons may remain untrained. \n\nWhile the authors utilize trainable $\\beta$ in experiments, the paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of $\\beta$'s behavior during training, such as its trajectory and its relationship with loss changes. Reporting the final values of $\\beta$ after training would also have provided valuable insights."

The authors support their claims by providing empirical evidence on toy examples and on practical data sets."

The main idea of this work of using LogSumExp to act as a smooth approximation while preserving monotonicity does not seem too non-trivial due to its popularity in statistic modelling. However, I am not familiar with the line of work with monotone networks thus I will defer this discussion to other reviewers.\n2) While the empirical comparisons are sufficient, they do not provide evidence (especially after accounting the error bars) to suggest that SSM has significant advantage over existing approaches. It is then unclear why practitioners should prefer SSMs over LMNs or XGBoost."
