They formulate two kinds of attacks: a passive attack where the LLM is fed this information and an active method where the agent is presumed to be assisting the user while simulatenously trying to recover personal information.

                "value": "I enjoyed reading the paper. It demonstrates a variant of \u201clinkability attacks\u201d in LLMs and empirically validates it. \n\n1. Apart from the fact that one can launch such an attack, this reviewer has gained no new technical insight from this work. While this demonstrates \u201cfeasibility\u201d and that is of merit, what do follow-up works look like in this area?\n2. The authors motivate their work by stating that identifying certain attributes is potentially hazardous for people since these attributes can be cross-referenced with public databases to de-identify users. This reviewer believes this claim is a stretch; could the authors highlight how one can deanonymize the users that were present in the dataset they considered? While these claims are \u201ctrue\u201d from an academic sense, making these threats practical requires a lot of additional work which the authors do not factor in.\n3. The reviewer agrees with the authors that the LLM can be used to coerce users into sharing more private information. However, In the adversarial interaction scenario, the attack is easy to thwart. Users could perform prompt injection (as noted in this thread: https://x.com/StudentInfosec/status/1640360234882310145?s=20) and can read the instructions. Given how brittle LLMs are to such forms of attacks, how reliable can such \u201ccoercion attempts\u201d be made?\n4. The notion of \u201cdefenses\u201d against such attacks also seems slim. But should this be something that we need to actively defend against? Sharing posts (as done in the status quo) intrinsically contains some notion of utility that will be removed if the deducible information is scrubbed. Can the authors comment on the same?\n5. While the LLMs are certainly faster than humans, I don\u2019t believe the numbers in this study are the very best humans can do. Could the authors describe how their human baseline can be improved? My understanding is that few humans were tasked with identifying attributes using web search (without much training on this front)."
