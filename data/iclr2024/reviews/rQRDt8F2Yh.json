            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The theoretical argument is interesting, but the experiments are quite weak.  HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 are crippled, and then the new representation is shown to outperform them.  Crippling the baselines might be forgivable if the crippling was irrelevant to the theoretical claims, but it is not.  HuBERT is crippled by not retraining the K-means codebook every few epochs, and wav2vec by removing the codebook entropy loss; these are directly relevant to the theoretical claims, and cause the experimental tests to be insufficient proof of the theoretical claims.\n\nAgainst recommendations in the original HuBERT paper, this paper does not re-train HuBERT's codebook between epochs of transformer training. Figure 2 then shows that the proposed method achieves superior performance because it adapts the quantizer representation in a series of modes, which HuBERT cannot do because the authors chose not to allow it.  Indeed, re-training the K-means codebook in the manner recommended in the original HuBERT article would probably lead to a similar learning curve to VLB.\n\n\"As opposed to previous work in advocating codebook usage\" -- The wording of this paragraph suggests that wav2vec increases a quantity while you decrease the same quantity, which is not true.  Your formulation measures D(q||p); diversity loss measures H(q).  Indeed, this is where the choice to remove H(q) from your wav2vec implementation is particularly troubling.  Wav2vec minimizes -H(q)-Eq[logp(z)], which is exactly D(q||p).  In other words, if you add back the entropy loss, wav2vec is already minimizing exactly the quantity proposed in this paper, and there should be no difference in performance between wav2vec and VLB.\n\nCompared to those, this is a relatively minor point: One of the differences between future prediction and masked prediction is that, using future prediction, it's possible for each frame to serve two roles: to be predicted by its predecessor frames, while it is also a predictor of future frames.  Eq. (2) trivializes this by saying that the sum of all prediction log probabilities is less than or equal to the log probability of predicting the rest of the sequence from the first k frames.\n\nThere are a large number of grammar mistakes that.  Some of them, slowed my understanding of the paper somewhat: notable among these include the strange wording in the second line of the abstract, and the notational error in the second line of the equation in Appendix A.\n\np. 1\n\nit is plausible if -> it is plausible that?

                "value": "The authors present an innovative approach to self-supervised speech representation learning by adopting a variational perspective that unifies existing disparate methods under a predictive coding framework. By using a speech encoder that predicts certain data partitions from others, the system is able to learn predictive knowledge from the signal's context. This includes elements like phonetic details or speaker identity. The novelty lies in their proposition of a variational lower bound (VLB) on the log-likelihood for predicting context from input partitions, framing this process as a generative model with discrete latent variables.\n\nThis variational approach eliminates the need for an additional clustering step found in previous methods and provides a more efficient optimization strategy."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "The strength of paper is that the method is not only aligned with but also extends the reach of other self supervised representation methods. Importantly, their VLB can draw parallels with contrastive objectives that aim to maximize mutual information.\nAdditionally, the authors explore the learning process through an information-theoretic lens, examining the interplay between KL loss (rate) and reconstruction loss (distortion) during training. They find that effective learning occurs in stages where these terms are balanced to achieve a stable latent distribution, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks when the KL divergence between disjoint contexts is minimized."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The authors should have more discussion and conclusion around those speaker verification downstream task, and discuss about why MLM-VLB performs better for phone recognition while causal-VLB performs better for speaker verification. More simulation and visualization of learned feature representations for an example sentence and compare it with other VQ based method would be beneficial and add more values to the work."
