                "value": "I find the main technical result presented in a misleading way: Results 2.1 and 3.1 show that the weight vector and the ODE dynamic are not orthogonal to $\\mu$. I think a better way to describe the behavior of the system would be to span the relevant space via $\\eta$ and $\\hat\\mu_+$ and $\\hat\\mu_-$, corresponding to the empirical mean of the samples at $\\pm\\mu$. I assume that this is also sufficient to span the weight vector (please correct me if I\u2019m wrong), and it would make clear that the model only has access to the empirical means. The remaining results could then be adapted to show how the sampling process is able to reproduce the empirical means of the two modes. Then, the Bayes-optimal baseline could be inserted to show that the empirical estimates go down with Theta(1/n), and that the flow is able to achieve the same rate.\n\nI also find that the research question formulated in the beginning is not really addressed in the main text, whether the network architecture determines whether a generative model memorizes training data. If my above understanding is correct, then the model actually does learn the training data by heart (i.e. it predicts the empirical means), and the rate to the true solution is essentially given how fast empirical means converge to the mean of the generative distribution. Also, the rate $\\Theta(1/n)$ is not affected by the regularization $\\lambda$, and the network architecture is not varied so as to judge wether this particular setup has a particular convergence rate.\n\nMinor points:\n- Formatting of contributions via itemize\n- Sentence? \u201eNote that (9) is a special case of the architecture studied in Cui & Zdeborov\u00e1 (2023), and differs from the very similar network considered in Shah et al.

                "value": "1. How many dimensions are needed to span $\\hat w_t$ for all $t$? From a simple drawing of $\\eta, \\mu_+, \\mu_-$ I conjecture that two dimensions are enough (similar to first weakness).\n\n2. Why is $\\mu \\propto d$ a reasonable scaling? This seems like an unrealistic choice to me. In practice, data is often normalized say to a fixed range $[-1, 1]$ per dimension, so in order to obtain the scaling behavior the means have to be $\\mu = (\\pm 1, \u2026, \\pm 1)$, i.e. both mixture components are at the corners of the hypercube. Alternative question: Does the sample complexity also transfer to $\\|\\mu\\|^2 < O(d)$, e.g. $O(1)$? I would guess that the other directions start playing a role then.\n\n3. What is the solution to this simple setup intuitively? Can you provide a simple drawing of $0, \\eta, \\mu_+, \\mu_-, \\mu, \\eta$ and a learnt trajectory? If the required dimension is indeed two, this should be easy.\n\n4. What is the shape of the learnt distribution within the two clusters, i.e. what is the local density in each cluster?\n\n5. Fig. 2: Why are the learnt means biased in one direction? Is more training data added sequentially?\n\n\nGiven the substantial weaknesses and the above questions, my *preliminary* vote for this paper is therefore not to accept it. I am happy to be corrected in any of the criticisms I raised and look forward to the authors' rebuttal."
