Given the specific camera motion trajectory model, the rendered rolling shutter images can be computed from the global shutter images from the NeRF model.

The proposed methods only contain the basic concept of modeling a rolling shutter.\n- It seems like the proposed method uses the specific motion model of the camera. It might prevent the proposed method from working on the global shutter dataset(no experiment to prove it) and another dataset that cannot be modeled in bicubic motion(no experiment to prove it).\n- The proposed method requires COLMAP to provide an initial camera pose, which is only mentioned in the footnote.\n- To sum up, due to the abovementioned concerns, I cannot give a positive rating to the proposed method in the current version."

USB-NeRF models the physical image formation process of a rolling shutter camera and uses a bundle adjustment framework to optimize the camera poses and scene geometry. The technique unrolls the rolling shutter effect by modeling the exposure time of each pixel and correcting the time-varying motion of the camera. USB-NeRF also uses a neural radiance field to model the scene geometry and appearance, which allows for high-quality novel view synthesis. The paper includes tables and figures that show the quantitative and qualitative comparisons of USB-NeRF with other methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that USB-NeRF achieves better performance compared to prior works in terms of RS effect removal, novel view image synthesis, and camera motion estimation."

Are there any explanations for this?\n\n- Follow the question above. It is expected that BARF can fail under the rolling-shutter setting since each row of the image is recorded at different timestamps. My question is can we build a stronger baseline method that associates each row with a camera pose, then we can use BARF to optimize these camera poses and obtain better results? It can be time-consuming since an image can often have >400 rows, and then we have to optimize too many parameters. A simplified way is to split the image into R row blocks, where R <<< the width/height of that image. Then we have a simplified stronger baseline than BARF."
