Each internal node of the threshold decision tree given by the algorithm is a threshold cut (or an interval cut with two thresholds) on a single feature of the original feature space.\nThey also prove the upper bound on the worst-case price of explainability for kernel k-means clustering. They define the price of explainability for kernel k-means clustering as the ratio of the cost given by the decision tree and the cost of optimal kernel k-means clustering.

The explainable k-means and k-medians clustering generate a threshold decision tree clustering which is easy to understand and visualized by humans. In practice, the data set might not be well-clustered by k-means and k-medians clustering in the original feature space. The kernel method is widely used to map the original data into a well-clustered space. The algorithm utilizes kernel clustering to create an explainable clustering in the original feature space.

The previous works showed that expanding the threshold decision tree to more than k leaves can reduce the clustering cost. Thus it is unclear to me whether the improvement in the clustering cost in the experiments are due to the better kernel clustering or due to these generalized decision tree structure."

Specifically, this work proposes algorithms to approximate kernel k-means methods. Similar approaches have been proposed before for classic k-means algorithms, however practice oftentimes requires more flexible clustering methods such as kernel k-means. The authors propose a variant of the interpretable clustering method Iterative Mistake Minimization (IMM), which is an algorithm that approximates a given k-means clustering by a decision tree with k leaves, where each leaf represents a cluster. The proposed algorithm (Kernel IMM) builds on IMM, and essentially constructs a decision tree to approximate the clusters induced by kernel k-means. Besides Kernel IMM they also present Kernel ExKMC and Kernel Expand, two methods where new leaves are added in a greedy approach to improve accuracy of the tree (potentially at a loss of interpretability). Performance of the approaches is evaluated on a few datasets."

To address the issue of non-injectivity of cluster centers from the RKHS to $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the decision is also made on the proposed surrogate feature maps instead of Euclidean space. Based on these new notions and the previous Iterative Mistake Minimization algorithm for vanilla Explainable Clustering, a kernel IMM algorithm is proposed for several kernels. __Most importantly__, a roughly $O(k^2)$ upper bound on the price of explainability holds for many kernels., when the dimension $d$ is small."

But this seems to be suboptimal in that one should aim to jointly optimize the clustering objective along with the decision tree parameters.\n3) The paper completely discards the approach of fitting a tree on the kernel k-means clustering labels as a supervised problem. It cites the result in Moshkovitz et al. (2020, Section 3), where an unusual Toy 2d example shown to illustrate the bad behavior which rarely occurs in practice. Fitting a classification tree (such as CART or even better algorithms such as optimal MIO-based or alternating optimization-based) on the clustering labels should produce adequate results in practice.\n4) The theoretical bounds on the price of explainability seem to be quite high and not really helpful in practice. For example, does the bound of $O(dk^2)$ mean that say for MNIST the tree will do worse by (784 * 100) times than the unconstrained kernel k-means?
