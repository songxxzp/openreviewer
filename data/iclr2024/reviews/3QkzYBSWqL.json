                "value": "The paper presents a new approach for crafting universal backdoor attacks, i.e. backdoor attacks that target several classes at inference time, as opposed to traditional backdoor attacks that target a single class. In order to mount a universal backdoor attack, the adversary crafts triggers that increase the ASR on several classes simultaneously.  To that end, the authors leverage a pretrained model to extract the feature representation of the training samples, and then craft triggers that correlate with features used by samples from several classes. \n\nThe authors evaluate their attack on several subsets of ImageNet-21k, and against BadNet's baseline presented in Guo et al. By poisoning 0.39% of the training data, the authors are able to mount an effective backdoor attack when no defense is applied. The authors then test the effectiveness of their attack when several defenses are applied, and notice a drop in ASR although the attack remains effective. \n\nFinally, in order to test how much triggers applied to a single class help triggers applied to other classes, the authors fix the number of triggers in some classes, then vary the number of triggers in other classes, and observe the ASR over the fixed classes increases as more poisoned samples are added to other classes."

I would like to see some analysis on the necessary intensity of these triggers and their brittleness to input-space defenses like STRIP.\n- On the defense side, the authors \"[halt] any defense that degrades the model\u2019s clean accuracy by more than 2%.\" I'm open to feedback here, but this has the potential to straw-man some defense mechanisms in scenarios where removing a backdoor is worth the cost of clean accuracy. Including some results without this limitation would be nice.\n- In addition to the above, the attack was not evaluated on data-cleaning defenses like SPECTRE, which I think would be particularly effective against this regime. I would like to see these defenses evaluated as well--and not limited to specific target classes.\n- The experiments are limited to ResNet variants. It would be nice to show generality by including one other architecture in the experiments section.\n  - Since most vision models rely on pretraining, one idea I would find particularly compelling would be to run the attack on a pretrained ViT.\n- In Section 4.4, only a single setting of observed percentage is tried. The analysis here would be stronger if more percentages were tried\n- I'm not sure about the timing here, but the authors claim that they \"are the first to study how to target every class in the data poisoning setting.\" However, while [1,2] address slightly different settings, they seem to be *at least* related and possibly published earlier.\n  - Depending on the nature of this relationship, I would like to see 1) these statements qualified, 2) a more thorough analysis of how the work is positioned in relation to similar work including but not limited to the papers mentioned.\n\n**Citations:**\n\n[1] Du et al., \"UOR: Universal Backdoor Attacks on Pre-trained Language Models.\"\n\n[2] Zhang et al., \"Universal backdoor attack on deep neural networks for malware detection.\""
