It is because CellPLM aggregates the genes within each cell directly in the embedding layer, so it only needs to process dramatically shorter input sequences. So basically, CellPLM works at the cell level, while baselines work at the gene level. If this is true, the Claim \"with 500x times higher inference speed compared to existing pre-trained models.\" is unfair since you are compared to a task that your model is specifically designed for. At least it should be reduced to \"with 500x times higher inference speed when generating cell embeddings\".\n\n- Why does the CellPLM model from scratch outperform most of the pre-trained baselines? This seems to be really unrealistic to me. Is it because your model is much larger than the baselines or cell-level LM is more suitable for the tasks? If the randomly initialized model already outperforms most of the baselines, then we need to re-evaluate the claims in the paper, since the performance boost may mainly result from the Transformer architecture instead of the specific model designs you mentioned.\n\n- There is a lack of ablation study to show the effectiveness of each proposed component."

The model is trained using the variational autoencoder (VAE) objective with a Gaussian prior, which includes a reconstruction term, a conditional prior term, and a cluster prior term. Unlike previous models, the authors leverage spatial data and show that their model outperforms previous models on several tasks.\n\nFurther, they claim that their method is faster than previous methods -- the reason for this is because of collapsing the model input down to cell level representations as opposed to feeding individual gene level tokens"

The authors restrict the gene set to a subset of 13,500 genes, but it is not specified which genes are included or whether they are protein-coding or non-protein-coding. The dataset section should be expanded to include details on how the data was preprocessed.\n\n* **Cell masking:** The authors aggregate cell genes using their embeddings and pass these tokens to the LLM. What does it mean to mask a cell? In the diagram, the cells are masked, but in the equations, the genes are masked. Assuming the masking is at the gene level and samples are taken from the same batch, wouldn't other cell genes have the necessary information to impute the cell? In essence, is the model cheating?\n* **Single-cell operation:** How would the model operate if you only have a single-cell sample? Would you feed a single cell token to the LLM and use the latent representation?\n* **Sequence length:** I'm curious how the model performance would change if you vary the \"sequence length\". For example, in your batch, do you have the same number of genes for each cell?\n* **Spatial information:** How is the spatial information leveraged here? Is it through the positional encoding? What would happen if this positional encoding is removed?\n* **Positional Encoding:** It is not clear if this had a significant improvement in the quality of representation learnt.\n* **Comparison with previous models:** Although the authors compare with previous single-cell models, these models only operated on gene expression data and fed a single cell at a time (i.e., the sequence dimension is the genes within the cell as opposed to other cells, as done in this work).\n* **Benefit of pre-training:** The benefit of which part of the pre-training is the result of the improvements shown in the result section is not clear from the current presentation. Also, the authors don't compare with scVI (although they do cite the method) or even a simpler baseline like HVG.\n* **Gene interactions:** Does the model learn gene level interactions? By feeding cell-level representations, how can this be assessed?\n* **Batch Token:** How would you transfer the model to a dataset which has a new batch token are these fine-tuned as well?"
