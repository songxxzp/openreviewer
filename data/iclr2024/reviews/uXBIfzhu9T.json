The idea extends the setting in treatment effect estimation from multiple treatments, by Wang and Blei 2019. The proposed estimation algorithm involves a two steps paradigm: first identifying the proxy variables using causal structure learning, and then conduct inference with existing estimators. The methodology is further supplemented by identification results, along with synthetic studies and an experiment using the MIMIC III dataset."

They are not designed for multiple outcomes/treatments, but comparing with these methods can give a clear practical implication to the proposed method. \n2. This paper is written towards an audience of applied statistics researchers, and is more suited for a statistical journal such as Biometrika. Although the reviewer acknowledge the importance of rigorous discussing identifiability, the methodology may not be very relevant to the broader community of ICLR. For example, it does not discuss neural network or representation learning at all.\n3. The method requires an additional step of causal discovery for learning the causal structure.\n4. The two-step algorithm design may be suboptimal, especially when the estimation in the second step cruciallly depends on the causal discovery results in the first step."
