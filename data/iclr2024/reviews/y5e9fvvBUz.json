(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08311.pdf), which applies the same subnetwork strategy (edge-pop) for training GANs, and proposes to use the MDD loss for stable training\n\nThis paper just simply combines the two methods to get an FL subnetwork method for generative models, and offers no extra insight beyond those two works in my opinion. It is unfortunately below the acceptance threshold for ICLR, which is why I do not recommend acceptance.\n\n\n\n\nMisc:\n- In Sec 3.1, the edge-pop algorithm was proposed in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.13299v2.pdf), and not in (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf)\n- In Tables 1 and 2, PRISM-alpha entries should be directly replaced with the alpha value, since it is fixed, e.g. PRISM-100 and PRISM-70.

It would be better to quantify it and report that instead. For instance, the hybrid method PRISM-alpha remains \"private\" for all alpha <100, and suddenly becomes non-private when alpha=100?"

On one hand, can PRISM attain equivalent efficiency to traditional FL, which directly uploads local parameters? On the other hand, when we consider the attack of inferring the client's local dataset, can PRISM provide robust protection against such attacks?

                "value": "1. The performance in some experiments is somehow too surprisingly good to convince me. I am not fully convinced that a randomly initialized model without training can outperform a carefully designed and trained generative model. Let alone the score selection criterion is MMD, which is known to be suboptimal for image generation. Is it because of data partitioning? Could the authors elaborate more on this part?\n\nOverall, though the work is a straightforward application of the strong lottery ticket hypothesis, it still could be valuable to the community. However, the authors have to specify all the details, especially regarding the DP part. I am willing to reconsider my score after the discussion with other reviewers and the authors."
