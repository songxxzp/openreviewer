Then the parameters could be found by backpropagating through the integration to the parameters. But naively this would not require a sequence model, which is describe to take in a sequence and output a single scalar through mean aggregation. It's not obvious to me what the neural network is actually being used for. Is it also being used to integrate the process in some way? The presentation could be improved significantly with appropriate explanatory figures or at least a description of the actual training loss and simulation procedure."

            "questions": {
                "value": "Is it possible the baselines are too weak? They seem to be *significantly* worse than a straightforward application of sequence models. It's a little hard to believe there aren't other deep learning methods that could be used as baselines here. There is has been substantial work on learning SDEs (e.g. Patrick Kidger's work) and other stochastic processes with neural networks (e.g. neural diffusion processes) and those methods might be applicable here. \n\nWhat is the intended use case for this model? In the paper it states that the setup implies there is infinite data. I see how this is true when fitting models to synthetically generated data, but it's almost certainly not true when attempting to fit real world data. If this is meant to be used in the types of financial or scientific applications described in the introduction to the paper, why not apply it directly to those applications and evaluate how fell it performs in terms of MSE?"
