                "value": "This paper addresses the problem of federated reinforcement learning in the presence of environmental heterogeneity, where agents operate in diverse environments characterized by the same state and action spaces but distinct transition dynamics and reward functions. The authors derive perturbation bounds on the TD fixed points, which quantify the deviation of the fixed points based on the heterogeneity in the agents' MDPs. To establish the analysis results, the authors explore the properties of the virtual MDP, a concept introduced by the existing work on federated reinforcement learning with environmental heterogeneity. The paper's contributions include the development of a federated version of the TD algorithm tailored for this particular setup and the analysis results suggesting that under the assumption that all specified conditions are met, the study reveals that the linear convergence speedups are achievable with linearly parameterized models in a low-heterogeneity regime, which corresponds to scenarios approaching the homogenous case."

One of the key contributions of this paper is the investigation of the approximation error in federated learning as a function of environmental heterogeneity, which is then used to develop a federated version of the TD algorithm specifically tailored for the considered scenario. This algorithm leverages the advantages of federated learning to facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration among the agents, improving the overall learning process. The result is significant, although I did not assess the correctness of all the proofs."

                "value": "The paper has a lot of flaws in analysis. \n\n-  In the abstract, the authors assert that the HFTD achieves linear speedup. Yet, the sample complexity is expressed as $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\right)$, which doesn't scale with the number of agents $N$. This reveals an inconsistency between the theoretical analysis and the assertions made in the main text.\n\n- The average mean gradient $\\bar{g}(\\theta)$ doesn't equal to the gradient of Eq(6). This discrepancy arises because $\\bar{A}$ is nonsymmetric, whereas a true gradient should be such that the hessian is symmetric. Although Eq. (6) defines the objective of the HFTD algorithm as minimizing the MSPBE, the algorithm actually converges to $\\theta^*$, which satisfies the average mean gradient $\\bar{g}\\left(\\theta^*\\right)=0$. Hence, $\\theta^*$ does not denote the MSPBE's minimum.  As such, HFTD failed in finding the optimal value of the MSPBE.\n\n- The paper's main body contains multiple conflicting statements. The abstract mentions a mixed environment as the average of $N$\nheterogeneous environments. However, in Sec 4, it's conveyed that this environment is randomly drawn from the heterogeneous environments. These descriptions are contradictory.\n\n- The authors didn't provide a fair comparison between the results of their paper and those of existing works. In table (1), the objective of Wang (2023) was to find the optimal value function of $i$-th agent, which more focused on the personalization. However, in this paper, the objective function is to find the optimal value function of all $N$ environments, which was in the average sense. If the authors changed the optimality to $i$-th agent's optimal value function,  their methods still cannot converge exactly without the gradient heterogeneity in Assumption 2.\n\n- The bound was quite loose and coarse. The standard convergence result in FL supervised learning [1] is $O(\\frac{1}{NTK})$. However, this paper only gave a result of $O(\\frac{1}{T}})$, which can not be scaled by $N$ and $K$.\n\n[1] Karimireddy, Sai Praneeth, Satyen Kale, Mehryar Mohri, Sashank Reddi, Sebastian Stich, and Ananda Theertha Suresh. \"Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning.\" In International conference on machine learning, pp. 5132-5143.

Does this match the existing results in the centralized TD setting [2]?\n\n* As mentioned before, $\\theta^*$ satisfying $\\bar{g}\\left(\\theta^*\\right)=0$ can only find the optimal value function corresponding to the mixture environment, which was a weighted average of $N$ heterogenous environments in Lemma 3. Why should we consider to find this $\\theta^*$? What is the motivation of finding $\\theta^*$? Because  $\\theta^*$ may not equal to the average value function across all agents.\n\n* What is the motivation of doing federation? From the results, the sample complexity can not be scaled by $N$? What's the incentive and benefit for each agent to join the federation?\n\n[2] Bhandari, Jalaj, Daniel Russo, and Raghav Singal. \"A finite time analysis of temporal difference learning with linear function approximation.\" In Conference on learning theory, pp. 1691-1692.
