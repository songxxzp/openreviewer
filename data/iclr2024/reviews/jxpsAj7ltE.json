Specifically:\n\n- Soft MoE L/16 vs ViT H/14:\n    - Half the training time\n    - 2x faster inference\n- Soft MoE B/16 vs ViT/14:\n    - 5.7x faster at inference time\n\nThese results are demonstrated comprehensively with ablation experiments investigating the different assumptions, such as whether the weighted sum is necessary, whether the weighted sum can be uniform and whether the weighted sum at the output is necessary; finding that the decisions all improve performance.\n\nThe results are demonstrated on expensive large scale benchmarks, including training many ViT style models on JFT-4B and further experiments testing these models on a contrastive benchmark using WebLI. The results presented support the contributions of the paper, demonstrating improved performance across the experiments compared to other MoE methods.\n\nThe authors also note that the proposed method would violate the causal assumption if used in an autoregressive model, meaning it can't be used as defined above for autoregressive language modelling. \n\n[lucidrains]: https://github.com/lucidrains/soft-moe-pytorch/blob/main/soft_moe_pytorch/soft_moe.py"

The major part that I like is that this combination is very practical in large scale model that requires model parallelism. The author also clearly contrasted its difference with other existing works and multi-head attention in Section 5. \n\nQuality\nThe quality of the paper is high. \n-\tThe author provides very good details of how the method is implemented and some details of implementation.\n-\tThe experiments settings are clearly stated and the hyper-parameter searching is transparent and properly done for contrast models (dense models and other MOE models) as well.\n-\tThe design choices (slots per token and expert numbers) are well studied and concluded.\n-\tThe experiments conducted are at large scale datasets and on various tasks/settings, and the improvement of the proposed methods are convincingly large.\n\nClarity\nThe clarity of the paper is good. The demonstration of the method and experiment conclusions are clear and well supported by experiments.\n\nSignificance\nThis is very exciting work that can impact the community greatly. The proposed method shows convincing performance dominancy over other MOE methods or dense models on image classification task and contrastive learning tasks. It shows that with similar inference cost, it can achieve much better accuracy metric, even against strong baselines. It is also very practical that it can be used in modern large scale parallel learning platforms without too much extra optimization needed."

Thanks to this, Soft MoE are able to alleviate training instability, token dropping, scalability issues, and ineffective finetuning process that is apparent in previous type of MoE. Experiments on visual recognition tasks in Section 3 and 4 show the superiority of Soft MoE over dense Vision Transformers (ViT) and popular MoEs not limited to Tokens Choice and Experts Choice. In addition to that, Soft MoE provably scales well; since while the Huge/14 version of it has $40\\times$ more parameters than ViT Huge/14, it bring substantial improvement in terms of classification accuracy with only 2% gain in inference."
