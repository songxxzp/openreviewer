The agent is hierarchically organized, with a higher-level agent deciding on the block and a lower-level deciding the other three variables for storing a container. The reward function seems to be a 5-tuple of cost functions with are combined by a weighted sum. However, these seemed to be shaped rewards, and it is unclear if the final agent is evaluated by these shaped immediate rewards or something else.\nThe policy function is based on a pointer network with LSTM encoder and decoder and applied on both levels. The agent is trained with Soft Actor Critic.\nThe authors compare their agent with a flat SAC variant, a random agent, and three heuristics. The agents are compared with respect to the defined reward functions which makes it somewhat difficult to understand what the results should actually tell the reader."

The \"expert strategies\" are very simple heursitic rules. For expert strategy 1, directly selecting actions by maximizing immediate reward is known to be a poor policy for sequential decision making. For other strategies, there is no evidence that they will optimize the complicated reward defined in this paper. More advanced SLAP methods (which are available in the literature) should be compared against.\n\n3. This paper lacks a comprehensive problem description, and many details are unclear.

To illustrate the innovative nature of the proposed methodology, the novel aspects of the proposed method and why it is well-suited for the SLAP should be extensively discussed.\n5. In order to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methodology, some baselines with better performance should be added, such as meta-heuristic methods and DRL methods.\n6. The DRL baseline, single SAC, cannot learn any effective policies. Is this phenomenon caused by hyper-parameters? Some DRL algorithms that can learn effective policies for SLAP should be included as baselines.\n7. The computational complexity should be rigorously discussed in this paper."
