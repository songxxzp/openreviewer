                "value": "The paper delves into the exploration of influence structures within Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems. The authors introduce influence measurement functions, serving as a comprehensive descriptive framework for understanding influence structures across various common settings. Within this framework, they introduce both total and state influence measures, specifically tailored to the context of average reward settings. The paper goes on to offer a rigorous theoretical analysis, focusing on the stability of these measures, as well as providing insights into the convergence properties and error bounds of the corresponding approximation algorithms. In addition to theoretical contributions, the authors conduct experiments in randomly generated environments to showcase the convergence of approximation errors, even in scenarios involving evolving policies. Moreover, the \"coin game\" experiment is presented as an example, demonstrating the practical applicability of these concepts in complex and dynamic settings. This experiment sheds light on the understanding of influence within black-box environments. Overall, this work sheds valuable light on the intricate world of influence structures in MARL systems, offering both theoretical insights and practical applicability in diverse and dynamic scenarios."
