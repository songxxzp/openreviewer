                "value": "The paper contributes a dataset, termed ETGraph, that links Ethereum addresses with Twitter accounts. The dataset is structured in the form of a heterogeneous graph and inlcudes links between pairs of Ethereum addresses that transact with each other, links between Twitter accounts that follow/are followed by each other and links between Ethereum addresses and Twitter accounts that have been matched to be owned by the same (typically, physical) entity/person. This information has been scraped from opensea and the public Twitter API. The dataset also includes information about (a relatively small number of) money-laundering addresses. \n\nIn addition, the paper also evaluates the dataset over a series of benchmark Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Specifically, it compares whether the new dataset (with Twitter data) improves the ability of the models to predict Q1) links between Ethereum addresses, i.e., transactions, Q2) money laundering addresses, and Q3) matches between Ethereum addresses and Twitter accounts. With few exceptions, most evaluations suggest improved performance - at average levels around 6%-8% (maybe higher in some cases/lower in others) - with the new dataset in a couple of standard metrics including ROC, AUC, precision, recall and F1 scores."

I am not very familiar with dataset papers, so maybe this is generally so. \n- For this reason, I cannot comment on the ethical considerations about releasing such a dataset. \n- Q2 in the evaluation seems to make no sense to me: since there are only 3 matched addresses in the dataset, why should we anticipate improved performance with this dataset? The results are, thus, questionable to me regarding Q2. \n- The insight that Twitter-matched addresses are more active in Ethereum is rather expected since Twitter is known to be popular (as the authors also confirm) by main actors of the Ethereum ecosystem. \n- On a subjective comment, I am not sure if ICLR is the right venue to maximize visibility for this type of datasets. However, Chartalist, a recent publication in NeurIPS about a related blockchain dataset seems to suggest the contrary. Also, related to my comment about ethical considerations above, the authors seem to have followed the related discussion on openreview about Charalist and have included statements in the appendix. However, I am not in a position to assess those, because I am not aware of the exact regulations regarding such datasets. For this reason, I raise a flag for ethics review below - but I would be happy to take it down if this is clarified.\n- There are some technical things that I discuss below, but these seems to be more minor in nature. As an example, the set of features degree (3 features) and neighbor (3 features) seem to be highly linearly correlated (as also suggested by their statistics in Table 3). Keeping only of them, i.e., one from the \"degree\" family, and one from the \"neighbor\" family, would potentially improve the performance of the networks. I provide a couple of more minor comments below."

So, here, you mean that look at the degree of the node or that \"Degree\" is some kind of network like BERT and Deepwalk in the next two boxes of that column? I found this slightly confusing. Also, which structural features are extracted here since ETH addresses don't contain any further information.\n- Below Figure 2: \"The total collection accounts for 30,387 Twitter profiles\". I was confused here: why is this lower than the initial number (since, according to the previous lines more data was added) and why are Followers and Friends useful here? Friends are not discussed elsewhere if I am not wrong.\n\nTrivia: \n- should it be Twitter or X :)? \n- is it 19 billion or 190 billion as of September 23, the market value for Ethereum (page 1)? \n- please define abbreviations the first time that they are used, e.g., AUC.\n\nNote on my score: although I rated the paper as slightly above the acceptance threshold, I may decrease my score if my concerns are not addressed. I also hope that through the discussion, I will be able to increase my confidence.\n\n**Post-rebuttal**: Based on the authors' response, I raised my score to 8. I cannot remove the ethics flag, but, I believe that the authors have addressed this concern. I will not increase my confidence, since datasets is not my exact area of expertise - although, I am fairly confident that this dataset will be useful to blockchain research."

In Section 3.3, the authors claim, \u2018we obtain embeddings for all Twitter accounts using the DeepWalk algorithm in the Twitter graph\u2019. Figure 2 also shows structural features given by deep walk. However, as stated in Appendix, only the handcrafted 8 features from C.1 are used.\n\n3.
