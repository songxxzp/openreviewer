In their proposed model, the insurer has access to all data except the sensitive attributes and the third party uses the transformed data from the insurer plus the sensitive information to make fair pricing predictions. The authors test their method on the Adult income dataset and compare accuracy for varied values of privacy budget."

Although the authors mention that the biggest strength of their work (especially in comparison to previous works -relatedworks) is their model working under any given loss function, in their theory and empirical work, the focus is on logistic regression. The authors (reasonably) defend this choice as a tradeoff between transparency and complexity, which makes it hard to appreciate author contributions.\n\n- Since noise levels have a significant effect on risk-LDP, I am curious about the effect of overestimating and underestimating noise on fairness and the impact on different sensitive groups, especially in the case of unevenly distributed groups.\n\n- Several challenges are associated with a multi-party framework, for example, information leakage, computation overhead, etc..  I am curious how the proposed method would be comparatively better than those settings where fairness is computed on (single-party) fully differentially private data (X,D) or where causal inference (and other methods) is used to perform fairness in the absence of sensitive attributes. \n\n- Experimental setup and results. There are other (single-party) fair decision-making with private data methods and noisy sensitive attributes that the authors could have compared their work with. Although authors show different error rates with varied privacy budgets, it would have been informative to see how the method compares to other (similar) methods. Additionally, authors say they couldn't find insurance-like data, but there are at least 50 insurance datasets on Data World (and other platforms)."

The insurance industry pursues actuarial fairness, a concept distinctive from the more commonly studied algorithmic fairness, and there lacks effective methods for designing pricing models that are actuarial fair. Motivated by this research gap, this paper proposed a method to train actuarial fair models for the practical scenario where an insurer has access to non-sensitive attributes, and a trusted third-party (TTP) partner has access to the corresponding privatized sensitive attributes. The proposed training method only requires access to privatized sensitive attributes via the TTP. The authors demonstrated the validity of their method by deriving relevant statistical guarantees and showing empirical effectiveness on an income prediction task."

It is unclear whether this formulation is practical, and whether it is a broadly accepted formulation. Further literature review on its usage and potentials in practice will be helpful. On a related note, the term \u2018actuarial fairness\u2019 was used in the introduction paragraph without defining what it is. While I understand it was formulated later in the mathematical definition, it will be helpful to see how the insurance industry defines \u2018actuarial fairness\u2019 on the conceptual level first. \n\nI also found it difficult to pinpoint what is novel in the paper. One motivation mentioned in the beginning of the paper is that the difference between actuarial fairness and other conventional algorithmic fairness notions calls for new fair algorithms, but it is unclear why a fair algorithm designed under privacy considerations for a conventional fairness concept would not work. It seems that the difficult comes from the unavailable sensitive attribute, but this is not an issue unique to the insurance pricing application. In addition, for the derivation of theoretical results, it would be useful to know whether and how the fairness or the noise or the multi-party training flow leads to challenges."

If so, can the algorithms be generalized?"
