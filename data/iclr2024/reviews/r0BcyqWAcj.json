My guess is that much of the performance gain is coming from this. \n\nI have a variety of smaller questions which the authors may like to answer, but overall it seems to me that this paper needs a very heavy rewrite."

What is the idea here? \n\nThe paper mentions that the decoder \"reconstructs the predicted scene via slot-wise density maps as object masks.\" What are slot-wise density maps? \n\nThe paper briefly mentions an \"L0 loss on gate openings\" but it is not clear what ground truth is used for this loss. Is it maybe just a regularization term, penalizing the L0 norm?\n\nSection 2.2 introduces a depth input and an equation to normalize it, but it is not clear where this fits with the inner loop described in the previous section.\n\nFor Table 2 it would be great to clarify what dataset these experiments happen in, and what the metrics are."
