Compared with variational inference (VI), importance-weighted sampling (IS) provides a more directed way of estimating and maximizing the marginal log-likelihood. To increase the effectiveness of this estimator, this paper proposes a sequence of bridge proposal distributions for sampling the latent variable $H$, and develops the corresponding stochastic gradient annealed algorithm. Results on the toy datasets show outstanding performance of AIS compared to other baseline methods. Besides, the new model and algorithm is able to learn the model with missing data and get a better prediction for the unseen data."

While this is a double-edge sword and certainly improvements could be made, I think the effort made by the authors is quite clear.\n\n3. The AIS approach allows for the analysis of complex data structures and high-dimensional spaces, which were challenging with previous methods. This increases the applicability and usefulness of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GPLVMs) in various domains by combining Sequential Monte Carlo samplers and Variational Inference (VI). This enables a wider range of posterior distribution exploration, leading to better understanding and modelling capabilities.\n\n4. The authors propose an efficient algorithm by reparameterizing all variables in the ELBO, which leads to a simpler gradient computation and therefore an easier process to optimize model parameters during training.\n\n5.

On the same line as the previous point, I expect the authors to release some version of the code used to produce these results. This is not mentioned in the text and I deem reproducibility to be considered an important factor.\n\n3. The selection of hyperparameter values appears to play a crucial role in the performance of the presented method. Finding optimal values for parameters such as step size ($\\eta$) or the selected number of bridging densities ($K$) may prove to be expensive and quite important in the final results. Moreover, even though it appears to be more restricted due to their usage, the choice for the evolution of $\\beta_k$ coefficients, while contained in $\\[0,1\\]$ needs to be properly crafted as well.\n\n4.

This may make it more challenging to implement and understand, especially for researchers or practitioners with limited experience in this area.\n\n### Minor:\n\n* Considering the information conveyed in the text, I think the article is quite well written. However, at some points, I think it could be managed so that the discussion flows better. I suggest the authors summarize further the introduction in favour of section 2 so that further details can be provided about the required background since currently it is only touched on lightly and some ideas are pivotal here. On this same line, I suggest the authors include further references in the part of the text surrounding Eqs. 2,3 and 4, especially when mentioning something deemed to be \"the classical MF-ELBO\" or a \"typical approximation\".
