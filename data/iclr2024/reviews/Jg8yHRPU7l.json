                "value": "One notable weakness of this paper is the omission of several relevant works. The U-shaped behavior under consideration has been investigated since at least 2017, if not earlier. Having only a one-page reference list is not enough. As this paper mainly focuses on the theoretical explanation, below I will highlight some theoretical contributions in this domain:\n\n[1] Sanjeev Arora, et al. \"Fine-grained analysis of optimization and generalization for overparameterized two-layer neural networks.\" ICML 2019.\n\nConsider Question 1 in [1], *Why do true labels give faster convergence rate than random labels for gradient descent?* In comparison with the question asked in the second paragraph of your introduction, *how can the model tell clean samples from noisy ones ...*. At least to me, [1] and you study a similar question. \n\nApplying the findings from [1] to respond to the question asked in this paper: neural networks trained with GD learn clean samples faster or in the early phase because true labels align well with top eigenvectors of the NTK matrix whereas projections of random labels are close to being uniform. While [1] studies a two-layer ReLU network, their analysis does not require the infinite width (although it should still be sufficiently wide).\n\n\n[2] Madhu S. Advani, et al. \"High-dimensional dynamics of generalization error in neural networks.\" Neural Networks 2020.\n\n[3] Zhenyu Liao and Romain Couillet. \"The dynamics of learning: A random matrix approach.\" ICML 2018.\n\n[2,3] use Random Matrix Theory to study the over-training and early-stopping. They also provide insights into why models tend to learn clean data first and later overfit to noisy data. Notably, the analysis in [2] shares fundamental similarities with that in [1]. While [3] focuses solely on linear models, it's worth noting that, considering this paper allows the width of neural networks to go to infinity, the analysis presented here may not have a significant advantage.\n\nAlso see:\n\n[4] Sheng Liu, et al. \"Early-learning regularization prevents memorization of noisy labels.\" NeurIPS 2020.\n\n[5] Yu Feng and Yuhai Tu. \"Phases of learning dynamics in artificial neural networks in the absence or presence of mislabeled data.\" Machine Learning: Science and Technology 2021.\n\n[6] Zitong Yang, et al. \"Rethinking bias-variance trade-off for generalization of neural networks.\" ICML 2020.\n\nThey all attempt to explain the U-shaped behavior, and [4] provides a similar explanation for why gradients from clean data vanish with this paper. I will refrain from listing more, but additional relevant works do exist."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. It seems the dominance of clean samples gradient is due to the fact that the majority of training samples are not corrupted. Could you conduct experiments on $\\delta>0.5$ (e.g., $\\delta=0.8$), and track the gradients and the errors on clean and noisy data? Do the theoretical findings suggest that the neural networks will fit noisy samples first if $\\delta>0.5$? \n\n2. Can the analysis in this paper address epoch-wise double descent? Specifically, considering Figure 9 in the deep double descent paper (Nakkiran et al., 2021), given that this paper assumes neural network width goes to infinity (closer to the \"Large Model\" setting in Figure 9, Left), the testing curve should exhibit a \"double descent\" behavior rather than a U-shaped curve, according to the previous observation. Could you elaborate on this?\n\n3. A minor point: The paper's title includes \"early stopped\" and \"infinite width\", yet the abstract mentions neither. Moreover, \"early stopped\" might not be a critical keyword; perhaps \"early phase\" or \"early stage\" would be more appropriate?"

The authors investigate the behavior of neural networks when trained with datasets containing random label noise. They observe that the prediction error of a neural network on a noise-free test dataset initially improves during early training but eventually deteriorates, showing a U-shaped dependence on training time. The authors refer to this observed behavior as \"clean-priority learning\", where neural networks seem to learn the pattern of clean data first and fit the noise later. The study aims to explore the learning dynamics underlying this phenomenon. The authors demonstrate that in the early stages of training, the update direction of gradient descent is primarily determined by the clean samples of training data, minimizing the impact of noisy samples."
