                "value": "This work introduces a new method, called Deceptive-NeRF,  which leverages diffusion models to synthesize pseudo observations to improve the few-shot NeRF reconstruction. This approach first reconstructs a coarse NeRF from sparse input data, and then utilizes the coarse NeRF to render images and subsequently generates pseudo-observations based on them. Last, a refined NeRF model is trained utilizing input images augmented with pseudo-observations. A deceptive diffusion model is proposed to adeptly convert RGB images and depth maps from coarse NeRFs into photo-realistic pseudo-observations, while preserving scene semantics for reconstruction. Experiments on the synthetic Hypersim dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of synthesizing photo-realistic novel views with very sparse inputs."

                "value": "The idea of introducing pseudo observations to enhance the reconstruction of few-shot Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) is a promising concept. If the diffusion model can effectively generate pseudo observations that align with the data distribution of a given scene, it has the potential to improve the quality of the refined NeRF reconstructions.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the generalization capacity of the proposed deceptive diffusion model. The real-world scenes' data distribution is often highly intricate and diverse. However, the diffusion model is only trained on a limited dataset consisting of 40 scenes and 2000 synthetic images from the Hypersim dataset during the second stage. As the primary experiment relies on the Hypersim dataset, which shares similarities with the training data, the method's performance on the real LLFF dataset is disappointing. In specific metrics and view-number configurations, it even falls short of the freeNeRF (note that the proposed method also uses the same frequency regularization as in freeNeRF). These outcomes indicate that the proposed approach struggles to generalize to the complexities of real-world scenes.\n\nIt would be valuable to include a comparative analysis between the generated pseudo observations and the ground-truth images. This could provide insights into the fidelity of the pseudo observations and their accuracy in replicating the real data.\n\nInformation regarding the optimization time required for scene reconstruction is crucial for understanding the method's practicality and efficiency. Including this information in the paper would be helpful for readers seeking to assess the computational demands of implementing this approach.\n\nIn Table 1, a more robust baseline for scene reconstruction might be considered, such as the monoSDF method that utilizes monocular depth and normal maps as additional sources of supervision. Comparing the proposed method's performance to such a strong baseline would provide a clearer picture of its relative merits and limitations."

It's core idea is to train an initial radiance field based on the small number of views, and then generate novel views in this low quality field which are subsequently enhanced using a diffusion model. The resulting higher quality views can then be used to train a higher quality neural radiance field. In terms of technical novelty, most of the substance focuses on training the enhancement diffusion model. Ideally, such training would require the availability of neural fields (both degraded and high quality) for a big number of scenes which is computationally prohibitive. Thus, the authors train the diffusion model to restore a noise corrupted input image (+ depth). The work is shown to outperform other baselines using neural fields."
