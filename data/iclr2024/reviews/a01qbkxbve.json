                "value": "This paper provides O3D (Offline Data-driven Discovery and Distillation), a new prompting method for Large Language Model (LLM) agents to solve decision-making tasks. The main idea of O3D is to use offline trajectory data to improve a base prompt for a LLM agent. To do this, the paper reformulates a LLM-based policy p(a | tau) as a LLM-based policy parameterized by prompts LLM(a | tau; prompt). More specifically, O3D discovers primitive skills from offline trajectory data by using a LLM, and construct a skill-conditioned prompt. Then, O3 distills improvement tips from offline trajectory data by using a LLM, and improvs the base prompt by conditioning the distilled tips. In summary, O3D consists of three stages: (1) offline skill discovery and data segmentation, (2) offline policy improvement with distilled improvement tips, and (3) hierarchical policy execution. Providing experiment results on ALFWorld and WeShop, this paper shows that O3D can provides better success rate than ReAct, a recent representative method."

Since this paper combines many techniques such as skill-conditioning in a prompt, prompt refinements by improvement tips, and code-based policy, it is rather hard what is the main contribution. If the main contribution is to improve a base prompt by using textual tips, how does O3D differ from recent works like Reflexion? \n\n- W2. One of main concerns on this paper is experiment. Since this paper compares O3D with only one baseline (i.g., ReAct for text-based policy and Demo2Cod for code-based policy), it is hard to properly assess the performance. For example, there are more recent works such as Reflexion for text-based policy. It is highly required to add more recent works and properly compare O3D with them. Also, the ReAct paper provides its performance by using PaLM and text-davinci-002 (GPT-3). However, this paper provides results based on GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. This mismatch makes the comparison more difficult. \n\n- W3. According to Table 1 and 2, code-based policy does not work well in WebShop. This result does not seem to support that O3D consistently outperforms baselines in both text-based policy and code-based policy across various LLMs.\n\n- W4. The proposed method seems more suitable for ALFWorld than WebShop. I am not sure that O3D is generally applicable to diverse environments."

Beyond this, in the second stage, how is the LLM's performance is doing the sub-trajectory extraction? It would be great to provide this more fine-grained analysis to understand the limitations and effectiveness of different stages.\n\n- Another question that I am curious is that how is the trajectory contrasting compared with RLHF? Given a fixed set of contrasting trajectories, it would be more effective to prompting the models to extract general tips, or it would be great to distill the knowledge using RLHF?\n\n- For stage 2, how many samples are used to generate primitives as well as distilled tips? And how the positive and negative examples sampled in learning the tips?\n\n- Could you comment more on the effectiveness of self-learned tips generated using Step 2 and human-generated principles?

The O3D Human baseline sounds tricky since humans can give almost as good knowledge of skills and primitives as LLMs'.\n3.

In the pseudocode of algorithms 2 and 3, I'm wondering how to implement the 'segment process' in order to segment them based on skills, is this process also done by the LLMs?\n3. Why in Alfworld GPT3.5-0613 is much worse than GPT3.5-0301?\n4. For 'Trajectory Contrasting', how to choose trajectories for the LLMs to compare, do you pick similar trajectories or randomly sample the trajectories to compare?\n5.  In this paper, the authors argue that one of reasons that skill distillation and tip distillation are important is due to the lack of context length, since the experiments are conducted with GPT4. I think maybe some experiments with GPT4-32k should be conducted to see what will happen when only prepending sufficient long history in the prompt and comparing the results with the proposed framework."
