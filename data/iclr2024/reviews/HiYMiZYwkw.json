I understand the goal is to keep it somewhat agnostic to task, architecture (self/cross-attention etc), but essential components can still be sketched. Algorithm 1 (which appears by the way too early in the text) to some extent covers this, but not totally.   \n2) Am I right to assume (3) - (5) are a mathematical notation of Fig. 1? If so, this is one of those examples where math becomes more of a problem than a solution! \n3) The improvement SMA offers in settings without strong priors (such as protein property prediction, and chemical property prediction) is marginal, which is fine. However, here a simple random masking pattern seems to work pretty well, and that can be an efficient natural choice which is difficult to argue against. (See Tables 1, 2, 3 and 5). \n4) I think it would be useful to have some reflections on the computational complexity (time and/or model space) of SMA. Is it the reason why ImageNet-100 is chosen instead of ImageNet itself?\n\n5) The paper can benefit from another proof read; e.g. here are some minor suggestions:\n\n    a) On page 2: These architectures demonstrates \u2026 => Demonstrate\n\n    b) On page 3: Formally for an unlabeled \u2026 => Formally, \n\n    On Page 4: the inputs of a single \"group,\" => \u201cgroup\u201d, \n\n    On Page 9: also use resize image \u2026 ? Doesn\u2019t read well.\n\n    And several others. \n\n6) Other suggestions:\n\n    a) I wouldn\u2019t use capital letters for sets (but \\mathcal{}) to avoid confusion with a constant value. \n\n    b) I would avoid using two different l\u2019s for the loss function and for query dimensions.\n\n    c) Clarify the notation of mixed floor/ceiling in (3), in the subsequent paragraph.  \n\n   d) Please refer to table numbers in the text, this way the reader has to look for table content to associate it with descriptions. Table 5 is all of a sudden cited in the text! \n\n    e) Even though self-explanatory to some extent, the algorithm is left unreferenced and unexplained."

And why would (3) help to elevate this bottleneck?\n\n3) In Table 1,  why shouldn\u2019t one pick random masking? It seems to function as good as SMA, and the prior art, no? It\u2019s way more efficient as well."

                "value": "This paper presented a Self-Guided Masked Autoencoder for domain-agnostic SSL, with experiments largely focusing on data from scientific domains such as biology, chemistry, and physics. It selects tokens to mask via attention maps from the first encoding layer (either self-attention or cross-attention) and masks the tokens with high aggregated attention weights. The authors argue that such an approach masks highly correlated semantic regions regardless of domain priors. The authors show strong results in protein biology, chemical property prediction, and particle physics.\n\nThis paper works on an interesting topic with great potential impact and it is clearly written; however, the paper slightly lacks quality, therefore the reviewer recommends a borderline rejection."

                "value": "Originality: the method is inspired by Perceiver (Jaegle 2021b) and adapted the latent query technique to the attention module in masked autoencoder. Although the method is not particularly novel, the reviewer reckons that this is the first work to improve MAE\u2019s domain-agnostic property via attention-map-based mask selection. There are other mask selection works, but they are primarily domain-specific [1, 2].\n\nClarity: the paper has a good flow and is, in general, easy to read.\n\nSignificance: domain-agnostic SSL is an important research topic as the community is seeing the merging of multi-domain, multi-modality pretraining. This paper serves as a nice step forward in this direction by using a generic attention-based mask selection technique for MAE pre-training.\n\n[1] Li, Gang, et al. \"Semmae: Semantic-guided masking for learning masked autoencoders.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 35 (2022): 14290-14302.\n\n[2] Wilf, Alex, et al. \"Difference-Masking: Choosing What to Mask in Continued Pretraining.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14577 (2023)."

                "value": "Post-rebuttal update: the responses include new experimental comparisons and successfully address all of the reviewer's concerns. Therefore, the reviewer updated the rating.\n\n------\n\nOriginality: the paper did not cite or compare other domain-agnostic SSL methods, either contrastive [3] or masking [4]. Also, the key components, latent query tokens (Jaegle 2021b) and the KeepTopK (Shazeer et al. 2017) are not novel, further weakening the originality of this work.\n\nQuality: the quality of this work is lacking. Empirical performance improvement can be limited, such as results for the MoleculeNet (Table 2), where the proposed method is sometimes worse than the baseline method (BACE and HIV of Uni-Mol-20M), or improvement can seem limited (Lipo). While a lower performance is common, since there are only limited baselines (TabNet for the HIGGS benchmark and baselines for the HIGGS benchmark are all from 2021 or prior) and this work is quite empirical, the performance difference can seem noticeable. Nevertheless, the reviewer is not familiar with the benchmarks and did not extensively search for new work with higher results, and will hugely benefit from a response from the authors explaining why the baselines are few. \n\nClarity: some parts of the paper seem confusing; the details are in the Questions section.\n\n[3] Verma, Vikas, et al. \"Towards domain-agnostic contrastive learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

And more importantly, why Eq.(1) defines domain-agnostic? It is not clear as there are no direct citations or proof supporting this claim (the Perceiver paper did not seem to include any specific math statement like this). The reviewer would appreciate more explanation on this part."
