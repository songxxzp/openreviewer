To compute the initial conditions for each image, a visual encoder is employed based on the original image. The paper extends the existing framework of FINOLA by making two key enhancements: generalizing it and relaxing the local constraints. These relaxations not only enhance the image reconstruction performance but also lead to the observation of specific phenomena under certain conditions within the representation. They performed rigorous experiments to gain understanding of this perspective."

The paper extends prior work of Chen et al., FINOLA, by interpreting their autoregressive process as the discretization of the one-way wave equation and by considering the sum of multiple such FINOLA solutions as an input to the decoder network. Numerical results illustrate that the reconstruction of the superposition of FINOLAs yields a significantly better PSNR than a single one, e.g., improving from 24.8 to 27.8."

In this sense, I found the paper very interesting to read."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "Unfortunately, I also see several weaknesses in the presented work.\n- Contribution: It is stated in section 2, that the prior work FINOLA is extended in two ways: a) generalizing FINOLA to a set of one-way wave equations and b) relaxing the local constraints. Yet, a) is merely an interpretation, and b) is done by summing over multiple FINOLA solutions. I consider this to be rather simple with the increase in PSNR being very natural due to the larger latent space of the resulting model. \n- Insights on whether wave equations are really a common joint principle in natural images: There is no comparison to other autoencoders, no motivation on why the wave equation could be of particular importance to images, and no illustration/interpretation of the latent space encodings $q_i$ or the corresponding solutions $z_i$ of the autoregressive FINOLA features. In particular, a $256 \\times 256 \\times 3$ color image is represented, e.g. with a $8 \\times 1024$ latent space variable and subsequently decoded (using the multi-path FINOLA) with a PSNR of 27.1. But how would approaches perform that use a latent space of similar dimension and do not exploit any autoregressive (or wave-equation-based) operation in their decoder? In order to believe that wave equations or FINOLA are a fundamental \"underlying mathematical property shared by images\", the proposed approach would have to perform significantly better than competing approaches. A truncated PCA, keeping the largest patch-wise DCT (or wavelet) coefficients of an image, and training a standard convolutional autoencoder would be natural very classical baselines. Currently, I am not convinced that multi-path FINOLA / wave equations are the fundamental ingredient that makes the autoencoder work exceptionally well."

The supplement compares to DCT and wavelet coding, but seemingly in terms of general aspects only, not in terms of reconstruction quality. \n- The cited work of FINOLA by Chen et al. does not have a journal, conference or ArXiv ID.
