                "value": "For the current submitted version, I vote a boardline accept score and below are my remaining concerns.\n\n(1) This paper proposes to achieve calibrated accracy from the perspective of group accuracy. However, it seems to me that intuitively, group accuracy is more coarse-grained than the accuracy of each individual. Thus, I am curious that, will this direction of group accuracy leads to a lower upper limit than the other branches of method?\n\n(2) Secondly, if I am not wrong, the logic of this paper's proof seems to be, (1) the proposed optimization algorithm can optimize over the upper bound of source group accuracy estimation error. (2) the source group accuracy estimation error serves as a upper bound of the target group accuracy estimation error. Thus, because of (1) and (2) one by one, the proposed optimization algorithm works. My question w.r.t. this is that, are your two upper bounds tight enough to make the thing theoretically meaningful? Taking Eq. 5 as an example, while I do not check the math very carefully, it seems that the target group accuracy estimation error is upper bounded by the source group accuracy estimation error multipled with both M and the other item in the bracket. Thus, both these two items, if large to a certain scale, while make the optimization over the upperbound sub-meaningful. I understand that the authors have discussed that they will tighten the bound by \"bound the maximum and minimum values of IW\". However, I think this part should be elaborated as the tightness of the bound is important from my perspective. Besides, I also appreciate if the other impacts of this \"bound the maximum and minimum values of IW\" operation can be discussed. For example, will this operation hurt the current theoretical flow?\n\n(3) The last small question I have is that, the authors claim in their conclusion that, applying their model on large language model does not get improvement. They thus conclude that, \"the pre-trained large-language model is less subject to the distribution shifts\". Can another potential reason behind this observation be that the proposed method is poorly scalable to larger models? I hope either discussion or experiments can be made on the scalability of the proposed method."

                "value": "**(-)** The contribution's novelty is limited. The paper employs importance weighting to simultaneously address both the model calibration and selection problems. However, similar works, such as (You et al., 2019) for model selection and (Wang et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020) for model calibration, have been previously published. The primary difference between this paper and previous works appears to be the introduction of bin-wise importance weighting, as proposed in (Park et al., 2022). In summary, this paper mainly replaces the use of importance weighting in prior works with a more recent advanced importance weighting technique.\n\n**(-)** The empirical evaluation is inadequate, rendering the conclusion less reliable. The paper only examines one UDA method, MDD, on a single UDA dataset, Office-Home, for assessing the proposed method, IW-GAE. This limited scope does not provide sufficient empirical evidence for the effectiveness of IW-GAE. It is recommended to expand the experiments to encompass more UDA methods and datasets, following relevant works (Wang et al., 2020; You et al., 2019). In conclusion, the paper lacks the necessary empirical support for IW-GAE.\n\n**(-)** The proposed method may not be effective and practical, significantly diminishing the paper's contribution. While the empirical evaluation in the main text demonstrates the effectiveness of IW-GAE with MDD, the evaluation in the appendix reveals that IW-GAE does not outperform TransCal (Wang et al., 2020) with CDAN. Moreover, IW-GAE is considerably more complex, as it involves multiple hyperparameters compared to the hyperparameter-free TransCal (Wang et al., 2020) and DEV (You et al., 2019). IW-GAE requires at least three sensitive hyperparameters to be configured: temperature, the number of accuracy groups, and the number of bins, which does not guarantee its suitability for the model selection problem. In conclusion, the current, albeit insufficient experiments suggest that IW-GAE is not competitive and practical when compared with existing solutions.\n\n**(-)** The paper's presentation lacks clarity due to weak organization and missing information, particularly when compared to the well-structured writing in two highly relevant importance-weighting works (Wang et al., 2020; You et al., 2019) in the context of UDA. The current submission includes excessive background and proofs while omitting essential details about the algorithm and empirical evaluations. Furthermore, the motivation and novelty of this paper in comparison to existing importance-weighting works on model calibration and model selection remain unclear."
