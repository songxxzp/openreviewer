                "value": "This work introduces an innovative algorithm designed to discover approximate state-covering behaviors in a task-agnostic manner for reinforcement learning agents. Building upon existing skill-learning techniques that use the mutual information between skills and states to learn distinguishable and state-covering skills, this work introduces a modification to the objective. The modification involves constraining the latent space of the skills to prioritize temporally compact representations. This novel approach ensures that the skills are estimated within a manifold preserving the temporal properties of the state space, allowing for maximization of spread-out trajectories over time. The incorporation of a metric, specifically temporal distance, grounds the latent space to be compact, distinguishing it from previous metric-agnostic alternatives relying solely on mutual information. The study employs a \"Wasserstein variant\" of the mutual information objective, adeptly modified to facilitate tractable optimization and online learning. One of the key advantages of pre-training RL agents using this objective lies in its scalability, enabling the learning of a compact skill space even from high-dimensional observations, such as images, where prior methods faced challenges in scalability. Moreover, when training a hierarchical controller to employ these learned skills, METRA demonstrates superior downstream task performance in previously unsolved benchmarks. In essence, the paper makes a significant contribution by introducing an effective new algorithm and strengthens its credibility by providing essential theoretical underpinnings for its design."

This work tackles a limitation inherent in the existing MI objective, which is metric-agnostic, and hence does not directly incentivize skills to maximize an explicit metric for state coverage. The proposed modification facilitates the operation of skills within a temporally compact space, wherein the maximization of diversity aligns with the adoption of state-covering behaviors. The incorporation of a well-defined theoretical formulation enhances the paper's credibility, providing a strong foundation for the proposed objective.\n\nThe key contribution of the proposed algorithm is its scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional observations - an ongoing challenge in the broader field of reinforcement learning. By addressing this limitation, the paper contributes significantly to the unsupervised RL domain. This work presents the development of an algorithm that stands as a substantial and impactful contribution to the field of unsupervised RL, and that is clearly theoretically justified."

Specifically, METRA's performance remains unclear in settings such as discrete control or, more significantly, in stochastic environments. An important aspect that is missing is a demonstration of how the temporally compact space learned by METRA enables reward-free pre-training in these challenging scenarios. Addressing these points would significantly enhance the paper's impact, making it a more substantial and comprehensive contribution to the field.\n\nThe paper iteratively simplifies the proposed objective to enable tractable optimization. However, it remains unclear if these modifications impact the performance of the algorithm. An ablation study of these could also provide insightful details of the proposed objective. (e.g. if training with the formulation that requires N rollouts for each latent, would the obtained skills be more diverse?)"

However, are there any other metrics that are promising for their applications to the reinforcement learning setting in the METRA framework?

Although this allows for non-linear policies in the state space, can the latter limit the diversity of the learned skills in other challenging environments? (e.g. stochastic, multi-agent). Could METRA be modified to model non-linear skills even in the latent space?"

If the vision encoders of all baselines are the same (a pretrained network), will the experiment results change?\n\n- Similar to the last question, will the proposed method still outperform if we only consider state-based tasks?
