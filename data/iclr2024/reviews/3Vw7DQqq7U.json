Vision Transformer is a pre-norm Transformer, and in BERT language modeling, the authors also used the pre-norm variant. Since the authors claimed compatibility of the algorithm with different variants, it would be better to see the experiments on different variants (at least a post-norm variant) to verify the claim. While in Appendix, the authors show lossless expansion for other variants, it is also important to evaluate the performance metrics. \n\n3. Since this work also studies the initialization of model parameters, it might be interesting to compare the proposed idea with other initialization approach, such as Mimetic initialization (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09828, also mentioned in the related work)"

Have the considered baselines for expansion in Section 6 been confirmed to be lossless? If not, it is necessary to present the gap with the original model. If they are indeed lossless, an analysis should be provided to explain why the proposed method achieves higher validation accuracy compared to AKI, which also breaks symmetry, as shown in Figure 8.\n3. The results in Table 2 are a bit confusing. It is unclear whether model expansion or longer training duration indeed contributes to the improved performance.\n4. The novelty of this paper seems quite limited. The key idea of model expansion seems a simple extension of net2net. Are there any essential technical differences?
