Unlike the typical conformal prediction setting that assumes that data satisfies the exchangeable assumption (i. e. any permutation of the data is equally likely), it tries to relax such assumption. Also, unlike the typical conformal prediction that provides a prediction set that's supposed to contain the true label, it studies a more general form usually referred to as conformal risk control.\n\nThe paper achieves the above goal by combining Barber et al. (Conformal Prediction Beyond Exchangeability) and Angelpoulos et al. (Conformal Risk Control). \n\nFinally, the paper tests the idea on three datasets."

Once one understand the idea behind conformal prediction (i.e. finding an (1-alpha) quantile of the conformal score in the calibration data set), the idea of conformal risk control follows pretty naturally (finding some alpha-cut off for some monotonic loss in the calibration data set). And hence, techniques known for conformal prediction can be easily translated to conformal risk control \u2014 i.e. handling distribution shift. In this specific case, the paper is leveraging the technique of conformal prediction beyond exchangeability. Also, there isn\u2019t inherent difficulty in applying the beyond the exchangeability idea to this conformal risk control setting to my knowledge. If there is additional difficulty in applying the beyond the exchangeability idea to the conformal risk control setting compared to applying the idea to the typical conformal prediction setting, it would be great if the authors can emphasize that and how this difficulty was overcome.  \n-There\u2019s no clear guideline as to how to go about setting these weights and one has to resort to heuristics.

Conformal risk control is a generalization of conformal prediction that expands control of coverage losses to control of any monotonic, upper-bounded, exchangeable function $L \\colon \\Lambda \\rightarrow [0, B]$, where $\\Lambda$ is the space of single-dimensional inputs to ${L}$. Most often ${L}$ is some deterministic function $\\mathcal{L}$ of a parametrized, conformal set $\\mathcal{C}(X; \\lambda)$ and the label $Y$ that obeys $\\lambda_1 \\leq \\lambda_2 \\implies \\mathcal{C}(X; \\lambda_1) \\subseteq \\mathcal{C}(X; \\lambda_2) \\implies \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{C}(X; \\lambda_1), Y) \\geq \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{C}(X; \\lambda_2), Y) $.\n\nAs the paper by Angelopoulos et. al. (2023) showed, conformal risk control is considerably more flexible than standard conformal prediction, while still retaining nearly identical guarantees. The work by Angelopoulos et. al. (2023) briefly touched on straightforward extensions to conformal risk control, including proving a bound on the degradation in guaranteed risk as a function of $\\sum TV(Z_i, Z_{n+1})$, where $Z_i = (X_i, Y_i)$, similar to the work of Barber et. al. (2022). This paper further includes the use of data _weight_ functions (as in Barber et. al. (2022)), and shows that this can have good empirical impact on several experimental domains.\n\n[1] Conformal Risk Control. Anastasios N.
