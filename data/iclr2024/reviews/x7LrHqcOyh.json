            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "* I find the story incoherent. Often this might be because the story is built around the computation budget, whereas the underlying story, in my opinion, is about out-of-distribution input size generalisation and using planning budget and memory increase for that. I think this leads to some unnecessary complications and breaks the flow of the argument, e.g. as with Section 5 resulting from 3.2.1. and having a two-page section in between.\n* Some of the important topics are glanced over whereas more relevant parts could have been explored in more details. For the readers, unfamiliar with DNCs, this paper would be hard to grasp. I think, more time should be spent on Section 2, including an illustration would greatly help. This can be done by reducing Section 3.1. to a single paragraph describing the general inspiration.\n* The paper is sometimes too loose when it comes to the results interpretation and some phrasings. I will put more details on this in the 'questions' subsection of the review, but here are some examples:\n  - Section 3.2 is called that 'adaptive planning budget improves generalisation'. Figure 1 shows that training with budget = n is better than training with budget = 10. However, we don't know what will happen when we train with n=20 which is fixed, but more than the original n=10. \n  - Section 3.2 proposes an explanation that is not scrutinised in the experimental section: \"Since the model was only allowed a constant planning budget during training, it was forced to find an average-case algorithm that can be efficiently run, and whose internal representation of the data can be efficiently written to and read out of memory.\" To clarify things, I find this hypothesis extremely interesting and worth exploring. But it has to be tested in some way.\n  - I find phrases like 'learning a more general algorithm' to be quite vague and misleading. Furthermore, in my opinion they make it much harder to read the paper as it would be if the reasoning was just about generalisation properties of the model. For example, instead of 'learning a more general algorithm' on can say 'generalise to a wider range of input sizes' or smth. I believe reasoning about the effect of a particular experiment from the perspective of out-of-distribution generalisation would be easier to interpret and reason about."

                "value": "I left some major suggestions in the 'weaknesses' section above. I will put concrete major questions below and will have a separate subsection for smaller comments/nits.\n\nMajor Qs:\n* Could you provide supporting evidence that adaptive planning budget improves generalisation and it's not just about the max number of steps the model was allowed to use during training? What if we pick the constant number of steps that is the upper bound on the number you used for the adaptive computation curve on Figure 1?\n* Could you explain the difference between your claim 1 and claim 2 stated in the intro? As far as I understand, claim 1 means \"adaptive planning budget -> better generalisation\", claim 2 means: \"adaptive planning budget -> better use of memory -> better generalisation\". Is claim 2 a more refined version of claim 1, or I'm missing something?\n* Do you think it's possible that Figure 4 result is an artefact of giving the model n planning steps during training? It would be extremely curious to see a similar line for the model trained with n/2 budget or 2n budget.\n* \"we [ ] empirically prove\", \"provide experimental proof\", \"this proves claim 2\": one cannot prove something empirically. We can empirically disprove a hypothesis, or provide some evidence supporting a hypothesis. But proving a hypothesis is impossible empirically. Please, rephrase.\n\nMinor Qs/comments:\n* I'm curious, why did you choose to work on DNCs instead of other alternatives (e.g. GNNs or transformers)?\n* Interestingly, for Figure 1b, the non-adaptive curve is higher than the adaptive one for n_edges>160. What do you think happened there?\n* Could you explain what 'model learns to perform the algorithm rather than describe it' mean?\n* nit: Figure 1 is easy to parse when reading from a black&white print out, Figures 2, 4 and 5 are impossible to parse. Maybe increasing the space between the dashes or adding other line markers might help?\n\n\n## Post rebuttal update\nI appreciate the authors addressing some of my claims and raise the score from 3 to 5. However, I still think the paper requires more work to be published at ICLR: story coherence, DNC exposition, new experiments seem to affect the 'adaptive computation -> generalisation' claim."

Moreover, this also means that such approaches cannot utilize additional memory effectively further limiting their generalization capabilities.\n\nTo show that adaptive planning strategies are necessary, the authors conduct an empirical evaluation on two graph problems: Shortest Path and MinCut. The authors propose a linear planning budget on the size of the input graph and show that DNCs training with such a planning budget are able to better generalize to graphs with larger sizes than seen during training. The authors also show that DNCs cannot learn generic algorithms if trained with a fixed budget and allowed a variable budget during inference.\n\nFinally, the authors also show that such adaptive models can also better utilize addtional memory whenever it is available and thus generalize to larger inputs more effectively."

                "value": "The main claim of the paper is that the DNC can only learn a generalizable algorithm because it is trained with a flexible planning budget. In other words, the paper claims that one cannot learn a generalizable algorithm with a DNC trained with fixed planning budget. To prove this, the paper compares a DNC trained with a fixed planning budget of 10 steps, to a DNC trained with a flexible budget, equivalent to the size of the input. In the experiments, both DNCs are trained on input graphs with up to 75 edges.\n\nI have two problems with this argumentation:\n\n1) the DNC with constant planning budget of 10 steps has much less computation available than the DNC with flexible planning budget, which uses up to 75 steps during training. At test time, the difference becomes even larger as we evaluate the DNCs on graphs with up to 200 edges. It does not seem fair to compare models with such different compute budgets.\n\n2) It may be that the fixed planning budget of 10 steps is simply too small to learn general algorithms. To prove the point that flexible planning budgets are required for learning generalizable algorithms, the authors should show that a baseline with a fixed planning budget **equivalent to the longest graphs** the model is evaluated on (i.e. 200 steps in the experiments) still fails to learn generalizable algorithms.\n\nFor the latter point, one could argue that it is impractical or wasteful to train with the max planning length even for small inputs. But still, the fixed planning budget should be set in a way that it matches the compute flops used for the flexible planning model during training. It is unclear how the current value of 10 was chosen and it seems to result in a baseline that has overall less compute and thus an unfair comparison.\n\nThe same argument holds true for the \"increased memory utilization\" experiments.\n\nA separate concern is the stability of the proposed approach. The results in appendix C suggest that the models' generalization capability heavily varies between different seeds. This is concerning since the model presented in section C does not exhibit the central generalization capabilities that the paper claims.\n\nFinally, the paper uses the simple heuristic of setting the number of planning steps to be equivalent to the length of the input. This is an arbitrary choice that may not generalize well to other tasks and may require hand-tuning on any new task family."

The authors devote a lot of room for additional experiments that aim to investigate how adaptive processing time improves extrapolation. They also present interesting results on how extrapolation to a large amount of memory can benefit from an adaptive processing time which appears to have been a long-standing issue in DNC extensions."

                "value": "The contributions of the paper concern shortcomings of the DNC, which, at least to my knowledge, has not gained a strong foothold in learning general algorithms from data. While it's refreshing to see non-LLM submissions, I'm afraid that the paper at hand might not be of high interest to the community at the moment.\n\nThe paper is built around two claims (adaptive planning budget during training leads to learning more general algorithms, and adaptive planning budget allows for memory usage that generalizes better) that are marked as important and general insights, whereas they require 1-2 paragraphs regarding the specific settings they apply to. I would like it better if the formatting would be tuned down a bit given the experimental evidence.\n\nFor claim 1, I do not see how the paper supports clearly demonstrates how an adaptive planning budget generalizes to larger inputs in the general case. While the idea in itself makes sense and does work better on shortest path, there's no significant benefit on min-cut (the authors give a good explanation why that's the case, but in the end there's no evidence for the claim on this problem). More importantly, there is no baseline taking, let's say, a fixed amount of 100 planning steps instead of 10. The claim also seems to leave out the part where, with an adaptive planning budget, the model appears to perform worse on short inputs. Lastly, the claim focuses on using adaptive processing time during training, whereas it seems to required during testing as well (and that's not mentioned in the claim).\n\nFor claim 2, I found the formulation a bit ambiguous. What do you mean with \"use its memory addresses in a more general way\"? I also don't think there's enough evidence to support this claim, assuming it means that the resulting model can benefit from increasing the memory size at inference time. In contrast to what the authors write in the last paragraph of section 5, the memory reweighting scheme  also benefits the DNC with a fixed amount of processing steps (Fig 5a); this should become clear if the figure is being zoomed in. To me it seems like we see similar improvements, relatively speaking, for fixed and adaptive planning budgets. \n\nIn summary, my view is that (1) the paper concerns a topic of marginal interest; and (2) the claims as they are made to be are not sufficiently supported by the evidence that's presented."

                "value": "I was wondering why the fact that the DNC is already taking an adaptive number of steps based on the problem size is not discussed? What is the sensitivity of the DNC to the amount of processing steps in general? Is 10 just a good number for the problem sizes considered in the original paper?\n\nRegarding the requirement for quadratic processing time on min-cut: have you considered training and testing on smaller instances of the problem instead?\n\nPlease fix the citations so that braces are used when they occur in text but are not part of a sentence."
