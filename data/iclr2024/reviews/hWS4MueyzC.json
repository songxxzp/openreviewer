The paper presents a tough benchmark that tests current systems on their ability to reason about free-form concepts in a few-shot manner by identifying the common concept in a positive set and distinguishing it from the negative set. \n\nThe paper introduces a robust benchmark that assesses systems' ability to perform few-shot reasoning on free-form concepts. It challenges models to identify commonalities in positive sets while distinguishing them from negative sets, enhanced by the inclusion of distractors and hard negatives in the dataset curation process. The evaluation framework covers a wide spectrum, encompassing four distinct approaches: few-shot learning, combined LLM+VLM in single and multiple steps, and a novel neuro-symbolic architecture.\n\nThe evaluation setup utilized in the paper is comprehensive and includes the evaluation of four different kinds of approaches that include a few shot learning approaches, LLM+VLM in a single step, LLM+VLM in multiple iteration steps, and finally a proposed neuro-symbolic architecture."

VLM-based approaches, like GPT4(V), that directly take images as input and can be prompted to obtain the desired input, could be used to identify the relevant concept from a collage of images given together. Since current VLM/LLM approaches are very susceptible to the way they are prompted, it is very important to prompt engineer them in a number of ways and then identify the best working one."

                "value": "- The presentation and writing could be clearer, making some parts of the paper difficult to understand, especially around the creation of the dataset in Sec. 2 and the precise problem setting. For example, it was not immediately clear that the labels of the two sets (positive, negative) are given and do not need to be inferred. The query image can belong to either, but the name \"positive\" suggests that this is the GT set of the query image, which is not the case. I am adding more clarifying questions in the questions section below.\n- The problem setting is imbalanced. The positive set corresponds to a single concept while the negative set does not, but instead contains a subset of the complete concept. While this is not necessarily an issue and can be a design choice, there is no justification why this choice has been made. For instance, why not have both sets correspond to a single concept where the contrasting sets are close in semantics to make it a hard problem? Similarly to how different splits are evaluated in Table 2, it would have helped to show the performance of positive query images vs. negative query images in order to understand if this imbalance makes positive/negative queries easier/harder.\n- While a lot of models have been evaluated on the proposed benchmark, a natural baseline is missing: computing the image similarity between the query image and the two sets. For instance, one can use any pre-trained image encoder (CLIP, Dino, etc.) or image-to-image retrieval method and use the mean similarly of the image embeddings per set to make a prediction. Using captioning models and LLMs seems to introduce complexity while at the same time discarding fine-grained image information by only relying on text to make the decision.\n- With around 1K tasks it is a rather small dataset. Hence, focusing on the \"zero-shot\" setting without involving training might be the better use case.\n- While it is true that the benchmark contains a large variety of concepts, positioning it heavily as an \"open-world\" and \"open-vocabulary\" task could be a bit misleading as the core problem is to identify whether an image came from set A or set B. The optional task of naming the concept is most fitting for \"open-world\", but it serves a minor role in the paper."

                "value": "- Have you thought about not providing the labels \"positive\" and \"negative\" for the two sets to the methods? Why have you chosen this setup?\n- In Sec 2.1: What is a grid in this context? What is grid sampling? How do you define \"concept tuples\"? Neither the main paper, nor the supplementary clarifies this sufficiently.\n- How do you ensure that the dataset does not contain duplicate concepts? I assume this is the case because in Table 1, it is reported that the dataset has 1.01K concepts and 1.01K tasks.\n- What are the exact instructions the annotators were given? For instance, when \"annotators are instructed to write visual concepts by following a predefined set of categories illustrated in Table 7\" and when \"they are also asked to combine these challenging concepts with those mined from CC-3M\" (Sec. 2.1).\n- Images are collected by using an online search based on the concepts. What is the license of the images collected? Do the authors have the rights to distribute the images?\n- In Sec. 2.2. you write: \"the annotators are then asked to provide two sets of candidates for positive and negative queries\". How many images are collected here for possible query images? Why choose only one positive and negative image as query in the end?\n- Does defining the concepts of category 0 (from CC3M) undergo any crowd-sourcing or is it fully automated?\n- Is there performance difference between positive and negative queries?\n- In Figure 2c, both x and y-axis should be labeled. What is the scale/size of the number of concepts (x-axis)? What is the unit of the numbers on the y-axis?\n- What is meant by \"we report the overall accuracy of all models\". Does Table 2 report test set accuracy or accuracy over the whole dataset, i.e., including training samples?\n- Why are concepts from CC3M considered non-commonsense?\n- How is ChatGPT finetuned (Table 2)? Does this use the finetuning API of OpenAI? More details would help make this more reproducible.\n\nComments/suggestions:\n- Table 2 includes methods that use training data to update NN weights and others that do not update weights (\"zero-shot\" setting). It would be much clearer if the table indicates which models use training data.\n- The following phrase appears 3 times in the manuscript. I suggest to to reduce this repetition and rephrase it according to the context. \"We even designed a neuro-symbolic reasoning approach that reconciles LLMs & VLMs with logical reasoning to emulate the human problem-solving process for Bongard problems\".\n- Sec. 3.2 (at the end) promises captioning metrics, but they do not appear in the main paper, only in the supplementary.\n- The formatting of Table 7 is confusing. It would be better to clearly separate the left half from the right half, or simply just make it 10 rows."

Specifically, a Bongard problem contains a set of \u2018positive\u2019 and \u2018negative\u2019 images in the support set, where the positives all share a concept that none of the negatives do. The goal is to use this \u2018context\u2019 to infer the positive \u2018concept\u2019 in order to correctly label a disjoint set of query images as being positive or negative. While this problem has been studied in previous work, the proposed benchmark differs in that the concepts are \u2018open world\u2019 (rather than selected from a predefined small set). Specifically, they leverage Conceptual Concepts which is a massive web-crawled dataset containing image descriptions, and extract concepts from that dataset as well as through crowd-sourcing, to obtain concepts that contain factual or commonsense knowledge. Then, an image search tool is used to find appropriate images from the web to populate the \u2018positives\u2019 and \u2018negatives\u2019 for each concept (as well as query images) in order to form Bongard problems. They conduct an empirical investigation using both canonical few-shot learning methods as well as leveraging LMs and VLMs in different ways. For example, they explore a scenario where the VLM produces a caption for each of the images in the support set, and then these captions along with the positive and negative labels are fed to the LM which makes a prediction for each query image via in-context learning. This can be done in one-go or iteratively. They also propose a symbolic approach that directly applies logical operations to infer the positive concept."

They also created tasks using natural (\u2018real-world\u2019) images from different datasets, from using computer vision datasets (rather than scraping the web).\n\n- It would be great to add additional few-shot learning baselines to cover families of approaches that are excluded from the current analysis like approaches that perform FiLM-conditioning e.g. [B, C] (see references below) and approaches that train the backbone with gradient descent within each task, like MAML and Proto-MAML (the latter is a version proposed in the Meta-Dataset paper which is cited by this work)\n\n- The paper has some clarity issues, perhaps owing to the fact that the authors tried to \u2018squeeze\u2019 a lot of content in the required number of pages. It\u2019s hard to fully understand the different methods by reading only the main paper. I found the neuro-symbolic method proposed especially hard to understand (even after looking at the algorithm in the appendix). Please include some higher-level motivation and the intuition for the particular updates that it entails.\n\n- In Table 2, it\u2019s hard to tell which methods / rows correspond to which of the families of approaches (e.g. a, b, c, or d in Figure 3) \u2013 and e.g. which are single-round or multi-round. Perhaps a good way of indicating this is by adding an extra column in that table.\n\n- It would be great to conduct ablation analyses for design choices made in creating the benchmark, like the adversarial query selection that picks the positive query to not be too close to the prototype of the positive class. \n\n- It would be great to conduct an analysis of the effect of the \u2018shot\u2019 on these problems. Intuitively, the more positive and negative images the network sees, the easier it is to infer what is the positive class and correctly label query images. Given the negative results in the paper with the current number of shots (6 positives and 6 negatives), in terms of the very large gap from human performance, have the authors considered increasing the number of shots? Understanding how performance of different methods differs as the number of shots increases would be insightful.\n\n- it would also strengthen the paper to tie in the findings of this work with findings in related works. E.g. in the Bongard-HOI benchmark that the authors claim is the most similar, do they have similar findings e.g. in terms of which methods perform better?\n\n\nMinor\n=====\n- \u2018given 6 positive and 6 negative images [...] (see Figure 1 for illustration)\u2019 \u2013 but Figure 1 shows only 3 positive and 3 negative images (6 in total, not each). Maybe clarify that Figure 1 doesn\u2019t correspond to that setting and is used for illustration only? Or describe the task in the intro at a higher level of abstraction, e.g. P positive and N negative images.\n- in the caption of Figure 1, highlight \u2018hard negatives\u2019 in orange, like \u2018distractors\u2019 are highlighted in green, to match the (captions of the) images shown in that figure.\n- typo: \u201cprob\u201d \u2192 \u201cprobe\u201d (on page 6)\n- typo: \u201cwas not fine-tuning\u201d \u2192 \u201cwas not fine-tuned\u201d (in Table 2\u2019s caption)\n\nReferences\n=========\n\n- [A] Probing Few-Shot Generalization with Attributes.

                "value": "- In Table 1, how is the number of tasks computed? What constitutes a unique task? Would having the same set of classes but different images in the support set count as the same task?\n\n- In Fig 3a, different few-shot learning algorithms are shown for the classification head only which seemed surprising. Some of these are meta-learning methods that also update the backbone. Is there a meta-training phase (starting possibly from a pretrained architecture) during which the backbone is also finetuned?\n\n- the authors mention that all few-shot learners excluding ChatGPT and GPT-4 use a ConvNext-base. But they also mention that SNAIL uses a transformer architecture. Should SNAIL be listed as another exception there?\n\n- The authors claim that open vocabulary is important for this benchmark and they use this as a  justification for the fact that pretraining on larger datasets leads to better results (\u201cfew-shot learners fueled with proper open-ended pretrained models [...] can alleviate this gap\u201d). But an alternative explanation could be that such large pretrained models like CLIP have already seen the specific images and / or concepts presented in the few-shot learning task and thus they simply face a weaker generalization challenge compared to models that were trained on smaller training set which may have a smaller probability of having seen these exact images or concepts. Have the authors made an attempt to examine or rule out this alternative hypothesis?  \n\n- Is it possible that some of the created Bongard problems are not solvable? E.g. this could happen if there accidentally is more than one concept that is shared between all of the positive images and none of the negative images. Is care taken to avoid this?"
