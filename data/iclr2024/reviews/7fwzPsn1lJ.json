The model's architecture is constructed by harnessing the power of the jukebox audio encoder and the Llama 2 text encoder. To create the training data, ChatGPT (or GPT-4) is employed to generate instructional texts based on music track metadata, encompassing information such as BPM, genre, chord progression, and key signature. This comprehensive model offers thorough analysis and understanding of music inputs. The authors showcase the impressive capabilities of their model, named 'Llark,' by demonstrating its high performance across a wide range of music-related tasks, including music genre classification, key signature classification, tempo estimation, and music captioning. Furthermore, the authors have dedicated a substantial portion of the appendix to provide in-depth insights into their experimental results and the data generation process."

                "value": "The proposed LLark model stands out as a tool for tackling a wide array of music understanding and retrieval tasks. Notably, the realm of cross-modality models, particularly those bridging language and music, has remained relatively under-explored. The majority of existing models have primarily concentrated on text-image and general audio-text associations, leaving a gap in the field. This paper marks an initialization in the direction of language-based music understanding, utilizing LLM. The selection of music-related tasks employed to evaluate the capabilities of the LLark model is logical and well-founded."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "However, there are several notable shortcomings in this paper concerning its overall motivation, technical novelty, and experimental design, which diminish its quality and hinder its acceptance at the ICLR conference.\n\nFirst, the assertion that LLark serves as a foundational music model is overstated. Upon closer examination, LLark emerges as a language-based audio understanding model, enriched with music instruction-based data. It lacks significant technical novelty for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The audio encoder (Jukebox) and text encoder (Llama 2) employed in LLark were introduced in previous works, and their training primarily relied on large-scale data pre-training. Consequently, the paper doesn't place substantial emphasis on advancing the early-stage representation learning of both audio and language models.\n\n(2) The model architecture itself, present in both encoders, exhibits no novel adaptations to better suit the domains of music understanding or language comprehension.\n\n(3) The instruction-based data generation process, while employed effectively, has been previously explored in various machine learning domains, including audio, as demonstrated by works such as LAION-CLAP [1] and WavCaps [2]. The method used for prompt creation in this paper does not introduce particularly novel design elements, potentially falling short of the requisite technical novelty standards for ICLR.\n\nConsequently, apart from LLark's exploration of LLM's potential applications in the context of music as a sub-category of the audio modality, both the audio and text encoders, as well as the data creation approach, lack substantial innovation. It appears to be more of a fusion of pre-existing works rather than a meticulously designed contribution to the field of music understanding.\n\nAdditionally, LLark's design, which is more of a combination of existing components than a novel creation, results in a limitation. It primarily excels at simple classification-based and language-generation tasks, thus falling short of being a comprehensive music foundation model capable of addressing diverse aspects of music content, such as music source separation and music generation. Consequently, labeling LLark as a music foundation model appears somewhat overambitious, as a language-output-only model does not meet the criteria for such a designation.\n\nThis limitation exposes a second weakness. If LLark were indeed a potent model capable of unifying various music understanding tasks, it would represent a significant breakthrough, offering a one-stop solution for music classification, understanding, and captioning. However, LLark does not meet these expectations. Based on my extensive knowledge of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) development, LLark lags behind state-of-the-art models in several MIR subtasks, and even falls short of other music understanding models, such as MERT [3]. Here are some pertinent statistics:\n\n(1) In genre classification on GTZAN, the current state-of-the-art [4] achieves an accuracy of 83.5%, while MERT, a music understanding model without a language component, achieves around 79.3%. In contrast, LLark only achieves 56%, which falls significantly short of practical usability standards.\n\n(2) For key-signature classification on GiantStep, the current state-of-the-art model [3] achieves 74.3% accuracy, whereas LLark attains 70%.\n\n(3) In tempo estimation on GiantStep, the current state-of-the-art model [5] reaches an accuracy of 88.6%, while LLark achieves 86%.\n\nRemarkably, LLark does not exhibit superior performance despite leveraging two large models, Jukebox-5b and Llama2-7B. It's worth noting that these state-of-the-art models often have parameter sizes of less than 100 million or even 1-5 million. MERT, a Hubert-based music understanding model, effectively achieves equal or superior performance with a parameter size ranging from 95 million to 330 million, employing straightforward linear modules. Furthermore, models like MERT, CLAP, and others can extend their capabilities to encompass broader applications, such as music separation and text-to-music generation tasks. Thus, introducing a language model with billions of parameters that delivers fewer tasks and less performance seems counterintuitive. Moreover, comparing LLark with language-audio (LU-AST) or language-image (IB-LLM) models is not comprehensive, as they are trained on different datasets and do not primarily focus on music data. Additionally, these models, in my view, are also far from achieving state-of-the-art performance to demonstrate practical usability\n\nIt is important to highlight that LLark's inference setting may not be as rigorously defined as proposed. The instruction-based data generation method provides the model with pre-structured slots for various music elements, such as genre, tempo, instrument, and chord. In this setup, it is expected that LLark can generate outputs corresponding to these slots when prompted with questions. Consequently, it may not truly qualify as a zero-shot setting.\n\nRegarding music captioning, while LLark's performance in this aspect demonstrates the power of language models, it is arguable whether this achievement is solely attributed to LLark or whether it mainly leverages the adaptation learned within Llama 2. Furthermore, when it comes to evaluation metrics, such as BLEU scores, LLark does not consistently outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches.\n\nThird, the motivation behind incorporating a language model within a music foundation model remains somewhat unclear. While LLM represents a remarkable advance in AI, the necessity of using a language model to answer questions about music attributes like tempo, key signature, chord estimation, or genre is a matter of debate. Such an interface may be more welcome when provided with labels or temporal markers, rather than a language-based query. Although music captioning demonstrates the potential, it is not fully explored in this paper. To harness the full potential of LLM in music understanding, it is crucial to either prove that language can serve as an effective tool or instruction for new music tasks (e.g., text-to-music generation, text-guided separation) or show that LLark can learn more from limited instruction-based data. However, this aspect remains unaddressed in the paper, as it is evident that LLark's performance relies heavily on specific instruction texts, and it may struggle to comprehend music without those explicit cues.\n\nIn summary, LLark appears to lack the necessary level of technical novelty in designing new architectures for a music foundation model, does not provide comprehensive evidence to establish itself as a complete music foundation model, and fails to demonstrate superior performance or conduct exhaustive comparisons against established Music Information Retrieval (MIR) state-of-the-art models or other music understanding approaches. As such, it may not meet the standards expected for acceptance at the ICLR conference, and more substantial evidence is required to demonstrate its functionality and efficiency\n\n[1] Large-scale Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining with Feature Fusion and Keyword-to-Caption Augmentation, ICASSP 2023\n\n[2] WavCaps: A ChatGPT-Assisted Weakly-Labelled Audio Captioning Dataset for Audio-Language Multimodal Research, Arxiv\n\n[3] MERT: Acoustic Music Understanding Model with Large-Scale Self-supervised Training, Arxiv\n\n[4] Masked Modeling Duo: Learning Representations by Encouraging Both Networks to Model the Input, ICASSP 2023\n\n[5] MAP-Music2Vec: A Simple and Effective Baseline for Self-Supervised Music Audio Representation Learning, ISMIR 2022"

Additionally, there seems to be a reference error related to LAION-CLAP; it should refer to [1] instead of [2].\n\n2. Do you have any experimental results for LLark on tasks related to temporal aspects, such as chord estimation or beat tracking? Including such results could enhance the paper's overall demonstration of LLark's performance and its ability to adapt to a wider range of Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks.\n\n3. On the demo page, there appears to be an issue with the music captioning demo. Specifically, I observed that Beethoven's captioning has three identical captions.

That sense of authority and confusion is less of a problem with the pre-LLM baseline models. I understand that this kind of evaluation may be out of scope for this paper, and there\u2019s room for critical follow-up work once the model is made open-source - But I can examples of this happening immediately in the online supplement, and I think it\u2019s worth at least highlighting these kinds of things in the paper.  For example:\n\n -   under \u201cHow could a music producer recreate the sounds in this track? \u2014> they would likely use a variety of synthesizers, both digital and analog\u201d - that\u2019s typical LLM word-salad stuff that in some cases seems harmless, but it\u2019s super misleading! You definitely don\u2019t need to go out and buy a bunch of analog synthesizers to produce that kind of track. \n\n- \u201cWhat are some characteristics that potentially differentiate the song from other similar songs \u2014> the use of the synthesizer as the main instrument\u2026Additionally, the song's tempo of 120 BPM and the use of the E minor key\u2026 gives the song its own unique identity within the electronic genre\u201d This is all nonsense - pretty much every song in the electronic genre features the synthesiser, 120 bpm is the least distinctive tempo you can choose, and E minor is a very typical key!"

                "value": "1.\tWhy does the dataset contain 1.2M text samples and only 164K audio clips, despite there being only three types of tasks?\n\n2.\tIs LLark limited by the upper bounds of the MIR model's performance used for metadata augmentation, and if so, how does this limitation impact its performance?\n\n3.\tIn Figure 4, all models seem to have low performance. Is it possible that the performance of baselines is lower than random guessing?\n\n4.\tSection 6.2 suggests that the improved genre performance of ImageBind-LLM [10] is attributed to genre tags used in pre-training. However, according to my knowledge, ImageBind [11] is trained on image-related pairs only, and there are no audio-text pairs used during pre-training. Why are genre tags relevant in this context?\n\n5.\tHow many raters were involved in the human evaluations for captioning and reasoning tasks?\n\n[10] Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang, Wenqi Shao, Peng Gao, Peng Xu, Han Xiao, Kaipeng Zhang, Chris Liu, Song Wen, Ziyu Guo, et al.

A learned mapping of the audio encoder output to the embedding space of the language encoder is introduced. A learned output language decoder is also learned. All of this is trained by optimising a loss on (audio in, text in, text out) triples. These training triples are constructed with an LLM + some ad hoc filtering steps, and are basically q & a \"what sort of song is this\" etc.\n\nThe pieces are well known and this is largely an empirical study. The results are promising and the paper is easy to read."
