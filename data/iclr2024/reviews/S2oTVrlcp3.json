Recent publications have each come up with their own ways of interfacing with environments and defining new tasks, and it is impossible to tell which agents are \"more capable\" than others. This work is a clear stepping-stone in defining standardized sets across different domains.\n\n### Originality\n\nVery original, no other exhaustive benchmarks in this domain exist.\n\n### Quality\n\nModerate to high quality. The benchmark is exhaustive in terms of different environments and challanges included, as well as conducting basic baselines. However some details and potentially expected benchmarks are missing (see weaknesses).\n\n### Clarity\n\nPaper is well structured and easy to read for the most part.\n\n### Significance\n\nThis paper, and the benchmark, can be important motivators and stepping stones for people to create comparable results between different LLM agent solutions. While I do not expect this to become de-facto way of measuring agent performance, I believe it will serve as a fixed benchmark, and in future people can improve upon it when needed. I believe this is a very significant contribution for ICLR readers."

Are users allowed to change the environment? Can users change the prompt manually before feeding to the agent?)\n\nDetails/motivation of the different capabilities is missing (see questions). I feel this need to be clarified and carefully motivated for a solid case why these capabilities matter and how they are properly measured.\n\nOther important details (e.g., human baseline collection) are missing. See questions.\n\n### (Minor) Missing baselines/experiments\n\nWhile having a fixed, single way of defining prompts makes the benchmark fixed and results comparable across models, I think there should be an option to try different techniques of prompting the models. E.g., chain-of-thought [1] can, with simple modifications to the prompt, improve results in LLM space (see questions)."

                "value": "1) How were numbers for the spider plots in Figure 2 came up with? On left it shows three degrees for every capability, but it is not obvious if it directly maps to different levels in the spider plot. If numbers on spider plot should reflect these three levels, I'd recommend adding the labels to the spider plots so reader knows to connect the two. Additionally Table 3 in the Appendix has four degrees for some of the capabilities (e.g., long text understanding), but this is not shown in Figure 2. Is this to save space or an oversight? If anyway possible, I'd recommend keeping the two consistent to avoid confusion.\n2) How were the capabilities chosen, and how would you exactly define their different degrees and their importance to the LLM research? By reading the paper, it seems they stem from the environments you chose, but they still come out as somewhat vague (e.g., what is \"Randomness\", exactly? Randomness in what? What is \"Reasoning with object dependencies\"? What is \"rollback\" error handling?). A valuable contribution would be to add as exact definitions as you can come up with, and detail them in a new section of the paper. The choice of your games helps you keep grounded to what can be measured, and by defining the metrics accuratelly, other researchers can bring new environments / dimensions into the mix.\n3) Likewise, can you provide exact details on the environments used in your benchmark package? While the code will allow exact reproduction, it might get updated as it lives on Github, so having a one solid description of the originally proposed setup would be beneficial.\n4) Have you experiment with ways to improve model performance by, e.g., chain-of-thought [1] prompting? These seem to improve models' performance across different tasks, and I feel this should be supported by this benchmark. E.g., you could add a flag or mutator or wrapper to your environment that adds/modifies the instructions/observations. Seeing initial results with these would strengthen the paper, but not necessary; my core request is to think these possibilities and also support them.\n5) How was the \"human baseline\" obtained, exactly? Did they play the games through the same exact API as the LLMs play (i.e., via text)? Were they familiar with the environments beforehand? Were there multiple human players? Likewise, how was the zero value defined in Table 2? Was it a random agent or literal 0 value for the score?\n\nReferences:\n- [1] Jason Wei, *et al*.

These games collectively offer up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations.\n3. **Capability Assessment**: Each game in SmartPlay is designed to challenge a subset of 9 crucial capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent. These capabilities include reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness.\n4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Through the diverse set of games and challenges, SmartPlay aims to provide a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs\u2019 abilities as agents."

                "value": "1. **concerns on fairness for different LLM**: The author solely relied on a pre-trained LLM for evaluation in these environments. However, since various language models are trained on different corpora and some remain undisclosed (such as close-source OpenAI language models), it becomes challenging to ascertain whether the LLM has been exposed to these specific environments. For instance, GPT possesses extensive knowledge of Minecraft, whereas LLAMA has relatively limited knowledge in this area. Consequently, ensuring fairness in direct comparisons of evaluations becomes difficult. To address this issue, I recommend that the author gather sufficient data for each environment and evaluate the capabilities of different language models separately using zero-shot learning, few-shot in-context learning, and instruction tuning approaches.\n2. **concerns on 3d spatial reasoning performance of LLM**: I noticed that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning in environments like Minecraft. This could be due to the lack of visual information in their training data, making it difficult to directly apply LLMs to tasks in this dataset. The author attempted to describe visual images using text, but previous experiments have shown this approach to be impractical. Additionally, the source of these visual descriptions was not explained by the author. Can models like LLaVA, GPT-4V, and Flamingo overcome these challenges by being fine-tuned with visual images and other relevant information?\n3. **concerns on difficulty computation**: The setting of difficulty for each game seems quite arbitrary. How are these difficulties determined? Are they based on human evaluation? I suggest the author provide clear explanations regarding this.\n4. **concerns on prompt design for different llms**: Despite instruction tuning, the performance of LLM still relies on prompt design. It is best to conduct explicit experiments and explanations on prompt design."

For instance, Minecraft offers an open world with numerous engaging tasks that require long-term planning and learning from interactions. However, the author only utilized Minecraft to evaluate the LLM agent's 3D spatial reasoning skills. Another convenient and popular option is a readily installable simulator package that is user-friendly.\n2. **Comparison with Existing Benchmarks**: The paper could be strengthened by comparing SmartPlay\u2019s performance and effectiveness in evaluating LLMs against existing benchmarks or evaluation methodologies, if any are available.\n3.

                "value": "1, Evaluation metrics proposed in the paper are commonly used in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL). While these metrics are established and provide a common ground for comparison, they may not be entirely suited to capture the unique nuances of planning and reasoning that are specific to LLMs functioning as agents. The paper could be strengthened by proposing or developing novel metrics that are tailored to the particular dynamics of LLMs' operational framework, offering a more precise measurement of their planning, reasoning, and adaptability skills in agent-based scenarios.\n\n2, Is it possible to craft the prompt to show the flow of reasoning and planning when LLMs as agents play the games?"
