Existing exemplar-free CIL algorithms incrementally trains new local experts on new tasks, and SEED provides a task selection technique to diversify trained experts, mitigate forgetting, and maintain plasticity. Specifically, an expert is a Bayes classifier that targets a distinct set of classes, with each class corresponding to a Gaussian distribution. To diversify expert selection, the next task is selected via the highest KL-divergence from encountered distributions. Inference is done by averaging the logits output from each expert and selecting the class with highest probability."

Overhead growth: one biggest disadvantage of architecture expansion is that the memory overhead grows linearly with respect to the number of tasks. That is, it needs K experts for K tasks with nothing reusable. SEED omits the selection procedure to decide the number of experts needed even if the number of tasks is large. This is not scalable in continual learning, where the number of tasks can be unbounded."

Thus, it is difficult to judge if the gains come from the proposed method or from the additional complexities.\n\n## Major concern - conceptual drawback of SEED\n- SEED implies that the number of experts should be smaller than the number of tasks and there is only one expert activated per task. Thus, it is inevitably that some experts will be reused in the future, leading to catastrophic forgetting especially when the tasks are conflicting. The use of LwF regularization might not be helpful if the expert stay inactive for a long period. \nTogether with with the ambiguity in the experimental settings and results, the contribution of this work seems marginal.\n\n## Minor concern \n- Additional baselines: A recent related method [A] that seems to outperforms SEED should be discussed.\n- There are two different references for CoSCL in the Introduction.\n\n[A] Ardywibowo, Randy, et al. \"VariGrow: Variational Architecture Growing for Task-Agnostic Continual Learning based on Bayesian Novelty.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.
