To achieves this, the authors select a set of evaluation metric that reflects the quality of generation as constraints and then find the optimal solution to the optimization problem. The authors evaluate their method on a bunch of tasks and report performance in several metrics. According to the results, the proposed method achieves better performance than other decoding strategies such as Greedy, Top-k, and Nucleus decoding."

Essentially, samples from a model are reweighted according to the degree to which they satisfy particular constraints, where the importance of these different constraints is learned via numerical optimization using a small set of samples. These constraints are that the texts generated by the model match human-generated texts according to a variety of chosen metrics. In order to sample from the new (sequence-level) distribution, they make use of a sampling based approximation of the distribution over continuations (of a particular prefix). They show strong results in terms of empirical performance in comparison to standard baseline decoding methods."

Similar language is scattered across 2.1\n* The method requires sampling in order to approximate the new parametric distribution (via the WIS algorithm). The runtime of this algorithm, and hence the additional computational complexity incurred by this decoding method, is not discussed. Further, there is an additional sampling + renormalization step that must happen during decoding (algorithm 2). The lack of discussion of these costs is especially pertinent given that the authors point to the tuning required by other decoding methods as one of their downsides \u201cBut unlike those previous decoding methods that require heavy manual hyper-parameter tuning for trade-off among different metrics\u201d"

Could some intuition be provided here?\n* \u201cMost existing decoding algorithms lead to deteriorated \u03b5-perplexity, comparing to directly sampling from the input LM distribution.\u201d It seems that [1] shows otherwise \n* In 2.2, I don\u2019t see why \u201cthe second result reveals the perplexity improvement over p\u03b8 due to the non-negativity of DKL(p\u03b8,\u03bc || p\u03b8)\u201d\n* The setup for human evaluation is not well explained. What do the numbers in table 3 mean?\n* I do not follow the last statement on page 5 \u201c...so that it can be directly plugged into Eq.
