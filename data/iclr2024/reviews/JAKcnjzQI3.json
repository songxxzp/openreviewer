The paper introduces an interesting concept in Theorem 3.1, highlighting the importance of mutual information constraints 'm' and 'n' in the context of privacy and utility trade-offs. However, it is essential to note that the experiments lack a corresponding exploration of these constraints. These constraints likely play a pivotal role in balancing sensitive attribute accuracy and useful attribute accuracy. The reported experimental results suggest that MaSS might not simultaneously achieve the best performance for both types of attributes. Therefore, it is recommended to conduct experiments with varying constraints to gain a deeper understanding of their impact.\n\n2. The theoretical argument presented in Theorem 3.2 may raise some questions. Specifically, the relevance of unannotated useful attributes to the tasks is highlighted, which could vary across different scenarios. The paper should address this issue and provide an ablation study of the contrastive learning module to support the claims made in Theorem 3.2. This would provide stronger evidence and clarity regarding the relationship between learned attributes and sensitive attributes.\n\n3. Clarification is needed on how the positive and negative samples for the InfoNCE loss are determined. Figure 3 suggests that both positive and negative samples come from the transformed data X', but the paper should explain how these samples are chosen, given that the anchor sample is the original data X.\n\n4. Regarding the evaluation of sensitive attribute accuracy, it appears that the accuracy of the adversarial classifier is used. It is recommended to consider the approach of training a classifier from scratch on the transformed data, similar to the methodology employed for calculating useful attribute accuracy.\n\n5. To provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method, the paper should include comparisons with recent baselines, such as SPAct (CVPR 2022 [1]).\n\n6. The topic of concept removal for generative models, while not a central focus, could be related to this paper's context. It is suggested to discuss concept removal in the related works section to provide a broader perspective on the field and to highlight the paper's contributions in relation to existing research.\n\n[1] Dave, Ishan Rajendrakumar, Chen Chen, and Mubarak Shah. \"Spact: Self-supervised privacy preservation for action recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 2022."

The main contribution of the paper seems to be in its proposal to preserve of *unannotated* features using a self-supervised-learning objective yet this idea of maximising $\\mathcal{I}(X; \\tilde{X})$, understanding $\\tilde{X}$ to be some representation generally, is certainly not novel in and of itself (vide Madras et al., 2018 in the context of the adjacent field of fair-representation learning); the method chosen used to accomplish this maximisation seems, to me, largely incidental -- one can simply view the contrastive loss as an alternative reconstruction loss.\n- The paper proposes learning a data transformation instead of a representation but the codomain of the transformation is another seemingly incidental factor given that interpretability does not appear to be a major concern, based on the narrative and analysis; indeed, in order to compute the contrastive learning objective in a space in which distances are meaningful, the transformed and original samples ultimately have to be embedded in such a representation anyway. The learning of a data transformation instead of a low-dimensional representation leads to a method that is more complicated than seemingly need be, and, moreover, is a design choice that comes at a steep computational cost -- computing all losses in representation space would be much more efficient though there may be some sound theoretical barrier to do doing so.\n- The mathematical formalism is confusing and, at times, unrigorous. Random variables and their realisations are seemingly conflated without reference to the abuse: mutual information, $\\mathcal{I}(\\cdot; \\cdot)$ is defined between pairs of random variables, not their empirical counterparts. While there is an argument to be made that such overloading is conventional and remedied by the context, I don't think that the latter is entirely satisifed here, especially with their being no express mention of this overloading being adopted throughout the paper.\n- While their meaning, as analogues of $X_p$ and $X_n$, respectively, can be easily inferred, $F_p$ and $F_n$, appearing in Eq.17, seem to be missing explicit definitions. The explanation given in Sec. 4.4,both textually and notationally, is generally muddled considering that the method amounts to SimCLR with the original and transformed samples acting as anchors and positive pairs.\n- Why compute cross-entropy terms w.r.t. the estimates of $P(U_i|X)$ and $P(S_i|X)$ as opposed to simply using the (degenerate ground-truth distribution (the annotations) used in the fitting of those estimates? There may be good reason for it but there should clear explanation given for why this choice is unprincipled, should that indeed be the case.\n- The quality of the writing, in terms of clarity and structure, could generally do with improvement.\n- Lack of ablation studies, such as those investigating the influence of the loss prefactor.\n- No discussion of the practical challenges entailed by adversarial infomin (vide Song and Shmatikov, 2021, for instance).\n\n\n### References\nMadras D, Creager E, Pitassi T, Zemel R.
