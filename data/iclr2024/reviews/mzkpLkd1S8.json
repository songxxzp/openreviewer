                "value": "I acknowledge the effort of the authors in this work, but I am afraid it suffers from serious drawbacks making it unpublishable in its current form.\n\n**Major comments**\n1. As underlined by the authors, the nullspace is a concept from linear algebra. When moving to the nonlinear world, its counterpart is the zero set. This is a common tool in convex optimization [1] which the authors may want to investigate. It seems however that rather than looking for a set of zeros, the authors are more interested in looking for invariance of the ViT wrt some additive subspaces (this is equation (5)). It may be interesting to change a bit the narrative to motivate it by invariant properties instead of null space properties?\n2. Similarly, the authors state in the conclusion that \"Our findings demonstrate that a non-trivial nullspace indeed exists\" but I am not sure that the paper shows that. The authors show that a nullspace exists for the patch embedding layer, but then the full study resolves more around invariance properties of the ViT than its nullspace.\n3. The authors write: \"We ascertain that employing noise sampled from this approximate nullspace for data augmentation significantly enhances model robustness ...\". This formulation suggests that the training of the ViT performance can improve when trained on data from its nullspace; however if the data shown to the network belong to its nullspace, how can it have an influence on its output?\n4. I have an issue with loss (6). Unless I misunderstood, it is not lower bounded because no constraint is added. Thus, the minimum of (6) is reached by any vector of infinite norm. Why not add any constraint in the norm of $\\tilde{v}$? I suspect this is why early stopping is needed (page 18)?\n5. More generally, I find it interesting to look for vectors of relatively large norms, showing that very different inputs can provide the same output. However, a problem is that the resulting vector $u+\\tilde{v}$, where $u$ is a natural image, is not a natural image. What are the potential applications in this context? Is it better for a model to be robust to nullspace variations than to common adversarial attacks?\n6. Section 3 is very clearly unfinished, with unrelated sentences and equations. What is the narrative from (7) to (10)?\n7. In section 3, the authors state that \"we demonstrated that there may exist a non-isotropic space\". Was it really shown that it is non isotropic?\n8. Section 4.4 is very difficult to follow. What is the aim of the experiment presented there? For instance, the authors claim \"the noise was always able to enter the $\\epsilon$ region\". But how can we be sure? Does any metric check that? This is not what Fig. 3 is showing, or I misunderstand?\n9. The writing style is often inapropriate. I would suggest the authors adopt a more neutral tone. Here are few examples and why I think these are not appropriate:\n     - \"Our work marks an important stride in the understanding of [something]...\" : this sounds presomptuous, readers will judge if this is \"an important stride\". Instead, the authors could say \"Our work provides an explanation of [something] by ...\". Similarly, \"we offer a fresh narrative\" sounds weird.\n     - \"This observation leads to a provocative question: Can the inherent properties of ViTs be harnessed to bolster their robustness?\" First of all, I think the question is not provocative at all, it is typically the kind of questions that are asked in this conference. Secondly, the question could be reformulated in a less theatrical way. For instance: \"This observation raises the following question: Can we leverage the inherent properties of ViTs to enhance their robustness?\"\n\n**Minor comments**\n\n1. Some notations are unclear. For example, $f(u)[0]$ mixes mathematical and informatics notations. Why not use $f_0(u)$? \n2. \"This implies that 0 is always a solution to the said equation. As the number of solutions to a system of linear equations can vary, the nullspace for a mapping can be trivial, non-trivial, or does not exist.\" You just showed above that a trivial nullspace always exists for a linear mapping. How can the nullspace not exist?\n3. \"In terms of solving for $\\mathcal{N}$?\": why this question? I think that the footnote does not need to be introduced by a question.\n4. For the remark after Proposition 1: there is no need to explain the proposition in the remark. I would suggest to only keep the informative example, and detail more on this example. Is this a condition that is met experimentally? Is this realistic?\n5. Maybe the authors could change the NeurIPS watermark to an ICLR watermark?\n\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Bauschke, H. H., and P. L.
