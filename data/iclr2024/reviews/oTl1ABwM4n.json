Its current explanation is unclear.\n\n- Does this idea work for tasks other than sorting? Could you apply the same to many other tasks?\n\n- Can you use the factor analysis (e.g., those introduced in the recent paper [1]) for the interpretation part?

When trained on sequences of length up to 20, the model gets less than 1% accuracy on sequences of length 100 (and scaling training dataset size or model size doesn't help much). However, when the training dataset is augmented with an auxiliary and simpler task of predicting the successor of a given number in the sorted list, the accuracy at length 100 jumps significantly. Not surprisingly, the efficacy of this method varies between different auxiliary tasks. \n\nFurther, the paper also suggests a theoretical construction for how a 2-layer Transformer might be able to do this task. The theoretical construction uses a length-dependent parameter used for the softmax operation in attention layers. The introduction of this length-dependent parameter is empirically shown to help in length generalization (even in the absence of auxiliary tasks)."
