While I admit that the paper made contribution in capturing the differences between using existing algorithmic stability methods to determine copyright infringement and applying copyright law, the technical contributions is not significant and do not help to address the problems. The main theoretical result is Proposition 1, which most people would likely anticipate. From my opinion, the most valuable part is Section 3, but this part does not contain any technical discussion.\n\n2.\tAnother issue with this paper is that critique of NAF and DP does not lead to new quantifiable algorithmic stability approach immediately, not does it shed light on how to modify these notions to better resonate with the essence of copyright law.\n\n3.  The paper lacks empirical or experimental results that would solidly substantiate its technical claims. For instance, 1) DP does not allow high influence under a satisfactory 'copyright definition', 2) NAF can allow models that may memorize completely the training set as long as a content they output does not provide a proof for such memorization.\n \n4. There is contradiction between the legal and technical discussions. For example, the authors initially assert that a satisfactory \"copyright definition\" must allow algorithms to be highly influenced. However, in discussing the 'overly exclusive' of algorithmic stability, they claim that protection is confined to concrete 'expressions' and does not encompass abstract \"ideas\".\n\n5. While the paper conceptually identifies the problem, it does not propose a practical solution or methodology to prevent copyright infringement, nor does it provide any discussions towards that end."

The entire discourse in Section 3 orbits around the disparity between practical application and algorithmic stability methods. These methods are not exclusively confined to Differential Privacy (DP), but are more associated with the more versatile concept of NAF. The main purpose of NAF is to provide a measurement of a model's copyright protection, rather than privacy protection. However, this discussion strays from the main theme of whether privacy can reduce to copyright. From my perspective, this paper is more centered on the incongruity between NAF and copyright protection in practice.\n\n3. please provide some experimental results to further support your claims on the limitation of DP and the flexibility of NAF.\n\n4.  clarify the contradictions between the legal and technical discussions, and provide empirical evidence if necessary.\n5. discuss the potential solutions\n\n\n3.\tOn page 9, I am still uncertain about the distinction between \"convert murky standards into rigid rules\" and \"make legal standards less murky\" in the context of computer science methodology. If we intend to incorporate CS methodology into the legal profession to clarify legal standards, rigid rules are inevitable. Could the authors further elaborate on this?\n\n4.\tThe writing in some parts can be further improved. For example, what does \\eta mean in Proposition 1."

It is conceptually very difficult to separate (1) and (2), and the paper makes some attempts to clarify this line using DP/NAF, but I am not sure that it succeeds.

While algorithmic stability might seem like a useful method for identifying copying, it doesn't automatically ensure copyright protection. The authors pinpoint several discrepancies between algorithmic stability strategies and copyright regulations, illustrating why the implementation of such strategies might not fully consider fundamental copyright principles. Consequently, the paper suggests that if algorithmic stability techniques become the standard for addressing copyright infringement, they could undermine the original objectives of copyright law. The authors emphasize the necessity for any copyright concept to establish a clear distinction between protected expressions and unprotected ideas, highlighting a challenge that algorithmic stability concepts such as DP might not effectively address in certain cases. They provide instances where several elements of copyright law complicate the simplification of the copyright issue to a matter of privacy:\n - Copyright protections have a time limit, allowing works to enter the public domain after the expiration of protection. This implies that DP might be excessively stringent as a privacy notion. \n - Copyright law excludes certain subject matter from protection as they serve as raw material for cultural expression, a factor not readily addressed by privacy considerations. \n - Privacy protects content rather than expression, which differs from the scope of copyright law. \n - Copyright law promotes the use of copyrighted materials through specific transformative uses, including quotations and parodies, a dimension not fully encapsulated by privacy concerns.\n\nIn summary, the paper prompts critical thinking on why DP and NAF fail to effectively address the copyright problem. However, it lacks a comprehensive proposal for a practical resolution."

While these special use cases make sense (e.g., Copyright is limited in time; copyright law encourages the use of copyrighted materials for transformative use cases) the authors merely identify these use cases without providing a technical copyright notion that would help make a step towards a more realistic copyright notion. In my view, both DP and NAF already do a good job at ensuring copyright law is upheld. As the authors note, to claim that the output of a generative model infringes copyright, a plaintiff must: \n 1. prove that the model had access to her copyrighted work; and\n 2. prove that the alleged copy is substantially similar to her original work.\n\nTherefore, it is my understanding that any reasonable algorithm to ensure copyright, must either make sure that the model behaves as if it had no access to the copyrighted work or that the model makes sure that the generated output is dissimilar to the original work. In my understanding, (1) is guaranteed by DP and in doing that DP is quite conservative, e.g., copyright law does allow the output to be influenced by the original work if it is sufficiently dissimilar from the original work which DP prohibits. Another strategy can lie in simply making sure that the generated output is dissimilar to the original work. This is what NAF aims to achieve targeting point (2). To summarize, the work does not offer a constructive solution that helps solve these problems.\n\n**Unclear theoretical results.** The theoretical results do not seem self-contained \u2013 e.g., to properly understand the paper, you must have read the work by Vyas et al (2023).
