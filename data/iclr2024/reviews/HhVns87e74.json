However, I find the experimental work lacking. Addressing my concerns and questions can improve the score.\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Independent Subnetwork Training (IST) in the context of distributed machine learning with a focus on data and model parallelism. The study identifies the lack of a rigorous understanding of IST convergence as a motivation for the research. The main contributions of this work include a novel approach to analyzing distributed methods that combine data and model parallelism, an analysis of IST in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios without restrictive gradient estimator assumptions, and the identification of settings where IST can optimize efficiently or converge to a well-characterized irreducible neighborhood. The research is supported by carefully designed experiments and provides valuable insights into the advantages and limitations of IST in large-scale machine learning."

Performing only one gradient computation at each node requires very frequent communication with the server, which will incur high communication costs. Hence, performing multiple gradient descent steps in the local mode is more desired as in the IST work [1] and [2]. I admit taking multiple steps may hurt the accuracy, while the main motivation of IST is saving communication costs under the accuracy-efficiency trade-off.\n*  **Why is the gradient sparsification introduced in Eq.6 for IST?** The original IST work formulated the IST training method as Eq(69)  without the gradient sparsification operator. The authors state that \u201cit can create a significant disparity between theory and practice\u201d in Appendix D. I didn\u2019t notice that IST uses any form of gradient sparsification, as IST is orthogonal to gradient sparsification techniques.
