While existing domain generalization (DG) methods assume consistent class spaces between source and target domains, AAA is a Heterogeneous Domain Generalization (HDG) method tailored for single-source cross-dataset ReID.\n\nAAA jointly trains a feature extractor, a Domain Adversarial Network (DAN), and a Class Adversarial Network (CAN) to enhance the feature extractor's robustness to both domain shifts and changes in class spaces. Additionally, the paper introduces a diversity-based perturbation impact factor to dynamically adjust the augmentation strategy based on the diversity of learned embeddings.\n\nExperimental results indicate that AAA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale cross-dataset ReID benchmarks. In summary, the paper's contributions are the development of an HDG approach, the introduction of DAN and CAN, and the dynamic augmentation strategy, all of which lead to improved ReID performance in heterogeneous domains."

                "value": "1. The paper's presentation left room for improvement, particularly in terms of clarifying its contributions. Figure 1 broadly illustrates the motivation behind the proposed method. However, the distinction between cross-dataset ReID and supervised ReID is widely known. To strengthen the paper's motivation, it is advisable to delineate the variances between single-source cross-data, single-source UDA, single-source DG, and multi-source DG, as presented in Figure 1 of the referenced literature [1]. Furthermore, the authors' contributions require clearer enumeration. The section on UDA methods should be concise, with a greater focus on the paper's unique contributions.\n\n2. The level of innovation in this work appears to be somewhat incremental. The authors' CAN within the AAA framework bears a striking resemblance to DAN. Equations 7 and 8 are essentially identical to Equations 1 and 2, with the sole replacement of \"domain\" with \"class.\"\n\n3. The experimental aspect of the paper exhibits some shortcomings. Firstly, it fails to compare the proposed method with the latest DG techniques, such as GMoE [2]. Secondly, relying solely on ResNet is insufficient. It is crucial to demonstrate the applicability of the method to ViT.\n\n\n\nSuggestions:\n1. For the author's method name abbreviation, it may be that A^3 is better compared to AAA.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Yuyang Zhao, Zhun Zhong, Fengxiang Yang, Zhiming Luo, Yaojin Lin, Shaozi Li, and Nicu Sebe.

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. **Evaluating Unsupervised Methods**: Given the significant challenges faced in single-source cross-dataset ReID and the relatively low performance of existing methods (For instance, the performance does not exceed 1% on MSMT17. ), it is worth exploring the potential of unsupervised methods. Unsupervised learning, where models learn from unlabeled data, might provide better adaptability to unseen datasets. A question to consider is whether unsupervised ReID methods, which rely on domain adaptation, can surpass the limitations of supervised methods and achieve higher accuracy in cross-dataset scenarios. Investigating the efficacy of unsupervised learning approaches in this context could shed light on new directions for ReID research.\n\n2. **Generalized vs. Tailored Approaches**: The authors' proposed method, as observed, seems to have a broader scope as a generalized cross-dataset approach, rather than being tailored specifically for ReID. While this generality is valuable for cross-domain scenarios, it's essential to assess its performance in comparison to ReID-specific techniques. Therefore, an interesting question emerges: How does the authors' method perform in a head-to-head comparison with state-of-the-art ReID algorithms designed explicitly for the task? Evaluating its performance in the context of domain adaptation, along with conventional ReID models, would help clarify the method's strengths and limitations in ReID scenarios.\n\n3. **Evaluation with DomainBed**: DomainBed is a versatile framework for domain generalization and domain adaptation tasks. Given the authors' method's broader applicability, it is pertinent to inquire about its performance when rigorously tested within the DomainBed framework. Assessing how the authors' method handles domain adaptation and generalization challenges, along with benchmarking against other specialized methods within DomainBed, could provide valuable insights into its adaptability and comparative effectiveness across diverse domains.\n\nThese questions delve deeper into the challenges, scope, and implications of the authors' work and can serve as a basis for further discussion and exploration in the field of cross-dataset ReID and domain adaptation in computer vision."

The proposed CAN+dynamic lambda is more like a refined regularization constraint on the DAN, and does not jump out of the DAN's scope. More explanation from the author is needed to highlight their differences and contributions.\n(-) [Incremental novelty] Following the previous comment, although the authors analyze in the experimental section (Figure 5) that DAN and CAN focus on different background-related and pedestrian-related regions, respectively, it is still possible to see that there are also pedestrian-highlighted regions in DAN's map (similar to CAN). It makes me more likely to stick to my previous comment.\n(-) [Unclear definition] The definition in section 3.1 is not detailed and reader-friendly enough. (a) The explanation of  \\mathcal{Y}^i appears before the usage of it. (b) What is the role of the joint probability distribution P_(X,Y)? It doesn't seem to appear after the definition.\n(-) [Experiment] In the abstract, the authors emphasize that AAA is specifically designed for the single-source setting. At the method level, however, the proposed method has little relevance to single- or multi-domain settings, because eventually, the authors modeled domain features with a camera. Therefore I am curious about the performance of the proposed AAA in a multi-source domain setting, or the reasons why experiments in the multi-source domain setting cannot be carried out."
