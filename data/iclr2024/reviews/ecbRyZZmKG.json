                "value": "With the rapid development in Large Language Models (LLMs), business owners are increasingly exploring the customization of pre-trained LLMs through APIs provided by LLM owners or cloud servers. However, this process carries substantial risks of model misuse, making the protection of copyrights for these customized models a pressing issue. Currently, the majority of LLM watermarking research concentrates on small-scale models for specific tasks or pre-trained models, and these methods unsuitable for customized LLMs. The application scenarios of customized LLMs present new challenges for watermarking techniques: they must not degrade model performance while maintaining watermark uniqueness and imperceptibility. Most crucially, since the watermarking embedding process can't access the full model parameters, the model remains a black box for those embedding the watermark. To address these challenges, the authors propose an efficient and robust watermarking embedding method tailored for customized LLMs. By designing two types of backdoor data paradigms with triggers in the instruction and input and mixing them with the normal training data during the fine-tuning process, the model can learn unique knowledge related to watermarking. Owners can then verify their ownership by guiding the model to produce specific outputs using a unique trigger. Furthermore, the authors ensure the effectiveness of this method through theoretical analysis and experimental verification."

This logical progression effectively addresses the challenges initially posed.\n2.

The overall problem is framed as a judgment question, further enhancing the method's Uniqueness and Efficiency.\n3. The paper features extensive experiments that convincingly validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Beyond this, the authors conduct a multifaceted set of tests, including a non-harmful test to ensure that the watermark embedding does not significantly degrade model performance, robustness tests against second-time fine-tuning and model quantization, and an ablation study concerning the reference set to further substantiate the rationality of their backdoor data framework design."

Such rarity, however, could potentially be a drawback for these types of watermarking methods. Given that the target environment is cloud-based LLMs, providers could preprocess user inputs to filter out these decorations and triggers, thereby causing erroneous verifications. The design of triggers, in this context, warrants a more nuanced discussion by the authors.\n\n2. In section 3.3.3 \"THE MIX-UP OF MULTIPLE TYPES,\" the authors mention that \"it is possible to embed multiple Double-I watermarks in a model, which theoretically has the potential to enhance the robustness of our watermarking technique.\" The theoretical substantiation for this claim is lacking, especially considering that multiple types of watermarks could interact and affect each other. More theoretical proofs or appropriate literature citations are needed to validate this assertion."
