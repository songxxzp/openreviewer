                "value": "The manuscript presents a novel semi-supervised method termed as Geometrically Regularized Alignment (GeRA) to effectively align the embedding spaces of pretrained encoders. This approach is characterized by its alignment of two distinct latent spaces into a unified space, leveraging a dual penalty system. The first penalty is a contrastive loss that ensures corresponding points in these spaces are brought close together, while the second, a geometric loss, preserves the inherent local geometry of spaces as learned by the pretrained encoders. A distinguishing feature of this work is the introduction of the geometric loss, which constructs a kernel matrix over neighbors for each sample, aiming to minimize potential distortions when projecting each space in the shared one."

The simplicity of the idea that neighboring points in the source spaces should remain neighbors in the aligned space, thus preserving the semantic structures, is a strength of this work.\n- The ablation studies presented in the paper are  comprehensive and convincing, enhancing  the presented results.\n- The benchmark against ASIF, and subsequently extending this comparison to other pretrained models, is a strong selling point.  \n- A well-thought hyperparameter search has been executed. Notably, also the competitor ASIF has gone through an hyperparameter search."

For instance, when a 3% improvement in performance is highlighted, it becomes crucial to understand the variance arising from different initialization seeds. Reporting standard deviations would have offered a clearer picture of the model's robustness and reliability.\n- The manuscript introduces additional hyperparameters, yet it does not provide sufficient insight into their impact on downstream performance. Without guiding intuition, the only approach seems to be extensive hyperparameter tuning, which might be computationally expensive and time-consuming.\n- The discussion regarding inference time, particularly in relation to ASIF that performs vector search (i.e. retrieval) using cosine similarity, may be misleading. Existing libraries, such as faiss [1], offer methodologies for more efficient vector searches (e.g., approximate or hierarchical techniques). As such, the paper's emphasis on superior performance compared to a naive ASIF implementation could potentially be misleading to the reader.\n- There is no publicly available code to reproduce the work.\n\nOverall, I think this paper is good enough to be accepted. However, the work would benefit from further validation, specifically regarding the statistical significance of the improvements reported. *The reviewer is ready to further raise the score if the authors present additional evidence regarding the statistical significance.*\n\n---\n\n[1] Johnson, Jeff, Matthijs Douze, and Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou. 2017. \u201cBillion-Scale Similarity Search with GPUs.\u201d, IEEE Transactions on Big Data."

The regularization term is based on a kernel function of the locality around each point that encourages the nearest neighbors to stay in their relative positions. The experiments section evaluates the effectiveness of the geometric regularization compared with various baselines on the CC12m and concludes that the method is effective in a low data regime."

However, I cannot find any experiment in section 5 that trains on a mixture of unpaired and paired data where paired data is small. If so, please name the dataset used in section 5. Is unpaired data referring to the data used for pretraining the models? If no experiments are done that use unpaired data during the alignment, at least the following sentence in the abstract should be corrected: \u201cOur method leverages the manifold geometry of unpaired (unlabeled) data to improve alignment performance.\u201d and the following sentence in Section 3: \u201c...we propose to leverage unlabeled (unpaired) points from each modality to preserve the rich geometric structure of their original embedding spaces.\u201d\n- The effectiveness of the method is limited to the low-data regime with paired data fewer than 10^5 samples and the performance is significantly lower than a model trained with just one order of magnitude more paired samples. So at least for image-text and speech-text modalities where available paired data is significantly more than 10^5, it is not clear how the proposed method can be helpful. In other words, when would it be useful to use GeRA instead of ASIF or the standard contrastive loss? Would it be for training other multi-modal models where the paired data is few? If so, do authors believe that the two examples of image-text and speech-text can be extrapolated to other multi-modal models?"

Can we also evaluate these models for unimodal metrics such as unimodal retrieval such as image-image text-text retrieval?\n- Is Figure 1 related to any model trained and evaluated in Section 5? Can we confirm that the model trained with GeRA is also a strong model according to zero-shot metrics?\n- Eq. 3: What is the dimensionality of W? Is it MxM or N_k x N_k?
