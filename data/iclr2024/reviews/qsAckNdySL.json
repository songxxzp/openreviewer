This literature should be identified and reviewed, and the current proposal placed in that context in a precise way. A Google Scholar search should identify relevant papers.\n3.\tThe idea of estimating counterfactual predictions is also not new. Again, the literature on that enterprise should be reviewed, and the current proposal situated in this larger literature.\n4.\tOn p. 3, the proposal of representing discrete models using degenerate Gaussian distributions is entertained. A paper from several years ago elaborates this idea in the context of CSL: Andrews et al. Learning high-dimensional directed acyclic graphs with mixed data-types. In The 2019 ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Causal Discovery (pp. 4-21). PMLR.

Pearl's three-step counterfactual algorithm offers a theoretical approach but is often impractical due to incomplete knowledge of the underlying structural causal models. The paper introduces the so-called DiscoModel, based on the belief that \"Causality is invariance across heterogeneous units,\" and its underlying theory is the Distribution-consistency Structural Causal Models (DiscoSCMs), which is reviewed in the Appendix of the manuscript. The authors claim that the DiscoModel can effectively address all three PCH layers and is the first to provide concrete answers to complex counterfactual questions, as shown through experiments."

DiscoModel presents several strengths.\n\nIt can be claimed that it is a novel approach to causality, which treats causality as invariance across heterogeneous units. This inherent flexibility in treating heterogeneous units is both novel and relevant.\n\nIt introduces ActionNet,  a new mechanism to compute parameters for the outcome variable. By taking heterogeneous unit representation as input, it offers a level of granularity that may be missing in other models.\n\nUnlike traditional causal modeling frameworks, which often make consistent predictions based on a consistency rule, DiscoSCM can predict outcomes with varied probabilities, acknowledging the idea that decisions often occur under circumstances where chance cannot be controlled. \n\nDiscoModel is claimed to be able to provide practical and reasonable estimations across the three layers of valuations. This broad spectrum applicability enhances its utility in diverse scenarios.  DiscoModel allows for heterogeneous counterfactual estimation across units. Notably, as per the authors, this hadn't been reached by any prior work."
