Recent research [1,2] indicates that achieving high levels of novelty, uniqueness, and validity on QM9 and ZINC250K is not particularly challenging; for instance, merely adding carbons can suffice. It's evident from recent studies [1,2] that both the genetic algorithm [3] and the reinvent method [5] serve as potent baselines. This paper should benchmark against a broader set of baselines to truly showcase its performance in molecular design tasks. Furthermore, molecular properties such as plogp and qed are often deemed impractical [1] and not truly beneficial for real-world inverse molecule design tasks.\n\nW3: In GDSS, node features and graph structures are treated as separate diffusion processes. The connection between this approach and the proposed method requires deeper exploration.\n\nW4: The assumption that \"the properties are independent conditioned on the structure\" in Equation 15 is unjustified and not reliable.\n\nOther minor points:\n\nW5: The pictures should be of higher resolution.\n\nW6: There are several typos, such as the \"}\" symbol, in Figure 1.\n\nW7: Definitions of the variables should be clarified.

What does the models ($s_{\\\\phi_i, t}$) approximate?\n  3. How is the training objective derived? Is it a straightforward extension of score matching objective?\n\n- Several claims made in the paper are not clear and requires justification:\n  1. ( as explained in Intro) How does the parent process guide the childe processes? From what I have understood, the paraent process and child processes are dependent to each other rather than specific process guiding others, similar to the processes of GDSS. In particular, the proposed diffusion framework seems to be a system of multiple processes (parent and childs) with some dependency conditions given betwen the variables, and the score functions are dependent to all the variables including additional context.\n  2. Is the assumption on independence between child variables valid for the experiments? As what I have understood, the child variables represent some chemical properties, for which do not seem to be independent to each other.\n  3. (at the end of Sec. 3.4 and Tab. 1) What does the energy guidance mechanism indicate? Why is the additional influence of $s_{\\\\phi_i}$ characterized as an energy guidance?\n\n- As FDP requires multiple score models (for the primary and child variables), I presume the number of model parameters required  for FDP would be quire large. Ablation study on number of model parameters could strengthen the effectiveness of the proposed framework.\n\n- Important experimental details, for example, model architecture or what the variables actually represents, are not provided in the main paper. There seems to be some explanation in Appendix B, but not referenced by the main paper.\n\n- The reason for superior performance on unconditional molecule generation (Sec. 4.4) is not clear. Especially, an important baseline, GDSS, seems to be missing in Tab. 6.\n\n- Missed some previous works on conditional graph generation:\n  - Vignac et al., DiGress: Discrete Denoising diffusion for graph generation, ICLR 2023\n  - Lee et al., Exploring Chemical Space with Score-based Out-of-distribution Generation, ICML 2023"

Most importantly, as the author just directly introducing these additional variables (with a simple conditional independent assumption among properties given the graph), the properties are not aligned with the intermediate graphs during the SDE process. This makes the method not very reasonable. For example, as there is no direct correspondance between graphs and properties, it is possible that the generated properties are not aligning with the generated graph. The alignment between property and graph at individual level is very important, all experiments don't have evaluation on this individual alignment. Only population-level MAE for these properties are evaluated. \n3. In the experiment of generic graph generation, I don't see a clear difference of the population-level MAE between the proposed method and naive baseline GDSS, which may indicates that the method is not very effective. \n4. Table 6 shows the result over unconditional generation, although this is not the intention of the designed method, I'm curious why the baseline only include GDSS-seq instead of the original GDSS. \n5.
