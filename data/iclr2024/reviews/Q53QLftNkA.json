The model is pre-trained  to reconstruct  the input features using MSE loss. Once the models are trained, the embeddings are passed through an MLP classifier to perform 10 different utterance-level speech tasks. As compared to the vanilla masked auto encoders, the proposed multi-window masked AE (MW-MAE) performs slightly better on those 10 tasks based on the overall score. If we look at each task separately, on some tasks the vanilla MAE performs better and in others the proposed MW-MAE performs better although the differences are usually small."

Multiscale approaches are not particularly new but this might be the first application of it to audio representation learning with masked AE. \n\n- Quality:\nEven though the proposed method is sound and extensive evaluations have been conducted for it, the performance gains due to using this model is limited as compared to the vanilla masked AE. Given other concerns about the run-time \n\n- Clarity:\nThe paper is mostly easy to follow.

                "value": "1.The conceptualization of this article is relatively straightforward. Building upon the previous global-local attention mechanism, previous studies did not incorporate a hierarchical design for the local window perspective. Hence, the author implemented a mechanism with varying window sizes for each attention head within the multi-head attention mechanism. This initial approach is commendable. I am intrigued to know if the author is the originator of this multi-window local-global attention concept for the first time. No pertinent references were found at the end of the introduction, maybe leaving open the possibility of existing similar ideas in the fields of computer vision or natural language processing.\n\n2.In terms of the experimental aspect, \"the default configuration employed by the authors yields np = 250, resulting in window sizes of [2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, 250, 250] for each MW-MHA module in all decoder blocks, encompassing a total of eight attention heads.\" Although the author clarifies that this hyperparameter design covers several possible local context levels and adopts a simplistic set of designs, further ablation experiments pertaining to this aspect would be valuable.\n\n3.Corresponding to the points highlighted by the author in Appendix G, the experiments conducted solely focused on the (AS-5k) dataset. However, as a self-supervised model, it is expected that the author would train on larger datasets, given the significance of datasets such as librilight, which have already amassed 60k hours of data. Furthermore, exploring the model's performance on larger datasets would provide insights into its upper limits.\n\n4.A meticulous examination of the author's ablation experiments on the parameters of MAE in the appendix reveals that, under different parameter configurations and tasks, MW-MAE does not exhibit significant improvements compared to MAE. For instance, [BO, Patch Size=(4\u00d78), n=500, h=12, MAE 96.7\u00b10.2, MW-MAE 95.6\u00b10.7], [Mris-s all], [Mri-T all]. Similar observations can be made in the main experiments presented in Table 1. In certain tasks, a comprehensive enhancement is not evident. Consequently, I eagerly anticipate the author's elucidation regarding this aspect."

Alternatively, more engaging designs and comparisons could be conducted by examining the relationship between the number of attention heads, network hierarchies, and window sizes."
