The paper introduces multiple FB-IL methods, each mimicking existing IL approaches. However, these FB-IL models, are trained using pre-trained domain-specific FB models (that were not exposed to reward or demonstrations of tartidular tasks), reducing computation time significantly. This is because he model of the environment and how the agent can interact with it are pre-trained, and IL training primarily focuses on finding the right policy embedding (z)."

As such, the paper lists the main IL approaches and for each, introduces an FB-based variant that mimics that approach. In that respect this paper presents not one but **multiple** methods that are quite distict from one another yet all sare the same (FB) representation framework, thus driving home the point that the FB framework is quite versatile and does not limit the IL approaches."

Note that this can be seen as a strength of the work it self.\n\nPrior work on the FB framework has been limited to the somewhat simplistic gym environments, This work is no different. While the FB framework can scale by increasing the complexity of the embedding functions and the dimensionality of the policy representation space, it is unclear, at this point, that the framework can serve well in non-simulated environments. IL seems to me to be a practical method for real world problems and it would be nice to see FB applied to non-simulation (or more complex) environments."

Is the arg max optimization occuring at every step or is the policy represented in yet another model that needs to be trained to estimate this arg max? If so how fast is that trainig?"

These policy embeddings should be approximately optimal for a particular reward function. The authors show how to leverage the FB representation to perform various forms of imitation learning by reusing the FB representation and learning an appropriate policy embedding for the imitation task.\n\nThe work is well-motivated, and the importance is perhaps understated; imitation learning is a staple in many communities, and this paper provides notable improvements over well-established methods.
