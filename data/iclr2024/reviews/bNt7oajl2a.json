                "value": "- The results would be more informative if compared directly with human performance. Do any of these benchmarks contain human performance measures (e.g. I believe that there is already human behavioral data for miniSCAN in the original paper)?\n- The results on noisy rule induction are especially difficult to interpret without a human baseline. The authors cite a paper indicating that humans are somewhat robust to noise when inducing rules, but the amount of noise and the specific tasks will matter a lot. \n- Throughout the paper, the authors appeal to intuition concerning putative human performance on the benchmarks they consider (e.g. in considering the potential for human reasoners to show a discrepancy between hypothesis generation and rule application), but intuition is not always a reliable guide regarding human performance. It would be good to qualify these statements a bit more (or, to the extent possible, to include a direct comparison with human performance).\n- The 'task accuracy' measure seems designed to emphasize the consistency of the symbolic rule application. When looking at raw accuracy, the differences between symbolic and LLM rule application don't look nearly as large. I think this somewhat undermines the claim that their rule application abilities are so much worse than their hypothesis generation abilities. \n- It should be emphasized more that miniARC, unlike the other tasks, is a distinctly visual task, in that it requires understanding visual concepts like 'objectness'. It is somewhat unsurprising that a text-only model would show special difficulty on such a task.\n- Do the authors have any explanation for why the hypothesis refinement approach achieves worse performance on miniARC relative to the baselines? Given the visual nature of the task, it's not surprising that it doesn't help much, but I was surprised that it actually seems to impair performance.\n- The familiarity analysis seems to confound two very different issues: 1) The presence of the same exact problems in the LLM pretraining data (a significant possibility, given the use of pre-existing datasets), and 2) the use of familiar vs. unfamiliar words (e.g. pseudowords). I think it's important to dissociate these concerns. This can be done by creating a new dataset with similar properties, e.g. by replacing the specific pseudowords and colors in miniSCAN (but maintaining the same general pseudoword -> color structure). \n- Is the interaction between iid vs. ood and IO vs. hypothesis refinement (figure 2) statistically significant? Also, the text describes the hypothesis refinement results as demonstrating superior robustness to this ood setting, but for miniARC the ood accuracy is actually higher for the IO baseline (even though the difference between iid and ood performance is larger for IO). This should be clarified in the text.\n- Were the language model and human hypotheses systematically compared in any way, or only qualitatively inspected? Did the strength of the language model hypotheses correspond to performance on the task? Were there cases where the model performed well on the task despite providing unhuman-like hypotheses?\n\n## Minor comments:\n- What setting was used for the 'top p' parameter in GPT-4?\n- It would be helpful to either include the variable names in figure 1, or to have a separate figure illustrating the overall flow of the model with the corresponding variable names.\n- It would be good to say a bit more about how this work differs from Wang et al (2023). This is concurrent work, so there is no concern about novelty, but it would still be useful to have more discussion of the relationship.\n- I found the description of the approach somewhat confusing. Based on the abstract and intro, I was expecting that the hypotheses would be articulated in natural language, and this would somehow be translated into code which is then symbolically executed. It is explained later on (in section 2.2) that the LM also carries out this translation step for list functions and miniARC, but it would be good to provide some hint that this is the case earlier in the section describing the approach. My understanding is that for the other tasks, the LM is prompted so as to ensure hypotheses in a particular format, which can then be automatically parsed, is that correct? It would be helpful to clarify this (in section 2 it says that the hypotheses are 'constrained', but it's not immediately clear what that means).\n- I found this sentence, 'However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps in rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules)\u2026' to be confusing, because it seems to say that LLMs are bad at proposing rules, even though it was just stated that they are good at this. This also seems misaligned with the results. It seems like this sentence should instead emphasize the rule application specifically (though, as mentioned above, it's not clear how significant this discrepancy really is).\n- The authors might consider citing this related work on analogical reasoning (a special case of inductive reasoning) in LLMs: Webb, T., Holyoak, K. J., & Lu, H. (2023). Emergent analogical reasoning in large language models. Nature Human Behaviour."

It would be interesting to see how the number of revisions affects performance, similar to Table 2 in the concurrent \"Hypothesis Search\" paper from Wang et al. I see there is some version of this in this paper's Table 2, but given the emphasis that this paper places of hypothesis refinement, I'd expect a bit more detail.

According to the appendix, example rules on List Fn and MiniARC are generated from LM with a prompt that contains no format instruction. It is unknown whether LMs can generate human-like inductions with more guidance or provided with human-induced rules as few shot examples.\n\nOverall, I believe the main contribution of the paper is an effective inductive reasoning pipeline using LMs. So these are not significant flaws of the paper. So I still recommend acceptance. However, I strongly encourage authors to provide more rigorous evidence when making claims in Section 4."
