This study has the potential to make a substantial impact on the deep learning community.\n\nThe paper introduces a framework for analyzing the convergence and generalization of neural networks trained using gradient descent for score-based generative models. In particular, the authors investigate the relationship between minimizing the score-matching problem (as defined in equation 5) and training neural networks (as defined in equation 8). The authors demonstrate that, under conditions of overparameterization, where the neural networks are sufficiently wide, minimizing the score-matching problem is equivalent to training the neural networks to directly learn input samples or images, as stated in Theorem 3.9 and Theorem 3.10."

The primary contribution lies in establishing a connection between stochastic optimization (as defined in equation 5) and deterministic optimization (as defined in equation 8). Once this connection is made, the convergence and generation results appear as corollaries drawn from existing literature. Additionally, this connection is also not new, as it was proposed in [1].\n2. Building upon the first point, the results concerning convergence and generalization in this paper can be considered incremental, as they rely on NTK-type analysis, which is identical to previous work in the literature and does not introduce novel insights.\n3. However, if one were to directly analyze or train the stochastic optimization in equation 5, the results would likely differ significantly, even when employing NTK-type analysis. This is because, in this case, the NTK would encapsulate randomness arising from the Brownian motion.\n4. It's important to note that this work is purely theoretical and lacks empirical experimentation to validate its assumptions, such as Assumption 3.2, Assumption 3.4, Assumption 3.5, Assumption 3.7, Assumption 3.8, and Assumption 3.11.\n5. The authors categorize errors into four parts: coupling, label mismatch, early stopping, and approximation. Without conducting numerical experiments, it becomes challenging to determine which error contributes the most. As a result, this work does not provide substantial practical insights.\n\n[1]  Learning Lipschitz functions by gd-trained shallow overparameterized ReLU neural networks."

In a random feature model $a$ is trained while $W$ is generated randomly. In the NTK regime it is also assumed that $W$ does not change too much during training, hence the problem reduces to fitting a linear model with $a$ representing the coefficients. \n2. Why the authors propose to uniformly sample the time? In practice usually a non-uniform weight function is employed. How does the choice of weight function affect the result. \n3. I feel the most general form of Lemma 3.1 has already been established in many past works. See for example, section 5.1 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09251.pdf and the intro section of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11420.pdf. I think the authors should at least cite these papers and discuss the relation. \n4. How is $\\gamma$ initialized? \n5. The notation $\\beta_x$ is a bit confusiong. I assume it should not depend on $x$. Maybe the authors can state what does it depend on? \n6. I think Assumption 3.5 is a fact instead of an assumption when the target is bounded, at least when $g$ is a positive constant. This is because taking the gradient of the conditional expectation gives the conditional covaraince, which has bounded operator norm when data is bounded.  \n7. In Theorem 3.6, should I interpret $c_1$ as a universal constant? If not, what does it depend on?\n8. I might have missed something, but I feel the upper bound given in Theorem 3.6 is pretty large. Like it could be much larger than $O(d)$, the scale of the noisy label. Why is it an interesting bound?\n9. In Assumption 3.6 you mean $1 - \\delta (\\Delta, R)$? \n10. There are two delta functions in Assumption 3.7 and 3.8, what are their relation? \n11. I feel the second term in Theorem 3.9 upper bound is huge. If it is not, maybe the authors can comment on it a little bit. \n12. Could the authors elaborate more on why \"Assump- tion 3.11 can be satisfied by an extension of classical early stopping rules for scalar-valued kernel regression.\" Maybe giving an example in which this assumption is satisfied would be helpful for readers to digest."
