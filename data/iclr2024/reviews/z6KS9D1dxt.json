                "value": "The paper addresses Byzantine failures in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents can adopt malicious behavior due to malfunction caused by hardware/software faults. First, a new problem setting, called Bayesian Adversarial Robust Dec-POMDP (BARDec-POMDP), is proposed to model adversarial intervention as a transition, where originally cooperative joint actions are modified before being executed in the actual environment. The setting is inspired by Bayesian games, where agents have types that need to be inferred by other agents through their beliefs. The goal is to learn a more fine-grained solution than prior work, where policies are able to collaborate with functional agents, while being robust against adversaries therefore finding a better cooperation-robustness trade-off. Ex post mixed-strategy robust Bayesian Markov perfect equilibrium is proposed as a solution concept for BARDec-POMDPs, which is claimed to be weakly dominant over equilibria that were pursued in previous works.\n\nBased on this setting, a two-timescale actor-critic is proposed based on the robust Harsanyi-Bellman equation, defining the maximin value according to the ideal case (before any adversarial modification) and the adversarial case. The policy gradient uses the value of the adversarial case as critic. The approach is evaluated in a variety of games, including a matrix game, a gridworld game, and a map of SMAC. It is also evaluated against different attacker types."

Bayesian games provide a neat framework to discern between these types of agents, which is a convincing proposal.\n\nThe solution concept seems valid.\n\nI like the evaluation, which first starts with a small toy problem before scaling up to larger benchmarks like SMAC.

For example, important proofs can be sketched informally with little space, but delegating them to the appendix completely is not acceptable.\n\nBefore checking, if I can raise my score, I need a revised version of the paper that is more self-contained, e.g., where the number of appendix references is significantly reduced and proofs are at least sketched such that the reader is not forced to switch documents all the time.\n\n**Minor Comments**\n- In Dec-POMDPs (Section 2.1), policies select their actions by the history of past observations and actions. Conditioning only on observations is insufficient since they are not Markovian. The definition in Section 2.2 is correct, though.\n- Line 119: \u201cwas replaced\u201d - \u201c**is** replaced\u201d\n- Line 277: \u201cfour type of threats\u201d - \u201cfour type**s** of threats\u201d\n- The text size in Figure 2 is too small for printed versions."

Convergence is not ensured but experimentally\nthe approach shows great resilience against a spectrum of adversaries.\n\nThe paper makes some strong assumptions, like the fact that in each episode there is only one attacker. Other assumptions are consistency and sequential rationality, which are used to form an ex interim robust Markov perfect Bayesian equilibrium (RMPBE). With some additional assumptions, the existence of ex ante and ex interim RMPBE are guaranteed. For the ex interim equilibrium, the Q function can be written using the Bellman-type equation for the two Q functions, which the paper calls \"the robust Harsanyi-Bellman equation.\" With a few more assumptions, updating the value function via the Bayes rule guarantees convergence to the optimal value of Q.\n\nThe algorithm proposed is applied to different problems, a toy metrics game and some map problems. For the attacks, four types of threats are considered: non-oblivious adversaries, random agents, noisy observations, and transferred adversaries. The experimental results cover robustness over non-oblivious attacks and various types of attacks."

Without the Appendices the paper is incomplete.\n- The paper is hard to read, it assumes significant knowledge of the field and is full of acronyms and citations that break the flow of the text.\n\nAfter the discussion and the changes made to the paper, I reduced my criticism about convergence and increased the rating I gave for contribution. However, the presentation needs more work.  Many of the corrections made to the paper have grammar errors, like mismatches of singular/plural.

The study demonstrates that conventional robust cooperative MARL approaches only achieve an ex interim equilibrium and advances the concept of an ex post equilibrium for BARDec-POMDP, which it argues is superior under worst-case scenarios. To attain this ex post equilibrium, the study presents a novel actor-critic method named EPR-MAPPO. Testing on simple games, the LBF environment, and the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) illustrates that EPR-MAPPO outperforms standard models, showcasing resilience against four distinct threat categories."
