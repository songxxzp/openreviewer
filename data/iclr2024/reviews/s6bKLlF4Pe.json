I have the same question about transfer results, how important is the factor of  (1+\\gamma)/2. Why does it make the bound substantially looser? Even then we are comparing upper bounds which are not tight, so what is the correct way to make sense of this result?\n3. The experiments seem to present results that seem obvious. If weights are initialized closer to optimal weights convergence is fast and if the weight of transfer task is similar to prior task the transfer is fast. This is also similar to bounds we have seen for successor features in previous works."

If there are multiple rewards, then maximum of their corresponding value functions is simply meaningless and does not represent any physical concept regarding a new reward function (see the comments bellow). [This is OK when using SF as the $w_i$ corresponds to the current task and only $\\psi_j$ comes from some previous task.]\n\n- There were a number of other typos (a proof read aside from the points mentioned above is strongly suggested)."

For instance, you may define a total reward as the summation of all the task-level rewards, whose $\\pi^*$ and $Q^*$ would be different from the case where a total reward is a *weighted* sum of task-based rewards or some non-linear function of them. \n\n- Eq (13) is not a policy improvement operator (PI is to take an argmax of the current value to induce a new policy). \n\n- Last three lines of page 4 --> First, your reference to $Q^*$ is senseless. More importantly, this setup has nothing to do with your settings. Maximum of several $Q$ functions corresponding to various rewards may not even be a valid $Q$ function for a different reward signal. One can easily construct an MDP with say three tasks and two actions, where in a certain state, $a_1$ is the optimal action for task 3, while $\\max_{i\\in \\{ 1,2 \\} } Q_{i}$ give you action $a_2$. Indeed it is theoretically possible that $\\max_{i\\in \\{1,2\\}} Q_{i}$ gives you suboptimal action in *all* states. \n\n- Table 1 --> what is $\\phi_{i}(\\Theta^{*}_{i})$ ? $\\phi$ is supposed to be the feature vector. \n\n- Assumption 3 is unclear. Note that $\\pi(a|s) \\in [0,1]$, Hence, for sufficiently large $C$ this assumption is always true! Am I missing something?\n\n- Is (20) a s fair assumption? For most cases, $K$ would be a large number, so it looks like that the initial approximation of $\\psi_1$ must be already very good! Perhaps a better presentation could be that there has to be some pre-training for $\\psi_1$ before using this algorithm?"
