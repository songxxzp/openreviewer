                "value": "## Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based method for simulating the over-damped limit of Langevin dynamics, which reduces to Brownian dynamics when no acceleration is present. Contributions include the use of additional MLPs for predicting random diffusion and decoding edge latent as interacting forces to enforce linear momentum conservation. However, the paper has several significant shortcomings, including a lack of motivation, limited benchmarking, and insufficient definition and references. Due to these issues, I recommend rejecting the paper.\n\n## Detailed Comments\n\n### 1. Lack of Motivation and Benefits\n\nThe paper does not provide adequate motivation for replacing traditional simulation techniques for the over-damped Langevin system with GNNs. Given that the dataset is generated from simulators that can easily model such systems, the authors need to justify the utility of their approach. This could be in the form of improved simulation speed or to-reality accuracy, although the latter would require validation beyond simulated data.\n\n### 2. Lack of Definitions and References\n\n- In Figure 1, the term \"ohe(type)\" is used without definition or context, making it unclear to the reader.\n- The \"squareplus\" activation function is mentioned but not cited.\n\n### 3. Limited Benchmarking\n\nThe paper restricts its experiments to simple spring systems, providing only a narrow validation of its methodology. Prior work in this domain typically includes experiments on 3-4 different datasets to establish the method's applicability.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile the paper introduces a GNN-based method for simulating over-damped Langevin dynamics, it suffers from multiple critical flaws, including a lack of clear motivation, insufficient references, and limited benchmarking. These drawbacks severely compromise the paper's value and applicability. Therefore, I recommend rejecting this submission.\n\nThe authors should consider submitting to a workshop on this specific topic or, including more datasets to show the method's capability."

However, I\u2019m not an expert in partical-based systems and I\u2019m not expecting each accepted paper will include comparisons with all the popular models. More importantly, to show the benefits of the physics-informed inductive bias, it is worth comparing the other model with the same backbone structure + training with regularization on the physics violation. I appreciate the ablation study with BDGNN which essentially shares the same backbone model. But adding a comparison experiment by training BDGNN with regularizing on momentum conservation will better prove the power of inductive bias. \n\n2.\tRegarding the sde integrator, I\u2019m a bit concerned about the gradient stability due to the stochastic integral. Did you meet any issues when the random distribution of noise term leading to large error during back-propagation?
