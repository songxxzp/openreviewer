                "value": "**For Me to Improve My Score (Most to least important)**\n\nQ1: The only modular composition baseline in this paper is AdaptorFusion from 2021, which is quite old now and there have been other works that tackle the same problem from different angles that should act as baselines here. [1] Combining Modular Skills in Multitask Learning, [2] AdapterSoup: Weight Averaging to Improve Generalization of Pretrained Language Models, and [3] Multi-Head Adapter Routing for Cross-Task Generalization. And the baseline methods used in these papers. \n\nQ2: The experimental setup used in the paper can be significantly improved by studying this problem on good seq2seq zero-shot models like T0, or maybe LLaMA family models and then comparing the zero-shot performance, few-shot performance, and the performance obtained via this kind of composition of learned modules. \n\nQ3: How is the classification layer for the target task finetuned? In Table 1 and everywhere in the paper, it seems like you do not count these parameters when counting for the number of trainable parameters. Can you clarify this if the classifier parameters are also learned on each source task then this needs to be clarified throughout the paper. \n\n\n\n**Other Questions**\n\nQ4: The experiments in the paper should add IA3 () as a baseline. IA3 paper shares very high similarity to the proposed method, the ScaLEARN method is like adapting source task adapter modules using IA3 on a downstream task. Hence, for all the experiments, IA3 would be a good baseline as it would learn a lower number of parameters than ScaLearn. However, I don't suspect it to perform better than the presented method as it is leveraging source adaptors.\n\nQ5: At multiple places, the paper talks about how the scaling coefficient does not need to sum to 1 and I agree that for ScaLearn this might be the case however, I am not sure if there is enough evidence in the paper, to claim that this is how it should be for all other methods and this has been talked about at multiple places in the paper as a new finding. It can be that for the other methods having a constraint on summing to 1 might be better than not having it. Hence, this is a method-specific detail and should not be portrayed as a general finding that we should not have a summation constraint. I might have missed something here and I will willing to take this comment back in light of evidence.\n\n\nI looking forward to the rebuttal and will update my score if some of my main concerns are addressed. I really like the simplicity of the method however I would like it to be more rigorously tested against other baselines and experimental setups."

I would suggest authors use benchmarks such as CrossFit [2] to do a more large-scale analysis, where the transferring is more challenging as some source tasks can be relatively less related to the target tasks.\n- For the second stage during training, the output representations of multiple source adapters are scaled and combined, which reminds me of MoE (Mixture of Experts), where each source adapter corresponds to an expert. It is a well-known phenomenon that learnable MoE can lead to overfitting and collapse. However, in your method, it seems that this issue does not arise.
