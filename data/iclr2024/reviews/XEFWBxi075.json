The paper extends GradTree to a weighted tree ensemble, introduces softsign as a differentiable split function, and proposes a novel instance-wise weighting technique. The paper evaluates GRANDE on a predefined benchmark of 19 binary classification datasets and shows that it outperforms existing gradient-boosting and deep learning frameworks on most datasets The paper also demonstrates that GRANDE can learn simple and complex rules within a single model and provide local explanations based on instance-wise weights."

It would be valuable if the authors could include comparisons with other tree ensemble methods, such as random forest and extra trees.\n    \n3. Regarding the interpretability advantages of instance-wise weighting, could the authors provide a more comprehensive analysis? For instance, could they share statistics like the average node count of the highest-weighted estimators across all datasets? Furthermore, could the authors offer any theoretical insights into the benefits of instance-wise weighting?\n    \n4. Instance-wise weighting introduces a larger number of weights compared to estimator-wise weighting. Particularly when trees have greater depth (e.g., depth=10, 2^10 vs. 1 for one estimator), is there a significant impact on the training time due to the increased number of weights?"

Moreover, it is better to analysis the distribution of instance weights. For example:\n\na) Is it long-tailed?\n\nb) Are some trees very important for most of the samples?\n\n2. Too many hyperparameters, i.e. 11 are tuned for the proposed method. While the number of hyperparameters is no more than 4 for compared methods. We have reason to doubt that the performance gain is obtained by finer hyperparameter tuning. Could you reduce your number of hyperparameters to 4 and retrain your model for comparison?"

The tree ensemble layer: Differentiability meets conditional computation.\" by Hazimeh et al.\n\n\n\"WindTunnel: Towards Differentiable ML Pipelines Beyond a Single Model\" also seems closely related, though they only fine-tune existing tree models with gradient descent.\n\nI find it also somewhat confusing that it is claimed that gradient boosted models are the defacto state-of-the-art on tabular data, when there has been a lot of recent work on neural networks for tabular data, often outperforming gradient boosting models, see \"Well-tuned Simple Nets Excel on Tabular Datasets\" by Kadra for example. It would be great to include at least one other neural approach in the comparison.\n\n\nFor the evaluation, I would have expected performance profiles or critical difference diagrams based on AUC or AP, instead of the mean and rank (or in addition to it, though the unnormalized mean is not a good way to aggregate performance across datasets).\n\nOverall, I find the contribution beyond Borisov somewhat slim, though that work is not published at a conference.
