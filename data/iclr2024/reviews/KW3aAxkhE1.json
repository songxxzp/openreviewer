The pipeline first ensembles a group of images with similar targeted concepts and interleaves them with an LLM to construct a multimodal conversation. A post-refinement stage is performed to ensure the quality, with a golden seed set serving as the in-context candidate for the LLM generations.\nThe authors then propose an MIM training to incorporate the curated data, with representations from stable diffusion models, for augmenting LMs with the ability to interleave images between textual conversations."

What I would like to see is, could the models (MIM here) benefit further from tuning on these low-level vision instructions too, and at least achieve an on-par performance with existing works. That would strengthen the work significantly.\n- The criteria of the conversation might be too coarse and not informative. The criteria seems holistic but in Section 4 it is said per-turn utterance is inspected, too. How do they correlate?  Also, has the annotator agreement been computed and reported? How many are there and what are their relations to the research group?\n- A study of training conversations for tuning against the model performance is needed to gauge the contribution of the data."

                "value": "- **Major concern 1.** My first major concern lies in the novelty of the proposed textual exchange method for enabling LLMs to generate images. As far as I know, learning which segment of texts to use as the text inputs of text-to-image models was first proposed by Divter [1] (not cited or discussed). Divter proposes to learn the textural inputs by using a special token and constructed template. However, leveraging LLMs and diffusion models is different, but the contribution is still limited in this case. The authors are required to clarify the similarities and differences with Divter. On the other hand, using only textual conditions to generate images has its limitations when considering very long-context-based (e.g., interleaved documents) image generation or image-conditioned image generation (e.g., image2image translation, image edition, etc).\n- **Major concern 2.** My second major concern lies in the experimental evaluations. i) In Table 3, more commonly used NLP benchmarks like MMLU, HellaSwag, and WinoGrande should be conducted. In Table 5, what about the most commonly used metric FID results? In Table 6, I wonder about the zero-shot results of TextBind on VQAv2 and MM-Vet. ii) No ablation studies or in-depth discussions are presented. For example, what if no human-in-the-loop is used during dataset construction? What are the failure cases of TextBind, and why? What emerging properties could be explored by TextBind?\n- **Technical contribution.** The proposed method is simple, but the technical contribution is limited. The proposed multimodal LLM architecture is mainly based on previous work GILL. The only difference is the textural information exchange method which is good but somewhat incremental. Besides, the topic-aware image sampling is quite similar to the dataset constructed by PALI-X [2]. PALI-X constructs its own interleaved dataset Episodic WebLI by grouping image-text pairs. \n- **Unclearly supported claims.** The authors claim that the current multimodal instruction tuning methods lead to limited performance in open-world scenarios. However, there is a lack of analysis of TextBind's superiority in it. Besides, annotation-free may be overclaimed since human-in-the-loop definitely requires non-trivial annotation efforts.\n\n[1] Multimodal Dialogue Response Generation.

However, the core spirit of multimodal binding in the same embedding space as a modality-agnostic multimodal encoder is very different from this paper. I am quite confused about this. A name that better summarizes the work's idea is better than using one similar to an existing work while not very suitable.\n- Will the curated dataset be released to the public?\n- The dataset is constructed by using image descriptions with GPT-4, similar to LLaVA [4] and ChatCaptioner [5] (not cited). I wonder how is the hallucination problem of data and models in such progress since CLIP filtering can not guarantee the avoidance of such an issue. For example, can authors provide some failure cases of the dataset and test the model's hallucination capability? \n- Now we have GPT-4V, I am looking forward to the newly constructed dataset with GPT-4V (not required at this moment).\n- Since Q-Former is used, which may compress the visual signals, I wonder about the OCR performance of TextBind. For example, zero-shot results on TextVQA?\n- There are many concurrent works working in this direction. It would be good if these works were discussed in related work [6-10].\n- Minor: When the abbreviation `MIM` first appears in the paper, there is no explanation of the meanings.\n\nI am looking forward to the authors' response.\n\n[3] ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All.
