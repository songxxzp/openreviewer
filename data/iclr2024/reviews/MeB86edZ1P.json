This is an advantage over other projection-based methods. \n\nThe method only uses Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, which makes it suitable for neuromorphic hardware and also biologically plausible. There's a caveat for biological networks though: the lateral circuits are only active during the backward pass, and don't interfere with the forward one.

The lateral connectivity doesn't influence forward propagation (and it shouldn't due to projections), which might make it hard to implement with real neurons (not so sure about neuromorphic chips).\n3.

Although the paper uses Hebbian learning to achieve a pure neuronal operation method, it seems that the newly added subspace neurons do not participate in the model's forward process. If this is the case, then despite being a pure neuronal operation approach, it is essentially just an estimation method for orthogonal projection matrices.\n5.
