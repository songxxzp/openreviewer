While existing approach alternate between gradient descent and hard thresholding, it only works well in restricted settings. This paper makes the novel observation that large variance  of gradient estimation would result in conflict between ZO gradient and expansity of hard-thresholding operators. To resolve this issue, the authors prodive a variance reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm, and theoretically demonstrate that the variance-reduced algorithm is guaranteed to converge under standard assumptions and eliminates the requirement of the random direction sampled. Finally, the authors demonstrate the superiority of their algorithm by solving portfolio and adversatial attacks."

The main limitation of SZOHT is the conflict between ZO gradients and the expansivity of the hard-thresholding operator, which restricts the number of random directions. The proposed algorithm takes a novel perspective by considering the role of variance and introduces a generalized variance-reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm. The paper provides theoretical analysis and demonstrates that the new algorithm overcomes the limitations of SZOHT, resulting in improved convergence rates and broader applicability. The utility of the proposed method is illustrated through experiments on a ridge regression problem and black-box adversarial attacks."

It is crucial to include a comprehensive discussion on related works, especially regarding the variance-reduced ZO hard-thresholding algorithm and the variance reduction aspect.\n2. The paper suffers from a lack of necessary references, such as papers on SAGA, SARAH, and SVRG methods. When these methods are initially mentioned, it is essential to provide corresponding references. Additionally, there are errors in the appendix due to bibtex errors, which should be carefully reviewed and corrected.\n3. The presentation of baselines and experimental settings in the main text is not well-organized. It is recommended to reorganize this information to improve clarity, especially for readers who are unfamiliar with the baselines and adversarial attacks. Providing a cross-reference to the appendix can also help readers gain a better understanding.\n4. The introduction of SAGA-SZHT is missing from the paper, and it cannot be found. It is necessary to either locate the missing information or add it during the rebuttal phase.\n5. The authors propose three variants of VR-SZHT by utilizing SVRG, SARAH, and SAGA. It would be beneficial to summarize the advantages of each method in terms of memory storage and convergence rate, similar to what is found in the variance-reduction literature. Providing tables or summaries can help readers compare and understand the individual strengths of these methods.\n6. It is well-known that variance-reduction methods can improve the convergence rate of SGD from sublinear to linear under strongly convex and smoothness conditions. It would be interesting to clarify whether VR-SZHT exhibits a similar improvement compared to SZOHT. If there are notable differences, the authors should provide explanations or insights into the reasons behind these variations.\n7. I am curious to know if there are any additional technical challenges when integrating VR methods into SZOHT and proving the convergence rate, compared to applying VR methods to traditional finite-sum tasks. The response to this question will not impact my final evaluation of the paper's novelty. However, it will help me gain a better understanding of the paper's correctness and soundness."

During the rebuttal phase, I encourage the authors to resolve the mentioned concerns or correct any misunderstandings I may have. I suggest that the authors respond to my questions in multiple phases if they need much time to solve all the issues, allowing for further clarification if needed. For instance, it would be helpful to begin with the related works section and provide the algorithm for SAGA-SZHT as a priority. One suggestion is for the authors to incorporate the appendix into the current PDF version of the paper. This would enhance convenience for reviewers, allowing them to access all relevant information in a single document.\n\nBased on the current version of the paper, I have given it a borderline score. However, I will reconsider my evaluation based on the authors' responses during the rebuttal phase. I would like to defend my positive attitude towards the paper if my concerns and issues are effectively addressed."

From experiments in this paper, it seems that we have easy access to gradient information in all these applications. Therefore, why do we need to emphasize zeroth-order algorithms? The authors may consider some other applications where gradient information is hard to obtain. \n- Another concern is on the setting of L0 regularization. While there exist many other approaches on obtaining sparse solutions (e.g., LASSO), the authors may need to justify the necessity of using L0 regularization here.  \n- I am a bit confused on the key contribution of this work. The authors introduced two algorithms, pM-SZHT and VR-SZHT. What is the key difference of these two algorithms? Moreover, pM-SZHT is not compared in experiments, but SARAH/SAGA-SZHT is compared. This is also very confusing and may need some explanations. \n- It seems that SAGA-SZHT is missing in both the main text and appendix. Given its good performance in Table 1, I am a bit confused on why it is not properly introduced. Are there some errors? \n- Regarding experimental results, I am a bit confused by Figure 3. It seems that SZOHT converges faster than all other methods, but gradually becomes worse with more iterations. Some explanations may be needed here on why we need so many iterations after convergence. \n- Also, the evaluation of few-pixels universal adversarial attacks may seem a bit restricted with only 10 images from the same class. It would be better if the authors can use more images from different classes to further justify the effectiveness of proposed method."

                "value": "1. There are many symbol error as well as misleading notations in the paper, which requires further correction. E.g., the $k^*$ should be s in Assumption 1; no introduction of $\\mu$ in eq. 3; no explanation for $H_{2k}$ in page 3 when it appears at the first time; what's the meaning of J in page 5? how to get the i in page 5? and so on. This will make it hard for readers to understand the paper.\n2. More details and discussion for experiment section, e.g., the explanation on IZO and NHT in Fig.2,3, how to tell VR-SZHT is better in Table 1?\n3. More experiments may do a better job in supporting the advantages of the VR-SZHT algorithm. Currently, VR-SZHT seems to be even worse than baselines in some cases, e.g., Fig. 3.\n\nPS: it's really hard for reviewers to point out which equation when there is no equation number!"
