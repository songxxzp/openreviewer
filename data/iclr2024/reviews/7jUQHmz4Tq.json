Such contributions are integrated with domain adaptation strategy and final anomaly map reconstruction to consist of D3AD.  Authors experiment with D3AD in the VisA and BTAD datasets."

                "value": "The paper has various issues on soundness and significance. Specifically, I am confused about why the proposed method should work, given that the method comprises differences against existing diffusion-based anomaly detection. Further, unlike the authors insist, D3AD misses various benchmarks, competitive baselines, and even metrics for comparison. Below are my specific details on the issue I have on this paper.\n\n\n**Originality & Soundness & Clarity** \\\n(1) The paper overclaims about the domain adaptation technique. DDAD [1] also uses a similar objective to fine-tune the feature extractor. I would rather appreciate that the authors lower the tone.\\\n(2) The authors formulate reference $z_{\\hat{T}}$ as a multiplication of the latent without any noise addition. However, I do not find any support for why such guidance on the latent should work. The authors may elaborate on why this helps in detail via further analysis.\\\n(3) I do not understand how the binary search function $\\psi$ can choose the right time on the bin. Further details should be provided on how this works or at least introduce related concepts.\\\n(4) I am also confused about how the method constitutes a \"predefined histogram\" in Figure 3.\n\n**Significance**\\\n(1) The authors claim their methods show **state-of-the-art** performance but I doubt this is true. For example, [2] scores I-AUC of 97.6, P-AUC of 98.4, and PRO of 94.9 while this method scores 96.0/97.9/94.1. I don't feel that this method outperforms DDAD even since DDAD scores 99.3 I-AUC in the VisA dataset, which is somehow not shown in Table 1. The authors should compare all the baselines in previous conferences (e.g. ICML, CVPR, ICCV) to support this bold claim.\\\n(2) I also feel like three metrics least (I-AUROC, P-AUROC, p_PRO) should be compared as a whole in the major table (e.g. Table 1).\\\n(3) I am curious why the authors dropped the MvTec dataset for comparison since most anomaly detection algorithms are compared in the dataset. It is hard to assert that the method shows state-of-the-art performance without comparing the MvTecAD dataset in my opinion.\\\n(4) Even addressing this issue, I am confused about the gain of this paper since the proposed model uses a latent diffusion model, unlike the other diffusion-based methods.\\\n(5) Furthermore, diffusion-based methods show slow sampling speed due to computation-heavy U-Nets and multiple inference steps. It would be beneficial to note the computational cost of this method compared to competitive baselines.\\\n\n\n\nOverall, I do not find defining controllable operations in the latent space explicitly sound. Given such confusion and the excessive computational cost of diffusion-based anomaly detection methods, the paper's performance is not that competitive. This can be observed by simple baselines (e.g. PatchCore shows better P-AUROC in the VisA dataset) outperforming D3AD in some metrics while the most competitive benchmark has not been featured for comparison. This as a whole makes me skeptical of how this idea is surprising or valid as a competitive anomaly detection method. Hence, I lean for rejection."
