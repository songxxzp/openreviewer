This method, leveraging a time-dependent density ratio, offers improvements in both reweighting and score correction processes. One of its major contributions is making the weighting objective more manageable and drawing a theoretical link to traditional score-matching objectives that aim for unbiased distributions. Experiments shows TIW outperforms other baselines."

Utilization of importance sampling by time-dependent density ratio estimation (DRE) in diffusion models is novel and natural. DRE becomes more precise as $t$ becomes larger.\n3. I also appreciate the authors' efforts in providing toy examples and figures, which further makes the paper easy to understand.\n4.

I can see the arguments for time-dependent density ratio estimation the same as the ones for [1] (especially), [2], etc. Thus I suggest the authors make the citations and discussions accordingly. Nonetheless, I agree that the use case of DRE is different.\n2. In theory, the method works if $E_{x_0 \\sim p_{\\textrm{bias}}(x_0|x_t)} [\\nabla\\log p(x_t|x_0)] = \\nabla\\log p_{\\textrm{bias}}^t(x_t)$ and DRE's gradient actually contains $\\nabla\\log p_{\\textrm{data}}^t(x_t)$ information. Both require DRE to be really accurate, which, as the authors demonstrate, is reasonably true only for large $t$. Thus, might I suggest that the authors only train with Eq.10 for large $t$, and revert back (gradually) to standard diffusion training on the biased dataset for small $t$? The intuition is that for small $t$, the model only does denoising, which does not care about dataset biases (the model has already decided on the content it wants to generate). For an intuitive understanding, see Fig.2 in [3]. For a more theoretical explanation see [4], where small $t$'s score field is dominated by one sample, making the score for unbiased the same as biased here.\n3. In Fig.4, every method's performance peaks early and gets worse. This is unexpected for me. Could the authors provide an explanation?\n\n\n[1] Wang et al. \"Diffusion-gan: Training gans with diffusion.\" ICLR 2023.\n\n[2] Arjovsky et al. \"Towards principled methods for training generative adversarial networks.\" ICLR 2017.\n\n[3] Rombach et al. \"High-resolution image synthesis with latent diffusion models.\" CVPR 2022.\n\n[4] Xu et al. \"Stable target field for reduced variance score estimation in diffusion models.\" ICLR 2023."
