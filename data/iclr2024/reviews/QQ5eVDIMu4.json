                "value": "This paper presents GraphMETRO, a graph neural network with mixture-of-experts architecture for domain generalized graph learning. The idea of GraphMETRO is a two-level design. It first aims to identify the form of graph distribution change with a gating module, and then directs the graph to the corresponding experts that are responsible for the forms of graph distribution change. In addition, the experts should generate invariant features w.r.t to its graph distribution change. The authors design objective functions for each of the goals above. Experiments over real-world and synthetic datasets with distribution shift show the effectiveness of the proposed GraphMETRO."

Indeed, in real-world deployment of graph neural networks, we have to deal with shifting data (e.g. caused by temporal dynamics or cross-domain data). I also appreciate that the authors do not view distribution shifts as a whole, but try to decompose a distribution shift into different types of shifts. This brings extra insights to the problem of graph OOD generalization. \n\n2. The paper is well-presented, well-organized, and very easy to follow. \n\n3. The solution with mixture-of-experts is simple but sound and provides some interpretability to the distribution change. Indeed, mixture-of-experts is an established technique, but the authors made extra efforts to adapt MoE to the case of OOD generalization. The design that each expert is in charge of one type of distribution shift makes good use of MoE architecture, and a gating module that identifies the type of distribution changes adds interpretability to the whole method. In addition, adequate designs are made to ensure that the gating model recovers the right shift types, and the experts output invariant features."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. It is not clear how well the 5 designed distribution shifts can well cover real-world graph distribution shifts. The authors listed 5 distribution shifts in the paper (add edge, drop edge, feature noise, subgraph, drop nodes), but in fact there may be more graph distribution shifts than that. For example, there may be a systematic change in link preference (i.e. nodes tend to link with a different type of neighbors), adding malicious nodes (e.g. malicious users in a trading system). Maybe the authors can justify how well the 5 designed shifts can cover real-world distribution shifts.  \n\n2. It is not clear how the proposed GraphMETRO can handle imbalanced distribution shifts within the same graph. For example, it may happen that some subgraphs in the graph gets denser, while other subgraphs get sparser (e.g. some topics gain interest, while others lose).  How will GraphMETRO respond to this kind of shifts? \n\n3. It is not clear how graph pre-training can address the OOD generalization issue. Pre-training trains the model to observe a wide range of graphs and should be helpful in improving generalization. \n\n4. It may be good to discuss some previous works in graph transfer learning. Graph transfer learning addresses the problem that the source graph has a different distribution with the target graph, but the target graph should be given beforehand and is thus less difficult than the problem in this paper. Nevertheless, it may be good to discuss them and clarify the differences, e.g. (Zhang et al. 2019), (Wu et al. 2020). \n\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptive Graph Convolutional Networks. Wu et al.

However, it is unclear whether the set of transformations used in the experiments is enough to cover complex distributions causing the distribution shift.\n- Moreover, most of the transformation requires a set of hyperparameters, e.g., dropout probability. However, each mixture only models a single instance of the transformation but not the entire class of transformations. Given that the hyperparameters are selected via the validation set, there is no evidence that the same configurations can work for the test set since it may caused by the different hyperparameters of the same transformation type.\n- This work only considers the distribution shift in the graph structure but not in the labels."

Contrary to the suggestion that graph shift heterogeneity is under-explored, numerous studies have delved into learning the \"environment generators\" for GNNs to detect graph shifts, as exemplified by [https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02466]. Other works have focused on learning shift-specific transformations, such as [https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02843]. Consequently, there exists a wide spectrum of approaches to tackle graph shift heterogeneity. The choice of approach in this paper, especially the emphasis on MOE, requires a more detailed and robust justification to elucidate its relevance and significance.\n\n- The presented assumption seems overly broad and lacks specificity. Additionally, the architectural design appears to be somewhat arbitrary. Consequently, it's challenging to discern the functionality, its underlying mechanism, and its improvements over existing methods.\n\n- The proposal is insufficient in its details, particularly concerning the implementation of specific model architectures, stochastic transformation, and the optimization process. Given the inclusion of shift learning midway and data augmentation initially, one would expect a more intricate optimization strategy than standard routines."
