In my understanding, IFA loss plays similar role as the first term in SNC loss, while FD loss plays the similar role as the second term of SNC loss (here FD loss may be better as it quantifies the similarity degrees between different categories). I am just wondering what if only using FD and IFA losses for adaptation.\n\n\n\n- In Fig. 2, the results show that the proposed method can not improve SHOT, while in AaD it indicates that SHOT is actually conducting similar operation as NRC and AaD. Do authors have clear explanation about the phenomenon, is it due to the pseudo labeling used in SHOT?\n\n- In Fig. 3, with only FD or IFA on SNC will deteriorate the performance. The authors posit some hypothesis for explanation, while I think there may need more results on several other datasets to prove the assumption. By the way, I think there is no information we could get from Fig. 3(b), since it is neither not consistent with the corresponding accuracy, nor cable to guide the hyperparameter tuning.\n\n- There are two extra hyperparameters for FD and IFA losses, and there seems no ablation study for those hyperparameters. In the paper, it mentioned that $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are set to different values for different dataset. I conjecture they may be sensitive on some datasets and hard to tune in the unsupervised way."

The proposed method aims to harness the advantages of data augmentation while mitigating the drawbacks associated with relying on prior knowledge of class-preserving transformations and the increased memory and computational demands. SF(DA)^2 comprises three key components: Spectral Neighborhood Clustering (SNC) loss, Implicit Feature Augmentation (IFA) loss, and Features Disentanglement (FD) loss. The SNC loss is designed to cluster the target data in the prediction space, the IFA loss emulates the effects of augmented features without imposing additional computation and memory overhead, and the FD loss captures distinct class semantic information along diverse directions. Rigorous experimentation on various benchmarks verifies that the proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in source-free domain adaptation."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(1)\tWhat are the differences between the proposed SNC loss and the loss function in the existing AaD [1]? As far as I know, the purpose of the loss in AaD is to encourage similar neighbors to be close to each other and dissimilar neighbors to be far apart within a batch. This is similar to the SNC loss proposed in this paper. The author needs to clarify the differences between these two loss functions.\n\n(2)\tAre the estimated covariance matrices accurate in the IFA and FD losses, given the domain shift between the source and target domains? The estimation of these matrices relies on the output probabilities of the target data. However, this estimation process may introduce biases, especially when there are significant dissimilarities between the classes in the target domain and those in the source domain. As a result, the probabilities associated with these classes in the target domain, as generated by the source domain model, may be greatly reduced. Consequently, there is a potential risk of losing the capability to effectively learn these specific classes during the subsequent learning process, presenting a challenge to rectify the situation.\n\n(3)\tIFA operations have shown promise as a universally applicable data augmentation technique in unsupervised tasks. Can IFA be applied to other existing unsupervised tasks? Can you provide examples to validate its effectiveness?\n\n(4)\tTwo questions regarding the experiment:\n(a) In VisDA, Domain-Net, and PointDA-10 datasets, IFA loss has a weight of 1e-4, while FD loss has a weight of 10, resulting in a limited impact of IFA loss on the training process compared to FD loss. Can the inclusion of the other two datasets, apart from the VisDA-Rust task, demonstrate the significance of this new data augmentation technique? \n(b) Why are there no comparisons of NRC and AaD methods on the DomainNet dataset? Similarly, why are the results of AaD not compared on the PointDA-10 dataset? \n\n(5)\tIn the Introduction, the authors mention that recent studies have used data augmentation techniques to improve adaptation performance. However, there is a lack of more relevant work cited, such as [2] and [3].\n\n[1] Yang, S., Jui, S., & van de Weijer, J. (2022).

Motivated by the two assumptions, the authors naturally constructed an augmentation graph within the feature space. Initially, the augmentation graph is formed based on neighboring features. Subsequently, it is harnessed to identify clusters within the feature space using the SNC loss. With high-quality clusters, target features are implicitly augmented by an EFA loss as an upper bound of the first term of SNC loss instead of directly sampling from Gaussian distribution. Considering similar categories, feature space is further disentangled by maximizing cosine distances, leading to preserved class semantics. Experiments and analysis were conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method."
