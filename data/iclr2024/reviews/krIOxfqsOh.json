How did you train MaskMA? Is it similar to supervised learning in a Decision transformer? \n2. What is the input for each agent? I can see the description \"includes unit type, position, health, shield, and so on\". But do you have pixel input for each agent as shown in Figure 2? What encoder did you use for the pixel input? \n3. The zero-shot performance seems to be very impressive. But why it can generalized across different environments? In recent pretraining works for embodied AI, their models can generalize because they have natural language instructions and they learn on multiple skills and objects, making them able to generalize to unseen combinations of seen skills and seen objects. I was wondering what the foundation models in MaskMA learned, and why it can generalize so well with zero-shot learning. \n4. Do you have the map information? Is the map information introduced as context for different tasks? Does the map information really make a difference in agents' decisions? Or is the agent's decision mainly based on the information of other units? If so, I think a map is not that important, and the generalization ability can be explained by the masking mechanism to deal with varying numbers of different other agents/units. \n5. The action representation is good for starcraft, where units interact with each other through actions, but may not be general to other MARL environments.\nI will consider raising my score if all the questions are addressed."

GAR divides the action space into actions toward self-information and actions related to other entities, allowing MaskMA to handle tasks with varying agent numbers and action spaces. \nThe experiment results are impressive. A single model pretrained on 11 training maps achieves a 77.8% zero-shot win rate on 60 unseen test maps. The method also shows effective generalization in various downstream tasks."

The main architecture is based on Transformer with two key components Mask-based Collaborative Learning Strategy (MCLS) and Generalizable Action Representation (GAR).  MCLS is essentially a random mask on the attention matrix which is more like a multi-task pretraining trick which can provide multiple battle scenarios during pretraining. The idea of GAR to group actions is common, and GAR also lacks certain theoretical explanations.\n\n**Experiment:** Compared algos only contain MADT which is insufficient. Except for zero-shot generation experiment, the results in section *PERFORMANCE ON DOWNSTREAM TASKS* are lack of comparision with other alogs and settings. For example, in *Table 5*, including a Marine in the 1/5th of the episode results in 80% win rate, however, without comparision, it is difficult to tell whether the results are good enough.\n\n**Writing:** Overall, the writing of this paper can convey clear ideas. But there are a few parts need to be improve. First, Figures 1 and 2 are not referenced in the paper, which is confusing. Second, matrix J2 in section 3.2 has no shape description. And also it will be better to explain which sepcific part being masked after the maths to help reader to understand. Third, Figure 1 doesn't show the training part, like interaction with envs and the gradients flow. Last but not least, figures and tables are poorly laid out, often far from the text that references them."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The novelty of this paper is somewhat limited, as random masking has been used previously in Bert and some RL tasks [1]. The GAR component appears to address only the issue of variable action spaces and incorporates some domain knowledge from StarCraft for action grouping. The baseline comparisons in the article are also limited, considering only Transformer models in sequence modeling and not directly comparing with related works that employ attention mechanisms, although they are discussed in the related work section, such as Uni[Mask], UPDeT, and ASN, which could be applicable to this paper's setting.\n\nAnother major concern is that, despite the large number of test environments, the experimental domain is quite narrow, i.e., only on SMAC. It would be beneficial to conduct supplementary tests in commonly used environments like Google Research Football (GRF). The paper does not demonstrate the connection and differences between the selected tasks and the tasks for generalization tests, such as why specifically these 11 tasks were chosen and what characteristics the 60 test tasks have, or how they differ from the selected tasks. I think foundation models are an important research direction, and the paper's demonstration of zero-shot generalization is impressive in terms of the number of training and testing tasks. However, the number of unseen tasks is not the most crucial metric. A more careful analysis of how tasks are chosen and on which conditions zero-shot generalization ability can be achieved would make the paper more solid.\n\nAdditionally, the selection of downstream tasks appears somewhat arbitrary, also without clear reasoning for the choice of corresponding maps (e.g., 8m vs 9m, 7m vs 9m).\n\n\n\nIn terms of writing, the notation in the paper may incur ambiguity, particularly in Section 3.2, where some notation are not clearly-defined (as detailed in the question part). The organization of figures and tables is somewhat chaotic, with some tables located several pages away from the relevant text, requiring back-and-forth scrolling. Besides, it would be better if the authors could use bold or other emphasis to highlight results in the tables.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n1. *Masked Trajectory Models for Prediction, Representation, and Control.* ICML 2023"

                "value": "1. Why were these 11 tasks chosen instead of others? What is the relationship between these tasks and the 60 unseen tasks tested?\n2. Some works in the related work section, such as Uni[mask] and UPDeT, seem to be directly applicable to this paper's setting; why were they not included in the comparisons?\n3. Why were these particular downstream tasks chosen to demonstrate the benefits of MaskMA, and why were only the maps 8m vs 9m and 7m vs 9m used instead of others?\n4. I noticed that the number of expert trajectories used is 10k or 50k (averaging about 18k according to the authors), which seems several times more than the 2k trajectories used in ODIS. Is this amount excessive, or how should the number of trajectories be chosen?\n5. Section 3 states \"Such an independent learning pipeline leads to an increase in computational complexity of $O(N^3)$\"; why is the complexity $O(N^3)$?\n6. In Section 3.2, each $J_1$ is an $N \\times N$ matrix; how is the diagonal matrix $m_1\\$ constructed with the $\\mathtt{Diag}$ operation, and do the subsequent disjunction and conjunction symbols correspond directly to the binary \"or\" and \"and\" operations for 0-1 operations? If so, it is suggested to explain more to avoid ambiguity.\n7. In the MaskMA and the Transformer structure presented in this paper, are the observations and actions of teammates included as inputs? If so, how is the order of agents determined?\n8. Why were 4 seeds used in the experiments? The common practice is to use 5 or 10 seeds in SMAC.\n9. In the ablation study of the number of pretraining maps, which 2, 5, or 8 maps were used, and were the same 60 unseen tasks always the test set?\n10. According to the experimental results in Table 6, +MCLS actually reduced performance in CE mode, while GAR showed significant improvement. Is there any in-depth analysis?"

Given these related methods (in addition to MaskDP and Uni[MASK] in Section 2), it is unclear how new the idea of MCLS (i.e., randomly making part of the units in $s^t$) is. \n2. GAR requires prior knowledge about which actions affect the environment and which actions correspond to agent interactions, so GAR is not completely model-free. \n3. Only MADT is compared as a baseline. It is also unclear whether MADT is a SOTA method given that the work was published in 2021. Adding more baselines (including UPDeT as mentioned in Section 2) could help justify whether MaskMA achieves SOTA zero-shot MARL performance. Also, having more than one benchmark domain (other than SMAC) would make the experimental result more strong. \n\nReferences:  \nBowen Cheng, Ishan Misra, Alexander G.

                "value": "This paper presents a multi-agent RL method that learns by masking parts of a global state instead of training separate policies that take input states, which also includes a generalizable action representation technique that separately represents actions that involve multi-entity interaction from actions that does not. Experiments are conducted mainly on SMAC environment where the proposed method is compared against the baseline MADT that transforms multi-agent data to single-agent data."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- I'm not an expert in this area so not sure on this point, but there is only one baseline and the reason of only reporting the performance of sole baseline is not clear from the paper. Even if it's not a fair comparison, it could be nice to include other baseline performances and clearly explaining the results can be helpful.\n- In terms of presentation this paper could be improved by better locating the figures and tables. Current arrangement requires the readers to scroll up and down quite a lot, which harms the readability.\n- There are several typos, like casual -> causal, missing . in ACE (Li et al., 2022) This, not consistent usage of italic in FC, inconsistent use of . in paragraph (e.g., Action Representation.)."
