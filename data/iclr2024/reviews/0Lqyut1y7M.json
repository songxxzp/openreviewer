                "value": "The paper views INR fitting through the lens of sampling theory and shows that the sinc activation function is particularly amenable due to two properties: shifted sinc functions form a linearly independent basis in the space of bandlimited functions, and they also form a partition of unity in this space. The authors show that these two conditions are uniquely satisfied by sinc, and that existing activation functions only satisfy at most the first property. These two conditions allow one to construct an INR with just a single hidden layer and sinc activation that can approximate any L^2 function to arbitrary accuracy. The authors empirically demonstrate that this simple method achieves superior performance on radiance field fitting and dynamical system fitting."

When the paper involves this much theory, it is particularly important for the presentation to be clear and to offer graphics / intuition when possible. In particular, everything from def 3.5 to lemma 3.8 seems to have the sole purpose of demonstrating the importance of the PUC condition in bridging the gap between V(F) and L^2(R), but after reading it I still don't have an intuitive understanding of how the PUC condition enables this (I believe that only if I carefully followed the proofs in the appendix would I understand this). This lack of intuition also makes it difficult to think critically about the connection between the theory and behaviors of the different activations in practice. (e.g. to what extent is the performance of ReLU activations actually limited by them not forming a Riesz basis?) Since this subsection (def 3.5 to lemma 3.8) constitutes 1.5 pages of very dense material, I think the authors should move some of this to the appendix and focus on building intuition. One way of doing that would be to answer: \"what happens if you try to fit a function in L^2(R) but not in V(F) with a weak Riesz basis vs. a strong basis?\" and offer a simple graphical demonstration with such a toy function.\nThere are also a few notational problems (see questions section below for some examples) that make the theory part a little harder to read."

While it is clear that the main selling point of the paper is the technical analysis, the experimental presentation can be more thoroughly presented (even if it is short). Fig. 1 would have us believe that for the dataset described, the proposed method yields the best overall performance. Very little additional discussion is provided.

                "value": "Unfortunately, the brilliance of the ideas is significantly diminished by the unacceptably low quality of writing. Concretely, the paper looks and reads like a draft that is 80-90% complete.\n\nIn particular:\n- There are countless typos in the paper, including undefined notation, which makes parsing the contents quite challenging. For example, I believe that in the paragraph below Eq 5, T is undefined, and I think it should be 1/Omega instead. Similarly, there's an inequality sign missing in the bound on $|\\varepsilon_{corr}|$ in Thm 3.7.\n- This is an even more serious problem in the appendix, where it appears that the content wasn't even re-read once, as there are gross typos (including some mathematical ones) in every second to third sentence. For example:\n  - Appendix A (which is also unreferenced in the main text) has several typos of the form $10^20$ instead of $10^{20}$\n  - The title of Appendix B is \"proof of theorems in Sec 3.2\", but the theorems are stated in Sec 3.3\n- The notation should be optimized significantly. As the prime example, parsing notation like $\\bar{\\hat{\\tilde{F}}}$ is quite challenging.\n- The figures are low-quality, and their legends, axis labels, and axis ticks are completely unreadable.\n- Sections 4.3.1 and 5 are extremely terse and poorly explained. Several concepts are not defined or referenced (e.g., spectral derivatives), and a reader like me, who's unfamiliar with dynamical systems, will get completely lost.\n- The Related Works section is far too technical at the beginning of the paper. I suggest the authors move it to the end of the paper and also simplify its content.\n- As a more minor point, please use `\\sin` and `\\mathrm{sinc}`; or ideally, define `\\sinc` using `\\DeclareMathOperator{\\sinc}{\\mathrm{sinc}}`.\n\nFurthermore, I found the proofs of Prop 3.3, Thm 3.7, and Lemma 3.8 in Appendix B to be much too terse for a machine learning venue. For a reader unfamiliar with functional analysis, the proofs are completely inaccessible. Furthermore, the proofs that the translates of the activation functions studied form a weak Riesz basis, i.e., that they fulfill condition 1 in Def 3.1, are missing.\n\nE.g., Prop 3.3 could be clarified significantly by stating and referencing the Poisson summation formula explicitly and stating that an equivalent condition for the integer translates of $F \\in L_2(\\mathbb{R})$ to form a Riesz basis is that $A \\leq \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} |\\hat{F}(\\omega + 2\\pi k|^2 \\leq B$ where $\\hat{F}$ is the Fourier transform of $F$, which can be shown in a couple of lines.\n\nFinally, I think the author's claim that $\\mathrm{sinc}$ is optimal among INR activations is misleading because they do not state a clear optimality condition with respect to which the claim holds. What the authors mean is that $\\mathrm{sinc}$ is the only activation among the ones they study for which their universal approximation theorem holds. I think the authors should clarify this in the text. \n\nIf the authors improve the writing by the end of the rebuttal period, I will be happy to recommend acceptance for the paper."

Are there particular scenarios where traditional activation functions might outperform sinc?\n\n**Q2:** Considering that state-of-the-art INRs often employ positional encoding (which by themselves can be deemed as an activation function), how does the sinc activation function interact with common positional encodings like random Fourier features[1] or sinusoidal encodings[2]? Moreover, is there a positional encoding strategy that effectively incorporates the sinc function?\n\n\n[1] Tancik, Matthew, et al. \"Fourier features let networks learn high frequency functions in low dimensional domains.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 7537-7547.\n\n\n[2] Vaswani, Ashish, et al. \"Attention is all you need.\" Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017)."
