It is necessary to describe the main contributions of the study and clearly explain how the existing challenges are addressed. Furthermore, as a key technology involved in this research, TRW should be introduced with more details, such as what specific temporal features are used and how they interact with spatial features, if applicable. Additionally, it is not clear which 7 features are extracted and why they were selected. Were they chosen based on findings from other existing studies? An example to demonstrate a sample and how the spatial and temporal patterns are involved would be helpful. \n\n+ Regarding the ground truth\n\nAfter reading the Empirical Analysis section, it feels that the anomaly detection results are not validated against any ground truth. In other words, it is unclear whether the detected anomalies represent actual threats. Furthermore, from the description stating, \"by changing the threshold, far more anomalies could be detected,\" it appears that the accuracy of anomaly detection depends on the chosen threshold. This raises the question of how to determine the threshold in practical applications.\n\n+ Lack of comparison with existing approaches\n\nAs mentioned in the Introduction section, there are numerous related studies that employ various sampling methods. Liu et al. (2023) is introduced as an approach that \"combines historical information over time\". However, none of these approaches is considered as a benchmark method. It would be better and necessary to provide more experimental results demonstrating that the proposed approach offers a superior solution."

Although the application is novel, the idea of using temporal information to build graphs (and weighted adjacency matrix) is not new in pattern recognition and machine learning areas. In addition, the proposed method seems straightforward.\n2. Lack of ablation experiment: While the paper presents the theoretical benefits of the TRW-GCN framework, there is a need for empirical evaluation to demonstrate its tangible benefits. Comparing the performance of GCN with and without TRW on a temporal dataset would provide more evidence of the model's effectiveness.\n3. Lack of intuitive visualization of experimental results: The paper presents experimental results to demonstrate the superiority of the TRW-GCN framework, but the visualizations and figures provided are not clear and do not effectively convey the findings. The authors should consider improving the clarity and quality of the figures to make the experimental results more intuitive and easier to interpret."

Another example is the use of \"Potential Conclusions\" in Section 1.\n3) The authors do not use proper baselines in the experiments. There are multiple GNN-based anomaly detection algorithms that have been proposed in the literature. None of them appeared in the experiment.\n4) The evaluation metrics used by the authors are not appropriate for comparison.
