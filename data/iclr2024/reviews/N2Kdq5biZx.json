The paper proposes a way to measure the out-of-distribution-ness using conditional entropy bottleneck. Finally the paper compares the proposed algorithm with other baselines on a rage of offline-to-online benchmarks."

The paper proposes a natural way to address the oto RL problem: during the online fine-tuning stage, performing exploration to cover the unexplored region (thus out-of-distribution) seems a very reasonable strategy, and the paper suggests that one should also perform the exploration in a more careful manner (taking the return into account), which is a reasonable heuristic in practice. \n\n2. The proposed algorithm is easy to understand and extensible (for a wide range of offline RL methods). \n\n3. The empirical performance seems strong."

Although there seems no issue with the technical part of the paper, I do want to bring the attention to a recent paper: Reward-agnostic Fine-tuning: Provable Statistical Benefits of Hybrid Reinforcement Learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10282). I believe this paper, from the theory perspective, proposes the same intuition as the current paper: after running model-based offline RL on the offline dataset, one could use the model to estimate the occupancy measure of the offline policy, and thus have the knowledge of the uncovered directions from the offline data, and during online fine-tuning, one could use exploration to collect the data in the remaining directions. To me the current paper shares a lot of intuition with this earlier paper, minus many empirical considerations, which are also good contributions. \n\n2. Other than CEB, there might be many other methods for measuring the out-of-distributioness. It would improve the paper if there are more ablations. \n\n3. The experiment section seems to miss of of the benchmarks that are tested in cal-QL. \n\n4. Minor point: in the related work section, two cited paper (Nair et al., 2020 and Song et al., 2023) seem to be more general than just using expert demonstration. I believe they also use the more general offline data (the same as the ot2 setting)."

In recent years, there has been rapid development in the field of offline-to-online RL, with numerous relevant works published. It is crucial for the authors to include and discuss these more recent works in the related works section, like AWAC[1], E2O[2], PROTO[3], SUNG[4] and PEX[5].\n3.
