It remains unclear if the considered multi-mode training objective considered in this submission are a better choice compared to these prior works. In particular, neural process models are often also quantitatively evaluated on image impainting tasks similarly to Sec. 4.1.\n\nAny quantitative evaluation (and in relation to prior works, e.g. [5]) of the BigLearn-GAN model seems missing. The submission claims that BigLearn-GAN yields \u2018generation/completion capabilities with learned adaptive generation diversity\u2019. Since GANs often suffer from mode collapse, it is not clear to me how their approach avoids this issue to achieve diverse sample generation.  \n\nMultimodal generative models (VAEs, etc.) have often been used to \u2018unify classification and generation\u2019 as in Sect. 4.3 and it remains unclear to me if the suggested approach improves such approaches (using common quantitative multi-modal evaluation measures). \n\n\n[1] Garnelo, Marta, et al. \"Conditional neural processes.\" International conference on machine learning.
