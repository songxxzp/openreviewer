It introduces the  PRELIMINARIES in section 3 with some equations. But it seems that section 3 is not necessary as the equations are not used and the attacks are easy to follow. Since it puts many information to the appendix, maybe it is better to move some important information such as experimental results to the main paper instead of section 3.\n\nThere may be some problems with the experimental setting. In table 2, without defense (the 'None' row),  some attacks does not achieve high successful attack rate with low robust accuracy. For example, the robust accuracy of NES for unprotected model is 80%, similarly, Boundary with 84.8%, HopSkipJump with 86.3% on Imagenet. It means that without any defenses, the attacks are quite weak. The setting may have some problems so that the attacks does not perform well. Comparing with these weak attacks due to inappropriate setting, its better performance does not mean that the proposed method is really better. And sometimes the proposed method is not the best compared the baselines. The experiments do not seem to be solid. \n\nFor black-box models, transfer attack is often adopted an attack method, to generate adversarial examples with white-box substitute model and transfer the examples to attack the black-box model. It is better to test the performance under transfer attack. \n\nIt mainly discusses the black-box model. But the method is general and it can be applied for white-box models. What is its performance if the model is white-box? It is better to provide more insights for the proposed method.\n\nIt mentions that the proposed method is more efficient and can achieve some speedup. Maybe it is better to provide some detailed complexity computation or discussion to help better understanding why it is more efficient. Besides, it seems that it needs to train multiple purifiers. It may add some additional training efforts and make the training more complex. It is better to discuss the training complexity. \n\nIt is better to experiment with more architectures. Currently it only shows the results of WideResNet-28-10 for CIFAR and ResNet-50 for ImageNet. More results on other architectures can help better demonstrate the generalization of the proposed method."

But the technical contribution does not directly serve the goal: you can also use it to increase the robustness against white-box attacks. In 4.1, the motivation is claimed to be an ensemble multiple purifier & adversarial examples are in low-D manifold, which is about the general defense for all attacks, not motivated for query-based attacks.\n\n2.

The motivation is clear now: For a defense without hurting accuracy, purification is induced with theoretical analysis that multiple purifiers are needed. To address the efficiency issue of ensembling multiple purifiers, the proposed method is presented. But my concerns remain because the method does NOT hurt the minimum accuracy as claimed, especially for low-res images when the purification blurs the input. According to the new results, 86% accuracy for CIFAR-10 is obtained, which is lower than adversarial training. The reported \"random noise input\" clean accuracy (78%) is also significantly lower than the original paper (93.6%). Therefore, I keep my score."
