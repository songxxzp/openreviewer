ContSup is motivated by the phenomenon of short-sight task-relevant information loss, i.e., in the earlier modules, introducing local supervision signals tend to encourage the loss of important task-relevant information, such that the performance of later modules is limited by the insufficiently informative inputs. The authors propose to alleviate this problem by incorporating context supply between isolated modules to compensate for information loss. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, and STL-10."

Notably, given that ImageNet is one of the most reasonable benchmarks to evaluate deep learning algorithms, the real contributions of this paper are still questionable.\n2. According to Table 10, ContSup increases the inference cost significantly. I think this is an important problem. This issue is especially serious when K is large, where the authors claim that ContSup is mainly useful for. The comparisons with almost all the baselines are unfair, since the model used by ContSup is enlarged significantly. In other words, the authors think ContSup is mainly useful when K is large, but the comparisons are extremely unfair in these cases. In contrast, when K is small, the gains of ContSup are very marginal (in fact, here, the comparisons are still unfair).\n3. In terms of Table 10, the results of additional FLOPs during inference should also be provided. Both Table 10 and these new results should be highlighted in the main text.\n4. I politely disagree with the authors on the training cost (Table 12). Other baselines (e.g., DGL, InfoPro) can also use light auxiliary module designs. ContSup also needs to adjust hyper-parameters (e.g., the architecture of auxiliary nets)."

Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme."

This seems to violate the original objective of GLL. ii) ContSup introduces new modules to the original architecture which may increase the inference latency.\n\n\n(W2) [Evaluation] One of the main goals of GLL is to reduce the computing and memory overheads when training large models on large datasets. In the paper, ContSup is evaluated only on smaller benchmarks, i.e.CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10, which may not fully represent its efficacy. The authors are encouraged to extend the evaluations to larger benchmarks such as ImageNet1k, to better assess ContSup\u2019s scalability and potential impact. Moreover, in line with (W1), it would be beneficial to include an analysis of the inference latency.\n\n\nOverall, the reviewer appreciates the authors\u2019 exploration on GLL and the valuable analysis on the performance bottleneck. However, the reviewer has concerns about the extra training and inference overheads introduced by the proposed method, and believe that the paper could benefit from more comprehensive evaluations. At this moment, the reviewer rates the paper as marginally below the acceptance threshold."
