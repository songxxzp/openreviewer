There are excitatory and inhibitory synapses and the E-I balance is one of the most important features in biological neurons. This paper totally abandons weights and takes them as 1, which is far from reality. While temporal delay is an important feature for SNNs, there is no reason to abandon weights.\n\n2. This paper claims that the proposed ETDP is biologically plausible. Is there any reference, e.g., evidence in neuroscience, supporting such claim? As far as I know, we have no detailed evidence on how biological neurons learn delays as models for learning weights such as STDP. There are also previous methods to learn delays and the comparison between the proposed method and these methods is not discussed.\n\n3. In the paper, it is claimed that \u201cthese foundations can be easily generalized to the DSNN with multiple hidden layers by simply updating the forward and reverse timing terms\u201d. However, this seems highly non-trivial. For multi-layer networks with gradient-based supervised learning, it usually involves backpropagation across layers for credit assignment, which is often considered biologically implausible. It is unclear how the proposed method can solve such problem.\n\n4. The experiments are toy and results are relatively poor. The proposed model and algorithm do not reach better STDP results. It is unclear what is the advantage of the proposed method."

However, the performance of this proposed method seems to be worse off than current LIF SNNs with STDP learning. It would be interesting if the authors could give some more motivation and intuition of using such delayed SNNs and ETDP and why that will be better than current methods\n\nFinally the experiments done in the paper are shown in simple datasets (XOR, Iris), and the proposed method fails to outperform current methods on these simple datasets too.

The authors use dendrite and the axon delay in the SNN - it would be good to show the ablation study of the role each of these two delays independently play. \n\n4. It would be interesting if the authors could add a discussion on what new modes of computation/ advantages this proposed method brings to the table.\n\n5.

The authors have only conducted experiments on the XOR problem, IRIS dataset, and the MNIST/FashionMNIST datasets. For the FashionMNIST dataset, only the accuracy is reported in the paper, without any other benchmark results for comparison. An accuracy of 96.6% on the MNIST dataset is not very compelling, especially when, as the authors mention in Tab.2, previous works have achieved better accuracy than ETDP.
