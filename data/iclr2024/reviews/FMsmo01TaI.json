Moreover, the introduced method hasn't been empirically tested or combined with tactile sensors in real-world experiments, which is a missing link for comprehensive validation.\n2. The ViT model, as utilized, is computationally intensive and has a propensity to overfit to specific problems. The potential benefits of ViT's self-supervised pre-training techniques, such as MAE, ought to be realized across a diverse range of datasets or environments. Given the constraints observed in the study\u2014limited tasks, a restricted set of objects, and minimal variations in background textures\u2014it's challenging to fully endorse the promise of the proposed approach.\n3. As discerned from Figure 6, there's an inconsistency in the results between the baseline and the proposed method across various tasks. This discrepancy muddles the clarity needed to conclusively determine the efficacy of the proposed method. It would be advisable to extend the scope by implementing over 10 distinct tasks and undertaking comprehensive statistical analyses to more convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness."

                "value": "1. The paper ignores several different related works, both in terms of tactile sensors used for robotics, and machine learning approaches that use touch as a modality for manipulation tasks. Here are some missing papers that should be discussed:\n\n         a) robot learning papers with tactile data [1,2] these papers show real-robot dexterous manipulation tasks with either tactile data along or with both vision and tactile data (followed by RL with sim2real transfer)\n         b) versatile tactile sensors for real-world manipulation [3] \n\n2. The simulation results are interesting in terms of the same algorithm being able to learn policies for very different tasks (as mentioned in the strengths) but it is unclear to me why experiment with only three tasks? Most reinforcement learning in simulation papers show results on a large number of environments, and this is important to understand the capabilities of the proposed approach, without over-indexing on a particular environment. \n\n3. There are no external baselines compared against. All the comparisons are with variants of the proposed M3L algorithm. The related works in representation learning that use vision-only observations, including papers that do pre-training for representation learning are relevant for empirical comparisons (for example [4,5])\n\n4. The introduction mentions \"M3L demonstrates better zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and variations of\nthe task scene\" however the experiments show only very weak generalization to minor changes in the object (in particular mass, damping, friction variations). Hence the claim is not really substantiated in my understanding. It is important to show generalization to actually different objects (for example with geometric variations like shape and size, in addition to the current variations). Also, the results should evaluate this for a number of different objects and not just a single new object, in order for the conclusions to be statistically significant.  \n\n\n[1] Qi, Haozhi, Brent Yi, Sudharshan Suresh, Mike Lambeta, Yi Ma, Roberto Calandra, and Jitendra Malik. \"General in-hand object rotation with vision and touch.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2309.09979 (2023).\n\n[2] Yin, Zhao-Heng, Binghao Huang, Yuzhe Qin, Qifeng Chen, and Xiaolong Wang. \"Rotating without Seeing: Towards In-hand Dexterity through Touch.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2303.10880 (2023).\n\n[3] Bhirangi, Raunaq, Tess Hellebrekers, Carmel Majidi, and Abhinav Gupta. \"ReSkin: versatile, replaceable, lasting tactile skins.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.00071 (2021).\n\n[4] Nair, Suraj, Aravind Rajeswaran, Vikash Kumar, Chelsea Finn, and Abhinav Gupta. \"R3m: A universal visual representation for robot manipulation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2203.12601 (2022).\n\n[5] Radosavovic, Ilija, Tete Xiao, Stephen James, Pieter Abbeel, Jitendra Malik, and Trevor Darrell. \"Real-world robot learning with masked visual pre-training.\" In Conference on Robot Learning, pp. 416-426.

Real-World tactile data is usually very noisy, but simulation data is clean. Is there anything that will need to be changed in the approach for bridging this gap or making the representations more robust to noise, when real-world deployment is attempted? In general, the results in the paper are not convincing for justifying the last paragraph of page 9, because there is very little generalization demonstrated in simulation itself."
