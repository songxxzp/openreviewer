                "value": "This paper presents GLD (Generative Latent Dynamics), a novel self-supervised representation and generation method that captures spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. GLD improves motion learning by incorporating motion dynamics into a parameterized latent space. The method tracks a wide range of motions, including unseen targets, and adapts to potentially risky targets. Furthermore, the paper presents experimental evidence (on the MIT Humanoid robot) showcasing GLD's effectiveness and long-term learning capabilities in open-ended motion learning tasks.  Additionally, the supplementary experiments demonstrate that GLD possesses long-term learning capabilities, which allow learning agents to strategically progress novel target motions while avoiding unlearnable regions.\n\nThe main contributions of this paper are:\n1. GLD (Generative Latent Dynamics) is a new method that extracts spatial-temporal relationships in periodic or quasi-periodic motions. It uses a novel self-supervised, structured representation and generation approach.\n2. GLD has demonstrated its effectiveness in open-ended motion learning tasks. It has long-term learning capabilities that enable learning agents to strategically advance novel target motions while avoiding unlearnable regions.\n3. An online tracking framework powered by GLD has a fallback mechanism. This enables learning agents to dynamically adapt their tracking strategies and automatically identify and respond to potentially risky targets.\n4. Recognition of spatial-temporal structures creates new possibilities for future motion representation and learning algorithms.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAfter reviewed the author's rebuttal, I think the authors have addressed most of my concerns, therefore; I have increased my score."

Further study could help establish the controller's robustness and versatility.\n\n3. Limited Adaptability to Other Domains: The paper discusses motion representation and learning in robotics. However, it may not be easily transferable to other domains, such as human motion analysis, due to differences in motion characteristics.\n\n4.

Inspired by prior work that takes into account periodicity of motion, the proposed method extends the periodic autoencoder to add a generative capability. Based on the insight that some elements do not change during periodic motions, the paper propose GLD, where subsequent latent representation is trained to be predicted, assuming phase can be advanced incrementally. Using the trained network, the method proposes to train to learn policies that aligns the predicted state and the state of the observation. Then during inference, the authors propose to filter out potentially dangerous or difficult states using a fallback mechanism. They compare the difference between the designated state and the actual predicted states, and if the error is significant, they propose to reject the designated state and fall back to the predicted state. The authors conduct various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the actual latent space, as well as the proposed fallback mechanism."

The colored lines in Figures 5 and 6 is unclear.

The authors only discuss the results in Section 5.3, but there is no concrete evidence that the mechanism worked well.

The paper extends a PAE network (Starke 2022), which encodes a motion trajectory into a latent embedding used to generate a set of fourier coefficients. These coefficients are used to build a dynamics model assuming constant frequency, amplitude and offset, but time varying phase. The dynamics model predicts a future latent, which is decoded to produce a resultant motion. Control policies are also trained to generate frequency parameters that result in motion sequences that match some desired trajectory. A fallback mechanism compares the desired trajectory to the generated trajectory, and decides whether this is safe to follow (if both are similar), following a more conservative predicted motion if this is deemed unsafe."
