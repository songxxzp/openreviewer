                "value": "In this paper, authors have presented a hybrid approach for inferring an interpretable specification of a system showing piecewise dynamics. Authors used automata learning to infer an abstract model of a possibly black-box system\u2019s behavior and a neural network to learn its continuous dynamics. Automata learning is polynomial in the size of inputs and the number of congruency classes in the target language. Next, authors demonstrated a more effective training scheme for neural networks learning continuous dynamics in the presence of discontinuities. Through a step-by-step analysis using the bouncing ball, authors demonstrated that the proposed approach can efficiently learn interpretable models of piecewise dynamics with significantly fewer data points and computational resources compared to current state-of-the-art Methods."

To learn the piecewise Neural ODE, the paper uses the learned event specification to train a nonlinear transformation to map the last state in prefix to the initial state in the suffix at the discontiuity time."
