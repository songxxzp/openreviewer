The theoretical proofs show how the changes to the image being edited is bounded by a constant and converges. The approach is benchmarked on datasets involving lung x-rays, diabetic retinopathy, and skin lesions and shows promising performance against 2 other baselines, namely stable diffusion video and style based manifold extrapolation. The models are evaluated based on CLIP scores and classification confidence scores on the generated images. In addition to these experiments, a real-world edema progression and a user study is also shown to provide evidence that the disease progression makes sense."

Scarcity of such data is a genuine issue and to my knowledge, this work is among the few which attempts to do so without access to any temporal image data.\n2. The proposed approach performs well on confidence score metrics and shows gradual improvements with number increasing of steps. The use of the real-world dataset which sequential images and the user study provide good evidence of the efficacy of the approach. Similarly, showing performance on 3 datasets from different problem types is also a big plus.\n3. The availability of the code and the details in the supplementary are appreciated and a strong sign towards transparency and reproducibility. The experiments on ablations and sensitivity to hyperparamaters is also helpful for trying this approach and for future extensions of this work."

                "value": "1. Even though the paper shows the editing process to be bounded and converging, I find it hard to understand why generating disease progression in images without any intermediate temporal information will lead to the correct intermediate pathologies in the image. Neither the text, nor the image have any information about what temporally intermediate stages of the disease can look like. Lacking this info, it's not clear how the progression is constrained to be realistic or biologically plausible. The real-world experiments on the edema dataset as well as the user study are most certainly helpful, but not completely convincing.\n2. The paper proposes an interesting solution to a medical imaging problem, but is technically incremental in terms of the proposed method since it's a direct application of DDIM for conditional generation. \n3. The performance improvement with PIE is less significant on CLIP metrics. Additionally, all the similarity numbers on all datasets and baselines are usually high (>0.9 for a metric having a range of [-1,1]) which perhaps points to the fact that differences in this metric might not be hugely indicative of better fidelity, specially for medical images."

                "value": "1. Why are the confidence scores for other baselines so bad for the diabetic retinopathy dataset?\n2. The recall, and in turn F1 scores for the simulated images is higher than the real ones in the case study. If this is indeed due to the simulated images accentuating the disease features, does that pose as a risk to this technique, specially in situations where it hallucinates or exaggerates pathologies?\n3. Not a question, but the presence of RoI masks seems very important as without them, the model hallucinates significantly (as shown in the supplementary). It might be worth including this in the limitations sections or making this explicit for the readers if not already done so."

It is not entirely clear what the authors mean when they use these terms, and since this is a critical part of the work, this should really be defined.  Disease trajectory, I would understand to refer to the course of a disease over time. This could be in an individual or maybe as an average in a population. This would imply some predictive capability, and we are also told this in the abstract (see below). Yet there is as far as I can see no evidence that the proposed method can predict the future of individual patients or average patients. Instead it seems to me that what the approach is doing is instead to create images corresponding to different disease severities, which is certainly interesting, but a very different and generally easier problem. Loosely described, this could perhaps be called disease progression simulation, which is also a term used by the manuscript in places.\n\n- \"PIE can allow healthcare providers to model disease imaging trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses\" - where is the evidence for this?\n\n- \"Specifically, we leverage recent advancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression accurately and personalize it for each patient.\" - how is it personalized?\n\n\n- \"The learning rate in this iterative process is decaying exponentially with each iteration forward, which means that the algorithm is effectively exploring the solution space while maintaining a balance between convergence speed and stability.\", I don't think this is supported by evidence/references.\n\n- \"The physicians agree that simulated disease progressions generated by PIE closely matched physicians\u2019 expectations 76.2% of the time, indicating high accuracy and quality.\" - is this a relevant measure to compare to? Are physicians able to predict actual progression?\n\n- The question the physicians were asked appears to be \"Does the below disease progression fit your expectation?\" It is unclear if this is supposed to match a development in disease severity or what the specific development in this particular case would be expected to be.\n\n- \"However, all these methods have to use full sequential images and fail to address personalized healthcare in the imaging space. The lack of such time-series data, in reality, poses a significant challenge for disease progression simulation\". I am uncertain about what is meant by \"failing to address personalized healthcare in the imaging space\". Could more precise wording be used? Also I feel like the authors are overly focused on the requirement of sequential data as a limitation. Longitudinal data exists for a reason and it may be much more difficult if not impossible to derive individualized progression models from cross-sectional data alone. I would suggest the authors think about the wording here and present it not as a limitation of previous methods but rather as a situation where the proposed approach could be used where previous models may not.\n\n- Explain abbreviation DDIM\n\n- \"Due to the properties of DDIM, the step size would gradually decrease\nwith a constant factor.\", what step size? No mention of step size before this point.\n\n- Proposition 2 and 3, would benefit from some motivation, and explanation in text. There are variables and functions used without definition.\n\n- \"In addition, Proposition 2 and 3 show as n grows bigger, the changes between steps would grow smaller. Eventually, the difference between steps will get arbitrarily small. Hence, the convergence of P IE is guaranteed and modifications to any inputs are bounded by a constant.\" - I don't see how this follows. Could you help the reader a bit?\n\n- What are the numbers presented in Table 1?\n\n- \"To further assess the quality of our generated images, we surveyed 35 physicians and radiologists with 14.4 years of experience on average to answer a questionnaire on chest X-rays.\" - why are the questions asked not\n\n- \"Furthermore, a user study conducted with veteran physicians confirms that the simulated disease progressions generated by PIE meet real-world standards.\", what real world standards?"

A core in these generative models in medical imaging is to show that the model does not hallucinate; the generated subject-specific disease should reflect realistic progression. The paper lacks quantitative evaluation on this aspect. The only experiment (Fig. 7) shows that the simulated disease effect deviates largely from the real case.\n\n3. I'm having a hard time imagining what would be an ideal use scenario. The manuscript argues that the method can be used for \"model disease imaging trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, fill in missing imaging data in clinical records, and improve medical education\". I'm not convinced it can do all of those things except for the last goal of \"medical education\", where the method can generate synthetic disease effects without showing an actual patient's data (see my questions below)"

Why is this desired? How can such randomness contribute to \"model disease imaging trajectories over time, predict future treatment responses, fill in missing imaging data in clinical records\"?\n\n2. I'm not sure why the model should generate \"disease effects\" from a healthy image (e.g. Fig. 5 3rd row). Isn't this contradictory to \"predict future treatment responses\" or \"model disease imaging trajectories\"? Healthy subjects should simply have healthy trajectories."

Which ones?\n\n- You state: \u201cPIE also preserves unrelated visual features from the original medical imaging report\"\nQuestion 12: a- Care to clarify \"unrelated visual features\"\n                     b- \u201cunrelated\u201d to disease features? \n                     c- What about modifications to non-disease areas (unwanted behavior akin to false positive disease feature)?\n\n- You state: \u201cEach of these datasets presents unique challenges and differ in scale\u201d\nQuestion 13: By \u201cScale\u201d, do you mean size of the data sets?\"\n\n- You state: \u201c\u201crepresent whether the simulation results are aligned to target disease\u201d\nQuestion 14: Do you mean \u201cexpected disease progression\"?\n\n\nGeneral remarks:\n- Please always provide meaning of acronyms in-extenso when first used (HMM, DDIM, ROI, SD Video).\n- Figure 1:  You might just in one sentence introduce the reader to what \u201cCardiomegaly\u201d is supposed to manifest as in the X-ray.\n- Figure 2: Barely readable. Explaining the concentric circle representation might help.\n- Figure 3: Illustrations are barely readable. \u201cRed\u201d portions are hard to assess. May be differential images (disease progression from previous stage) might be more readable."
