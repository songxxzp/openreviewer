The Log-Choleski metric allows a closed-form expression of the Frechet mean, which is necessary for the aggregation step of the chosen GNN framework. Prior to this step, the feature transformation is performed by a double product with a learned parameter in the Stiefel manifold. Finally, the nonlinearity step is implemented as a rectification of the diagonal of the lower traingular part of a matrix, somehow modifying the eigenvalues of the matrix. The proposed SPDGNN architecture is compared with other geometric proposals for GNN, showing the performance of the model especially in the case of the airport database and disease."

                "value": "- Many of the contributions in this work are, in fact, already present in the literature, but the discussion regarding prior work is insufficient. The feature transformation with Stiefel matrices and the non-linear activation with the \"ReLU-like\" layer have already been proposed in [3]. However, at the point of defining these layers, the article does not clearly cite [3] as a reference but rather kind of presents them as original contributions. Additionally, the Riemannian/Cholesky approach is directly borrowed from [2], again without clear referencing when introduced. Moreover, there are significant interactions between the approach proposed here and that of [1], which is only discussed in the appendix. It is crucial to compare with [1] in the experiments and position this method in relation to it, as both seek GNNs where nodes are embedded in the space of SPD matrices. Consequently, it becomes challenging to precisely distinguish what constitutes contributions or ideas borrowed from other articles.\n\n- One crucial point that doesn't seem to be discussed is the algorithmic complexity compared to standard approaches. From a memory perspective, the approach seems already highly expensive since each node is represented as a matrix with roughly $n^2$ parameters. Furthermore, in terms of algorithmic complexity, just the aggregation layer requires performing approximately $m$ Cholesky decompositions and computing an outer product with each of the representations (equation 12). So I doubt that this architecture is really applicable. \n\n- I find that the article is generally quite confusing and not very clear. There are numerous and often ambiguous notations (for example, the notations for the Cholesky map and its inverse are almost identical), making it challenging to read. Additionally, the writing is quite heavy, with many vague and non-rigorous statements that don't convey a clear meaning. Here are a few examples:\n  - \"many complex graph data exhibit a profound non-Euclidean potential for analysis\" (what is a \"profound non-Euclidean potential\"?)\n  - \"the SDP manifold [...] captures the hierarchical structure of datasets in hyperbolic subspaces while retaining Euclidean characteristics.\"\n  - \"In typical GNNs, a fundamental assumption is implicitly linked to linear classifiers, as they heavily rely on the Euclidean geometry of $\\mathbb{R}^n$\" (this is not true; you can have Euclidean geometry but use non-linear classifiers).\n\n- The experimental setting in the article appears to lack clarity. The reported results include variances, but it's unclear on how many train/test splits these are based, neither if there is any cross-validation. Additionally, it's not specified whether the competing models were retrained for these experiments. If they were retrained, there is no information on how the retraining was conducted. Alternatively, it's unclear whether the performances were directly taken from the original articles. More transparency and details regarding the experimental setup and data handling would be beneficial for readers trying to understand and reproduce the results.\n\n- References:\n\n[1] Modeling Graphs Beyond Hyperbolic: Graph Neural Networks in Symmetric Positive Definite Matrices.
