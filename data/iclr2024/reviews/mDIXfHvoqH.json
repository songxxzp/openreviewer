                "value": "The authors identified an important limitation of the traditional trajectory prediction approaches that they require 2 seconds of observations to make accurate predictions. They took the HiVT model as an example, and its prediction performance drops significantly when only two observations are available. However, for an autonomous driving vehicle to safely operate, a trajectory prediction model needs to be able to make accurate predictions for an agent before it has been observed for 2 seconds.\n\nTo tackle this limitation, the authors proposed an instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. ITPNet is able to make predictions with only two observations.\n\nThe key idea of ITPNet is to use a backward forecasting module to reconstruct the unobserved latent feature representations of the agent using the two observed ones.\n\nThe authors also proposed a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former (NRRFormer) module to filter the reconstructed unobserved features.\n\nITPNet is a generic plug-and-play approach that can be used in combination with any trajectory prediction backbones. In this paper, the authors applied ITPNet on HiVT and LaneGCN backbones. They evaluated the resulting ITPNet+HiVT and ITPNet+LaneGCN models on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets. The evaluation results show that, when using two observations, ITPNet significantly improves the prediction performance over the HiVT and LaneGCN baselines.\n\nThe authors also performed ablation studies to evaluate the contributions from the reconstruction loss and NRRFormer."

The authors show that this trend persists when the model is trained with few or many prior observation timesteps.\n\nTo ameliorate performance, they propose two adjustments (summarized in Figure 2) when forming the latent state to be used for downstream trajectory prediction: \n\n1) They reconstruct previous timestep latent states corresponding to unobserved poses through a backward forecasting loss (section 3.3, equation 2). An additional loss term is also introduced encourage variability between latent states of different timesteps (equation 7). \n\n2) They propose a self-attention module to limit redundancy and noise in the latent state representation dubbed NRRFormer (section 3.4)\n\nThe final latent state representation from their network is then input into a downstream trajectory prediction module (HiVT or LaneGCN).\n\nTheir approach is validated in trajectory prediction using the Argoverse and NuScene datasets using only 2 prior observations (section 4). They find improved ADE performance compared to baselines (section 4.4, Table 1). An ablation study is included in Table 2 assessing the effects of the proposed adjustments. \n\nThey further assess the effect of changing the number (N) of predicted unobserved prior poses (Table 3) where they find that performance gradually increases with N before dropping which they assert is caused by the introduction of noise and redundancy. Although they find that their NRRFormer potentially eliminates this issue.\n\nFinally, they visually inspect the predicted trajectories (Figure 4) and find their approach to yield more diverse and accurate trajectories compared to baselines."

I would have found it useful to report a confidence interval or variance over the results although perhaps it is not conventional in this area. \n\n- It would have insightful to report how the NRRFormer affects performance for smaller values of N in Table 3. As it currently is, section 4.4 \u201cAnalysis of Different Lengths $N$\u201d seems somewhat rushed with mentions of how the usage of the NRRFormer was done \u201cwithout tuning it carefully\u201d.\n\n-\tIt would be useful to show how the method\u2019s performance changes for different number of prior observed locations (T) since only 2 prior observations are considered in this work (Table 4). During practical usage, I would assume that we would want to use all available prior observed locations for future trajectory prediction and so the T value will change. The authors have shown that their method outperforms baselines at T=2 prior observations, but does this trend continue for higher values of T? Does the method improve performance at all values of T versus baselines or is there a point where it is a detriment. For example, given a test trajectory with T=10 prior observations, do we trust the author\u2019s method over baselines? \n\n- Although not needed at test time, the method requires ground-truth positions of unobserved states for the backward forecasting reconstruction loss during training. Depending on the dataset collection procedure, these may be hard to obtain. Furthermore \u2013 from what I understand \u2013 the HiVT and LaneGCN baselines in Table 1 are only trained with 2 observed prior locations and so it could be argued that the proposed approach requires more labeled data (predicts additional timesteps of prior locations which requires ground-truth labels). Although, at least for the HiVT method, the authors assert that training on all historic prior locations actually decreases performance (Figure 1) and so the second part of this criticism may be a moot. Nonetheless, I wonder if the additional labeled data could be used by the baselines in some other way (for example, training with variable length sequences).\n\n- The approach assumes given 2d locations as prior observations instead of raw sensory input. For the problem cases that this work attempts to address (example: vehicle suddenly emerging behind obstruction), I would wonder how accurate these 2d locations may be given limited tracking timesteps. Noisy or inaccurate initial 2d poses may have negative downstream consequences when input into the authors\u2019 method and thus reduce the reported performance gains that they assert in their results. From what I understand, the authors simply truncated longer fully observed trajectories to 2 observations and so the unique circumstances of the previous problem case may be ignored.\n\n__Minor wording corrections to improve the final version (no effect on score):__\n\n- On page 2, the usage of \u201cstraightly\u201d in \u201cLet\u2019s consider a scenario where a vehicle travels straightly \u2026\u201d is awkward. Perhaps simply replace with the word \u201cstraight\u201d."

                "value": "1. The baselines is too old. Though LaneGCN and HiVT are both classic works, they are far from state-of-art-performace. Open sourced works like QCNet, MTR might worth trying.\n\n2. Limited usage. The instantaneous trajectory prediction is interesting. However, the proposed method brings lots of extra parameters and computations.  Let's discuss an actual deployment problem: I observe that even ITPNet+HiVT < HiVT with 2s inputs and during your training, all parameters of HiVT are tuned without freezing. Thus, during actual deployment , the system should run an extra inference of the ITPNet+HiVT for those instantaneous objects while running the original HiVT for all the other fully observed agents. I am not sure whether worth it to double the inference for those instantaneous objects.\n\n3. Some experiments and ablations are unclear, which seems that the work is incomplete and the working part is unclear. See question section."

                "value": "1. **One interesting perspective is that: the proposed method might benefit from the extra training signals of the task of predicting history instead of only future,  which could better utilize data like in Forcase-MAE [1].**  How would the authors think about it?\n\n2. Why only single-mode forcasting for history instead of multi-mode like for future prediction?\n\n3. Did you compare the results of predicting waypoints and predicting features?\n\n4. The NRRFormer and backward forecasting  steps N=10 seems harmful for the best mode (K=1).\n\n5. The contrastive loss seems have little influence. The authors might consider multiple tries.\n\n[1] Forecast-MAE: Self-supervised Pre-training for Motion Forecasting with Masked Autoencoders. ICCV 23."
