These features are then upsampled to higher resolution and aligned using the inverse of the applied perturbations. Statistical aggregation, including mean and median, along the perturbation dimension, produces fine-grained feature representations. This method is evaluated on multiple CV tasks like object segmentation, depth estimation and unsupervised saliency segmentation."

As a remedy, the authors propose resolving patch contributions by perturbing the input by stochastic translation of the input image and subsequent aggregation in the embedding space to extract sub-token resolution features. \n\nThe authors directly refer to their method as a form of stochastic resonance. In classical stochastic resonance, thresholded boundaries are softened through the addition of stochastic noise, and the idea the paper seems to propose is that discrete boundaries of the partitioning can be super-resolved via stochastic perturbation with translations to allow neighbouring tokens to share information when aggregated. The goal seems to be to preserve finer grained spatial details and hence reduce the impact of the general partitioning in classical ViT tokenisation. The approach is reminiscent of classical dithering. The paper also mentions that the approach could easily be extended to other perturbations or augmentations, and is not necessarily \n\nApplications of the method is demonstrated, but largely limited to post-hoc or few-shot modelling approaches where features are further processed for dense prediction tasks; including upscaled feature visualisations using PCA, experiments on video object segmentation, and monocular depth prediction. Two non-dense downstream tasks are also demonstrated. \n\nIn summary, this reviewer find certain parts of the paper interesting and novel, particularly as a ensembling distillation method. However the methodology is murky at points, and the presented problem statement and applications somewhat undersells what this reviewer consider to be the strong points of the method."

This further makes the method potentially interesting for self-supervision and fine tuning.\n- The authors outline a distillation scheme that improves performance in certain downstream tasks. This posits the method as similar to augmentation for an ensemble based fine tuning tasks, which seems apt for further investigation. This distillation process could potentially be used in improved fine tuning for general ViT modelling approaches.\n- The paper seems to want to discuss what this reviewer considers an important and often overlooked limitation inherent in the canonical ViT architecture, where uniform partitioning might not align well with the spatial semantic content in the image."

The quantisation artefacts are presented as a result of discrete partitioning into uniform square patches, but the exact nature of these artefacts as well as their effect on predictions are hardly discussed or touched upon. This makes the problem statement more ambiguous than necessary.~~ **Edit:** *The last revision addresses this with a formalisation of the context of SRT.*\n- While the upscaled feature visualisations show improvement on the low resolution visualisations of the base model, ~~simpler interpolation methods exist for this express purpose. It is also not clear if these new feature maps can be said to be faithful as interpretations of the importance of the features with regard to the predictions.~~ **Edit**: *The authors expand their experiments with alternative interpolation methods, however the main concern on how useful the visualisations are as attributions for model predictions is not clear. The authors revise the manuscript and does no longer claim this as one of the main contributions of the work.*\n- ~~While the authors mention the conceptual overlap with Amir et al. (2021), this connection is not touched on to any further extent in the paper, except for a discussion on computational complexity. It seems natural to contrast against the results in this work since, by the authors own admission, there is an inherent similarity between approaches.~~ *The authors expands the link in their revised work with additional results.*\n- Methodology for non-dense downstream tasks (particularly image retrieval) seems unclear, and hardly reproducible. Several questions remain unanswered for practitioners wanting to reproduce the results in the paper. ~~Additionally, there seems to be little to no mention of input resolutions used for the modelling.~~ **Edit:** *Note on resolution was addressed. While the authors seek to address gaps in methodology by releasing their code, more exposition in the manuscript would be ideal, but is further addressed in the last revision*.\n\nWe also detail some minor weaknesses:\n- ~~The link to stochastic resonance, while somewhat clear to this reviewer, is a little opaque. While this analogy could provide an intuitive understanding of the method, it is imperative to clarify the link and show the extent to which quantisation artefacts inhibit ViTs. Stochastic resonance typically involves the enhancement of weak signals in the presence of noise. In this context, techniques are applied for extracting super-resolved features by treating the discrete boundaries imposed by the partitioning in the tokeniser as the thresholds. In this reviewers opinion, the link should be emphasised and clarified to improve the overall contribution of the paper.~~ *The authors agree that this is an issue, and have substantially revised their manuscript.* \n- While the authors highlight the computational limitations of ensembling, at times the wording in the article seems to point to computational benefits, e.g. \"Practical implementations demonstrate efficient execution on even laptop GPUs\". ~~At the same time, the study is limited to ViT-S16 capacities due to computational considerations. While we wholeheartedly agree that not all studies need to be extrapolated to models with huge memory footprints, the limitation to small architectures strikes the author as a little too restrictive, and using a base model (ViT-B16) would have been more convincing.~~ *The authors included larger models in subtasks and expand their results for segmentation in the revised paper.*\n- While the method is novel, the current applications seem moderately niched.\n\n**Summary from rebuttal:** *Several of the concerns were addressed in the last revision, and while certain doubts still linger on the potential impact of the method given the role of new tokenisation methods to alleviate quantisation artefacts, the method is novel with promising initial results.*"
