The mechanisms for generating unlearnable examples work similarly to availability attacks. Observing that unlearnable examples generated for supervised learners do not achieve contrastive unlearnability, the paper aims to achieve unlearnability for both supervised and contrastive learning algorithms. Built upon unlearnable example attacks (Huang et al., 2020) and adversarial poisoning attacks (Fowl et al., 2021), the paper proposed to use enhanced data augmentations to create shortcuts for contrastive learning, thus improving the worst-case unlearnability across different supervised and contrastive learning methods."

                "value": "As shown in the pseudo-code in Section 4.1, the proposed method employs a tuning hyperparameter to control the strength of the data augmentation. While the considered threat model is of practical importance, the technical contributions of the paper are not strong enough. \n\nAnother concern is the presented empirical and theoretical results are not structured clearly and coherently, which hinders my understanding of the paper\u2019s overall contributions. For Section 3, the definitions of alignment loss and uniformity loss are introduced in existing work (Wang & Isola, 2020), so they should be moved to the previous background section. The remaining part of Section 3 seems new but is not well-explained. The main empirical finding of Section 3 is that contrastive unlearnability seems correlated with alignment and uniformity gaps. However, there is no clear explanation of how these poisoning methods are grouped in Table 1. It would also be useful to conduct a correlation analysis to demonstrate how strong the correlation is, such as providing the Pearson correlation coefficients. In addition, I do not understand why clean/poisoned alignment & uniformity scores and SL accuracy are also demonstrated in Table 3, which are redundant from my perspective. Moreover, it is hard for me to understand why the results of Table 1 imply the need for enhanced data augmentation. The explanations provided at the end of Section 3 are difficult to parse, and I found the transition between Sections 3 and 4 abrupt. For Section 4, I do not understand the role of Theorem 4.1, where I found the presented theoretical results particularly hard to parse. For example, why do you assume the supervised loss is the mean squared error, and the contrastive loss contains only one negative example? What does the upper bound proven in Theorem 4.1 imply? I would expect a detailed discussion of how Theorem 4.1 connects to the main messages you are trying to convey.\n\nFinally, a minor concern is that the empirical improvements on worst-case unlearnability are not strong. For example, CP-BYOL achieves 41.8% performance on CIFAR-10, which is relatively competitive compared with your methods, while TUE-MoCo achieves relatively similar worst-case unlearnability on CIFAR-100. It would be useful to study why these existing methods can attain good performance and explain how your method improves over them."

            "questions": {
                "value": "In addition to the questions above, I have the following comments and suggestions for the paper:\n\n1. It would be useful to explain the existing poisoning attacks and their abbreviations in Section 3 before the introduction of Table 1 (instead of Section 5.1). In particular, how these methods are selected and grouped in the table should be explained clearly. Two considered methods, _EntF_ and _HYPO_, are neither effective against _SimCLR_ nor _SL_, so I wonder why they are tested.\n\n2. In the pseudo-code provided in Section 4.1, it is clear that you employ a single parameter _s_ to control the augmentation strength. The parameter applies to three augmentation functions: _RandomsizedCrop()_, _RandomApply()_, and _RandomGrayscale()_. I would like to know whether the worst-case unlearnability can be improved if different hyperparameters are applied to different augmentation functions for your method. A general question is: How does the defender choose the right augmentation functions and their corresponding hyperparameters to achieve the best protection performance?\n\n3. Have you tried to apply your augmentation method to other alternative poisoning attacks, such as TUE and CP? Can you further improve the worst-case learnability based on their method?\n\n4. Section 5.3 presents early stopping as a potential mitigation approach for unlearnable examples. Claiming this as a mitigation method is a bit confusing since unlearnable examples are designed to protect the data from the defender's perspective. It would be helpful to explain in more detail how the attacker can employ early stopping to enhance their attack effectiveness.\n\n5. Tables 3-6 are difficult to read. Please replace them with larger ones in the next version of your paper."

The goal is to make it extremely challenging for algorithms to train effective models using this data. In cases where supervised learning algorithms fail to achieve this unlearnability, malicious data collectors might turn to contrastive learning algorithms to bypass the protection. Successful attacks must target both supervised and contrastive unlearnability. However, the evaluation shows that most existing availability attacks struggle to achieve contrastive unlearnability, which poses a significant risk to data protection.\n\nThis paper reveals that utilizing more robust data augmentations during supervised poisoning generation can lead to the creation of contrastive shortcuts, potentially undermining the protection measures. Leveraging this insight, we introduce AUE and AAP attacks, which significantly enhance worst-case unlearnability across various supervised and contrastive algorithms."

It appears that the novelty is diminished slightly by the earlier discoveries regarding stronger augmentations, although they focused on defenses.\n2. It remains to be seen whether stronger defense-phase augmentations beats stronger attack-phase augmentations. The few results on this is in Table 3, and the answer remains inconclusive. The reviewer suspects that \u201cshortcuts\u201d are difficult to form with such stronger defenses with a tight perturbation budget. \n3. In Figure 1, UT-AAP is not strictly better than UT-AP.\n4.

The rationale behind Theorem 4.1 could benefit from additional clarification, as its purpose remains somewhat ambiguous. In Section 4.1, the primary takeaway appears to be the notion that to effectively generate poisons, it is imperative to employ stronger augmentations in line with those utilized by contrastive learning algorithms.\n3.

                "value": "*  An existing method SEP seems to demonstrate a Pareto improvement over every attack this work proposes, except for UT-AAP. \n* I do appreciate the authors principled approach, and intuition, and analysis. Although I think the finding that strong augmentations during poison crafting improves unlearnable examples was also found in [1]. But this work does include very thorough analysis of this, as well as introducing more augmentations during training of the generating model.\n* This isn't a weakness of the core work, but tables 3-6 are way too small and it can be aggravating to have to zoom in significantly while reading the work. I would suggest moving to the appendix. Also legends/labels on several of the figures had this same problem.\n\n\n[1] Fowl, Liam, et al. \"Adversarial examples make strong poisons.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 30339-30351."
