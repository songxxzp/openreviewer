The paper provides two variants, Swin4TS/CD and Swin4TS/CI, which can adapt to channel-dependent and channel-independent strategies, respectively. The experiments show that the model outperforms existing baselines on eight benchmark datasets."

The tables (2, 3, and 4) for many experiments are incomplete on the dataset. Some notations can be not so rigorous (\\hat_x may be better to denote the model predictions). Thus, this paper essentially needs further polishing. \n2. The contributions of the paper can be not enough, which is the most fatal point. Swin-transformer modules are adapted for the time series. It's like lowering the dimension of attention directly on 1D time series representations. Is this more motivating than design models considering time series properties? How does inductive bias like shift invariance help time series forecasting? Without considering the gap between the two modalities, I think it has not contributed much to the research field.\n3. The performance incremental is marginal. The forecasting result of Swin4TS over PatchTST can be small. And I think the ablations should be conducted on more extensive datasets. Also, I suggest that experiments such as hyperparameter effects are more suitable to be placed in the appendix, and more experiments exploring the helpful inductive bias should be considered.\n4. Unsolved contribution: \"We successfully apply techniques from ViT to LTSF\", which does not \"indicate the potential of connecting time series with other domains within the Transformer architecture\". What does the 'connection' mean? The author provides no experiments to validate the results of cross-domain/modality transfer."

The time series forecasting task, on the contrary, belongs to a typical generative task and needs to learn low-level feature representation for time point reconstruction. How does the proposed model cope with the gap between tasks and representation granularity? \n2. Is it an advantage that being able to combine CI/CD mechanisms? Previous forecasting models are commonly implemented by CD, but they can also be easily incorporated with CI, no matter Transformers or non-Transformers."

The model performance is not monotonically increasing with size of context in some corner cases which is not the case with other SOTA models.\n\n5. Is the ablation of varying hierarchical design done in the correct manner? As I understand more hierarchies also mean more layers? Is it not better to keep the number of layers the same and just have hierarchy in one model while the scales are fixed in all layers in the ablation one?\n\n6. What would be the strategy to handle static and dynamic covariates ?\n\nOverall I believe the paper is well written and the use SWin is logical at least in the CI case. The architecture is not novel but nevertheless has not been used for time-series before. I would like to see the answers of my questions before deciding on the final score. It would also be good if the authors can think of some way to show whether the different scales in the hierarchy extract different types of information like long term trends vs local seasonality."

Can the authors elaborate what the last layer looks like for the CD model? is it just mapping the flattened version of all output tokens to the future of all M time-series. In this case is this layer not too big? There might be better designs that map only specific patches to specific output predictions.\n\n2. For vision models contiguous patches in the window are visually close in the image. This is not the case for the channel dimension in the CD time-series case. In other words does the order of the time-series matter? It should not matter in the ideal case. Can the authors show this experimentally?\n\n3. Since the paper has a section on time-complexity it would be wise to compare with non transformer methods like TiDE (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08424.pdf) and N-HiTS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12886.pdf). These methods are much faster and have comparable or better performance. For instance the numbers reported in the traffic dataset for the TiDE model are better than the ones reported in the paper. It would be good to cite and compare to these MLP based works.\n\n4. It seems that for some horizon lengths in Figure 6 the performance decreases a little bit with increasing context. This does not seem to be the case for PatchTST and TiDE. Any intuition on why this might be happening?"

Attention layers are applied to the patches within a single window known as window attention. Shifted window attention is window attention on the time series shifted by half a window. The final architecture is a sequence of window and shifted window attentions for processing a particular scale. The model processes at multiple scales by feeding the downsampled output from the output of scale K as the input for scale K+1.
