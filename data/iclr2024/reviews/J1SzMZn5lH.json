In particular, the extension assumes that the objective $f$ is given by $f(x) = \\sum_{I=1}^N f_i(x_i)$ where $x=(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)^\\top$ and the constraint function $g$ is given by $g(x) = \\sum_{I=1}^N g_i(x_i)$ where $x=(x_1,\\ldots, x_N)^\\top$. The setting here is referred to as *multi-agent* in the paper in that individual agent $i\\in [N]$ makes its decision $x_i$. Moreover, there exists an affine constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^N A_i x_i = b$ that couples the individual decisions $x_1,\\ldots, x_N$. Here, the basic idea is to dualize the affine constraint to decouple the decisions $x_1,\\ldots, x_N$. Then one may apply the drift-based primal-dual method of [Zhou and Ji (NeurIPS 2022)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/00295cede6e1600d344b5cd6d9fd4640-Abstract-Conference.html) developed for the single-agent setting to optimize the individual decisions."

In fact, the problem setting of multi-agent BO shares many similarities with federated BO/kernelized bandits, including both the first point (the agents do not share the local observations) and second point (the function evaluations are done locally) discussed in the bottom paragraph of page 1. These previous works may not diminish the novelty of the current paper though, because as far as I know, no prior federated BO/kernelized bandit papers have considered constraints.       \n[1] Federated Bayesian Optimization via Thompson Sampling, 2020,      \n[2] Differentially Private Federated Bayesian Optimization with Distributed Exploration, 2021,      \n[3] Communication Efficient Distributed Learning for Kernelized Contextual Bandits, 2022,      \n[4] Kernel-Based Federated Learning with Personalization, 2022.\n\n- The paper did give some real-world scenarios with black-box constraints and know affine constraints, however, are there use cases with both types of constraints? The experiments section also only has one experiment with only known affine constraints, so I think it will be helpful to apply the method to an experiment with both types of constraints.\n- I think the example given at the top of page 5 can be further clarified.\n- Theorem 1: I think some discussions regarding the differences between the two cases would be helpful. Regarding the dependency on $\\sum^N_{i=1}\\sum^m_{j=1}\\gamma^T_{i,j}$, if we substitute in the rate of $\\gamma$ for either the SE kernel and Matern kernel, I guess this term would depend linearly on $N$ and $m$? If this is the case, then for case 1 of Theorem 1, the first term in the regret bound would have a dependency of $N^2$ and $m$. Also, it is mentioned in the paragraph below Theorem 1 that \"we can trade violation for smaller regret\", I think some elaborations would be helpful.\n- Remark 4: if I understand correctly, the assumption $\\lim_{T\\rightarrow \\infty}\\sum^N_{i=1}\\sum^m_{j=1}\\gamma^T_{i,j} / \\sqrt{T} = 0$ holds for the Matern kernel only when the function is smooth?\n- Figure 1: I agree that the strong violation of the proposed DMABO grows slower and slower yet the baseline of DCEI suffers from linear growth, but in this figure, the strong violations of DMABO is always larger than DCEI. It seems the relative magnitude is only reversed when the number of steps is large enough."
