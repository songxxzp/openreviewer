So the claim of \"approximately 1.5 times faster than the most efficient existing algorithm\" is misleading.\n3. The proposed method is neither scalable (with time complexity $O(N^3)$) nor theoretically guaranteed (from the perspective of approximation ratio).\n4. From the perspective of performance, I do not see BOIM outperforms SIM-DD much.\n5.

                "value": "1. There is key issue in the assumption of the algorithm design. In most real-world applications, the important nodes are in most cases O(N) or at least O(poly(N)) like sqrt(N) etc. And the number of seeds to be selected in real marketing applications are usually at least few hundreds for like graph with 10k nodes and much more in real-world networks with millions or billions of nodes. The O(a^k) algorithm is not a reasonable algorithm to solve the problem at all.\n2. The proposed algorithm is highly inefficient and there are issues in the time complexity analysis of the proposed method and competing methods. For simulation based method, though the exact evaluation is #P-hard, sampling based method with a few thousand samples can converge to a very high accuracy as shown in previous work. In an efficient implementation, T = O(M) instead of O(2^k). And the dominant term of the proposed algorithm is O(N^3). The issue exists in the analysis of methods from the literature.\n3. The authors fail to include comparison in both time complexity analysis and empirical evaluation to the state-of-art near-linear time algorithm with approximation guarantee like Influence Maximization in Near-Linear Time: A Martingale Approach and many more recent algorithms. The propose method also relies on slow simulation to sample value of influence function and assumes either IC and LT model which can both be solved much more efficient with existing methods.\n4. The proposed graph kernel is not well justified as why the proposed kernel is a better choice. Either theoretical or empirical analysis will help. Also the authors should at least properly define the variance in Theorem 4.2. Moreover, it is not clear how it helps the algorithms overall.\n5. The empirical evaluation is not convincing. First, the authors should clearly present the experiment setting like graph statistics, number of seed nodes. Second, the number of seed selected is too small (3 is used in experiment), which is not reasonable in any real-world applications. Third, the greedy method takes 10678s to select only three seeds on a 2k nodes graph.  Even the most naive implementation with optimization like CELF should not take this long. Since it only requires 3 seeds * 100 rounds *2000^2 (N^2 assume dense graph which is far higher than in real case) computation only. Forth, as mentioned above, the authors should include comparison to the near-linear time algorithms in comparison. the IMM algorithm uses ~100 seconds to find 50 seeds in a network of 40M nodes (Influence Maximization in Near-Linear Time: A Martingale Approach and many more recent algorithms)."
