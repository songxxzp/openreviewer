These shifts stem from corrupted test images, which may include issues such as noise and blur.\n\nTo tackle this problem, the authors propose a method that penalizes abrupt changes in class prototypes by employing exponential moving average (EMA). By leveraging this technique, the authors aim to enhance the adaptability of the model in the face of distribution shifts caused by various forms of image corruption.\n\nThe authors conduct thorough evaluations of their approach on widely-acknowledged continual test time adaptation benchmarks, specifically Imagenet-C and CIFAR-100. Their results demonstrate that their method occasionally outperforms existing state-of-the-art test time adapters, namely EATA, CoTTA, and RMT.\n\nOverall, the paper assembles a simple technique for addressing the challenges posed by distribution shifts, offering some insights into improving the adaptability of pre-trained CNNs under diverse test conditions."

Despite being an application paper, the method merely applies EMA for continual test time adaptation, employing standard techniques for selecting reliable test exemplars, computing class prototypes, and calculating EMA penalties. These methodologies are well-established within the existing literature.\n\nW2:\nThe empirical evidence presented in the paper lacks persuasiveness. A substantial performance boost could have justified the paper's simplicity and application-oriented nature. However, the minor improvement over EATA and RMT, as indicated primarily in Table 1-2 (i.e., less than +0.5% accuracy), does not substantiate the approach's effectiveness convincingly.\n\nW3:\nOne notable omission in the paper is the absence of a comparison or reference against a significant baseline, namely NOTE [1], which is a robust continual test-time adaptation method designed to handle temporal correlations. This baseline is highly relevant to the authors' objectives and should have been included for a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, the paper missed an opportunity for greater depth by limiting its evaluation to simple, artificial distribution shifts induced by corruptions. It could have been more compelling if the authors had explored and evaluated the method against natural shifts or temporal correlations, thus enhancing the paper's overall impact and relevance."

The second component is to align the features of the target domain with a precomputed set of prototypical features from the source domain.

While the proposed method is simple to both understand and implement, there are several caveats that need to be discussed:\n\n(1a) How are the hyper parameters tuned? Is the source data used to initialize $P^s$ employing training data or validation data? \n\n(1b) This paper needs to properly state its contributions over TTAC (the other clustering approach in the literature).\n\n(1c) It is unclear whether the predictions in Algorithm 1 line 5 are adjusted before the output phase (line Ensure) as the predictions $z$ are returned as $\\hat y$. Further, the algorithm returns the set of predictions for all data-points and all domains rather than conducting the evaluation in an online manner (return the predictions batch by batch). \n\n2- Experiments. The experimental analysis in the work show marginal performance gains of the proposed approach. Further, there are missing key experimental details and comparisons:\n\n(2a) How is the hyperparemeter search done for the proposed approach? Is a similar effort put into other baselines (e.g. EATA + TTAC)?\n\n(2b) It is unclear why the proposed components degrade the performance of EATA under small batch-sizes?\n\n(2c) While EATA does not regularize for its features to be clustered (unlike the proposed approach), they are still very competitive (better in discriminating different clusters) when the proposed components are absent.\n\n(2d) Generally, I think the analysis and comparison of the proposed method should be against EATA+TTAC rather than EATA (e.g. in Figure s 4 and 5).\n\n(2e) Experiments with different and more powerful architectures that do not use batch normalization (e.g. ViT) layers are missing.\n\n3- Writing. The writing of this work should be vastly improved to enhance its readability. Here are a list of suggestion to be considered in the final version:\n\n(3a) The problem definition is not clear. Both $k$ and $t$ are used to refer to time.\n\n(3b) The introduction should state clearly the contributions this work provides.\n\n(3c) Algorithm 1 is unclear how the prediction is conducted and what predictions are returned (line 5 computes z while last line returns $\n\\hat y$.\n\n(3d) Captions of Tables 3 and 4 should be improved to elaborate what metric is reported and what to pay attention to.\n\n(3e) The related work section is missing from the main paper and put in the appendix. It is essential to have this section to clearly position this work in the literature.\n\nOverall, while I like the simplicity of the proposed approach, the performance gains are generally very marginal (with best choice of hyper parameters) questioning the usefulness of the proposed method."

            "summary": {
                "value": "This paper studies the problem of continual test-time model adaptation, where training data is not accessible and only continually changing target domains are available. To keep adapting the model to the continually changing target domains in an online manner, they propose to maintain an exponential moving average target prototype for each class with reliable target samples. In addition, semantic alignment is achieved by matching the target feature to its corresponding pre-computed source prototype. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach."

                "value": "- The problem of addressing continuously shifted target domains is a significant yet under-explored topic, especially in the context of test-time adaptation.\n\n- The proposed prototype alignment with EMA target prototypes is simple and easy to implement.\n\n- The experiments conducted in the manuscript provide a comprehensive comparison with the most closely related works, spanning across a broad array of Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) benchmarks and baseline methods."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- My major concern is about the novelty. Prototypical alignment has been extensively explored in previous domain adaptation methods. The major difference between the proposed approach and those prior efforts seems marginal. I suggest that the authors provide detailed comparisons and showcase why their proposed approach is preferable when applied to test-time adaptation scenarios.\n\n- The writing quality of the article is average, with unclear logical progression and lack of fluency in some parts. There are also numerous instances of imprecise word usage. I recommend that the authors have a native English speaker conduct a thorough proofreading to enhance the clarity, coherence, and overall readability of the manuscript. This will ensure that the paper meets the high standards expected of publications in this field and effectively communicates its contributions to the intended audience."
