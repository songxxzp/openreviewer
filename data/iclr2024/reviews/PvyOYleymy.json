                "value": "This paper introduces CRATE-MAE, a novel white-box deep network architecture designed for large-scale unsupervised representation learning. Unlike traditional networks, CRATE-MAE is rooted in the mathematical connection between diffusion, compression, and masked completion. Each layer of this architecture has a clear, interpretable role, transforming data into structured representations and vice versa. The study's key contribution is adapting the white-box design for unsupervised learning, a notable departure from its typical supervised applications. Empirically, CRATE-MAE outperforms traditional models on large imagery datasets with 30% fewer parameters, while offering structured and semantically meaningful representations."

The results presented in Table 2 seem somewhat restrictive, making it challenging for readers to gauge the model's efficacy in relation to others.\n\n2. **Local Self-Supervised Learning Comparison**: From a broader perspective on self-supervised learning (SSL), this paper could be classified under local SSL, emphasizing layer-specific objectives and training. Although this area might be less traversed, incorporating findings from related works, such as [A], would enhance the paper's credibility.\n[A] Siddiqui, Shoaib Ahmed, et al. \"Blockwise self-supervised learning at scale.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.01647 (2023).\n\n3. **Absence of Linear Probing Results**: Omitting linear probing results restricts the paper from showcasing the practicality and caliber of the representations derived using CRATE-MAE.\n\n4. **Dataset Limitations**: The study's dependence on a confined dataset for classification raises concerns about the breadth of its applicability and potential generalization to diverse scenarios."

Are they with fully-visible inputs?\n* Table 4 again lacks a comparison of a similarly-sized MAE (how it performs on the same dataset as the mask ratio changes). It is not clear a conclusion from ImageNet classification can be transferred to CIFAR.\n* Figure 4: how does it compare with a supervised encoder/decoder trained on ImageNet?
