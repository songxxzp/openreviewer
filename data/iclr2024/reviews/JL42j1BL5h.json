As a result result they can be used in these languages, and people do use them. However, if the safety alignment only targets English, this can result in a significant disparity in the outcomes, beyond simple performance differences. That is why multilingual safety evaluation of LLMs is very important.\n2. The paper demonstrates that significant safety disparities do exist between languages.\n3. The paper shows that simple prompting strategies can reduce these disparities.\n4. The paper offers a new dataset, which while being machine-translated, has been checked by professional translators.\n5. The authors also validate that their automated evaluation using Google Translator is good enough by again using professional translators."

Especially considering that different languages have different grammar and large part of the tokens is not topic-specific. You say \u201cBoth quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the XSAFETY benchmark shares similar data distributions across languages, indicating the possibly consistent translation as expected.\u201d but where is this analysis? Furthermore, the \u201ctranslation\u201d of \u307e\u305b and \u3059\u308c is not a translation but rather transliteration. They are both parts of grammatical constructs and hence not translatable. Overall, this paragraph seems unmotivated and poorly defended. Won\u2019t the issue be resolved by simply having multiple translations and variations per sample? And similarly augment the original corpus? This would also make the results more robust to the choice of words and phrasing. \n2. The \u201cModels\u201d paragraph seems to be mostly pure guessing of the language distribution in the pretraining data. It is not clear that the GPT-3 distribution is representative for ChatGPT, and furthermore, depending on whether one uses the 3.5 or 4 version of ChatGPT the number could be even more different. The values for PaLM 2 seem to be not \u201cestimated\u201d but \u201cguessed\u201d. The issue is further complicated because of language similarity: German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, etc. can result in cross-language learning while others, e.g. Korean cannot. Overall, this analysis does not seem to be necessary for the conclusions of the paper, so I am not sure what purpose it serves.\n3. I am missing a discussion on the limitations of the work.\n4. Neither the dataset nor the results (actual model responses) have been provided.\n5. The dataset offered consists of translated samples of two prior works.

It\u2019s also worth to mention that I read (Sun et al., 2023) but the examples are provided in Chinese without gloss so I can\u2019t access the quality of the dataset in (Sun et al., 2023)\n\n- While the work focuses on evaluating English-centric LLMs, the benchmark is mainly derived from the Chinese dataset in (Sun et al., 2023). This could potentially be biased toward safety assessment in Chinese rather than English. While the authors attempted to remove culture specific (Chinese) aspects from the dataset. It\u2019s unclear to me why this dataset is a good starting point for building the multilingual benchmark As benchmarking is a very important step toward making LLMs more safe, I would expect much of the text dedicated to describe and convince the reader that the benchmark is adequate and well constructed. \n\n- Using chatGPT as an evaluator for safety doesn\u2019t seem like a good idea to me. The authors have stated that safety is a very important issue, to which I agree. As such an important issue, human evaluation should be done rather than using another LLM. Human evaluation is only conducted on 50 samples from Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenarios. What languages do these 50 samples come from? What is the quality of the translation of the responses? 50 samples seem too small for human evaluation and to make a statement about multilingual performance of LLMs. Moreover, it\u2019s unclear if we can trust chatGPT on other scenarios in the taxonomy.\n\n- While this is not a major weakness, the authors tried to provide some estimate about the percentage of language data in each LLMs. While I appreciate this effort, I don\u2019t think Table 4 makes sense. Training data for GPT-2 is **NOT** the training data for chatGPT. And PALM2 training data is **NOT** the training data of PALM. Thus that information is not relevant at all in the paper.\n\n- Finally, I have a meta-concern/question about the setup. If culture specific is removed from the safety benchmark then is it an interesting problem to study? If everything can be mapped to English and the model chooses to respond or not based on its safeguard then is it just a machine translation problem? In the experiment when the prompt asks chatGPT to think in English then answer, is it just a specific instance of implicit translation?"

There is a possibility that translating this data across cultures would result in it not being representative of the harms that appear in those cultures. There is a good example of removing the China-specific safety questions from the Sun et al. dataset.\n2. There is a manual evaluation of 50 instances only from the Crimes and Illegal Activities and Goal Hijacking scenario indicating 94% accuracy, and it is not clear what language the model was queried in. This is a small number on a very limited subset of the data, so I am not sure how trustworthy this accuracy number is.\n3.

The proposed prompting methods lack novelty and, as mentioned in the footnote on page 8, they only exhibit marginal improvements on models other than ChatGPT. While these three models are less safe than ChatGPT and have a higher demand for safety, as demonstrated in Table 5, the effectiveness of these methods is limited.\n\n3. Ensuring accurate annotation in a multilingual dataset is a challenging task that requires a rigorous verification process. However, the annotation process employed by XSAFETY and the validation of automatic evaluation lack essential details for standard data validation, such as cross-validation, and inter-annotator agreement.\n\n4.
