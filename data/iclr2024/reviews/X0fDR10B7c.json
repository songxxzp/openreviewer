It's not stated in the main text.\n\t- Results in section 3.2. For which experiment are these results of? It seems its only for counterfactual queries.\n\t- Figures like fig 4, fig 5, and fig 6 have too much information from too many results. These results can also be presented in much cleaner formats. For example, in structure learning the mean squared error of the learned and actual adjacency averaged over multiple runs would be much more informative than simply showing the adjacency for two graphs.\n\t- Figures 15- 20: Its unclear for what tasks and under which data generation regime these results are for.\n\t- Figures 8 -14: I can't see these referenced anywhere and so it is entirely unclear what these are showing.\n\n\n- Another main weakness is that while it is interesting that it is possible to perform causal queries with PC, what is the obvious advantage? For causal queries, contradictory to the claims made in the paper, its not obvious that the PC approach is more efficient (see below). For structure learning, why would PC perform better than other maximum likelihood methods?

I believe this is the case as a different error has to be zeroed out. If so, is this not very inefficient? This is not the case if interventional queries are found by doing graph mutilations.  \n- Classification task: A lot more detail is needed for this to be clear. It is simply stated that \"we perform an intervention on the input\" but its not clear what this means. An intervention in a causal sense means, putting in another input which will change the label as well. If you mean zeroing out the errors of the input nodes, this needs to be made clear. \"Intervention\" has a very specific meaning in causal literature. The Appendix has insufficient details. \n- Structure learning: Has the data been normalised? If not, this should be mentioned and compared against standardised data in line with [1]\n\nMinor points:\n- X_unk is never formally defined\n- Appendix is a bit messy.\n\t- Took a while to find where the non-linear data generation was as Appendix D is never referred to in any of the text.\n\t- Final line in discussion in page 20: This seems slightly misleading, the data in all cases is generated with additive Gaussian noise, whereas the methods discussed are specifically designed to deal with Non-Gaussian distributions.\n\n- How does predictive coding handle a single dataset? All the theory in the paper assumes access to a single datapoint.\n- Section 3, Interventional query: \"...perform an intervention\", what variable the intervention on? It's not clear here\n- Section 2.1: What is time step t refering to? It has not been defined.\n- Given that each x_i is a node in the (causal) graph, how is it possible to use deeper neural networks (eq 1) to learn the relationship between observed variables? The current formulation seems to limit the relationship between variables to 1 layer NNs.\n- If generated from non linear data, the counterfactual queries are not identifiable, how does the method handle this?\n\n[1] Reisach, Alexander, Christof Seiler, and Sebastian Weichwald. \"Beware of the simulated dag! causal discovery benchmarks may be easy to game.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems"

The claim right before it \"This approach obviates the need for explicit adjustment formulas and back-door criteria in\ncausal inference.\" is misleading and hints at a contribution where there isn't one. If I understand correctly, the claim is true simply as an immediate consequence of the \"truncated factorization\" (Pearl 2009, Eq 1.37) when no hidden confounders are involved. In this case, there is no need for back-door adjustments or other similar things already by standard causal inference. \n- Same for Sec 2. Causal graph is defined wrongly or incomplete at least; the Markov factorization is not what makes an CBN, since it applies to standard BNs. See definitions of CBN in eg [Pearl, 2009, Definition 1.3.1] , it's about all interventional distributions having the Markov fact. and other constraints. \n- What are the assumptions in the part before 2.1  \"Posterior distribution\" ? The method is presented in the intro/abstract as very general but here we seem to require Gaussian assumptions, unit variances, mean field approximations .. all these in text and not presented properly mathematically (see comment above too). Is the setting the same as Peters et al (see below reference) ? \n- At start of 2.1 you say you will use SGD for optimizing ( I guess F from Eq 2) - why SGD ? This is a simple least squares objective to optimize and simpler (faster) alternatives exist. Unless I'm missing something but again not very formally presented, there is no clear optimization problem stated with argmins etc. \n- For discovery you use the method of Zhang et al (2018) - again where is the novelty here ? Is PC used to propose a different method or not ? \n\n\nReferences \n- Peters, J. and B\u00fchlmann, P., 2014. Identifiability of Gaussian structural equation models with equal error variances.
