This framework harnesses active querying to efficiently extract information from a language model. Remarkably, the proposed method can tweak its queries to be relevant even with slight alterations to existing agents, ensuring that previously acquired information is both retained and effectively repurposed. The examined issue is both relevant and significant. Agents equipped with the ability to tap into external knowledge repositories exhibit enhanced capability and safety over their counterparts. The integration of LLMs with assistance-seeking mechanisms is a novel endeavor. The results outperform the established baseline, and diverse experimental setups have been designed to underscore the method's efficacy."

The core concept is inspired by human behavior, where individuals often seek additional information before taking action, thereby avoiding unnecessary trial and error. The ABA approach empowers agents to inquire proactively using natural language, enhancing their interaction within various environments. The paper begins by acknowledging the proficiency of LLMs in various tasks but highlights their inefficiency in environments with limited or ambiguous information. The ABA methodology is introduced as a solution, allowing agents to ask open-ended questions to gather essential information, leading to more efficient and informed decision-making. This approach is distinct from previous works that often restricted interactions or required human intervention for providing information. To further enhance ABA's performance, the authors introduce ABA-FT, which reformulates metadata associated with question formulation, helping the model understand the rationale behind asking questions. This fine-tuning process leads to notable improvements, especially in challenging tasks."

Is there a necessity to use Contextual MDP? I hope the authors can further explain the motivation.\n- The paper's methodology heavily relies on the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). I think the method itself does not make much sense. From my point of view, it seems just like the authors design some tasks with ambiguity and use the \"ask before action\" paradigm to help solve such ambiguity. But the model does not resolve such ambiguity by itself, i.e., through rapid trial-and-error. On the other hand, it still depends on the human to help it. So why not the human provide the complete information at the beginning? Besides, I don't see the proposed \"ask before action\" paradigm as a big contribution, as we have already see many works related to the LLM agency in which LLMs are driven to finish more complex interactions and tasks.\n- There lacks error analysis conducted on instances where ABA underperformed or failed. What insights were derived from these analyses?  Besides, I think additional QA in ABA actually imports more information compared with other baselines, which definitely lead to better performance. Maybe other baselines should also use information like \u201cthe second red block from the left\u201d for a equal comparison."
