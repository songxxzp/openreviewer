                "value": "The paper proposes a novel architecture for coordinate-based networks used for signal representation. The key contribution of this architecture is that the activation function is changed to a sinusoidal function multiplied by a damping function. This result leads to improvement over existing activations which either use ReLU, and have a spectral bias towards low-frequency functions, or use sinusoidal activations, which do not have a notion of locality due to the lack of damping factor and thus lead to poorer reconstructions. This contribution is justified empirically by showing that it leads to significantly better signal fits on image signals."

The activation function and possible choices are explained very well, and the reasoning for the chosen function is justified intuitively, and there are theoretical guarantees on the Lipschitz constant of the function represented by the network. I view this as very valuable as the paper can have more impact if researchers understand the reason for the increase in performance, as this is under-explored area of activation functions in coordinate-based networks.\n2. The comparisons show that the proposed SPDER activation function leads to significant improvement over positional encoding, SIREN, and ReLU networks in signal memorization tasks. This shows that the relatively simple contribution does lead to an improvement in what is claimed, and has the potential to be impactful."

                "value": "In my opinion, the weaknesses of the paper are:\n1. I think that additional experiments could be used as there are other coordinate-based network architectures which claim improvements over positional encoding and SIREN architectures. I'm not sure why Instant-NGP is chosen here, as it is a hybrid implicit-explicit representation and is very different from the other coordinate-based networks. I believe a better fit would be [1] or [2], which show that simple networks with different activations, structures, or positional embeddings can improve on the FF/SIREN architectures. \n2. Following the additional experiments thread, I'm not sure why comparisons on radiance field fitting are not included. While interesting as a toy problem, image signal representation is not very useful in many computer vision tasks, besides maybe super-resolution. However, coordinate-based networks have been very useful in computer graphics, where they can be used in solving inverse problems and reconstructing 3D from 2D. Not including an experiment on radiance field, which is the most impactful field where an improvement in coordinate-based network fitting would be utilized, leads me to believe that the impact of the method is severely limited due to some unknown reason, perhaps speed or memory constraints in the architecture?\n3. Even simpler than radiance field fitting, I don't understand why there is no experiment on overfitting 3D shapes, such as SDFs? This is where coordinate-based networks originated, and could be used as a compressive representation. The paper mentions compressive signal representations in the conclusion, but there is no study on how effective SPDER is for this - no study on memory consumption, or size of networks needed to reach an acceptable level of quality. This is usually done when trying to represent 3D objects with SDFs, so this leads me to believe the method may have some limitations here.\n\n[1] https://openreview.net/forum?id=OmtmcPkkhT\n\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01553"

                "value": "I do not have any additional questions on the paper, as it is described very clearly. Overall, I think that the contribution of the paper is strong due to its simplicity and demonstrated improvement on image-signal overfitting tasks. However, I think that the evaluations are limited - there are other coordinate-based network architectures which lead to improvement over the baselines which are compared to here, and most importantly, the method is not compared on radiance fields, which is the most impactful application of coordinate-based networks. I think that addressing these two weaknesses would make the paper significantly stronger and in that case I would be happy to raise my score.\n\n**Update after author response**\n\nAfter reading the author response, I am not inclined to change my score. While I appreciate the additional comparisons, and I believe the paper does a convincing job showing that overfitting image signals can be done extremely well with SPDER, I think the paper weakness is justifying *why* this is a relevant problem. The method seems to not work on radiance fields, has not been shown to work on SDFs, nor am I sure it offers compression benefits in overfitting image signals. Thus, I'm not sure what application it would be used in. On the other hand, there is no theoretical proof that it is able to encode a wider frequency band of signals, only empirical results on a relatively narrow range of experiments. With further work, I believe the paper could make a meaningful contribution, but in this state I remain borderline."

I am concerned that this method tends to overfit heavily and easily to a given particular input image/signal, and evidence for generalization was very limited to (as far as I can tell) a single video example. How sensitive is the model to noise in the input, for example? This can be important for real-world applications.\n\n2. I am not an expert in this space, but one question I have is whether the baselines are strong. SIREN is the most commonly used baseline. Maybe the authors can provide some perspective in this regard.\n\nLastly, I would recommend the authors, in the spirit of academic inquiry, to tone down the language a little bit. An example is a statement of the form: \"We demonstrate how SPDER not only has incredibly low loss\", can be restated as \"We demonstrate how SPDER not only has significantly lower loss\" etc. This is a minor point, admittedly my personal taste."
