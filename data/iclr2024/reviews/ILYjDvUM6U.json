This demonstrates that UAICRL is more robust and has superior performance compared to other methods.\"\n\n**Illegible figures**\nMost figures are illegible due to being too small and the font size being too low.\nThis needs to be fixed before publication.\n\n\n**Conclusion is very short..**\nThe conclusion is very short and feels rushed. Surely the authors have more to say here??\n\n**Bolding**\nWhat does the bolding in the tables show? Does it show statistical significance from a statistical test or something else? This should be clarified somewhere in the text.\n\n**Code**\nThere is no README file in the code supplement so it is not clear how to setup the environment or how to run the experiments.\nIt would be good to at least have a notebook to see how the code/method works in practice.\n\nIn my opinion, the paper highlights an important problem, has a good technical contribution and has results which support the claims.\nHowever, I do not think the paper can be published until:\n- The experiments section is made clearer\n- The figures are made legible\n- The conclusion is written properly\n\n**Minor corrections**:\n- The paper has many textual citations in parentheses. For example \"(Liu et al., 2023; Papadimitriou et al., 2023)\" in paragraph 3. You should use \\citet instead of \\citep to remove the parentheses.\n- In Section 2, what is $\\mathcal{M}^{c_{\\omega}}$? It's not defined anywhere.\n- Figure 1.\n  - The text is way too small.\n  - It's also not clear where to start reading from. I think you should start reading from $\\mathcal{D}_{e}$ so perhaps this should be mentioned in the caption.\n- Page 3 footnote is missing a full stop.\n- Section 4.2\n  - $\\mathcal{T}$ is never formally introduced.\n  - $F(\\cdot)$ is overloaded and confusing as it is shown as $F(\\tau)$, $F(s_{t})$ and $F(s,a)$. I think you should distinguish the state flow $F(s_{t})$ from the trajectory flow function.\n- Algorithm 1:\n  - Does \"sample nominal trajectories\" imply interacting with the environment? If so, I would explicitly state this.\n  - Is it right that the augmented data is discarded at each iteration?\n- Table 1 text is way too small\n- Figure 2 needs larger text\n- Figures 3/4/5/D.3/D.4/D.5/D.6\n  - Larger text\n  - It only needs one legend.\n  - The x-axis ticks are too close\n  - The plot titles don't all need to say \"with noise $\\mathcal{N}(0,0.1)$\"\n- Figure 6 is not clear.\n  - Each column refers to a grid world scenario so this should be on the figure and/or mentioned in the caption.\n  - The text is way too small\n  - What are the constraints locations???\n  - Where does the agent start/end?\n- Figure 7 is not clear.\n  - Each column refers to a grid world scenario so this should be on the figure and/or mentioned in the caption.\n  - What does each row represent? Is the top row ICRL and the bottom row UAICRL? This needs to be made clearer."
