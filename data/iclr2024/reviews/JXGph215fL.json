This makes the algorithms more efficient and more suitable for games where most information is non-public. The authors further tested the proposed approach in the Hanabi game, and demonstrated the advantage of the approach."

Is there an iterative updating process where a new policy is used in each time step $t$? \n\n- It is said that squiggly arrows are used to indicate randomness in the output. When you write $U_Q^{global} : \\Delta(\\mathbb{A}_i) \\times \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathbb{A}_i|} \\rightsquigarrow \\Delta(\\mathbb{A}_i)$, the output is already a distribution over $\\mathbb{A}_i$.

It seems undefined. What is $G$ samples in the algorithm?"

To address this issue, this paper introduces a framework for decision-time planning, focusing on the idea of update equivalence rather than subgames. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms, when applied to Hanabi, 3x3 Abrupt Dark Hex, and Phantom Tic-Tac-Toe, either match or surpass state-of-the-art methods."
