I have concerns regarding the soundness of the paper's evaluation methodology.\nThe proposed method hinges on the assumption that a data instance is contaminated in an LLM if the LLM can complete the instance based on its prefix. The paper's evaluation primarily revolves around how well the proposed methods are compared to human experts under this assumption However, these concerns raise doubts about whether the underlying assumption holds for several reasons.\n(1) The inability of an LLM to complete a reference does not necessarily imply that the instance was not used during training. It could be attributed to model forgetting or the model's failure to memorize surface-level features while still having learned the semantic-level features of the data instance. This could lead to a high false negative rate in the evaluation.\n(2) An LLM may have encountered the input of a data instance without having seen the actual data instance itself. For instance, in sentiment classification tasks, text can be included in the LLM's training set as long as its label is not provided alongside the text. The ability to complete the input text does not necessarily indicate data contamination in LLMs, potentially resulting in a high false positive rate.\n(3) The unavailability of training data details for ChatGPT and GPT-4 due to their proprietary nature prevents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. The current evaluation primarily focuses on how closely the proposed model aligns with human guess about data contamination, in cases where the actual training data is undisclosed. It seems essential to assess the method on models with publicly accessible training data, such as OpenLlama.\n2. There's a potential fairness issue in using GPT-4 to evaluate the prediction from itself."
