The relationship between data selection and data augmentation within the proposed framework for robustness needs further elaboration.\n\n- To ensure trustworthiness, the authors propose to train the model using a subset of the training data points. Does the trustworthy model have lower accuracy compared to the model trained on the original dataset? It would be interesting if the authors could theoretically analyze the impact of the data selection on the accuracy of the trained model.\n\n- In their experiment, the authors evaluate the proposed framework's performance in terms of fairness and robustness independently. How does the framework perform when both fairness and robustness are considered together?\n\n- The efficiency analysis of the proposed framework is missing.

For efficiency, the data selection is done online with the iterative OMP algorithm, where data are chosen in a greedy manner, and the incoming data is decided to be added on the go by comparing with the already selected subset. In the case of the reached budget, incoming data can replace the already chosen one as well only if the incoming data can improve the online sparse approximation value. The authors also provide conditions for the selection of an optimal set of data. This work is said to be the first to attempt the problem of online sparse approximation for data selection. The experiments show good performance for fairness and robustness cases."
