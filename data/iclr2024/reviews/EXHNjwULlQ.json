The writing is not particularly clear, the clarity of the exposition can be much improved still.\n- While there are many classification models the method is applied on in the experiments, there is only single data augmentation baseline that is compared against. The difference in performance does not seem significant. The paper also does not contain any comparisons to numbers in the literature, which makes it difficult to judge how good the results are in the first place. Since no per-dataset numbers are provided, it is unclear how large the variance between multiple repeats is. I would especially like to see a comparison against Chen et al. (2023), since they propose a very similar idea where features are swapped between samples (their Feat-Mix variant). The authors would benefit from elaborating on the similarities and differences further than the small paragraph in the current version of the paper, considering the similarity in terms of approach. Chen et al don't evaluate their Feat-Mix with other architectures, but in principle I believe it should apply just the same as the proposed approach here.\n- It would be good to have a statistical analysis of whether the differences between models are statistically significant, for example using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests, see [1]\n\n[1] https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/demsar06a/demsar06a.pdf"

A feature selection model $g$ is used to assign per-feature weights for each example. The weight of an example for the mixed up vector is the sum of weight of the features used from that example in the mix. These weights are used to construct a loss function during training, with added regularization terms to avoid uniform feature weight assignment. The weights are also employed during evaluation by linearly mixing the prediction with the output from a weighted version of the feature. The work proposes a transfer learning scheme where the feature importance model $g$ is first pre-trained alongside a differentiable MLP (as the main predictor). The importance model is then used on black-box classifiers such as gradient boosted decision trees. The empirical results show that the proposed method applied on top of current SOTA improves the results on standard benchmark datasets."

More concretely,  it's missing (1) a clear definition the problem of interest, (2) why the problem is of interest to the community, (3) what methods have prior works proposed and why these methods don't address the problem of interest, and (4) How the proposed method improves upon prior these prior works. Here is my current understanding of the context:\n* The problem of interest: training neural models with unstructured tabular data.\n* Why the problem is interesting (motivation): unclear.\n* Prior works: discussed in related work, but should also be discussed in the intro. \n* Core novelty: this is the first work to *learn* a mixing augmentation function for *tabular* problems.\nPlease let me know if these short descriptions are generally correct. Further detail on these four points would help me better understand the better and also provide more feedback during the review period.\n\n1. I found the method description to be a bit haphazard and hard to follow. A figure illustrating the flow of information in training $g$ and $f$ as well as the method's novelties would be very helpful. The algorithmic details are clear, but the motivation behind these details is unclear to me. Please see the Question section my question related to the algorithm. \n1. Section 3 also introduce many new variables which makes it difficult to follow. If it's possible to consolidate notation, that would help immensely with readability. For instance, in Eq 1, the authors may consider replacing $m_i^u$ with $g(x_i)$ and then stating that gradients do not backpropagate through $g$ (analogous for $m_j^u$). \n1. It seems the empirical analysis does not compare the proposed mixup method with existing mixup-style methods. This method should at least be compared to a naive, unweighted mixup strategy.\n\nOverall, I vote to reject. The proposed mixup method does seem to accomplish what the paper claims it should accomplish (as seen by Figure 1 and 3), but the paper is quite difficult to follow, much of the algorithm is missing justification, and lacks relevant baselines.\n\n**Other minor comments:**\n\n1. $a$ and $b$ are not defined in Eq. 1.\n1. In Table 1, its difficult to identify the top performing methods. I suggest bolding/highlighting the best methods. \n1. I prefer the term \"augmented sample\" over \"virtual sample\" as is emphasizes that the data was generated using a data augmentation function.\n1. Notation for the Hadamard product is defined After Eq 2 in Section 3 but is used throughout the intro."

I don't quite understand Eq. 3. Why this loss? At a high-level, what is the goal of the learned mixing model? What sorts of mixtures does it aim to generate? Is this loss applied only to virtual samples (if so, please use $\\bar{x}$ instead of $x$ here).\n1. Is the \"weighted sample $dg(x) \\circ x$\" the sample thing as a virtual sample $\\bar{x}$? If so, I suggest rewriting as \"virtual sample $\\bar{x} = dg(x) \\circ x$\n1. Why do we want to prevent uniformity?\n1. The loss in Eq. 4 can be minimized by updated $g$ such that just a single entry of $m$ large and the rest are uniform. Is this the intended effect?\n1. The first contribution mentions that the proposed method operates in the input domain. Could the authors explain why this detail is important?\n1. The paper mentions that the proposed method is suitable for unstructured data, but it is not clear to me what is meant by \"unstructured.\" Could the authors please explain?"

The first paragraph of Sec.1 reads, \"... we develop a data mixing (Guo et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2021) technique ...\".\n- The proposed technique is not subject to theoretical analysis, nor is an intuitive picture explained. \n    - it is hard to judge the applicability of the proposed technique, learning a network $g$ for data mixing, in general scenarios. It is possible that $g$ overfits and degrades the resulting $f$.\n    - the authors claim their technique is \"architecture-agnostic.\" However, for more complex $f$, simple MLP-based $g$ may not be able to capture its behavior (recall that $g$ is trained to replicate the logits of $f$). It is interesting to ask how the architecture of $g$ will affect the performance. \n    - why should we expect that the feature weight is beneficial during inference?  \n- The presentation of ideas could be better organized and clearer. \n    - there lacks a description of how to co-train the two networks, $f$ and $g$, \n    - In Sec. 3, it is unclear what the authors mean by stating, \"... we sum the weights assigned by network g that are associated with the relevant coordinates of each sample\". A mathematical expression would be helpful.\n        - as features chosen from the two samples are non-overlapping, do the authors mean that we add the corresponding weights of two samples regardless of whether the feature is selected for constructing the virtual sample?\n    - Eq. 1, a summation ranges from $u=a$ to $b$. However, there is no definition for $a$ and $b$.\n    - Eq. 3, the symbol $dg$ could be confusing; it may be better to write it as $d*g$"

It is interesting to ask whether the proposed technique also shows competing performance on different types of data, e.g., images, compared to other feature mixing methods.\n- how would the performance change when adopting different architectures for $g$\n- how are the two networks, $f$ and $g$, co-trained in detail?\n- it seems one can also use a differentiable loss for $\\mathcal{L}_m$, e.g., the entropy, which encourages the weights to concentrate on one particular element of $m$.  If adopting, say, the entropy as $\\mathcal{L}_m$, how would the resulting network $g$ be affected?"
