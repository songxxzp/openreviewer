Unlike previous techniques, TNT fine-tunes models using negative examples generated by the model itself, with the goal of closely aligning the updated model's distribution to the original while avoiding specific undesired behaviors. The method operates by minimizing reverse KL-divergence, ensuring the updated model does not deviate significantly from its initial training. Experiments demonstrate that TNT effectively maintains original model performance better than other negative training approaches while reducing unwanted behaviors. However, it requires access to the original model and detailed token-level annotations, presenting potential practical challenges. TNT's iterative nature also suggests it could be used to enhance model safety over time through continuous refinement."

TNT's flexibility is also less than that of NADO as it requires auxiliary negative annotation, which is a closer setup to that of the FUDGE algorithm [NAACL 2021, https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05218].\n\n - Oversight in Literature Review: Even if TNT can differ itself from NADO and FUDGE (since the two previous methods study different tasks, yet essentially with similar mathematical setup), the absence of a citation and/or discussion of these existing works suggests a possible gap in the literature review process, which might question the thoroughness of the background research conducted for the paper."

The paper demonstrates their technique on some relatively easier benchmarks, and it would be much more interesting to try more complicated schemes. There are three ways in which I find them weak\n    - In the specific case where p_neg is defined as the presence of a bad token in the string, there is no need to do any training, and by simply ignoring bad tokens at decoding, one recovers the true optimal solution for both greedy and temperature decoding with zero overhead. Both the toxicity and hallucinations benchmarks provided in this text are dangerously close to \"reject any sentence with a bad (word/entity)\", which makes the application rather uninteresting. It would be cooler to see benchmarks where the reward model may still be automated but captures some global property of the sentence that requires a learning-based technique such as yours to solve.\n    - For the toxicity benchmark, the authors mention that 1.6% of the time, the completion is toxic. I believe a very natural baseline to this problem is performing temperature 1 decoding and regenerating anytime the output is toxic. I get the sense this will very rarely require few regenerations for this specific benchmark, making the learning rather excessive. Having a benchmark that requires a larger change will be a true test of this problem.\n   - For baselines, as mentioned in Weakness 1, I believe PPO is a more natural baseline for learning from a reward model\n\nOverall, I believe the work can better demonstrate the technique."

If only 1.6% of model generations were toxic, would the model get any gradient signal for 98.4% of the generations?\n\n2. Why is TNRLL not called TNFR?\n\n3. Just to be clear, does \"token level annotations\" refer to a function that can take a sentence and assess whether it is negative or positive? This was not super clear to me, even though there were a few sentences dedicated to it on page 4. If it is a function, it might be better specified as such."

Otherwise the objective minimizes a divergence between the original and the learned model distribution.\n3. The authors explore different instantiations of divergences: (forward KL, forward KL), (reverse KL, reverse KL) and (reverse KL, forward KL) for the (negative token signal, positive token signal), which they dub (D_{n}, D_{p}) respectively. In addition to that, they also explore with (forward KL, maximum likelihood) and (reverse KL, maximum likelihood) for (D_{n}, D_{p}).\n4.

Concretely, similar to the TNFLL and TNRLL rows, it would also be good to have an equivalent row for TNFF, TNRR and TNRF.\n2. From Table 1, for both the TNFLL and TNRLL approaches, the performance is considerably worse compared to the baseline method. For TNFLL, it the hallucination rate is substantially higher, while for TNRLL, the BLEU score is much lower. Given this observation, I am hesitant to believe that the proposed approach is actually substantially than the baseline approach.\n3. In my opinion, intuitively, because this approach minimizes the KL at a prefix level, especially considering the fact that the annotations obtained are from a noisy source, it is possible that this approach would steer the model towards not predicting certain words in certain contexts. Concretely, (based from the example in Figure 5), for the sentence \"In some regions of the country, the sex ratio is still quite concerning\", because the annotations are noisy, the word \"sex\" would be (incorrectly) marked as offensive. Consequently, because of the proposed objective, the model might not be able to produce the token \"sex\" for a similar prefix as \"In some regions of the country, the\", even if it did make sense in the context. I think this is a reasonably big limitation of the approach, and it would have been nice to have some discussion on this in the paper."
