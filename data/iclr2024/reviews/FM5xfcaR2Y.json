                "value": "1. It is not mentioned how nonbinary sensitive attributes are handled.\n\n\t- Related: How is the sensitive attribute of \"race\" in the COMPAS experiments, which can be one of three categories (African-American, Caucasian, Other), handled?\n\n1. I am skeptical about the scalability of the proposed method to large datasets and more sensitive attributes.  It appears that the time complexity would scale exponentially in the number of sensitive attributes, i.e., $M^{K}$.\n\n\t- I see that $M$, the number of samples on which the decision boundaries are considered, is set to no more than 5000 in the experiments.  But practical ML datasets nowadays can contain tens of thousands to millions of examples.\n\t- Could the authors also report and compare the running time of their code?\n\t- Also, if $M<N_\\textrm{val}$ is used for selecting the boundaries, then there should be a term involving $M$ in Theorem 2 (more on Theorem 2 below)?\n\n1. Theorem 2 is very important as it provides fairness guarantees for the classifier obtained through the procedure.  But the result looks wrong to me, and seems to have a discrepancy with Algorithm 1.  The proof is also very hard to read, containing several typos.\n\n\t- DP should depend on $\\epsilon_p$ (attributed to the error in $\\hat p(A=1\\mid X$), but this dependency is absent in eq. 14.  Digging into the proof, I see that it is hidden with the statement that \"$\\epsilon=\\epsilon_1+\\epsilon_2$, and assume that it is smaller than $\\delta/2$\".  Why is this assumption justified?\n\t- In the paragraph preceding eq. 15, what is $\\hat Y_{t'}$?  Should it be $\\check Y_{t'}$?  And what is $\\check Y_{t'}^*$ in the paragraph following eq. 15?  Should it be $\\check Y_{t'}$?\n\t- Following the above, I don't get why $DP(\\check Y_{t'})+\\epsilon \\leq \\delta$ but not $3\\delta/2$, given that \"let $t'$ corresponds to... under the constraint that $DP(\\check Y_{t'})\\leq \\delta-\\epsilon$\".\n\t- I don't get why $DP(\\check Y_{\\hat t})\\leq \\delta -\\epsilon_1$, how is $\\check Y_{\\hat t}$ related to $\\check Y_{t'}$?\n\t- Finally, Theorem 2 only proves results for DP.  What about EO, EOp, and composite criteria?\n\t- Please also justify the assumptions made; are they practical?\n\n1. In the experiments, the authors compared their proposed post-processing algorithm to ones that are attribute-aware, but their algorithm is run in attribute-unaware mode.  The authors should have compared to those algorithms by running their algorithm in the same attribute-aware mode.  In this sense, the current set of experiments is incomplete.\n\n1. The conclusions drawn from the ablation study in section D.2 do no make sense to me.  How is accuracy related to the error $\\mathbb E|\\hat p(A=1\\mid X) - p(A=1\\mid X)|$ in Theorem 2?  In fact, regularization could in fact be reducing the aforementioned error despite huring accuracy.  One way to measure this is, e.g., using reliability diagrams.  The conclusion in D.2 that \"this further confirms the robustness of our post-processing modification algorithm\" does not make sense.\n\n1. Some clarifications would be helpful:\n\n\t- Example 3 does not imply subgroup fairness, i.e., intersecting groups.\n\t- When introducing the composite criterion, it is also useful to mention that some fairness criteria are incompatible with each other (e.g., DP vs. EO).\n\n1.

Standard methods for fairness through post-processing come up with a predictor that takes the sensitive attribute as input, and therefore, requires access to sensitive attributes at test time. This is not desirable because, in practice, laws and regulation might prohibit access to sensitive information. This paper introduces a new post-processing method that does not require this access; instead, it works with a conditional distribution of sensitive attributes (conditioned on all other features). More formally, let $(X,A,Y)$ represent features, sensitive attributes, and labels. Given a base classifier $\\hat{Y} (X)$, a conditional distribution $\\hat{P} (A,Y|X)$, the paper introduces an efficient algorithm that gives us a new classifier $\\hat{Y}\u2019 (X)$ that satisfies a desired notion of fairness, while approximately preserving the accuracy of $\\hat{Y}$. They experiment with their proposed algorithm on Adult, COMPAS and CelebA data sets and find that in most cases their proposed algorithm outperforms (some) existing fair learning algorithms."

It is not clear if this complies with laws and regulations: a company can still use their model of $P(A|X)$ to get good estimates of individual\u2019s sensitive attribute. I\u2019d like to see a discussion of this in the paper as well.\n\n-Overall, the assumption that we have access to $P(Y, A|X)$, or a good estimate of it, could be strong in practice. For example, if I know a good estimate for $P(Y|X)$, I might as well use that as my predictor. Also, how are these conditional distributions learned? In practice, we observe every $x$ only once, so these probabilities are 0 or 1 on observed data, unless we work with parametric models like logistic regression. But which parametric model should we use here when the underlying unknown data distribution could be arbitrary? Also, how are these models chosen in your experiments?\n\n-The paper claims that the performance of their method is better than \u201cin-processing methods\u201d. Is it better than all in-processing methods or just a few? This sounds like a very strong claim because, generally speaking, in-processing methods do achieve better performance than post-processing methods. Additionally, the most popular in-processing method for fair learning is given by Agarwal et al. 2018 (titled: \"A reductions approach to fair classification\"). Unfortunately, their algorithm is not included in the benchmarks for experiments. I would like to see a comparison of the two methods."

In practice we only have a pre-trained classifier and do not necessarily have pre-trained conditional distributions. If your method allows using the same validation set to learn these distributions, then all you\u2019d need is the pre-trained classifier, increasing the flexibility of the proposed method.\n\n-The title of the paper seems misleading. What does \u201coptimal\u201d mean here? Post-processing algorithms are known to be sub-optimal in general because their guarantees are benchmarked against the base classifier (e.g., see your theorem on page 7). Theoretically, in-processing methods achieve the optimal tradeoff between accuracy and fairness because they directly solve the constrained optimization problem instead of looking at the specific class of models that are derived by post-processing another model. This does need a clarification in the paper.\n\n-Why does Hardt et al. (2016) have lower performance than your proposed method in the experiments? Hardt. et al. (2016) solves the same post-processing problem with the extra flexibility that the sensitive attribute can be used as an input to the model.

The paper proposes a post-hoc approach to achieve this. \n\nFor binary classifiers: First, an unconstrained Bayes optimal classifier (Y'(X)), which maximizes accuracy, is learned. Then post-hoc, a modification rule is used to obtain a fairness constrained Bayes optimal classifier (Y''(X)) by modifying the output of Y'(X). This modification is done by mapping each instance to a probability with which the fairness constrained classifier disagrees with the unconstrained classifier. \n\nThe paper proposes a definition of such a modification rule which is defined by an instance-level bias score which the authors propose, together with a measure of the uncertainty of the unconstrained classifier on a given instance. \n\nThe authors propose definitions of the bias score for each of three popular fairness constraints, and show how the resulting modification rules leads to classifiers that satisfy the fairness constraints. The authors point out that unlike previous works, their approach enables us to find classifiers satisfying Equalized Odds fairness constraints."

While this approach has been previously studied, I believe the instance-level bias scores are novel.\n- The main significant technical contribution is the ability to satisfy Equalized Odds fairness constraints.\n- Besides these, the characterization of the optimal modification rule in Theorem 1, which has the form of a linear combination of bias scores, one for each protected attribute is also very interesting. In particular, this enables the approach in Section 3 where together with an auxiliary model that estimates the values for the protected attributes, the bias score for examples in the test set can be computed without access to the values of the protected attributes.\n- Together, I think the conceptual and technical contributions are both interesting and significant, and the topic is clearly relevant to ICLR and the research community working on fairness in ML."
