            "questions": {
                "value": "### **Main concerns**\nMy main concern is that the provided comparison with baselines doesn't help to create a convincing picture of the superiority of the proposed RL-based approach over standard attention-based sequential learning models. The key limitation of the work is that non-RL baseline algorithms significantly differ from the proposed solution. There are several aspects in which this difference is crucial in the view of understanding the true contribution of RL. First of all, the loss function. The proposed solution (as well as several RL baselines that the authors use) utilizes full cross-entropy (CE) loss (the actor part), while the original SASRec model uses binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This change alone provides a significant difference in the learning of proper data distribution. BCE serves is a very rough approximation for learning underlying data structure, it significantly depends on the negative sampling strategy. In the case of SASRec it's based on a uniform sampling with a single negative example being drawn for each positive interaction. This is a very strict limitation on data exploration part. So at least two modifications must be introduced into the non-RL SASRec model before comparing to the RL models:\n1) increasing the number of negative samples in BCE,\n2) switching from BCE to CE loss.\n\nThese changes are self-evident and must be easy to implement considering that the architecture of the proposed solution already has the necessary components.  Nevertheless, the work by [Klenitskiy and Vasilev 2023] may also be helpful in the context of the current paper as the authors perform a direct comparison of SASRec with different loss functions that include BCE, CE and subsampled CE. Similar results regarding the advantages of CE loss were obtained in e.g., [Frolov et al. 2023]. Some work related to improving negative sampling in BCE was also done by [Petrov and Macdonald 2023]. Most importantly, these works demonstrate a significant improvement over the baseline SASRec model and therefore the comparison with the modified version of SASRec (not just its basic implementation) is absolutely necessary. \n\nAnother concern is related to identifying and quantifying the training instability issue. It also connects to the previous concern as, for example, the instability in the case of SASRec can arise from the reinforced bias against true negative samples induced by BCE loss (which is only an approximation for learning data distribution as stated above). To make comparison more reliable and informative, the learning curves for the SASRec model with full CE loss (at least) are necessary. \n\nMoreover, the figures provided to demonstrate the effect of training instability are truncated to only the first 50 iterations of training. Considering the slow-paced learning of the proposed model, the graph is not convincing. What happens at e.g., 200 iterations (200 iterations is a moderate number that is met across many models)? Does the method still behave in a stable fashion? From the current figure it can only be stated that it's more stable only within the first 50 iterations. But if it degrades afterwards than the method provides no advantage, it only postpones the problem till later time. In addition to that, the quality of the proposed approach does not seem to be higher. It's hard to see from the graph on Figure 3, though, some horizontal lines emphasizing the maximum achieved metric value would help visual analysis. Anyway, at least in some figures, other methods seem to achieve the highest quality faster (e.g., for NDCG metric), which will completely diminish advantages of the proposed approach if it also suffers from instabilities but at a later stage (higher number of iterations).\n\nThe third major concern is related to the overall methodology of experiments. First of all, it's not clear what metric was used to validate the models? Connecting it to the previous point, if the target metric was HR and the model shows higher HR at the cost of lower NDCG, it may signify an overfitting problem of the approach. Secondly, in sequential learning it's critical to avoid data leakage. A widespread problem with many works including SASRec is that they use leave-last-out scheme to hide target items for test and validation, which inevitably leads to recommendations-from-future type of leaks. See e.g. [Ji at el 2023] for more details on proper splitting. In addition to that, while the authors provide a link to the source code repository, the repository is empty, which raises reproducibility concerns.\n\nThe current work seems to have an even more significant leakage problem as target items are held out randomly, not even according to the sequential order. This makes the results look weak. Another issue related to the evaluation setup is the target items subsampling used to calculate the metrics, in which the ground truth item is ranked agains only a small subsample of negative examples instead of entire catalog. This scheme leads to various estimation biases (see [Ca\u00f1amares and Castells 2020], [Krichene and Rendle 2020]) and should be generally avoided unless one really works with huge item catalogs of million-size.\n\nRelated to the metrics, it is mentioned in the text that learning an optimal policy allows balancing the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Better exploration vs exploitation will then result in more diverse recommendations (rather than just focusing on more popular recommendations). However, no evidence for this is provided in the results. Some simple metrics like item catalog coverage (i.e., fraction of the number of unique recommended items to the entire catalog size) would help to provide the necessary ground for the claim.\n\nPlease also add a table with the overall statistics for all datasets. Currently, only the RetailRocket dataset is provided with such information.\n\n### **Other concerns**\nI also have a few minor conceptual issues. As stated in the text, the general formulation of the RL problem involves incorporating direct user feedback in the form of rewards, which, in my opinion, leads to the \"chicken and egg problem\". The quality of recommendations would directly depend on the quality of the environment and reward functions, which serve only as an approximation. If the reward function is bad, how can one hope to suddenly have an accurate recommendation model? But if the environment and the reward function are very accurate, why would you need RL on top of it? Why not just use the environment and rewards directly to generate recommendations? Reading the text feels like RL algorithms have already proved their superiority, but no sufficient evidence is provided due to the lack of fair comparison with strong and finely tuned non-RL baselines.\n\nProbably the most standing out promise of RL, which is also mentioned by the authors, is the promise of maximizing long-term user satisfaction. This is a frequent and plausible claim, although actual evidence of that is still an open question. It's not even clear how to measure the long-term effects in offline data. The statement on the long-term effects creates a false impression that the problem is already solved and that there's a scientific consensus on superiority of RL in that regard. \n\nThe authors report monitoring the of training progression as an individual contribution of the work.  No doubt this monitoring is useful in diagnosing and comparing models, but it cannot be a contribution, it's not something new or unused in practice.\n\nPlease also note that the term \"stability\" has another meaning in the realm of recommender systems related to the rate of change of recommendations when the model is updated with new information [Olaleke et al. 2021]. This \"recommendations instability\" is very different from the \"training instability\". A clear distinction between the two somewhere in the introduction would help the reader to avoid confusion. \n\nThere are several issues with constantly changing notation, some letters' font interchangeably becomes straight or italic/caligraphic back and forth. Please fix the notation and use it consistently across the text. \n\nThe first appearance of the Q-value term in the text is not explained, leaving an unprepared reader with the necessity to lookup the literature before proceeding. Adding a few words explaining what Q-value is would improve text readability.\n\nIn page 4, paragraph before section 3.2, there seems to be a confusion between \"off policy\" and \"offline\" training.\n\n### **References**\nKlenitskiy, A. and Vasilev, A., 2023, September.

To demonstrate the empirical impact of their contributions the authors use 5 datasets from the literature and baseline with four recently published algorithms in the literature. The result of their experiments show that their modifications give performance improvements across the board."

Another example is the paper title which makes no mention of sequential recommendations even though this is the primary reason for the paper.\n* The explanation that the SNQN and SA2C perform poorly due to divergence is not clear to me. For example, how was learning rate handled in these methods. Could the drop in performance not be explained by a learning rate that was not decayed quickly enough?\n*  There does not appear to be a clear argument for the necessity of progressive validation despite this being listed as one of the main contributions in the introduction."
