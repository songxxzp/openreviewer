                "value": "1. The description of the neural node in Section 3.2 is convoluted and hard to follow. The underlying logic of the proposed neural node remains unclear. The motivation behind introducing such a neural node is ambiguous. The rationale for segregating the states into two groups at each time step is not motivated. The necessity of introducing $\\hat{V^t}$ (Eqs. 3 and 6) is not clearly justified. Moreover, is $[Y_1,Y_2]$ identical to $[X_1,X_2]$ of the next layer? Is $[\\hat{V_1^t},\\hat{V_2^t}]$ identical to $[V_1^{t+1},V_2^{t+1}]$? To enhance clarity, I recommend that the authors initially expound upon the LIF model, introduce the components of the model that prompt dissatisfaction, and subsequently describe their modifications based on the LIF model.\n\n2. Based on my understanding, $[Y_1, Y_2]$ represents the transmitted signal to other SNN nodes. The issue at hand is that these signals are not binary spikes according to eqs. 2 and 5. However, one of the appealing aspects of SNNs is their utilization of binary events for information processing. In essence, a spiking neuron is active only when it encounters spikes, enabling an event-driven regime and an energy-efficient system. However, the proposed neuron nodes deviate from this advantageous feature by transmitting real-valued signals: neurons are active all the time, and the communication cost is high. \n\n3. Why the neural node can achieve layer reversibility during training? Considering the feedforward connection from the l-th layer to the (l+1)-th layer, $x^{l+1}[t] = W * y^l[t]$, where W is not invertible. I am curious about the approach taken to recalculate $y^l[t]$ from $x^{l+1}[t]$. After all, VGG is used as the network architecture, where the weight matrice are not invertible.\n\n4. While the issue of high training costs is particularly pronounced for large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, this work exclusively tests the proposed method on small-scale datasets (including Tiny-ImageNet). Consequently, the results may not be as convincing, primarily because the training cost for small-scale tasks is relatively affordable. It would be beneficial to extend the evaluation to more computationally demanding datasets to underscore the true efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method."
