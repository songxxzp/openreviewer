Towards this end, the authors propose to combine three basic functions: a new beta function the authors learned to explore under-explored actions, the usual Q function for exploring overestimated actions, and finally a Q_mask function designed for exploitation. A diverse set of policies is constructed from them to encourage space coverage or bias correction, and the specific policy used per episode is selected by a meta-controller in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit fashion. Experiments are performed on a few environments and various components of the proposed method are analyzed, which validates the soundness of the proposed exploration scheme."

After a good coverage of the whole state space, the exploration policies for bias correction (\u03c0cor) are chosen more frequently in this sparse reward environment.\" The pattern however does not hold and becomes more complicated in Section 5.3.1 (Figure 4). Could the authors perform more experiments on a diverse environments to see if any insights can be obtained collectively wrt the environment charactristics? \n2. In Section 5.3.2, \"The policy argmax Q takes greedy actions among the whole action space, it may take overestimated actions thus the performance is not as stable as argmax Qmask.\"  Figure 5 doesn't seem to suggest any clearly difference in terms of stability, though argmax Q_mask does perform better."

High-level idea: the key insight behind exploration is not simply to visit the actions that are infrequently visited, but to add frequency measure (like the count-based methods) to the value, to perform an exploration-exploitation trade-off. The idea of learning a behaviour density estimator is interesting, but integrating this idea with a count-based MAB exploration algorithm makes the algorithm no longer elegant, and hard to identify the performance improvement.\n\n2. The presentation of the paper can be improved. There are many misleading terminology usages. e.g., the *space coverage*, *bias correction*, what does those terms mean in this context?\n\n3. Is the MAB trained concurrently with the Q networks? How does the choice of hyper-parameters affect learning stability (it was partially revealed in Figure 6). In practice, is there a golden standard for selecting those hyper-parameters?\n\n4. It would be helpful to have a standard deviation in results (table 1.)\n\n5. In Equation (1), it\u2019s not clear what \\beta exactly is and how it is parameterised and optimised. Is it a supervised / behaviour cloning policy?\n\n6.

The proposed algorithm is limited to the discrete action domain while most other exploration algorithms do not have such a limitation, and there is no obvious way to directly apply it to the continuous action domains. \n2. The environments of choice are not standard, and potentially too easy to solve. The scale of both environments is too small, and it is skeptical that the proposed algorithm does not scale to a more standard discrete action domain like Atari. The details of my concern are the following:\n* First, the behavior policy \\beta is changing every environment step, which means that the \"mask\" is changing every step. Given that the experiments are only conducted in environments with a limited diversity of observations, the stability of the algorithm when learning in a more complex environment is concerning.\n3. The baselines are not tuned, and the selection of the baseline does not align with the main motivation of the experiment. I am going to decompose my reasons as the following:\n* The purpose of this paper is to propose a computationally efficient, hyperparameter-insensitive, and well-performing exploration algorithm. However, $\\beta$-DQN has two hyperparameters, $L$ and policy set size. Policy set size controls the hardness of the MAB algorithm, whereas the $L$ affects the process of the learning of MAB. The authors provide an ablation study on the analysis of the sensitivity of the size of the policy set but do not provide the ablation study on $L$, which is not enough to convince the reader that $\\beta$-DQN is not sensitive to hyperparameters.\n* As the authors mentioned in the paper, most exploration algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameters. For intrinsic-reward based ones, they are particularly sensitive to the bonus scale factor $\\alpha$. Specifically, the implementation of RND is from the LESSON paper by Kim et al., but the authors use a different $\\alpha$ in this paper and achieved better performance compared to the RND in LESSON paper, which further shows that the the hyperparameter selection can be crucial for the performance of exploration algorithm like RND. Without the systematic tuning of hyperparameters for the baselines, it is hard to convince the readers that $\\beta$-DQN is preferred. Additionally, the ablation study of the size of the policy set does not show an insensitivity of $\\beta$-DQN to this hyperparameter.\nOverall, the experiment setup, including the choice of environments, the hyperparameter selections for baselines, and the ablation study on hyperparameters of $\\beta$-DQN, does not provide enough information for the reader to decide whether or not $\\beta$-DQN is more hyperparameter insensitive, or performs better than other exploration methods."

Tune the hyperparameters of RND, Bootstrapped DQN in a systematic manner, and show that even the best hyperparameter would not yield better performance compared to $\\beta$-DQN, i.e. showing that $\\beta$-DQN is indeed favorable compared to them.\n2. Compare $\\beta$-DQN against the public implementation of RND-PPO and Bootstrapped DQN with the original selection of hyperparameters on the Atari domain, on two sets of environments one contains environments with sparse reward and requiring heavy exploration, the other contains environments with dense reward where even $\\epsilon$-greedy can perform well. \n3.

                "value": "This paper proposed a new method to perform diverse exploration in the reinforcement learning setting. A behavior function beta is learned on in-sample data to model the coverage of different state action pairs. Then standard DQN learning learns a state-action value function Q. Based on the behavior function and the state-action value function Q, the authors proposed to construct a new Q_mask function that corresponds to a pure exploitation policy due to that less explored actions are suppressed by altering its Q value. Next the paper constructs two basic policies pi_cov and pi_cor that aim at better coverage and bias correction respectively. From there, a set of diverse policies are created. These diverse policies have different levels of exploration and exploitation that intuitively help with the learning process. A meta controller is designed based on non-stationary multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms to select a policy from the diverse set, which is then used to interact with the underlying environment to collect new data. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodoloy."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "(1) The paper does not have enough technical contribution. The way to construct diverse policies is elementary. It only concerns learning some function beta that models the data coverage and then doing some policy combination. The way to construct meta controller borrows the MAB framework and does not contain enough novel investigations.\n\n(2) The paper has no theoretical results. The proposed method is not built based on foundational theory but instead some intuitions. This makes the methodology not very trustworthy.\n\n(3) The experiments are performed only on synthetic data and very simple environments. It remains not clear how well the method generalizes to more complicated scenarios such as continuous environment."
