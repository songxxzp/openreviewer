                "value": "This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the performance of compressed Language Model Models (LLMs). The proposed method, referred to as Inference-time Dynamic Prompting (IDP), involves adding a set of trainable soft prompts to the user input. During inference, only the prompt with the highest attention score is activated, making it dynamically selected. The authors have empirically validated the efficacy of their approach across nine downstream tasks, demonstrating that IDP effectively restores the performance of two LLMs (LLaMA and OPT) subjected to two compression techniques (quantization and sparsification). The results show that IDP outperforms the baseline models in terms of overall performance."

Across nine distinct downstream tasks, IDP consistently outperforms these baseline models, which include single prompt, prompt tuning, and LoRA."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Writings\n\nThe paper's clarity and organization require improvement. In particular, the flow of the paper can be challenging to follow, particularly in the experiment section. Section 3.3.1 is titled \"IDP results,\" while 3.3.2 is titled \"More Comparisons and Ablation Studies,\" but it is not clear what differentiates these experiments. Additionally, the discussion of Table 1 and Table 2 occurs after the discussion of Table 3, which can be confusing for readers. The suffixes /short and /large in Table 1 and Table 2 are not adequately explained in the main paper. Furthermore, the details of Table 3 and Table 4, specifically the 3 settings of parameter sizes for LoRA, prompt, and ptune, are not provided in either the captions or the main paper.\n\nThere are some critical details missing in the paper, particularly concerning hyperparameters. For example, the paper does not specify the prompt length and number, which are denoted as n and m in Section 3.2. Furthermore, there is a lack of information regarding the settings for LoRA, ptuning, and soft prompts. Moreover, it would be helpful if the authors presented the results of the original LLMs to demonstrate the performance drop resulting from compression algorithms.\n\n2. Novelty\n\nThe general idea of IDP is based on soft prompting with a dynamic module to select one prompt from a collection of prompts during inference. This solution is akin to the ensemble solution, with the ensembling replaced with a hard selection. Prompt ensembling has been studied by many papers in recent years, and solely applying it to repair compression algorithms isn't novel enough.\n\n3. Performance\n\nThe performance enhancement achieved by IDP, in comparison to the baseline models, tends to be relatively modest. Across Table 1 to Table 4, the observed improvement in performance typically falls within the range of 1%. In cases where the performance gap is quite narrow, it may be helpful to conduct a significance test to assess the statistical significance of the results.\n\n4. Hypothesis test\n\nOne of the claimed contributions of this paper pertains to the exploration of the reasons behind the performance enhancement achieved by IDP. It introduces hypotheses, denoted as H0 and H1, and conducts hypothesis testing. It's worth noting, however, that this process doesn't adhere to the conventional standard of hypothesis testing, which typically involves the rejection of the null hypothesis (H0). Instead, the authors undertake an analysis of the behavior of IDP and the baseline models, drawing the conclusion that H1 is the more plausible explanation.\n\nThe distinction between \"data attrition\" and \"knowledge rechanneling\" is somewhat subtle and challenging to precisely define. The evidence presented in the paper, including the shift in attention patterns, may not be compelling enough to definitively support H1, as factors such as the incorporation of new data sources could also lead to changes in attention patterns, making them difficult to reject."

In all experiments, is the performance of the original models comparable? By showing the performance of un-compressed models, we can clearly see how much compression impairs the model performance."
