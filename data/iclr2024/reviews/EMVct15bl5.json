The poor writing often leads to sentences that come off as grandiose (whether intended or not), such as: _\"What sets this study apart from previous research is the solid theoretical framework bridging deep learning and dynamical systems.\"_\n- The related work is incomplete---it is limited to only closely related papers. For example, there's a lot of work connecting the training of deep nets to potential (algorithmic) stability/robustness properties, e.g. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01240.pdf, http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/du19c/du19c.pdf.\n- The Experiments section is weak. The impact of experiments based MNIST and CIFAR-10 needs to be higher every year to justify using such overused datasets, and I don't think the authors demonstrated that impact here.\n- The figures in the Applications section (specifically 2 and 3) are poorly constructed and hard to parse, undermining what should be the proof of the ideas laid out in the theory section. These figures do not do a good job of establishing why any of the preceding mathematical formalism is needed and/or what value it brings.\n- No code was provided."

For example, take your proposed new concept of \"$g$-expansivity\": if there is an $\\epsilon$ such that\n$$\ng(x) \\neq g(x') \\implies d(g(\\varphi^n(x)), g(\\varphi^n(x')))\\geq \\epsilon \\text{ for some } n\\.\n$$\nI'm a bit skeptical that the above definition is new to dynamical systems."

However, very little of this literature is mentioned. The authors should be clearer when differentiating with previous work. A random selection of google scholar entries: \"Forward Stability of ResNet and Its Variants\",\"Understanding ResNet from a Discrete Dynamical System Perspective\", \"Towards Robust ResNet: A Small Step but a Giant Leap\"\n\n2) Distance $d$ has been used in Definition 1 as a distance between vectors and the same distance $d$ has been used in Definition 3 as a distance between functions. What distances do authors use?\n\n3) ``In this context, we attempted to explore compositions of functions within the domain of H, gaining some\ninsights into their behavior at each processing block, even if it diverges from the conventional ResNet\nstructure.'' -- in what way is this diverging from the ResNet structure?\n\n4) For $g$-expansive constant in Defn 1, the definition says that there exists $n\\geq 0$ such that $d(g(\\phi^n(x)), g(\\phi^n(x'))) \\geq \\varepsilon$. How do authors find this $n$ to calculate $\\varepsilon$ in Table 2?\n\n5) Not sure I understand the definition $Sh_g(\\phi,\\epsilon)=\\sup (\\delta : \\delta \\in Sh_g(\\phi,\\epsilon))$. Same with $Top_g$.\n\n6) In definition 3, Identity map $Id_X:X\\rightarrow X$, but $H:X\\rightarrow 2^X$. How do authors compute distance $d(H, Id_X)?$\n\n7) What are the required properties of $X$ in Definitions 1 and 3? Metric space? Banach space?\n\n8) Statement of Theorem 1. Theorem statements should not include a \"we\".  Also, what is $Y$ in ``g is bounded to bounded''? Also, what does it mean for a hypothesis space to have a Lipschitz constant?\n\n9) I think that $g$-constants and Lipschitz constants do not depend on the dataset, since it is a property of function $g$ and $\\phi$. Why do authors separate these constants for different datasets in Table 2?\n\n10) There are no labels in Figure 2 and 3. If $y$-label can be assumed to be a $g$-expansive constant, there is no information about $x$-labels. Also  description and discussion about these figures (and some tables) are missing in the paper. This made it difficult to  interpret Section 4. \n \n11) The authors make constant use of the first person plural in a way which does not encompass the reader. This makes it seem as if the paper were about the authors and not about the result -- e.g. \"we tried to look at the dynamics of ResNets,\" ``In the manuscript, we assumed''\n \n12) The font of labels, legends and titles of all figures should be increased. \n\nAlso, there are some typos and minor mistakes. \n1) Not sure why ``Dynamical Systems'' is capitalized everywhere\n2) Page 3. I don't think that \"Note that if $\\delta \\in Sh_g(\\phi, \\varepsilon)$ and $\\delta < \\delta'$, then $\\delta' \\in Sh_g(\\phi, \\varepsilon)$.\" is quite right. It should be $\\delta'\\leq \\delta$.     \n3) Page 6. typo \"Figure 3and Table 3\" $->$ \"s in Figure 3 and Table 3\"     \n4) Page 9. Typo \"initia l condition\" $->$ initial condition\n5) ``a directly research linked between''    \n6) Formatting errors in bibliography"
