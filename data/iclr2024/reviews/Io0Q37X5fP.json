What is the point of setting epsilon as a realization with large variance? Usually, $I$ can be very large. Indeed, if there are a large number of individuals, say $I=10000$, a realization can be very large. Further, why do you model epsilon as normally distributed?\n\n2. I have a question about the training process. The objective function is given in Eqn. (2) which is approximated by Eqn. (5). Nevertheless, the computation is given for each t only, where t lies in between 1, \u2026 , T according to the paper. We can obtain T approximations according to Eqn. (5). During training, the goal is to minimize one objective value, but we can calculate T approximations where each of the T approximations can be thought of as the objective value. What should be the objective value of training?\n\n3. In the paper, the authors state that t=1, \u2026, T in the section of PROBLEM SETUP. However, when the authors present Algorithm 1, t = d, \u2026, T. It is strange that t=d, \u2026, T in Algorithm 1. Is it a typo mistake? If not, from my realization about Algorithm 1, d should be determined. How to determine the value of d?"

Wouldn\u2019t the RHS of (4) be the same for all $\\bar{a}$ while the LHS is supposed to be different? And why is the index in (5) from $t-d$ instead of from $t-d+1$? In proof of proposition 1, where does the expectation over $\\bar{a}$ come from? I would be concerned if the authors actually used this formula in their experiments.\n\n- I don\u2019t seem to understand the comment in Remark 1 that doubly robust methods are less robust to model misspecification than IPW methods, and I cannot find relevant discussions in Appendix D as claimed. I'm curious about why the authors would think so.\n\n- One pivotal assumption is that d, the length of history dependence, is finite and known, in which case the IPW methods in a temporal experiment are only a trivial extension to IPW methods in a static experiment. Also, as d gets large, the variance of those IPW-style methods can easily blow up.\n\n- The only theoretical guarantee provided in the paper is that the weighted log likelihood is unbiased. In that sense, this is closer to treatment effect estimations where the estimand of interest is a single value, and it is very different from density estimations. Kennedy et al. (2023) (and some of the other papers mentioned by the authors) require stronger conditions simply because their goals are a lot harder. Since this paper is purely applied, I don\u2019t see how they are comparable.  \n\n- Related to the last point, I fail to see how the absence of a unified theory for doubly robust density approximation in longitudinal settings serves as a reason for not using DR estimators, given that the authors never estimated the density. When the goal is not density estimation, there have been a plethora of studies on variations of IPW and AIPW estimators in longitudinal settings, especially from the dynamic treatment regimes and reinforcement learning literature.\n\n- I find the notations occasionally confusing, and the authors are somewhat vague regarding the assumptions."
