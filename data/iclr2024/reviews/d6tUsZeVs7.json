The approach is theoretically underpinned by generalization bounds and validated through practical applications in 2D and image domains."

Specifically, the paper uses the weak dual form to reformulate the EOT problem into an optimization task over space of functions, where the objective takes form similar to the EBM, i.e. in exponential form. The paper then proceeds to parametrize the function space by neural networks, and applies the algorithm to various tasks. Theoretical results are provided regarding why the proposed method approximates the optimal EOT coupling, and how the estimation and approximation contributes to generalization. Experiments are implemented, where various technical subtleties are also addressed."

Some strengths:\n1. The paper points out that the semi dual form of EOT works well for approximation of optimal coupling. The reviewer finds it interesting, as in semi dual form, essentially only one of the two equations of the Schr\u00f6dinger system is satisfied, thus the other marginal usually lacks control. However, as shown in the theorem 2, even if only one potential is parametrized, constructing a joint distribution by taking conditionals to be normalized exponential models gives clean approximation of the optimal coupling, with bounds on approximation gap. As the construction naturally extrapolates, the proposed method not only computes EOT, but also helps generative sampling.\n2. The proposed usage of EBM seems principled, as EOT semi dual form admits exponential form, which enables application of well-studied sampling methods, and the corresponding gradients all have simple feasible forms.\n3. The experiments seem plenty and sufficient, and various training techniques for EBM are also discussed."

                "value": "Some weaknesses:\n1. One major concern is the bound in Theorem 4, where a classical bound of error illustrating the balance between approximation and estimation is provided, using Rademacher complexity and optimality gap. However, it is unclear what is expected as the overall rate from this bound, as the choice of parametric class remains heuristic. This can be important, as generative tasks usually operates in high dimensions, and the dependence in dimensionality seems crucial to justify the applicability. There are plenty of works, for example, please see [1,2] for approximation and estimation using neural networks. Clarifying the proper choice of the parametric class and giving an explicit balancing characterization would give a clearer picture.\n2. The paper seems to focus more on applicability of EBM, though this class of methods usually requires sampling, which creates major computational burden and additional estimating error. A full computational and space-time complexity analysis seems needed, as even regardless of the NN optimization, the construction of the loss function requires significant computation to obtain an oracle. Furthermore, it would be interesting to also see how sampling error enters the bound in Theorem 4.\n\n[1] Klusowski, Jason M., and Andrew R.
