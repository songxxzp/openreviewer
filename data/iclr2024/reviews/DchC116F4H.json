In blind source separation problems, we are given several measurements (the so-called channels) corresponding to noisy observations of the mixing of different sources. The goal is to recover the sources (and the mixing components of the different sources for each channel). One main limitation of NMF models is that the sources are considered to be the same across the different channels: an assumption that is not always satisfied in practice.\n\nIn this work, the authors propose an extension of the standard NMF model where the different source signals are sampled from some probability distribution in the feature domain for each channel. Contrary to previous works, the distribution of each source is not pre-learned assuming that observations of the sources are available but they are inferred from the channel data."

The negative binomial distribution would be particularly valuable for the biological application suggested by the authors as it enables the modeling of overdispersion, a phenomenon known to occur in such biological settings.\n\n- In the same spirit, would it be possible to change the model to have dependence between features of source $k$ ?\n\n\nHere are some typos (or minor comments):\n\n- It might be beneficial to also include a reference to Section A.7 of the Appendix in the section discussing experiments on real data, which explains how you tested your model on fresh data. Indeed, I was briefly confused because NMFs are known to encounter the cold start problem, and I was curious about the authors' approach to testing the model on new data.\n\n- At Eq.(11), a closing parenthesis should be removed. Same at Eq.(35).\n\n- At page 11, \"Differentiating\" should be \"differentiating\".\n\n- In Lemma 5, it might be good to specify which parametrization of the negative binomial distribution you consider.\n\n- I think the logarithm should be removed in Eq.(21).\n\n- In Eq.(30), the symbol \"sum\" does not display properly.\n\n- After Eq.(37), the same style is not used for the log-likelihood function ($l$ instead of $\\ell$).\n\n- At Eq.(40) (second line), I think you should remove one \"$p(.)$\"."
