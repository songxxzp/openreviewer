Encouraging neuron death during training may compromise the expressivity of neural networks, potentially leading to performance degradation. The authors, however, propose accelerating neuron death and subsequent pruning. What is the motivation to accelerate the neuron death? (I understand the authors' motivation, i.e., pruning, but why just have a \"normal\" speed of pruning as the neurons will die at the end of training with a high probability.) Besides, It's worth noting that several existing works already prune networks by removing small-weight \"dead\" neurons without the need for prompting [1, 2] in structured pruning and unstructured pruning, e.g., magnitude. \n2. the paper lacks direct evidence that dead neurons **remain inactive** during training, despite the existence of previous works validating this hypothesis, such as the overlap coefficient [3]. \n3. The experiments in Fig 2 suggest that noise may contribute to the accumulation of dead neurons, but its role appears to be more like an amplifier than a key driver. Moreover, the effect seems to depend on the noise type. The section seems more focused on expanding the word count which makes this paper inconsistent, and the experimental details on noisy updating are insufficient. Additionally, \n\nMinor:\n1.

                "value": "Score-affecting:\n\n1. More results on speedups from DemP would be great to see. For instance, using your method, can you improve on the Mosaic ML ResNet50 ImageNet training time result? (See https://docs.mosaicml.com/projects/composer/en/stable/tutorials/train_resnet50_on_aws.html.) \n2. ResNet18 typically gets ~95% accuracy on CIFAR10 but does not in your experiments. Could you please explain the hyperparameter choices causing the gap? \n   - If the decrease in accuracy is caused by the regularization approach you use to encourage sparsity, that is seemingly a limitation of the proposed method that should be stated clearly. \n3. In the main text, please make clear that the baseline methods compared to (e.g., EarlyCroP) are not using the (potentially suboptimal) regularization schedule required by DemP. I believe they are not based on my reading of Sections F.1 and F.3, but please correct me if I am wrong.\n4. Is DemP effective on more modern architectures like ViTs or language models? Exploring transformer models need not require a significant increase in compute (e.g. results on GPT-2 Small would be interesting and that model is not too much larger than ResNet50).\n5. The fact that unstructured pruning baselines aren't well tuned, which is noted in the manuscript, should coincide with more cautious claims about performance relative to unstructured pruning. \n   - A well tuned magnitude pruning algorithm on ResNet-18 using CIFAR10 data actually improves baseline accuracy (95% accurate) at 95% sparsity (96% accurate); see Figure 1 of Diffenderfer et al. (2021).\n   - Consider complementing Figure 6 with more details (in the main text) on the unstructured algorithms to provide needed context for their performances. \n   - Relative to unstructured pruning, the benefit of DemP to emphasize is probably its ability to provide speedups (as opposed to its ability to match weakly-tuned unstructured pruning algorithms on accuracy).\n6. It would be great to see ImageNet accuracy at a few different DemP sparsity levels in a figure that supplements Table 1 (i.e., show the accuracy-efficiency frontier created by DemP). \n7. In Table 1, train your own baselines (at least for the dense model). \n   - Right now, it's unclear what to attribute the gap between Dense and DemP to (training code differences or DemP's effect).\n\n\nImportant:\n1. Figures should be closer to where they are discussed. E.g., Figure 4 is two pages away from where it's explained. \n\nMinor:\n\n1. The second paragraph of Section 3.1 should be made clearer -- where are the 3904 neurons that are referenced coming from?\n2. The Maxwell's demon analogy in the intuition section is slightly unclear, perhaps clean this up a bit to avoid confusion. \n   - If I understand correctly, the demon in that thought experiment is needed because there's otherwise a lack of a mechanism for entropy decreasing. When it comes to a neuron's transition to death/life, however, there are actual mechanisms (e.g., learning rate size) that govern transitions; no hypothetical demon is needed. Perhaps the function of the analogy is to clarify that, before the present manuscript, neuron death transition was treated too much like a black box (or demon). In any case, I suggest revising the \"Intuition\" paragraph that discusses this analogy. \n3. At the top of page 5, a simplified version of Equation 4 is referenced, I think \"3\" is meant.\n4. In equation 5, is eta in the denominator or numerator of the exponent? I think it's the latter but the typesetting leaves this unclear. \n5. The last sentence of the third to last paragraph on page 5 is unclear, I think an \"=0\" is missing. \n6. Figure 7 has an incorrect caption.\n7. On page 8, you reference Table 5, I think you mean Table 1."
