MVP is trained on Ego4D, so there is a massive distribution shift, perhaps explaining the poor performance. For a fairer comparison, could Masked Visual Pre-training be performed on data from the environments directly (e.g. using the trajectories)? \n  - While the visual backbone models are initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights, may be revealing to include this (without any further training) as another baseline.\n- Data is simulated.

With just 150 triplet dataset used for both the tasks to learn preferences the tasks being studied brings up a question about how well this approach works on more complex tasks? For example, the block movement task in x-magical environment only requires agent to avoid the blue box in the environment. This can essentially be treated as a simple obstacle to avoid in the environment which is simple to learn in general. Some example tasks authors could use for evaluation are: block stacking task with constraints where a user prefers stacking blocks based on size i.e. largest block is at lowest followed by smaller blocks irrespective of the color of boxes. This setup tests generalization ability of the policy to different colors and ability to reason about object size based on preferences. My point being preference-based learning needs to be evaluated with tasks that have distractors that are difficult to pick up. It\u2019d be nice if authors can add more experiments on different manipulation tasks with such properties\n2. One baseline I\u2019d like to see in addition to RAPL is how well does a simple contrastive pretrained visual representation as reward with same optimal transport logic performs in comparison to RAPL. It is unclear how beneficial RAPL\u2019s triplet sampling is for the current set of tasks being considered. \n3. For the cross-embodiment experiments the simple tasks of block movement doesn\u2019t necessarily highlight how well the proposed approach is performing. I\u2019d be interested in seeing similar results in simple object pick and place task similar to one asked in W1.\n4. Human preferences are multi-modal in nature i.e. different people have different preferences. The current setup doesn\u2019t consider multi-modal preferences and show experiments comparing different methods in such a setup which seems like a big flaw in current experimental setup. I\u2019d like authors to consider adding experiments that\u2019d demonstrate effectiveness of RAPL under such setting"
