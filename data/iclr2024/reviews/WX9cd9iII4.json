                "value": "This paper studies how to enforce user-side fairness in (off-)policy learning. Specifically, the paper considers allocating (i) the same action choice probability regardless user's sensitive attributes (e.g., allocating the decisions of credit lending $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ regardless of their gender) and (ii) the same benefits (i.e., conditional policy value) for different user demographic groups. For this, the paper proposes the combination of the following two methods. The first one is fair representation learning, which aims to learn a feature $\\Phi(X)$ which is predictive for the outcome ($Y$), but is not predictive for the sensitive feature ($S$). The second is to impose three types of fairness constraints to the policy learning objectives. The results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed method performs better than a naive baseline that myopically optimizes for the policy value without the fairness constraints."

As the definition of action fairness should affect the theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations in the rest of the paper, this seems to be a critical concern.  Please refer to Question 1 for details.\n\n2. **Related work seems insufficient.** \nSpecifically, while the paper proposes a fair representation learning method, no discussion of fair representation learning is provided in the related work. It was thus difficult to judge if the proposed approach is novel enough from the manuscript due to the lack of this discussion.\n\n3. **No discussion on how the specific problem of off-policy learning has been resolved.** In my understanding, enforcing fairness in OPL is difficult because $V_s$  $(= \\mathbb{E}_{A \\sim \\pi(X)}[Y | X, A, S=s])$, which is necessary for imposing the constraints on \"value fairness\", is not easily estimated with biased logged data. However, there is no explicit discussion on this point, and it seems that the paper just applied what has been successful in the online setting to the off-policy setting, without discussing particular challenges we will face in OPL. It is not clear what kind of OPL-related problems this paper tries to solve, and also there is no discussion about this point in the related work. It would also be beneficial to have additional ablations for this part in the experiments as well.\n\n4. **Results of the real-world experiments do not seem promising.** The proposed approach improves \"action fairness\", however, it does not improve or even sometimes worsens the \"value fairness\" compared to the naive, unconstrained policy. Justifications are needed for this point.\n\n5. **The clarity of writing has some room for improvement.** Aside from the above points, this paper has some additional ambiguous parts. Please refer to Questions 2 and 3."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. **Definition of action fairness**\n\nFirst, the paper defines the action fairness as follows.\n\n> a policy $\\pi$ should assign the same action $A=A'$ to two individuals with the same covariates $X = X'$ but different gender $S=S'$.\n\nHowever, the paper repeatedly mentions that covariates $X$ can also be a factor of unfairness even if the algorithm does not explicitly make decisions on the sensitive attributes $S$ as follows.\n\n> in observational data, **other variables may act as proxies of for gender, and, hence, the learned policy may still lead to discrimination** due to the underlying data-generation process. (Introduction)\n\n> Action fairness is .. It ensures that individuals who only differ with respect to their sensitive attributes (**and covariates correlated with them**) receive the same decision. (Section 4)\n\nGiven this kind of confoundings, I guess the action fairness should instead be defined as follows.\n\n*Let $\\bar{X} \\subseteq X$ be a covariate that does not depend on the sensitive attribute $S$ (i.e., $\\bar{X} \\perp S$). Then, a policy $\\pi$ should assign the same action $A=A'$ to two individuals with the same covariates $X \\setminus \\bar{X} = X' \\setminus \\bar{X'}$ but different gender $S \\neq S'$ and the associated attributes $\\bar{X} \\neq \\bar{X'}$*. \n\nThis modification will be needed because we can consider the following situation: $X_0 = f(S_0)$ and $X_{1:m}$ is drawn independent of $S_0$. In this case, the original condition can still cause discrimination because the policy can still allocate different actions depending on $X_0$ even if the policy does not explicitly depend on $S$ (i.e., \"$\\pi(X) \\perp S$\" as described in the paper).\n\nCould you provide any justification for this point?\n\n2. **\"*Parato-optimal*\" and \"*general*\" policies in related work**\n\nThe paper cites Viviano & Bradic, 23 as one of the most important related works and discusses the differences. However, it was not clear for me what are \"*Parato-optimal*\" and \"*general*\" policies refer to. Clarifications are needed for this point.\n\n3. **Experimental details**\n\nIn the synthetic experiment section, I found this description:\n\n> We provide the results for our framework across three different policy scores, namely $m \\in $ {DM, IPS, DR}. \n\nHowever, Table 1 reports the results of only one of them, and the section does not describe which method is used. Additionally, I could not find any additional results even in the Appendix. Could you provide some clarification on this? I also suggest reporting the number of random seeds used for the experiment.\n\n**Some other suggestions for improvement (not really weaknesses)**\n- On page 4, the paper denotes \"$\\mu_j(X, S) = \\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j], j = \\{ 0, 1 \\}$, are the outcome regression functions\" (of DM and DR). However, $\\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j]$ by definition refers to the (conditional) expected reward rather than the outcome of regression. $\\mu_j(X, S) \\approx \\mathbb{E}[Y | X, S, A = j]$ should be more appropriate (i.e., using \"$\\approx$\" instead of \"$=$\").\n\n- Reading the Introduction, it was unclear whether the paper was focusing on user- or action-side fairness. Since there are some discussions on item fairness in recommender systems (e.g., Singh & Joachims, 18), it might be helpful to explicitly mention either sensitive features belonging to users' covariate or actions' features. (In Section 2, I soon realized that the paper focuses on user-side fairness, though)\n\nSingh & Joachims, 18: Ashudeep Singh, Thorsten Joachims. \"Fairness of Exposure in Rankings\". KDD, 2018."

For the first step, the idea of leveraging adversarial objectives to achieve independence between sensitive attribute and representation is similar to the concept of GAN, a common approach for fair representation learning. For the second step, the learning objective with fairness constraint is also straightforward. \n\n2. The paper doesn\u2019t compare with any algorithms in experiments.

I would be great if the authors can discuss how these quantities are obtained, and how they affect the theoretical and empirical results. \n\n2. For empirical evaluation, especially for real-world data one, we do not know the counterfactual outcome of counterfactual actions. It would be great if the authors can discuss how the performance metrics are calculated. \n\n3. The contribution seems limited. The fairness notions proposed in this paper appear in many prior works. The approach to achieving \"action fairness\" seems to be borrowed from prior works. The approach to achieving \"value\" fairness is a direct application of counterfactual estimator. \n\n4. It would be great if the authors could discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these fairness objectives. In particular, when are these fairness objectives applicable? For example, envy-free does not seem to make sense to me in many applications, since it might happen that it is very easy to achieve larger expected outcome for one group than the other. Maybe the maximum value we can achieve for group A is 1, and the minimum value we can achieve for group B is 1 and the maximum for B is 2. Suppose there is a policy that can achieve value 1 for A and 2 for B, why would we decrease the value for B just to satisfy this fairness notation? For max-min fairness, similar arguments apply. Since group A is always lower in policy value, we will only learn our policy for group A. Why is this advantageous compared to fairness definitions that achieve pareto optimality? \n\nSome minor points:\n4. In assumption 1, it should be P(A=1 | X=x, S=s), right? Otherwise, equation (3) and (4) might be ill-defined since \\pi_b(X,S) can be zero. \n\n5. Equation (2), (3), (4), \\phi is a function of D, which contains i.i.d. random variables of several datapoints. But in the right hand side, there is only one datapoint. It is a bit confusing to me. \n\n6. Theorem 1 is hard to understand. I think it must depend on the logging/behavior policy. Maybe it is captured in K? It would be great if the authors can have a clear definition of these notations. And it does not seem to take into account the fact that we are in the observational setting as I mentioned in 1."
