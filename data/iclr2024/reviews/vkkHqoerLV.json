Although using the name of object re-identification, it only focuses on persons and vehicles. The main contribution of the paper is the proposed Alice benchmarks, which include both synthetic and real-world data. Specifically, an application is training a model with fully-labeled synthetic data and then tuning it on the unlabeled real-world data. A significance of the paper is its real-world data do not have pre-define \u201ccluster\u201d architecture, which is more practical. The authors try to regard it as a successor \n of the famous Market benchmark."

Some other contributions as benchmarking existing works and discussion. They cannot be considered as significance due to (1) no significance contribution beyond other works. (2) no novel method is proposed to customize the new-labeled synthetic to real dataset.\n2. The domain adaptation seems not suitable for synthetic to real datasets. The gain of synthetic data is easy and straightforward. Therefore, we should generate more diversed synthetic data to achieve domain generalization rather than domain adaptation. Please refer to ClonePerson and RandPerson for this kind of research;\n3. The authors discuss the legitimate in data-labeling, however, the main step that incurs the privacy problem is capturing data. How can your data captured in Figure 2 protects the privacy of persons and vehicles. As far as I concern, the passerbys cannot know their cars or themselves are trained for AI models. A license from local government is not enough, it seems to be the human right matters;\n4. The authors try to provide some understanding, however, these understandings are not well-defined by mathematics. Instead, they are some intuitive ones without proof. Some understanding in theory is expected."

However, for AlicePerson, I do NOT think adding distractor and junk is a good way to solve the strong clusterability issue compared. For AliceVehicle, in Table.4, I do NOT find much difference between AliceVehicle and VeRi776 on the strong clusterability issue.\n2.
