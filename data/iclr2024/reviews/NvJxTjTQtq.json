The authors may consider adding some more models to further validate the limitations of previous datasets and metrics. \n2. What are the hyperparameter settings for the equivariant models in the experiments?\n3. In Table 1, there are models that perform well on one dataset but fail on the other. For example, allegro performs well on MD17 but is really bad on GeTe. What are the differences in the molecular systems that lead to the divergence? Are there possible under-fit?\n4. In section 4.4.1, ML models are trained on a subset of 3 moelcules in MD17 and evaluated on another molecule. Not surprisingly, none of the models perform well in this setting as the types and number of molecular data are limited. However, this may not reflect the real application. [2] unveils that allegro pre-trained on SPICE, a large dataset with molecules < 100 atoms, can conduct molecular simulations of large molecular systems with 1M atoms. So a more realistic setting for OOD generalization may be training on large datasets with a wide variety of small molecules and test how it performs on other molecular systems. \n5. For the dynamics metrics, if two molecular systems start from the same initial structure but different initial velocities, they can diverge later. When that happens, EV & FV may fail to provide meaningful evaluations. Are there controls over the initial configuration when comparing ML-based simulations with ground truth?\n6. How does EGraFFBench handle periodic boundary condition (PBC)?\n7. In table 2, some models are not properly highlighted though superior performance is achieved. \n\n\n[1] Fu, X., Wu, Z., Wang, W., Xie, T., Keten, S., Gomez-Bombarelli, R. and Jaakkola, T., 2022.
