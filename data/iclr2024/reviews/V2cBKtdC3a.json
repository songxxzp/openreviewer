                "value": "- One concern I have is that the authors do not convincingly demonstrate the benefit of their model compared to the status quo, which is a fully connected RNN + truncated BPTT. In terms of complexity, the authors do reduce the memory/computational cost on pointwise RNNs to order N^2 which is certainly better than RTRL on standard RNNs, but this is still as expensive as BPTT on a fully connected RNN. In fact, for a pointwise RNN I wonder if BPTT is in fact of order N (as the forward pass?) - so still cheaper than RTRL - but I may be incorrect there. In terms of performance, the authors show that eLSTM + RTRL outperforms truncated BPTT on all RNN arhitectures for one task (watermaze) which is impressive, but I would have liked to seen this for more tasks; e.g. can RTRL outperform fully connected RNN + BPTT on any of the 5 Atari tasks in Fig 2?\n- Related to the above, it is not clear whether online learning has any intrinsic benefits for performance. The authors note that online learning \"allows for updating weights immediately after consuming very new input\", but in practice the weights are only updated at the same rate as truncated BPTT (at rate M) to avoid 'sensitivity matrix staling'. I appreciate this is a difficult question to answer, and I believe this shortcoming is mentioned as the last presented limitation, but I think this deserves more direct clarification/exploration given the subject of this work.  \n- All main results presented are with respect to performance in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, but what about supervised learning tasks? e.g. sequence modeling in language. The authors do use the 'copy task', which is a supervised learning task, as a diagnostic task, but I would have liked to see comparisons with BPTT for hard supervised learning tasks. Or at least a rational for only considering RL tasks\n- The connection to biology and the 'memory' trace (e.g. Eqs 12-14) is interesting but not presently quite vague/weak. Some references to biological evidence for such traces (e.g. eligibility traces) would be advised.\n- Given this is a paper which explores the practical/emperical outcomes of RTRL, I would advise a more thorough analysis of the ideal conditions for RTRL. For example, why do the authors believe RTRL is only valuable in some of the 5 Atari environments in Fig 2? For what types of task would RTRL be ill-advised? The space for technical description and equations in the main text is significant (e.g. equations 8-14) and in general I believe this should be in part sacrificed (to the Appendix) for more intepretability of the results."

                "value": "- The authors suggest that their work shows tractable RTRL in Quasi-RNN (Bradbury et al. 2017) and Simple Recurrent Units (Lei et al. 2018). I understand this for the latter, since as far as I understand the eLSTM is just a one-layer instance, but I don't understand this for Quasi-RNN. Doesn't this architecture use convolutions? Does that also mean that RTRL has a space/time complexity of N^2?\n- The authors state that, \"in practice, it is known that M > 1 is crucial (for TD learning of the critic) for optimal performance\". Is this true? My belief was that one-step TD learning was frequently employed. Is there a relevant citation?\n- How were the hyperparameters (Table 5) selected?\nTypos: \n- Mozer (1989; 1991) already explore an RNN -> Mozer (1989; 1991) already explored/s an RNN\n- several modern RNN architectures such Quasi-RNN -> several modern RNN architectures such as Quasi-RNN"

The context length for TBPTT is relatively short (it seems far smaller than the one modern GPUs would offer) so those experiments do not seem to answer the question:\n    > In what scenarios would RTRL be able to replace BPTT in today\u2019s deep learning?\n    \n    asked by the authors. Adding a baseline that uses as much context length as possible would help better contextualize the findings of the paper. To me, this is the main weakness of the paper, and fixing it may require substantial changes.\n    \n- The paper is missing a few relevant references:\n    - Bellec et al. 2017: RTRL from a computational neuroscience perspective. One of the main contributions of the paper is to discuss how RTRL can be implemented biologically through eligibility traces.\n    - Gupta et al. 2022: show that it is possible to parametrize some classes of linear RNNs (more precisely linear SSMs) diagonally, without losing too much performance. Orvieto et al. 2023, which is cited in this paper, build on this result.\n    - Zucchet et al. 2023: show that spatial backpropagation combined with element-wise complex-valued recurrence enables learning multilayer networks with a performance close to the one of BPTT.\n- The paper mentions the multilayer case as an important limitation but does not discuss any possible or existing solutions (layer-wise training of Javed et al. 2023 / spatial backpropagation of errors of Zucchet et al. 2023)"
