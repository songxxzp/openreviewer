The goal is to learn a latent linear action of the group, similar to how the DFT encodes linear representations of the shift group. Many symmetries (e.g. fisheye transformations) are obvious symmetries to the human eye, but there is no easy way to represent them using classic theory. The learning task is decomposed into three cases, where the network has to match using a linear action in latent space and a nonlinear action in data space. Theoretical results are verified on several tasks."

There are various approaches which then construct linear-equivariant layers followed by a suitable non-linearity and then stack them together. However, often the underlying group or action might not be known. The starting point of the paper is to consider the usual (and then the group) Fourier transform and its well-known equivariance relation. The idea is to construct a non-linear extension where the underlying action is not known, but has similar behaviour as the usual FT. This method dubbed as the non-linear Fourier transform affords finding a relation similar to the usual Fourier transform without having access to analytically tractable knowledge of the group action. It however, does require access to transformed versions of the data to set up a loss function that might be minimized. Various basic properties of this transform and shown. The work heavily relies on ideas from Miyakato et al. and Keller and Welling."
