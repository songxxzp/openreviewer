QA is chosen to make it easier to evaluate the accuracy of model outputs. \nRelevant literature from other ML fields which have made greater progress than LLMs/NLP in quantifying model uncertainty are referenced."

The paper however isn't very clear in how uncertainty and confidence are not the same thing, with multiple sentences referring to \"uncertainty/confidence\" as though they are the same, and section 4.2. not written in a way that helps clarify the working definitions of how these differ either. This is frustrating for the reader. \n\nThe main limitation is only using question answering to test the models here. There are a spectrum of NLG tasks, and I agree with the authors that caring about uncertainty is less likely for completely open generation. However there are tasks like data-to-text (ie knowledge grounded) NLG, where the outputs need to be trusted, and it remains an open issue whether these methods reported here are transferable to tasks other than QA. The QA task is also interesting in that it is extracting answers from the LLMs weights, rather than using the LLM as a general tool for e.g. the data-to-text task, where the info is given as structural inputs."

Or is there other reasons as well?\n* How is the issue of model calibration different?\n* Do you think these results transfer to other tasks such as data-to-text?

In this scenario, where only the generated sequences are observable and the language model (LLM) can be queried repeatedly for confidence and uncertainty assessments, the proposed method leverages pair-wise similarity or entailment probabilities between generated samples to construct a weight graph. Spectral clustering is employed on that graph to compute confidence and uncertainty scores. Intriguingly, the paper's results suggest that this method can outperform traditional white-box techniques in certain instances, highlighting its potential for enhancing NLG performance."

Using this framework, the authors compare different estimation methods using number of semantic sets, sum of eigenvalues, degree matrix, and eccentricity. For the pairwise similarity, they compare the standard Jaccard similarity as well as model-based method using predicted probabilities from a natural language inference (NLI) model. Experiment results show that the proposed uncertainty and confidence score estimation outperform the baselines, and sometimes better than white-box methods."

I think many of these datasets are factual, thus human evaluation might not be as tricky as say creative writing task, so having more human verification on the results would make the claim stronger.
