What is the advantage of the proposed method over the polyhedral approximation in [2]?\n\n3. Since one of the key contributions in this work is to employ neural networks to learn and approximate the value function $\\phi(x)$, I suggest the authors clearly discuss the existing approximation-based methods (i.e., which approximate the lower-level optimization problems and reformulate the bilevel optimization problems as single-level optimization problems, for instance, polyhedral approximation) in bilevel optimization since I can't find any discussion about the approximation-based methods in bilevel optimization.\n\n4. Training the neural networks to approximate the value function $\\phi(x)$ may introduce some variance which will lead to the solution of the resulting single-level problem far away from the original bilevel optimization problems.

I understand that matrix Q is selected to be PSD is for the polynomial-solvability, but what is the main reason of solving the quadratic program in the first place? If we replaced this enhanced sampling with some other more naive sampling methods, how would it affect the experiment results?\n2. Limitation of the experiment setup and analysis: \n   (a) Instance dimension up to 60 is too small.\n   (b) The selection of the lower level problem is LP and MILP, which both have linear lower level objective function. At least you could have tried some simple nonlinear functions like quadratic function.\n   (c) The experimental results do not support the conclusion well. I list some of the points in the next Questions section."

My question is, even though the MiBS solver might take a long time to reach optimality, have you considered to set a time limit, and compare the relative error of the best found solution given by the solver at time limit with your approaches?\n2. In your Conclusion section you mentioned: \"we demonstrated that the enhanced sampling helps reduce average relative error\". However, the whole point of your sampling method is simply to get enough data points for training the neural network. In order to claim that your proposed enhanced sampling can bring some extra benefits, you need to at least compare with other non-trivial sampling methods.\n3. In Conclusion section: \"The computational time of using ...... is significantly shorter than that of MiBS ......\" I admit that this is true, but your methods also do not reach optimality, for fair comparison you either need to have enough samples for exactly learning the value function (so that your approach can also produce a true optimal solution), or you need to compare the best feasible solution found by MiBS within a given time limit. \n\nMinor question:\n1. I suggest to give an exact definition for \"binary tender\". As far as I know, I do not think this is a well-known term in the community.\n2. Still about the definition of \"binary tender\". On Page 2 \"we assume that the entries of x appearing in the lower-level formulation are binary-valued\". However, in Appendix C, about the instance generation for the experiments, I notice that the binary constraint on x is enforced in the upper-level instead of the lower-level formulation."
