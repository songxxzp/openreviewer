            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "## Main Weaknesses\n1. **Insufficient experimental setup for proposed method.** \n    The authors claim that for small-scale datasets their method preserves the performance boost of standard ensembling but results in better calibration, while maintaining the same level of efficiency (as opposed to joint training methods that are compared to). However, this comparison seems incomplete - firstly, my understanding is that the compared-to ensembling approaches do not make use of the additional unlabeled data (at least standard ensembling does not). In Table 1 (the main table in the paper) the results are with respect to a training size of 1000 data points, but the unlabeled data size and validation size are 5000 points each. As a result, this comparison seems unfair - one should at least consider some other pseudo-labeling scheme for the unlabeled data, since it makes up the majority of the data being considered.\n\n    Additionally, even this part aside, the authors should compare the method to training ensembles with some kind of data augmentation (label smoothing [1], Mixup [2], etc.) since these methods are not only known to improve feature learning diversity but also regularize predicted confidences. Furthermore, training with these methods is going to be even more efficient than the proposed approach, and I expect would perform better. My reasons for expecting this are two-fold: firstly, the proposed approach intuitively regularizes confidence by having the ensemble uncertainty be high on the unlabeled data (essentially these points should be predicted uniformly randomly based on how the ensembles are trained), but Mixup and label smoothing are approaches that can do this as well. Additionally, and more importantly, the authors themselves note that their approach does not work (and can even hurt) for larger dataset sizes, but the aforementioned data augmentations are known to improve calibration even in that regime.\n\n2. **Theoretical approach needs greater clarity.** The theory here needs significantly more clarification in my view. For example, the authors define $\\hat{\\rho}$ to be a uniform combination of point masses on different weights (and even here the notation should be made more precise, $\\delta$ is not defined a priori) and then claim that $\\hat{V}$ is the empirical variance of $\\hat{\\rho}$, but that is not what it represents from Equation (2), which is the variance of the predictive distribution of the ensemble when evaluated with respect to the true labels of data points in $U$. Furthermore, for the predictive distribution the authors use $p(y \\mid x, f)$ in Equation (2) and it should be clarified at this point that $y$ corresponds to the true label of $x$ (which the authors mention later). More importantly, the proof of Proposition 1 is very hard to make sense of. What is the indicator variable of $y$ not being in the random labels? Aren't the random labels supposed to be exhaustive? Even ignoring this, how does the second term become zero when passing from the first line to the second line? \n\n## Recommendation\nOverall I do not think the merits of the proposed approach are significant enough to merit acceptance, so my recommendation is **reject**. It is possible I misunderstood some aspects of the theory and I am happy to correct some of my statements here upon author clarification, but I feel even with that the authors would need more comprehensive experimental comparisons to emphasize the usefulness of the approach."

The randomly labelled data promotes ensemble diversity. A PAC bound which relates generalisation performance to ensemble diversity is derived while the diversity of the ensemble is demonstrated to be related to the ensemble size. Experiments on various slices of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 show that while the method does not improve accuracy relative to standard ensembles, there are substantial gains on calibration.

More formally one could imagine that vast amounts of unlabelled data would promote the diversity term in the RHS of equation 1, but I given results in the noisy labels literature, I would find it hard to believe that this would not come at a corresponding cost in the first term on the RHS of equation 1. Could the authors please comment on this concern? Experimentally, I would be interested in seeing an experiment on ImageNet, for example, where the labelled set is of size 50k and the unlabelled set is 950k examples, a standard resnet50 or similar capacity model is used with 4 ensemble members (as per other papers in the literature) and a comparison to standard ensembles in terms of accuracy and calibration is given. This is a significant concern for me, as usually with methods that make use of an unsupervised dataset, the expectation is that as the unlabelled dataset grows, the gains from using it grow to. I fear this will not be the case for this method, which would limit the method to the small dataset, small number of classes and small unlabelled dataset regime. I recognise that the $\\beta$ hyperparameter can to a certain extent control this trade-off, so if further experiments are conducted to address this concern, please report the results over the $\\beta$ hyperparameter range."

                "value": "The paper introduces a method to enhance the calibration of deep ensembles, particularly in situations where there is a small amount of labeled data and some unlabeled data. For each point in the unlabeled dataset, the ensemble members are trained with different randomly selected labels. The authors provide a theoretical justification for this approach, drawing on PAC-Bayes bounds to argue that it leads to lower negative log-likelihood and higher ensemble diversity on test samples. Empirically, they demonstrate that \u03bd-ensembles outperform standard ensembles in terms of diversity and calibration, especially when the training dataset is small or moderate in size."

The use of unlabeled data to improve calibration error of deep ensembles has not been explored much before as most of the works have focused on joint training approaches which can be memory and computationally expensive.\n- The paper is overall well written and easy to understand. \n- The paper presents supports their method with both theoretical and experiments."

                "value": "- One major weakness of the paper is that their method only improves calibration error not accuracy but they have not compared to any other calibration technique like temperature sampling. \n- The other issue is that the method appears very similar to the Agree to disagree work mentioned in the paper where they also use unlabeled data to maximize diversity and the idea seem incremental. Can the authors please explain in detail how exactly Agree to disagree maximizes diversity on the unlabeled set?\n- Another limitation is that this method only improves calibration in the small data regime. \n- Another limitation is that there are only two datasets used in the paper - CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. It would be nice to have additional datasets."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- The paper says that the labels for unlabeled data points are chosen without replacement. What happens if we sample with replacement? One should expect the same empirical results to hold but maybe the theoretical argument will not hold?\n- I understand the text written at bottom of the Figure 1 but I don\u2019t understand the figure. What are the 3 columns in the figure?\n- One part that is not clear to me is when we are forcing the models to make random predictions on unlabeled data which is from the same distribution, why we are not hurting the accuracy or the cross entropy loss of the model? When training data is small and unlabeled data set is bigger, can the authors share their regularization parameters and if they had to give small weights on the regularization term?\n- The colors used in figure 2 and 3 are very similar and it is hard to distinguish different lines. \n- There are other works which also use this idea of diversifying using unlabeled datapoint for other problems. For example, DIVERSIFY AND DISAMBIGUATE: OUT-OF-DISTRIBUTION ROBUSTNESS VIA DISAGREEMENT. Can the authors please compare to this work also?\n- Did the authors try using the unlabeled data from different distributions like random Gaussian noise. One benefit would be that fitting random labels on this dataset will not interfere with the learning on the original distribution."
