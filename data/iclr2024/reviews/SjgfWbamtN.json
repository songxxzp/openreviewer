However, the model has poor complexity characteristics and high peak memory usage, and inference on longer proteins often runs for several minutes or more. The authors propose MiniFold, a barebones, single-sequence architecture built with select modules from AlphaFold2. Despite the model's small parameter count, it achieves a high fraction of ESMFold's single-sequence performance on CAMEO proteins and runs faster."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Since MiniFold only predicts the backbone structure, the comparison to architectures like AlphaFold2 and ESMFold is a little bit unfair. It's unclear from this manuscript whether ablated components are actually unnecessary or necessary to predict the positions of atoms excluded here.\n- There are a lot of important baselines missing here. RGN2 (Chowdhury et al., 2021) is a lightweight structure predictor with a language model that purports to be faster than AlphaFold2 by six orders of magnitude. Optimized versions of the full AlphaFold2 like FastFold (Cheng et al., 2022), UniFold (Li et al., 2022), and recent versions of OpenFold (Ahdritz et al., 2022) also exist but are not tested here. RosettaFold2 is also missing.\n- CAMEO evaluation is not sufficient to tease out the differences between structure prediction models. The gold standard is CASP proteins, which often reveal much larger gaps between models than can be seen in CAMEO figures alone. ESMFold famously underperformed AlphaFold2 at CASP15 by a very wide margin, and I suspect the limited capacity of MiniFold could hold it back even further here.\n- Originality isn't the only criterion here, but I'm not sure if this paper has many new insights that would be of interest to the broader machine learning community. The observation that triangle attention isn't strictly necessary was already noted in the original AlphaFold2 paper. Other more surprising claims (recycling isn't necessary) need to be supported by additional evidence, like a CASP evaluation. As I mentioned above, this isn't the first paper to present an optimized, protein-language-model based lightweight alternative to AlphaFold2 either.\n\nBits and bobs:\n\n> Our analysis reveals that the bulk of the compute is spent in the Evoformer blocks, which is responsible for predicting the pairwise interactions between the protein residues. Specifically, the Triangular attention layers of the Evoformer have O(n3) time and memory complexity, which hinders scaling to longer sequences.\n\n- This is a bit grandiose. The complexities of the AlphaFold2 modules are already well-known.\n\n> The main limitation of AlphaFold2, however, is its computational cost\n\n- I wouldn't call this the \"main\" limitation. The model isn't that great at proteins without deep MSAs, e.g..\n\n>We constructed a training set from the AlphaFold database. In particular, we first cluster the sequences from Uniref50 (Suzek et al., 2007) at 30% sequence similarity, and then select the structures with an average plDDT score above 0.7. This results in a high quality, diverse dataset of roughly 10 million structures.\n\n- If you're training on AF2 structures, especially exclusively, then a lot of your claims about certain components of AF2 being unnecessary could be called into question; this is effectively a form of distillation, not an independent competing architecture.\n\n>Our results show that MiniFold is competitive with other protein language model based structure prediction models, achieving over 95% of the state-of-the-art ESMFold at a fraction of the computational cost.\n\n- 95% is somewhat misleading. OpenFold shows that the full AlphaFold2 model reaches comparable lDDT levels almost immediately; almost all of the training time is spent closing roughly the same gap as the one between MiniFold and the full AlphaFold2 model."

            "questions": {
                "value": ">We perform several modifications to the Evoformer architecture, as shown in figure 2. First, we eliminate the sequence-level encoding and keep only the pairwise representation and update. Remarkably, this reduces the number of parameters from over 600 million to merely 3 million. In fact, we argue that the representational capacity of the Evoformer is influenced by the depth and complexity of its operations rather than by its parameter count.\n\n- Where does 600 million come from? AlphaFold2 has about 93 million parameters.\n\n>In addition, we eliminate the recycling operation used in both AlphaFold2 and ESMFold, as we found it only provides very minimal benefits that did not outweigh the additional computational cost.\n\n- This contradicts the ablations in the AlphaFold2 paper. In what sense does it only provide minimal benefits? On which sequences?"

                "value": "Currently, I give a score of 6. I am happy to increase my score if the below weaknesses (and questions) can be appropriately addressed.\n\n-  First of all, the authors clearly have dived into the (time and performance) ablation of AlphaFold2, ESMFold and MiniFold, which will be great to present. For example, how do time and performance change if we remove the triangular attention blocks? How is the performance change if we recycle MiniFold once / twice / third times?Theses results are not only useful for the design of MiniFold, but are also knowledge that people are curious about.\n- The second question relates to the third part of MiniFold (structural determination based on distance matrix). Why can't you directly build the 3D $C_\\alpha$ backbone based on the distance matrix (assuming that the matrix is filled)? In addition, how do you determine the side-chain angle?  \n- Third, I noticed that you built the model on a smaller (but pre-trained) ESMFold, right? In fact, one of the reasons why ESM and AF2 are so huge is that they train *from scratch*. I am not saying that using previous embeddings is not good, but an intermediate path to address the efficiency problems is to distill or prune the ESM model, or to use it as a teacher model to train a smaller model (since you have an infinitely large dataset now). Do you know any work about how this would be compared to MiniFold? What do you think is the pros and cons of different solution paths?\n- A minor point, I don't think \"removing\" cycling can be counted as your acceleration. This is entirely a time/accuracy trade-off, and can be easily achieved. I'd suggested the authors cycle MiniFold as well and compare the time.\n- Last but I am indeed curious: you mention that the Multiplicative layer can replace attention. Can you show how the performance changes after the replacement? In addition, this is also applicable to other fields, so I am curious why do you think this replacement can work well, and is it a domain-specific thing or not?"
