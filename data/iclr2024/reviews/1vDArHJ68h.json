Despite minor design choices, the major difference of this paper is that it conducts MBRL experiments while S4WM only conducts world model learning (e.g. imagination and reward prediction). However, in my humble opinion, it is not surprising that improvements in long-term memory can lead to improved MBRL performance in memory-demanding domains.\n2. Three kinds of actor and critic inputs are introduced, namely, output state, hidden state and full state, which results in a critical design choice to be tuned for each domain. Although the authors provide some takeaways to select between them, it is not always true. For instance, output state policy is utilized in memory-demanding environments, Bsuite, while hidden state policy is used in non-memory environments, DMC.\n3. The authors claim that R2I does not sacrifice generality for improved memory capabilities. However, there is a clear trend in Figure 6, that R2I performs worse than Dreamer in standard RL tasks. \n4. Some inaccurate statements. For example, the authors say R2I's 'objective differs from ELBO in three ways', but to my knowledge, these three points are all borrowed from DreamerV3 but without explicitly being mentioned in the text.\n\n[1] Deng et al.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- Despite the conducted ablation in Appendix O, the question on why the different input variations work differently across environments still remains open. And the raised hypothesis on \u201cfeature instability\u201d sounds vague and not properly backed up by a solid argument. It would be great to provide a better understanding of this challenge to give more clarity on how the method works, but I understand this is a difficult open problem that demands a careful investigation.\n\n- The work adopts SSMs to address the challenge of handling long-term dependencies in RL (memory and credit assignment). Nevertheless, it does not motivate the employment of Dreamer (or, more generally, Model-Based RL). I think it is important to describe and motivate why Dreamer was used instead of Model-Free RL, as it is not clear why MBRL would be better than MFRL for these memory tasks (unless there is another motivation besides asymptotic performance, such as sample efficiency).\n\n    - In the same line, Figure 4 brings some \u201cmemory-augmented\u201d Model-Free baselines, but it lacks \u201cPPO + SSMs\u201d. This baseline would definitely clarify my concern. If there is no constraint in the sample budget, it is possible (perhaps expected) that the MFRL agent would perform better.\n\n- In Section 4.3, the claim of \u201cnot sacrificing generality\u201d is questionable. There is a small drop in performance. For instance, in Appendix J (DMC-proprio), DreamerV3 is (at least) slightly better in 6 tasks.  In Appendix K (DMC-Vision), 8 environments. In Appendix L (Atari), 10 environments. I suggest rephrasing the claim to account what is observed in the Appendices.\n\n- The work from Deng et.al [1], proposing S4WM, looks very similar to the proposed one. Indeed, both works propose replacing the RSSM with SSMs with the same motivation: improving memory capabilities. The work on S4WM was publicly released approximately 2.5 months before this submission, which can be seen as concurrent work. Nevertheless, I believe the work is almost overlooked by the proposed paper, which has a small citation in Section 5. Given the similarity, it would be crucial to provide a more detailed comparison contrasting both works, in terms of methodology and evaluation, perhaps in the Introduction or in a separate Appendix.\n\n**Minor Concerns**\n\n- In Appendix H, task Autoencode: the episode length for the Hard task is 156. Is that right? I believe it is supposed to be 256.\n\n**References**\n\n[1] Deng et. al. Facing off World Model Backbones: RNNs, Transformers, and S4. NeurIPS, 2023.\n\n**Summary of the Review**\n\nThe work brings an effective improvement on World Models due to a well-motivated employment of State Space Models. This validates this architecture and extends its effectiveness in dealing with sequences in RL. The work does a great job in empirical analysis, anticipating many questions and answering them with extensive experiments and ablations. On the other hand, I believe the paper could be improved if the aforementioned concerns were addressed. Nevertheless, these concerns are not critical enough to prevent acceptance."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- In Appendix G (BSuite environment), is there any hypothesis on why sometimes harder environments (longer memory steps) present better performance than easier ones? For instance, R2I\u2019s performance on 31 memory steps is better than 15 memory steps. Similarly, the performance in 81 memory steps seems better (or more stable) than 41 memory steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n===================== **POST-REBUTTAL** ==================================\n\nDear authors,\n\nThanks for putting so much effort on addressing my concerns. I believe they led to substantial improvements in an already good work, so I am raising my scores towards acceptance.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- I appreciate the efforts on formulating hypotheses on why the different input variations work differently across environments. I believe the raised hypotheses are valid and potential venues for future work. As I mentioned before, this seems to be a difficult problem that requires careful investigation. It would be interesting to bring this rebuttal discussion into the paper, as I believe this could also be an important question for other readers. This is also valid to the point related to Appendix G.\n\n- I also would like to thank you for adding the new PPO + SSMs baseline. Turns out to be very different from what I expected, and given the discussion on Appendix T, I think it should require careful tuning to work with PPO (which is, indeed, a very sensible algorithm). But this is an argument in favor of the proposed method and perhaps another open question to be addressed (i.e., how to make SSM to work with PPO)\n\n- Thanks for addressing the tone of the claim in Section 4.3 and providing more evidence regarding it. I agree that given the diversity of environments, it is hard to ensure that all of them will attain the same performance, and the new wording also better reflects the presented results.\n\n- Lastly, the Appendix Q is great. I think this was one common concern from many reviewers and it was well addressed with many details. For sure the strongest reason to increase the scores."
