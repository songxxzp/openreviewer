The problem is decomposed into three stages, each stage requiring a separate network. At least two stages use a diffusion process, which means they involve multiple iterations, with a neural network inference step at each iteration. The first stage extracts features from the source image and source and target pose encodings. Next stage generates a coarse image, and the final stage involves refinement of the image.\n\nThe results outperform state-of-the-art in most metrics with a significant margin.

Is it a typical diffusion model for image refinement, or is there something special?

The results for DeepFashion show un-natural faces, and all faces look the same.

Perhaps a more detailed quantitative ablation study can better justify the model design.
