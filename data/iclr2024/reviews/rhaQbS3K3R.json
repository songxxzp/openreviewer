The crowdsourced, global data they consider are the DollarStreet and GeoDE datasets (released in prior work). They demonstrate that the geographic disparity (difference between the accuracy on European and African objects) increases as the models get better on ImageNet. They show that different robustness interventions and scaling the models and the datasets offer limited improvements, while training and fine-tuning on more diverse and carefully curated balanced data offers a path forward."

The experiment in Sec. 5.1. is consistent with prior/concurrent work: Rojas et al., DeVries et al. and Ramaswamy et al.\n2. The experiment in Sec. 6.3. is also aligned with prior work. Rojas et al. find that training on DollarStreet \"can improve the performance of classification tasks for items from lower-income homes\", while Ramaswamy et al. \"extract features using a ResNet50 model ... and retrain the final layer\".\n\nMeanwhile, I acknowledge that, in contrast to prior work, this paper performs a large scale study (with ~100 models) and examines the effectiveness of fine-tuning on one dataset (DollarStreet) and evaluating on another (GeoDE). However, the benefits of the later are also somewhat limited, as we can see in Table 8 - the results on GeoDE are similar regardless of the portion of DollarStreet training data (going from 10 to 100%).\n\nMinor: sometimes the legends and axes on the figures, e.g., on figs. 2 and 4 and 5 in the appendix are a bit hard to read."

Are there any fundamental differences between the two datasets?\n* Why is GeoDE omitted from Table 2. Rate of change on it seems closer to ImageNet-V2 and ImageNet-Sketch for example, compared to rate of change on DollarStreet.\n* Comparing Figs. 4 and 5 in App. B, the accuracies on GeoDE are significantly higher than those on Dollar Street and sometimes even higher than the ImageNet induced benchmarks. Why is that the case? Is GeoDE \"easier\" because there are fewer labels or is there another fundamental reason?\n* Do you have a hypothesis why the geographic disparities are much more consistent (relatively constant with the model improvements on ImageNet) for GeoDE compared to Dollar Street (Figure 8)? Why are the datasets different in that matter?\n\nQ2: I would like to better understand the driving source of the disparities on Dollar Street. Is it the geographic region or the family income? I expect that these two are correlated, but could you please provide any quantitative results about the disparity when also controlling for family income? I.e., instead of comparing the groups Europe and Africa, compare the groups (Europe, some income level) and (Africa, the same income level).\n\nQ3: Is \"Progress Gap\" a fair or meaningful metrics? E.g. (following-up on Q1), geographic datasets may be easier/more difficult, with different labeling biases, etc. Could you please provide a brief discussion what might influence the progress rates / contribute to its differences across datasets and further motivate the usage of the progress gap metric?\n\nQ4: Should we expect the models to have high accuracy on all regions? E.g., would fine-tuning w.r.t region deployment be a good idea in certain use cases? How do you envision the models should be deployed in practice? If we look at the problem from fairness perspective, it has been well-known that there exists a trade-off between fairness and accuracy in general, so it might make sense to have different models for the different regions."

Is it due to the dataset bias in training data? Is it because of the domain shifts/ label shift between different geographies? Although the current observation that there is a accuracy gap is important, it would be more useful if an inisght into the possible causes is also presented.\n\n- The authors note that they perform manual re-labeling of DollarStreet and GeoDA categories to ImageNet classes. Does this induce any kind of labeling noise which might explain the result? For example, images percieved by model to be `stove` are actually evaluated with `oven`. Since oven and stove designs change worldwide, could this be a possible reason for the accuracy drops? Adding to this, can you also choose only these classes from other robustness benchmarks as well? (Like select a subset of ImageNet-S with only those labels which were mapped to DollarStreet and then evaluate the accuracy). This somehow seems a more fair comparison.\n\n- Adding to the above point, it would be useful to include another contemporary dataset GeoNet [1] into the evaluation since they seem to directly source their dataset based on labels from the ImageNet (thus avoiding relabeling). \n\n- Several recent efforts to study the problem of geographical adaptation are not cited or compared [1,2,3]. GeoNet seems to be a relevant work which addresses similar issues with broadly similar observations. Specifically, the conclusion that scaling model sizes and datasets would not automatically yield geographical robustness seems related, but no discussion or comparison with this work is presented. \n\n- The disparity difference is only computed against Europe and Africa. Does the observations also hold for, say, Europe and Asia?\n\n- Sec 5.3: Could the authors hypothesize why rates of improvement across regions in GeoDE is much more uniform compared to DollarStreet?\n\n[1] Kalluri, Tarun, Wangdong Xu, and Manmohan Chandraker. \"GeoNet: Benchmarking Unsupervised Adaptation across Geographies.\" CVPR. 2023.\n\n[2] Prabhu, Viraj, et al. \"Can domain adaptation make object recognition work for everyone?.\" CVPR. 2022.\n\n[3] Yin, Da, et al. \"GIVL: Improving Geographical Inclusivity of Vision-Language Models with Pre-Training Methods.\" CVPR. 2023."
