                "value": "In this paper, the authors leverage the idea of using mixture-of-experts models to improve the model capacity for graph neural networks (GNNs). Since the GNNs are both expensive and hard to optimize, the authors propose mixing a light-weight multi-layer perceptron (MLP), with an off-the-shelf GNN rather than modeling each expert as a GNN. Here, the MLP specializes in extracting the rich self-features of nodes and it is referred to a weak expert, while the GNN exploits the structure of neighborhood and is called a strong expert. To aggregate these two models, the authors introduce a biased gating function towards the GNN predictions based on a novel \"confidence\" mechanism, and name this model \"Mowst\"\n\nFor inference, the authors run the weak expert first and obtain a prediction. If the confidence score of that prediction exceeds some random threshold, then it is selected as the final prediction. Otherwise, they continue to run the strong expert, and use the prediction of that expert.\n\nFor training, they propose the loss function $L_{Mowst}$ by firstly computing the losses of two experts separately, and then combining them via the confidence function $C$.\n\nIn addition, the authors also introduce a variant of the Mowst model in which they use the confidence function $C$ to combine the predictions of the two experts, and then calculate a single loss.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that both models are at least as expressive as the MLP or GNN alone but with a comparable computional cost. Finally, they empirically show that these models have significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks."

The authors try to improve the model's capacity in graph neural networks (GNN) without raising the computational costs. For making predictions, they introduce two experts: a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and an off-the-shelf GNN. The collaboration between these experts follows a system known as the mixture of experts (MoE), which is referred to as the confidence mechanism.  This gating scheme determines which expert's prediction should be chosen. The proposed solution employs two algorithms for both inference and training. During inference, a prediction is generated for each node, while during training, the MLP and GNN models are updated.

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The paper, in its current state, exhibits several deficiencies that require attention from the authors. The most significant issue with the paper is the absence of a clear presentation of the details of the proposed solution.\n\n- A Minor Issue: A minor issue I've observed in the paper is that on two pages, a significant portion of the content is dedicated to citations and references rather than the core content. On page 1, approximately 40 percent of the introduction is occupied by references, and a similar issue is present on page 6, where content presentation heavily relies on citations. While I understand that this issue may be related to the template used, it can inconvenience readers who may not wish to review all the references. It would greatly benefit the paper if the authors could pay attention to this issue to enhance the reader's understanding.\n\n- An important source of ambiguity arises in Algorithms 1 and 2. Algorithm 1 is responsible for generating predictions using the MLP or GNN, whereas Algorithm 2 focuses on estimating the parameters of the networks. The paper lacks clarity regarding the process when the MLP and GNN have not been trained, and Algorithm 1 does not contain an initialization step for their parameters or hyperparameters. It is imperative that the paper defines the interaction and collaboration between these two algorithms to address this issue. In particular, it is crucial to explain how Algorithm 1 can produce predictions when the experts have not yet been trained.\n\n- The loss functions in (Eq.1) and (Eq.3) play a crucial role in the training process, as they are meant to be minimized. However, an issue arises in these loss functions because all elements within them are known. Specifically, the confidence, and predictions of both experts and the true labels are all given. Algorithm 1 is responsible for generating confidence and predictions, while the true labels are known. This results in the loss function having a fixed value, and it remains unclear with respect to which parameters the minimization task is intended. As a result, the loss function appears to be independent of the experts' parameters. The paper should address and clarify this issue to ensure a proper understanding of the optimization process.\n\n- Confidence mechanism C: The paper introduces a novel gating variable, referred to as confidence, which holds promise for providing appropriate weightings in the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. However, a significant concern arises with the use of the random value q. The strategy resembles sampling techniques such as Metropolis-Hastings, where an acceptance ratio is compared with a generated uniform random number. Nevertheless, the fundamental problem here differs as the model's goal is to choose between experts. While the paper presents an innovative confidence mechanism, it ultimately compares it with a completely random value. This approach may not be a precise method for selecting one of the experts, as the confidence mechanism is inherently tied to the experts' predictions, while the ratio q is an independent value. The paper should address this issue to ensure a more reliable method for expert selection.\n\n- Limitations of the proposed solution based on MLP and GNN: It's important to note that available baselines often face challenges when dealing with graph inputs and have their own limitations. The paper introduces two experts, MLP and GNN. However, the use of MLP as an expert should be explored more thoroughly in the paper, particularly due to its potentially weak prediction quality. For example, if Algorithm 1 consistently generates small values for q, resulting in MLP being selected in most cases, questions arise about the guarantee for the prediction quality of the $M_{owst}$ method. Additionally, the paper should delve into the main advantages of using MLP compared to other potential candidates. The current discussion in the paper does not adequately address this scenario. On the other hand, the limitations of using an off-the-shelf GNN have not been sufficiently discussed. The paper should elaborate on how employing GNN as an expert can effectively address its known limitations. A more comprehensive discussion in these areas is necessary to provide a well-rounded understanding of the model's capabilities and potential challenges. \n\n- Computational complexity: While the paper briefly touches upon the complexity of the proposed model, it is imperative to provide a more comprehensive analysis of its computational efficiency, especially within the experimental context. The Abstract highlights the efficiency of the $M_{owst}$ method, making it essential for the authors to include sensitivity analyses related to the model's complexity in the experiments. This would help in quantifying the trade-offs between model performance and computational resources. Furthermore, the cost associated with the confidence mechanism, even if estimated using a simple MLP, should be clearly explained in the paper. Precise details on the computational cost will aid readers in understanding the practical implications of implementing this mechanism. Providing a more in-depth discussion and analysis of these aspects will enhance the paper's completeness and help readers assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach."

This, I believe, might be the actual contributing factor to their method's effectiveness. To substantiate their claims, the authors should consider conducting additional experiments. Specifically, they could compare the performance of a combination of shallow and deep MLPs, as well as  a combination of shallow and deep GNNs. Such experiments would provide a more convincing validation of their results.\n\nAdditionally, the introduction to the datasets used in the study requires enhancement. The authors should provide a detailed description of how each network dataset is constructed and clarify the specific features attributed to the nodes within these datasets."

This is particularly common when dealing with graph datasets featuring imbalanced classes or containing a small number of outlier nodes that may not be sufficiently representative. The authors didn't discuss the limitations of such cases and how mowest may or may not solve them.\n\n**Clarity:** There are several different design choices other than the proposed version. For instance, the authors do not provide a justification for positioning the weak expert at a lower order while placing the strong expert at a higher order. An alternative approach could involve computing confidence using the GNN and then determining the weight for further combining the MLP results. Another version might not involve confidence computation but instead rely on a learnable module to decide which expert is more suitable. Supervision can be obtained through self-supervision, i.e., comparing with a previously trained MLP and a GNN in terms of predictive accuracy on each instance.\n\n**Experimental justification:** The paper lacks results for Mowst*-GIN in Table 1. Including these results would be valuable for assessing whether Mowst can further enhance performance, especially since GIN is the top-performing model on Penn94. Moreover, demonstrating how Mowst can complement different GNN architectures would strengthen the assessment of its utility.\n\n**Experimental comparison:** It may not be fair to compare Mowst with either MLP or GNN in isolation. A more informative comparison could be made between Mowst and a GNN with an MLP skip connection since both have similar expressiveness (theoretically, when the strong expert is activated) and the same number of model parameters.\n\n**Minor:**\n\nIn the abstract, the authors mentioned \"GNN\" before \"... the strong expert is an off-the-shelf Graph Neural Network (GNN).\""

                "value": "Weaknesses:\n1. The presentation quality still has lots of space to improve. That's also the main drawback of this work. The motivation is not clear enough. I guess that the main motivation of this work is about how to overcome the challenges raised by heterophily since most of GNNs work well on homophily network. But there is no literature overview on overcoming heterohpily in the related work section. Moreover, no baselines for dealing with heterophily are included in the experimental section. It's better to illustrate the diagram of learning objective to show how the MLP and GNN collaborate to each other, since they are not applied to mode layers.\n\nApart from the missing literature, many claims in this work are not clear. Here a incomplete list. \n  - \"GNNs are both expensive to compute and hard to optimize\". By far, many efficient way to run GNNs are already proposed and applied to solve industrial problems. It should not be the main drawback of advanced GNN layer or model. Comparing with MLP, GNN indeed requires more computation cost, but we still have solutions to make it applicable to deal with large scale data. With the claim, what is it relation to the proposed method? It's difficult see that the proposed method has dominated advantage in terms of time complexity since it still relies on the GNN. \n   - \"a cluster of high homophily, the neighbors are similar, and thus aggregating their features via a GNN layer may not be more advantageous\". The \"similar neighbors\" should be more clear. Assume that this work mainly focuses on node classification according to the experimental tasks, similar neighbors tend to have the same class, but not mean that they should have close similar feature distributions. In this case, aggregating neighbors could bring missing information to the target node for better classification performance.\n  - \"The MLP can help \u201cclean up\u201d the dataset for the GNN, enabling the strong expert to focus on the more complicated nodes whose neighborhood structure provides useful information for the learning task. \" Could you please explain why a weak classifier can provide high-quality dataset for GNNs? From the information presented in this work, I guess it's just use the classification confidence distribution. Suppose that the cleaned nodes by MLP are those the low-quality nodes that have heterophilous neighbors, can the GNNs still distinguish them?\n  -  \"since the confidence score solely depends on MLP\u2019s output, the system is biased and inherently favors the GNN\u2019s prediction. However, such bias is desirable since under the same training loss\". It's difficult to follow the statement. Could you please explain the system is biased by what? why it favors the GNN prediction and the bias is desirable?\n  -  \"Second, our model-level (rather than layer-level) mixture makes the optimization easier and more explainable.\" What is the difference between model- and layer-level mixture, and why the optimization is more easier and explainable?\n  - \"During training, the system dynamically creates a soft splitting of the graph based on not only the nodes\u2019 characteristics but also the two experts\u2019 relative model quality.\" The splitting of graph is difficult to follow, is the graph divided by nodes or edges?\n\n2. The theoretical analysis can be further improved. For me, it's difficult to follow the conclusion from the series of theorems. It comes with weak connections to the proposed learning objective. It's better to make the point stand out with a clear statement, such as the convergence, stability of confidence value, insight about how to select probable confidence value function. By the way, the exact definition of the confidence value function seems to be missed.\n\n3. The experimental results are incrementally improved comparing to previous methods. Typical baselines for overcoming heterophilous issue are ignored, such as but limited to $H_2$$GCN [1].\n\nReferences:\n1.
