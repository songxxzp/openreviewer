            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The main weakness of this paper is some unclear explanations and descriptions.\n\n(1) The authors categorize existing methods into two classes, GAN-based and MAE-based methods, and emphasize that one of their  limitations is  the multiple running times to achieve the large expansion multiple. However, it is unclear why these two types of methods need to run multiple times. Using GAN or MAE is not the crux.\n\n(2) As the authors fail to clearly explain why previous methods cannot outpaint images with arbitrary and continuous multiples. The strengths and the contributions of the proposed method become unclear and unconvincing.\n\n(3) The authors say \"to achieve one-step diffusion-based generation, we propose to use relative positional queries and input sub-images as conditions\". This is really strange. Why relative positional queries can reduce the number of diffusion steps?\n\n(4) In section 3, the authors say that they set h1 = h2 = h and w1 = w2 = w for notation simplicity. It looks improper.\n\n(5) Some parts of Figure 2 are confusing. For example, in the training part, the relative positional embedding takes the two image views as inputs. But Eq.1 shows that only the relative position (m,n) is needed to generate the embedding. The images are not the inputs of it. In the sampling part, it is unclear what the inputs are. I cannot know which of the original image, the cropped image, and the masked image are the inputs\n\n(6) In Eq.2, it seems Xb0 should be Zb0\n\n2. There is a strange point in the proposed model. As shown in Figure 2, the relative position only reflects the position relations of the top-left corners between the two views. In other words, even the anchor view and the relative position are fixed, there can still be many different target views. How does this one-to-many mapping influence the model? Furthermore, in the sampling stage, if the input noise, image and relative position are all fixed, how to ensure the outpainting ratios on four edges are the same as what we expected?"

Assume the goal is to generate an outpainting image with a multiple of 10x given an input image of size (192, 192). Does PQDiff generate a (192, 192) version of the 10x outpainting image and have to leverage an additional decoder (perhaps super-resolution methods) to resize it to (1920, 1920)?\n\n- 2) Can the author provide results on more multiple besides (2.5x, 5x, 11.7x) used in other sota to justify their claim of continuous multiples? For example, how is the performance of 99x? My suggestion would be a figure of FID over continuous multiples or spectrums of outpainting images with increasing multiples.\n\n- 3) What is the quantitative evaluation of Sec 4.2 **Outpainting in an arbitrary position**, i.e. FID under different positions? Does the model prefer certain positions?\n\n## Suggestion\n- 1) The generated and input images in Supp. Sec. J (Fig. 11, 12, ...) can be put side by side for clearer comparison."
