The authors conduct extensive experiments and case studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of GNNBoundary. The generated boundary graphs are utilized to analyze various aspects of decision boundaries, including boundary thickness, margin, and complexity."

However, achieving this exact equality in probabilities is practically challenging. A more feasible approach might be to define the decision boundary within a specific interval or range of probabilities, ensuring a more robust and attainable characterization.\n\n2. In Section 4.2, the authors state: \"if traversal through decision region $R_{c3}$ is necessary, then $R_{c1}$ and $R_{c2}$ are not adjacent.\" However, the linkage between this statement and Algorithm 1 is not immediately clear. To enhance comprehension, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a more explicit explanation or illustration of how this concept is integrated into or related to the steps and operations outlined in Algorithm 1. \n\n3. There is no formal math definition of adjacency of decision region. The adjacency of decision region should be defined on the input space i.e., the graph sapce. However, the degree of adjacenct of class pair in algorithm 1 is only a quantitively approximation of the adjacency and obtained on the embedding space. \n\n4. Although the methods use some techniques to generate discrete node feature and edges, the degree of graphs should be varying even in one dataset. How do you determin the degree of boundary graphs which seems can only be pre-determined. \n\n5. The proposed GNNBoundary methods seems not be specific for graph fields. The author should compare it with other methods in more general fields such as  [Berk et al., 2022], discuss its applicability in more general fields. Also the author could concentrate more on graph since the name of method is GNNBoundary. \n\n\n6. There are some other typos such as the subscript of $\\phi$ in Line 4 of algorithm have different meaning."

The experiments are only conducted on two datasets, one being synthetic and another being real-world. The most important problem is that two datasets are not enough. Furthermore, these datasets are relatively small, and more importantly, the number of classes is extremely small (3 for Motif and 4 for COLLAB). We know that some graph classification datasets have only a small number of classes, however, as an explanation method, the authors should further explore the possibility of the method on larger datasets with a larger number of classes. This is also because the computation between different pairs of classes will significantly increase when the number of classes is larger.\n\n4.
