These patches represent local parts of an object. They then build class-specific memory banks containing patch embeddings extracted from known in-distribution samples. Apply coreset subsampling to reduce redundancy.  For testing, the authors propose a scoring function that extracts patch embeddings and find nearest neighbors in the memory banks. Evaluate novelty based on 1) distance to nearest patches and 2) entropy of class assignments. High entropy indicates the sample matches patches from many classes, suggesting it is OOD. Experiments show OpenPatch outperforms distance-based methods like nearest neighbors, as well as post-hoc methods that train classifiers on in-distribution data. It is also sample efficient, performing well even with few support examples per class."

                "value": "This paper presents a novel approach to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection in the realm of 3D data, termed OpenPatch. It addresses the challenge of detecting novel objects (OOD data) that a deep learning model has not encountered during its training phase. The core contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n(1) Development of OpenPatch: OpenPatch, a novel OOD detection method, leverages patch representations from intermediate layers of pre-trained 3D models. This approach enables the detection of novel 3D objects by differentiating between known and unknown object categories without the need for any additional training, addressing the limitations of previous methods that rely heavily on fine-tuning with extensive support data sets.\n\n(2)  Plug-and-Play Capability with Semantic Novelty Detection: OpenPatch operates as a plug-and-play solution for real-world applications, notably in industrial robotics, where computational resources and available data are limited. It is designed to detect semantic novelty effectively by comparing the test sample\u2019s patch features against a database of known classes, using distance metrics and entropy-based class assignment diversity to identify OOD instances, thereby mitigating potential operational hazards.\n\n(3) Demonstrated Superiority and Efficiency: The approach not only surpasses existing OOD detection methods in performance but also showcases high sample efficiency and resilience to domain bias. This makes OpenPatch highly suitable for practical applications, as it can be readily deployed without retraining for different tasks or updating the nominal support set, which is a significant advancement over existing 2D and 3D OOD detection techniques.\n\nIn summary, the paper introduces a robust and efficient method for detecting new objects in 3D data, which is of particular relevance for industrial applications and other real-world scenarios where data and computational resources are constrained."

Moreover, the experiments in Table1 are pre-trained on Objaverse-LVIS dataset, while Table 2 shows the results obtained when starting from the OpenShape pre-trained multimodal embedding. But I have some questions about the choices of comparison methods: \n\nA.In Table 1 and Table 2, compared with methods such as EVM and Mahalanobis that have been proposed for many years, if the latest research such as [1][2][3] are added to the comparison, can OpenPatch maintain its advantage?\n\n[1]Semantic Novelty Detection via Relational Reasoning\n\n[2]Detecting out-of-distribution examples with Gram matrices\n\n[3]Delving into Out-of-Distribution Detection with Vision-Language Representations \n\nB.If the latest research [4] and [5] are introduced into the backbone selection of Table 2, what changes will occur in the experimental results?\n\n[4]Uni3D: Exploring Unified 3D Representation at Scale\n\n[5]ViT-Lens: Towards Omni-modal Representations\n\n\n(2) As mentioned in 3.2, \"The banks\" cardinality may quickly increase, significantly impacting the computational cost of the method. To mitigate this effect and address redundancy we adopt a greedy coreset subselection mechanism.\u201d Can the impact of greedy coreset subselection mechanism on computational cost reduction be quantitatively reflected in the experiment?"
