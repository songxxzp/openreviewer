I feel it should be possible if we can construct a decent orthogonal basis on any metric space, is that true? But how to construct the function base is required but unknown.\n\n2. I agree it is relatively hard to explore multidimensional space $[0,1]^d$, but I feel the current results in this work on multidimensional space are still weak. From Table 1 the proposed OB-PE can achieve non-optimal regret bound under the condition $d < 2s$, which is not up to the state-of-the-art literature in this area. For implementation, both the number of arms and the dimension of arms would increase exponentially, and hence I am not sure whether it can still perform well in multidimensional space.\n\n3. Without knowing the value of $T$, I am not sure if the proposed algorithm still works since some settings (e.g. $N$) rely on the value of $T$.\n\n4. For the presentation of Algorithm 1, why don't the authors specify how to discretize the arm space directly there? It seems that discretization is unavoidable for OB-LinUCB and OB-PE."

It seems that you only use OB-LinUCB which is lack of strong theoretical support in your experiment. Why don't you use OB-PE as well since it has some good theoretical property instead? It seems there is some inconsistency between theory and experiments.\n\n2. I may overlook, but how many arms do you choose in experiments for OB-LinUCB? I think you discretize the interval [0,1] evenly (maybe with $\\sqrt{T}$ arms). Do you have any theoretical support for OB-LinUCB when discretizing the arm set? I think this is very important and should be illustrated in your main paper clearly.\n\n3. Some experiments one high-dim space (e.g. [0,1]^2) will make your experiments more reliable. I am concerned on the computational issue of the algorithm since the number of arms and dimension may explode exponentially."

This leads to an algorithm with optimal regret in some regimes and better computation time than prior algorithms in the literature.\n\nWhile I think the idea of this paper is novel, the theoretical regret bounds are only optimal in some regimes and the overall benefit especially over the cited algorithm UCB-Meta-algorithm is unclear."

Is this a reasonable assumption to make for common reward functions in stochastic optimization? Some discussion on this would be nice.\n* Looking at Table 1, it seems like the UCB-Meta-algorithm attains the optimal regret, while the main procedure of this paper OB-PE does not get optimal regret for $d>1$. The paper claims UCB-Meta-Algorithm has no regret guarantee for infinitely-differentiable rewards, but I don't see why I can't just run UCB-Meta-Algorithm with very large Holder exponent $s \\gg d$ which should get a regret bound which is nearly $T^{1/2}$ acccording to bounds of Liu et al., 2021. Thus, the only real advantage of OB-PE seems to be in time complexity.\n* There is a discrepancy between experiments and theory in the sense that the paper uses two different algorithms OB-PE vs OB-LinUCB for theoretical regret bounds vs experiments.

Why is this?\n\n# Writing Suggestions/Typos\n* The regret formula in the first paragraph should have the terms reversed in the difference.\n* In the fifth paragraph of page 1, the domain $[a,b]$ of $\\phi$ should be $[a,b]^d$?\n* I was confused why initially the reward function $f:\\mathcal{X} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ has unbounded scale, yet all the regret bounds seem to be scale-free. This is because the paper later on assumes $\\|f\\|_{\\infty}=1$, i.e. assumes knowledge of the scale of $f$. It might be better to just define bounded reward $f:\\mathcal{X}\\to [0,1]$ from the outset to not mislead readers.\n* Many environment references throughout the writing (e.g., algorithm 1, appendix 1, equation (1)) should have their names capitalized (e.g., Algorithm 1).\n* In Section 4.2, the Lipschitz constant $L$ is used before it is defined.\n* In the writing, \"s+1-th derivative\" would read better as \"(s+1)-th derivative\"."
