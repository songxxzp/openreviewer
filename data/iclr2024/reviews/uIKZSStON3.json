                "value": "The paper presents a novel algorithm called In-context Exploration-Exploitation (ICEE). Learning to learn in context is promising but demands extensive learning trajectory data and expansive training of large Transformer models. The ICEE algorithm is designed to address these challenges by augmenting decision transformers with an extra cross-episode return-to-go and training on concatenated episodic trajectories. It learns to balance exploration versus exploitation directly within the Transformer model during inference, eliminating the need for separate Bayesian inference processes. This enables ICEE to tackle Bayesian optimization tasks as effectively as methods based on Gaussian processes but at a notably faster rate. Experimental results show that ICEE can adeptly learn and solve new RL tasks with just tens of episodes, corroborating its efficiency."

First, it learns to explore and exploit across multiple episodes concatenated as one sequence, and secondly it is designed to exploit data generated from arbitrary policies that can, in principle, be highly inefficient. \n\nExperiments are conducted on two well motivated settings -- (1) bayesian optimization and (2) a family of episodic toy RL tasks in a 2d discrete maze.
