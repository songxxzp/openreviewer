The paper does not convincingly justify the necessity of such complexity in deep time series forecasting.\n\t- The authors should thoroughly discuss their modeling assumptions and their impact relative to alternative methods.

Are there other alternatives?\n\t- The rationale behind incorporating a multi-head convolutional self-attention mechanism should be explained.\n\t- While the authors aim to model interdependence across future horizons, they have not employed multivariate scoring rules to evaluate this aspect.\n\t- The paper asserts that recursive and direct strategies can yield high forecast errors, but it remains unclear how the proposed strategy compares with other forecasting approaches that use the same underlying model.\n\n- Experiments:\n\n\t- The choice of only three datasets for experimentation raises questions, as many machine learning papers on time series forecasting examine more extensive benchmark datasets. For example, see the Monash Time Series Forecasting Archive (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06643)\n\n\t- Many time series datasets exhibit a pronounced seasonal component that dominates the signal. Consequently, it may be challenging to surpass simpler methods that effectively estimate this seasonal component. The paper should address the strength of the seasonal component in the considered datasets.\n\n\t- The authors have not included simple benchmarks such as auto.arima or exponential smoothing in their comparisons.\n\n\t- Learning curves should be provided to demonstrate the stability of the training procedure.\n\n\t- The proposed method is trained using maximum likelihood estimation. The authors should also provide the negative log-likelihood (NLL) for all density-based methods.\n\n\t- The authors did not report standard errors and information regarding the number of runs performed.\n\n\t- The results for specific forecast horizons (e.g., h = 1, 2, 3, etc.) should be reported to assess if the procedure increases forecast error for initial horizons while improving the average error across horizons."
