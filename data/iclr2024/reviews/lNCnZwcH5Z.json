For example, in Section 2.1 Preliminary on Contrastive Learning, the notation, the ideas about the natural data vs. augmentation data, population data vs. empirical data, positive samples and negative samples could be introduced more thoroughly, as is done in HaoChen et al. (2021). I appreciate that this may be due to lack of available space.\n\nIn section C.1, it is stated that the feature transferability to downstream classification is evaluated without using the projector. Does this mean that the features used are not non-negative? Section 4.3 claims that the downstream classification \u201caligns well with the common belief that disentangled features are more robust against domain shifts\u201d, and yet the empirical and theoretical justification for the features being disentangled is based on the non-negative features (after the projector). This appears inconsistent.\n\nThe theoretical guarantees derived in the paper are based on assumptions. There is insufficient discussion of the applicability of these assumptions, and the guarantees, when real world data is used and the learned features are not ideal. For example, for each feature (representing a latent class), is there at least one sample in the data sets used that (approximately) only has that feature activated? Is learning something close to the ideal features reliant on a feasible amount of training data and a feasible amount of augmentations?\n\nIt is unclear to me why the feature selection task is chosen to show the sparsity of the NCL solution. Why is the sparsity evidenced by performance with a subset of the original features rather than a subset of the learned features?\n\nIn Appendix C.3, the derivation of lower bound of mutual information as the NCE loss should be more thorough, or cite a paper with a more closely aligned derivation, as it has a different form to the original paper (Oord et al., 2018). Also, the NCE loss does not include positive samples as it does in the main text. Is this intentional? \n\nThe expectation in equation 1 appears to be over just positive samples.\n\nThe paper would be more reproducible if the code were made public.\n\nComment: My initial rating is \"5: marginally below the acceptance threshold\", but if the points above are well-addressed, I would be willing to increase my rating."

Drawing inspiration from spectral contrastive learning (SCL) by HaoChen et al., 2021 and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), the authors proposed a contrastive loss that enforces non-negativity constraints on the extracted features.\n\nThe authors demonstrate that, assuming minimal class overlap, NCL has the potential to learn a set of sparse features with low correlation. Under a one-hot representation, NCL achieves orthogonality among its features (Theorem 4). Furthermore, when at least one sample is uniquely assigned to each class, NCL learns a set of distinguishable and disentangled features (Theorem 5).\n\nTo validate the effectiveness of NCL, the authors conducted experiments on three benchmark datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100, comparing it with a conventional contrastive learning methods, i.e. SimCLR. Across all datasets, NCL's features exhibit greater sparsity, consistency, and less entanglement, leading to improved representation of class identity in classification tasks."

Furthermore, the absence of a direct comparison between NCL and SCL is notable.\n\n- **Generality and applicability of NCL's representation:** While the authors have theoretically demonstrated that NCL can yield sparse and less entangled representations suitable for downstream tasks like clustering and classification, the critique is that the suggested definition for an optimal and interpretable representations does not necessarily covers the broader goal of capturing all latent factors within the data structure. In many practical applications, e.g. in VAE studies or mixture modeling, the aim is to obtain comprehensive representations that also cover continuous and non-sparse variabilities, which remains unaddressed in this work.\n\nI appreciate the problem addressed by the author and introducing the constrained contrastive learning, which I find intriguing.

When the text mentions *\"on average\"* it would be helpful to specify the number of runs that the average is calculated over.\n\n- In section 4.1, Results, it is mentioned that *\"The advantage is larger by considering the top features... since learned features also contain noisy dimensions.\"* This statement appears to be somewhat contradictory to the claim of a less-entangled representation."
