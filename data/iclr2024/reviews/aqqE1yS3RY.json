The dataset aims to fix some issues in existing datasets, in particular, the authors argue that existing benchmarks are not very granular and too easy with models either achieving perfect accuracy or random guessing. The authors further propose an evaluation technique that is more principled than existing techniques, that takes also into account numerical errors."

The tasks are very synthetic and even though I agree with the authors that the BREC dataset seems more interesting than existing benchmarks such as CSL, in my opinion it seems to be a marginal improvement over such datasets in terms of the novelty factor. There is definitely a need for such datasets in the community and the new evaluation technique is interesting, but I am not convinced that in its current state the work is fit for ICLR. Overall, this feels more of an \"extension\" to current datasets than something very novel."

I understand that the work is proposing a new dataset and a new evaluation technique for it (which I find to be interesting and valid), but are there further novel contributions?"

To overcome the dilemma between false negative and false positive, the authors propose RPC that includes similarity comparisons and internal fluctuation considerations. Moreover, the authors propose to adjust the similarity threshold adaptively.\n5. The code is well-organized."
