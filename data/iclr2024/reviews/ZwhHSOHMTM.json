                "value": "The goal of this work is to infer community structure in neural networks (specifically that of _C. elegans_) based on functional data. To do this, the authors 1) define a pairwise affinity score computable from single-neuron time series; 2) use tensor factorization to group these pairs into dynamical motifs; 3) feed tensor components from these motifs into a community detection algorithm. When applied to data recorded from individually identified _C. elegans_ neurons, this produces networks that are tested in validation experiments, which find that perturbation of key nodes does affect network structure and behavior related to, e.g., salt avoidance."

Related, but along the opposite direction: why not include strong _anticorrelations_ in the affinity score? Shouldn't two neurons whose activity moves opposite to one another at most times be considered related/coupled?\n- The tensor factorization will tend to treat affinities independently of one another, though the $N(N-1)/2$ affinities result from only $N$ neuronal time series. That is, the tensor factorization does not respect the underlying geometry of the problem. It's unclear to me how big an issue this is in practice, but it might lead to issues with the method.\n- While the experimental data are a definite plus, it's always unclear how strongly they should be taken as validation of a particular data analysis method. In a strongly coupled network, ablating any one neuron is likely to have an effect, and it's not shown that that the method proposed here would necessarily outperform others for selecting which perturbations to apply."

It would be better to include more related baselines. In the literature, there are several learning methods that learn the structure of the brain networks. Based on the current set of baselines, the proposed method shows superior performance, but existing baselines are general graph learning methods and do not use special properties of the brain. Therefore, I suggest adding additional brain network-based graph learning approaches as baselines. \n\n3.

It would be great if the authors could provide more information about the efficiency of the method."

The method is based on a three-step procedure. First, time-varying affinities between pairs of neurons are computed based on concurrent changes of the neuronal signal. Second, a non-negative tensor decomposition is employed to identify neuronal-temporal motifs of affinity across animals. Thirdly, community structure is inferred from the motifs using a stochastic block model. Taken together, these steps enable an interesting visualization of dynamical functional connectomes. The authors apply their method to experimental data recorded in C. elegans during a stimulus avoidance / attraction paradigm and identify a neuron previously not implicated in salt sensing. They then experimentally test its role by exposing worms with / without the neuron silenced to a salt stimulus and find that indeed the worms respond behaviorally as predicted."

In particular, it is unclear to me why the problems in constructing a time-varying similarity measure, that the authors discuss in the second paragraph of Section 2.1, does not also apply to the derivatives of the calcium traces? Since the derivatives represent the influx/outflux of calcium, and are thus likely a better representation of the neurons' firing rates, I would think that similar problems persist? Also, it is not clear to me why the local differential affinities should be non-negative? One could argue that two neurons also form a network if one inhibits the other, which in my understanding would lead to a negative affinity?\n\nA further (and significant) weakness is that no link to code is provided in the manuscript. I believe that making all code publicly available is absolutely essential for reproducibility."

Have you looked into proper distance metrics for symmetric matrices [1]?\n* What does \"CP\" stand for on page 4? That abbreviation is not introduced?\n* Why was the set of neurons restricted to sensory and inter-neurons? Did the results change when using all neurons?\n* Would the method also work on other neuronal data modalities, e.g., spiking data?\n\n1. Vemulapalli, Raviteja, and David W.
