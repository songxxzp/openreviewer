However, I have two concerns:\n\n(1) The physical meaning of each term is not new, it is widely known that to improve generalization, we need to learn domain-invariant representation that also follows some causal constraints; recent studies also emphasized the role of incorporating prior information from oracle model or a pool of pre-trained models. In this sense, even though Eq.~(3) is a high-level summarization, it does not contribute new insights to the problem of DG.\n\n(2) Table 1 is nice. However, it is hard to convince me that it summarizes most ideas from existing DG paper. At least, some recent papers are not included, which also aim to learn invariant representation from a causal perspective, or also incorproate some information-theoretic regularizatioin terms:\n\n[1] Arjovsky, Martin, et al. \"Invariant risk minimization.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1907.02893 (2019).\n\n[2] Ahuja, Kartik, et al. \"Invariance principle meets information bottleneck for out-of-distribution generalization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 34 (2021): 3438-3450.\n\n[3] Zhao, Shanshan, et al. \"Domain generalization via entropy regularization.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 33 (2020): 16096-16107.\n\n[4] Liu, Xiaofeng, et al. \"Domain generalization under conditional and label shifts via variational bayesian inference.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2107.10931 (2021).\n\n2. Some points are not clear to me:\n\n(1) Eq.(7) is a bit unclear to me. It seems that the objective of GAim1 is $\\min H(P(\\phi(X),\\psi(Y)|D))$ (according to your Table 1), \nthen does Eq.~(7) aim to say GAim1 <= GAim1 + GReg2?\n\n(2) The GReg2 is simple and novel to me. Could you please explain more why minimizing the shift between unconditional and conditional features can be used to mitigate invalid causality? \n\n(3) Why the term $a$ in Eq.~(5) is a constant w.r.t to $\\phi$ and $\\psi$? If we change either $\\phi$ or $\\psi$, the value of $a$ will change as well?\n\n3. The results in Table 6 only contain two state-of-the-art methods. It is highly recommended to incorporate more results, \nat least IRM, IRM+IB, etc. Otherwise, it is hard to judge, among the four terms, which term contributes more. It is also hard \nto judge the performance improvement of the new method."

Thus, the novelty of associated parts except the $Y$-mapping in the general learning objective is limited. \n\n## Quality & Clarity\n* Although this paper claims the theory contribution, I have not seen formal results and the theoretical contributions may be over-claimed.\n* Experimentally, the computational cost of the proposed framework has not been discussed.\n* The structure of this paper needs to be improved. For example, while the name of Section 4 is \"Validating Proposed Objective: Theoretical Analysis\", I have not seen some formal theoretical results but many experimental results. \n\n## Significance\n* This paper may have little effect on other sub-areas of machine learning."

Computationally, does the proposed method have a higher cost than related baselines?\n\n3. In Table. 1, the part of (Ours, Reg1), why optimize the $\\psi$ while the objective function has no function of it?\n\n4. In Table. 2 (and Eq.(10)), it is weird to consider the mapping $C: \\psi(Y) \\rightarrow Y$ since we cannot do that in test time. Please give explanations."
