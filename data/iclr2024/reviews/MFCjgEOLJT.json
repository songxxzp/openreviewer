                "value": "This manuscript provides a framework for modeling the behavior of the larval zebrafish using a control theoretic and dynamical systems framework. They model the behavior of a system as arising from a dynamical system driven by sparse inputs with a students-t distributed prior. They assume behavior is generated from the dynamical system by either a linear or RNN model, and use iQLR-VAE to infer model parameters and the sparse inputs. In each case they use a model truncation approach to reduce the number of dimensions considered. They begin by validating the approach on a double pendulum oscillator system, showing they could reproduce the number and values of eigenvalues. Then they analyze a dataset of larval zebrafish behavior, which is organized into discrete bouts and thus a natural test case for this approach. They find they need high capacity models (120 latent dimensions, 10 control inputs) to fit the behavior. They show that the resulting representation is useful, in that the dynamical representations provides a more disentangled input that can be better decoded from the top 5 PCs compared to the postural representation or even the full time series in some cases. By using model reduction, they show the dynamics underlying behavior can be decomposed  into separate modes."

I wonder how  the proposed framework would perform if the authors created the observations for the same system parameters with the nonlinear dynamics, and for parameter sets that result in increasingly larger angles. I think in this toy example it is interesting to demonstrate the robustness of the linear-reduced order framework.\n\n- In Figure 3 why does the classification accuracy decrease with time (observation time?)?\n\n- In Figure 4C and associated main text, the authors mention that the reduced model added eigenmodes with larger timescales, while it neglected the small timescale modes of the the non-reduced system. While the second part of the previous sentence is expected, I am not sure how should I understand the first one. Can you provide some intuition. Also related to this, when I first looked at Figure 4C I thought that the large the large time scale values of the reduced and non-reduced model overlap, therefore the light grey ones are not visible. Can you probably make the circles of the reduced system non-opaque or non-filled to make the plot clearer?\n\n- I think it would be helpful if the authors mention in the supplement how they fit the linear model of their framework, and provide a brief description of the iLQR-VAE framework that is a crucial component of the proposed approach.\n\n- Model Selection C.1. section is missing from the supplement.\n\n- There is a typo in the subscripts in Eq. 5."

While the model reduction technique for linear models is not usually applied to this field of behavioral modeling, it is a very well-known concept and does not offer novelty from a methodological perspective. There are interesting takeaways from a neuroscience perspective, but these would have to be validated more thoroughly and may be more suitable for a different venue.\n\nThe kinematics of the zebrafish are somewhat simple; however, the naturalistic behaviors of other animals (mice and monkeys, for example) are much more complex. Will the model still be able to capture these dynamics? One real-world dataset may not be able to provide enough insight about the generalizability of the model for this question.\n\nThere is no comparison with other models presented.\n\n\nMinor:\n1.
