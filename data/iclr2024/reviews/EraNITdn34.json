                "value": "- Significance: Lin et al. 2023 [1] demonstrated that the output layer of pre-trained text encoders do encode similarities or structure in tokens. This seems to contradict the authors claim and Figure 4 that vanilla training does not contain structure of the features? Is the lack of feature token transferability specific to tabular datasets? If so, is this solving a narrow or a domain specific problem, or would it generalize to any language model that uses a tokenizer?\n- Incremental performance: Table 1 shows that TabToken only leads to a marginal improvement (< 0.2 accuracy and < 3 RMSE), some of the baselines are non deep learning methods. Figure 6, also shows marginal improvement of TabToken compared to other methods with increasing feature ratios. Table 2 also shows incremental improvement or even a decrease in performance when combining existing models with CTR. Is this why the improvement or deprovement with CTR was not highlighted using bold numbers in table 2? \n- Difficulty of datasets used: The number of features in the datasets span between 8 to 54 in table 3. With a small dataset scale, non deep learning methods actually perform better. Could the paper be a case of using an over-engineered solution? More importantly, the benefits of using TabToken to improve deep learning algorithms becomes questionable since the dataset complexity is not at scale to employ deep learning methods. Perhaps pre-training or finetuning only the tokenizer might be relevant and the encoded features can be passed to a non deep learning classifier such as SVM? This could alleviate the complexities of training deep learning classifiers and focus the problem of learning good feature representations.\n\n[1] Lin, Z., Azaman, H., Kumar, M. G., & Tan, C. (2023).

Tabular data contain unique column features with their categorical or numerical values, making it challenging to transfer knowledge from pretraining data to unseen downstream data. To address this issue, the authors employ a contrastive regularization objective to learn semantic tokens for each column feature. Few-shot downstream tasks can leverage these overlapping semantic tokens. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in few-shot classification and regression tasks."
