Unlike prior related works that need full model access in the training, this work chooses to utilize large foundation models, with only the access to APIs (without knowing model weights or even without the need of training).  The PE algorithm is inspired by the evolutionary algorithm, which essentially iteratively refines the generation result so that the generation is close to the private set. The FID and some downstream tasks show its effectiveness."

Though the result looks nice, I am so unconvinced it is true. A generative model basically learns the training distribution, so that it can generate something similar to the training set. However, if the training distribution is different from what you want to generate, how is it possible? Sec 5.1.1 looks reasonable, because the distribution of CIFAR10 has a large overlap with (or maybe is even covered by) ImageNet. However, CAMELYON17 is totally different from ImageNet, why is a diffusion pretrained on ImageNet able to generate CAMELYON17 images? The authors did not give any formal or intuitive explanations on this point.\n3. Based on the second concern, it would be more clear and intuitive to highlight samples that are used to update the histogram in each iteration. For example, in Figure 19, iteration=0, what generative samples (I believe not all of them) are closer to the private set and thereby used to update the histogram? \n4. By reading Alg. 2, it looks to me that it is possible that the histogram will be more and more concentrated on some samples when the overlap between the generation set and the private set is small, thus implying that the variation of the generation can be low."

                "value": "1. I find it hard and a bit confusing to track the pretrained model information in the paper. The term \"pretrained model\" and \"API\" seem to be interchangeably used, but you have two APIs. For example, in App. I, you mentioned only one pretrained model, is that your random_API? In  API implementation, you mention both APIs, and the variation_API is SDEdit. Is it also pretrained on ImageNet?\n2. It makes no sense to compare the performance at different $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-DP, such as the comparison in Sec 5.1.2. Why not targeting the same DP guarantee?\n3. In App. H - \"Conditional pre-trained networks/APIs\", it says that \"In the subsequent VARIATION API calls (Line 6), for each image, we will use its associated class label or text prompt as the condition information to the API, and the output samples from VARIATION API will be associated with the same class label or text prompt as the input sample.\" Do you use this strategy in Sec 5.1.2 experiment? If so, how did the label of ImageNet guide the generation of Camelyn17?\n4. Fig. 19(a) is the output of random_API (iteration=0), but some images look weirdly pink-ish, e.g. col 1 row 7, col 7 row 6, col 8 row 10, while the rest looks gray-ish. This is weird if the random_API is well pretrained. Do the authors have any interpretations?"

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. **Privacy guarantee**: 1) The query at each iteration depends on the output of the last iteration; such adaptive queries lead to correlated outputs. This may potentially amplify the privacy loss. 2) If the underlying model of the API memorizes information from the queries (and can even update the model based on user interactions, such as what OpenAI does for GPT-4), there could be long-term privacy implications, especially that at later iterations, the data fed back to the API are highly similar to the private data.\n2. **Generalization beyond images**: The algorithm in this paper is highly dependent on the capability of the API. In this work the authors only focused on the image data. Can the authors comment on the generalizability of the method on other data types, e.g., text data, tabular data, etc.?\n3. **Conditional generation**: The authors treat the conditional generation as unconditional generation for each class. This is a valid approach, but think about the scenario where there are many classes and only a few images per class (e.g., CelebA dataset with 10k classes and ~20 images per class), it may be better for the algorithm to not limit itself to one class of data. Can the authors comment on how they would adapt the algorithm for such type of data, and the utility? (One might expect that the threshold needs to be low to accommodate for the few number of images per class, but this means more noise).\n4. **Monetary cost of the algorithm**: The authors mentioned the foundation models \"including GPT4, Bard, and DALLE2 (that) only provide API access without releasing model weights or code\". For those models: 1) often the API calls are not inexpensive; 2) they may support fine-tuning access. Can the authors discuss the costs of the two routes (DPSDA vs. DP finetuning)? \n5. **Diversity-utility trade-off**: I'm curious about whether calling more VARIATION_API will hurt the utility. Apparently the diversity increases because there's no longer constraints in producing nearest neighbor images. But without this constraint, and without the knowledge of how the foundation model API produces a \"similar\" image, how can we be sure about retaining similar level of data utility? The results in Fig. 5 are encouraging results, but I'd appreciate more evaluation to directly corroborate the argument, e.g., using the initial 50k images to train a classifier, and compare with another 50k after calling the API for a few times.\n6. **Missing related work**: A few published works on DP synthetic data are missing, to name a few, [1,2,3].\n7. **Evaluation**:\n   1. Fig. 6 presented generated Camelyon17 images with (9.92, 3x10^{-6})-DP. I wonder why the authors didn't report the accuracy on this generated dataset while instead reported the numbers for the \\epsilon=7.58 dataset? Clearly it's more fair to compare the \\epsilon=9.92 results with the \\epsilon=10 results from the prior work. I appreciate it if the authors can add the result.\n   2. More details on ensemble in the main paper is appreciated. Are the 5 classifiers trained on disjoint datasets each of 0.2M samples? Is this the same setup as Ghalebikesabi et al.? (because 0.2M samples for a CIFAR classifier seem a lot.) \n   3. I appreciate the effort of the authors putting up their own private dataset for evaluation. However, I have reservations about the experimental setting in Sec 5.2. In its current form, Sec 5.2 only serves the visual demonstration purpose. But one dataset with datapoints contributed all by one single identity makes little sense when talking about DP. A dataset with e.g. 5 cats and 20 images each would be better. It would be possible to further evaluate the utility of the synthesized data then.\n8. **Minor**\n   1. Grammar issue: Sec 4.1, \"the (privatized) number of private numbers whose\"\n   2. The position and the order of the footnotes are messed up\n   3. It is not appropriate to use \"Cat Cookie\" and \"Cat Doudou\" in a research paper.

Section 4 starts by saying \"Data type. While our framework above and our algorithms in \u00a7 4 are general for any data type, we focus on images in our experiments.\" However, it is not clear how this can be done for example for text because of the complexity of textual information and also for audio because of the lack of speech-based APIs. I would either remove this statement or try to discuss how this extension can be done.\n4) As this paper says in Section 4 \"Foundation models have a broad and general model of our world from their extensive training data.\" so how do you make sure the images that you consider as private (for example CIFAR-10 in your case) are not used in the training of foundation models of used APIs? I think this somehow affects the practicality of the proposed method in practice. After reading the experiment section, it seems this paper does not use real-world APIs and instead, this paper tries to simulate this in a controlled environment by considering pre-trained models.\n5) The claim of the proposed method being easier to deploy than existing methods is not supported. I would at least empirically validate this by measuring its costs in comparison to existing ones.\n6) It would be good to also talk about the limitations of DP synthetic data in general especially when data is distributed across users and cannot be centralised in one place."

The real private distribution is represented as a histogram, , which quantifies how frequently each current synthetic sample is the nearest neighbor (determined by l2 distance in an embedding space) to real data samples from the private dataset. To achieve DP, noise is added to the histogram.

A more in-depth exploration of the limits (in terms of tolerance to distribution shifts) of the pure API method (potentially by considering other medical datasets) and a discussion on potential refinements or extensions of the proposed approach would further strengthen the submission."

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Several hyperparameters appear to be crucial for the proposed approach, including the threshold for DP NN and the lookahead degree. It would be helpful to provide further discussion on the selection of these hyperparameters. Specifically, insights into their transferability across different datasets and any computational trade-offs in practical scenarios would be beneficial.\n\n- I appreciate the qualitative results, such as the generated samples and their NN among real data. However, I would expect additional quantitative evaluation, perhaps in the form of histograms or average results, for the NN distances (both from real to closest generated and from generated to closest real). This may help provide critical insights into the fidelity of the generated samples, the approximated data likelihood, and the empirical privacy leakage."
