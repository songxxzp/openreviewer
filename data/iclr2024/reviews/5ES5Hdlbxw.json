The key observation is that many environments can be solved by a few steps of value iteration starting with the uniformly random policy, meaning that sophisticated exploration is unnecessary. Based on the observation, this paper designs a novel provable RL algorithm called SQIRL that runs a few steps of fitted-Q iteration, and the sample complexity of SQIRL is only exponential in (roughly) the number of value iteration steps needed to solve the environment. This paper also shows empirically that the sample complexity of SQIRL correlates with the sample complexity of standard deep RL algorithms such as DQN and PPO."

In recent work, Laidlaw et al., 2023, \"Bridging RL Theory and Practice with the Effective Horizon\", the authors have shown that deep-RL methods succeed in (deterministic) MDPs, especially in cases in which it is sufficient to take few \"greedyfication\" steps from the Q-function of the random policy (i.e., the effective horizon). In this work, the authors show that these claims can be extended to stochastic MDPs by introducing the \"stochastic effective horizon\". More specifically, the paper is articulated in the following points:\n1. The authors provide a formal definition of the \"stochastic effective horizon\" notion that presents itself as the natural extension of the effective horizon introduced by Laidlaw et al., 2023. \n2. Secondly, the authors propose a simple algorithm (SQIRL) whose sample complexity scales exponentially with the stochastic effective horizon (which is typically much smaller than the optimization horizon of the underlying problem).  \n3. On a stochastic extension of the benchmark Bridge (Laidlaw et al., 2023), the authors show that modern deep-RL algorithms performance significantly correlates with the empirical success of SQIRL. This empirical phenomenon suggests that the concept of stochastic effective horizon can explain some of the reasons behind the success/failure of modern deep-RL methods."

In this sense, the work done by the authors goes in this direction, as the problem deserves attention from the community (both practitioners and theoreticians).\n2.

In this work, instead, the authors propose an extension to the more general (and challenging) stochastic environments.

                "value": "**1. Novelty**\n\nFirst, I remark that the main contribution done by the authors goes into the direction of providing explanations behind the success of deep-RL algorithms. Although these explanations are highly appreciated, it has to be remarked that the main idea on which the work is built has been already proposed in Laidlaw et al., 2023. Indeed, in Laidlaw et al., 2023, the authors have shown that deep-RL succeed in (deterministic) MDPs especially in cases in which it is sufficient to take few \"greedyfication\" steps from the Q-function of the random policy. In this sense, the novelty, in terms of new explanations that are given to the success of deep-RL algorithms is somehow limited. The contributions of the authors, in this sense, is limited to to the extension to stochastic environments.\n\n**2. Theoretical claims and analysis**\n\nI have concerns regarding the theoretical claims done by the authors, especially regarding the main Theorem (i.e., Theorem 3.6). Specifically, I checked the proofs behind Theorem 3.6, and there are some steps that are unclear/unprecise/uncorrect (p.s., I haven't had a look in details to the other sections of the appendix, so I am unaware if there mistakes in those parts). \n\nFirst, I begin with the result on the sample complexity (Eq. 1). Using standard tools from the bandit community, it is possible to show that, for $\\epsilon$-best arm identification with 2 arms, the Lower bound is given by $\\widetilde{\\Omega}[ \\max \\left( \\Delta^{-2}, \\epsilon^{-2} \\right) ]$ (RL with 1 state, depth 1, and 2 actions). In Eq. 1, instead, the authors claim a complexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-1})$, which is clearly impossible. It seems to me that the main problem is that the authors masked inside the $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}$ instant dependent quantities such as $\\Delta^{-2}$. \n\nSecondly, I invite the authors to provide details on the last step behind the proof of Lemma B.1. To me, it seems that they upper-bound $P_\\pi(\\mathcal{E}) \\le \\epsilon$, but, then it is unclear how they upper bound the cumulative sum of rewards to $1$.\n\n(minor) some assumptions in Lemma B.1 are not used. For instance, k-solvability seems to be not used within the proof.\n\nOverall, I currently believe that all these issues could be solved, leading to results comparable (or maybe, slightly worse) to the one presented in Theorem 3.6. Nevertheless, the paper, at its current status, seems to be lacking in formal correctness.\n\n**3. Weaknesses of the proposed algorithm (minor)**.\n\nIt has to highlighted that the algorithm proposed by the authors needs to be aware of the k parameter of K-QVI-solvability property. This parameter is often unknown in practice. I consider this to be a minor weakness, as the purpose of this work is not to propose an algorithm (with theoretical guarantees) that can be applied in practice, but rather it focuses on explaining why deep RL algorithms succed in practice. \n\n**4. Minor comments:**\n- Colors in Figure 2 seems to be swapped. I currently read the Figure as follows: PPO fails most likely with small values of k (however, I guess the opposite claim should be the correct one)."

The strong claim of in-distribution generalization: On page 6 the authors claim that if we can properly regress for approximate-Q then we can also estimate the maximum action properly. The claim seems to be too strong without evidence: With finite data, the Q will almost always have errors. These errors will lead to perhaps suggesting actions OOD and lead to overestimation bias commonly observed in deep RL. This analysis seems to be missing in analysis of FQI for SQIRL.\n3. A minor nitpick: Unlike GORP, the whole set of stochastic environments are not explained by SQIRL - I think the title and introduction implying something more stronger that it should?\n4. Sticky action is a particular kind of stochasticity - More ways of inducing stochasticity and varying the noise std can make the empirical experiments stronger.\n[1]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01715.pdf\n[2]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.01715.pdf\n[3]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05556.pdf"
