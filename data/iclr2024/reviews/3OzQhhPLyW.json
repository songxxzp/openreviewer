                "value": "Recent works in multi-agent learning focus on reasoning about inter-agent interactions. One such algorithm is Learning with Opponent Learning Awareness (LOLA), which looks ahead utilizing gradient descent. The work builds on the LOLA framework by casting the problem as a meta-game of optimization. Meta-Value Learning (MeVa) learns a meta-value function (expected discounted return over future iterates) and applies a form of Q-learning to evade representing the continuous action space. The inner loop corresponds to collecting a policy optimization trajectory using gradient descent on iterates of the meta-value. The outer loop corresponds to learning the meta-value function by minimizing the TD error. MeVa incorporates design considerations such as empirical corrections in Bellman updates, variable discounting and gaussian noise as exploration. Results in a logistic game and repeated matrix games demonstrate improvements over LOLA agents."

Specifically, it is essential that the gradient of the iterates is consistent. It would be helpful if the authors can highlight any practical considerations to mitigate high variance in the gradients. Authors could also provide standard deviations of different trials for Tables 2 and 3 in order to evaluate the effect of noisy gradients (if any).\n* **Ablations:** Appendix F provides a range of ablations for design considerations utilized in MeVa. However, an important comparison would be to assess the importance of the meta-value function formulation itself. Authors should compare the surrogate formulation of Eq. 6 with the naive infinitely discounted sum of Eq. 5. Similarly, the choice of a sophisticated exploration strategy, which is Gaussian noise, could be evaluated by comparing it with standard exploration schedules used for TD learning such as $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration or action noise. Current ablations only enable/disable exploration which do not reason about the choice of schemes and their importance.\n* **Related Work:** The paper cites relevant works from multi-agent learning and opponent awareness literature. However, their organization within the paper could be improved. Authors could organize recent literature in a dedicated related works section or discuss the improvements of MeVa over prior methods (as done for LOLA in Introduction).\n\n[1].

            "questions": {
                "value": "- Section 1: (Clarity around Proposed improvements to LOLA): You state that your approach is self-consistent and explain that it \"does not assume the opponent is naive and that it is aware of its own learning as well\". I find this point unclear and/or redundant.\n\n  In my understanding, the first claim is that the policy convergence of your algorithm does not depend on the opponent following a particular algorithm (specifically, an algorithm that is not learning aware). This is interesting, but can be stated more clearly.\n\n  I think the second claim is that your algorithm is aware of its own learning process. But this is also true of LOLA to a first-order approximation, correct?.\n\n  The second contribution states that other approaches to estimating the meta-value using extrapolation using naive learning. Again, the framing around naive vs non-naive learning is confusing and it may help to state explicitly what this means earlier than section 2.1 if it is a focal point of section 1.\n\n- Section 1 (Clarity around Extrapolation): You refer to the term \"extrapolation\" but do not define it and I do not think it is common terminology. I assume extrapolation refers to the policy being followed in the bootstrapping step, but I am not sure.\n\n\n- Section 2.2: You introduce LOLA and a few variants before introducing the proposed algorithm. There seems to be more than a few connections between those previous approaches and the meta-value function approach, and I think the paper would benefit from circling back and relating the proposed algorithm to previous work. The results section, for example, only shows the performance benefit of the proposed approach without a clear demonstration of why or how the extended predictions provided by the value function are beneficial.\n\n- Section 2.3 (M-FOS Description): Contrasting the description of M-FOS here with the earlier one, I do not see how M-FOS can be simultaneously \"solving the inconsistency\" and \"not learning, but acting with learning awareness\". If the value function does solve the inconsistency then learning an arbitrary meta-policy from this value function should be seen as \"learning with learning awareness\" rather than merely acting.\n\n- Section 3 (In place of implicit gradients) At the end of section 3 you remark that once the meta-value function is trained, you can substitute the gradient of the approximation with the implicit gradient of the real meta-value funciton. What is not obvious to me is where the gradient of the implicit meta-value function was used i nthe first place.\n\n\n- Section 4.1 \"This variant is more strongly grounded in the game and helps avoid the detachment from reality that plagues bootstrapped value functions\"\n  Related to my last point, I do not see the proposed advantage. I do not know what it means for something to be more grounded in a game, nor how this reformulation achieves that.\n\n- Section 4.3 (Exploration): I understand that there is a balance between too much noise for learning and too little noise for exploration. The proposed approach, flipping the sign of the final layer, and the accompanying explanation does not make sense to me. Of course perturbing the output layer would change the behavior of the inner policy, but this seems like a very crude source of noise in comparison to the conventional approach of small gaussian noise added to all parameters.\n\n  I am also confused as to why there are interleaved perturbed and unperturbed rollouts. If the unperturbed rollouts are used to update V, then does that mean the exploration procedure is closer to \"exploring starts\"\n\n- Section 3 and 4 (Overall): This would all be much clearer if you outlined what exactly is the meta-MDP for the meta-value function. It seems to be not episodic, is that correct?\n\n\n# Minor Comments\n- Section 2: You should explicitly state that you are studying two-player differentiable games in the first sentence for clarity.\n\n- Section 4.1 (Bellman Equation for U): It would be good to show more details how you arrived at this bellman equation as it was not immediately obvious to me (Expanding V(x + \\alpha \\nabla V(x)) and substiuting U(x) within the recurison). I also do not see why this would make any difference in learning the value function, as something similar can be done in a single agent RL setting. It is not clear what advantage the correction formulation provides."

                "value": "The paper proposes Meta-Value Learning (MeVa), a general framework for learning with learning opponent awareness in MARL. MeVa uses a meta-value method to account for longer-term behaviours of opponents and does not require policy gradients. It is consistent and far-sighted, avoiding the need to explicitly represent the continuous action space of policy updates. Many evaluations are conducted on various games, including the Logistic Game, Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Iterated Matching Pennies, and the Chicken Game, demonstrating MeVa's effectiveness in opponent shaping and cooperation for MARL. The method shows its merit in achieving cooperation where self-interest warrants it, without being exploitable by other self-interested agents."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "**Originality:**\n\nMeVa is a novel method based on meta learning for dynamic opponent modelling in MARL. Unlike previous methods, MeVa is consistent, meaning it does not assume its opponent is naive and is aware of its own learning process. MeVa is far-sighted, i.e., it looks more than one step ahead through a discounted sum formulation, which allows it to account for longer-term and higher-order interactions.\n\n**Quality:**\n\nOverall, MeVa is a high-quality method. It extends previous LOLA and other methods with value learning, which is based on value learning and does not require policy gradients anywhere. MeVa can be applied to optimization problems with a single objective.\n\n**Clarity:**\n\nOverall, the writing is good. It introduces comprehensive background and related works, which is easy for readers to follow. \n\n**Significance:**\n\nMeVa brings new insights into the MARL community, including its consistency on learning the full dynamics of the other agents, far-sightedness, value learning and implicit Q-function."
            },
            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. Scalability: The main weakness of MeVa is its scalability, particularly when learning in environments with more agents. The method may struggle to handle large parameter vectors and complex multi-agent interaction when more agents are involved.\n\n2. Writing in the methodology section: This section can be improved by using similar notations from previous works, such as LOLA, Meta-PG and Meta-MAPG. It will make it consistency in notation and easy to follow.\n\n3. Algorithm 1 is hard to follow. It would be great to add more explanations."
