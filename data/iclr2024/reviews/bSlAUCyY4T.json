Existing regularization methods typically focus on minimizing the norms of embeddings to control the model, resulting in suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, the authors introduce a novel regularization method tailored for TDB models. This regularization method can be applied to most TDB models, seamlessly integrating existing regularization techniques while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nThe core of this method involves minimizing the norms of intermediate variables used in various ways to compute the predicted tensor. To support their proposed regularization approach, the authors provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing overfitting by promoting a low trace norm of the predicted tensor."
