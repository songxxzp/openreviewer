                "value": "This paper investigates the evolution of observer uncertainty, mainly measured by covariances, in learning dynamics of two-player zero-sum games. The authors focus on the continuous-time FTRL algorithm and its two discretization schemes, Euler and symplectic discretization, which are equivalent to simultaneous and alternating GDA/MWU for certain regularizers. The authors show that for Euclidean regularizer, Euler discretization exponentially amplifies the covariance, while continuous-time FTRL and symplectic discretization amplify the covariance of cumulative strategies polynomially and keep that of cumulative payoffs bounded. As a comparison, the differential entropy of alternating MWU remains constant, which implies that covariance might be a better measurement of observer uncertainty. For general regularizers, the authors establish a Heisenberg-type inequality on variances to demonstrate the tradeoff between strategy spaces and payoff spaces."

The authors propose covariance to measure the observer uncertainty and provide evidence to show that it could be a better measurement than differential entropy.\n2. The paper establishes the connection between Euler/symplectic discretization and simultaneous/alternating algorithms through the Hamiltonian system and provides a new perspective to analyze simultaneous and alternating GDA. Moreover, the results demonstrate that the alternating algorithm is more stable than the simultaneous one.\n3. Although I do not check the details of the proofs, I believe they are correct."

                "value": "I have some doubts about the significance of this paper and there is room for improvement in the presentation.\n1. Although the authors claim that the 'input uncertainty' is well-motivated, I am still skeptical about this. For a convergent trajectory, measuring such an uncertainty could tell us (i) how fast we approach the solution; (ii) the initialization would not affect the convergence. However, for a non-convergent trajectory, measuring this uncertainty seems only to tell us whether the trajectory remains bounded or how fast it diverges. Although the results in this paper seem solid, I do not know what are the further implications for these cycling or divergent behaviors.\n\n2. Some results related to cumulative strategies lack interpretation.\nThe adaptation of cumulative payoffs is easy to understand because we could map it into the strategy space through $\\nabla h^*$. However, the adaptation of cumulative strategies seems just to facilitate the definition of the Hamiltonian system. Dividing it by $t$ yields a more intuitive meaning, i.e., the averaged strategies. Consequently, I think that the results in Theorem 5.1 could be transformed into those related to averaged strategies. Then the difference between the covariances of averaged strategies and cumulative payoffs can be better analyzed, because they represent the averaged-iterate and last-iterate behavior, respectively. In particular, I think it is also worth discussing the relationship between the results in Theorem 5.1 and the no-regret property of FTRL as well as the convergence of the averaged strategies. Finally, I do not understand the meaning of the covariance between cumulative strategies and payoffs.\n\n3. The form of symplectic discretization may be not rigorous. If we adopt the symplectic Euler method in [1, Theorem VI.3.3], the update rule of $Y^t$ in symplectic discretization (Type I method) should be $Y^{t+1} = Y^{t} - \\eta \\nabla_X H( X^t, Y^{t+1} )$, while the authors use $Y^{t+1} = Y^{t} - \\eta \\nabla_X H( X^t, Y^{t} )$. Although for the Hamiltonian function defined in Proposition 3.1, the two versions are equivalent, I think adopting the latter one may be misleading and less rigorous.\n\n4. The lower bound in Theorem 5.2 involves the covariance, while the amplification rates in Theorem 5.1 only hold for the Euclidean regularizer. For general regularizers, without the amplification rates of the covariance, the result in Theorem 5.2 itself is less meaningful.\n\nMinor concerns\n1. The authors could give more intuition on the definition of the Hamiltonian function.\n2. The dependence of $\\mu$ in Theorem 5.1 on the step size should be clarified.\n3. To capture the exponential growth, one could change the y-axis to a log scale. Similarly, to capture quadratic (or more generally, polynomial) growth rate in figures, one could change both axes to log scales.\n\n[1] Ernst Haier, Christian Lubich, and Gerhard Wanner.

                "value": "1. The results about differential entropy in Section 4 are in terms of MWU and AltMWU, while covariance evolution results in Theorem 5.1 only hold for the Euclidean regularizer, i.e., GDA and AltGDA. They are not directly comparable. However, in the appendix, the authors say that the results in Section 4 hold for more general regularizers. Why not adopt the same regularizer in the main text or state a more general result in Section 4?\n\n2. In Theorem 5.2, whether $AA^\\top$ is singular has a significant influence on the rate. Could the authors give a more intuitive explanation of this phenomenon without resorting to the matrix"
