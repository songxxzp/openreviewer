Specifically, the authors focus on two abilities of modern LLMs: (1) the ability to process information stored in the weights (fact recall) and (2) the ability to process information that is available in context. To evaluate down-scaled models on these capabilities, they use a suite of benchmarks covering four tasks, open-book QA, closed-book QA, overriding QA, and learning tasks (i.e., model needs to understand underlying function based on examples given as in-context learning). Experiments on 6 base LLMs, each with 9 different sparsity levels demonstrate different model behavior in terms of the two capabilities. Model ability to process information in weights degrades with moderate level of pruning (>30%), while model ability to process information in context does not really degrade even with aggressive pruning (up to 70%)."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "# Evaluation\nThe major weakness of the paper is the effective testing of LLM parametric and ICL knowledge.  In particular, how do the authors verify that the in-context evidence contradicts a fact present in training data?  Although LLama was trained on\npublicly available data, it is not a simple matter to verify that the answers in the Q&A datasets align or misalign with the massive dataset used to train LLamA (note that, the dataset itself was never released, so all public datasets would have to be evaluated in their entirety for verification).  In this case, it is not clear how Verifying that \"answers do not exist in the pre-training corpus\" is possible.  While the authors discuss previous work which has explored LLMs' abilities to override in-memory/parametric knowledge, such works set up measurement guardrails to do so through fine-tuning, e.g.:\n- \"DissentQA. Neeman et al. (2022) constructed the DissentQA dataset from the NaturalQuestions dataset. It contains pairs of\nquestions and evidence for a made-up answer that is different from the factual one. It assesses\nwhether the model can override its memory formed during pre-training with new context.\"\n\"Given that the anticipated made-up answers are randomized and\ndifferent from the factual ones, the model cannot depend on memorization from its pre-training\ndata to generate responses. This evaluation framework rigorously assesses the model\u2019s ability to\noverride its pre-training data with new, context-specific information.\" <- Neeman et al. (2022) fine-tune their evaluated T5 models, thus ensuring that the parameterized answers are learned and relevant questions and answers are actually counter-factual (relatedly, gold passages are considered in Longpre et al. (2021)). This work does not fine-tune the evaluated LLMs, thus relating to the earlier criticism on the validity of the presented results.\n\nFurthermore, the exact measurement of accuracy used in the paper is potentially incorrect and too conservative for recently release instruction-tuned LLMs like LLaMA and OPT.  From the text:\n- \"Answers are the model\u2019s prompt completions produced by greedy decoding. We report the\npercentage of answers that exactly match ground truth.\" <- Two important remarks: greedy is known to be extremely suboptimal for recent\ninstruction-tuned LLMs, and an exact match is not necessarily a fair metric.  Such chat models are known to be extremely wordy, so if the model produces some lead up text followed by the correct answer, this metric discounts such a correct response.  For the former, it makes sense as a fair, reproducible benchmark across different sparsity percentages per model (e.g., nucleus sampling would produce differing results between runs), please include in the text why greedy is used.  However, note that the latter is an extremely important problem which biases all related results.\n\n# Claims\nSeveral claims require revision or further discussion.  In general, wrt to key contributions, it is necessary to discuss how the presented methodology differs from previous work.  E.g., the SparseGPT paper itself reports zero-shot performance for different datasets at different sparsity levels (which effectively tests parametric knowledge), how does the presented benchmark differ from this?  Why does the presented work differ in conclusions wrt parametric knowledge compared to the SparseGPT paper, i.e., SparseGPT showed high sparsity while retraining zero-shot performance.  Why is this not the case in the presented work?  These types of questions, and their ensuing answers/justifications, require significant discussion.  More examples from the paper:\n- \"From work on image classification, however, we know that down-scaling neural networks affects more than just top-line metrics or task accuracy. Pruning, for example, can introduce biases (Hooker et al., 2019) or disproportionate affects on certain subsets of the data (Jin et al., 2022).\" <- This claim is too strong, it makes it seem as though it is a certainty that such effects occur given down-scaling.  However, a significant amount of work has shown that pruning is an effective tool for vision models.\n- \"It is difficult to assess these abilities in isolation, as a standard downstream task needs to process the\ninformation provided in context as well as access the information stored in weights.\" <- Please contrast related work which has previously explored zero-to-many shot ICL performance (across different target applications); see the following for an extensive overview:\nDong et al, \"A Survey on In-context Learning\", https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00234.pdf\n- \"Improve inference efficiency. Our work reveals that scaling down model size alone has little impact\non tasks demanding processing information in the LLM\u2019s context. Practitioners may thus use our\nfindings to identify scenarios where decisions could be routed to a smaller model instead of a larger\none without hurting task performance (Chen et al., 2023; Dohan et al., 2022).\" <- The latter work already explores how the parameter size affects performance.  In particular, the Wanda paper already tackles the question of how pruning affects ICL performance (and compares to SparseGPT)\n- \"Our work differs from prior scaling studies in two ways: while prior work (Kaplan et al., 2020b) studies\njoint scaling of both pre-training corpus size and model size, we focus on scaling model size alone.\nFurthermore, instead of measuring task performance, we focus on foundational capabilities of LLMs\u2013fact recall and ICL. These capabilities drive the success for many real world applications of LLMs\" <- This is wrong for a number of reasons.  Firstly, \"we focus on scaling model size along\" is not a valid contribution, as this would, by definition, be provided in the study of \"joint scaling of both pre-training corpus size and model size.\"  Secondly, the work of Kaplan does not study pruning, but rather LLM model size->training->resulting performance.  It is necessary to demarcate the difference between these two paradigms.\n-\"In-weight versus in-context learning\" <- Please explain how the considered work differs from Longpre et al 2022, which extensively explores In-weight versus in-context learning.\n- \"the versatility of LLMs calls for a different approach to assessing pruned models. Our work begins to fill this gap, proposing to evaluate pruning\u2019s effect on fact recall and ICL.\" <- As previously mentioned, what the authors define as fact recall is equivalent to the task of zero-shot question answering; the effect of pruning on various tasks has been explored, e.g., within the papers of the pruners specifically used within this work (SparseGPT and Wanda), as well as in the LLM-Pruner paper.  Furthermore, the effect of pruning an LLM to various sparsity levels on ICL was extensively explored in the Wanda paper.  Please revise your contributions, and position them within the context of previous works.\n-\" In all the above settings, as a simple point of comparison, we measure the effect of downscaling on perplexity\" <- Please note in the paper that this was previously considered in both the SparseGPT and Wanda papers.\n-\"  we focus on foundational capabilities of LLMs \u2013 fact recall and ICL\" <- Fact recall is zero-shot Q&A, which may be thought of as a specific task.  Please adjust this claim.\n\n# Presentation\nOverall, the writing and presentation of the discussed work could be significantly improved.  E.g.:\n- \"removing more than 30% of weights leads to significant (> 5%, relative) accuracy degradation on fact recall related tasks (Figure 1, left). Fact recall suffers similarly from dense down-scaling.\" <- Please have some text which segways from the first paragraph (page 2) to the list of 3 bold-faced items.  The intro currently reads like a collection of text/paragraphs which do not blend into one another.  E.g., combine all the bold-faced-starting paragraph in page 2 into a single paragraph, which: -States the paper shows the following dichotomy wrt pruning LLMs.  For fact recall/parametricknowldge, minimal pruning significantly degrades performance.  [insert your bold-faced-starting text here] In stark contrast, large-scale  pruning does not significantly degrade ICL performance. [insert your second bold-faced-starting text here]. [insert your third bold-faced-starting text here]\n- Same comment for italicized-starting-text, which proceed bold-starting-text; please segway the various paragraphs together.  It is very difficult for a reader to understand the point that is trying to be made when sentences exist independently."
