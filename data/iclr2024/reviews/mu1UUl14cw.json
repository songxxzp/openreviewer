Since both scene generator and controlnet are trained on Structure3D dataset, which contains only \"living room\" and \"bedroom\", I am concerned the variety of scenes this method could generate. I am also curious about how does it work on some other rooms, like \"bathroom\", \"kitchen\" and others?\n2. Text prompts are strange.  The text prompts shown in this paper are not very natural. For example, \" the living room has eight walls,. The room has a picture, a shelves and a cabinet\".  These prompts are very different from prompts people typically use to describe the rooms. I am curious about how it works with  more natural and rand descriptions? Like \"a living room with a cozy, yellow coach and red curtain\" and others. \n3. Related to point 2,  the given prompts specifies the number of walls in the room. Is it necessary to specify the wall numbers to get good results? What is the quality of scene generation? Are the number of walls generated the same as number in text prompts? Counting the number of wall instances in generated layout and comparing to numbers in text prompts might be an  interesting metric to look on. \n4. Not a weakness but some citations are missing:\n[1] CC3D: Layout-Conditioned Generation of Compositional 3D Scenes\n[2] RoomDreamer: Text-Driven 3D Indoor Scene Synthesis with Coherent Geometry and Texture"

It doesn't support multi-viewpoint generation, which limits the visual quality when the viewpoint is freely moved.\n\n(-) The results for the layout generation stage lack sufficient evaluation and comparison, making it challenging to assess the effectiveness of the first stage in isolation."
