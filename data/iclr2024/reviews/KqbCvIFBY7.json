If mode collapse is not a leading factor in most cases, it might affect the significance of this study. When the number of modes far exceeds the number of samples, it's evident that iid sampling and sampling with repulsion are similar, which seems to be the case for most data. For instance, in Figure 4 (a), diversity does not appear to be a severe issue. The main problem in Figure 4 (d) seems to be overfitting to the training data (an artificial setting). I think the authors should emphasize scenarios where the number of samples is close to the number of modes to highlight the setting's effectiveness. Molecular conformer might be an example, but since I am not an expert in that area, the authors could further explain.\n\nThe paper's theoretical foundation is weak and does not directly explain why particle guidance can increase diversity.\n\n\n[1] A Study on Sample Diversity in Generative Models: GANs vs. Diffusion Models"

Can the authors comment on this point? \n\n- Another missing discussion is on the choice of $n$, the number of particles used in practice. How does one determine $N$, and what is its implication on the joint distribution? For example, I hypothesize that for $n_1>n_2$, marginalizing out the last $n1-n2$ particles in the joint distribution of $n1$ does not recover the joint distribution of $n_2$. And when $n$ is much larger than the number of modes in the diffusion model that we are interested in, what would happen by running the proposed method (especially when using a large guidance weight). Would that result in generating particles that have very low density under the diffusion model?\n\n- This point is regarding clarify. Similar to the above \"marginalization\" argument, I think there is a missing discussion on whether such joint sampling of $x_1, \\cdots, x_n$ would recover marginally exact samples from a diffusion model, and I assume not (correct me if I'm wrong).

It seems like the authors were referring this property to getting to every \"mode\" of the distribution in finite steps. If this is the case, I wonder the authors can be more clear about this point, and provide evidence or reference to support this claim?\n\n3. Can you further explain why \"Hence the density p0\u02c6 can be understood as a reweighting of the random variable Z\" (the sentence under equation 5 on page 4)?
