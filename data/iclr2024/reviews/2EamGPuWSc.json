This method is based on \"a global formulation of physics-informed losses\". It appears that, with this new formulation of empirical loss, this method can avoid higher-order auto-differentiation for initial value problems (ODE) and some PDEs. Also, the new method does not require a separate effort to handle the boundary value conditions by merging the boundary value conditions into the formulation of the empirical loss. It is also worth noting that this new formulation is not limited to quantum neural networks, but is also applicable to ordinary neural networks (empirical results are given in the appendices).\n\nBeyond theoretical formulation, numerical simulation has been performed to solve three ODE models, namely, population extinction, population growth, and a seasonal environment. In each model, the problem is to solve a scalar function $y(t)$ governed by an ODE with initial conditions. The quantum circuit uses 3 qubits. The circuit design (i.e., feature map, hardware-efficient ansatz) almost completely follows Kyriienko et al. (2021). The function $y(t)$ is computed by measuring the first qubit with a Pauli operator (see Fig 2). The authors report the advantage of their method (*propagated*) compared to *qPINN*, especially when the number of shots is finite."

(5) and (6)). It is argued that the computational complexity of the evaluation of the line integrals is $O(NL)$, where $L$ is the number of line elements, and $N$ is the number of quadrature points on each line. Using the new loss function with quantum neural networks, there is an $O(N)$ reduction in the number of shots per training step."

In Equation (3), the authors introduce a symbol $\\mathcal{N}_B$ without any prior definition. This symbol seems to be equivalent to $\\mathcal{B}$ in Equation (1). However, the authors assume that $\\mathcal{N}_B$ is invertible (in Section 2.3.1), which is a bit problematic. The inverse of differential operators such as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$ (in \"Dirichlet Boundary Conditions\") and $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ (in \"Neumann Boundary Conditions\") appear to be singular operators without a well-defined inverse. \n\n2. In the quantum loss function $\\langle \\emptyset |U^\\dagger_t U^\\dagger_\\theta H U_\\theta U_t|\\emptyset\\rangle$, the authors use $\\emptyset$ to denote the initial state, which is very confusing. Also, it would be much clearer if more explanations on how to use this ansatz to estimate the formulated loss function (Eq. (8)) were provided. \n\n3. The authors use the term \"finite and infinite shot limits\" several times. I can understand the \"infinite shot limit\", which means the perfect expectation value of the measurement quantum observable. But I am not sure what is the \"finite shot limit\". Mathematically, a *limit* is defined as the value that a function (or sequence) approaches as the input (or index) approaches some value. When the number of shots is finite, I do not think the measurement result converges. Therefore, I do not understand what is a \"finite limit\" in the context of this paper."

The numerical examples are very simple scalar ODEs that do not require advanced techniques such as NNs to solve. The motivation for introducing physics-informed NN in numerical analysis is to deal with the \"curse of dimensionality\", as the traditional methods have bad scaling in terms of the problem dimension (especially for PDEs). However, I do not see why quantum could help this situation (and even do better than classical NN). As the author mentioned in the manuscript, QNN suffers from expensive (higher-order) gradient estimation and does not allow a perfect evaluation of the loss (which would require \"an infinite amount of shots\"). Classical NN does not have these issues. Also, the tables given in Appendix A.3 show that QNN does not outperform classical NN."
