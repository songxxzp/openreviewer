However, in my opinion, the date generation process in this work is not more realistic for the following reasons:\n\n1. Firstly, it\u2019s a gaussian model, so it\u2019s very different from the discrete case of NLP. Because it\u2019s not discrete, it is even less realistic than the HMM model used by Xie et al.\n2. Secondly, this work assumes that the generation process of the pretraining data is the same as the downstream task. Again, this is worse than Xie et al., because Xie et al. discuss the distribution mismatch problem between pretraining and downstream tasks at least to some extent.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s not clear to me what the main takeaway of this paper is. Indeed, the authors derive the error bounds for the two kinds of downstream tasks, however\n\n1. It\u2019s not clear to me how the definition of the two kinds of tasks is relevant in the real-world scenario.\n2. Empirically, we do not observe that having more examples hurt the performance.\n3. And again, it\u2019s not clear how the generation process is related to the real-world data."
