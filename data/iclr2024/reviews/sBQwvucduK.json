Geometry encompasses more than just pose and Box3D; it also includes shape, topology, and the ability to modify any object within the scene.\n2. The consistency aspect of the results is not fully realized. While I acknowledge that the multi-camera consistency is superior to that of the baselines, the broader aspect of consistency, such as consistency from novel viewpoints (e.g., moving cameras away from the original view, rotating it 360 degrees, modifying the focal length to zoom into details in distant regions), seems to be lacking. Based on my observations from the website and deductions from the approach, achieving such consistency with the current representation seems highly unlikely.\n3. The novelty of this work is unclear to me, as I am not very familiar with this topic. Upon a quick review of BEVGen and BEVControl, it appears that the main difference lies in the new modeling of 3D bounding boxes (in this work, the authors decouple the 3D boxes and road maps and model them separately), the use of Stable Diffusion, and cross-view attention. However, none of these elements seem to be significantly innovative."

For this purpose, the authors introduce various cross attention over their conditions to fuse their conditions onto scene representation (they also feed non-scene related condition directly to stable diffusion). The training follows ControlNet paradigm with classifier-free guidance to encourage output more aligned with conditions. Result-wise, they compare with BEVGen and BEVControl on nuScenes.
