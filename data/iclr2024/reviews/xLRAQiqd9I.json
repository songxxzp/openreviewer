Is cutoff of interatomic distances applied when implementing attention between atoms in GeMFormer? If yes, how is the cutoff determined?\n3. The work has included benchmarks on multiple standard molecular property prediction tasks. How does the model perform on QM9. Though it's a bit older compared with some benchmarks, it's still a widely used. It would be helpful to see where GeMFormer sits on QM9 as well. \n4. In appendix D.7, the authors present ablation studies on N-body simulation task. However, as the work focuses mostly on molecular property predictions. It would be better to include some ablations on molecular benchmarks to further validation the design choices."

This enables the comprehensive modeling of interatomic interactions, both within individual feature spaces and across them, in a unified and simultaneous fashion.\n\n\nThe proposed architecture is general. Many established methods can be seen as specific instances within our framework. For instance, PaiNN (Sch\u00fctt et al., 2021) and TorchMD-NET (Th\u00f6lke & De Fabritiis, 2022) can be configured as distinct realizations by adhering to the design principles of GeoMFormer and selecting appropriate configurations for essential building components.\n\n\n\nThe experimental results are thorough, including invariant and equivariant tasks, covering multiple mainstream tasks in the molecule modeling.
