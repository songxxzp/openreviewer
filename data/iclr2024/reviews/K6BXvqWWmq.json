The paper heavily leans on the MOPO framework, both in terms of its structural framework and its theoretical underpinnings. A more comprehensive rationale for the selection of MOPO over other comparable alternatives is necessary.\n\n4. The main method of the paper does not show a clear increase in performance compared to MOPO.  Also, the paper limits experimental evaluation to a single kind of offline dataset.
