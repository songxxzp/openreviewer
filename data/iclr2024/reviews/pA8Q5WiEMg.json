(2021) and widely improve the results, deriving regret bounds with improved dependencies on the number of tasks $T$ and the number of episodes within each task $m$. This algorithm is easy to implement and experiments can be found in the appendix that highlight that transferring information helps. \n\nThey then propose a different more general approach, which only requires the assumption of bounded loss functions. They derive regret bounds that are tighter than for the first algorithm, and are even sharper than the bounds derived by Khodak et al. (2019). While the theoretical results hold, it is also indicated in the appendix that they cannot manage to implement the algorithm, which limits the practical interest of this algorithm to specific and easy to implement problem instances.\n\nFinally, they also provide generalization bounds for statisitical meta-learning and PAC-Bayesian bounds for statistical multi-task learning."

The correlation among tasks is assumed to be helpful for learning the latter tasks. This paper provides a sub-linear regret w.r.t. the number of iterations $m$, and the regret exhibit a better convergence rate w.r.t. the number of tasks $T$. The authors investigate both non-convex piecewise Lipschitz continuous functions and non-Lipschitz functions in section 4.1 and 4.2, which makes the contribution fruitful. The proposed algorithm uses FT(R)L to update distribution $\\rho_i$ in two different settings, which is motivated by previous work. The improvement comes from the learning initialization step and the choice of step size.\n\nThe authors are quite honest to discuss the limitation in Remark~B.1 of Appendix~B and Remark~H.1. Thus, there is no need to further discuss these issues in my comments. \n\nI strongly recommend the authors to complement more details and explanations in the proof to make it more readable. For instance, I was quite confused on the third equation in the proof of Proposition~F.1., where the explanation that $\\ell_i'$ ``is the i.i.d. copy...'' is not enough to show the equivalence, the boundedness of $\\ell_i$ is also required. I cannot fully understand $\\{\\ell\\}_{j=1}^{i-1}\\sim \\mu^{i-1}$, $j=0$ and $\\mu^{i-1}$ are not defined. The issues like that are common in proofs. I have to admit that I was convincing myself some (in)-equalities are correct since the authors are honest to admit their issues. Due to the time limit, I can only proof check some part of the proofs. I hope other reviewers and the authors could help checking the theoretical part in the future."

However some issues (which are acknowledged and discussed in the appendix) lead to concerns about the significance of the results for this problem.  \n- It is noted in the appendix (Remark B.1, which is referenced at the end of Section 4) that due to the initialization update rule of the FTL algorithm, the regret bound in Theorem 3 may be vacuous under the regret definition in Eq (1) when the task optimal distribution $\\rho_t^*$ is a Dirac measure.    It is mentioned in Remark B.1 that alternative update rules of $\\rho_{t1}$ may address the issue but (i) are there candidates in mind and (ii) how badly might they impact the regret bound?  i.e. is it plausible that an analog to Proposition 4 could be found that would still yield the same or almost the same good task-averaged upper-regret bound as Theorem 3?\n- It is also noted in the appendix (Remark H.1, which I don\u2019t think was referenced in Section 4) that the analytic form of the RN derivatives can\u2019t be computed in practice even for uniform or Gaussian distributions.

It seems for OWO meta-learning the comparator sequence would be fixed for each task and the changes would be known a priori (every $m$ rounds).  Perhaps there would be a significant gap between regret bounds from online optimization with dynamic comparators specialized to OWO (eg accounting for task similarities etc) versus regret bounds for methods designed specially for OWO.\n\n### Minor comments/questions\n2.
