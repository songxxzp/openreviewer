In detail, the authors split the original classification task into several complementary subtasks. When we focuses on one subtask, data from the other subtasks can be considered as ood data. Then the training scheme can take both id and ood task into consideration. In addition, the authors propose a tree-like Split-Ensemble architecture that splits and prunes the networks  based on one shared backbone to extract low level features. To verify the proposed method, the authors conduct experiments on several image classification datasets such as CIFAR10 CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet. The classification results on id data has an enhancement in terms of classification accuracy. According to the ood detection criterion, the ood detection ability seems to improve significantly."

For the splitting and pruning process, the authors propose a novel splitting criterion and utilize global pruning to reduce the model size. To verify the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted. For the proposed ood setting, the enhancement of the proposed method is very significant. Further analysis of the task splitting is also present."
