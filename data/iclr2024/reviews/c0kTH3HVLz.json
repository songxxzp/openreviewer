They propose a recurrent-based reconstruction framework that utilizes a light-robust representation (LR-Rep) to aggregate temporal information in spike streams. Additionally, a fusion module is used to extract temporal features. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of their approach. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of low-light spike streams and discuss the efficiency and stability of their method."

How much the training takes for the memory and time?\n\n------------------\nRelated to display or Minor comments:\n\n- Figure 1 Middle(b) is quite confusing. Does the temporal features for both blue and purple are same? If it is different, it should be illustrated differently. Also, the color difference blue and purple are too small, and also it does not looks as purple. Please make it more distinctive. Also, blue and purple arrows seems not an arrows, but justlines, so please improve it for better clarity. Same for the Fig. 3.\n- Explanation of LISI transform is in the caption, not in the section. In section 4.3, GISI and LISI suddenly appears, which make readers bit confused. If these are also one of the new blocks proposed, they should be described well.\n- In Figure 4, example image of GISI does not show anything. While the figure can be illustrative, suggest authors to use better image that can get the clue what the GISI output looks like.\n- In Figure 5, notation is confusing. For example, if the (a) LISI ti=21 mean the LISI output at ti equals 21, \"=21\" need to be subscript along with ti. Currently it is $LISI_{ti} = 21$. Also suggest to use Latex outputs in the figures for math expressions.  \n- In Figure 9, maybe the dynamic range are uniform for all reconstructions. The STP shows extremely different range, which makes other reconstruction methods totally not visible. (I expect STP images are totally saturated if we use dynamic range of other images.) How about using two different dynamic ranges, one only for STP and the other for other images. It would be okay with descriptions and specifying the min-max values. Anyway, currently the contrast is too low for reconstructed images. \n- In the last line of page 4, typo \"camrea\"."

It is very unclear how low is the \"low light\" used in this paper. And it's also not touched how robust the algorithm functions comparing normal and low light. A better version is a quantification for performance vs light intensity.\n\n- Second, as light decreases, the solution of this paper is to extract information from longer time range. In such a case, motion may play a significant role affecting the reconstruction results. Yet it was not demonstrated.\n\nIt looks like the LLR dataset has only two lighting conditions, i.e. normal and low? Is it enough for benchmarking? Are 5 motions enough? The paper mentioned \"... the power of light source is consistent with the real world\". How to achieve consistency? The dataset part lacked technical details and justification.\n\nThe overall idea is interesting but lacks significance. The bidirectional attentive approach has been well seen in video frame interpolation and event-based version.\nThe global inter-spike interval (GISI) is a small extension of previous LISI. It is also very confusing what LISI is referring to. The two references [Chen 2022] proposed TFI and [Zhao 2022b] proposed DSFT (differential of spike firing). Are the authors referring to TFI and DSFT as the same thing? And according to Table 2 the significance of GISI is so marginal and is hardly considered a contribution. \n\nThe figures are well-made but they hardly explained technical details. Figure 5 generated a lot of confusion as what's \"LISI\", \"update\" and \"maintain\". Mathematical formulation is needed. Figure 7 did not provide useful information and is quite redundant to present after Eq 5-9.\n\nPlease work on the presentation as there are a lot of grammar errors."
