The capability of the proposed method to effectively operate within a data-free setup is both intriguing and commendable.\n\n\n\nI am genuinely intrigued by the concept of split-data training introduced in the paper. Its novelty, practicality, and engaging nature hold great potential to inspire and contribute significantly to the broader community.\n\n\nThe proposed method skillfully utilizes a modified version of OTFusion to integrate the discarded neurons into the \"surviving\" ones, a strategy I find to be quite thoughtful and well-reasoned.\n\n\nA significant portion of the research in structured pruning has concentrated on creating more significant importance measures, denoted as i, while the overarching procedure outlined in Algorithm 1 has largely stayed consistent. Drawing inspiration from OTFusion, this paper endeavors to explore an innovative approach to the conventional pruning method. Rather than merely eliminating the less crucial pairings within a group, the authors thoughtfully utilize the calculated importance metrics to guide the fusion of these pairings, ultimately resulting in a reduced group cardinality. This nuanced method demonstrates a commendable attempt to enhance the efficiency of structured pruning.\n\nThe results showcased by the proposed method, particularly within the data-free setup, are indeed promising and show great potential. This outcome is both encouraging and exciting, and it highlights the method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios.\n\n\nThe results presented in Figure 6 appear to be promising and demonstrate the potential effectiveness of the approach being discussed."

This approach, irrespective of the specific neuron-importance metric used, can prune a significant number of parameters while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to standard pruning methods.

It is highly advisable to add a set of comparisons with ResNet50 on ImageNet (as far as I know, this is the standard benchmark setup in a typical pruning paper).\n\n1.2 Based on Tab. 1, after finetuning, the advantage of the proposed method seems quite marginal (the authors also agree that \"*the gains might not seem as stark*\"). Although the authors argue that \"the focus of this paper is on data-free pruning\", I do not think this is strong enough to justify the weak improvement, since  \"data-free pruning\" is barely practical at present. This means, when used in practice, the proposed method actually will not see much advantage against the default pruning scheme.\n\n2.
