If it doesn\u2019t scale, Stable Alignment is significantly less promising as an alignment method. (It\u2019s still interesting as an LLM capabilities analysis though.)\n2. I\u2019m not entirely convinced how important is the social aspect of the data-generating process. It seems to be just an extension of [language model cascades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10342) line of work, including [imitational learning from language feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16755) (ILF) or [constitutional AI](https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback) (CAI), where LMs give feedback on LMs\u2019 initial responses which are then refined. The agents are weakly individuated in the proposes framework, i.e. (as far as I understand) they start the same and and only differ in their conversation histories. I wonder how important is treating multiple calls to the same LM as simulating different agents. Does it improve alignment compared with a single-agent society, more similar to ILF or CAI? Is there a scaling plot? (I might\u2019ve missed this, I\u2019m happy to corrected by the authors.)\n3.

The other agents provide feedback and ratings to the answers generated by the central agent, and those data are later used for training. Next, the author proposes Stable Alignment, which trains a LM to learn from those collected data in three stages by 1) imitation learning from socially aligned responses, 2) learning to self-critique, and 3) learning to generate better responses entailed by a feedback. Additionally, stage 1 and stage 3 are trained using a contrastive objective. The authors finally showed improved performance (e.g. generating more human-aligned responses, choosing more moral responses) in a variety of tasks, and presents analysis showing that Stable Alignment has a more stable training curve compared to RRHF and requires less training steps to obtain high rewards/scores."

There is a lack of analysis or discussion on the noises that could come from gathering data from LLMs, which is arguably critical for the proposed method to succeed and can be seen as limitation of how far this approach can go.\n\n2. the sandbox data creation procedure appears to be an extension to prompt *multiple* LLM agents to provide rating and feedback for a single agent, instead of just prompting a single LLM teacher to gather data. There is a lack of experiments showing the advantage of using \"multiple\" LLM agents, and whether if this is even necessary. If not, many relevant work ([1]-[3]), which also did learning to generate feedback/critiques/improvement from a single teacher model, and is not discussed in this work.

The benefit of this is a more stable learning curve (from supervised training), but to what extent do you see this trade-off between on/off-policy training coming up in your proposed approach?\n\n2. why is TRLX not included in Figure 4?\n\u00a0\n3. the motivation of sandbox being a \"10 x 10\" grid is unclear. Since the interaction mechanism is getting feedback and ratings from some other LLM agents, just sampling those LLMs from some unordered pool should suffice? It is unclear how the additional structure of a grid world is necessary in the proposed sandbox environment.\n\n4. the data collection process of using LLM to gather feedback and asking the central model to generate a revision may be error-prone as indicated by [2] and [4], as a smaller LMs such as LLaMA-7b or Alpaca was not trained initially to follow the feedback and revise its response.

The general concept of being inspired by social interactions is interesting, and there is the possibility of being able to train an aligned model without the need to host an online reward model. However, there are many details in the execution that cast doubt on the learning method\u2019s efficacy. Additionally, the claim of simulating human society with no supporting references from the social science literature is too grandiose.\n\n\n2. There are extensive experiments on multiple datasets.\n\n\n3. Human annotators were used for evaluating the final output rather than simply using a language model as a shortcut."

                "value": "1. > However, this method often yields models susceptible to adversarial attacks, like \u201cjailbreaking prompting\u201d (Subhash, 2023; Xu et al., 2021), due to limited exposure to misaligned data during training (Amodei et al., 2016). To address this, a more advanced technique, \u201creward modeling\u201d has been proposed (Leike et al., 2018; Christiano et al., 2017). \n\nSubhash, 2023 uses ChatGPT, a model that has likely been trained with a reward model, as an example of a vulnerable model and appears to contradict the second sentence stating that reward modeling addresses the vulnerabilities of SFT-trained models. \n\n2. The claim of simulating human society with no supporting references from the social science literature is way too grandiose. The authors should improve the accuracy of their claim.\n\n3. It is somewhat unclear how the OpenAI models fit into the picture; are 99 of the 100 models all simply one of the 3 OpenAI models and one of them the Stable Alignment model? If so, this seems like a form of distillation of the preferences/values from the OpenAI model, which was purportedly trained with SFT and RLHF. Given that this method claims to do away with the need for RLHF/RMs, experiments showing its efficacy should not rely on models trained with such methods. In other words, the current experiments do not convince me that Stable Alignment can replace RLHF on its own. For example, I would be much more convinced if all the agents were initialized from non-RM based models. Relatedly, while convenient, using the OpenAI API models for critical parts of the experiments makes them essentially non-replicable and rather non-reproducible, given the constantly changing model in the backend. \n\n4. An additional nitpick is that the method claims to deviate from SFT-like approaches but uses an SFT-trained model as the starting point. I would like to see this addressed as well; what is the performance of Stable Alignment without using an SFT-trained model as the initialization?\n\n5. Regarding CPO, since it is a new technique that claims to improve the efficacy of the overall method, there should be an ablation where it is replaced with the regular SFT loss or other alignment algorithms, such as perhaps DPO.\n\n6. More details on the procedure and exactly which models and types of social agents were used to generate data for each learning stage are needed; this is still unclear to me after reading through the details and appendices multiple times. Are the numbers of examples for each stage in Fig 2 the total over all iterations, or per iteration? How many iterations were needed to arrive at the final model? Was the model trained on data from all three societies at each stage or were 3 separate models trained? If the latter, which model was used in the final evaluation?\n\n7. Use of HH-A as an estimate of adversarial prompt robustness:\nI went through the examples in the HHH dataset (there are typos where the last H is missing throughout the paper) and disagree with the use of the appended \u201cmisaligned\u201d response as a dataset good enough for adversarial robustness evaluation. A better evaluation of adversarial prompt robustness would be to use a library such as [garak](https://github.com/leondz/garak) with known adversarial prompts used by the community."

                "value": "1. Given that the motivation was alignment to social values, how was diversity across demographics ensured in the user study? The user study is meant to demonstrate that models trained with this method are better aligned, but better aligned to whom? This is important to call out since regular practitioners will simply use the popular models of the day with the released toolkit without thinking critically about whose values they capture.\n\n1. Additionally, given the use of simulation with LMs is touted as a benefit of this approach, what are the drawbacks of using this instead of collecting representative feedback (and training a reward model), whose values are the models implicitly aligning to with such simulation? These should be explicitly called out and elaborated in the limitations section but are currently briefly glossed over in the ethics section.\n\n1. Given the unstable nature of RL training, how was hyperparameter optimization done for the baseline methods? Were you able to reproduce published results where their hyperparameters were optimized?\n\n1. For the embedding model and social agents, is it necessary to use an API model? Why not use an open-source model, which makes the experiments more reproducible and replicable?"
