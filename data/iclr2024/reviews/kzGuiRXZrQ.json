While there isn't a significant technical innovation, the model does exhibit enhanced empirical performance based on the provided metrics. The primary focus of the model is the unconditional semi de novo generation of 3D molecular structures. Notably, the relevance of generating valence-correct molecular structures without specific conditions is not clear. The authors highlight potential applications in structure-based drug design, yet the model's current format doesn't seem optimized for this purpose. Additionally, there is no mention of code availability. The presentation and writing of the article require improvement. In its current state, the manuscript lacks a meaningful technical contribution and seems to address an ill-defined task. I suggest that the authors refine their model for structure-based drug design and consider resubmitting for a future conference."

In section 6, the authors use OMEGA to generate ground truth. However, the conformers from OMEGA may be inaccurate. Did the authors consider pretrain on DFT datasets like PCQM4Mv2 (>3M data)? Though it's much smaller than PubChem3D, the model may benefit from higher data quality. \n3. Following the previous question, Fig. 2 shows that with sufficient training data, the advantage of pretrained model is trivial. In fact, in some metrics, the pretrained model is doing slightly worse than training from scratch. What could be the reason? Could it be related to OMEGA generated pretraining data?\n4. One question about the big scope of this work is what the benefits of direct de novo 3D molecule generative model vs. two-stage model where first generate SMILES/graphs and then predict the conformers? I can see the advantages for structure-conditioned molecule design. However, this paper mostly investigate unconditional 3D molecule generation. \n5. Torsional diffusion (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01729) introduces a GEOM-XL dataset including large molecules (>100 atoms). It may also be interesting to see how the proposed method transfer to such OOD datasets."

The authors didn't discuss or try to draw ideas from recent efforts in generative diffusion models for images or for protein structure prediction that may have strong analogies and lessons to the study of small molecules as well.\n\nThe fonts in all the figure labels are unreadably (unpublishably?) small. If space is the main concern, then there certainly exist small chunks of text (e.g. the last paragraph of section 4) and some figure panels (e.g. most from Fig 2) that could move to the supplement, and some parts that could be rewritten concisely (e.g. intro to sec 5, which could also be clarified as it was not clear what \"these three aspects\" meant in paragraph 2, top of page 5).\n\n\nThe dataset is a weakness for this paper and most other papers in this area.  I disagree with the premise of the authors that the availability of molecular data is not as abundant, though I agree that the community has been stuck on trivial and no longer meaningful datasets (it feels similar to ML in vision prior to imagenet). The authors mention the catalogue of Enamine Real in the supplement which scales to the 10s of billions of molecular graphs (albeit limited in complexity, but there are also computational enumerations of valid molecules that can be much bigger), the published patent literature probably scales to the multiple 10s of millions.  QM methods of relatively reasonable accuracy exist that are not exceedingly expensive and datasets of 10s of millions of published 3D structures with simpler methods also exist."

The authors seem to not address the possible distribution shifts due to chiral transformations.\n\nSmall molecules with 3D coordinates often have specific chirality.  Although this chirality is specified in the full set of 3D positions, the authors model is using E3 symmetries in its core so I wonder if it will mix chiral molecule in ways that would result in a distribution shift.  Have the authors checked the chirality of the generated molecular distributions by keeping say only one kind of stereo isomer and validating that their model would construct both? Would implementing the SE3 group allow the authors to also including chiral flags on the bonds, in the way that shown in the typical 2D representations of molecular graphs?\n\nIt was not clear to me why the inclusion of the eps-parameterization does not use a composite loss as did the x0-parameterization.  Is it not a priori clear a priori that the addition of a categorical loss for categorical data will outperform a mean squared error on categorical data?  I may be misunderstanding something simple here, so perhaps you can explain here and possibly reformulate the early parts of section 5.\n\nThe lack of the reproduction of the MiDi code benchmarks that the authors report in the supplement is interesting, though it probably would not change the results in the paper in a qualitative way.  Did the authors contact the authors of MiDi to resolve this issue and did they receive any feedback on that question? \n\nThe observation by the authors regarding deteriorating performance upon pretraining on explicit hydrogen on a larger molecular set is an interesting point that gets buried in the supplement. Is there a generalizable lesson and perhaps a better/different way to overcome this problem than dropping the hydrogens, or is this observation too close to the level of noise?"
