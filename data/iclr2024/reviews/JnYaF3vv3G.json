[Regarding the subtlety of privacy analysis of SELFSPAN]. If I understand it correctly, the problem is that even though the additional projection step does not touch sensitive data (labels) in this case, one cannot directly use post-processing. This is because the projection will leak the index of the sampling result, which then impacts the privacy amplification by subsampling in the original DP-SGD. Due to this, when using SELFSPAN, one cannot enjoy the gain/benefit of subsampling. On the other hand, since it does not touch labels, one can still use post-processing over the **non-subsampling** version of DP-SGD?\n\n2. [Regarding the improvement over DP-SGD] It seems to me that the main gain over DP-SGD is the improvement over dimension d? It might be better to give more discussions on Table 4, as there are different choices of \\sigma. Being more specific or using more particular values will be better I think. \n\n3. [Confusion about the section name] For Section 4, the authors use SCO, which gives readers the impression that the goal is somehow the population excess loss. However, it turns out the authors are actually analyzing ERM. It might be better to replace the section name."

                "value": "Both the proposed method and baseline numbers in the experiment can be potentially better. As they might be underestimated, the current comparison could be inaccurate, which is the main evaluation to illustrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.\n- The pure DP-SGD can be much better, which can potentially bring benefits for the proposed algorithm. For example, De et al., 2022 empirically show that DP-SGD can achieve 56.8% accuracy on CIFAR10 when $\\varepsilon=1.0$, while the number reported in the paper is only 43.5%.\n- ALIBI's accuracy on CIFAR-10 is reported as 51.3 when $\\varepsilon=1.0$ in Table 5 in the paper, while in the original paper (Malek et al. (2021)) ALIBI achieves 71% when $\\varepsilon=1.0$.\n- When leveraging self-supervised learning with LabelDP, PATE-FM doesn't utilize the SelfSL on CIFAR-10, which seems a little unfair. It is reasonable to at least utilize a pretrained feature extractor as an initialization instead of random initialization when training teachers in PATE-FM. In this way, PATE-FM leveraging SelfSL is expected to have better accuracy.\n\nMoreover, DP-SGD with gradient projection actually has been investigated for a while [1, 2] and not introduced in the paper. Although I still agree with the novelty of the proposed method given that all previous labelDP algorithms are based on label flipping, it might be worthwhile to see the difference and comparison between the proposed method and the methods in the literature.\n\n[1] Yu, Da, et al. \"Do not Let Privacy Overbill Utility: Gradient Embedding Perturbation for Private Learning.\" International Conference on Learning Representations. 2020.\n\n[2] Kairouz, Peter, et al. \"Fast dimension independent private adagrad on publicly estimated subspaces.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2008.06570 (2020)."
