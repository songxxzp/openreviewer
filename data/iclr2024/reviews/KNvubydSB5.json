HiGen generates a graph in a coarse-to-fine manner, wherein a small, \"low-resolution\" graph is generated, and at the next, higher-resolution level, each node at the prior level corresponds to the graph of a community of nodes, whereas each edge corresponds to a bipartite graph between two communities. The concept of this method promises greater scalability, parallelization, and graph quality than prior methods. Experiments on generating several classes of graphs, such as SBMs, proteins, enzymes, ego networks, and point clouds, indicate overall superiority of the quality of graphs produced by HiGen relative to some prior methods."

However, there are many degrees of freedom in measuring the quality of graph generation, so it is hard to tell whether there is real progress. With this in mind, how would the authors argue that there is a real advancement in the graph quality of HiGen? As I mentioned above, a theoretical framework is one possibility, but this paper goes in a more empirical direction."
