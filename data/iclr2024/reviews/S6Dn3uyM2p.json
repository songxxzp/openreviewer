As motivated in the introduction, hashing is frequently for the purpose of approximately calculating the similarity between two high-dimensional binary vectors. The paper also mentions the bias and variance of non-private estimators of the Jaccard similarity. However, except in Section A of the Appendix, there is not much mention of how the estimation accuracy, using the proposed hashing methods, depends on the privacy parameters, dimension of data, number of bins, etc. The discussion in Section A is also limited in two ways: (1) the variance analysis is only empirical; (2) it only considers replacing the non-private hash values in a specific estimator defined in equation (2) by private hash values, while there is no clear justification given for why this particular estimator is still the best candidate for private estimation of Jaccard similarity. Some utility analysis can be very useful for assessing the proposed algorithms in their own right, or relative to existing methods. For example, one advantage of this paper's set up, as suggested at the end of Section 1.2, is that it makes no assumptions about whether hash functions are kept private. However, without understanding the cost of this generality, potential users may still have difficulty in choosing between competing methods of DP hashing.\n\n* Some gap in motivating One Permutation Hashing and b-bit coding. The paper mainly studies One Permutation Hashing with hash values restricted to b-bit integers, but the justifications for these choices appear somewhat ambiguous, especially to readers without much background in this topic. For example, it would be helpful if the last sentence of the first paragraph in Section 3.1 can include some more details (why unstable? violating the triangle inequality with respect to which metric?). For another example, restricting hash values to b-bit integers appears to be crucial to the DP algorithms (otherwise, the randomized response mechanism may not apply), however the paragraph on b-bit coding on page 3 feels rushed and leaves out some important details (without considering privacy yet, is there any accuracy loss by restricting to b-bits? How is b usually chosen? Is b-bit coding convenient, or rather, necessary for DP hashing?)"

The evaluation of Section 4 shows that estimations are accurate for only very large values of $\\epsilon$ (i.e. between 10 and 50) and therefore a large privacy loss. A partial exception is DP-OPH-rand, which shows fairly better accuracy already when $\\epsilon$ reaches 5. However, I its behavior is not clear since plots focus on a larger scale and we cannot see in detail what is happening in the range [0.1, 10].  \n\n2- Novelty: I do not find substantial novelty in the work. The application of randomized response to MH sketches is already present in Aum\u00fcller et al. (2020). It is true that the authors found a mistake on the proof of this related work and corrected it, but as said in the paper, this mistake is minor. It seems that the application of these ideas to the proposed OPH variations do not have substantial changes. If the authors could clearly explain the novelty in the content of their proofs with respect to Aum\u00fcller et al. (2020), I will take this point back and re-asses my score. \n\n3- Clarity: Even if I think the paper is overall well presented, it still requires more clarity in the technical sections. \n\n3a- The degree of \"locality\" of the DP guarantee could be more clearly explained. In the contribution, there is no need to trust a central party to take two vectors and output a noisy estimation of its Jaccard distance as it would be needed in central DP. Clarifying this aspect would also help to better motivate the scope of application of the result. \n\n3b- The results presented in Section 3.2 of the paper are not always self contained and could be better presented."

I briefly checked two previous papers on this topic and really appreciate it if the authors help me understand why the analysis of utility is not available in this work. In [2], it is claimed that One Permutation Hashing outperforms Minwise Hashing, and the theoretical analysis includes two lemma on page 5: Lemma 1 says the expected number of 'jointly empty bins' has an upper bound; Lemma 2 says the estimator of the resemblance is unbiased. Would you please explain intuitively how these two analysis show the better utility?\n4. To continue, in [1], where there is a small error of probability distribution fixed in this paper, the authors gave utility analysis. Looking at lemma 5 and theorem 2 on page 6 (arxiv version), the upper bound of additive error seems to be $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\varepsilon}})$ by taking $\\alpha =1, \\tau = n$ if I did not misunderstand. Why cannot we do a similar analysis on the algorithms proposed here?\n\nMinor: Maybe explicitly state the randomized response mechanism in the preliminary.\n\n[1] Differentially Private Sketches for Jaccard Similarity Estimation.\n[2] One Permutation Hashing"

                "value": "This paper considers making a version of min-wise hashing algorithm differentially private. \n\nMinwise-hashing is a well know algorithm for estimating Jaccard Similarity between large sets. Jaccard similarity is a widely used similarity measure in many situations including document similarity. In the standard scheme, to improve quality, multiple random permutations need to be used to get multiple hash values. One Permutation Hashing (OPH) is a variant that uses just one random permutation to generate multiple hash values and hence reduces complexity. \n\nThe main contribution of this paper is making OPH differentially private (in the Dwork et al DP framework).   They give DP OPH for three versions of OPH what the authors call OPH with fixed densification and OPH with re-randomized densification (densification is a technique to deal with \"empty bin\" problem that arise in OPH), and OPH with Random bits. The authors also experimentlaly evaluate their   algorithms."
