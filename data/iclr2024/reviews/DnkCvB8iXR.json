                "value": "This paper proposes a framework that exploits the power of large language models to tailor game-theoretic objectives for multi-agent planning. This framework focuses on the generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP). The entire framework is divided into two parts, namely game translator and game solver. First, the motion descriptor in the game translator converts the state into natural language input to the LLM, and then the cost function tuner prompts the LLM to turn the motion description into tuned cost functions in code form. The game solver will give the solution to the corresponding game and let the agent execute these policies in the simulator. The final results will be fed back to LLM to redesign the game. The proposed framework in this paper was experimented on three tasks,  including Autonomous Driving, Stop-The-Poacher and Multi-Agent Transport."

However, I envisage this becoming a potential problem in larger / more complex domains. For example, whilst some form of desired behaviour will always be fairly easy to specify - the increasing complexity of how one would reach that desired behaviour may require more specific details provided by the human. Then the bottleneck instead becomes the human running the experiment instead of the LLM tuner.\n\n2) The authors make note of this in their discussion, however I think it is important that they spend more time discussing the scalability problem of this framework. In particular, what are some techniques / methods that could be used in order to reduce the exponentially growing number of action combinations when either number of players increases or the number of possible actions for each player increases?"

A preliminary section is needed after section 2. Actually section 3.1 should be the preliminary section. section 3.1.1 and section 3.1.2 should be subsection, rather than subsubsection. Please add the preliminary section to define the problem, the objective, the considered solution concept for this work, which is very helpful for reviewers and readers to understand the paper. \nb. For the introduction section, you introduce four necessities about introducing LLM into game-theoretic approaches, e.g., \nAutomated Game Design and Harnessing Domain Expertise, however, these points are not relevant to the methods you proposed and are not shown in the experiment section. So please focus on your problem, and do not discuss so broad topics. Good experiments are better than words to demonstrate the necessities of the methods.  \nc. The technical details are not clear. There are only three parts introducing the techniques, i.e., 'To this end' para in section 1, and sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. Most of them are not technical words, I cannot find the technical descriptions of your methods. Even not equations, please provide the high-level ideas of the methods. \n\n\n\n2. About techniques (based on my understanding, as the paper is not fully elaborated).    \na. When you ask the LLM to design the parameters, what are the prompt? what is the objective when you design these prompts? does this design methods generalizable across different multi-agent scenarios?   \nb. How to handle the limited context length of LLM? Say, when you consider a very complicated, that may exceed the maximum length of the LLM's input, how to handle this? Or, what is the max current length of the prompts across different scenarios in this paper?  \nc. I cannot fully understand what are the motion descriptor and the cost function tuner? please add more details about the two modules, including illustrative figures and examples.  \nd. For the simulator feedback, how to include these feedback into the prompt for the iterative design? is it similar to COT or Reflexion?  Please give more details. Besides, normally when given the parameters of the game, we can receive the final performance, what is the difference between your simulator feedback comparing with the traditional setting? If they are same, why the simulator feedback still need to be highlighted in the paper?   \n\n3. About the experiments. \na. why the three scenarios are chosen? Honestly, the three scenarios are not widely considered in the game-theoretic literature. Why not choosing poker or board game?\nb. The baselines are random actions, heuristic, direct LLM. There would be some domain-specific solvers about the problem, which can be viewed as the upper bound of the LLM's performance. Maybe please add them into the baselines, so we can evaluate the proposed methods against the sota methods."

                "value": "This might be a good article, but there are a number of aspects that make it very hard to evaluate how significant the contributions are.\n\nMy main concern is that the action space of the language model is so small as to be effectively a trivial search problem. I wouldn't be surprised if full ennumeration of the possible strategic space would cost less than a single inference on the language model. Even if not concerned about computational cost (one could argue that it is still worth it knowing that LLMs are capable to reasoning about strategic thinking), the search spaces appear to be so small that it is unclear that the LLM is actually reasoning to any significant degree. I worry that most of the apparent reasoning is built into the agents, which end up being controlled by the LLM goal setting.\n\nAnother aspect that requires elaboration is the prompt template system. This template is tuned in some way over iterations that mostly are due to human feedback. However, we do not get to see prompt, so it is quite possible that everything of interest went into a very cleverly engineered prompt that causes the appearance of strategic behaviour to emerge.\n\nA final critical detail that appears absent is how are the actual agents in the environment trained. They must take the outputs from the LLM as strategic guide, but this requires a mapping of an abstract (and potentially high-level) action, into a policy to be deployed. Perhaps the authors train a policy that can be conditioned on the possible goals chosen by the LLM. If so (and it seems from some of the descriptions that this is the case), then the generality of this algorithm is very limited: it requires setting special ways of extracting text from environments, and also requires taking high-level goals and implementing them as low-level policies that can be easily conditioned on those goals. The fact that this can be done with an LLM in a very low-dimensional space might be rather trivial if so. This seems the case as the heuristic results appear very close to the LLM ones.\n\nThe system appears to operate in two phases, although this is never explicitly described: Tuning: which involves using human explanations of behaviour of lower level agents and that is somehow resulting in a parametric prompt; and Decision making: where the system is behaving autonomously, receiving text observations from the environment that it can use to issue commands to the lower level agents."

What happens when the LLM must output a 10x10 strategy tensor to then solve with game theory? I suspect an LLM would have a _very_ hard time getting such an incentive structure right.\n\nThe authors should provide more details about the inputs and outputs of their model."
