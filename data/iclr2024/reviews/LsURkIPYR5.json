                "value": "This paper presents a novel approach to map learning for autonomous driving systems by utilizing the commonly used PV2BEV feature transformation. In contrast to existing methods, this approach introduces a new representation called \"lane segment,\" which incorporates both geometry and topology information. The proposed model is built upon the BEVFormer architecture and incorporates two key modifications: a lane attention module and an identical initialization strategy for reference points, aimed at enhancing the model's prediction capabilities. The prediction branches of the model consist of multiple MLPs, which collectively generate the final predicted lane segment, including the centerline, laneline, laneline type, and adjacent matrix for the lane topology. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated through validation on the OpenLaneV2 dataset, showcasing a significant improvement over other existing approaches."

This paper introduces an innovative end-to-end approach to jointly predict the centerline and laneline scheme, which is a unique contribution compared to existing methods.\n2. In contrast to MapTR, which employs hierarchical queries for map element prediction, this method utilizes a single query for both centerline and laneline prediction. The authors propose a heads-to-regions mechanism and distribute reference points evenly within a lane segment, thereby enhancing feature aggregation for both long-range and local image features.\n3. By employing an identical initialization strategy, the model achieves remarkable performance on the OpenLaneV2 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and high accuracy."

            "weaknesses": {

The authors mention that the OpenLaneV2 dataset is reannotated using the proposed lane segment manner, resulting in lanes being broken into multiple segments. By using shorter lane segments, I don't think \"long range\" is challange.\n2. Additionally, manually dividing a lane into segments without any visual cues may introduce unnecessary challenges for the model's prediction, whichi is also not critical for autonomous driving systems.\n3. In the context of map learning, the novelty of topology prediction in this paper is limited."

It would help calibrate numbers if they applied their architecture to the original tasks conducted in nuScenes.\n* Figures should be more informative - Figure 2 looks like a generic map prediction architecture and Figure 3 does not help illustrate the lane attention module."
