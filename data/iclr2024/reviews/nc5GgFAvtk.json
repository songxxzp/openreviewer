An intuitive approach to increase the cross-prompt transferability is to use multiple prompts during its creation stage. However, the improvement in cross-prompt transferability of these baseline approaches converges quickly with the increase in prompts. CroPA further improve the cross-prompt transferability. \n\nIt creates more transferable adversarial images by utilising the learnable textual prompts. The learnable textual prompts are optimised\nin the opposite direction of the adversarial image to cover more prompt embedding space. \n\nTo explore the underlying reasons for the better performance of CroPA compared to the baseline approach, it visualises the sentence embedding of the original prompt and perturbated prompts by CroPA, which is obtained by the averaging embedding of each token. The visualisation of difference in the prompt embedding coverage explains the reason why the CroPA methods can outperform the baseline approach even if the number of prompts used in optimisation is less than the baseline approach.\n\nIt experiments with different settings or policies. For example, it explores the effect of different update strategies. It tests the ASRs of the image adversarial examples with the number of in-context learning examples."

This optimization method is widely adopted in adversarial attacks.  It is very similar to adversarial training. To achieve cross prompt transferability, it perturbs the prompts without limitations to maximize the loss and obtain the worst prompt, then it trains the image perturbations based on the worst prompts and the final obtained perturbation can fool the model for different prompts because it already deals with the worst prompts. The novelty may be limited. \n\n\nI am still not very clear about some experiment settings. For example, what is the value of perturbation size $\\epsilon$? Larger $\\epsilon$ usually means stronger attacks. So what is the performance with a different $\\epsilon$?\n\nIt seems that the generated perturbations are used to test for the same model that it was trained. Can the generated perturbations be transferred to other VLMs and what are the performance? It is better to discuss the transferability to demonstrate the generalization of the method. \n\nFor the non-targeted attack after equation (2), the optimisation is expressed to maximize over token and minimize over image. It is almost the same as the targeted attack. I am wondering if there is a mistake here and it should be to maximize over image to make the results of adversarial examples different from the original one. Minimizing over images and the final image perturbation would make the outputs of adversarial examples similar to clean images. It is better to provide more details about this non-targeted attack. I agree that by maximizing the tokens, the generated tokens can mislead the VLM, but here we focus on image perturbations and use the image perturbation to test the VLM, right?"

This security concern would be more valid if the attack successfully tricks VLMs into producing contradictory predictions or harmful instructions. Otherwise, the objective of this study appears to be more like a pioneering exploration of VLMs' adversarial robustness.\n\n2. The author mentions another potential use case for the proposed framework, which is to \"prevent malicious usage of large VLMs for unauthorized extraction of sensitive information from personal images.\" If this is indeed the case, the proposed method should also be assessed in a black-box setting, as users' VLMs cannot be known in advance. However, this set of experiments is absent from the paper. Previous jailbreaking attacks aimed at emerging large language models have shown substantial transferability across models [1]. I am curious whether this holds true for various VLMs as well.\n\n3. I am curious whether some straightforward defense techniques can defeat the proposed attack, such as incorporating data augmentation on the input images [2]. This could provide insights into whether the optimized adversarial perturbation converges to an unstable local minimum and can be easily defended against.\n\n[1] \"Universal and Transferable Adversarial Attacks on Aligned Language Models\", A.

                "value": "The authors propose a method called Cross-Prompt Attack (CroPA) that creates adversarial images, destined for vision-language models (VLMs), that transfer across prompts.  They train on multiple prompts using a variant of projected gradient descent to learn both the image perturbation and the text embedding perturbation. They consider both the targeted and non-targeted scenarios. CroPA achieves better coss-prompt transferability compared to baseline methods when evaluated with OpenFlamingo-9B, BLIP-2, and InstructBLIP on different tasks."

                "value": "- The paper introduces an aspect of adversarial transferability that was not emphasized before. The problem that the paper tries to address is clearly formulated and is worth investigating.  \n- The experimental setup covers a wide range of scenarios: targeted and non-targeted attacks, multiple VLMs (OpenFlamingo-9B, BLIP-2,InstructBLIP) and different multi-modal tasks (VQA, classification, captioning). The baselines are strong."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- The method does not achieve transferability across models or images in addition to cross-prompt transferability. This might limit  its practical applicability.  \n\n- Clarifications are required in some parts of the paper. Certain statements about the \u201ctextual prompts\u201d are misleading. For example, in the abstract, the method is described as follows:  \u201cThis proposed method updates the visual adversarial perturbation with learnable textual prompts\u201d. This might suggest that the method directly modifies the textual prompts or discrete prompt tokens whereas it is actually modifying the embedding of these textual prompts. Moreover, the authors should explicitly state the underlying optimization algorithm (is it projected gradient descent?) , the norm (is it L-infinity ?) and the selected value of the perturbation size for easier comparison with related work.\n\nMinor issues: there are some typos in the paper (for example in the conclusion \u201cbaseline approaches only archive\u201d -> \u201cachieve\u201d)."

Do you only add the prompt perturbations during the optimization phase or do you also add them during evaluation?\n\n- What is the ASR of Multi-P when transferred across models or images?\n\n- Do you have a conjecture regarding the inability of CroPA to achieve transferability across models or images?"
