Based on my understanding, the core of this paper is adversarial attack and defense on diffusion model. However, the introduction of \"diffusion mimicry\" confuses the reader a lot. If authors really want to mention \"diffusion mimicry\", it should be explained that how diffusion model is used for mimicry and why the proposed method is a good defense? \n\n3.

                "value": "1. From my understanding, this method needs the gradient from the misused models. That is, the protection perturbation is generated on the exact model used to maliciously manipulate the image. It's not clear if this generated perturbation is only effective on that model, or if it can protect the image from misuse by an unknown model.\n\n2. No defense methods are evaluated. The malicious people may apply image transformations to remove the adversarial perturbations.\n\n3. It's not clear why minimizing the loss (encouraging LDM to make better predictions) can protect the images. It's very counter-intuitive and needs a better explanation. I can understand that minimizing the loss with respect to certain targets as Photoguard can work because it encourages the LDM to generate an image different from the original image to protect. But why can encouraging the LDM to generate a better image of the original image (the opposite goal of AdvDM) can help? Maybe it's kind of trapping the sample into a local optimum so that the later optimization/editing is also stuck? But this also needs to be justified.\n\n4. In Section 4.3, the conclusion of denoiser being more robust needs more evidence. Figure 2 shows the $\\delta_z$ can be less than 10x $\\delta_x$ for many cases. So I think the 10x budget (Figure 10 has even larger budgets) should be large enough to conduct some successful attacks. It's not clear why they fail.\n\n5. Photoguard has a diffusion attack. Why is only the encoder attack mentioned in the related work and evaluated in the experiments?\n\n6. The detailed setup for the experiments is missing. For example, how many iterations are used for the baselines and proposed method? What is the learning rate? What's the perturbation budget? How large is the fixed $\\delta_x$ in Figure 2?\n\n7. The pseudocode in Appendix A doesn't allow `x` to have gradients because `x=x.detach().clone()` detaches `x` from the computational graph.\n\n8. I suggest briefly introducing the metrics and human studies and having a more detailed explanation of the experimental results in the main text.\n\n9. To show the effectiveness of SDS approximation, one may visualize the loss changes and the gradient landscapes with the original loss function and the SDS loss."

That is, assume the image is protected using a LDM A, when the adversary uses another LDM B to edit the image, will it fail?\n2. Can image transformations such as JPEG compression, cropping, rotation, and rescaling invalidate the protection?\n3. Why can minimizing the loss (encouraging LDM to make better predictions) protect the images?\n4. How are the $z$ and $z_{adv}$ visualized in the figures such as Figure 2?\n5. Could you explain, why attacking the diffusion model via $\\mathcal{L}_S$ outperforms $\\mathcal{L}_T$ if the encoder is less robust than the diffusion model as claimed in the paper?"
