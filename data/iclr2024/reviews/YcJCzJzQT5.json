The model enforces bijectivity by using coupling layers, inspired by the work of  Dinh et al., 2014, to construct an analytical inverse, which is easy to compute and does not restrict the model's capacity shown in theorem 1. In addition, the proposed method reduces computation time by utilizing upper and lower triangular weight matrices in the model, which is demonstrated in Figure 2. Lastly, the proposed method is empirically validated for a variety of inverse problems, including image construction competition and system identification-based state estimation."

Due to the inherent irreversibility of DNNs, the problem is quite challenging; the paper presents a well-designed invertible DNN architecture with rigorous theoretical analysis.
