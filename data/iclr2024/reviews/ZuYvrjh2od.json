The core contribution of this work is to propose an approach to convert existing benchmarks to a unified formulation. However, the authors used many pages to present and discuss the evaluation results, rather than delving deeper into the reformulation methodologies. In fact, many aspects can be explored during the reformulation:\n    1. In general, one need to use some distractors as the negative options when building multi-choice problems. There exists multiple ways to obtain these distractors (as mentioned in this paper): 1. find the negative classes with the highest confidence; 2. find some semantically related but not synonymous answers; 3. LLM-based hard-negative generation. Besides, another baseline is to randomly pick incorrect class labels as negative options. How can the use of those distractors quantitatively affect the evaluation results?\n    2. Fine-grained recognition, which is a substantial component of Fine-grained perception,  is not included in the fine-grained perception tasks."

It would be better if the authors can provide more ablation study for the reformulation process, on factors including: 1. the methods to add the distractors, 2. the number of options. \n4. Reform-Eval is a large dataset contains over 500,000 evaluation instances, when doing the sub-sampling, do the authors do it uniformly or sample evaluation instances from each benchmark with different probability to improves the data balance? Besides, have the authors studied if the shrink of the dataset size will change the evaluation results? Can we use a even smaller subset for evaluation?"

The very impressive ability lies in the large language models (GPT-4, ChatGPT, Llama, etc.) and the popular vision-language model (CLIP) is their powerful zero-shot learning ability. One important way to evaluate the zero-shot learning of models is to ensure there is no dataset overlap between the evaluating data and the training data, such as the evaluating strategy in CLIP[1]. However, ReForm-Eval includes many datasets that are trained in the evaluated VLM. This might incur two issues: (1) it is unfair to compare models that were trained by datasets evaluated in ReForm-Eval with models that have not been trained on any datasets in ReForm-Eval. (2) Ultimately, ReForm-Eval can only evaluate the \"supervised learning\" ability instead of the \"zero-shot learning.\"\n\n2. Some insights might not be solid. For example, (1) when discussing which connection module is more suitable for which visual backbone, this work should ensure that other influential factors are the same between compared models, such as training data and language model. (2) The grouping of high-quality data and without high-quality data might be cherry-picked, as some models (Lynx) in the high-quality group also use \"data filtered on rules or CLIP.\" (3) The variance in Fig. 4 (c) is so large that it is difficult to conclude that \"more instructional data leads to better performance.\"\n\n3. Using CIDEr to evaluate visual descriptions is not optimal, especially for models that intend not to generate concise descriptions, such as LLaVA, and it benefits models that are tuned by dataset, such as coco-caption, whose ground truth descriptions are in a shorter format.\n\n[1] Radford, Alec, et al. \"Learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision.\" ICML 2021."
