The authors propose PIT that modifies the RLHF routine in all three stages: at the supervised fine-tuning stage, PIT maximises the likelihood of the better response conditional on both the instruction and the worse outputs (instead of the instructions only). In the reward model training stage, PIT encodes 4 pairwise relations between good and worse outputs instead of simply optimising the reward gap between better and worse responses. In the RL stage, instead of defining reward only in terms of supervised finetuned models and the RL model, PIT utilises multiple stages of RL to improve both over the annotated examples and iteratively improve over its previous responses (thereby achieving self-improvement). Experiments are done on 3 RLHF datasets, and the authors show that their proposed methods compare favourably both over the original response and over self-refine, a prompt-based self-improvement method."

The idea of curriculum RL to iteratively and continuously improve on LLM outputs is also intriguing.\n- The experimental section is largely thorough, and the improvement over baseline and prompting-based self-refine seems largely convincing. Experimental support is also provided for some (but not all) of the critical designs, such as the use of two (or more) stages of reinforcement learning and the indispensability of each stage. \n- The paper is generally well-written and clear."

On the other hand, self-refine as a prompting-based method is much easier to execute and cheaper I think the paper would benefit if the authors would give more detailed account on the computational cost, including a comparison with the baseline methods. \n- Some claims are qualitatively argued rather than empirically validated. An example is the use of pairwise relation training in Eq (2), a key component of the algorithm\u2019s design. The authors largely provide intuitive explanations against the simpler alternative in favour of the more complicated design the paper adopted, but no empirical validation is provided.\n\n## Minor\n- Typo in openreview title: Lanuguage -> Language\n- First line beneath caption of Fig 1: rubics -> rubrics"

If not, why not? In that case, RLHF should be an obvious baseline to compare against given that PIT is closely formulated based on the original RLHF (I gave the benefit of the doubt in the preliminary review on this point, pending clarification in rebuttal).\n- Do you observe that the reward model remains discriminative after multiple rounds of improvements? It seems to me that the reward model is trained on the original y_w and y_l annotated responses only, but the new outputs should be even better than y_w after a few iterations.\n\n-- **Post-rebuttal** --\n\nI thank the authors for the detailed feedback, which largely addressed my concerns. I also read other reviews, and I will stick to my rating that recommends acceptance. I think the discussion regarding prompting methods might be better qualified, though, as even if the proposed method uses fewer tokens, prompting-based methods have the strength that they do not require model weight adjustments, and only forward passes are required. As discussed in the original review, the results compared to baselines can be occasionally somewhat mixed, so I am unable to give an even higher score. Nonetheless, I believe this paper is of value to the community and can be accepted at ICLR."
