This is not clearly stated. \nThe set S does not define the set of indicator matrices the authors seem to have in mind (there are matrices that fulfill those constraints that are not indicator matrices). Why introduce it this way? Also C is supposed to be N times n, yet the example given is n times N.\n\n* The discussion on heterophily appears out of the blue -- it is not clear what relevance it has to the paper and the technique used.\n\n* The discussion on related work is pretty mixed, but it is not always clear on what these relations are build. There is a whole literature on network summarization, which appears to be largely ignored that is much closer to the type of problems discussed in this paper.\n\n* The notation and decsription in section 3.1 is unclear to me. What are the asterisks as opposed to \\cdot denote? Figure 3 does not really help much either as it is rather cryptic.\n\n* Section 3.2. and 3.3 are not well written either. There is an algorithm but the idea of it is hardly explained and the intuition remains completely absent in my opinion.\n\n* Section 4 appears to be a long list of quality criteria, whose relative merits and selection is never discussed. Symbols appear that have not been introduced before etc.\n\n* It is not really clear what questions the experimental session tries to answer and why. For instance, yes, run-time can be important, but only in conjunction with some other assessment of the quality of the coarsening -- what does 50% coarsening even mean for the other methods? How would you coarsen a graph to 50% by kron reduction -- there are many options. It is not clear what we are comparing here..\n\nOverall the paper appears to have been put together in a rushed manner. There are many typos and grammatical mistakes throughout, the organization is not clear, and the key messages get lost in details."

To do so, they consider the node feature vector in addition to the adjacency matrix. The core idea is to map nodes using this augmented matrix to the same node using an appropriately instantiated LSH. To validate the quality of the coarsening, the authors consider relative eigen error, hyperbolic error, and, to account for the feature vector, bounded $\\epsilon$-similarity. They show computational gains over previous coarsening state-of-the-art in terms of memory and compute time. To demonstrate the applicability of their approach, the authors train a single hidden layer GCN, and show that training on the coarsened graph has negligible impact on accuracy while benefiting from computational gains when tested on the original graph for predictions."

The empirical results indeed hint that the time cost benefits exist, but as the linear time claim is made in the abstract and introduction, this section requires considerable improvement.\n- The choice of downstream GNN architecture feels unjustified. Why specifically convolution instead of GIN, or GAT? More concretely, how should a reader know that the coarsening benefits are not specific to GCN but rather more universally exploitable? Additionally, low eigen error is shown as a benefit, but no investigation was made to show if, for example, the coarsening maps to community detection when performed using spectral methods."
