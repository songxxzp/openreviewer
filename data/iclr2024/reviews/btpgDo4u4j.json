Similar to previous works using latent diffusion, this work first trains a transformer encoder/decoder with weak KL regularization to model trajectory sequences, and then trains a diffusion prior to sample these latents. Then, an energy guided sampling method is proposed to plan in this latent skill space through guided diffusion sampling. The approach is evaluated on the D4RL benchmark, where it achieves strong results."

Unlike the case of latent diffusion for image generative modeling where we simply require high quality samples with improved efficiency, here the primary motivation for leveraging latent planning is to plan with higher level skills."

                "value": "1) Could the authors clarify why they expect a weakly regularized latent space to be useful for planning as compared to the raw actions? I see in the appendix that the comparison is made, and raw actions indeed are shown to perform worse. But I would like some intuition for why this should be the case, and if some better hyperparameter tuning could have produced similar results with raw actions.\n\n2) The authors use the return to go predictions from the decoder as Q values. Since TD learning is not done to learn optimal Q functions, these Q values correspond to those of the behavior policy. Is there a reason some form of offline Q learning technique such as CQL/BCQ/IQL was not done? Without doing Q learning, should we expect skill stitching to occur?\n\nI would also encourage the authors to cite a recent paper from Venkatraman et al. [1], which proposes a very similar algorithm. I am happy to recommend this paper for acceptance, primarily due to its strong empirical results and relevance to the current trends in offline RL.\n\n[1] Reasoning with Latent Diffusion in Offline Reinforcement Learning, arxiv.org/abs/2309.06599"

The key proposal is to use continuous latent action space representations for planning, through the use of latent score based diffusion models. The novel framework takes conditional generative models for planning in the latent domain, where the authors learn a latent action representation and use the latents for planning. The authors propose a multi-stage framework to address the issues of current hierarchical offline reinforcement learning algorithms. The framework utilizes diffusion models to learn latent actions from offline datasets. This paper argues the equivalence between planning with latent action representation and energy-guided sampling."

The paper in its current form can be quite confusing to follow and difficult to understand. \n\nThe model seems overly complicated to understand and it is not clear what the contributions of the paper really are. I understand the relations with the TAP paper and how the work is trying to build from it, but I believe the planning approach based on diffusion doesn\u2019t really have any novel approach? Am I right?\n\nOverall, equation 4 is the objective that needs to be optimzied, with the first term that generates the planning trajectory based on the latents from the diffuser? Am I correct? \n\nExperimental results are compared with few baselines using the D4RL setup. I believe all the results from 5.1 - 5.3 are using the same setup, although studying different aspects of the proposed algorithm? It probably would have been useful if there were much simpler proof of concept experiments, especially focusing on the planning part and how the diffuser plays a role there?\n\nThe experimental results need an explanation of performance in comparison to the baselines.\n\nThe paper requires more proofreading as it contains typos (such as \u201cemploies\u201d)."

The authors demonstrate performance in their experiments and, importantly, provide a useful interpretation with their experiments to demonstrate specifically where they expect to make a difference. The current review system precludes 7 as a score, and until I read the rebuttal I am rounding down.\nSpecific points:\n - Can the authors comment on how the sequence length is determined? Is the sequence terminated externally?\nSmall stuff\n - A reference for the proof for theorem 1 is missing.\n - Is the text inconsistent with Fig2?
