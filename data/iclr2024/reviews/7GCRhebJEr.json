This is accomplished by constructing two convex neural networks that approximate the gradient of the distance-generating function and its inverse. Training the networks involves utilizing a Bregman loss. Additionally, a semantic attack is proposed using Bregman divergence to generate corrupted examples, which are then employed in adversarial training to enhance corruption robustness."

The proposed numerical method for approximating the inverse $(\\nabla\\phi)^{-1}$ appears unrelated to Fenchel's (1949) result. According to Equation (7), the minimization problem $\\min_f \\Vert f(\\nabla\\phi(x)) - x\\Vert_2$ should yield $f=(\\nabla\\phi)^{-1}$, but it is not demonstrated that the L2 distance is the optimal choice.\n2. The evaluation in this paper has limitations. For instance, it remains unclear how the Bregman divergence training converges. Additionally, it is uncertain whether the method can scale to larger images, such as ImageNet. How does the choice of sampling numbers impact the approximation?\n3. The Bregman-based attack finds the projection point $x'$ in the intersection of $D$, which is the intersection of $B_{\\phi}$ and $B$. According to the algorithm, the projection is performed by projecting onto $B$ first, and then onto $B_{\\phi}$. However, it seems unlikely that the resulting projected point will lie in the intersection.\n4. Although Lemma 1 states that $d$ lies in the range $(0, 1)$, it is unclear why Figure 1 is generated when $d=1.\n5. In the experiment, the fraction of $\\Gamma$ functions is defined as $1/\\sqrt{n}$. The purpose of introducing $\\mu$ as the fraction of Gamma functions in Lemma 1 is not clear.\n6. Based on my understanding, each iteration of mirror descent involves one forward pass and one backward pass for the input $x^t$. It is unclear how the computation cost of Bregman divergence training is determined.\n7. The notations in the equations lack consistency, such as the font used for variables like $\\tilde{x}$ and $u$."

The alternative approach in A.2 is a much simpler method to draw samples, which does not require the complicated statement of the Lemma; in fact the experiments use the simpler version in A.2!

When you are training the Inverse Map (Eq. 7), do you use a `detach` operation in practice, i.e. to train the inverse map to emulate the base function without optimizing over the parameters of the base function? As written, this loss would seem to indicate that the base function is optimized to emulate the inverse map.\n3. Do you have any metrics of the fit of the inverse map on the test data? Isn\u2019t it also true that the inverse map could be fine-tuned during test time on the test points (i.e. the learned inverse map is a form of amortization).\n4. How are corruptions $\\tau$ sampled during training? Do you draw a single pair $\\tau, d$ for each training image as an augmentation?\n5. Since the projection $\\Pi_K$ is not available in closed form for a learned base function, the paper uses a binary search heuristic.
