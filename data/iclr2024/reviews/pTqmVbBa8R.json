This has significantly scaled up the simulation, with the neat addition of new capabilities such as individual-style generation and style analysis. This work demonstrates how the latest PEFT methods can significantly scale up fine-grained human behavior simulation. The authors use chess game analysis as an example, but similar simulations could be possible in other domains."

They could have considered other baselines such as ones with standard DNNs for example from one model.\n* Technical contribution to the machine learning communities seems to be limited since the work is a straightforward extension o f the Maia model with small modifications."
