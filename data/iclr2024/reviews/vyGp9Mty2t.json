As illustrated in Table 1, the gains, though in the positive direction, are relatively slight. Such incremental progress might raise questions about the practical implications and advantages of adopting this new approach over existing methods.\n\n2. Non-principled static-transient decomposition. From what I understand now, the current model seems to hinge on a static branch that remains uniform across all subjects, irrespective of their position in the 3D volume. While this might be appropriate in a NeRF-in-the-wild setting, given the fixed positioning of structures like buildings in the real world, its direct application to varied anatomical structures in the abdominal region seems problematic. Every patient's anatomy, although structurally similar, is unlikely to occupy the same 3D space due to innate variations (rigid/deformable transformations). Hence, applying this method without a template registration step appears misguided. \n\nI think a more holistic solution might involve concurrently learning different deformation fields for individual subjects, and mapping each anatomical point to a unified canonical space. This would account for the inherent spatial variations between patients while ensuring a consistent reference frame for reconstructions."

                "value": "- The motivation for conducting joint CT reconstruction. From the perspective of clinical applications, I do not see any reason why we want to do joint CT reconstruction. To my best knowledge, there are no such settings and needs from current clinical protocol. Can we imagine that in a scenario, after one patient is scanned, we do not do the reconstruction right after the scanning but wait until there are 5-10 patients\u2019 scans, then we want to do the reconstruction together? I cannot think about some applications that require such needs, maybe the author can explain more or give some specific examples.  \n- What is the physical meaning of the learned priors? This prior is learned from 10 slices (which mimics 10 different patients). From this setting, I guess the prior may be some \u201caverage\u201d CT image across these 10 images including mostly low-frequency signals. This guess is also supported by the illustration of learned prior in Figure 13 and 15, which is somewhat the general structure of the sliced anatomic structure. But why should this prior be helpful to reconstruct higher quality of CT for new patients? In the sparse-view CT reconstruction, due to the sparse sampling, what is always missing is the high-frequency signal in the detailed structure. Why does such an \u201caverage\u201d image should be helpful to improve the final reconstruction image quality to get sharper and fine structures?\n- How to choose these 10 patients to get the prior? If we consider a setting to use the learned prior for new patients\u2019 reconstruction, how shall we choose the 10 different patients to get the prior? Such as healthy patients or abnormal patients? For example, if there are some patients with tumors, does the learned prior also include such prior in the latent variables and indicate that in the new patients\u2019 reconstruction? Shall there be any relationship between the new patients and prior patients? How can we know if the new patient is normal or abnormal before we get the CT image reconstructed?\n- How does the method deal with registration problems in CT imaging? The validated datasets in the paper seem to be already registered. If we consider the real CT scanning in practice, for different patients, the patient\u2019s positions will always be different. How can this method deal with the position shift when learning the prior from different patients?\n- In the motivation as well as experiments, one important baseline that the paper compares with is MAML [1]. As the author also mentioned, [1] learned an initialization from multiple objects in order to speed up optimization process while cannot achieve better optimization results from the learned initialization. The proposed works share a lot of similarity with [1] while using a different way to formulate and parametrize the learned prior, why the proposed method would achieve better optimization results while [1] not. The results in Table 1 also support these where the scores for these two methods are quite comparable. Besides, does the INR-Bayes and MAML use the same encoding function, embedding size and backbone network structure in this comparison?\n- In the previous works, the paper mentioned \u201cLastly, while alternative joint CT reconstructions like (Shen et al., 2022) [2] use priors from pre-reconstructed images, and (Reed et al., 2021) [3] relies on finding a template image from 4DCT; their practical limitations led to their exclusion from our comparative analysis.\u201d First, to my understanding, these two works are not doing the joint CT reconstruction as claimed in this paper. [2] is doing the CT and MRi reconstruction through INR by using a full-sampled prior image of the same patient as prior embedding, which is a very common setting for patients\u2019 longitudinal study in clinics. [3] is doing dynamic CT reconstruction where different frames share some similarity while maintaining deformable motion, which is also very common in 4DCT setting with motion. Second, I do not see what is the \u201cpractical limitations led to their exclusion from our comparative analysis\u201d, since these two papers\u2019 setting may be more reasonable from practical applications. And their goal is to achieve better reconstruction results instead of fast convergence as [1], so I think these two papers may even be more important to be  compared with to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n- In the setting of \u201cApplying to Unseen Data using Learned Prior\u201d, how are the patients chosen to learn the prior? Would different prior patients influence the reconstruction for the same new patient? Would different number of prior patients influence the reconstruction for the same new patient? When adapt the new patients, will the latent variable also adapt to the new patient?\nComputational efficiency. Based on Algorithm 1, it seems that multiple networks are maintained and trained simultaneously for different patients. Also it needs to iterate through all patient, all time steps, with three loops interleaved. This algorithm looks very costly for memory and time efficiency. Can the paper report the memory and time used in training and testing with comparison of baseline methods?\n- Using some framework figure may be better to illustrate the whole framework.\n\n[1] Learned initializations for optimizing coordinate-based neural representations.

(Introduction)\n\nSee above, to the best of my knowledge, sparse-view CT is not common in clinical practice. Also, can the authors clarify, how reducing the number of angles may reduce cost?\n\n> While many approaches learn the mapping from sparse-view to dense-view images using supervised learning [...] they often necessitate extensive, domain-specific datasets which are difficult to obtain in practice. (Introduction)\n\nSince full-view acquisitions are the de-facto standard in clinical CT and sparse-view datasets can easily be simulated from these data, such datasets are abundant (e.g., the LDCT Image and Projection data [1] contains over 300 full-view, full-dose acquisitions)\n\n**Experiments**\n\nI have several concerns regarding the experiments:\n\n1. Comparison methods. Unfortunately, the authors do not compare their method against standard CNN-based methods (some of which are also mentioned in the introduction). In particular, the authors do not compare their method against approaches that implicitly (e.g., [2]), or explicitly (e.g., in the form of a DNN) incorporate prior knowledge. The authors also don't compare their method against other, previously proposed INR reconstructing techniques for sparse-view CT.\n2. Missing error bars in Fig. 4, 5, & 6. In Tab. 1, over what is the mean $\\pm$ standard deviation computed? Are the improvements statistically significant?\n3. It is well known, that metrics such as SSIM and PSNR are often not in agreement with quality assessment by clinicians [3,4]. While I recognize that a thorough evaluation involving a reader study is beyond the scope of this work, I don't think the results in Tab. 1 justify the authors claim that their method 'sets a new standard in CT reconstruction performance' (Abstract). Upon visual inspection of Fig. 2 & 3, I find that the proposed method removes many anatomical details and I highly doubt that a clinician would find that reconstructions produced by INR-Bayes are significantly better than those produced by e.g. SingleINR.\n\n**Computational complexity and real-world applicability**\n\nWhat is the computational complexity of the method? Are all reconstructions performed for the main paper on single $512\\times 512$ slices? The application to CBCT reconstructions shown in the appendix is on a much smaller (clinically unusable) image matrix. What would the computational cost for one full patient be compared to the other methods and a CNN-baseline?\n\n[1] https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52758026\n\n[2] Chen GH, Tang J, Leng S (2008) Prior image constrained compressed sensing\n(piccs): a method to accurately reconstruct dynamic ct images from highly\nundersampled projection data sets.
