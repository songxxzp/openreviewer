Beyond the better explainability, the authors raise the multiple objectives that XAI should pursue, i.e., Localization, Complexity, Faithfulness, and Robustness, and argue that the proposed XAI, called Sharing Ratio Decomposition (SRD), is superior to the prior XAIs in the 'desiderata'. I am strongly convinced that the future XAI should consider an efficient, effective, precise, and robust explanation by pursuing the desired factors. The comprehensive experimental results in Table 2 clearly show the strength of the proposed XAI method, which is SRD.\n\n**Strength 2:** A lot of qualitative results in the main paper and the supplementary truly help readers visually understand the benefits of SRD. These results clearly contrast SRD to the prior methods. I believe that efforts to show these qualitative results are very important to visually identify the explainability that often relies on the human-concept level evaluation of how well XAI explains the model's inference.\n\n**Strength 3:** A bunch of prior works are clearly compared to the proposed XAI method via extensive simulation results (as shown in Table 2). I expect that the evaluation effort will promote extensive comparison with diversified viewpoints, i.e., Poi., Att., Spa., Fid., and Sta., in assessing future XAIs."

In this version of the article, the description is a quite verbal explanation.\n\n**Weakness 2:** The key reasons behind the gains of SRD are not clearly analyzed. In this paper, the authors have separately pointed out the uniqueness of their method in multiple parts of the paper.
