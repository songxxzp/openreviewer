                "value": "Although the general idea of building a graph where nodes are GPs is attractive and to some extent promising, the concept is not properly exploited in the article. In this regard, the most relevant weaknesses of the paper are: \n\n- The proposed dependence structure between an output node and its parents is Gaussian (eqs 12 and 13), which in turn results in an overall (MO)GP. Therefore, the proposed model could be understood as a (standard) MOGP with a specific kernel. In addition to the conceptual impact of this fact, there is also a practical consequence: It is unclear if the exhibited experimental superiority of the proposal comes from the introduced graph idea or the fact the there is an implicit, more expressive, kernel being used. From the paper is not possible to clarify this because the proposal is only compared empirically to classic kernels for MOGP (e.g., LMC), leaving behind the MO spectral mixture, deep kernels, cross spectral mixture, etc. \n\n- The proposed model introduced the (hyper) parameters \\alpha as weights learned via attention. These hypers have a direct effect on the linear combination of the mean of the marginal GP which models each node. Though the intuition of attention is that it represents cross relationships among variable of interest, there is no reason to assume that they _linearly_ affect the output. In general, attention networks have an MLP stage after the attention stage, where the MLP \"discovers\" the role of the attention weights. \n\n- The authors claim that standard MOGP have _enlarged searching space with countless local optima_. This is general not true, in GPs (and MOGPs), hyperparameters are usually of very low dimensionality (in particular in the LMC considered in this work as benchmark).\n\n- Diagrams in Figures 3 and 4 are not explained, neither in the body of the paper nor in the Figures' captions. Therefore, they do not contribute to a better understanding of the paper.\n\n- In one of the experiment, MOGP performed worse than single-output GP. This is clearly a training artifact: If SOGP are a restriction of MOGP (same kernel), the latter has to perform at least equal or better than the former, unless MOGP is incorrectly trained. \n\n- The purpose of Experiment 5.1 is not clear: synthetic data are not Gaussian, meaning that the measured performance of the methods considered is not indicative of their applicability for the general case or even for the Gaussian case (a hypothesis shared by all models).\n\n- Given the proposed model builds upon a direct effect among  nodes, how can one deal with the missing data case?\n\n- There are relevant works in the literature that are not mentioned in this paper. A model that is particularly similar is the Semiparametric latent factor model [SLFM](https://proceedings.mlr.press/r5/teh05a.html), which builds an MOGP by linearly combining a set of single-output GPs (rather than relating them through a graph as done in this paper). Also, there have been a number of expressive kernels proposed in the last decade, but this paper only considers LMC (one of the first approaches) and GPRN."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "The current manuscript still exhibits several weaknesses. Notably, in certain sections, the paper's coherence is lacking, making it challenging for readers to follow. Mathematical concepts, in particular, suffer from inadequate definitions. For instance, the paper introduces $f^{(i)}_X$ as a latent variable representing the GP functions for a specific target variable i. However, it later employs $f^{(i)}_X$ to denote the distribution of a GP conditioned on its parents (as seen in Eq. 11 and Eq. 13). Given that prior and conditional distributions hold paramount importance in this work, it is imperative that related variables are precisely defined, and vague expressions are avoided.\n\nAdditionally, a considerable portion of the explanations provided in Section 2 concerning directed graphs appears to be redundant. The authors delve into the intricacies of directed graphs and the definition of a Bayesian network, yet the second paragraph on page 4 reveals that the graph relating the GPs in this paper is a fully connected undirected graph (as indicated by the definition of $pa_i$ for all output functions). It begs the question of why the authors did not emphasize this type of graph from the outset. There are several undirected graph models that can be pertinent when dealing with Gaussian variables, including Gaussian graphical models, pararnormal/nonparametric graphical models, and functional graphs. \n\nIndeed, the description of the distributed Gaussian process (DGP) in the paper is lacking. The conventional DGP model, as proposed by Deisenroth and Ng in 2015, operates under two fundamental assumptions. Firstly, it assumes that all GP experts share the same hyperparameters during the training phase, which serves as a mechanism to address overfitting. Secondly, it assumes perfect diversity between the target variable GPs. However, this second assumption does not align with the scope of MOGP, as interactions between GPs are a crucial aspect of the model. The paper also falls short of providing a clear explanation of how the distributed framework depicted in Figure 4 functions.\n\nTo mitigate computational costs, the model introduces DGP, which can also be applied to conventional MOGP. However, the paper falls short in discussing why this solution is faster than the other baselines. Both the attention mechanism and non-Gaussian transformation inherently raise computational costs, making it essential to have a comprehensive and detailed discussion on this issue within the paper. This is particularly important because it is one of the claims made in the paper. Regrettably, the authors only touch upon this matter in the experiments section, which is not sufficient to provide a thorough understanding of the computational efficiency of their approach.\n\nA similar issue pertains to the prediction quality. The proposed solution integrates a combination of existing methods within a unified framework. However, the question arises: why does this method enhance prediction quality and surpass other baselines? While the experiments demonstrate a significant improvement, the underlying reasons have not been sufficiently elucidated within the paper."

Both the graphical structure (attention coefficients) and kernel parameters are estimated in a variational context where the evidence lower bound of the GMOGP is introduced. The GMOGP inference involves less computational and storage ressources compared to the MOGP-LMC, allowing a better scaling of the model.

                "value": "**Questions**\n\n- Although the diversity of the examples, it is not completely clear that the model properly estimated the dependencies between the outputs. Can this be verified in a toy example? I suggest considering a toy example with 3 outputs where one of them is highly correlated to another, and the remaining one has no influence on the other ones. For instance, one may simulate $f_1, f_2$ from a GMOGP and $f_3$ from a SOGP. For the GMOGP, I suggest considering $\\alpha_{1,2}^\\ast \\gg \\alpha_{2,1}^\\ast$. The other parameters of the graphical representation and kernels can be chosen arbitrarily. Once an illustrative sample is chosen, a new GMOGP can be trained considering data from the 3 outputs and initial values of cross-attention coefficients (non-diagonal elements) all equal (to 0.5). The framework is expected to recover the values of $\\alpha_{1,2}, \\alpha_{2,1}$ close to the ones used to generate the dataset and to estimate small values for $\\alpha_{1,3}, \\alpha_{2,3}, \\alpha_{3,1}, \\alpha_{3,2}$. It is also possible to compare the kernel parameters estimated by the GMOGP with the ones used to generate the data.\n- When considering systems with a significant number of \"potentially correlated\" outputs (e.g. $S \\geq 20$), one may think of promoting sparsity in the estimation of the attention coefficients. This may allow focusing the analysis on a subset of \"highly correlated\" nodes (outputs) while isolating the ones exhibiting a lesser influence on the others (i.e. attention coefficient close to zero). For instance, if $\\alpha_{i,j} \\approx 0$ for all $j = 1, \\ldots, S$ and $j \\ne i$ (there is no contribution to the other outputs $i$), and $\\alpha_{j,i} \\approx 0$ for all $i = 1, \\ldots, S$ and $i \\ne j$ (there is no relation with the other outputs $i$), then the output $j$ can be considered independent and it can be excluded from the graphical model. In the aforementioned example with 3 outputs, one may consider excluding the third output. Have the authors considered this experimental setup?\n- Promoting sparsity in the attention coefficient values may simplify the complexity of the resulting model but implies overheads in the inference procedure since all the coefficients are jointly estimated. Is there a possibility to adapt the GMOGP inference scheme to sequentially estimate those coefficients? For instance, is it possible to start the GMOGP model with a minimal number of nodes (1-2) and add new ones using a criterion based on the level of the attention values?\n- Can the authors provide further insights about the limitations of the proposed framework and potential solutions?\n\n**Other minor remarks**\n- Punctuation marks in the equations need to be double-checked throughout the paper (e.g. first line Eq.(3), expression after Eq.(6), Eq.(17)).\n- Page 2, Section 2.1: \"A Gaussian process...\" $\\to$ \"A GP ...\"\n- Page 3, Footnote: To begin with capital letter\n- Page 4, after Eq (12): $k_{\\theta_i}$ is a **Co**variance function\n- Page 5, after Eq (16): \"In addition, Applying... \"\n- Page 6, Section 3.4: \"1-d quadrature\" $\\to$ \"1D quadrature\"\n- Page 9, Table 3: to display all the attention coefficients in the same table or to add pictures instead (see Figure 10b, Appendix B.4.1)\n- In the references: \n    - (Brody et al., 2021): already published in the ICLR 2022 (https://openreview.net/forum?id=F72ximsx7C1).

The work also provides an extension by non-linear transformations in order to fit non-Gaussian data."

Quite consistence in the mathematical notation. There were just a few typos to easily fix.\n\nSignificance (importance): The application of Multioutput Gaussian processes tend to be prohibited in the practice when the number of data observations and  outputs grows. Therefore this work is significant due to allowing the MOGP computational complexities to be considerably reduced and additionally permitting the non-conjugate likelihood/prior scenario to be applied in a practical manner."

                "value": "---Specific comments---\n\n-In the Introduction, where it reads \"the input-output relationship with multivariate Gaussian...\", better \"...with a multivariate Gaussian...\"\n\n-I did not see any literature related to MOGPs with convolution processes which might indeed be a more general approach than the LMC. See for instance works like:\n\n\"P. Boyle and M. Frean, Dependent Gaussian processes (2005)\", \"J-J. Giraldo et al, Correlated Chained Gaussian Processes for Modelling Citizens Mobility Using a Zero-Inflated Poisson Likelihood (2022)\", \"T. M. McDonald et al, Nonparametric Gaussian Process Covariances via Multidimensional Convolutions (2023)\", \"M. A. Alvarez and N. D. Lawrence, Computationally Efficient Convolved Multiple Output Gaussian Processes (2011)\"\n\n-I do not follow what the authors mean by \"on a set of shard GPs\". Is shard an adjective? Was it shared GPs maybe?\n\n-In section 2: \"...is parametrized by: length-scale $l$ and signal variance...\", better to use \"...by: a length-scale $l$ and a signal variance...\"? \n\n-After Eq. (3), change \"vector-valued function... are determined by...\", by \"vector-valued function... is determined by...\"\n\n-After Eq. (4), with the current notation $Y$ might be understood as a matrix instead of a vector, it might be better to clarify the dimensionality of $Y = [{\\mathbf{y}^{(1)}}^\\top,...,{\\mathbf{y}^{(i)}}^\\top,...{\\mathbf{y}^{(S)}}^\\top]^\\top \\in \\mathbb{R}^{NS}$.\n\n-After Eq. (7), shouldn't it be $K_{i,i^{\\prime}}(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})=\\sum_{q=1}^{Q}a_{iq}a_{i^{\\prime}q}k_q(\\mathbf{x},\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime})$?\n\n-In section 3.3, lower case \"applying\" in \"In addition, Applying\". Also, include \"a Gaussian\" for \"...follows Gaussian that can be normalized...\"\n\n-After Eq. (18), the functions $f_1(x), f_2(x),f_3(x),f_4(x)$ should receive a vector $\\mathbf{x}=[x_1,x_2]^\\top$ as argument, i.e., $f_1(\\mathbf{x}), f_2(\\mathbf{x}),f_3(\\mathbf{x}),f_4(\\mathbf{x})$.\n\n-In the figure 5(c), correct the legend \"GRPN\" to \"GPRN\".\n\n---Other Questions---\n\n-In the GMOGP I only noticed a derivation for isotopic data, but I did not see any mention that the method would allow the use of heterotopic data, would the method allow its application to heterotopic data? \n\n-In line with the last question, how is the behaviour of the GMOGP in the context of notable unbalanced data per output?\n\n-It is mentioned that the weights $w_i$ are set equal since there is not priority among the outputs, is this assumption still valid in the context of markable unbalanced data along the outputs?\n\n-From the practitioner perspective, what would it be an appropriate way to initialise the weights $w_i$? Is there much effect on initialising them quite small (say $(0,1]$) or quite big ($>10$)?\n\n-It might be useful to also show the performance comparison with a MOGP with Convolution processes a more general and powerful approach than the LMC. \n\nIt would be important to also discuss about the possible limitations of the work, there was nothing related to it in the paper."
