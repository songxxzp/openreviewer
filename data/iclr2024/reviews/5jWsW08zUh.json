For example, in the intro, the paper stated that \"to put it more accurately, it is the maximum absolute change in the function per unit norm change in the input\". This statement is only true when the function is scaling invariant. Also because of each question is not studied thourouly, many of the aspects are not rigorously studied. for example, the paper studies effective Lipschitz constant but in reality distributional shift may occur and how the effective Lipschitz constant may change is not known. The scope of this paper is too big and each of the questions requires an in-depth analysis.\n\n3. The paper is also not well-organized. This comes from that the paper lacks coherence.

With that, they investigate the trend of the Lipschitz constant, from initialization and during the course of training. Secondly, they discuss the (implicit) Lipschitz regularisation and double descent behavior, mainly in the context of over parameterization setup of the deep models and a bias variance trade off argument is provided. Thirdly, they discuss about the Lipschitz constant in the presence of the label noise, with the main focus of the network capacities vs the noise strengths. A hypothesis is provided: \u201cwhile the network is able to fit the noise, Lipschitz constant should increase\u201d, beyond which the network will reach a memorization threshold, and collapse to a smoother function with a smaller Lipschitz constant. In all the 3 aspects discussed, empirical evidence is provided based on several models and datasets."

The term \"weight decay\" is mentioned only once in S2.6.9 (Page 22) with non-zero values. This implies that all other experiments either employ zero weight decay or the paper lacks sufficient implementation details.
