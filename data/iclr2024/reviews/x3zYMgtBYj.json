This novel approach leverages the low computational cost of the Spike ODE while also enabling the extraction of continuous variations from the Graph ODE. Additionally, the authors introduce second-order spike representations and integrate them into a second-order graph PDE. Notably, their model successfully mitigates the gradient-related challenges, demonstrating its stability.\n\nTo substantiate the effectiveness of their proposed model, the authors conduct thorough evaluations alongside multiple other existing models.

Then why it is important to use GraphODE on such tasks? If it is just trying to alleviate the over-smoothing issue as studied in continuous graph neural network [1], it was not listed as a baseline for comparison and the storyline is not compatible with the experiment results (the storyline is about a dynamical system, experiment results are static graphs).\n\n2. Second, the authors developed second-order representations of SNN, motivated by the higher-order ODE [2] to capture long-term dependencies in complex dynamic systems (page 6 ). Again, the experiment is not targeted at dynamic graphs so why there's a need to develop higher-order SNN? If it is to capture multi-hop neighbors of a node, wouldn't that sacrifice its original advantage of being low-power consumption? \n\n3. The citation format seems to be wrong.

                "value": "This article proposes a new Graph-PDE framework to solve the graph classification problem in low energy consumption scenarios. Graph-PDE combines spike and graph ODE in a unified graph partial differential equation, and proposed the first-order and second-order Graph-PDE. Experiment results show the competitive performance of G-PDE compared to state-of-the-art methods."

This paper incorporates the coupled ODE (spike ODE and graph ODE) into a unified graph PDE, which reserves the advantages of low-power consumption from spike ODE and extraction of continuous changes and subtle dynamics from graph ODE. In addition, this paper propose the second-order graph PDE, which would alleviate the information loss issue in the first-order PDE. \n2.\tSecond-order Spike Representation. This paper first derive the second-order spike representation and study the backpropagation of second-order spike ODE, which is further applied in the second-order graph PDE. \n3.\tTheoretical Analysis of the Gradient. To guarantee the stability of the proposed G-PDE, this paper prove that G-PDE mitigates the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients and improves the trainingability of deep multilayer GNNs."
