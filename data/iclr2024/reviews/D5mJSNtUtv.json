Though they can be deeply coupled with entropy coder, I still think they are only entropy model. \n* As the authors have setup VQ-VAEs with various architectures, I suggest the authors test more variant of VQ-VAE training, such as expoential moving average codebook, and expectation maximization VAE, beyond the current original VQ, gumbel-softmax VQ and SQ. Furthermore, subtle variants of gumbel-softmax VQ, e.g., soft-gumbel / ST-gumbel, penalize KL-term or not can also be studied. Furthermore, it is also interesting to evaluate the sample quality of those VQs, in terms of FID / IS. As the models with better nll (bpd) might not have better sample quality, and vice versa [A note on the evaluation of generative models]. This can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed hardmax-gumbel training strategy. And make this paper more interesting to density estimation community."

The current form of hardmax gumbel VQ can be viewed as a softmax VQ with forward temperature 0.

Where we have one figure for each dataset, and see DSpd vs. BPD? This would make it much much easier to understand the contribution of this paper. Also, some of the methods that have been published for a long time are missing in the table (IDF, IDF++), and I don't know where the 0.057 MB/s for L3C is coming from, interpolating from Table 54 in their paper, I arrive at 0.66MB/s (I was confused because I remember they were only 3x slower than FLIF)\n\nRelated work\nIn the context of STVQ, I am missing a citation to Agustsson et al, 2017, \"Soft-to-Hard Vector Quantization for End-to-End Learning Compressible Representations\", https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00648. IIUC, they applied a similar Gumbal Softmax trick, but also used it in the forward pass (whereas STVQ uses argmax for the forward).
