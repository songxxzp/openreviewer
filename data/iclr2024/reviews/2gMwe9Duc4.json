To ensure the method also works on real-world domains, it would be great to evaluate the method on other datasets such as KITTI, Middlebury, etc. Furthermore, the paper doesn't compare with any previous optical flow inpainting methods (eg., Raad et al, \"On Anisotropic Optical Flow Inpainting Algorithms\"). Achieving better accuracy than baselines is great, but a comparison with previous work would be also necessary to see where the methods stand among the previous works.\n\n  One could also adopt baselines from the depth completion tasks (https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_depth.php?benchmark=depth_completion), train their models on the optical flow tasks, and compare with them.\n\n  The method sounds okay, but due to the limited evaluation, it's difficult to judge if the method is really valuable for the community.\n\n\n- Other applications\n\n  Despite that the proposed method could be generic, the paper demonstrates only optical flow inpainting as an application. Can this method also be applied to other tasks such as depth completion or semantic scene completion? If the paper showed its applicability to such tasks, it could have demonstrated better impact."

What is the difference between yellow and orange layers in the encoder? The inpainting boxes could be more fleshed out to visualize what they are actually doing (are they solving equation 8?). Where do the iterations come into play?\n\nHow does the diffusion tensor D connect to equation 8.\n\nSection 3.1 mentions using average pooling to obtain the coarse version of the sparse flow field. Won't that grossly underestimate the flow field due to all the 0 values? Are those ignored somehow? Are the flow values also scaled down by 2 in each downsampling step, so that they are valid offsets for the coarser image size (similar for upsampling)?\n\nTable 1 could be augmented with train/inference timings, parameter count, and number of iterations. The Figure 3 could be removed and that space used for additional results.\n\nIn Figure 2 left, it would be helpful to put the x axis ticks exactly where the samples are. There are only 4 sample sizes, and marking e.g. 0 on the x axis is really not informative.\n\nIn Figure 2 right, what does the vertical line down the middle indicate? Is that some ideal mask density threshold?\n\nThis sentence is hard to parse: \"When evaluated on a density of 10%, the network trained on 5% density can even reach a very close EPE on to the network that was optimized on this density (0.28 vs. 0.29).\" Does this intend to state that the network trained on 5% density has EPE of 0.29, while the network trained on 10% density has EPE of 0.28, when both are evaluated on 10% density dataset?"

Are there any theoretical explanations for this?\nThere are also many other traditional inpainting methods, are they also suitable in this task and do they work well with neural networks? Why or why not?\n\n3. In the ablation study part, I wonder is coarse-to-fine approach important in this method?
