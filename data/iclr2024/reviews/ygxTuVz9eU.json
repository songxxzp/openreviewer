                "value": "The paper proposes a general \"label\" cleaning/filtering approach and aims to detect three types of errors: \"poisoned samples\", \"noisy samples\", and \"hybrid dirty samples\". The paper takes advantage of the exceptional capability of multimodal large language model (MLLM) and casts the error detection problem into a three-step scoring pipeline. The pipeline consists of 1) visual question generation, 2) visual question answering, and 3) visual answer evaluation. The main argument is that, unlike prior arts, the proposed approach can detect all three types of label errors and achieves better performance in common benchmarks, including ImageNet-100 and CIFAR-10."

For example, SimiFeat-V leverages the feature similarity to detect noisy labels, which is also applicable to the scenario of \u201cpoisoned samples\u201d as long as the feature extractor is trained on a poison-free dataset."

Can the author confirm this?\n2. What are the accuracy of each question?\n    - Figure 2 shows the TRR of the general and label-specific questions. I am curious of what specific question is challenging for the instruct-BLIP. Is there any specific question that is always challenging to the instructBLIP and, therefore, removing those questions actually help the overall performance\n3. Given that the method leverages a ensemble of the MLLM responses, instead of taking the average accuracy as score as in Eq. 4, does the author think that using techniques like label aggregation further improves the overall performances?\n4. To make a fair comparison with other baselines, I suggest the authors could compare baselines with MLLM as well. For example, CL usually trains their classifier with leave-one-out or cross validation, which limits the size of the train dataset. However, one can also uses off-the-shelf classifier and apply CL on it.\n5. Do the authors consider the data-leakage problem? Does the train dataset used to train the instruct-BLIP accidentally include the images in ImageNet or CIFAR? If so, how do accurately validate the performances?\n6. Do the authors observe any accumulated error in the three-step pipeline? For example, the label-specific question include some noisy questions, which leads to poisoned answers in the second stage."
