The authors evaluated several leading LLMs including Llama2, PaLM2, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 against the tasks, and reported the evaluations results. In addition, the authors also conducted error analysis of the results to understand where current LLMs are still struggling in temporal reasoning."

The task difficulty of the TRAM benchmark is not enough to serve the purpose for ongoing evaluations of future more powerful LLMs. 8 out of 10 tasks have close to or better than 90% accuracy when evaluated on the SOTA LLM GPT-4 (5S, CoT). For the same 8 tasks, the gap between GPT-4 and Human is within 5%. This leaves very little headroom for improvement to validate future more powerful LLMs. \n\n2. While the benchmark is designed specific for temporal reasoning, it is not entirely clear how much failure in the errors are due to the model's lack of general reasoning capability, rather than specific to the time dimension. A more careful separation and attribution to either general reasoning and temporal reasoning failures is needed to make the benchmark really useful for gauging temporal reasoning progress."

                "value": "1. The difference between TRAM and previous temporal reasoning benchmarks is unclear: for instance Duration and Frequency are already covered by earlier benchmarks. A more detailed and convincing comparison is needed to establish the necessity of the newly introduced TRAM benchmark.\n\n2. In Section 4.3, the authors claimed that they prompted the model to explain its decisions, and used these explanations to identify errors, understand the reasons, and categorize error types. This is very concerning as LLMs are known to not know what they don\u2019t know. Relying on LLMs to provide the explanations for error analysis puts a big question mark on the reliability of the error analysis conclusions themselves."

These tasks include Ordering, Frequency, Duration, Time, Ambiguity Resolution, Arithmetic, Relation, Temporal NLI, Causality, Storytelling. This work also includes the results of these datasets on various LLMs like GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Llama2, and Palm2 in settings like zero-shot, few-shot with standard prompting, and Chain of Thought. Furthermore, they also include results from BERT and RoBERTa. The authors also did a thorough error analysis to find out where the models were going wrong and gain a better understanding of the mistakes the models were making."
