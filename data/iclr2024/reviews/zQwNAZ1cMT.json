Two algorithms are given (one with theoretical guarantees, and the other one without theoretical guarantees but faster in practice), and an illustration of their performance is given in a couple experiments (synthetic QP and portfolio optimization). The theoretical guarantee for the first algorithm provides an O(sqrt((T)) bound on the regret subject to several assumptions on the structure of the problem --- in particular, compared to prior work multiple objectives (and multiple constraints) are possible to handle."

                "value": "1. The proposed algorithmic setup, and analysis, are very similar to Dong et al (2018), except for the fact that while Dong et al have 1 objective and their loss function is seen to be convex/smooth --- meanwhile, the authors here give several extra assumptions that once again make the loss convex and sufficiently Lipschitz, and a similar argument then gives the new generalized statement. Thus, I judge that from a theoretical standpoint the present work is quite incremental. Moreover, the authors only mention Dong et al briefly and do not go into any technical comparison at all, so if I hadn't read Dong et al I would have had a more positive opinion of the paper's novelty; thus such a literature review appears inappropriate. \n2. A significant issue that I personally have with this paper is that it appears, in several spots in the main part (i.e. excluding the appendices), to blatantly \"oversell\" its technical contributions, which I do not consider appropriate and therefore am even more so not willing to support this paper at this point:\n--- Right before section 3.1, it says \"Thus, the popular gradient descent algorithms Bottou, Kulis & Bartlett fail and our problem is significantly more difficult than most of them.\" Meanwhile, later on, the setup of Kulis and Bartlett is successfully used by the authors after they impose several simple to state assumptions on the problem.\n--- Right after the statement of Theorem 3.2, it is stated that \"Our extension involves several critical and complicated analyses for the structure of the optimal solution set as well as the loss function, which is essential to our theoretical understanding.\" In reality, the proof contained in the appendix basically plugs the assumptions made by the authors into Kulis & Bartlett's result, aided by a few lines of simple calculation with nothing more than Cauchy Schwarz --- I think it should be clear from this description that not only is the novelty of the proposed analysis quite slim, but also nothing \"critical and complicated\" is learned about the \"structure\" of the problem from there. \n3. There is quite a bit of chaos surrounding the distinction between the idealized loss l and the sampled loss l_K. For instance, the regret bounds are derived as if the algorithms used the ideal loss l, whereas in fact they use l_K as presented and used. No nontrivial guarantees are given with respect to e.g. randomly sampling the weights, other than the result in the appendix --- which notes the intuitive worst-case (i.e. curse of dimensionality type) gap of 1/K^{1/(p-1)} between the ideal and approximated losses, where p is the number of objectives and K is the number of samples, but that result only seems to consider (but doesn't explicitly spell out) a uniform grid of weights.\n4. The accelerated algorithm would be interesting to analyze, which would significantly improve the technical novelty of the paper; but this is not provided."

            "questions": {
                "value": "1. Why is Assumption 3.3 stated as it is? Its statement is not particularly well justified at the moment, and the only purpose it seems to have in the proofs is to imply that the idealized loss l is convex. However, the reader wouldn't know this unless the appendix is thoroughly checked. Once again, barring a misunderstanding on my part, this might appear to be an instance of deliberate obfuscation for the purposes of the review process.\n2. Assumption 3.3 should be endowed with more examples, simply because while the authors promise \"Examples are given in Appendix\", but the corresponding section of the appendix contains just one simple --- and not worked out --- example, which says \"Although tedious, one can check that one can check [sic] that Assumption 3.3 a is indeed satisfied\".\n3. More depth in the experimental section would be required to change my overall evaluation of the paper; e.g. along the lines I've indicated in the Strengths section.\n4. What is the purpose of including, and elaborating on, the KKT-based program for solving for the implicit update 3, if it is both more interpretable and parallelizable to solve K parallel problems as in 4?\n5. Please disambiguate where l versus l_K are used (as noted above), and ideally I would like to see a more useful analysis of l vs. l_K than currently provided."
