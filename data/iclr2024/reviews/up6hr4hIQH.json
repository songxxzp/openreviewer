                "value": "The paper tackles the crucial challenge of evaluating the fidelity of explanations provided by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Given the increasing importance of GNNs in sensitive sectors, understanding their decision-making process is paramount. Traditionally, fidelity metrics like $Fid_+$, $Fid_-$, and $Fid_\\Delta$ have been utilized to measure the correctness of these explanations. The intuition behind these metrics is to assess the change in model predictions when certain subgraphs, deemed important for predictions, are masked out or removed. However, the authors spotlight potential issues with these metrics, chiefly the distribution shift when subgraphs are removed. An information-theoretic framework for GNN explainability is presented, highlighting the misalignment of prevalent surrogate fidelity metrics with their proposed fidelity measure. As a solution, a novel class of fidelity measures that are robust to distribution shifts is introduced. The paper validates these measures through empirical analysis on synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that the new metrics align more closely with ground truth explanations."

To address this, the authors design fidelity metrics which add/remove edges such that the explanation subgraphs approximate the training data distribution during evaluation of fidelity. I have three questions regarding this:\n1.  What are the authors\u2019 thoughts on how the nature of explanations should be? I think intuition says that explanation subgraphs should indeed be OOD w.r.t. the data distribution, after all, we\u2019re looking for *sub*graphs that stand out (can be predictive on their own). Do authors generally think that the field should be moving to finding IID explanation subgraphs (if this is possible)? \n2.  It appears that the OOD aspect is addressed in the proposed fidelity metrics. However, it seems to me that the sampling when computing fidelity metrics means that these metrics are not actually measuring fidelity of the actual explanation subgraph (but down/up-sampled versions of it). Why/how can we say that these fidelity metrics actually correspond to the explanation subgraphs themselves when these metrics measure fidelity *not* exactly for the explanation subgraphs? \n3. A different direction could be to accept that predictions for OOD subgraphs are not as accurate and compute fidelity metrics and compare explanations for subgraphs with the same sparsity level, as is done in https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/2c8c3a57383c63caef6724343eb62257-Paper.pdf What are the authors\u2019 thoughts on this?\n\nThe authors have done a great job at studying how fidelity metrics are not well behaved for a wide range of scenarios, which is a crucial question in GraphXAI. I, however, have some questions regarding their solution to the OOD issue of explanation subgraphs, specifically, my question 2. If this (and other concerns) are addressed, I am open to updating my score."
