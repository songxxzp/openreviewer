Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention \u2013 MICCAI 2023, 184\u2013194.\n2. Seizure involves long-range temporal dependency (e.g., 30 second). The proposed onset detection task uses very short window length (e.g., 1s) as inputs, which could be a limitation and prevent the model from learning long-range temporal dependency in EEGs.\n3. The proposed metrics (diagnosis rate and wrong rate) only measure the correctness of predicting the start of the seizure, but do not measure the correctness of the predicted duration of the seizure.\n4. Baseline selection seems a bit arbitrary. The models mentioned in Appendix Section A3 are seizure detection models and are highly related to this paper, but not all of them are chosen as baselines. e.g., BrainNet (Chen2022) and GraphS4mer (Tang2023) are not included as baselines. In particular, GraphS4mer also captures dynamic brain connectivity, so it would be good to compare DSN to it.\n5. No details about hyperparameter selection is provided."

Were the examples in Figure 6 and Appendix Figure 9 reviewed by clinical experts? If not, please acknowledge it as a limitation.\n6. As mentioned above, the seizure onset task does not capture long-range dependency in EEG during model training. Please acknowledge this limitation. A more optimal setup may be to train the models using longer window lengths, but predict seizure/non-seizure label within a short window (e.g., 1s) at inference time.\n7.

This is critical and does not posit a fair comparison. Other models were not designed for this architectural configuration or experimental setup. Its not clear what is model dimension. How were model parameters chosen for benchmarks? Was a grid-search performed for all of them and for both tasks (streaming and static) independently?"
