Unlike the previous method that requires gradients w.r.t the entire model parameters, the proposed LoRA-guided criterion only needs to compute the gradients w.r.t up and down low-rank matrices, which can be very lightweight. Based on the method, the authors propose LoRAPrune, which progressively prunes unimportant weights. The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms the previous LLM-pruning algorithms, given the similar compression rate, while also reducing memory usage."

Such a pronounced reduction in PPL threatens the practical utility of the model. When evaluated with a context window of 2048, a PPL degradation of just 1 already surpasses the performance differential between LLaMA-13B and LLaMA-30B. A mere PPL degradation of approximately 0.2 can account for the disparities between LLaMA and Llama-2. Although the PPL values in the paper might not align with the precise window size I used, but a PPL degradation of 4 unquestionably renders the resulting model inconsequential.\n\nMoreover, I find that the overall methodology is very similar to LLM-Pruner. The only distinction lies in the methodology for computing importance metrics. However, I have reservations about the pivotal significance of the 'starting point' for fine-tuning. Concurrent research, such as Wanda and Sheared-Llama, has demonstrated that fine-tuning a pruned model on a relatively extensive corpus (e.g., RedPajama) diminishes the disparities between LLM-Pruner and more sophisticated, optimization-based pruning criteria (refer to the Sheared-Llama's appendix for more insights). Hence, I am skeptical about the true value of the proposed method, especially when the pruned model is meticulously fine-tuned. Notably, the memory constraints of LLM-Pruner can be effectively mitigated through off-loading, such as utilizing CPU memory to store certain gradients.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not requesting the authors to directly compare their work with Wanda and Sheared-Llama, as these papers have been simultaneously submitted to the same venue. Nonetheless, the insights and findings presented in these two papers may offer valuable context for my assessment of this paper."

I would like to consider revising my rating based on the authors' feedback. \n- To the best of my understanding, the novelty of this paper is limited. Specifically, there are some existing explorations on identifying the dependency during structural pruning to maximally preserve the performance after pruning, such as LLM-Pruner. In this paper, the key difference is that the authors propose to shift the computation of dependency from backbone weight in LLMs to LoRA adapters in LLMs. The author may want to further address the novelty here. \n- In Table 1, the authors claim that LLM-Pruner does not support tuning. However, as LLM-Pruner also uses a structural pruning technique, it is also compatible with LoRA adapters, which is indicated in the abstract and experiment sections in LLM-Pruner. The authors may want to further justify their claim. \n- In Figure 3, the author missed an important baseline, LLM-Pruner. It would help the authors to better understand the performance of the proposed LoRAPruner by adding the LLM-Pruner baseline in the figure."
