It is based on a simple observation that the attention maps of  adjacent  transformer blocks share similar patterns. Authors propose to reuse the attention maps of the current block in the next several ones by introducing a series lightweight operations, like linear transformations and efficient channel attention."

They observe that reusing the attention maps in the next transformer block does not brings performance drop. The authors should more clearly explain the differences between this paper and the work mentioned above.\n\n- The baselines used in this paper are not recently proposed. The results are already not state-of-the-art compared to recent works, like CMT (CVPR'2022). I would like to see how would the performance go when the proposed approach is applied to recent state-of-the-art ViT models as they mostly did not change the self-attention part.\n\n- Many ViT models are based on window self-attention, which is original proposed in Swin Transformer (ICCV'2021). The authors have shown that the proposed method works well for the original self-attention. So, how would the performance go when the proposed method is applied to ViTs with window self-attention.\n\n- In my view, one of the important functionalities of this paper is to compress vision transformers. Maybe the authors can show more comparisons with methods for compressing ViTs, like DynamicViT and EViT. As I found the proposed approach can improve the baselines' performance with even less computations. This may better highlight the strength of this paper."

Thus, it would be better for the authors to study if other pretrained ViTs (MAE [A], DINOv2 [B], SAM [C]), have the same phenomenon.\n\n2. Introducing convolution into ViTs has shown to be effective in related works [D], which is intuitive to me to achieve performance gain for SKIPAT. In this paper, SKIPAT adopts convFFN as a parametric function to replace MSAs, which still needs to be trained from scratch in order to achieve efficiency gain. It would be promising if this parametric function can be used as a drop-in replacement for existing large ViTs.\n\n\n[A] He, Kaiming, et al. \"Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2022.\n\n[B] Oquab, Maxime, et al. \"Dinov2: Learning robust visual features without supervision.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07193 (2023).\n\n[C] Kirillov, Alexander, et al. \"Segment anything.\" ICCV (2023).\n\n[D] Wang, Wenhai, et al. \"Pvt v2: Improved baselines with pyramid vision transformer.\" Computational Visual Media 8.3 (2022): 415-424."

Following similar insights in (Raghu et al. 2022), the authors observe that self-attention operation is redundant at least in the intermediate layers, i.e. there is high correlation between:\n* (CLS -> token) Attention maps between  at layer $L$ and layer $L - 1$.\n* MSA representations between layer $L$ and layer $L - 1$.\n\nLeveraging this insight, the authors propose to replace the more computationally intensive attention operation with a lightweight refinement module termed SkipAt. More specifically, MSA at depth $L$ is replaced with inverted bottleneck layers (depthwise convolutions sandwiched between two dense layers). SkipAt layer $L$ takes the output of SkipAt layer $L - 1$ as input, as opposed to Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) at layer $L$ which takes the output of the MLP layer $L - 1$ as input.\n\nThe authors show experiments on classification, segmentation, unsupervised object discovery and image (+video) denoising.  They plugin their SkipAt technique and attain improved throughput and in most cases, improved accuracy."

                "value": "## Major Requests:\n-----------\n\n* The main motivation of SkipAt is that the output representations of MSA in vision transformers are redundant. So, the paper claims that just refining the outputs of the previous MSA layers is sufficient. However, SkipAt consists of depthwise convolutions which are also quite powerful modules themselves, so it is unclear if the throughput gains come just by the convolutions rather than the SkipAt formulation. I suggest that the authors run the couple of ablations below, If these ablations reach lower accuracy, it would be convincing that the SkipAt formulation is responsible for the accuracy gains.\n  * Replace all layers with SkipAt instead of just layers from 3 through 8. According to the authors hypothesis, since layers 9 though 12 have lesser correlation, using SkipAt at these layers should hurt accuracy.\n  * To show the importance of skipping the attention blocks, in Eq 7) the authors can replace $\\phi(Z_{l-1}^{MSA})$ with just $\\phi(Z_{l-i})$. This will give more evidence that skipping the attention block is necessary.\n\n* The authors test their module on Ti, B and S which all have 12 layers so they recommend to use SkipAt layers from 3 through 8. How do they recommend tuning these for larger depths?\n* In page 6, authors say that $n >> d$ and so $O(n^d)$ term dominates. I would suggest the authors add that this is specific to dense prediction tasks, since for image classification even for a S model (d=384, and n=196), so the claim that n >> d is not general.\n* Are the throughput increase in Fig a) significant? What do the error bars look like?\n\n## Minor Comments:\n-----------\nThese are just nice to have and are not likely to influence my final rating.\n\n* The authors use the efficient channel module. But, the ablation is missing from Table 5.\n* The figures from Raghu et al, indicate that there might be redundancy across the MLP layers as well. Does it make sense to have a Skip-MLP module?\n\n## Minor suggestions:\n------\n\nSome suggestions to improve presentations:\n\n* The authors can consider making the numbers in Figure 3 and Figure 5 bigger.\n* It is clear by comparing Fig 3 b) and Fig 5 b), that Fig 5 b) has lower correlation. The authors can also have a line plot where the x-axis is the layer id and y-axis is the average correlation of layers before it. If we plot the baseline ViT and the ViT with SkipAt on the same graph, it will make the comaprison even clearer. \n* In Fig 1), are the circles to indicate #params necessary since they are roughly the same? It gives the impression that the improvements are not significant even if they are, since the circles overlap"
