                "value": "A new method called Order-Preserving GFlowNets (OP-GFNs) has been proposed to address issues with Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) in sampling candidates with probabilities proportional to a given reward. GFlowNets can only be used with a predefined scalar reward, which can be computationally expensive or not directly accessible, and the conventional practice of raising the reward to a higher exponent may vary across environments. OP-GFNs eliminate the need for an explicit formulation of the reward function by sampling with probabilities in proportion to a learned reward function that is consistent with a provided (partial) order on the candidates. The training process of OP-GFNs gradually sparsifies the learned reward landscape in single-objective maximization tasks, concentrating on candidates of a higher hierarchy in the ordering to ensure exploration at the beginning and exploitation towards the end of the training. OP-GFNs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both single-objective maximization and multi-objective Pareto front approximation tasks."

However, this is usually not the case for flow matching, detailed balance, and sub-trajectory balance. It would be better to make this claim in a more clear way. In addition, it would be better to include a more extensive study of OP-GFN with other more advanced learning objectives (e.g., FM, DB, SubTB with temporal difference based objective) with a more thorough discussion. \n\n> Large $R_0$ encourages exploration but hinders exploitation since a perfectly trained GFlowNet will also sample non-optimal candidates with high probability; whereas low $R_0$ encourages exploitation but hinders exploration since low reward valleys hinder the discovery of maximal reward areas far from the initial state. \n\n$R_0$ actually determines the sparsity of the reward function -- with a larger $R_0$, the reward function is less sparse, while a smaller $R_0$ corresponds to a high sparsity in the reward function. Therefore, it is inappropriate to say that \"Large $R_0$ encourages exploration\" and \"low $R_0$\" encourages exploitataion.

Is there something I'm missing?\n    - First of all, the whole thing is discrete and operating on sets. It makes no sense to talk about piecewise linearity because we are not in $\\mathbb{R}$, the pieces \"in between\" don't even exist.\n    - Ignoring the above, the shape of the function doesn't really matter? What matters is $\\mathrm{order}(a,b) \\equiv \\mathrm{order}(\\hat R(a), \\hat R(b))$, which follows in a fairly straightforward way once we assume 0 loss.\n- Proposition 3/6 is similarly weird, why this specific choice of MDP? I'd recommend either introducing why this choice matters, or maybe at least state that the general case is much harder to provide theoretical statements for. I find the current form a bit awkward\n- 4.2; the authors seem to be using the molecular setup of Shen et al., not Bengio et al.. Shen et al.'s setup is quite different (and more simple, the state spaces are made to be much small so that computing $p(x; \\theta)$ becomes tractable). It would be appropriate to note this. It's not clear what \"choices\" the authors are using from Shen et al. since quite a few are introduced in that work (which appear to have a significant impact)\n- \"optionally use the backward KL regularization (-KL) and trajectories augmentation (-AUG) introduced in Appendix E.1\", these options don't seem to have that much impact, but it's a bit weird that they're just mentioned in passing in the main text.\n- \"we observe that OP-GFNs can learn a highly sparse reward function that concentrates on the true Pareto solutions, outperforming PC-GFNs.\" It's a bit weird to claim here that OP-GFNs are outperforming PC-GFNs, because they learn entirely different things. From Fig 5.1 it seems like PC-GFN is attributing some probability mass on the Pareto front points, which suggests to me that it has discovered them. \n    - This is maybe more of a comment on RL literature, but I'm also not a fan of comparing algorithms on a grid. Gridworlds are useful to sanity check algorithms, not to compare algorithms.\n- In Sections 4 & 5, it would be good to clarify what work introduced what task and what MDP setup which is being used.\n- Why build on GFlowNets? Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan of GFNs, but it seems to me like the use-case of that framework is to obtain \"smooth\" energy-based amortized samplers, whereas the proposed work is meant to converge to an extremely peaky distribution where essentially $p(x^*)=1$, and is much more akin to finding the optimal greedy policy in RL. There may be a very good reasons (I can think of some ;) but I think the paper could do a better job of explaining them."

It might be worth exploring alternative training strategies to mitigate this potential challenge.\n\n2. Experimental results are not that persuasive, having little improvement over baselines. For example, this work just compares with simple GFN baseline in molecular tasks, more competitive baselines (e.g., subTB, FL-GFN, RL methods) are needed. \n\n---\n\n\n**Discussion needed regarding temperature conditioning methods**\n\nThere are some researches on temperature-conditioned GFlowNets, which learn a single model for multiple reward functions conditioned on different temperatures. It may be more persuasive to compare the proposed method with the following literature [1], [2], especially in single-objective settings. Note that reviewer understands that temperature-conditioned GFlowNets are too recently proposed, so the authors could not reflect this in this submission but suggest making some discussion in the final version for future researchers!\n\n[1] Zhang, David W., et al. \"Robust scheduling with GFlowNets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.05446 (2023).\n\n[2] Kim, Minsu, et al. \"Learning to Scale Logits for Temperature-Conditional GFlowNets.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.02823 (2023).\n\n---\n\n**Decision**\n\nThis work is novel, well-written, easy to understand, and provides insight for GFN communities. Although experimental results do not strictly outperform every competitive baseline, this work provides a lot of experiments over various tasks. To this end, the score would be 6."

                "value": "**Section 4.2**\n\nAuthors say that they compare the proposed method with GFN-$\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the selected value from the previous work. As far as I know, the temperature is not tuned in the previous work. What if we assign high values to $\\beta$? It seems that we can achieve higher topk reward by sacrificing diversity when we assign high values to $\\beta$ and authors only consider maximal objective in single-experiment setting\n\n**Section 5.2, 5.4**\n\nAuthors say that they use a replay buffer and do off-policy training. I am curious that as the reward function is trained across training, off-policy training may lead to degrading performance. \n\n**Minor Questions**\n\nSection 4.1) $u_0\\$ seems a typo. Maybe $R_0$?\n\nSection 4.3) Authors propose two implementation tricks, KL regularization and trajectories augmentation. Especially trajectories augmentation has shown superior results in the previous paper. It is hard to capture when those two tricks are applied. While authors say trajectory augmentation is applied in molecule design (E.3.2), main paper say that trajectories augmentation is optionally used in NAS environment. It may be helpful when those two tricks are applied across differnt experiment settings."

By this extension, they show how exploration and exploitation can be controlled, such that candidates higher in the hierarchy can be given more preference. The method shows benefits for both single objective and multi-objective cases by conducing experiments on a variety of tasks."

It will be useful to add standard deviation and error bars across experiments. It will also be useful to better understand the variance across different GFlowNet objectives and baseline methods.\n\nBy addressing these concerns with experiments, the authors will help address the empirical limitations to strengthen their theoretical discussions and the overall contribution."
