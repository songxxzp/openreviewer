Even though you are proposing some universal framework, it's still better to introduce some running examples to facilitate the understanding of your claims. For example, you can use a MNIST example for illustration of different modeling scenarios.\n3. During my reading, I do have a feeling that you are more or less re-introducing big learning from a high level, without more concrete or statistical analysis.\n4. Section 3.2.3 essentially proposes a more general form of VAE ELBO. However, regarding the specific cases, one still have to reduce the form to more specific ones that we are more familiar with. Moreover, when you claim sth big, readers expect some more convincing and comprehensive experimental results. \n5. MNIST, FashionMNIST are well-studied datasets. I'm not sure if they really need large foundation models.\n6. Also, the major results you are showing are mostly qualitative, lacking more concrete quantitative ones."

Can you please distinguish your Biglearn with the work in CVAE [A] ?\n\nW3: It seems the algorithm is only compared with vanilla VAE, whereas there have been many other SOTA version of VAE. The empirical evidence does not address the comparisons with these methods. \n\nW4: An algorithmic flow will probabaly help in terms of clarity when presenting the sampling procedure. \n\nReference:\n[A] Kihyuk Sohn et al., Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models. nips 2015"

It is designed as a transformer architecture, where missing values in 'x' are masked. A special 'CLS' token is used in the final position to generate a probability distribution over the latent variable 'z'.\nConditional Decoder: The decoder is adapted to accept both the latent variable 'z' and a partial 'x'. It then reconstructs the missing components of 'x' sequentially. This is achieved through a transformer setup with masking for the missing values, using an index-based approach to handle the decoding of missing elements of 'x'.\nAdditionally, the authors introduce a distribution over which positions in the input are missing. The decoder is trained across all possible combinations of missing and present data."

Consider a 2 dimensional x = (x1, x2), then \n$$p(x1| mask, x2, z)p(x2|mask, mask, z) \\neq p(x2|x1, mask, z)p(x1|mask, mask, z)$$\n\nSo, unlike expected by the authors, this approach doesn't allow for modelling arbitrary conditional distributions $p(x_T|x_S, z)$\n\n 2) > $\\text{Both optima have already been modeled in the parameterized } p_\\Phi(z | x_{S'}).$\n\nThis is incorrect. The definition of optimal $q_M(z|x_T)$, that is, $p_\\theta(z|x_T)$, is a distribution that follows from Bayes' rule, that is\n$$p_\\theta(z|x_T) \\propto p_\\theta(x_T|z)p(z) $$\n$p_\\Phi(z | x_{T})$ doesn't model this distribution \n\n3) The notations used throughout the paper are very confusing. The same q had been used to represent the emprical data distribution, the posteriors and the distribution over indices q(S,T). \n\n4) The writing of the paper can be improved. Primarily, it is not a good idea to present the paper as a special case of big-learning [1] (an unknown unpublished/rejected work that claims to be all-encompassing). I tried reading the big-learning paper but there were too many errors in that paper to go-through.\n\n[1] Yulai Cong and Miaoyun Zhao. 2023. \"Big Learning: A Universal Machine Learning Paradigm?\" [Online].
