The paper presents two specific variants of this innovative prompting mechanism: V-ADT, which utilizes prompts designed to optimize learned value functions; G-ADT, where the prompts provide subgoals, strategically directing the policy toward the ultimate objective. Proposed methods demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional DT-based techniques and hierarchical methods on the standard D4RL benchmarks."

                "value": "**Strength 1: Effective Approach to a Critical Issue**\n\nThis paper addresses a crucial issue in the realm of Decision Transformers (DT), particularly the challenge associated with handling the returns-to-go (RTG) and integrating value functions during the DT training phase. There is widespread agreement on the necessity of this challenge within the field. The proposed solution, which involves learning a prompt to feed into the policy of the DT, is not only a plausible approach but also one that has been empirically substantiated, showing enhanced effectiveness over existing DT-based methodologies. This validation underscores the method's potential impact and applicability within the discipline.\n\n**Strength 2: Noteworthy Innovation in Synthesis**\n\nWhile the individual components utilized in the proposed method might not be pioneering in isolation\u2014such as the employment of in-sample optimal values (akin to value-based approaches like IQL), the adoption of hierarchical structures for subgoals (seen in strategies like HIQL), or the application of weighted regression techniques (as in AWR)\u2014the paper's true innovation lies in the synthesis of these elements within the framework of Decision Transformers. \n\nThe authors have skillfully amalgamated these various concepts, producing a methodology that, in its entirety, presents a significant departure from conventional approaches. This fusion of ideas, culminating in a cohesive and well-articulated study, embodies substantial novelty. \n\n**Strength 3: Insightful Ablations**\n\nGiven the many components of the proposed method, it's important to empirically validate the source of the gain the proposed method may offer. In this sense, the authors made a great effort on additional experiments from page 7 to 9."

                "value": "**Weakness 1: Limited Empirical Superiority**\n\nThe primary data presented in Table 1 indicate that while V-ADT demonstrates a notable advancement over other DT-based methods, it fails to consistently surpass or significantly differentiate itself from value-based strategies. This observation is critical, particularly since V-ADT incorporates a value function trained via IQL during the formation of its high-level policy, suggesting that its performance should be directly contrasted with these value-based counterparts. The authors' choice to emphasize the superiority of V-ADT within the DT category, marked in bold, might inadvertently misguide readers regarding the method's comparative effectiveness. It remains unclear why V-ADT, despite leveraging the advantages of pre-trained IQL values, does not achieve a substantial performance lead over IQL itself. A more in-depth discussion on this aspect would enhance the paper's credibility and help readers understand the practical implications and potential limitations of integrating value-based components within a DT framework.\n\n**Weakness 2: Insufficiency of Information for Replicability**\n\nThe absence of shared code alongside the paper significantly hampers the research's transparency and the reproducibility of its findings. The explanation provided in Appendix A, particularly the vague descriptions in the concluding section, lacks the detailed guidance necessary for readers to independently replicate and verify the proposed method's effectiveness. Considering the empirical foundation upon which the method stands, it is imperative for the authors to release the corresponding code, ensuring that peers can thoroughly evaluate, validate, or even potentially improve upon the methodology."

The study begins by shedding light on various challenges within the realm of DT, primarily focusing on issues like inaccurate return-to-go (RTG) estimates resulting from initial estimations and the inability perform stitching. The authors propose a solution by introducing a simple network, conditioned solely on the current state, which generates a prompt for the high-level policy. Furthermore, they refine the low-level policy by conditioning it on both the state, historical data (excluding returns), and the generated prompt to enhance in context learning.  Advantage regression is used to train the low-level policy since the value tokens are not conditioned on the actions. The paper explores two distinct prompt styles: one based on value, learned using in-sample optimal value, to address the RTG estimation issues, and another that outputs a goal state prompt, learned using HIQL.\n\nThe experimental component encompasses a variety of D4RL environments, with particular emphasis on hierarchical envs. The results show improvements mainly in the hierarchical environments. It also shows issues related to variance when tuning target returns, showcasing consistent performance using the proposed approaches. Additionally, the paper provides insights through various ablations, which involve removing RL losses and prompts, among other factors."
