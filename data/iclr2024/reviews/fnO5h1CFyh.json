                "value": "The article has three main shortcomings:\n\nThere is a lack of theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithm. Many parts of the article involve approximations or assumptions, but the author fails to discuss these aspects. For example, the author does not explain why the 'independent' variable can be represented in the form of Eq. (11), and the parameters such as w_ul, learned using Hebbian rules, lack clear explanations. The learning targets and the specific characteristics of the learning dynamics are also left unaddressed.\n\nSecondly, the author fails to provide a clear description of the entire workflow of the algorithm. It is uncertain whether the sum\u2013product message passing can converge within the given graphical structure. If it does converge, it needs time to do so. It is unclear how many iterations are required for message m_u to converge. If multiple iterations are needed for convergence, the transmission of information from time t+1 to t may be questionable. Actions also affect the transition matrix of HMM, but in Section 3.1, I did not see the author modeling actions.\n\nThe article does not clarify the specific biological correspondences of 'f' and 'm' within the context of sum\u2013product message passing. 'f' appears to correspond to neural connections, but neural connections are typically one-to-one. If 'f' includes more than two nodes, its precise correspondence within a neural circuit is unspecified. Similarly, the biological interpretation of 'm' is not clearly defined, and the mechanism for nodes to transmit 'm' among each other remains unclear."

Furthermore, I feel the authors should discuss the limitations of their method and better discuss related work. Below, I\u2019ll address specific concerns:\n\n- The method as presented wouldn\u2019t scale to infinite horizon or large POMDPs. At the very least, I\u2019d like to see a discussion on the challenges presented when scaling DHTM.\n- The empirical methodology and agent architecture are poorly explained, which makes it hard to evaluate the method. More direct questions can be found below.\n- The empirical results are of limited value; specifically, the authors use a single custom environment with non-standard metrics (see below for more questions about pseudo-surprise).\n- The paper could be better positioned in the literature regarding successor representations in POMDPs. For example, I expected to see a discussion with [1], which seeks to model an SR in POMDPs.\n\n[1] Eszter Vertes and Maneesh Sahani.

Is this on purpose? If so, could authors comment on this and the difficulties of adapting their estimate with a changing policy?\n- Section 2.3, I\u2019m quite confused about this section; although the SR could be used to model observations, you\u2019ve discussed the SR up to this point as being a good representation of the hidden state. I\u2019m not sure that the expected discounted observation occupancy, given a state, is the same object. It feels like successor features should be discussed here, as there\u2019s an implicit assumption that the reward function lies in the span of the observation features. You might not be able to linearly predict the value function $V(h)$ given $M^\\pi(\\cdot | h) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{O}|}$.\n- Section 4, can you describe how the pseudo-surprise is computed? I\u2019m not sure I fully understand what\u2019s going on here.\n\n### Agent Architecture\n\n- Can you provide more details about the baseline methods and how they are employed in the architecture? e.g., what\u2019s the input to the RNNs?\n- What is an SR representation here? A tabular representation of the SR with respect to the HMM states?"

The authors tested their hypothesis in a 2D pinball environment against LSTM, a transformer based recurrent neural network model (Receptance Weighted Key Value) and a recurrent neural network that has been extended with a linear recurrent unit to handle long sequence modeling tasks (LRU). Considering a metric based on pseudo-surprise, the authors claimed that their model is able to approximate the successor representations better. They also simulated a changing task by comparing successor representations learned using 5-step vs 1-step temporal difference (TD) learning. Unsurprisingly, perhaps due to better reward error propagation, the model that uses the 5-step TD learning algorithm is able to adapt to the second task faster."
