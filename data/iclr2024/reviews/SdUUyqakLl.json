                "value": "I have two major concerns. The first is related to the soundness of the paper; it seems that most theoretical results do not hold currently. My second concern is that highly relevant defenses are not featured in the experiments. I also have other concerns regarding clarity. All my concerns are detailed below.\n\n## Major Weaknesses\n\n1. Proposition 1 is not true as stated, and the proof of Lemma 1 is incorrect:\n\nRegarding Proposition 1, the step leading to Equation (51) is only true if $\\gamma = \\Omega(\\lambda^2)$, which has no reason to hold. If not, even if you take the right-hand side to be (50), it is not possible to take squares to obtain (52) (and the statement of Proposition 1 is not proven). I do not see a possible fix for this issue.\n\nAlso, the proof of Lemma 1 is incorrect; the last inequality in (26) is not true, e.g., take $X=Y$. Fix: If you additionally assume independence, you can get (26) but with square root on the right-hand side. Furthermore, (28) and (29) are clearly incorrect.\n\n2. Since Proposition 1 is incorrect, so is Proposition 2 which relies upon the former. Even if the latter was correct, the stated result is rather superfluous as the $\\rho^2$ (should depend on $t$ by the way) in the lower bound is shown to vanish across iterations by Farhadkhani et al. (2022).\n\n3. In the experiments, the defenses used are not the best when considering data heterogeneity. Only Bucketing (Karimireddy et al., 2021), among all considered defenses, was designed for this purpose. The work of Allouah et al. (2023) propose another defense called NNM and show that it improves upon Bucketing. At least this other defense should be tested to claim having a strong attack in non-iid settings.\n\n## Other Weaknesses\n\n4. The related work section is inaccurate. The second paragraph in Section 2 wrongly mentions that Farhadkhani et al. (2022) studied Byzantine-robustness under data heterogeneity.\n\n5. The term \"skew\" is repeatedly used without a proper definition, although a formal definition is given in page 4 without intuition on what skewness means. It seems throughout the paper that it can be replaced by gradient heterogeneity/dissimilarity. In that case, the insights given are very similar to those of Karimireddy et al., (2021), Allouah et al. (2023), etc.. In fact, skewness is a confusing term; it is widely used when referring to probability distributions, but that definition is quite different from what paper suggests. But again, a proper definition would have cleared this issue.\n\n6. \"Skewed majority\" is inaccurate: if $\\tfrac{f}{n} \\leq 1/3$ then a set of size $n-2f$ does not constitute a majority.\n\n7. The last sentence in Section 4.2 is clearly incorrect: convexity is an additional assumption, which makes the analysis \"easier\" than that of non-convex functions. \n\n8. The choice of search direction, fundamental to the attack presented, seems quite arbitrary. A reference to \"Karl's Pearson's formula\" is quickly given, but without any justification whatsoever of the search direction.\n\n9. Parameter $\\nu$ seems quite redundant with $\\alpha$, especially since the experiments on the role of $\\nu$ suggest that setting $\\nu=1$ is good enough, without giving a guidance or whatsoever on how to choose it."

However, existing works (Karimireddy et al., 2021) have shown that using history information such as momentum can enhance Byzantine robustness. So, what will the lower bound for robust SGD with momentum be? Moreover, although the authors claim that the gradient skew is due to non-IID data, Assumption 2 makes the theoretical analysis restricted to the IID settings, which is confusing. Although I understand that the lower bound for IID settings also holds for more general non-IID settings, the IID assumption (i.e., Assumption 2) prevents obtaining a tighter bound for non-IID settings.\n\n2. Since the adversary clients with STRIKE attacks require more computation cost than benign clients, the authors are suggested to provide theoretical or empirical results of how much extra computation cost will the proposed STRIKE attack take.\n\n\nDue to the abovementioned concerns, I currently give a rating of 5.
