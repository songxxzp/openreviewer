On the claim that \"assuming the same level of information distortion, latent features are always more robust than input representations\", does this hold even if the latent embedding dimension is larger than the input dimension?  If yes, why it can be more robust? Moreover, if the latent embedding dimension is lower than the input dimension, then it has been proven in the ICML 2019 paper \"First-order Adversarial Vulnerability of Neural Networks and Input Dimension\" that the minimal adversarial perturbation scales inversely with the data dimension. So if we treat the latent representations as the new \"data\" and they have lower dimensions than the raw inputs, the new insights are not clear.\n\n2. The assumption on the same level of information distortion seems very strong and lacks justification. It's also not clear what is the threat model (what the attacker can do) that leads to a latent representation $T_{adv}$.\n\n3. The evaluated attacks are naive input perturbation attacks, and no adaptive attacks that take into account modifying the latent representations were studied. It should be easy to add a regularizer to attack objectives to encourage finding adversarial examples that share very similar (or very different) latent representations as the original data, and therefore the claim on improved robustness may not hold."

                "value": "1. In this paper, the attacker only has access to the latent representation provided by the mobile DNN from a mobile phone. While the authors successfully demonstrate that attacks on these latent representations exhibit a lower Attack Success Rate (ASR) than those on raw images\u2014given the same level of information distortion\u2014the appropriateness of imposing an identical distortion level in this context needs more clarification. In discussions around the adversarial robustness of image input, constraints are placed on distortion levels to ensure modifications are imperceptible to the human eye, yet potent enough to deceive the classifier [1]. However, when considering distortions applied to latent features, the rationale for enforcing the same constraint level is less clear. Given that the transmission in this scenario occurs between a mobile device and a cloud computer, with no human observer in the loop, the attacker might as well nullify all latent features, potentially achieving an ASR close to 100%. Comparing the ASR between attacks on raw input images (which are observable by humans) and attacks on latent features (processed by a cloud computer) under an equivalent distortion level seems illogical.\n\n2. Although the authors posit that this study on the robustness of distributed DNNs in the face of adversarial actions is novel, I find the concept markedly similar to existing works on attacks targeting intermediate layers or latent features [2]. I would appreciate it if the authors could highlight the distinctions between their work and prior research, and attempt to apply the attack methods delineated in [2] where feasible.\n\n3. I am confused about two terminologies in the paper: feature compression and bottleneck. Their relationship is not clear to me. In Table 1, it seems that only the first two feature compression methods contain a bottleneck layer. However, in Section 4.2 - DNN architectures, the authors write, '...the feature compression layer (i.e., the 'bottleneck').' Additionally, the authors use the same bottleneck design as Matsubara et al. (2022b) and denote the new architectures with feature compression as Resnet50-fc, etc. However, the specific design mentioned in Matsubara et al. (2022b) does not seem to belong to any of the six feature compression approaches in Table 1. Table A-3 is also confusing, as I cannot understand what the authors mean by 'JC and QT are DNNs without a bottleneck,' while JC and QT are feature compression approaches, and the authors claim that feature compression is the same as bottleneck.\n\n4. The experimental results in Section 5.3 need further explanation. ResNet152-fc with 12 channels achieves a validation accuracy of 77.47%, while ResNet152-fc with 3 channels achieves 70.01% accuracy. On the middle of page 9, the statement 'decreases to 7.47%' should be corrected to 'decreases by 7.46%.' However, the fact that I\u2217(Y ; T) decreases by 7.46% cannot explain why the ASR increases by a much larger percentage than 7.46% in Table A-4. For example, when \\epsilon=0.003, the ASR of PGD_2 increases by 19.9% when transitioning from 12 channels to 3 channels. According to the inequality in Key Theoretical Finding #1, since O(|T||Y|/\u221an) is smaller when transitioning from 12 channels to 3 channels, the ASR difference should be less than the difference in I\u2217(Y ; T), which is 7.46%.

                "value": "This work aims to evaluate the adversarial robustness of distributed DNNs. In this setting, latent representations of the DNNs are communicated among devices, and thus, an adversary could perturb the latent representations instead of the model's input. However, the work claims that attacks on latent representations are less effective than perturbing the input and presents theoretical information bounds supporting this claim. Standard adversarial attacks are then used to test this bound empirically over several distributed DNN architectures, and the results show that the attacks are less successful when employed on latent spaces than on the model's input."

            "strengths": {
                "value": "The suggested information bound entails that standard adversarial attacks targeting only the latent representation of DNNs would be less effective than those targeting the input. This is relevant not only in distributed DNN but for side-channel attacks as well. Moreover, it greatly aids in evaluating the robustness of distributed DNN, as such attacks arise naturally in this setting."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "1. The experimental setup is lacking and insufficient to support the authors' claims. Only attacks on several distributed DNN architectures were reported. Not only is this insufficient to support the claim that attacks on latent spaces are generally less effective, but it does not explain the phenomenon or the behavior of the suggested information bound.\n2. No novel attacks targeting latent spaces were suggested, or even settings in which both the input and latent space are attacked. Without testing such attacks and settings, the robustness of distributed DNN cannot be correctly evaluated.\n3. The second key finding of \"DNN robustness is intrinsically related to the cardinality of the latent space\" is not a phenomenon exclusive to latent spaces. There are several examples of attacks working better on larger input samples such as Imagnet, compared to CIFAR10/100. In addition, the effect of the l_inf norm bound is highly dependent on the input size."
            },
            "questions": {
                "value": "1. For a correct evaluation of the suggested bound on a given DNN architecture, the experimental settings should present attacks on all the latent spaces in the architecture and not only those available in specific distributed DNN settings. The results should be compared for the depth of the latent spaces in the network and their cardinality. Such experiments consider side-channel attacks on DNN and not only the distributed DNN setting.\n2. Attacks targeting explicitly latent spaces should be considered; such attacks should be aware of the specifics of the latent spaces (e.g., depth and cardinality) and make use of them to improve the efficiency of the attack.\n3. Adversarial attacks targeting input and latent representations should be considered to evaluate if such a setting presents a greater risk to distributed DNN. \n4. As the effectiveness of perturbations depends on the input size, the results should be normalized accordingly."
