This may be a side effect of offering a monetary reward based in part on the number of annotations (cf. Appendix G).\n- The sentence-level score may disproportionately favor summaries that contain a large number of (short) sentences. Furthermore, the evaluation of different models does not further investigate whether some of the score differences can be explained by the different length of the summaries (e.g., a shorter summary may be more prone to omissions)."

Considering that Claude used a different temperature than other models, have you investigated how stable the results are when the temperature is varied?\n- Page 7, Section 5, \"Incremental...\" paragraph - shouldn't \"lower\" by \"higher\"?\n- Page 8, top paragraph: \"Highly extractive\" seems to contradict the large proportion of novel trigrams, which would be more indicative of an abstractive summary."

I would be less certain that those books or their summaries are _impossible_ to be part of the training corpus. Modern LLM go well beyond only crawling Internet data and providers have deals with many different publishers. Still, this is arguably one of the most rigorous attempts to create a test set that avoids dataset contamination.\n\n- The evaluation focuses on precision. The standard approach of evaluation summaries is to rely on human-written summaries and the compare those with system-generated. This is very expensive, and creates lots of pitfalls as it depends on the similarity metric used to compare summaries (even without using n-gram overlap metrics, learnt embedding metrics like BERTScore have their own set of biases). Instead, this work focuses on assessing a given summary by asking questions about it.\n\n- It compares the two standard ways of summarizing very long documents: hierarchical (summarizing parts and combining those) and incremental (left to right) with interesting insights  (eg, incremental is preferred for level of detail, but not for other aspects)\n\n\nThis work will certainly be considered a fundamental paper in the coming months and years, and be a required reference and reading for summarization research.

It identifies the following main challenges: 1) the problem of data contamination, that is, most books are already in the pre-training data of large language models; 2) the lack reliable automatic metrics. To solve the first issue, the authors collect a dataset set of 100 recently published books. To address the second issue, they generate summaries for each book with GPT-4, and then ask humans to identify and classify coherence errors such as \"entity omission\", \"causal omission\", and \"duplication\". Then, to automate this process, they prompt GPT-4 to classify sentences in summaries according to the same coherence error taxonomy, and they find the precision of GPT-4 is similar to the human annotators. The coherence annotation by GPT-4 is the basis of BooooKScore, a reference-free automatic metric counts the fraction of sentences in summaries that are free from coherence issues. Finally, the paper evaluates summaries generated by GPT-4, Claude 2, and LLama-2-7B using two techniques: hierarchical merging and incremental updating. They find that GPT-4 and Claude 2 summaries are more coherent and that hierarchical merging also results in more coherent summaries, but at a cost of detail."

Even with some level of truncation, it should still be possible to assess coherence issues.\n\nMinor issue: you mention in section 3 that \"we did not find summaries online for any books in our dataset, which means LLM memorization of these summaries is impossible.\" Not finding results online by no means imply that memorization is impossible. In fact, we have no guarantee that closed-source models such as GPT-4 are trained just on publicly available data."
