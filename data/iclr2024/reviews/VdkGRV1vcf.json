The paper initially presents the concept of \"Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels,\" which is essentially a sliced variation of MMD with Riesz Kernels. The paper demonstrates that Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels qualifies as a metric in the space of probability distributions, having non-negativity, symmetry, triangle inequality, and identity. Additionally, it establishes an equivalence between Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and the MMD with sliced Riesz Kernels. Furthermore, the paper elaborates on the methodology for calculating Sliced MMD with Riesz Kernels and its gradient, showcasing that this approach achieves nearly linear complexity in relation to the support count of two discrete distributions. Lastly, the paper compares the proposed frameworks with other generative modeling techniques, such as NCSN, WGAN, MMD GAN, SIG, SWF, and more."

                "value": "- Concerning Theorem 2:\n\nTheorem 2 establishes bounds between MMD and Wasserstein distance of order 1. In my opinion, these results are not very sharp, and there appears to be an important missing reference here. Under the same assumptions of compact support, the article [1, Theorem 1] demonstrates that the Wasserstein distance $W_1$ is bounded by an MMD with the Coulomb kernel $k(x, y) = -|x - y|^{2-d}$ but without the power dependency of $1/(d+1)$. Since the measures are bounded, MMD with the Riesz kernel and the Coulomb kernel are related by a constant (dependent on the dimension) on the support of the measures. Therefore, it seems important to mention this result and discuss its relevance.\n\nIn a more general sense, I'm having trouble grasping the significance of these bounds for the current article. They don't appear to be entirely novel, and more importantly, they are not utilized subsequently, neither theoretically nor practically, nor in the discussion.\n\n- Regarding Theorem 3:\n\nTheorem 3 is the main contribution of this article, and I agree that it is interesting and significant. However, there is a minor point that needs clarification: while the function $E$ is shown to be differentiable everywhere in the proof, for the differentiability of $V$, the authors use an argument that doesn't seem rigorous. Indeed, the function $x \\to |x-y|$ is not differentiable at $x=y$. In practice, this may not be very important because this event is almost surely zero if the samples come from measures with densities. Still, it's important to note this limitation.\n\n- Regarding the dimension dependency:\n\nAn important aspect that is not detailed in the article is the dependence on dimension. Indeed, the sliced Riesz Kernel is not exactly equal to the Riesz kernel; it differs by a constant that depends on the dimension. As the dimension approaches infinity, this constant $c_{d,r}$ behaves as $O(d^{r/2})$, and thus the rescaled kernel tends to zero as $O(d^{-r/2})$. This suggests that estimating the gradient with a finite number of projections becomes increasingly challenging in high dimensions, as also observed in Figure 2 and the bound in $O(\\sqrt{d/P})$.\n\nThis point is not thoroughly discussed in the article. It would be interesting to visualize the relative error in the gradient not only as a function of the number of projections but also with respect to the dimension.\n\n\n- About training a sequence of neural networks (Section 4.2):\n\nI am having difficulty grasping the intuition behind the iterative training of neural networks $\\Phi_1, \\cdots, \\Phi_L$ to approximate the generation scheme. Why are these networks needed? Does the flow not work without them? What are the results without these networks on CIFAR10 or MNIST, for example?\n\nFurthermore, it seems to me that training a network per step is very costly; I doubt the feasibility of this method. Is this standard practice?\n\n- Regarding the \"related work\" section in the introduction:\n\nI believe that this section could be improved. The paragraph is somewhat confusing as it introduces a set of articles without providing clear context for the current work or establishing connections between the cited articles. As a result, I find this part to be not very illuminating for understanding the related work.\n\n\n- Additional remarks:\n\n  - Figures 1 and 2: The tables are not informative and hard to read. Since the information is already contained in the plots, I don't see the purpose of these tables. I suggest removing them and using the available space for more details on the points described earlier. Additionally, Figure 1 lacks a legend for the runtime (in ms?).\n\n  - The Riesz kernel also defines a valid MMD for $r=2$. So why restrict it to $r \\in (0,2)$ with 2 excluded?\n\n\n  - Unless I am mistaken, the result about $D_{K}$ as a metric on $P_{r/2}$ in (Modeste & Dombry, 2023) is not mentioned anywhere in the cited article. Can you provide more details on this fact or provide the correct reference ?\n\n  - I'm quite curious to know if the approach presented in the article can be generalized to the case of $r \\in (0,2]$? Particularly, the fast gradient computation.\n\n  - It seems that the reference (Numayer & Steidl, 20201, Lemma 3.3) is incorrect, or at least Lemma 3.3 doesn't state that the two MMDs coincide.\n\n- Refs: \n\n[1] Djalil Chafa\u00ef, A.

The MMD distance is a natural distance between distributions, using which one can solve generative modeling problems. So the latter computational problem is quite important for generative modeling based on kernels. It is shown that the MMD distance defined by the Riesz kernel has a very special structure, namely that the so-called sliced Riesz distance coincides with the MMD distance.\nThis allows one to estimate the gradient very precisely because one can take few 1-dimensional projections of empirical points and calculate an averaged sliced MMD. Based on that, authors design a generative modeling algorithm (described in the Appendix as Algorithm 3). Their algorithm performs well, taking into account Table 1, though which part of their algorithm is mainly responsible for such a promising outcome is a non-trivial issue."
