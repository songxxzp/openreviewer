                "value": "The current trend in image restoration methods involves sampling multiple outputs from the posterior distribution rather than generating a single one. This paper has highlighted a fundamental limitation of posterior sampling, specifically in generating semantically distinct possibilities using a reasonably small number of samples. This limitation arises from the heavy-tailed nature of the posterior distribution along semantically relevant directions. As a solution, the paper suggests creating compositions of small but meaningfully diverse outputs. The study also delves into a comprehensive examination of what constitutes a set of reconstructions that are meaningfully diverse. To achieve this, the paper explores various post-processing approaches, including Uniformization, K-Means Centers, and Farthest Point Strategy, to obtain semantically meaningful and diverse outputs using existing image restoration methods. Furthermore, the paper introduces a practical approach for enabling diffusion-based image restoration methods to produce outputs that are meaningfully diverse. The effectiveness of these methods is validated through quantitative measures and user studies, demonstrating their superiority over conventional posterior sampling techniques."

Usual random sampling from the heavy tailed posterior distribution will have samples from high density regions with a much higher probability than from low density regions, making it an impractical approach to generate diverse solutions from limited samples. Given a large number of samples from posterior, the paper explores three approaches to extract limited number of samples representing meaningful diversity. Further, the paper proposes a simple guidance mechanism to improve diversity of solutions. This involves running the diffusion process to simultaneously generate multiple images starting from different noise samples, and encouraging dissimilarity between estimates of clean images at every step. This guidance improves diversity of solutions of recent diffusion based restoration methods while  maintaining reconstruction quality."

The traditional setup is to cast the inverse problem as one of posterior distribution sampling. However, as the authors discussed this may lead to a concentrated set of samples where most of them look very similar to each other. The paper discusses different ways of measuring and modeling diversity in image reconstruction and later introduces a method for generating a given number of samples  conditioned on a low-resolution / low-quality image, maximizing diversity and using a pretrained diffusion model. The method is evaluated on popular benchmarks on two restoration tasks: super-resolution (4/16x, noisy and noiseless) and inpainting."

However, if the authors would like to make the paper better I list a few questions/comments that could be helpful.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the proposed method**. The method seems to do the job, but I wonder if the authors could provide more insight on their proposed solution. For example, a few alternative designs could be:\n    * Instead of increasing distance with respect to NN, just maximize the sample variance (or average pairwise distance as in the reported LPIPS metric)\n    * What happens with the sample average. In the traditional formulation, the average of the generated samples should be close to the posterior mean (which is also another possible estimator that minimizes distortion). Have you tried to compute and compare the sample means w/wo the diversified guidance ? I guess that the mean wouldn't be as good as in the traditional case, but maybe a more robust mean estimator could lead to a very similar result (an estimator that minimizes distortion) \n\n2. **Other Experiments**. In particular regarding Colorization (e.g., one very relevant practical problem is face colorization, can we generate a meaningful diverse set of reconstructed images when starting from a gray photo of a face?)\n\n3. **Connections to other work on GANs** (and mode collapse which seems related).\n\n    * Mao, Q., Lee, H.Y., Tseng, H.Y., Ma, S. and Yang, M.H., 2019.

This paper is not about training models that allow to generate a diverse set of reconstructions. But, I wonder if the authors could give a comment on wether we could incorporate the idea of diverse sample generation also during training. In particular I wonder if the authors could comment on wether this is an interesting thing to consider, for example in the context of conditional generation ([SR3](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/), [Palette](https://iterative-refinement.github.io/palette/)) or current Bridge restoration models ([InDI](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VmyFF5lL3F), [I2SB](https://i2sb.github.io/))"
