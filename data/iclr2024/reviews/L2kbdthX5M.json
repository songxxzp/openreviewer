While many of the videos used are curated from other datasets (e.g., How2Sign), a core contribution is their optimized 3D body (SMPL-X) and hand (MANO) representations for each frame in these datasets. Sign Language transcription forms can vary (e.g., text/gloss/HamNoSys), so one benefit of this work is the inclusion of multiple forms and across languages (English, German SL, French SL, Polish SL, Greek SL). The authors also introduce benchmarks and metrics to facilitate future modeling work. \n\nOn top of this, the authors describe development of an SL production baseline based on VQ-VAE models which shows promise. The videos are compelling and the results are significantly better than Ham2Pose on various metrics."

For example, adding biomechanics constraints on top of the SMPL and MANO computations. \n* The use of multiple SL annotation types (HymNoSys, text, gloss) makes this work useful for working on SL modeling from multiple perspectives. \n* The SL production work is a really nice advanced development of discrete variable model approaches for complex motion synthesis. \n* Related work is well represented and contextualized (although some additional work from the HCI and Accessibility communities could be added)\n* The paper is well written and generally easy to follow (but may be hard to reproduce given the complexities of each model involved)."

In addition to the avatar generation framework, the authors propose an VQ-VAE based SLP approach, which can be prompted by spoken language sentences, words, sign glosses or HamNoSys sequences. This approach is evaluated on the presented benchmark, and the presented qualitative results look promising."

Failure analysis and having SLP with different prompts that are corresponding to the same meaning would have strengthened the submission. \n\n- Overall the presentation quality of the paper can improve significantly. As is it does not meet the expectation of being publication ready (See Questions). \n\nAbout Dataset:\n- This manuscript is framed as a dataset paper, however there is no new data that is collected or will be released. What the paper actually presents is derivative data, i.e. 3D pose estimates from existing datasets, which is disappointing as a reader who was hoping to find a new,  potentially useful data source. \n\n- Although the authors present this dataset as \"large scale\", it still lacks the scale to be considered as one. 70,000 videos is hardly large scale, even considering the contemporary SL alternatives, such as BOBSL or Youtube-ASL. \n\nAbout Pose Estimation Framework:\n- Given one of the main proposed contributions of this paper is the pose estimation framework, I would have expected more qualitative and quantitative results against the state-of-the-art approaches from the model based pose estimation domain. If this is just an application of previously existing approaches, such as (Spurr et al., 2020), then this needs to be clearly stated. \n\nAbout VQ-VAE SLP-based Approach:\n- The proposed VQ-VAE based SLP approach is only evaluated on the presented benchmark dataset, which does not give the reader any anchor points to compare against the state-of-the-art on other benchmarks. Also the authors compare their approach only against the Ham2Pose-3D approach on the new benchmark."

What is \"word\", which is the \"ASL\" dataset? It would have been better to have a clear introduction of the terminology and the source dataset that are utilized just after or before Figure 2. \n\n- \"Moreover, there are over 300 different sign languages across the world, with hearing-impaired people who do not know any SL.\" Can the authors elaborate what they mean here?\n\n- \"Our SL annotations can be categorized into four common types: HamNoSys, spoken language, word, and gloss, which can be used for a variety of downstream applications such as SLP and SLR\".
