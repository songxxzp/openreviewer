Collaborative learning and model partitioning are proposed as solutions, where clients share representations of their data instead of the raw data. The principle of least privilege is introduced, which states that the shared representations should only include information relevant to the task at hand. The authors provide the first formalization of the least-privilege principle for machine learning. They prove that there is a trade-off between the utility of the representations and the leakage of information beyond the task. Experiments on image classification demonstrate that representations with good utility also leak more information about the original data than the task label itself. As a result, censoring techniques that hide specific data attributes cannot achieve the goal of least-privilege learning."

It formalises this notion under strict condition where any attribute other than the task label is deemed as sensitive for leakage. They propose a formal definition of LPP and under strictly positive posterior and the assumption that the label needs to be shared with the service provider, they theorise that there does not exists a a feature map such that both LPP and utility (as defined by mutual information between labels and feature representation) hold simultaneously.  They further support this with pairwise empirical evaluations across 12 attributes where one is considered as label and the other as the adversary\u2019s targeted sensitive attribute. The analysis also compares inference gain under standard and censoring models. \n\nIn my opinion the paper relies on some fundamental assumptions which have been clearly stated\n- First, it\u2019s a worst case analysis. This has also been highlighted in the Problem Setup (Section 2) and the text following Corollary 1.\n- I think the assumption for label information to be made available is pretty strong from a practical perspective as users may not necessarily need to provide labels to the service provider.\n- Unlike unconditional LPP, the LPP is defined with respect to what the authors consider as fundamental limit of leakage from the label."

For example, the clients may download the classification head weights or tune a classification head on local data and compute the labels locally at inference time. This also seems different from Melis et al. 2019, where the clients only compute one embedding layer (rather than a large part of the whole model).\n\n- The definitions and notations lack clarity at times. Most importantly, the information leakage is defined by successful inference of *any* attribute. This may be overly strong as many attributes are less sensitive.

For example, when the client only has access to a small part of the model, would the leakage still be unbalanced on different attributes?\n\n- Could the authors discuss how the theoretical and empirical trade-off (between information leakage and model utility) might change if we only consider a smaller set of attributes (rather than the whole input feature space) as sensitive?\n\nMinor comments regarding clarity:\n- What are the transition orders between random variables in the Markov chain $Y - X - W$ defined in Section 2?\n- In Figure 4, bottom right plot, what is the meaning of color? Why is the third row from the top colored blue despite its negative value? What does a negative model utility $\\tilde{I}_{\\infty}(Y, Z)$ mean?\n- Assumption A requires a positive posterior but does not require any lower bound for the posterior density. Does it mean the posterior could also be arbitrarily close to a point distribution?"
