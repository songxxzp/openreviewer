Given the inherent complexities and resource-intensive nature of running diffusion models continuously during generation, the research investigates the feasibility of early exiting by monitoring token switches across various pre-training checkpoints. The methodology of evaluating Cos between the score function and L2 norm the sample embeddings, and subsequently observing score angle changes, provides a novel insights to assess diffusion models."

The contribution to extend to text generation needs to be assessed. The technique of early stopping is a recognized practice during the inference stage of diffusion models. While the current paper's examination of token switches across different pre-training checkpoints offers a fresh angle, the approach's broader implications and significance in comparison to established methodologies could be further elucidated. \n\nFrom Table 1 main results, we can see the choice of steps also provides very marginal impact to the final performance. It might be beneficial for the research to delve deeper into how this method stands out from or builds upon existing techniques in the field of diffusion models."
