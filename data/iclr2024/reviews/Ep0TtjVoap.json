                "value": "- **Limited of technical novelty**: \n  - Using imitation learning to improve the mathematical reasoning ability of open-source models has been proposed in many recent works, e.g.,\n    - Scaling relationship on learning mathematical reasoning with large language models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825\n    - WizardMath: Empowering Mathematical Reasoning for Large Language Models via Reinforced Evol-Instruct, https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09583\n    - MetaMath: Bootstrap Your Own Mathematical Questions for Large Language Models, https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12284\n    - MAmmoTH: Building Math Generalist Models through Hybrid Instruction Tuning, https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05653\n  - At the Output Space Shaping step, the authors use nucleus sampling to generate more reasoning paths and pick the corrected paths. This is a technique widely used in the works listed above. The only difference is that this paper fixes some of the preceding portions of wrong trajectories, while existing works resample the whole trajectory. However, validating which portions of trajectories are correct is very challenging, and the authors need to **enumerate** possible preceding portions of wrong trajectories, which is time-consuming. In my opinion, the existing method (i.e., re-sampling and picking the correct paths) is simpler and may be more effective.\n\n- **Concerns on reproducibility**: As training data are not provided, reviewers and readers can't check the reproducibility of this paper. Note that existing works like WizardMath, MetaMath, and MAmmoTH have released their training data for the community to reproduce their results. Moreover, checkpoints of TORA are not provided in the appendix for checking reproducibility.\n\n\n\n- \"TORA outperforms WizardMath by around 45% in Algebra and Number Theory, **which is attributed to stimulating and shaping tool-use behavior**.\" From Table 3, we cannot conclude that the better performance of TORA is due to stimulating and shaping tool-use behavior, as \nWizardMath uses augmented data **from LLaMA**, while TORA uses data generated **from GPT-4**. Note that GPT-4 is much more powerful than LLaMA. \n\n- In section 2.2, greedy decoding is used for generating trajectories from GPT-4. Thus, only one path per question can be obtained in TORA-CORPUS dataset. In my opinion, the accuracy of LLaMA trained on TORA-CORPUS has yet to saturate (e.g., plot the accuracy w.r.t. #samples of TORA-CORPUS).  To generate more trajectories, a simple approach (which is widely used in the above works) is to use temperature sampling (rather than greedy decoding)  and pick the correct ones for training.\n\n- As temperature sampling can generate more samples from GPT-4, TORA-CORPUS can be more diverse (compared with greedy decoding). To verify the effectiveness of Output Space Shaping in Section 3.5.2, it is better to **augment more data from GPT-4 and let the accuracy of LLaMA trained on the TORA-CORPUS saturates first**. Otherwise, it is difficult to say whether the improvement of LLaMA is from more training data or the proposed Output Space Shaping.\n\n- Ablation study of hyperparameter $n$ (maximum rounds). in experiments, $n=3$ is used. Question: is the performance of TORA sensitive to $n$?\n\n- writing:\n  - \"forward and backward reasoning, as well as result verification\": references for forward/backward reasoning, verification\n  - \"Addressing these challenges requires complex symbolic reasoning over algebraic expressions\": references for symbolic reasoning \n  - where is the definition of $\\theta$ in (4)?"
