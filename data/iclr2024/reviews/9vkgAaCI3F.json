Readout layer is similar to the final linear probing layers in continual-learning/SSL scenarios. They perform SVD decomposition to get the range and null spaces. The main idea is that the range lets us observe stability, the more changes in that range, the less stability we have. On the other hand, changes in the null space allow plasticity for learning new tasks. Regularization methods restrict changes in both the range and null space, sacrificing plasticity for stability. In contrast, replay methods allow changes in the null space, maintaining plasticity. \nSurprisingly, it may seem like replay-based methods should exhibit substantial catastrophic forgetting, since they allow significant changes to activations in the range of prior readouts. However, the paper shows this is not the case - these methods can maintain strong stability and plasticity. Finally, for a simple linear network, they derive a gradient decomposition algorithm that projects weight updates into the null space to maximize stability without reducing plasticity."

Information theory perspectives or more experimental results might help).\n\n- 4. Any performance guarantees of your proposed optimization algorithm?\n\n- 5. Please comment on any links to PCA, information theory, information bottle neck theory, rate-distortion theory etc. Some helpful pointers:\n\n  - a. PCA\n\n    - i. PCA finds the principal components that capture the directions of maximum variance in a dataset. The readout range identified in this paper spans the subspace aligned with the readout weights. So both are identifying meaningful linear subspaces in high-dimensional data.\n\n    - ii. The readout null space identified is analogous to the null space in PCA - directions that have no variance or are unimportant for the purposes of reconstruction/readout.\n\n  - b. Rate-distortion theory:\n\n    - i. Replay methods allow greater changes in the null space (less compression), maintaining plasticity. Regularization methods over-compress, losing plasticity."

To the best of my understanding, the RDAC framework _interprets_ projections onto the null and range spaces and any changes thereof as representing stability and plasticity in the networks. This seems to be a logical leap that is not verified -- the experiments in section 4 and 5 simply analyse the changes of gradient projections for different networks in these spaces. While I find the connection between the various network hyperparameters and the changes in these spaces interesting, it is not clear whether they truly represent a stability / plasticity tradeoff without experiments also showing how changes in these subspaces are correlated with performance on the continual learning tasks.\n\n2. The linear approximation in the RDAC framework is useful and makes it easy to analyse / apply to a variety of networks. However, given that it is non-trivial to derive a similar framework for non-linear activations or readouts, it is difficult to see how insights from the current linear framework can be extrapolated to the nonlinear setting. While the paper presents results on nonlinear networks in section 4, it is not clear whether these insights will extrapolate to other nonlinear networks. \n\nFurthermore, there are no experiments showing how tuning the regularisation strength for SI, EWC and LwF, or memory strength / replay-buffer size for GEM to achieve a particular balance of stability and plasticity affects network performance in these tasks. This also makes it hard to judge whether the insights derived from the RDAC framework on nonlinear tasks really hold, can be extrapolated to other networks / methods and whether they are useful in developing methods for continual learning.\n\n3. Related to point 2, while it is non-trivial to derive results for nonlinear projections, it would be good to have at least some intuition on how incorrect / applicable insights from a linear approximation would be to nonlinear networks, and whether any future endeavour to derive results for nonlinear networks could correct them."
