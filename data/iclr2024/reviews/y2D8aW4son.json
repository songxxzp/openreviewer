After concatenating the representations and recalled similar patterns as inputs, this paper uses a linear mapping function for prediction.

The proposed SPM-Net just introduces two memory modules to aid prediction.\n- Symbols in all equations are not clearly introduced. For example, what are the sizes of W and A in (1)?\n- All references are cited incorrectly. Most of them should be cited using \\citep{}.\n- There are numerous typos and grammar mistakes in the paper.\n\nModel:\n- Details of the combination part before outputting the final prediction results are missing.\n- It would be beneficial to explain why memory can capture the dependencies and what advantages it has over graph structural learning methods.\"\n\nExperiments:\n- In your released source code, I noticed that in the test set dataloader, you set 'drop_last' to True (batch size=8). However, the Linear (Zeng et al. 2023) paper uses 'drop_last=False' and batch size=32. As you directly use their reported results of Linear for comparisons, there may be some inconsistencies in the experimental setups.\n- The training objective (5) of the memory module (knowledge memory) is basically from the paper by Jiang et al. (2023). Thus, it is recommended to include this spatio-temporal baseline in the experiments. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include more commonly used spatio-temporal datasets in the experiments, such as METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, as suggested by Jiang et al. (2023).\n> [Jiang et al. 2023] AAAI Spatio-Temporal Meta-Graph Learning for Traffic Forecasting \n- Why choose Linear for comparison, not NLinear or DLinear (Zeng et al. 2023)?\n- \"Figure 2 is somewhat challenging to read. It would be better to display the correlation matrix found by the memories to demonstrate the channel dependencies.\n\nDiscussions on channel-independence\n- One recent paper, PatchTST, utilizes channel-independence for multivariate time series. Could you provide some insights on the comparisons between the channel-independence and channel-dependency modeling methods?\n> (PatchTST): A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers\n- For some of the datasets in the paper where the units of variables differ, it is worth considering whether dependency modeling is necessary because PatchTST's performance seems to be good on them by channel independence."
