And does soft merging rely on load balancing loss to prevent expert collapse? \n  - If not, how to specilize the abilities of each expert to obtain the results in Fig. 5 with simple token-level routing without any explicit control?\n  - If indeed we can get specialized experts, does the similar distribution shown in Fig. 5 suggest that the evaluated tasks still have connection with the several training tasks, otherwise it is hard to understand why a linear router can generate such a low entropy distribution on the evaluated tasks with a zero-shot setting?\n  - In other words, if the evaluated tasks differ from the training tasks a lot, the reasonable routing distribution should be close to uniform, especially for a linear router.\n- About parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT):\n  - Another way to view this work is another way to increase amounts of PEFT parameters.\n  - But one perspective of current development of PEFT is that the amount of parameters is the most important, while how you deploy the parameters does not make much differ.\n  - In Tab. 1, comparing LoRA (r=4) & MoV-10, LoRA (r=8) & MoV-30 and LoRA (r=16) & MoV-60 (all pairs with similar learnable parameters), the performance gaps are 2.42%, 1.72% and 0.29%, greatly shrinking with respect to the number of parameters, doubting about the scalability of the proposed method. \n- Overall, \n  - From the perspective of MoE, this paper shares similar architecture with [1], and unfortunately still cannot answer the basic question including why the specialized architecture can benefit instruction tuning on novel tasks.\n  - From the perspective of PEFT, the methods can still not convince me that it is non-trivial to other PEFT methods by simply adding more parameters for better results.\n\n[1] Shen, Sheng, et al. \"Mixture-of-experts meets instruction tuning: A winning combination for large language models.\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.14705* (2023)."
