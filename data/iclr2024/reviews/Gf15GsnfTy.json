The primary baseline additionally evaluated on MetaWorld, Control Suite from vision, and an Isaac Gym-based locomotion task with a single set of hyperparameters (some minor variations). The results presented here would benefit from additional evaluations on more diverse environments.\n-\t**Control Suite performance** (Figure 1): the results would benefit from displaying reference performance of a strong recent continuous actor-critic agent. The benchmark results (throughout) are provided with \u201cGradient steps\u201d on the x-axis, which deviates from the conventional \u201cTime steps\u201d metric. Readability would be improved by adding Figure 1 with \u201cTime steps\u201d to the Appendix and providing the necessary conversion values between \u201cGradient steps\" and \"Time steps\u201d (e.g. gradient steps per time steps ratio).\n-\t**Increasing discretization** (Figure 2 & 4): the robustness of REValueD over increasing discretizations is impressive. Figure 6 of the DecQN paper showed approximately the same performance on both Dog-Walk and Finger-Spin when using 3 vs 21 bins \u2013 do you have an intuition for where this difference is coming from (Figure 6 of DecQN yields ~950 on Finger-Spin and ~850 on Dog-Walk for 21 bins). Is this in part due to the hyperparameter modifications over the original DecQN agent mentioned in Appendix B?\n-\t**Stochastic environments** (Figure 3 & 5): the DecQN paper also introduced a distributional DecQN agent based on the C51 critic in Appendix I with experiments in stochastic environments in Appendix J. Distributional critics can be viewed as an alternative method to ensembling in accounting for variability resulting from exploratory sub-actions, potentially side-stepping the computational overhead of explicit ensembles. Discussion and/or experimental comparison between DecQN+C51 or a distributional version of REValueD and ensembled REValueD would further strengthen the paper (this was briefly mentioned in the conclusion).\n-\tA potential downside of ensembles is the **computational overhead** required for training. It would be interesting to see how the plots compare when plotting time on the x-axis. While Appendix B notes that there is \u201cminimal slowdown\u201d for relatively small ensemble sizes, it would be helpful to quantify this."

In theorem 1 of this paper, the authors claim using Q decomposition may **decrease bias** and **increase variance**. These results seem to contradict each other. Could you clarify any difference in the analyzed settings? \n  - Eqn (3.1) is valid to write since we are defining the parameterization of the Q-function $Q_{\\theta}$, however, in Eqn (4.2) for the term related to $U_i^{\\pi_i}$, the decomposition of the true Q-function $Q^{\\pi}$ might not exist, as discussed in Tang et al. 2022. Could you elaborate what assumptions is the current analysis operating under? \n\n- Fairer comparisons with baselines\n  - The proposed method appears to be modifying DecQN to incorporate (1) ensemble and (2) regularization. In Fig 1, REValueD should be compared to ensembled DecQN and ensembled BDQ for a more \"apples-to-apples\" comparison. \n\n- Other questions: \n  - In Fig 2, why does BDQ perform well on this task but not the tasks in Fig 1? Would BDQ with ensemble perform even better? \n  - Minor presentation suggestion: in Table 2, can you bold best results for each task to make it easier to read? \n\n- References:\n  - Tang et al.
