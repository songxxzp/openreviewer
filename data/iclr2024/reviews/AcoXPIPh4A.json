The authors establish an instance-dependent excess risk bound for ASGD within each eigen-subspace of the data covariance matrix. The theoretical findings show that (i) ASGD outperforms SGD in the subspace of small eigenvalues, exhibiting a faster rate of exponential decay for bias error, while in the subspace of large eigenvalues, its bias error decays slower than SGD; and (ii) the variance error of ASGD is always larger than that of SGD. Our result suggests that ASGD can outperform SGD when the difference between the initialization and the true weight vector is mostly confined to the subspace of small eigenvalues.  Finally, sufficient experiment verify the effectiveness of the theoretical findings."

The variance is shown to be greater, the bias is shown to be greater for the subspace of large eigenvalues, which are the most important ones. The claim in the abstract about ASGD outperforming SGD if the initialization minus optimizers lives in the subspace of the small eigenvalues is true but a bit useless, since it is very unlikely this happens. It is a low dimensional subspace and most of the rest of the space is dominated by the large eigenvalues.  It is informative and of value to have all of the details in this setting that are provided in this work, but the results are weak, essentially a negative result that could have maybe been anticipated for this kind of algorithm."
