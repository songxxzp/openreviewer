More specifically, they conduct an empirical campaign on two relevant methods (i.e., PPO and SAC) to verify that there exist directions with high curvature spanning a subspace that stays relatively stable throughout the training and that contains the gradient. To this end, the authors propose several numerical setups that verify such an existence. All experiments are conducted both for the actor and the critic gradients. Finally, the authors discuss how the existence of these subspaces could be used in practice to advance the state-of-the-art in policy search algorithms."

Further, such a result can have significant implications on developing policy gradient methods, as outlined by the authors: Since deep learning methods often have a large number of parameters, this paper's insights can speed up existing RL methods by restricting optimization to a small fraction of those parameters. It can also result in better exploration techniques.\n\n**Quality and clarity:** The paper does a great job of outlining existing research: it's literature survey and references to relevant works is very thorough.

                "value": "# Major issues (these affect my score significantly):\n\nThe major weakness of the paper is a lack of rigor and concrete results. \n\n## 1. There is a very weak link between the experimental results and the claims made in the paper: ##\n\n(a) For example, see the following claims of the paper:\n- Section 1 (last paragraph): \"(i) parameter-space directions with significantly larger curvature exist in PG\": --> why can we say that the curvature is significantly larger? Figure 1 is highly qualitative in nature. In fact, Figure 2 is essentially qualitative as well. (And larger than what?)\n- Section 1 (last paragraph): \"(iii) the subspace is sufficiently stable to be useful for training\" --> how do the experiments justify the sufficiency? As far as I understand, Figure 3 only shows that the magnitude of the largest eigenvector projected to the subspace is, say, 0.4 for most part of the learning. What does 0.4 mean? How does that imply sufficient stability for learning based on methods that make updates in this subspace?\n- Section 1 (last paragraph): \"observe that the value function subspace often exhibits less variability and retains a larger portion of its gradient compared to the PG subspace\" --> inconclusive (Figure 2 shows very similar trends for actor and critic)\n\n(b) The results for the paper are specifically for well-tuned PPO and SAC agents on specific RL benchmarks, while the conclusions are drawn for general results. For instance, can we be sure that the subspace would also exist for a random hyperparameter configuration? The existence of subspace is even more important for a wide range of hyperparameters, since we won't know the optimal choice apriori for a random problem. Would the subspace be as restricted (for instance a dimensionality of 0.1% of the total parameter values) for a random SAC agent?\n\n(c) Section 4.3 (paragraph 3): \"Similar to the gradient subspace fraction results from Section 4.2, the subspace overlap is more pronounced for the critic than the actor.\" --> why? Are the scales comparable for the actor and critic graphs in Figure 3? Is this \"extra\" overlap really useful for designing algorithms? (Maybe it is, but without any explanations or additional experiments, this information is just speculative.)\n\n## 2. There is no rigorous motivation about various metrics used: ##\nIt seems that the paper adopted the metrics from Gur-Ari et al. (2018) for its experiments. However, these metrics seem somewhat arbitrary, and it is unclear how they relate to the usefulness/existence of the gradient subspace.\n\n(a) Gradient subspace fraction (Eq. 5) seems uninformative. Why showing that the gradient norm in the projected subspace is similar to the original gradient norm helpful? For instance, from the [Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma) we know that any random projection matrix will ensure that the projected gradient norm is not too far away from the actual gradient norm. My point being, the metric in Eq. 5 doesn't seem to be useful right away. Maybe one way to make it more informative would be to establish a scale (so compare the norm of the projected gradient to the Hessian eigenvector subspace and the norm of the gradient projected to random subspaces).\n\n(b) Subspace overlap (Eq. 7): This metric is very complicated and I don't clearly see why it helps with showing the stability of the subspace and what that means for restricting training there. Maybe additional references could help with this.\n\n## 3. Missing details about the implementations: ##\n\nI give some examples below:\n- Section 4.3 (the equation for S_overlap): what is $k$ in the experiments? Does $k$ change with $t$ in the graph?\n- Section 4.3: \"where $v_i$ is the ith largest eigenvector at timestep t\" --> how is the largest eigenvector determined? Is it by the size of the corresponding eigenvalue?\n- Section 4 (paragraph 2): This section is unclear and doesn't provide sufficient details for reproduction (I understand the code does that, but without some details, the paper's results are very difficult to reason about). For instance, SAC usually has multiple Q networks; which ones do the experiments analyze?\n- Page 6, Figure 2: I was not able to understand the difference between the three categories: \"Estimated/true\" gradient, \"estimated/true\" Hessian, and why does that matter (probably Hessian is used to find the projection matrix $P_k$; if so, please explicitly mention it somewhere)? For instance, why do we care about estimated gradients? I understand that estimated Hessian can be important because we will use it to identify the policy gradient subspace and then use it downstream in algorithms. Some more justification about this could be nice.\n- Page 6 (first paragraph): Why was 2%, 0.14%, and 0.07% chosen? These seem highly arbitrary choices. How do the trends change when these numbers are changed?\n- Page 5: cutoffs for Equation 6 seem arbitrary.\n\n# Minor issues / suggestions (these do not affect my score as much; please ignore them if you don't agree):\n- The abstract seems incomplete/misleading in its present form, and it overclaims the contributions of the paper. For instance, it says \"we demonstrate the existence of such gradient subspaces for policy gradient algorithms.\" While this is not technically wrong to say that, the paper only empirically shows these subspaces, and that too for a very limited class of algorithms, i.e. deep policy gradient methods (in fact just two algorithms PPO and SAC). This could be easily rectified, for instance, by including this line from the introduction: \"This paper conducts a comprehensive empirical evaluation of gradient subspaces in the context of PG algorithms, assessing their properties across various simulated RL benchmarks.\" Further, the line \"Our findings reveal promising directions for more efficient reinforcement learning, e.g., through improving parameter-space exploration or enabling second-order optimization.\" seems to be suggesting that the paper also introduces methods for exploiting these subspaces, whereas that is just suggestion for future research.\n- The appendices are not properly referenced anywhere in the paper. At the very least, each section of the appendix should be referenced at the appropriate place in the main paper, explaining what additional details are there. Currently, appendices are a dump of graphs with no accompanying textual explanations (other than the caption). \n- Do you think the \"LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) paper could be added to the related works section as well?\n- In Section 3.1: can $\\gamma$ be 1? Is the setting episodic? \n- In Section 3.1 (paragraph 2): The phrase, \"expected cumulative reward\" could be replaced by \"expected (discounted) cumulative reward\"\n- In Section 3.1 (paragraph 2): \"advantage function ... and can also be defined as\" --> why say \"can also be defined as\"? Isn't that the definition of advantage function? Maybe rephrase the sentence..\n- Section 3.2, first line: Maybe give a reference for the objective function $J(\\theta)$? \n- Section 3.2, first line: Also, the definition of the expectation is unclear: in particular, in its current form, the expression $J = \\mathbb{E}[ \\pi(a_t | s_t) \\hat A_t]$ seems to depend on the timestep $t$. That shouldn't be the case..\n- Section 3.2, first paragraph: What \"estimator of advantage function\" is being used? It is not specified.  \n- Section 3.2, first paragraph (above equation 2): what is the target value for the critic?\n- Section 3.3 (above Eq. 4): \"exponential of the learned Q-function\" --> isn't saying something like a Gibbs distribution or softmax distribution more appropriate?\n- Figure 2: since the \"true gradient\" is just the gradient computed using more state-action pairs, maybe calling it \"true\" is not accurate?"
