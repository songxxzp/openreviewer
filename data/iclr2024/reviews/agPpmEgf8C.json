                "value": "In this work, the authors explore modeling the effect of auxiliary predictive losses on a deep RL agent trained to navigate a spatial gridworld environment. The architecture consists a convolutional encoder that encodes the visual observation, a prediction layer that generates predictions for the auxiliary losses, and a Q-learning agent that takes the encoded state and returns Q-values/actions for the main reward objective. There are two auxiliary losses: a positive sampling loss, which is predicting future states, and negative sampling loss, which encourages representations of non-consecutive states to be distinct from each other. Multiple analyses inspired by neuroscience experiments were employed to show the value of these predictive losses: visualizing the latent state space showing that predictive losses help with representational collapse, showing how long horizon state predictions help with learning new goal locations, looking at how the predictive auxiliary objectives help in producing the \"splitting\" phenomenon, and showing how the encoder (through virtue of prediction) will adapt to novel transition sequences. \n\nOverall, I think this work is cool and exciting. But I do think portions of the submission have clarity that is below the caliber of an iclr paper. I have initially rated marginally below acceptance (5), but I want to assure the authors that most of my issues are with regards to providing clarity/details. I hope to see the incorporation of more clarity and details in the writing during the rebuttal and would be more than happy to re-evaluate my score after such changes."

                "value": "The related works section is a little small/sparse. The authors do a good job in highlighting works on auxiliary predictive losses in RL within the machine learning realm, but I think there is also a growing body of work that is using this framework to produce various behavioral phenomenon in cognitive science/neuroscience. These are complimentary works to the current submission and would be good to include. Here are some examples that I feel should definitely be included:\n\n1. Kumar et al. 2022 NeurIPS use auxiliary predictive losses in RL agents to predict abstractions of the observation, operationalized through language and symbolic programs, in order to reproduce abstract human biases. \n2. Jensen et al. 2023 bioRxiv introduce a predictive auxiliary loss which helps the agent learn when to plan and reproduces replay patterns seen in rodent hippocampal work. \n3. This is not exactly auxiliary predictive loss, but I think it is having the same effect, Binz & Schulz 2022 NeurIPS show adding a regularization term to the loss on the number of bits required to compress the agent's weights reproduces quirks in human exploration.\n\nI think the clarity in some portions in this submission can be improved. \n\n1. On page 4, the description of the auxiliary losses can be improved. Its an important part of the work so it'd be good to have this be as clear as possible. A sentence describing what exactly $\\tau$ is representing and why  $\\mathcal{L_{+}}$ is a loss term that enforces transition structure in the state representations would be very helpful. Also, for the third term in $\\mathcal{L_{+}}$, shouldn't it be $\\tau (z_{t+1},a_{t+1})$ and not $\\tau (o_{t+1},a_{t+1})$? For the negative sampling loss term, making it explicit $z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are latent representations of states that are not consecutive in the same area where the loss term is introduced would be helpful. It'd also be good to have a sentence explaining the motivation for choosing these two specific auxiliary losses. I suspect its loosely inspired by pattern completion vs pattern seperation in hippocampus (respectively) but it would be good to confirm that in this section. \n\n2. It would be helpful to state what the colors in Figure 2D mean. It wasn't clear to me upon first read. \n\n3. The memory component in page 8 is not explained at all. It seems important to describe what this is to put Fig. 4's results in context. \n\nThere are a couple of design decisions that left me a little confused (details in the questions section). It would be nice for the authors to clarify the motivations behind them.\n\nLast, I don't think there was any section in the paper explicitly discussing the limitations of the work. I think this is an important part of any iclr paper so it'd be good to include one. \n\nReferences:\n1. Kumar, S., Correa, C. G., Dasgupta, I., Marjieh, R., Hu, M.

                "value": "1. Why use an off-policy learner (Q-learning) rather than on-policy? An on-policy learner would seem to be more biologically realistic. Also I think an actor-critic approach (e.g. A2C, PPO, etc) may reflect what striatum is doing more than Q-learning? \n\n2. Is there a reason why there is no recurrence in the model? Striatum will indirectly project back to sensory cortex via thalamus. Also it may be possible that hippocampus projects back to sensory visual cortex. Hippocampal activity early in a trial can be predictive of information in visual cortex at a later time in the trial (see Hindy et al. 2016 Nature Neuroscience). Regardless of the biological realism of these recurrent connections, I think there could be useful normative principles in having recurrent loops between modules in this architecture. \n\n3. Fig 5c: The change in firing rates seem pretty small between before/after exposure. Are these changes statistically significant?\n\nReferences:\nHindy, N. C., Ng, F. Y., & Turk-Browne, N. B. (2016).

They also demonstrate that increasing the time horizon for predictive learning produces networks that retrain faster on new tasks in the same environment.  Interestingly, the learned representation is crucial for this as scrambling the transition structure results in much slower learning.
