                "value": "The paper combines graph neural networks to model a control flow in binaries with centroid based losses. Since both paradigms are well known (authors fails to reference centroid based losses such as arc-face [1] or center loss [2]. The approach to out-of-distribution detection (ood) is similar to that in [3], albeit that in the proposed paper might be computationally cheaper due to replacing k-nn with a distance to a center. \nI think that the paper is a solid work, but targets the wrong audience. ICLR papers, in my opinion, should be more about new general approaches or new domains which are important and very different from other domains, such that they require special methods or the prior art is failing. This manuscript is more about combining existing tools in a nice application and would be more suited to a good security conference.\nAs a comment, I do not think that the proposed approach solves the ood. I see the problem of OOD inherent to NN implementing injective map (not surjective). This means that many semantically different samples gets mapped by NN to the same region with the same score. The proposed method decrease this problem, but does not remove it.\n\n\n\n[1] Deng, Jiankang, et al. \"Arcface: Additive angular margin loss for deep face recognition.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2019.\n\n[2] Wen, Yandong, et al. \"A discriminative feature learning approach for deep face recognition.\" Computer Vision\u2013ECCV 2016: 14th European Conference, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, October 11\u201314, 2016, Proceedings, Part VII 14.
