In the related studies, the authors explained that the difference between SLTH and LTH is that SLTH assumes there are strong subnets in dense models without training. However, the methods and experiments involve model training. Therefore, it is necessary to compare dynamic sparse training methods in LTH.\n2. Soft pruning was directly added to iEP and the best-performing learning rate rewinding setting during the experiment. Need ablation studies: (1) decompose soft pruning and iEP to examine which contributes most; (2) combine soft pruning with different variants of iterative pruning to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n3. Similar to cons 1, related studies compared in the experiment only include IteRand about iterative pruning. And IteRand is not implemented with the Wide ResNet-50 setting.\n4. Figure 6(b) is difficult to comprehend, as the x-axis and the red and blue lines all refer to the weight remaining rate.\n5. DST based approaches like RigL and ITOP should serve as necessary baselines for empirical comparisons.\n6. The comparison in Figure 5 is unfair. Although the dense network (ResNet18) has similar parameters counts with a sparse ResNet50, the former needs much less training time since the proposed sparsity is unstructured and hard for acceleration. More discussions are needed to avoid misleading.\n7. Also, the dense baseline performance is weak. Based on previous literature like https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04092.pdf, the dense ResNet-18 on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 can reach ~95% and ~77% respectively, which are ~5% and ~17% accuracies better then the ones in Figure 5."

Specifically, without iterative pruning, we can easily get the desired subnetwork (winning ticket) in one-shot training. The proposed technique misses the key advantage of the EP algorithm as the proposed Soft iEP requires iterative pruning. Therefore, the proposed technique may be computationally expensive and may limit its applicability in crucial domains such as large language models (LLM) where the computational cost is very expensive. \n* The proposed techniques miss the multiple baselines that do not require iterative pruning but still perform exploration [1, 2, 3]. It is important to discuss how their proposed technique compares with those techniques in terms of methodology as well as experimental results. \n* It would be interesting to see how the dying edge phenomenon scales with respect to the size of the network. It may be the case that for the bigger architecture model, the impact of the dying edge is less. To assess the robustness of the proposed technique for different architectures, the authors may be required to consider the higher capacity models (such as ResNet101, ViT) especially for the Cifar10 and Cifar100 datasets. \n\n **References:**\n1.

Specifically, this paper first explores the Edge Popup (EP) algorithm of SLTH that learns the sparse mask with a popup score, rather than update the weights, and empirically finds that EP results in a high ratio of dying edges, which is the edge that is never selected until the termination of the algorithm. As a result, the performance of the SLTH is hindered. To address this issue, this paper proposes Soft Iterative EP (Soft IEP). Soft IEP is the first attempt that applies the common iterative pruning method from LTH to SLTH. Besides, Soft IEP also suggests soft pruning, where are edges can be selected at the end of the EP. Experiments results on CIFAR and ImageNet with different architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Soft IEP."

Besides, the empirical analysis of EP from the dying ratio perspective is interesting, which has never been explored before. Moreover, this paper also present many evidence to support the claim about dying ratio. \n\n- The proposed solution with iterative pruning and soft edge is simple yet effective and well-motivated. \n\n- This paper is well-written and easy to follow."

                "value": "- It\u2019s better if this paper could discuss more benefits of SLTH. What is the major benefits of only learning mask, rather than weights? What is the current performance gap between learning mask and learning weights.  For example, based on Figure 5, we can see that a ResNet-50 with 8 millions number of parameters only achieve a performance around 70%, while at this 66% (1 - 8 / 23) sparsity level, many previous LTH with unstructured pruning  have show that they can still almost match the performance of the dense net (~76%). Thus, there is still a huge performance gap for SLTH-based methods. I would suggest the authors highlight the practical benefit of SLTH, and also show the performance gap with weight-based LTH.  \n \n- The novelty of applying iterative pruning to the SLTH is kind of limited. Although this paper claims that iterative pruning has not been evaluated in SLTH, the proposed idea is not exciting considering that iterative pruning has been massively explored in the LTH community. \n\n\n- The investigation of the relationship between dying ratio and performance may be unclear. This paper explores different hyperparameters to optimize EP, including batch size, learning rate, etc. However, it\u2019s unclear whether these hyper parameters themselves will hinders the performance. For example, it\u2019s common that different optimizer will result in different performance when you learn the weights. Thus, the causal relationship between them (\u201c\u201dhigh dying ratio hinders the performance) cannot be verified. Besides, it\u2019s unclear why change these hyperparameters can result in different dying ratio. It\u2019s better for this paper to illustrate their relationship.  \n\n\n- It would be advantageous to include mathematical formulations for the proposed soft edge. The current draft employs plain language to convey the concept, ensuring ease of comprehension but lacking the necessary technical rigor."
