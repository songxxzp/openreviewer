The paper analyzes through experiments flexibility as a function of the optimizer, neural network architecture, as well as the dataset. On top of these factors, the paper also considers a large number of variations such as regularization, scaling law, random features and labels, and activation functions. Based on the experimental results, the paper makes several logical conclusions that summarize their findings."

In particular, previous works studying expressiveness solely consider the impact of the number of parameters and the architecture. On the contrary, in this paper, a more fine-grained (and thus more practical) analysis is performed by considering more decisive factors in the training.\n\n2. Some conclusions of the paper are quite interesting. For instance, they found that i). there is a correlation between the increase in EDC going from random labels to semantic labels, and the generalization ability, ii). neural networks are worse than linear models at fitting random labels, and iii). ReLU activations result in higher flexibility though originally designed to mitigate vanishing and exploding gradients, etc."

                "value": "1. The measurement of EDC may have some flaws:\n\n    a). The paper takes the strategy of gradually increasing the number of training samples. However, the paper does not discuss how many different trials are run for each setting, and no error bars are plotted. In the very extreme case, there can be some unlucky bad initialization of the neural network that prevented a model from fitting training samples thus causing the EDC to stop growing for that setting. However, this rare case may not be representative of what happens in most cases.\n\n    b). I am not sure why the paper performs the sanity check that each training reached a minimum rather than a saddle point. Since an important consideration of the paper is to evaluate EDC based on the performance of different optimizers, whether the optimizer stopped at a local minimum, global minimum, or saddle points should be a property of the optimizer and it should not be influenced by the experiment design.\n\n2. The paper stops at observation at the surface and does not investigate deeper reasons. For instance, while it is interesting to observe that neural networks are worse than linear models at fitting random labels, the paper should really investigate what is the reason behind such a phenomenon, and potentially answer the question of whether we should really care about this property of NN and linear models in practice. This issue also holds for other conclusions of the paper.\n\n3. Some conclusions of the paper are questionable:\n\n    a). \u201dFlexibility across modalities\u201d. Is the result that tabular datasets have larger EDC a consequence of simpler tasks?\n\n    b). \u201dCNN has larger EDC than MLP\u201d. It seems that the experiments are performed only on vision tasks, which makes the conclusion trivial. Does the same result hold on other tasks?\n\n4. Experimental settings are questionable:\n\n    a). I am more sure, when investigating the influence of architecture and over-parameterization, what optimizer settings are the paper using. Is the paper fixing an optimizer, or is the paper trying all optimizers and picking the best-performing one?\n\n    b). Regarding the experiment of scaling up the image sizes, is the filter size also scaled up accordingly?\n\n5. The fact that labels are fit to 100% accuracy may affect the conclusion of some experiments related to generalization since there can be outliers that negatively affect the generalization ability."

Informally, EDC is the largest subset of training data that can be correctly classified/interpolated by the neural network when trained without augmentation. Unlike the complexity of the hypothesis space, such as the VC dimension, EDC factors into account the entire training protocol. Borrowing intuition from linear classifiers, it extends the notion of parameter count. \n\nThe authors present many interesting findings and insightful discussions. For instance, the authors find that the difference between EDC on true labels and EDC on random labels to be a strong predictor of generalization ($<-0.8$ Pearson correlation coefficient). They also find that the scaling recipe in EfficientNet also improves EDC. Also, more classes make fitting data harder with semantic labels but easier with random ones, and so on. Overall I think it's a good empirical study but would benefit a lot from a more precise discussion/explanation in several places."

            "weaknesses": {
                "value": "- First, the notion of EDC is identical to the Effective Model Complexity (Nakkiran, et al. 2021), which the authors cite but do not really compare with. Both correspond to the largest subset of training data that is interpolated by the model. However, the authors exercise caution when using it (e.g. by checking the norm of the gradients and the flatness of the loss curve, etc) to make sure that the models are not undertrained. I would recommend that the authors refrain from claiming novelty in the notion of EDC and simply center their contribution around the empirical investigation of the Effective Model Complexity, instead.\n\n- The second primary weakness in my opinion is the lack of clarity about the experimental details in a few places. \n  * When comparing different architectures such as CNNs and ViTs, how did the authors ensure that the architectures are compared fairly? For example, there is no mention of the number of parameters used in each architecture. Even if those architectures share the same parameter count, the shape of the architecture can have a big impact as the authors themselves study for CNNs. It's not clear if one can conclude, for example, that CNNs are more parameter efficient than ViTs. There aren't enough details in the paper for the reader.\n  * The authors mention repeatedly that ReLU improves EDC even though they \"were introduced to neural networks to prevent vanishing and exploding gradients.\" I do not see the discrepancy here. ReLU were introduced to prevent training instability issues so I would expect ReLU to improve training and improve EDC as a result. It is unclear why the authors highlight that the impact of ReLU on EDC is surprising. \n  * When the authors compare different datasets, like CIFAR10/100, MNIST, and ImageNet, they use these results to argue for the impact of the input distribution. However, those datasets have different number of classes. One way to fix that issue is to fix the number of random labels in all datasets. There is no discussion of this in the paper and it seems that the authors kept the label space unchanged. The problem is that it is not clear (again) when the input distribution matters much when accounting for the differences in the number of classes.\n  * In many figures, the authors average log(EDC). Is it reasonable to average them? Wouldn't the average EDC be dominated by what happens to large models? Perhaps it would be better to report the raw results without averaging.\n \n- Some minor comments: \n  * The author should provide precise definitions of some of the terms they use. For example, what is \"parameter-efficient\"? My understanding is that it is EDC divided by the parameter count. Is this the case?\n  * The figures are not presented in the same order they appear in the main text. \n  * Figure 2(b) is very difficult to understand. Are the authors here scaling a single dimension at a time using EfficientNet scaling recipe and reporting the average results?\n  * Page 6: typo in \"we three neural network\"\n  * It would be interesting to see of the scaling laws derived for ViT [1] would also increase EDC, similar to the analysis that was done on EfficientNet. \n\n[1] Alabdulmohsin, Ibrahim, et al. \"Getting ViT in Shape: Scaling Laws for Compute-Optimal Model Design.\" NeurIPS, 2023."
