Not to mention the computational efficiency.\n\n3. Possible test data leakage. The training corpus of GPT includes papers from arXiv, implying that the GPT model may already be aware of the test node labels, that is, the paper's field. This can be tested by directly asking GPT about a paper\u2019s field, given its text-attributes (title and abstraction).
